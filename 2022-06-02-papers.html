<h3>Diffusion coefficient and power spectrum of active particles with a microscopically reversible mechanism of self-propelling</h3>

Catalytically active macromolecules are envisioned as key building blocks in
development of artificial nanomotors. However, theory and experiments report
conflicting findings regarding their dynamics. The lack of consensus is mostly
caused by a limited understanding of specifics of self-propulsion mechanisms at
the nanoscale. Here, we study a generic model of a self-propelled nanoparticle
that does not rely on a particular mechanism. Instead, its main assumption is
the fundamental symmetry of microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions: the
principle of microscopic reversibility. Significant consequences of this
assumption arise if we subject the particle to an action of an external
time-periodic force. The particle diffusion coefficient is then enhanced
compared to the unbiased dynamics. The enhancement can be controlled by the
force amplitude and frequency. We also derive the power spectrum of particle
trajectories. Among new effects stemming from the microscopic reversibility are
the enhancement of the spectrum at all frequencies and sigmoid-shaped
transitions and a peak at characteristic frequencies of rotational diffusion
and external forcing. The microscopic reversibility is a generic property of a
broad class of chemical reactions, therefore we expect that the presented
results will motivate new experimental studies aimed at testing of our
predictions. This could provide new insights into dynamics of catalytic
macromolecules.

<h3>Hard superconducting gap in a high-mobility semiconductor</h3>

The co-integration of spin, superconducting and topological systems is
emerging as an exciting pathway for scalable and high-fidelity quantum
information technology. High-mobility planar germanium is a front-runner
semiconductor for building quantum processors with spin-qubits, but the lack of
a pristine interface with a superconductor has slowed progress with hybrid
superconductor-semiconductor devices. Here we take this step and demonstrate a
low-disorder, oxide-free interface between high-mobility planar germanium and a
germanosilicide parent superconductor. This superconducting contact is formed
by the thermally-activated solid phase reaction between a metal (Pt) and the
semiconductor heterostructure (Ge/SiGe). Electrical characterization reveals
near-unity transparency in Josephson junctions, hard induced superconducting
gap in quantum point contacts, phase control of a Josephson junction in a
superconducting quantum interference device, and a superconducting to
insulating transition in gated two-dimensional superconductor-semiconductor
arrays. These results expand the quantum technology toolbox in germanium and
provide new avenues for exploring monolithic superconductor-semiconductor
quantum circuits towards scalable quantum information processing.
