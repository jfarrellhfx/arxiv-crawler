<h3>The most probable path of an active Brownian particle</h3>

Fluctuations in active matter systems frequently cause qualitatively
distinguished behavior as rare events such as slit passing and escape from
near-wall trapping. As a first step to analyzing these rare events, we
investigate the most probable path of a single active Brownian particle using
the Onsager-Machlup integral and its variational principle. We show that the
most probable path obeys the extremum conditions by demonstrating an analogy
with the pendulum equation. As a demonstration, we numerically solve the
extremum conditions for the case of front translation and obtain multiple
independent paths. We conclude that the nontrivial U-shaped path is the most
probable after comparing the probability of each obtained path. We also discuss
further applications of our methods in evaluating the rare events in the active
matter.
