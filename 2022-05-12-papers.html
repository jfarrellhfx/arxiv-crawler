<h3>Optically-triggered strain-driven NÃ©el vector manipulation in a metallic antiferromagnet</h3>

The absence of stray fields, their insensitivity to external magnetic fields,
and ultrafast dynamics make antiferromagnets promising candidates for active
elements in spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate manipulation of the
N\'{e}el vector in the metallic collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au by combining
strain and femtosecond laser excitation. Applying tensile strain along either
of the two in-plane easy axes and locally exciting the sample by a train of
femtosecond pulses, we align the N\'{e}el vector along the direction controlled
by the applied strain. The dependence on the laser fluence and strain suggests
the alignment is a result of optically-triggered depinning of 90$^{\mathrm{o}}$
domain walls and their sliding in the direction of the free energy gradient,
governed by the magneto-elastic coupling. The resulting, switchable, state is
stable at room temperature and insensitive to magnetic fields. Such an approach
may provide ways to realize robust high-density memory device with switching
timescales in the picosecond range.

<h3>Tunable photochemical deposition of silver nanostructures on layered ferroelectric CuInP$_2$S6</h3>

2D layered ferroelectric materials such as CuInP$_2$S6 (CIPS) are promising
candidates for novel and high-performance photocatalysts, owning to their
ultrathin layer thickness, strong interlayer coupling, and intrinsic
spontaneous polarization, while how to control the photocatalytic activity in
layered CIPS remains unexplored. In this work, we report for the first time the
photocatalytic activity of ferroelectric CIPS for the chemical deposition of
silver nanostructures (AgNSs). The results show that the shape and spatial
distribution of AgNSs on CIPS are tunable by controlling layer thickness,
environmental temperature, and light wavelength. The ferroelectric polarization
in CIPS plays a critical role in tunable AgNS photodeposition, as evidenced by
layer thickness and temperature dependence experiments. We further reveal that
AgNS photodeposition process starts from the active site creation, selective
nanoparticle nucleation/aggregation, to the continuous film formation.
Moreover, AgNS/CIPS heterostructures prepared by photodeposition exhibit
excellent resistance switching behavior and good surface enhancement Raman
Scattering activity. Our findings provide new insight into the photocatalytic
activity of layered ferroelectrics and offer a new material platform for
advanced functional device applications in smart memristors and enhanced
chemical sensors.
