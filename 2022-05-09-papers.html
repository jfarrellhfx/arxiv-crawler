<h3>Higher-order in-and-outeractions reveal synergy and logical dependence beyond Shannon-information</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04440v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04440v1</a>

Information-theoretic quantities reveal dependencies among variables in the
structure of joint, marginal, and conditional entropies, but leave some
fundamentally different systems indistinguishable. Furthermore, there is no
consensus on how to construct and interpret a higher-order generalisation of
mutual information (MI). In this manuscript, we show that a recently proposed
model-free definition of higher-order interactions amongst binary variables
(MFIs), like mutual information, is a M\"obius inversion on a Boolean algebra,
but of surprisal instead of entropy. This gives an information-theoretic
interpretation to the MFIs, and by extension to Ising interactions. We study
the dual objects to MI and MFIs on the order-reversed lattice, and find that
dual MI is related to the previously studied differential mutual information,
while dual interactions (outeractions) are interactions with respect to a
different background state. Unlike mutual information, in- and outeractions
uniquely identify all six 2-input logic gates, the dy- and triadic
distributions, and different causal dynamics that are identical in terms of
their Shannon-information content.

<h3>Short-time dynamics in active systems: the Vicsek model</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04436v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04436v1</a>

We study the short-time dynamics (STD) of the Vicsek model with vector noise.
The study of STD has proved to be very useful in the determination of the
critical point, critical exponents, and spinodal points in equilibrium phase
transitions. Here we aim to test its applicability in active systems. We find
that, despite the essential non-equilibrium characteristics of the VM (absence
of detailed balance, activity), the STD presents qualitatively the same
phenomenology as in equilibrium systems. From the STD one can distinguish
whether the transition is continuous or discontinuous (which we have checked
also computing the Binder cumulant). When the transition is continuous, one can
determine the critical point and the critical exponents.

<h3>Coleman-Weinberg Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04394v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04394v1</a>
<br>
<i>Minoru Eto, Yu Hamada, Ryusuke Jinno, Muneto Nitta, Masatoshi Yamada</i>
<br>
<br>
We study properties of Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) strings with the
Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential, which we call CW-ANO strings. While the
scale-invariant scalar potential has a topologically trivial vacuum admitting
no strings at the classical level, quantum correction allows topologically
nontrivial vacua and stable string solutions. We find that the system of the CW
potential exhibits significant difference from that of the conventional
Abelian-Higgs model with the quadratic-quartic potential. While a
single-winding string is qualitatively similar in both systems, and the static
intervortex force between two strings at large distance is attractive/repulsive
in the type-I/II regime for both, that between two CW-ANO strings exhibits a
nontrivial structure. It develops an energy barrier between them at
intermediate distance, implying that the string with winding number $n > 1$ can
constitute a metastable bound state even in the type-II regime. We name such a
superconductor type-$\overline{1.5}$. We also discuss implications to
high-energy physics and cosmology.

<h3>Temperature gradient-driven magnetic skyrmion motion</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04385v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04385v1</a>

<br>

The static and dynamic properties of skyrmions have recently received
increased attention due to the potential application of skyrmions as
information carriers and for unconventional computing. While the current-driven
dynamics has been explored deeply, both theoretically and experimentally, the
theory of temperature gradient-induced dynamics - Skyrmion-Caloritronics - is
still at its early stages of development. Here, we move the topic forward by
identifying the role of entropic torques due to the temperature dependence of
magnetic parameters. Our results show that, skyrmions move towards higher
temperatures in single-layer ferromagnets with interfacial Dzyaloshinski-Moriya
interactions, whereas, in multilayers, they move to lower temperatures. We
analytically and numerically demonstrate that the opposite behaviors are due to
different scaling relations of the material parameters as well as a
non-negligible magnetostatic field gradient in multilayers. We also find a
spatially dependent skyrmion Hall angle in multilayers hosting hybrid skyrmions
due to variations of the thickness dependent chirality as the skyrmion moves
along the temperature gradient.

<h3>Athermal fluctuations in three dimensional disordered crystals</h3>

We study jammed near-crystalline materials composed of frictionless spheres
in three dimensions. We analyze the fluctuations in positions and forces
produced by small polydispersity in particle sizes. We develop a formulation
that exactly predicts the changes in positions and forces as a response to the
changes in particle radii. We show that fluctuations in forces orthogonal to
the lattice directions are highly constrained as compared to the fluctuations
along lattice directions. Additionally, we analyze the correlations in the
displacement fields produced by the microscopic disorder, which we show
displays long-ranged behaviour.

<h3>Doping and gap-size dependence of high-harmonic generation in graphene : Importance of consistent formulation of light-matter coupling</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04115v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04115v1</a>
<br>
<i>Yuta Murakami, Michael Schler</i>
<br>
<br>
The high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids is a fundamental nonlinear
phenomenon, which can be efficiently controlled by modifying system parameters
such as doping-level and temperature. In order to correctly predict the
dependence of HHG on these parameters, consistent theoretical formulation of
the light-matter coupling is crucial. Recently, contributions to the current
that are often missing in the HHG analysis based on the semiconductor Bloch
equations have been pointed out [J. Wilhelm, et.al. PRB 103 125419 (2021)]. In
this paper, by systematically analyzing the doping and gap-size dependence of
HHG in gapped graphene, we discuss the practical impact of such terms. In
particular, we focus on the role of the current $J_{\rm ra}^{(2)}$, which
originates from the modification of the intraband dipole via interband
transition. When the gap is small and the system is close to half filling,
intraband and interband currents mostly cancel, thus suppressing the HHG signal
-- an important property that is broken when neglecting $J_{\rm ra}^{(2)}$.
Furthermore, without $J_{\rm ra}^{(2)}$, the doping and gap-size dependence of
HHG becomes qualitative different from the full evaluation. Our results
demonstrate the importance of the consistent expression of the current to study
the parameter dependence of HHG for the small gap systems.

<h3>Onset of nonlinear electroosmotic flow under AC electric field</h3>

Nonlinearity of electroosmotic flows (EOFs) is ubiquitous and plays a crucial
role in the mass and energy transfer in ion transport, specimen mixing,
electrochemistry reaction, and electric energy storage and utilizing. When and
how the transition from a linear regime to a nonlinear one is essential for
understanding, prohibiting or utilizing nonlinear EOF. However, suffers the
lacking of reliable experimental instruments with high spatial and temporal
resolutions, the investigation of the onset of nonlinear EOF still stays in
theory. Herein, we experimentally studied the velocity fluctuations of EOFs
driven by AC electric field via ultra-sensitive fluorescent blinking tricks.
The linear and nonlinear AC EOFs are successfully identified from both the time
trace and energy spectra of velocity fluctuations. The critical electric field
($E_{A,C}$) separating the two statuses is determined and is discovered by
defining a generalized scaling law with respect to the convection velocity
($U$) and AC frequency ($f_f$) as $E_{A,C}$~${f_f}^{0.48-0.027U}$. The
universal control parameters are determined with surprising accuracy for
governing the status of AC EOFs. We hope the current investigation could be
essential in the development of both theory and applications of nonlinear EOF.

<h3>Observation of fractal topological states in acoustic metamaterials</h3>

Topological phases of matter have been extensively investigated in solid
state materials and classical wave systems with integer dimensions. However,
topological states in non-integer dimensions remain largely unexplored.
Fractals, being nearly the same at different scales, are one of the intriguing
complex geometries with non-integer dimensions. Here, we demonstrate acoustic
Sierpi\'nski fractal topological insulators with unconventional higher-order
topological phenomena via consistent theory and experiments. We discover
abundant topological edge and corner states emerging in our acoustic systems
due to the rich edge and corner boundaries inside the fractals. Interestingly,
the numbers of the edge and corner states scale the same as the bulk states
with the system size and the exponents coincide with the Hausdorff fractal
dimension of the Sierpi\'nski carpet. Furthermore, the emergent corner states
exhibit unconventional spectrum and wave patterns. Our study opens a pathway
toward topological states in fractal geometries.

<h3>Plasmons in Z2 Topological Insulators</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04062v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04062v1</a>
<br>
<i>Yuling Guan, Stephan Haas, Henning Schlomer, Zhihao Jiang</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the collective plasmonic excitations in two-dimensional Z2
topological insulators using the random phase approximation (RPA). In the
Kane-Mele model, the topologically non-trivial quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase is
in a time reversal invariant electronic state with a bulk gap and gapless edge
modes. This is a state of matter that has a quantized spin Hall conductance and
a vanishing charge Hall conductance. We first consider a nano-ribbon structure
with zigzag edges. Here, strongly localized low-energy plasmonic excitations
are observed in the topologically non-trivial regime, with induced charge
density distribution confined to the boundaries in the QSH phase. We
demonstrate how the time reversal symmetry and the Z2 topological phase are
affected by a Zeeman field, thus altering the plasmonic edge states.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that plasmonic edge modes are also observed at the
zigzag boundaries of diamond-shaped nanoflakes in the topologically non-trivial
regime.

<h3>Approaches to the classification of complex systems: Words, texts, and more</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04060v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04060v1</a>
<br>
<i>Andrij Rovenchak</i>

The Chapter starts with introductory information about quantitative
linguistics notions, like rank--frequency dependence, Zipf's law, frequency
spectra, etc. Similarities in distributions of words in texts with level
occupation in quantum ensembles hint at a superficial analogy with statistical
physics. This enables one to define various parameters for texts based on this
physical analogy, including "temperature", "chemical potential", entropy, and
some others. Such parameters provide a set of variables to classify texts
serving as an example of complex systems. Moreover, texts are perhaps the
easiest complex systems to collect and analyze.
  Similar approaches can be developed to study, for instance, genomes due to
well-known linguistic analogies. We consider a couple of approaches to define
nucleotide sequences in mitochondrial DNAs and viral RNAs and demonstrate their
possible application as an auxiliary tool for comparative analysis of genomes.
  Finally, we discuss entropy as one of the parameters, which can be easily
computed from rank--frequency dependences. Being a discriminating parameter in
some problems of classification of complex systems, entropy can be given a
proper interpretation only in a limited class of problems. Its overall role and
significance remain an open issue so far.
