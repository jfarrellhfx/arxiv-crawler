<h3>Calorimetry for active systems</h3>

(Thermal) active systems are in physical contact with (at least) two
reservoirs: one which is often chemical or radiative and source of low entropy,
and one which can be identified with a thermal bath or environment in which
energy gets dissipated. Perturbing the temperature, the heat capacity measures
the excess heat in addition to the steady ever-existing dissipation. Simulating
AC-calorimetry, we numerically evaluate the heat capacity for run-and-tumble
particles in double-well and periodic potentials. Low-temperature Schottky-like
peaks show the role of activity and indicate shape transitions, while regimes
of negative heat capacity appear at higher propulsion speeds.

<h3>Universal anomalous fluctuations in charged single-file systems</h3>

Conventional classification of dynamical phenomena is based on universal
hydrodynamic relaxation characterized by algebraic dynamical exponents and
asymptotic scaling of the dynamical structure factor. This work uncovers a
novel type of dynamical universality reflected in statistical properties of
macroscopic fluctuating observables such as the transmitted charge. By
considering a general class of one-dimensional single-file systems ({meaning
that particle crossings are prohibited}) of interacting hardcore charged
particles, we demonstrate that stringent dynamical constraints give rise to
universal anomalous statistics of cumulative charge currents manifested both on
the timescale characteristic of typical fluctuations and also in the rate
function describing rare events. By computing the full counting statistics of
net transferred charge between two extended subsystems, we establish a number
of unorthodox dynamical properties in an analytic fashion. Most prominently,
typical fluctuations in equilibrium are governed by a universal distribution
that markedly deviates from the expected Gaussian statistics, whereas large
fluctuations are described by an exotic large-deviation rate function featuring
an exceptional triple critical point. Far from equilibrium, competition between
dynamical phases leads to dynamical phase transitions of first and second
order. Despite dynamical criticality, we find the large-deviation rate function
of the joint particle-charge transfer obeys the fluctuation relation.
Curiously, the univariate charge-current rate function experiences a
spontaneous breaking of fluctuation symmetry upon varying the particle and
charge densities in a nonequilibrium initial state. The rich phenomenology of
the outlined dynamical universality is exemplified on an exactly solvable
classical cellular automaton of charged hardcore particles.

<h3>Popcorn Drude weights from quantum symmetry</h3>

Integrable models provide emblematic examples of non-ergodic phenomena. One
of their most distinguished properties are divergent zero-frequency
conductivities signalled by finite Drude weights. Singular conductivities owe
to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that propagate ballistically through
the system without any diffraction. The case of the celebrated quantum
Heisenberg chain, one of the best-studied many-body paradigms, turns out to be
particularly mysterious. About a decade ago, it was found that the spin Drude
weight in the critical phase of the model assumes an extraordinary, nowhere
continuous, dependence on the anisotropy parameter in the shape of a `popcorn
function'. This unprecedented discovery has been afterwards resolved at the
level of the underlying deformed quantum symmetry algebra which helps
explaining the erratic nature of the quasiparticle spectrum at commensurate
values of interaction anisotropy. This work is devoted to the captivating
phenomenon of discontinuous Drude weights, with the aim to give a broader
perspective on the topic by revisiting and reconciling various perspectives
from the previous studies. Moreover, it is argued that such an anomalous
non-ergodic feature is not exclusive to the integrable spin chain but can be
instead expected in a number of other integrable systems that arise from
realizations of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$,
specialized to unimodular values of the quantum deformation parameter $q$. Our
discussion is framed in the context of gapless anisotropic quantum chains of
higher spin and the sine-Gordon quantum field theory in two space-time
dimensions.
