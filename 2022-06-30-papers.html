<h3>Inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle in the presence of magnetic field</h3>

We consider an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle in an athermal
bath. The particle is charged, constrained to move in a two-dimensional
harmonic trap, and a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of
motion. The steady state correlations and the mean square displacement are
studied when the particle is confined as well as when it is set free from the
trap. With the help of both numerical simulation and analytical calculations,
we observe that inertia plays a crucial role in the dynamics in the presence of
a magnetic field. In a highly viscous medium where the inertial effects are
negligible, the magnetic field has no influence on the correlated behaviour of
position as well as velocity. In the time asymptotic limit, the overall
displacement of the confined harmonic particle gets enhanced by the presence of
magnetic field and saturates for a stronger magnetic field. On the other hand,
when the particle is set free, the overall displacement gets suppressed and
approaches zero when strength of the field is very high. Interestingly, it is
seen that in the time asymptotic limit, the confined harmonic particle behaves
like a passive particle and becomes independent of the activity, especially in
the presence of a very strong magnetic field. Similarly, for a free particle
the mean square displacement in the long time limit becomes independent of
activity even for a longer persistence of noise correlation in the dynamics.

<h3>Mechanical Bistability in Kerr-modified Cavity Magnomechanics</h3>

Bistable mechanical vibration is observed in a cavity magnomechanical system,
which consists of a microwave cavity mode, a magnon mode, and a mechanical
vibration mode of a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere. The
bistability manifests itself in both the mechanical frequency and linewidth
under a strong microwave drive field, which simultaneously activates three
different kinds of nonlinearities, namely, magnetostriction, magnon self-Kerr,
and magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearities. The magnon-phonon cross-Kerr
nonlinearity is first predicted and measured in magnomechanics. The system
enters a regime where Kerr-type nonlinearities strongly modify the conventional
cavity magnomechanics that possesses only a dispersive magnomechanical
coupling. Three different kinds of nonlinearities are identified and
distinguished in the experiment. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism for
achieving mechanical bistability by combining magnetostriction and Kerr-type
nonlinearities, and indicates that such Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanics
provides a unique platform for studying many distinct nonlinearities in a
single experiment.
