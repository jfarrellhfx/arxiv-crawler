As a natural van der Waals crystal, {\alpha}-MoO3 has excellent in-plane
hyperbolic properties and essential nanophotonics applications. However, its
actively tunable properties are generally neglected. In this work, we achieved
active modulation of spontaneous emission from a single-layer flat plate using
the rotation method for the first time. Numerical results and theoretical
analysis show that {\alpha}-MoO3 exhibits good tunability when rotated in the
y-z or x-y plane. A modulation factor of more than three orders of magnitude
can be obtained at 634 cm-1. However, when the rotation is in the x-z plane,
the spontaneous emission of the material exhibits strong angle independence.
The theoretical formulation and the physical mechanism analysis explain the
above phenomenon well. In addition, for the semi-infinite {\alpha}-MoO3 flat
structure, we give the distribution of the modulation factor of spontaneous
emission with wavenumber and rotation angle. Finally, we extended the
calculation results from semi-infinite media to finite thickness films. We
obtained the general evolution law of the peak angle of the modulation factor
with thickness, increasing the modulation factor to about 2000. We believe that
the results of this paper can guide the active modulation of spontaneous
emission based on anisotropic materials.
