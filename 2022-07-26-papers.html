<h3>Hybrid quantum nanophotonic devices with color centers in nanodiamonds</h3>

Optically active color centers in nanodiamonds offer unique opportunities for
generating and manipulating quantum states of light. These mechanically,
chemically, and optically robust emitters can be produced in mass quantities,
deterministically manipulated, and integrated with a variety of quantum device
geometries and photonic material platforms. Nanodiamonds with deeply
sub-wavelength sizes coupled to nanophotonic structures feature a giant
enhancement of light-matter interaction, promising high bitrates in quantum
photonic systems. We review the recent advances in controlled techniques for
synthesizing, selecting, and manipulating nanodiamond-based color centers for
their integration with quantum nanophotonic devices.

<h3>Ultra wideband axion search using a Faraday haloscope</h3>

Dark matter is a major constituent of our universe and the axion is a prime
candidate. In this article, it is shown that by using the axion induced
magnetization in a magnetic rod and the Faraday effect, axions in the mass
range $500~\mu$eV to $5000~\mu$eV can be searched for using a single
experimental setup. The magnetic rod is placed inside a high finesse optical
cavity which by confining the light inside it increases the interaction time
and thus effectively lengthens the Faraday active material. This significantly
rotates the plane of polarization of the outgoing light and produces a strong
signal. Detection is carried out by counting photons in the optical domain
using a standard photon counter. An optical interferometric scheme that could
provide spectroscopic information about the axion to be searched is also
proposed.

<h3>Superconductor--Insulator Transition in a non-Fermi Liquid</h3>

We present a model of a strongly correlated system with a non-Fermi liquid
high temperature phase. Its ground state undergoes an insulator to
superconductor quantum phase transition (QPT) as a function of a pairing
interaction strength. Both the insulator and the superconductor are originating
from the same interaction mechanism. The resistivity in the insulating phase
exhibits the activation behavior with the activation energy, which goes to zero
at the QPT. This leads to a wide quantum critical regime with an algebraic
temperature dependence of the resistivity. Upon raising the temperature in the
superconducting phase, the model exhibits a finite temperature phase transition
to a Bose metal phase, which separates the superconductor from the non-Fermi
liquid metal.

<h3>How criticality meets bifurcation in compressive failure of disordered solids</h3>

Continuum mechanics describes compressive failure as a standard bifurcation
in the response of a material to an increasing load: damage, which initially
grows uniformly in the material, localizes within a thin band at failure. Yet,
experiments recording the acoustic activity preceding localization evidence
power-law distributed failure precursors of increasing size, suggesting that
compressive failure is a critical phenomenon. We examine here this apparent
contradiction by probing the spatial organization of the damage activity and
its evolution until localization during compression experiments of 2D cellular
solids. The intermittent damage evolution measured in our experiments is
adequately described by a non-stationary depinning equation derived from damage
mechanics and reminiscent of critical phenomena. In this description,
precursors are damage cascades emerging from the interplay between the
material's disorder and the long-range stress redistributions following
individual damage events. Yet, the divergence of their characteristic size
close to failure, which we observe in our experiments, is not the signature of
a transition towards criticality. Instead, the system remains at a fixed
distance to the critical point at all stages of the damage evolution. The
divergence results from the progressive loss of stability of the material as it
is driven towards localization. Thus, our study shows that compressive failure
is a standard bifurcation for which the material disorder plays a marginal
role. It also shows that precursory activity constitute by-products of the
evolution towards localization and can serve to build a predictive method to
assess the residual lifetime of structures.

<h3>Intermittency, fluctuations and maximal chaos in an emergent universal state of active turbulence</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12227v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12227v1</a>

A hydrodynamic model of active, low Reynolds number suspensions, shows the
emergence of an asymptotic state with a universal spectral scaling and
non-Gaussian (intermittent) fluctuations in the velocity field. Such states
arise when these systems are pushed beyond a critical level of activity and
show features akin to high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We provide
compelling numerical and analytical evidence for the existence of such a
transition at a critical value of activity and further show that the maximally
chaotic states are tied to this transition.

<h3>Optoelectronic control of atomic bistability with graphene</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12134v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12134v1</a>
<br>
<i>Mikkel Have Eriksen, Jakob E. Olsen, Christian Wolff, Joel D. Cox</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the emergence and active control of optical bistability in a
two-level atom near a graphene sheet. Our theory incorporates self-interaction
of the optically-driven atom and its coupling to electromagnetic vacuum modes,
both of which are sensitive to the electrically-tunable interband transition
threshold in graphene. We show that electro-optical bistability and hysteresis
can manifest in the intensity, spectrum, and quantum statistics of the light
emitted by the atom, which undergoes critical slow-down to steady-state. The
optically-driven atom-graphene interaction constitutes a platform for active
control of driven atomic systems in quantum coherent control and atomic
physics.

<h3>Fluctuations of entropy production of a run-and-tumble particle</h3>

Out-of-equilibrium systems continuously generate entropy, with its rate of
production being a fingerprint of non-equilibrium conditions. In small-scale
dissipative systems subject to thermal noise, fluctuations of entropy
production are significant. Hitherto, mean and variance have been abundantly
studied, even if higher moments might be important to fully characterize the
system of interest. Here, we introduce a graphical method to compute any moment
of entropy production for a generic discrete-state system. Then, we focus on a
paradigmatic model of active particles, i.e., run-and-tumble dynamics, which
resembles the motion observed in several microorganisms. Employing our
framework, we compute the first three cumulants of the entropy production for a
discrete version of this model. We also compare our analytical results with
numerical simulations. We find that as the number of states increases, the
distribution of entropy production deviates from a Gaussian. Finally, we extend
our framework to a continuous state-space run-and-tumble model, using an
appropriate scaling of the transition rates. The approach here presented might
help uncover the features of non-equilibrium fluctuations of any current in
biological systems operating out-of-equilibrium.
