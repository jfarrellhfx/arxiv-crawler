Abstract: The viscosity of nanoparticle suspensions is always expected to increase with particle concentration. However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we combined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high P\'eclet numbers (Pe $> 100$). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio $\approx 5.5$. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and promotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous dissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds for both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the molecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in the dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of pure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes significant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These findings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene suspension due only to hydrodynamic effects. Our work has important implications for the design of lubricants, inks, and nanocomposites with tunable viscosity.</p><hr><h2><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17532' target='_blank'>Interfacial instability of confined 3D active droplets</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bennett C. Sessa, Federico Cao, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers, Guillaume Duclos</p><p>arXiv:2506.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities of fluid-fluid interfaces are ubiquitous in passive soft matter. Adding activity to the interface or either fluid can dramatically change the stability of the interface. Using experiment and theory, we investigate the interfacial instability of a deformable 3D active nematic liquid crystal droplet in the isotropic phase surrounded by a passive fluid and confined between two parallel plates. Spontaneous active flows drive the growth of undulations along the active/passive interface, with the mode number of the fastest-growing mode increasing with droplet radius and decreasing with gap height. We apply the lubrication approximation to a minimal nematohydrodynamic model to determine the growth rates of all interfacial modes. The magnitude of the growth rate is determined by the active timescale and the relaxation timescales associated with liquid crystalline order, as well as capillary and viscous stresses. We find multiple points of agreement between experiment and theory, including the shape evolution of individual droplets, the growth rates of unstable modes averaged across many droplets, and the extensional shear flows observed within droplets.</p><hr><h2><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17829' target='_blank'>Non-algebraic first return probability of a stretched random walk near a convex boundary and its effect on adsorption</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil Fedotov, Sergei Nechaev</p><p>arXiv:2506.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $N$-step random walk, stretched in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\sim \exp\left(-{\rm const}\, N^{1/3}\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\frac{L}{a}\gg 1, \frac{R}{a}\gg 1$ conditioned that $\frac{L}{R}=c={\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c > \pi$. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched ("inflated") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.</p><hr><h2><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18551' target='_blank'>Two dimensional Coulomb gas in a non-conservative trap</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> David S. Dean, Rashed Aljasmi, Satya N. Majumdar</p><p>arXiv:2506.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium steady state of a two dimensional Coulomb gas under the action of an anisotropic harmonic trapping potential along with a non-conservative rotational force. In the case without rotation, the equilibrium (zero temperature) steady state has a uniform density supported over a a static elliptical droplet. The addition of a rotational force drives the system into a nonequilibrium steady state where the density is still uniform inside an ellipse, but the ellipse gets tilted by a a fixed angle compared to the non-rotational case. In addition, a nonzero current is generated inside the droplet which run concentrically to the droplet boundary. For large rotational force, the droplet develops a purely circular form. Our results are predicted by a simple hydrodynamic calculation and are confirmed by numerical simulations and provide a full understanding of a novel driven non-equilibrium state in a strongly interacting system.</p><hr><h2><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17920' target='_blank'>Basal layer of granular flow down smooth and rough inclines: kinematics, slip laws and rheology</a></h2><p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teng Wang, Lu Jing, Fiona C.

Abstract: Granular flow down an inclined plane is ubiquitous in geophysical and industrial applications. On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's velocity profile and follows the so-called $\mu(I)$ local rheology. On insufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the bottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is not predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method simulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows down both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a dimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional plane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip regime ($R_a \lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip regime ($R_a \gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip regime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature) of the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip laws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local shear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover, the basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends somewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show that the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\mu(I)$ rheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic theory for granular flows. Our findings can help develop more predictive granular flow models in the future.</p><hr></body></html>
