<h3>Charge fluctuations, hydrodynamics and transport in the square-lattice Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04047v1</a>

Recent experimental results suggest that a particular hydrodynamic theory
describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard
model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge
and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective
hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate
the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of
parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no
effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of
non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is
consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a
Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, and the high-temperature limit for the relation
between the two hydrodynamic model parameters is reproduced; However, the
high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily different. At strong coupling, we
find that a generalized hydrodynamic law is consistent with our quantum Monte
Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results from literature. Most
importantly, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic parameters as well
as the dc resistivity are found to be very similar in the weak and the
strong-coupling regimes.

Coherently controlled thermalization via the quantum SWITCH allows to
activate the state of a work medium and, hence, extract a non-zero work.
However, such thermalization puts certain constraints on extractable work with
respect to the temperatures of the work medium and reservoirs. We analyze these
constraints and the possible ways to go beyond them. We characterize the impact
that entanglement between target and control has on ergotropy and highlight the
role of the coherence present in the state of the work medium. Last but not
least, some of the results are generalized to the case of $N$-switch.

<h3>Anyons, Zitterbewegung and dynamical phase transitions in topologically nontrivial systems</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04270v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04270v1</a>

Nontrivial topology in physical systems is the driving force behind many
phenomena. Notably, phases of matter must be classified in part by their
topological properties. Phases with topological order (TO), such as the
fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE), can support anyonic excitations obeying
fractional statistics with potential application in topological quantum
computing. States lacking intrinsic TO can still be in topological phases
provided certain symmetries are imposed. On their own, these symmetry-protected
phases do not support anyons, but they can still have other interesting
features, such as protected boundary states. In this thesis we present our
research into several nontrivial systems. First, we present the results on
light propagation in the valley modes of inversion-symmetry broken honeycomb
lattices. We find that a rotating spiral pattern, leading to Zitterbewegung,
arises in the intensity profile of the beam as a result of the nontrivial
topology of the valleys. Next, we present the numerical demonstration of
dynamical topological phase transitions driven by nonlinearity of the photonic
medium, which occur in soliton SSH lattices. The phase transitions, marked by
the appearance of topological edge states in the band gap, occur due to the
setup which enables continually changing values of the intracell and intercell
soliton couplings. Finally, we propose a scheme for creating and manipulating
synthetic anyons in a noninteracting system by perturbing it with specially
tailored localized probes. The external probes are needed because
noninteracting systems do not possess the kind of TO required to support
anyons. We start from a 2DEG in a uniform magnetic field (in an integer QHE
state) and introduce thin solenoids carrying a fractional magnetic flux. We
find a suitable ground state and demonstrate the fractional braiding statistics
in the coordinates of the solenoids.

<br>

<br>
We find that, in the presence of weak incoherent effects from surrounding
environments, the zero temperature conductance of nearest neighbour
tight-binding chains exhibits a counter-intuitive power-law growth with system
length at band-edges, indicating superballistic scaling. This fascinating
environment assisted superballistic scaling of conductance occurs over a finite
but extended regime of system lengths. This scaling regime can be
systematically expanded by decreasing the coupling to the surrounding
environments. There is no corresponding analog of this behavior for isolated
systems. This superballistic scaling stems from an intricate interplay of
incoherent effects from surrounding environments and exceptional points of the
system's transfer matrix that occur at every band-edge.

<br>

<br>
<br>
Reducing fluctuations in the output of thermal machines is an important goal
in classical as well as quantum technologies. We show that collective effects
in open quantum systems can be harnessed to develop highly consistent many-body
quantum machines. We consider quantum Otto engines, modeled by $n$ spins
collectively coupled to thermal baths. Our results show that collective effects
can significantly reduce the fluctuations in the output work, quantified by
high reliability ($r$) and low thermodynamic uncertainty. In contrast to
independent engines, we demonstrate a quadratic enhancement of the reliability
$r$ for their collective counterparts. This puts forward the case for realistic
collective quantum thermal machines.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04234v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04234v1</a>
<br>
<i>Mingyuan Zheng, Marco Tarzia, Patrick Charbonneau</i>
<br>
<br>
In systems with frustration, the critical slowdown of the dynamics severely
impedes the numerical study of phase transitions for even the simplest of
lattice models. In order to help sidestep the gelation-like sluggishness, a
clearer understanding of the underlying physics is needed. Here, we first
obtain generic insights into that phenomenon by studying one-dimensional and
Bethe lattice versions of a schematic frustrated model, the axial next-nearest
neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model. Based on these findings, we formulate two cluster
algorithms that speed up the simulations of the ANNNI model on a 2D square
lattice. Although these schemes do not avoid the critical slowdown, speed-ups
of factors up to 40 are achieved in some regimes.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04209v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04209v1</a>
<br>
<i>Austin M. Ferrenti, Vanessa Meschke, Shreenanda Ghosh, Jackson Davis, Natalia Drichko, Eric S. Toberer, Tyrel M. McQueen</i>
<br>
<br>
Corkite, PbFe3(PO4)(SO4)(OH)6, an understudied relative of the jarosite
family of Heisenberg antiferromagnets, has been synthesized and its magnetic
properties characterized for the first time. Relative to natural samples,
synthetic corkite displays signatures in both infrared and Raman spectra of a
more ordered arrangement of polyanion groups about the kagom\'e sublattice that
retains inversion symmetry. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that
dried corkite undergoes a transition to a long-range,
antiferromagnetically-ordered state below TN = 48 K, lower than that observed
in the majority of jarosite phases, and indicative of further spin frustration.
Curie-Weiss fitting of the measured magnetic susceptibility yields an effective
magnetic moment of peff = 6.29(1) muB/Fe^3+ and theta_CW = -526.0(1.1) K,
analogous to that observed in similar high-spin Fe^3+ systems, and indicative
of strong antiferromagnetic coupling. Estimation of the change in magnetic
entropy as a function of temperature from T = 0 K to T = 195 K, dS_mag = 14.86
J/mol_Fe^3+ K, is also in good agreement with the dS_mag = Rln(2S+1) = 14.9
J/mol K expected for a S = 5/2 system. In comparison to the pure jarosites,
where both structure and magnetism remain largely invariant upon a variety of
chemical substitutions, the replacement of one sulfate group per formula unit
with a higher-valent phosphate group applies additional steric and electronic
pressure on the kagom\'e lattice in corkite, further frustrating the magnetic
ground state of the material. Corkite thus represents both an outlier in the
known body of jarosite-type materials, and an illustration of how existing
structures may be further strained in the development of highly frustrated
magnetic systems.

The direct control of magnetic domain patterns on nanometer length and
femtosecond time scales is of great interest, both fundamentally and for
potential applications in spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate how magnetic
domain patterns in a Tm-doped yttrium iron garnet (Tm:YIG) thin film with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be permanently imprinted by the high
intensity photon pulses of a hard x-ray transient grating (XTG). Micromagnetic
simulations provide qualitative understanding of the observed changes in the
orientation of magnetic domains in Tm:YIG and XTG-induced changes. The
presented results offer a route for the effective ultrafast manipulation of
magnetic structures potentially down to a few nanometers.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04199v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04199v1</a>
<br>
<i>Bernd Schmidt, Ji Zeman</i>
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this note is to establish two continuum theories for the
bending and torsion of inextensible rods as $\Gamma$-limits of 3D atomistic
models. In our derivation we study simultaneous limits of vanishing rod
thickness $h$ and interatomic distance $\varepsilon$. First, we set up a novel
theory for ultrathin rods composed of finitely many atomic fibres
($\varepsilon\sim h$), which incorporates surface energy and new discrete terms
in the limiting functional. This can be thought of as a contribution to the
mechanical modelling of nanowires. Second, we treat the case where
$\varepsilon\ll h$ and recover a nonlinear rod model $-$ the modern version of
Kirchhoff's rod theory.

</body><h3>A continuum model for brittle nanowires derived from an atomistic description by $Œì$-convergence</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04195v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04195v1</a>
<br>
<i>Bernd Schmidt, Ji Zeman</i>
<br>
<br>
Starting from a particle system with short-range interactions, we derive a
continuum model for the bending, torsion, and brittle fracture of inextensible
rods moving in three-dimensional space. As the number of particles tends to
infinity, it is assumed that the rod's thickness is of the same order as the
interatomic distance. Fracture energy in the $\Gamma$-limit is expressed by an
implicit cell formula, which covers different modes of fracture, including
(complete) cracks, folds and torsional cracks. Our approach applies e.g. to
atomistic systems with Lennard-Jones-type potentials and is motivated by the
research of ceramic nanowires.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04168v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04168v1</a>
<br>
<i>Siphiwo R. Dlamini, Alex Matos-Abiague</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the effects of tunable magnetic fringe fields
generated by arrays of switchable magnetic junctions (MJs) on the quantum
states of an underlying two-dimensional (2D) system formed in a semiconductor
quantum well. The magnetic landscape generated by the MJ-array can be
reconfigured on the nanometer scale by electrically switching the magnetic
state of individual MJs. The interaction between the spin of the carriers and
the fringe fields generates effective spin-dependent potentials acting like
quantum dots (barriers) for carriers with spin parallel (antiparallel) to the
magnetic texture. The position and depth (height) of the magnetically generated
quantum dots (barriers), as well as the coupling between them, can be tuned by
modulating the magnetic texture through switchings of individual MJs. This
enables the magnetic control, manipulation, and design of quantum states, their
spin, and transport properties.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04167v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04167v1</a>
<br>
<i>G. Dagvadorj, P. Comaron, M. H. Szymanska</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a four-component polariton system in the optical parametric
oscillator regime consisting of exciton/photon and signal/idler modes across
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We show that all four
components share the same BKT critical point, and algebraic decay of spatial
coherence with the same critical exponent. However, while the collective
excitations in different components are strongly locked, both close to and far
from criticality, the spontaneous creation of topological defects in the
vicinity of the phase transition is found to be largely independent of the
inter-component mode locking, and instead strongly dependent on the density
within a given mode. This peculiar characteristic allows us to reveal a novel
state of matter, characterised by configurations of topological defects
proliferating on top of a superfluid with algebraic decay of coherence,
observation of which is demonstrated to be within reach of current experiments.

Applying artificial intelligence to scientific problems (namely AI for
science) is currently under hot debate. However, the scientific problems differ
much from the conventional ones with images, texts, and etc., where new
challenges emerges with the unbalanced scientific data and complicated effects
from the physical setups. In this work, we demonstrate the validity of the deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) on reconstructing the lattice topology
(i.e., spin connectivities) in the presence of strong thermal fluctuations and
unbalanced data. Taking the kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics as an
example, the CNN maps the time-dependent local magnetic momenta (a single-node
feature) evolved from a specific initial configuration (dubbed as an evolution
instance) to the probabilities of the presences of the possible couplings. Our
scheme distinguishes from the previous ones that might require the knowledge on
the node dynamics, the responses from perturbations, or the evaluations of
statistic quantities such as correlations or transfer entropy from many
evolution instances. The fine tuning avoids the "barren plateau" caused by the
strong thermal fluctuations at high temperatures. Accurate reconstructions can
be made where the thermal fluctuations dominate over the correlations and
consequently the statistic methods in general fail. Meanwhile, we unveil the
generalization of CNN on dealing with the instances evolved from the unlearnt
initial spin configurations and those with the unlearnt lattices. We raise an
open question on the learning with unbalanced data in the nearly
"double-exponentially" large sample space.

<br>
<i>Alberto Rosso, James P. Sethna, Matthieu Wyart</i>
<br>
<br>
In this chapter, we discuss avalanches in glasses and disordered systems, and
the macroscopic dynamical behavior that they mediate. We briefly review three
classes of systems where avalanches are observed: depinning transition of
disordered interfaces, yielding of amorphous materials, and the jamming
transition. Without extensive formalism, we discuss results gleaned from
theoretical approaches -- mean-field theory, scaling and exponent relations,
the renormalization group, and a few results from replica theory. We focus both
on the remarkably sophisticated physics of avalanches and on relatively new
approaches to the macroscopic flow behavior exhibited past the
depinning/yielding transition.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04072v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04072v1</a>

<i>Yuval Scher, Ofek Lauber Bonomo, Arnab Pal, Shlomi Reuveni</i>
<br>
<br>
Adsorption is the accumulation of a solute at an interface that is formed
between a solution and an additional gas, liquid, or solid phase. The
macroscopic theory of adsorption dates back more than a century and is now
well-established. Yet, despite recent advancements, a detailed and
self-contained theory of single-particle adsorption is still lacking. Here, we
bridge this gap by developing a microscopic theory of adsorption kinetics, from
which the macroscopic properties follow directly. One of our central
achievements is the derivation of the microsopic version of the seminal
Ward-Tordai relation which connects the surface and subsurface adsorbate
concentrations via a universal equation that holds for arbitrary adsorption
dynamics. Furthermore, we present a microscopic interpretation of the
Ward-Tordai relation which, in turn, allows us to generalize it to arbitrary
dimension, geometry and initial conditions. The power of our approach is
showcased on a set of hitherto unsolved adsorption problems to which we present
exact analytical solutions. The framework developed herein sheds fresh light on
the fundamentals of adsorption kinetics, which opens new research avenues in
surface science with applications to artificial and biological sensing and to
the design of nano-scale devices.

<i>Michael Schler, Thorsten Schmitt, Philipp Werner</i>
<br>
<br>
Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can probe localized excitations at
selected atoms in materials, including particle-hole transitions from valence
to the conduction bands. These transitions are governed by fundamental
properties of the corresponding Bloch wave-functions, including orbital and
magnetic degrees of freedom, and quantum geometric properties such as the Berry
curvature. In particular, orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is closely
linked to the Berry curvature, can exhibit a nontrivial momentum dependence. We
demonstrate how information on such OAM textures can be extracted from the
circular dichroism in RIXS. Based on accurate modeling with first-principles
treatment of the key ingredient -- the light-matter interaction -- we simulate
dichroic RIXS spectra for the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide
MoSe$_2$ and the two-dimensional topological insulator 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$.
Guided by an intuitive picture for the optical selection rules, we discuss how
the momentum-dependent OAM manifests itself in the dichroic RIXS signal if one
controls the momentum transfer. Our calculations are performed for typical
experimental geometries and parameter regimes, and demonstrate the possibility
of observing the predicted circular dichroism in forthcoming experiments.

<br>
<br>
Semiconductor moir\'e heterostructures exhibit rich correlation-induced
phenomena at integer and fractional charge fillings with signatures of emergent
magnetism, Mott insulating states and generalized Wigner crystals probed by
optical spectroscopy of intralayer excitons. However, as the staggered band
alignment in the underlying WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer system separates
photoexcited electrons and holes to form lowest-energy interlayer excitons,
direct access to interactions among correlated many-body charge states and
ground state moir\'e excitons remained elusive. Here, we use MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$
heterostacks with type-I band alignment to probe Coulomb interactions of
elementary charges at integer and fractional filling factors of the periodic
moir\'e lattice with the ground and excited states of moir\'e excitons. By
probing the positive and negative regimes of ambipolar doping, we observe
peculiar asymmetry in the response of moir\'e excitons to electron and hole
doping. Moreover, in addition to the formation of positive and negative moir\'e
trions reminiscent of their canonical counterparts in monolayer MoSe$_2$, we
identify novel many-body states formed between charges at fractional filling
factors and moir\'e excitons. These states exhibit doping-dependent Land\'e
factors as signatures of correlation-induced magnetism at both positive and
negative fractional fillings, identifying MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer as a
unique system for studies of correlated phenomena in ambipolar doping regimes.

<br>
The structure and dynamics of isolated nanosamples in free flight can be
directly visualized via single-shot coherent diffractive imaging using the
intense and short pulses of X-ray free-electron lasers. Wide-angle scattering
images even encode three-dimensional morphological information of the samples,
but the retrieval of this information remains a challenge. Up to now, effective
three-dimensional morphology reconstructions from single shots were only
achieved via fitting with highly constrained models, requiring a priori
knowledge about possible geometrical shapes. Here we present a much more
generic imaging approach. Relying on a model that allows for any sample
morphology described by a convex polyhedron, we reconstruct wide-angle
diffraction patterns from individual silver nanoparticles. In addition to known
structural motives with high symmetries, we retrieve imperfect shapes and
agglomerates which were not accessible previously. Our results open new routes
towards true 3D structure determination of single nanoparticles and,
ultimately, 3D movies of ultrafast nanoscale dynamics.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the magnetic, thermal, and magnetocaloric properties of the
intermetallic HoAl$_{3}$ compounds with two different crystal structures. The
room-temperature equilibrium trigonal phase HoAl$_{3}$ undergoes an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at the Neel temperature $T^{\rm tri}_{\rm N}
=$ 9.8 K. The AFM ordering of the compound is strong against the magnetic
field, so that inverse magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is found even under a
magnetic field change of 0-50 kOe. The high-pressure cubic phase HoAl3,
prepared by a rapid-solidification process, is antiferromagnetically ordered
below $T^{\rm cub}_{\rm N} =$ 15 K. Magnetic and specific heat measurements
reveal that this long-range AFM state becomes unstable as the temperature drops
and then it is replaced by a magnetic glassy state below a spin freezing
temperature $T_{\rm f} =$ 11 K. The successive changes in magnetic state result
in complicated temperature and field dependence of the MCE at low temperatures.
