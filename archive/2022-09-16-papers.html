<h3>Absence of a pressure gap and atomistic mechanism of the oxidation of  pure Co nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06949" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06949</a>
<br>
<i>Jaianth Vijayakumar, Tatiana M. Savchenko, David M. Bracher, Gunnar Lumbeeck, Armand Béché, Jo Verbeeck, Štefan Vajda, Frithjof Nolting, C.A.F. Vaz, Armin Kleibert</i>
<br>
We present a detailed atomistic picture of the oxidation mechanism of Co
nanoparticles and its impact on magnetism by experimentally following the
evolution of the structure, chemical composition, and magnetism of individual,
gas-phase grown Co nanoparticles during controlled oxidation. The early stage
oxidation occurs in a twostep process characterized by (i) the initial
formation of small CoO crystallites randomly distributed across the
nanoparticle surface, until their coalescence leads to structural completion of
the oxide shell and passivation of the metallic core; (ii) progressive
conversion of the CoO shell to Co3O4, accompanied by void formation due to the
nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The Co nanoparticles remain highly reactive toward
oxygen during phase (i), demonstrating the absence of a pressure gap whereby a
low reactivity at low pressures is postulated. Our results provide an important
benchmark for an improved understanding of the magnetism of oxidized cobalt
nanoparticles, with potential implications on their performance in catalytic
reactions.

<h3>Slow dynamics and non-ergodicity of the bosonic quantum East model in  the semiclassical limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06963" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06963</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Geißler, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
We study the unitary dynamics of the bosonic quantum East model, a
kinetically constrained lattice model which generalises the quantum East model
to arbitrary occupation per site. We consider the semiclassical limit of large
(but finite) site occupancy, so that the dynamics are approximated by an
evolution equation of the Gross-Pitaevskii kind. This allows us to numerically
study in detail system sizes of hundreds of sites. Like in the spin-$1/2$ case,
we find two dynamical phases, an active one of fast thermalisation, and an
inactive one of slow relaxation and absence of ergodicity on numerically
accessible timescales. The location of this apparent ergodic to non-ergodic
transition coincides with the localisation transition of the ground state. We
further characterize states which are non-ergodic on all timescales in the
otherwise ergodic regime.

<h3>Active Refrigerators Powered by Inertia</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07227</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas Hecht, Suvendu Mandal, Hartmut Löwen, Benno Liebchen</i>
<br>
We present the operational principle for a refrigerator which uses inertial
effects in active Brownian particles to locally reduce their (kinetic)
temperature by two orders of magnitude below the environmental temperature.
This principle exploits the peculiar but so-far unknown shape of the phase
diagram of inertial active Brownian particles to initiate motility-induced
phase separation in the targeted cooling regime only. Remarkably, active
refrigerators operate without requiring isolating walls opening the route
towards using them to systematically absorb and trap, e.g., toxic substances
from the environment.

<h3>Role of the Berry curvature on BCS-type superconductivity in  two-dimensional materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07287" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07287</a>
<br>
<i>Florian Simon, Louis Pagot, Marc Gabay, Mark O. Goerbig</i>
<br>
We theoretically investigate how the Berry curvature, which arises in
multi-band structures when the electrons can be described by an effective
single-band Hamiltonian, affects the superconducting properties of
two-dimensional electronic systems. Generically the Berry curvature is coupled
to electric fields beyond those created by the periodic crystal potential. A
potential source of such electric fields, which vary slowly on the lattice
scale, is the mutual interaction between the electrons. We show that the Berry
curvature provides additional terms in the Hamiltonian describing interacting
electrons within a single band. When these terms are taken into account in the
framework of the usual BCS weak-coupling treatment of a generic attractive
interaction that allows for the formation of Cooper pairs, the coupling
constant is modified. In pure singlet and triplet superconductors, we find that
the Berry curvature generally lowers the coupling constant and thus the
superconducting gap and the critical temperature as a function of doping. From
an experimental point of view, a measured deviation from the expected BCS
critical temperature upon doping, e.g. in doped two-dimensional
transition-metal dichalcogenides, may unveil the strength of the Berry
curvature.

<h3>Revealing the Superior Electrocatalytic Performance of 2D Monolayer  WSe$_2$ Transition Metal Dichalcogenide for Efficient H$_2$ Evolution  Reaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07337</a>
<br>
<i>Srimanta Pakhira, Vikash Kumar</i>
<br>
H$_2$ evolution reaction (HER) requires an electrocatalyst to reduce the
reaction barriers for the efficient production of H$_2$. Platinum-group metal
(PGM) elements such as Pt, Pd, etc. and their derivatives show excellent
electrocatalytic activity for HER. The high cost and lack of availability of
PGM elements bring constraints over their wide commercial applications, so
discovering noble metal-free electrocatalysts with lower possible reaction
barriers is paramount important. Two-Dimensional Transition Metal
Dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have emerged as a pinnacle group of materials for
many potential applications, including HER. In this work, we have
computationally designed a pristine 2D monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$)
TMD using the first principle-based hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT) to
investigate its structural, electronic properties and the electrocatalytic
performance for HER. The possible Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel reaction
mechanisms for HER at the W-edge of the active site of WSe$_2$ were studied by
using a non-periodic finite molecular cluster model W$_{10}$Se$_{21}$. Our
study shows that the pristine 2D monolayer WSe$_2$ follows either the
Volmer-Heyrovsky or the Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanisms with a single-digit
low reaction barrier about 6.11, 8.41 and 6.61 kcal/mol during the solvent
phase calculations of H-migration, Heyrovsky and Tafel transition (TS) states,
respectively. The lower reaction barriers, high turnover frequency (TOF) ~ 4.24
x $10^6$ sec$^{-1}$ and 8.86 x $10^7$ sec$^{-1}$ during the Heyrovsky and Tafel
reaction steps and the low Tafel slope 29.58 mV.dec$^{-1}$ confirm that the
pristine 2D monolayer WSe$_2$ might be a promising alternative to PGM based
electrocatalyst.

<h3>Interaction effects in a 1D flat band at a topological crystalline step  edge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06837</a>
<br>
<i>Glenn Wagner, Souvik Das, Johannes Jung, Artem Odobesko, Felix Küster, Florian Keller, Jedrzej Korczak, Andrzej Szczerbakow, Tomasz Story, Stuart Parkin, Ronny Thomale, Titus Neupert, Matthias Bode, Paolo Sessi</i>
<br>
Step edges of topological crystalline insulators can be viewed as
predecessors of higher-order topology, as they embody one-dimensional edge
channels embedded in an effective three-dimensional electronic vacuum emanating
from the topological crystalline insulator. Using scanning tunneling microscopy
and spectroscopy we investigate the behaviour of such edge channels in
Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se under doping. Once the energy position of the step edge is
brought close to the Fermi level, we observe the opening of a correlation gap.
The experimental results are rationalized in terms of interaction effects which
are enhanced since the electronic density is collapsed to a one-dimensional
channel. This constitutes a unique system to study how topology and many-body
electronic effects intertwine, which we model theoretically through a
Hartree-Fock analysis.
<br>

<h3>Third-order Hall effect in the surface-states of topological insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06867" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06867</a>
<br>
<i>Tanay Nag, Sanjib Kumar Das, Chuanchang Zeng, Snehasish Nandy</i>
<br>
Time reversal and inversion symmetric materials fail to yield linear and
nonlinear responses since they possess net zero Berry curvature. However,
higher-order Hall response can be generated in these systems upon constraining
the crystalline symmetries. Motivated by the recently discovered third-order
Hall (TOH) response mediated by Berry connection polarizability, namely, the
variation the Berry connection with respect to an applied electric field, here
we investigate the existence of such Hall effect in the surface states of
hexagonal warped topological insulator (e.g., Bi$_2$Te$_3$) under the
application of electric field only. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann
formalism, we investigate the effect of tilt and hexagonal warping on the Berry
connection polarizability tensor and consequently, the TOH effect. We find that
the magnitude of the response increases significantly with increasing the tilt
strength and warping and therefore, they can provide the tunability of this
effect. In addition, we also explore the effect of chemical doping on TOH
response in this system. Interestingly, we show based on the symmetry analysis,
that the TOH can be the leading-order response in this system which can
directly be verified in experiments.

<h3>Kinetic theory and memory effects of homogeneous inelastic granular  gases under nonlinear drag</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06876" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06876</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Megías, Andrés Santos</i>
<br>
We study in this work a dilute granular gas immersed in a thermal bath made
of smaller particles with nonnegligible masses as compared with the granular
ones. The kinetic theory for this system is developed and described by an
Enskog--Fokker--Planck equation for the one-particle velocity distribution
function. Granular particles are assumed to have inelastic and hard
interactions, losing energy in collisions as accounted by a constant
coefficient of normal restitution. The interaction with the thermal bath is
based on a nonlinear drag force plus a white-noise stochastic force. To get
explicit results of the temperature aging and steady states, Maxwellian and
first Sonine approximations are developed. The latter takes into account the
coupling of the excess kurtosis with the temperature. Theoretical predictions
are compared with direct simulation Monte Carlo and event-driven molecular
dynamics simulations. While good results for the granular temperature are
obtained from the Maxwellian approximation, a much better agreement, especially
as inelasticity and drag nonlinearity increase, is found when using the first
Sonine approximation. The latter approximation is, additionally, crucial to
account for memory effects like Mpemba and Kovacs-like ones.

<h3>Revisiting the Monge problem in the Landauer limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06878</a>
<br>
<i>Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Carlos Mejia-Monasterio</i>
<br>
We discuss the Monge problem of mass transportation in the framework of
stochastic thermodynamics and revisit the problem of the Landauer limit for
finite-time thermodynamics, a problem that got the interest of Krzysztof
Gawedzki in the last years. We show that restricted to one dimension, optimal
transportation is efficiently solved numerically by well known methods from
differential equations. We add a brief discussion about the relevance this has
on optimising the processing in modern computers.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Connections between efficient control and spontaneous transitions in an  Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06884</a>
<br>
<i>Miranda D. Louwerse, David A. Sivak</i>
<br>
A system can be driven between metastable configurations by a time-dependent
driving protocol, which uses external control parameters to change the
potential energy of the system. Here we investigate the correspondence between
driving protocols that are designed to minimize work and the spontaneous
transition paths of the system in the absence of driving. We study the
spin-inversion reaction in a 2D Ising model, quantifying the timing of each
spin flip and heat flow to the system during both a minimum-work protocol and a
spontaneous transition. The general order of spin flips during the transition
mechanism is preserved between the processes, despite the coarseness of control
parameters that are unable to reproduce more detailed features of the
spontaneous mechanism. Additionally, external control parameters provide energy
to each system component to compensate changes in internal energy, showing how
control parameters are tuned during a minimum-work protocol to counteract
underlying energetic features. This study supports a correspondence between
minimum-work protocols and spontaneous transition mechanisms.

<h3>Unprotected edge modes in quantum spin Hall insulator candidate  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06912" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06912</a>
<br>
<i>Nguyen Minh Nguyen, Giuseppe Cuono, Rajibul Islam, Carmine Autieri, Timo Hyart, Wojciech Brzezicki</i>
<br>
The experiments in quantum spin Hall insulator candidate materials, such as
HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb heterostructures, indicate that in addition to the
topologically protected helical edge modes these multilayer heterostructures
may also support additional edge states, which can contribute to the scattering
and the transport. We use first-principles calculations to derive an effective
tight-binding model for HgTe/CdTe, HgS/CdTe and InAs/GaSb heterostructures, and
we show that all these materials support additional edge states which are
sensitive to the edge termination. We trace the microscopic origin of these
states back to a minimal model supporting flat bands with a nontrivial quantum
geometry that gives rise to polarization charges at the edges. We show that the
polarization charges transform into the additional edge states when the flat
bands are coupled to each other and to the other states to form the Hamiltonian
describing the full heterostructure. Interestingly, in the HgTe/CdTe quantum
wells the additional edge states are far away from the Fermi level so that they
do not contribute to the transport but in the HgS/CdTe and InAs/GaSb
heterostructures they appear within the bulk energy gap giving rise to the
possibility of multimode edge transport. Finally, we demonstrate that because
these additional edge modes are non-topological it is possible to remove them
from the bulk energy gap by modifying the edge potential for example with the
help of a side gate or chemical doping.

<h3>Conductivity and size quantization effects in semiconductor  $δ$-layer systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06959</a>
<br>
<i>Juan P. Mendez, Denis Mamaluy</i>
<br>
We present an open-system quantum-mechanical 3D real-space study of the
conduction band structure and conductive properties of two semiconductor
systems, interesting for their beyond-Moore and quantum computing applications:
phosphorus $\delta$-layers in silicon and the corresponding $\delta$-layer
tunnel junctions. In order to evaluate size quantization effects on the
conductivity, we consider two principal cases: nanoscale finite-width
structures, used in transistors, and infinitely-wide structures, electrical
properties of which are typically known experimentally. For devices widths
$W<10$~nm, quantization effects are strong and it is shown that the number of
propagating modes determines not only the conductivity, but the distinctive
spatial distribution of the current-carrying electron states. For $W>10$~nm,
the quantization effects practically vanish and the conductivity tends to the
infinitely-wide device values. For tunnel junctions, two distinct conductivity
regimes are predicted due to the strong conduction band quantization.

<h3>Particle-like skyrmions interacting with a funnel obstacle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06961</a>
<br>
<i>Xichao Zhang, Jing Xia, Xiaoxi Liu</i>
<br>
The skyrmion-substrate interaction is an important issue to consider when
studying particle-like skyrmions in nanostructures, which may strongly affect
the skyrmion dynamics and lead to complex dynamic phenomena. Here, we report
the current-driven dynamic behaviors of particle-like skyrmions interacting
with the funnel obstacle in a ferromagnetic layer. We computationally
demonstrate that a funnel obstacle with enhanced perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy can be used to modify the dynamics of skyrmions due to the repulsive
skyrmion-funnel interaction, which could generate several nontrivial effects,
including the compression, clogging, annihilation, guided motion, and capturing
of skyrmions. It is also found that the funnel obstacle can separate an
incoming flow of skyrmions into two asymmetric flows. Moreover, we show that it
is possible to capture skyrmions by the funnel obstacle in both static and
dynamic ways. Our results are useful for understanding the skyrmion dynamics
interacting with the substrate and could provide guidelines for the control of
skyrmion flows in a transmission channel.

<h3>Task-adaptive physical reservoir computing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06962" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06962</a>
<br>
<i>Oscar Lee, Tianyi Wei, Kilian D. Stenning, Jack C. Gartside, Shinichiro Seki, Aisha Aqeel, Christian Back, Yoshinori Tokura, Will R. Branford, Hidekazu Kurebayashi</i>
<br>
Reservoir computing is a neuromorphic architecture that potentially offers
viable solutions to the growing energy costs of machine learning. The majority
of neuromorphic computing is currently software-based, where neural network
properties and performance can be reconfigured to suit different computational
tasks. This critical functionality is missing in ``physical" reservoir
computing schemes that exploit nonlinear and history-dependent memory responses
of physical systems for data processing. Here, we experimentally present a
`task-adaptive' approach to physical reservoir computing, capable of
reconfiguring key reservoir properties (nonlinearity, memory-capacity and
complexity) to optimise computational performance across a broad range of
tasks. As a model case of this, we use the temperature and magnetic-field
controlled spin-wave response of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ that hosts skyrmion, conical
and helical magnetic phases, providing on-demand access to a host of different
physical reservoir responses. We quantify phase-tunable reservoir performance,
characterise their properties and discuss the correlation between these in
physical reservoirs. This task-adaptive approach overcomes key prior
limitations of physical reservoirs, opening opportunities to apply
thermodynamically stable and metastable phase control across a wide variety of
physical reservoir systems.

<h3>Optically probing the asymmetric interlayer coupling in  rhombohedral-stacked MoS2 bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06966" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06966</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Liang, Dongyang Yang, Jingda Wu, Jerry I Dadap, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ziliang Ye</i>

The interlayer coupling is emerging as a new parameter for tuning the
physical properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials. When two
identical semiconductor monolayers are stacked with a twist angle, the periodic
interlayer coupling modulation due to the moir\'e superlattice may endow exotic
physical phenomena, such as moir\'e excitons and correlated electronic phases.
To gain insight into these new phenomena, it is crucial to unveil the
underlying coupling between atomic layers. Recently, the rhombohedral-stacked
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayer has attracted significant
interest because of the emergence of an out-of-plane polarization from
non-ferroelectric monolayer constituents. However, as a key parameter
responsible for the physical properties, the interlayer coupling and its
relationship with ferroelectricity in them remain elusive. Here we probe the
asymmetric interlayer coupling between the conduction band of one layer and the
valence band from the other layer in a 3R-MoS2 bilayer, which can be understood
as a result of a layer-dependent Berry phase winding. By performing optical
spectroscopy in a dual-gated device, we show a type-II band alignment exists at
K points in the 3R-MoS2 bilayer. Furthermore, by unraveling various
contributions to the band offset, we quantitatively determine the asymmetric
interlayer coupling and spontaneous polarization in 3R-MoS2.

<i>Daniel A. Bonilla, Enrique Muñoz</i>
<br>
In this article, we consider a theoretical model for a type I Weyl semimetal,
under the presence of a diluted uniform concentration of torsional
dislocations. By a mathematical analysis for partial wave scattering
(phase-shift) for the T-matrix, we obtain the corresponding retarded and
advanced Green's functions that include the effects of multiple scattering
events with the ensemble of randomly distributed dislocations. Combining this
analysis with the Kubo formalism, and including vertex corrections, we
calculate the electronic conductivity as a function of temperature and
concentration of dislocations. We further evaluate our analytical formulas to
predict the electrical conductivity of several transition metal monopnictides,
i.e. TaAs, TaP, NbAs and NbP.

<br>
We revisit the magnetic properties of the antiferromagnetic Kondo lattice
CeNiAsO by $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Our results
confirm two successive antiferromagnetic transitions of Ce moments at
$T_{N1}=9.0(3)$ K and $T_{N2}=7.0(3)$ K. A Knight shift anomaly, characterized
by the failure of $K(T)-\chi(T)$ scaling, is observed below $T^*\sim15$ K,
which gives a measure of the onset of coherent $c-f$ correlation. This energy
scale is further confirmed by the spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$). The
analysis of spin dynamics also reveals a quasi-two-dimensional character of
spin fluctuations in CeNiAsO. This work paves the way for further $^{75}$As
nuclear magnetic resonance studies under pressure.

<br>
We analyze the classical and quantum dynamics of the driven dissipative
Bose-Hubbard dimer. Under variation of the driving frequency, the classical
system is shown to exhibit a bifurcation to the limit cycle, where its
steady-state solution corresponds to periodic oscillation with the frequency
unrelated to the driving frequency. This bifurcation is shown to lead to a
peculiarity in the stationary single-particle density matrix of the quantum
system. The case of the Bose-Hubbard trimer, where the discussed limit cycle
bifurcates into a chaotic attractor, is briefly discussed.

<br>
We briefly review the recent progress of theories and experiments on
spin-orbital-angular-momentum (SOAM)-coupled quantum gases. The coupling
between the intrinsic degree of freedom of particles and their external orbital
motions widely exists in universe, and leads to a broad variety of fundamental
phenomena both in the classical physics and quantum mechanics. Recent
realization of synthetic SOAM coupling in cold atoms has attracted a great deal
of attention, and stimulates a large amount of considerations on exotic quantum
phases in both Bose and Fermi gases. In this review, we present a basic idea of
engineering SOAM coupling in neutral atoms, starting from a semiclassical
description of atom-light interaction. Unique features of the single-particle
physics in the presence of SOAM coupling are discussed. The intriguing
ground-state quantum phases of weakly interacting Bose gases are introduced,
with emphasis on a so-called angular stripe phase, which has yet been observed
at present. It is demonstrated how to generate a stable giant vortex in a
SOAM-coupled Fermi superfluid. We also discuss topological characters of a
Fermi superfluid in the presence of SOAM coupling. We then introduce the
experimental achievement of SOAM coupling in $^{87}$Rb Bose gases and its first
observation of phase transitions. The most recent development of SOAM-coupled
Bose gases in experiments is also summarized. Regarding the controllability of
ultracold quantum gases, it opens a new era, on the quantum simulation point of
view, to study the fundamental physics resulted from SOAM coupling as well as
newly emergent quantum phases.

<h3>Superuniversality of Anderson localization transitions in disordered  non-Hermitian systems with exceptional points</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07072</a>
<br>
<i>C. Wang, X. R. Wang</i>
<br>
The critical exponents of continuous phase transitions of a Hermitian system
depend on and only on its dimensionality and symmetries. This is the celebrated
notion of the universality of continuous phase transitions. Here we report the
superuniversality notion of Anderson localization transitions in non-Hermitian
two-dimensional (2D) systems with exceptional points in which the critical
exponents do not depend on the symmetries. The Anderson localization
transitions are numerically studied by using the finite-size scaling analysis
of the participation ratios. At the exceptional points of either second-order
or fourth-order, two non-Hermitian systems with different symmetries have the
same critical exponent $\nu\simeq 2$ of correlation lengths. This value differs
from all known 2D disordered Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. In the
symmetry-preserved and symmetry-broken phases, the non-Hermitian models with
time-reversal symmetry and without spin-rotational symmetry (without
time-reversal and spin-rotational symmetries) are in the same universality
class of 2D Hermitian electron systems of Gaussian symplectic (unitary)
ensemble, where $\nu\simeq 2.7$ ($\nu\simeq 2.3$). The universality of the
transition is further confirmed by showing that the critical exponent $\nu$
does not depend on the form of disorders and boundary conditions. Our results
suggest that non-Hermitian systems of different symmetries around their
exceptional points form a superuniversality class.

We discuss an analytical model to calculate the superconducting volume ratio.
Apart from this, our model can also predict the shape of embedded
superconducting domains. We applied our model to calculate the superconducting
volume ratios and shape of domains in (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$, (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$,
YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, $\beta$-(BEDT)TTF$_2$I$_3$ and FeSe. Usually in layered
superconductors resistivity drops anisotropically. Our analysis also explains
that, this behaviour is due to flat or needle shape of the superconducting
samples.

<br>
On-chip demagnetization refrigeration has recently emerged as a powerful tool
for reaching microkelvin electron temperatures in nanoscale structures. The
relative importance of cooling on-chip and off-chip components and the thermal
subsystem dynamics are yet to be analyzed. We study a Coulomb blockade
thermometer with on-chip copper refrigerant both experimentally and
numerically, showing that dynamics in this device are captured by a
first-principles model. Our work shows how to simulate thermal dynamics in
devices down to microkelvin temperatures, and outlines a recipe for a
low-investment platform for quantum technologies and fundamental nanoscience in
this novel temperature range.

<h3>Fermion disorder operator: the hedgehog and the fox of quantum many-body  entanglement</h3>

<br>
As the saying goes ``The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one
big thing'', here we show that the disorder operator is both the fox and the
hedgehog in probing the many aspects of quantum entanglement in fermionic
many-body systems. From both analytical and numerical computations in free and
interacting fermion systems in 1d and 2d, we find the disorder operator and the
entanglement entropy exhibit similar universal scaling behavior, as a function
of the boundary length of the subsystem, but with subtle yet important
differences. In 1D they both follow the $\log{L}$ scaling behavior with the
coefficient determined by the Luttinger parameter for the case of disorder
operator, and the conformal central charge for entanglement entropy. In 2D they
both show the universal $L\log L$ scaling behavior in free and interacting
Fermi liquid phases, with the coefficients depending on the geometry of the
Fermi surfaces. However, at a 2d quantum critical point, extra symmetry
information is needed in the design of the disorder operator to be able to
reveal the critical fluctuations as does in the entanglement entropy. Our
results demonstrate the fermion disorder operator can be used to probe certain
aspects of quantum many-body entanglement related to global symmetry and
provide new tools to explore the still largely unknown territory of highly
entangled fermion quantum matter in 2 or higher dimensions.

<h3>Yttrium incorporation in Cr2AlC: On the metastable phase formation and  decomposition of (Cr,Y)2AlC MAX phase thin films</h3>

<br>
Herein we report on the synthesis of a metastable (Cr,Y)2AlC MAX phase solid
solution by co-sputtering from a composite Cr-Al-C and elemental Y target, at
room temperature, followed by annealing. While direct high-temperature
synthesis resulted in multiphase films, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction
analyses, room temperature depositions, followed by annealing to 760 {\deg}C
led to the formation of phase pure (Cr,Y)2AlC by diffusion. Higher annealing
temperatures caused decomposition of the metastable phase into Cr2AlC, Y5Al3 ,
and Cr-carbides. In contrast to pure Cr2AlC, the Y-containing phase
crystallizes directly in the MAX phase structure instead of first forming a
disordered solid solution. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature was
shown to be Y-content dependent and was increased by ~200 {\deg}C for 5 at.% Y
compared to Cr2AlC. Calculations predicting the metastable phase formation of
(Cr,Y)2AlC and its decomposition are in excellent agreement with the
experimental findings.

<h3>Delocalization and re-entrant localization of flat-band states induced  by an imaginary vector potential in disordered lattice models with flat bands</h3>

<i>Sangbum Kim, Kihong Kim</i>
<br>
We present a numerical study of Anderson localization in disordered
non-Hermitian lattice models with flat bands. Specifically we consider
one-dimensional stub and two-dimensional kagome lattices that have a random
scalar potential and a uniform imaginary vector potential and calculate the
spectra of the complex energy, the participation ratio, and the winding number
as a function of the strength of the imaginary vector potential, $h$. The
flat-band states are found to show a double transition from localized to
delocalized and back to localized states with $h$, in contrast to the
dispersive-band states going through a single delocalization transition. When
$h$ is sufficiently small, all flat-band states are localized. As $h$ increases
above a certain critical value $h_1$, some pair of flat-band states become
delocalized. The participation ratio associated with them increases
substantially and their winding numbers become nonzero. As $h$ increases
further, more and more flat-band states get delocalized until the fraction of
the delocalized states reaches a maximum. For larger $h$ values, a re-entrant
localization takes place and, at another critical value $h_2$, all flat-band
states return to compact localized states with very small participation ratios
and zero winding numbers. This re-entrant localization transition, which is due
to the interplay among disorder, non-Hermiticity, and flat band, is a universal
phenomenon occurring in all models having an imaginary vector potential and a
flat band simultaneously. We explore the spatial characteristics of the
flat-band states by calculating the local density distribution.

<br>
Although the concept of Luttinger liquid (LL) that describes a
one-dimensional (1D) interacting fermion system collapses in higher dimensions,
it has been proposed to be closely related to many mysteries including the
normal state of cuprate superconductor, unconventional metal, and quantum
criticality. Therefore, the generalization of LL model to higher dimensions has
attracted substantial research attention. Here we systematically investigate
the electronic structure of a quasi-2D compound {\eta}-Mo4O11 using
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab-initio
calculation. Remarkably, we reveal a prototypical LL behavior originating from
the crossing quasi-1D chain arrays hidden in the quasi-2D crystal structure.
Our results suggest that {\eta}-Mo4O11 materializes the long sought-after
crossed LL phase, where the orthogonal orbital components significantly reduce
the coupling between intersecting quasi-1D chains and therefore maintain the
essential properties of LL. Our finding not only presents a realization of 2D
LL, but also provides a new angle to understand non-Fermi liquid behaviors in
other 2D and 3D quantum materials.

Disordered elemental semiconductors, most notably a-C and a-Si, are
ubiquitous in a myriad of different applications. These exploit their unique
mechanical and electronic properties. In the past couple of decades, density
functional theory (DFT) and other quantum mechanics-based computational
simulation techniques have been successful at delivering a detailed
understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of crystalline
semiconductors. Unfortunately, the complex structure of disordered
semiconductors sets the time and length scales required for DFT simulation of
these materials out of reach. In recent years, machine learning (ML) approaches
to atomistic modeling have been developed that provide an accurate
approximation of the DFT potential energy surface for a small fraction of the
computational time. These ML approaches have now reached maturity and are
starting to deliver the first conclusive insights into some of the missing
details surrounding the intricate atomic structure of disordered
semiconductors. In this Topical Review we give a brief introduction to ML
atomistic modeling and its application to amorphous semiconductors. We then
take a look at how ML simulations have been used to improve our current
understanding of the atomic structure of a-C and a-Si.

<br>
Single-particle optical trapping interferometry (OTI) allows us to detect the
Brownian motion of a tracer bead immersed in a complex fluid with nanometric
resolution and in the microsecond time-scale. By OTI, we study suspensions
composed of filamentous actin (F-actin), a classic example of a semiflexible
polymer, using two different kind of tracers: chemically-inert melamine resin
and polystyrene depleted particles. One-particle microrheology permits to
investigate the local fluctuations of the polymers in the network, but under
the condition of a previous knowledge of the F-actin characteristic lengths in
relation with the radius of the probes. In this work, we focus on the power-law
behavior of the skeletal thin filament, composed by tropomyosin (Tm) and
troponin (Tn) coupled to F-actin, which has a role in the muscle contraction by
its interaction with myosin. We find that the elastic modulus for the
F-actin/Tm/Tn complex in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$ is constant until the limit
of high frequencies, and that the calculated values of the power-law exponent
are less dispersed than in F-actin alone, which we interpret as a
micro-measurement of the filament stabilization.

We study the motion of single trapped microtracers immersed in F-actin
solutions by optical trapping interferometry in order to clarify the observed
variability of their anomalous power-law exponent. We obtain a local 7/8
exponent only for non-adsorbing polymer at low optical trapping forces, a value
which decreases when increasing the trap stiffness. The velocity
autocorrelation function confirms the complex interplay in the colloid-polymer
system even under the influence of small external forces and shows an
additional constant power-law exponent for the depleted particles.

<i>Hidemaro Suwa, Shang-Shun Zhang, Cristian D. Batista</i>
<br>
We study the BCS-BEC crossover phenomenon of triplet exciton condensation
using a half-filled bilayer Hubbard model. We calculate the dynamical spin
structure factor and the exciton wave function on the phase boundary between
the antiferromagnetically ordered and disordered phases. In the BCS regime, the
formation and condensation of particle-hole bound states, namely excitons,
occur simultaneously at the phase transition point, and the exciton wave
function is extended in real space. In the BEC regime, on the other hand, bound
states are well defined over the whole Brillouin zone also in the disordered
phase, and the size of particle-hole pairs is smaller than a lattice space.
Quantum criticality of charge-spin-orbital entangled states can emerge from
intermediate coupling materials in the crossover regime.

Here, we have grown single crystals of LaTe2-xSbx (x=0 and 0.4) with
continuously adjustable CDW. High-pressure x-ray diffraction show LaTe2 does
not undergo phase transition and keep robust below 40 GPa. In-situ
high-pressure electrical measurements show LaTe2-xSbx undergo
semiconductor-metal-superconductivity transition at 4.6 and 2.5 GPa,
respectively. With the doping of Sb, the highest Tc increases from 4.6 to 6.5
K. Theoretical calculations reveal that the CDW has been completely suppressed
and the calculated Tc is about 2.97 K at 4.5 GPa, consistent with the measured
value. Then, the pressure-induced superconductivity in LaTe2-xSbx can be
explained in the framework of the BCS theory.

<h3>Probabilities of moderately atypical fluctuations of the size of a swarm  of Brownian Bees</h3>

<br>
<i>Pavel Sasorov, Arkady Vilenkin, Naftali R. Smith</i>
<br>
The ``Brownian bees'' model describes an ensemble of $N=$~const independent
branching Brownian particles. The conservation of $N$ is provided by a modified
branching process. When a particle branches into two particles, the particle
which is farthest from the origin is eliminated simultaneously. The spatial
density of the particles is governed by the solution of a free boundary problem
for a reaction-diffusion equation in the limit of $N \gg 1$. At long times, the
particle density approaches a spherically symmetric steady state solution with
a compact support of radius $\bar{\ell}_0$. However, at finite $N$, the radius
of this support, $L$, fluctuates. The variance of these fluctuations appears to
exhibit a logarithmic anomaly [Siboni {\em et al}., Phys. Rev. E. {\bf104},
054131 (2021)]. It is proportional to $N^{-1}\ln N$ at $N\to\infty$. We
investigate here the tails of the probability density function (PDF), $P(L)$,
of the swarm radius, when the absolute value of the radius fluctuation $\Delta
L=L-\bar{\ell}_0$ is sufficiently larger than the typical fluctuations' scale
determined by the variance. For negative deviations the PDF can be obtained in
the framework of the optimal fluctuation method (OFM). This part of the PDF
displays the scaling behavior: $\ln P\propto - N \Delta L^2\, \ln^{-1}(\Delta
L^{-2})$, demonstrating a logarithmic anomaly at small negative $\Delta L$. For
the opposite sign of the fluctuation, $\Delta L > 0$, the PDF can be obtained
with an approximation of a single particle, running away. We find that $\ln P
\propto -N^{1/2}\Delta L$. We consider in this paper only the case, when
$|\Delta L|$ is much less than the typical radius of the swarm at $N\gg 1$.

<br>
We have used nanoelectromechanical resonators to probe superfluid $^4$He at
different temperature regimes, spanning over four orders of magnitude in
damping. These regimes are characterized by the mechanisms which provide the
dominant contributions to damping and the shift of the resonance frequency:
tunneling two level systems at the lowest temperatures, ballistic phonons and
rotons at few hundred mK, and laminar drag in the two-fluid regime below the
superfluid transition temperature as well as in the normal fluid. Immersing the
nanoelectromechanical resonators in fluid increases their effective mass
substantially, decreasing their resonance frequency. Dissipationless superflow
gives rise to a unique possibility to dramatically change the mechanical
resonance frequency in situ, allowing rigorous tests on different damping
models in mechanical resonators. We apply this method to characterize tunneling
two-level system losses and magnetomotive damping in the devices.

<br>
Charge noise in the host semiconductor degrades the performance of
spin-qubits and poses an obstacle to control large quantum processors. However,
it is challenging to engineer the heterogeneous material stack of gate-defined
quantum dots to improve charge noise systematically. Here, we address the
semiconductor-dielectric interface and the buried quantum well of a
$^{28}$Si/SiGe heterostructure and show the connection between charge noise,
measured locally in quantum dots, and global disorder in the host
semiconductor, measured with macroscopic Hall bars. In 5 nm thick $^{28}$Si
quantum wells, we find that improvements in the scattering properties and
uniformity of the two-dimensional electron gas over a 100 mm wafer correspond
to a significant reduction in charge noise, with a minimum value of
0.29$\pm$0.02 $\mu$eV/sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz averaged over several quantum dots. We
extrapolate the measured charge noise to simulated dephasing times to cz-gate
fidelities that improve nearly one order of magnitude. These results point to a
clean and quiet crystalline environment for integrating long-lived and
high-fidelity spin qubits into a larger system.

<br>
Inspired by the physics of rare earth nickelates, we study the photoemission
(PES) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of a correlated
electron system with two types of insulating sublattices. Sublattice A is
characterized by a hybridization gap and a low-spin state, while sublattice B
features a Mott gap and a local magnetic moment. We show how the coupling of
these two qualitatively different insulating states affects the dynamics of
photo-induced charge carriers and how the nonequilibrium states manifest
themselves in the PES and RIXS signals. In particular, we find that charge
carriers created on the B sublattice migrate to the A sublattice, where they
contribute to the creation of in-gap states in the PES signal, and to
characteristic peaks in the nonequilibrium RIXS spectrum. While the
contributions from the two sublattices cannot be easily distinguished in the
local photoemission spectrum, the weights of the RIXS signals in the
two-dimensional $\omega_\text{in}$-$\omega_\text{out}$ space provide
information on the local state evolution on both sublattices.

The interface between magnetic material and superconductors has long been
predicted to host unconventional superconductivity, such as spin-triplet
pairing and topological nontrivial pairing state, particularly when
spin-orbital coupling (SOC) is incorporated. To identify these novel pairing
states, fabricating homogenous heterostructures which contain such various
properties are preferred, but often challenging. Here we synthesized a
tri-layer type van-der Waals heterostructure of MnTe/Bi2Te3/Fe(Te, Se), which
combined s-wave superconductivity, thickness dependent magnetism and strong
SOC. Via low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we observed
robust zero-energy states with notably nontrivial properties and an enhanced
superconducting gap size on single unit-cell (UC) MnTe surface. In contrast, no
zero-energy state was observed on 2UC MnTe. First-principle calculations
further suggest the 1UC MnTe has large interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) and a frustrated AFM state, which could promote non-collinear
spin textures. It thus provides a promising platform for exploring topological
nontrivial superconductivity.

Morphogen gradients play an essential role in the spatial regulation of cell
patterning during early development. The classical mechanism of morphogen
gradient formation involves the diffusion of morphogens away from a localized
source combined with some form of bulk absorption. Morphogen gradient formation
plays a crucial role during early development, whereby a spatially varying
concentration of morphogen protein drives a corresponding spatial variation in
gene expression during embryogenesis. In most models, the absorption rate is
taken to be a constant multiple of the local concentration. In this paper, we
explore a more general class of diffusion-based model in which absorption is
formulated probabilistically in terms of a stopping time condition. Absorption
of each particle occurs when its time spent within the bulk domain (occupation
time) exceeds a randomly distributed threshold $a$; the classical model with a
constant rate of absorption is recovered by taking the threshold distribution
$\Psi(a)=\e^{-\kappa_0 a}$. We explore how the choice of $\Psi(a)$ affects the
steady-state concentration gradient, and the relaxation to steady-state as
determined by the accumulation time. In particular, we show that the more
general model can generate similar concentration profiles to the classical
case, while significantly reducing the accumulation time.

<br>
In this paper we extend the encounter-based model of diffusion-mediated
surface absorption to the case of an unbiased run-and-tumble particle (RTP)
confined to a finite interval $[0,L]$. The encounter-based formalism is
motivated by the observation that various surface-based reactions are better
modeled in terms of a reactivity that is a function of the amount of time that
a particle spends in a neighborhood of an absorbing surface, which is specified
by a functional known as the boundary local time. The effects of surface
reactions are taken into account by identifying the first passage time (FPT)
for absorption with the event that the local time crosses some random threshold
$\widehat{\ell}$. In the case of a Brownian particle, taking $\Psi(\ell)\equiv
\P[\widehat{\ell}>\ell]$ to be an exponential distribution,
$\Psi[\ell]=\e^{-\kappa_0\ell}$, is equivalent to imposing a Robin boundary
condition with a constant rate of absorption $\kappa_0$. One major difference
in the encounter-based model of RTP surface absorption is that it involves a
weighted boundary local time that only accumulates when the RTP is in the
velocity state moving away rather than towards the boundary. Given this
modification, we show that in the case of an exponential distribution
$\Psi(\ell)$ we recover the RTP analog of the Robin boundary condition. This
allows us to solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for the joint probability
density for particle position and the local time, and thus incorporate more
general models of absorption based on non-exponential distributions
$\Psi(\ell)$. We illustrate the theory by calculating the mean FPT (MFPT) for
absorption at $x=L$ given a totally reflecting boundary at $x=0$. We also
determine the splitting probability for absorption at $x=L$ when the boundary
at $x=0$ is totally absorbing.

<br>
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have drawn more and more attention from material
scientists and demonstrated a high capacity to establish connections between
the structure and properties. However, with only unrelaxed structures provided
as input, few GNN models can predict the thermodynamic properties of relaxed
configurations with an acceptable level of error. In this work, we develop a
multi-task (MT) architecture based on DimeNet++ and mixture density networks to
improve the performance of such task. Taking CO adsorption on Cu-based
single-atom alloy catalysts as an illustration, we show that our method can
reliably estimate CO adsorption energy with a mean absolute error of 0.087 eV
from the initial CO adsorption structures without costly first-principles
calculations. Further, compared to other state-of-the-art GNN methods, our
model exhibits improved generalization ability when predicting catalytic
performance of out-of-domain configurations, built with either unseen substrate
surfaces or doping species. We show that the proposed MT GNN strategy can
facilitate catalyst discovery.

<br>
The perovskite-type iron oxide Sr$_{2/3}$La$_{1/3}$FeO$_3$ is known to show
characteristic spin-charge ordering (SCO), where sixfold collinear spin
ordering and threefold charge ordering are coupled with each other. Here, we
report the discovery of a spin-charge decoupling and an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
state competing with the SCO phase in perovskites
(Sr$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$)$_{2/3}$La$_{1/3}$FeO$_3$. By comprehensive measurements
including neutron diffraction, M$\"{o}$ssbauer spectroscopy, and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy, we found that the isovalent Ba$^{2+}$ substitution
systematically reduces the critical temperature of the SCO phase and
additionally yields the spin-charge decoupling in $x$ > 0.75. Whereas the
ground state remains in the SCO phase in the whole $x$ region, an unexpected
G-type AFM phase with incoherent charge ordering or charge fluctuation appears
as the high-temperature phase in the range of $x$ > 0.75. Reflecting the
competing nature between them, the G-type AFM phase partially exists as a
metastable state in the SCO phase at low temperatures. We discuss the origin of
the spin-charge decoupling and the emergence of the G-type AFM phase with
charge fluctuation in terms of the bandwidth reduction by the Ba substitution.

<h3>Structure of the normal state and origin of Schottky anomaly in the  correlated heavy fermion superconductor UTe2</h3>

<br>
The newly discovered UTe2 superconductor is regarded as a heavy fermion
mixed-valence system with very peculiar properties within the normal and
superconducting states. It shows no signs of magnetic order but strong
anisotropy of a magnetic susceptibility and a superconducting critical field.
In addition to the heavy fermion-like behavior in the normal state, it exhibits
also a distinctive Schottky-type anomaly at about 12 K and a characteristic
excitations gap ~35-40 K. Here we show, by virtue of dynamical mean-field
theory calculations with a quasi-atomic treatment of electron correlations,
that ab-initio derived crystal-field splitting of the 5f2 ionic configuration
yields an agreement with these experimental observations. We analyze the
symmetry of magnetic and multipolar moment fluctuations that might lead to the
superconducting pairing at low temperatures. A close analogy of the normal
paramagnetic state of UTe2 to that of URu2Si2 in the Kondo arrest scenario is
revealed.

Recently, 2D JTMDs with asymmetric electronic structures are inviting an
intense research interest in modern science and technology. Using the first
principles-based periodic hybrid dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory
(DFT-D) method, we have investigated the equilibrium structure, geometry, and
electronic properties of the 2D monolayer MoSSe JTMD with the electrocatalytic
activities for the H2 evolution reaction (HER). We have performed non-periodic
quantum mechanical DFT computations to find out the most favorable HER pathway
on the exposed surfaces of the 2D Janus MoSSe material i.e., on the Mo-edges
and S- or Se-edges. To explore the electrocatalytic HER mechanism, reaction
pathways and barriers, we have considered a cluster model system Mo10S12Se9 to
illustrate the Mo-edges and S- or Se-edges of the 2D monolayer MoSSe material.
The present study reveals that the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction mechanism is
thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway to evolute H2 at the Se-terminated
Mo-edges. It was found that the change of free energy barrier during the
Heyrovsky reaction at the Se-terminated Mo-edges is about 3.93-7.10 kcal.mol-1
(in both the gas and the solvent phases), indicating an exceptional
electrocatalyst for HER with the lowest activation barriers. This study showed
that the Tafel slope (m) is lower in the case of 2D Janus MoSSe material due to
the overlap of the s-orbital of the hydrogen and d-orbitals of the Mo atoms
appeared in the HOMO and LUMO transition state TS1 of the H-migration reaction
step. The better stabilization of the atomic orbitals in the HER rate-limiting
step i.e., H-migration TS1 reaction step (in the solvent phase) is a key for
reducing the reaction barrier, thus the overall catalysis indicating a better
electrocatalytic performance for H2 evolution.

<br>
The discovery of multiple electronic orders in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5
(A = K, Rb, Cs) provides a promising platform for exploring unprecedented
emergent physics. Under moderate pressure (< 2.2 GPa), the triple-Q charge
density wave (CDW) order is monotonically suppressed by pressure, while the
superconductivity displays a two-dome-like behavior, suggesting an unusual
interplay between superconductivity and CDW order. Given that time-reversal
symmetry breaking and electronic nematicity have been revealed inside the
triple-Q CDW phase, understanding this CDW order and its interplay with
superconductivity becomes one of the core questions in AV3Sb5. Here, we report
the evolution of CDW and superconductivity with pressure in CsV3Sb5 by 51V
nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. An emergent CDW phase, ascribed to a
possible stripe-like CDW order with a unidirectional 4a0 modulation, is
observed between Pc1 ~ 0.58 GPa and Pc2 ~ 2.0 GPa, which explains the
two-dome-like superconducting behavior under pressure. Furthermore, the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation measurement reveals evidence for pressure-independent
charge fluctuations above the CDW transition temperature and unconventional
superconducting pairing above Pc2. Our results not only shed new light on the
interplay of superconductivity and CDW but also reveal novel electronic
correlation effects in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5.

We study Multiple Andreev Reflections in long diffusive
superconductor(S)-normal metal(N)-superconductor junctions with
low-transparency interfaces. Assuming strong thermalization in the weak link we
calculate the current-voltage dependence $I(V)$. At intermediate temperatures,
$E_\mathrm{Th}\ll T\ll\Delta$, the current is dominated by noncoherent multiple
Andreev reflections and is obtained analytically. The results are generalized
to a ferromagnetic junction. We find that the exchange field produces a
non-trivial splitting of the subharmonic gap structure. This effect relies on
thermalization and vanishes in SFS junctions with no energy relaxation in the
weak link.

Studying strong electron correlations has been an essential driving force for
pushing the frontiers of condensed matter physics. In particular, in the
vicinity of correlation-driven quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum
critical fluctuations of multiple degrees of freedom facilitate exotic
many-body states and quantum critical behaviors beyond Landau's framework.
Recently, moir\'e heterostructures of van der Waals materials have been
demonstrated as a highly tunable quantum platform for exploring fascinating
strongly correlated quantum physics. Here, we report the observation of tunable
quantum criticalities in an experimental simulator of extended Hubbard model
with spin-valley isospins arising in chiral-stacked twisted double bilayer
graphene. Scaling analysis shows a quantum two-stage criticality manifesting
two distinct quantum critical points as the generalized Wigner crystal transits
to a Fermi liquid by varying the displacement field, suggesting the emergence
of a critical intermediate phase. The quantum two-stage criticality evolves
into a quantum pseudo criticality as a high parallel magnetic field is applied.
In such pseudo criticality, we find that the quantum critical scaling is only
valid above a critical temperature, indicating a weak first-order QPT therein.
Our results demonstrate a highly tunable solid-state simulator with intricate
interplay of multiple degrees of freedom for exploring exotic quantum critical
states and behaviors.

<h3>Quantum Mechanical Comparison between Lithiated and Sodiated Silicon  Nanowires</h3>

<br>
This computational research study will compare the specific charge capacity
(SCC) between lithium ions inserted into crystallize silicon (c-Si) nanowires
versus sodium ions inserted into amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanowires. It will be
demonstrated that the potential energy V(r) within the lithium-silicon nanowire
supports a coherent energy state model with discrete electron particles while
the sodium-silicon nanowire potential energy will be discovered to be
essentially zero and thus the electron current that travels through the
sodiated silicon nanowire will be modeled as free electron with wave-like
characteristics. This is due to the vast differences in the electric fields of
the lithiated and sodiated silicon nanowires where the electric fields are of
the order of 10^(+10)V/m and 10^(-15) V/m respectively. The main reason for the
great disparity in electric fields are due to the present of optical
amplification within lithium ions and the absence of this process within sodium
ions. It will be shown that optical amplification develops coherent optical
interactions which is the primary reason for the surge of specific charge
capacity in the lithiated silicon nanowire. Conversely, the lack of optical
amplification is the reason for the incoherent optical interactions within
sodium ions which is the reason for the low presence of SCC in sodiated silicon
nanowires.

<h3>Phenomenological formula for Quantum Hall resistivity based on the  Riemann zeta function</h3>

<br>
<i>André LeClair</i>
<br>
We propose a formula constructed out of elementary functions that captures
many of the detailed features of the transverse resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ for the
integer quantum Hall effect. It is merely a phenomenological formula in the
sense that it is not based on any transport calculation for a specific class of
physical models involving electrons in a disordered landscape, thus, whether a
physical model exists which realizes this resistivity remains an open question.
Nevertheless, since the formula involves the Riemann zeta function and its
non-trivial zeros play a central role, it is amusing to consider the
implications of the Riemann Hypothesis in light of it.

<h3>Imaging boundary magnetization of antiferromagnetic domains in epitaxial  films of magnetoelectric Cr2O3 via scanning diamond magnetic probe microscopy</h3>

<br>
We report direct imaging of boundary magnetization associated with
antiferromagnetic domains in magnetoelectric epitaxial Cr2O3 thin films using
diamond nitrogen vacancy microscopy. We found a correlation between magnetic
domain size and structural grain size which we associate with the domain
formation process. We performed field cooling, i.e., cooling from above to
below the N\'eel temperature in the presence of magnetic field, which resulted
in the selection of one of the two otherwise degenerate 1800 domains. Lifting
of such a degeneracy is achievable with a magnetic field alone due to the
Zeeman energy of a weak parasitic magnetic moment in Cr2O3 films that
originates from defects and the imbalance of the boundary magnetization of
opposing interfaces. This boundary magnetization couples to the
antiferromagnetic order parameter enabling selection of its orientation.
Microstructuring the Cr2O3 film with mesa structures revealed reversible edge
magnetic states with the direction of magnetic field during field cooling.

<i>Amit Gupta</i>
<br>
We calculate the optical conductivity of type-I and type-II multi-Weyl
semimetals(m-WSMs) in time-reversal(TR) broken case at finite doping. It is
found that both longitudinal and Hall conductivities are renormalized by
J(monopole charge) perpendicular to Weyl nodes separation and longitudal
conductivity along nodes has non-trivial dependence on J. The Kerr rotations in
thin films and bulk have different dependence on system parameters. The Kerr
rotation in ultra-thin films is independent of monopole charge J and depends
only on Fermi velocity v F while in bulk it dependent on monopole charge J,
Fermi velocity and material parameters.

<h3>Solid-state $S=1$ spin centers with zero-field splitting as quantum  simulators for $S=1/2$ critical behavior</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07516</a>
<br>
<i>Troy Losey, Denis R. Candido, Y. Meurice, M. E. Flatté, S.-W. Tsai, Jin Zhang</i>
<br>
In this work we propose a novel solid-state platform for creating quantum
simulators based on implanted $S=1$ spin centers in semiconductors. We show
that under the presence of an external magnetic field, an array of $S=1$ spin
centers interacting through magnetic dipole-dipole interaction can be mapped
into an effective spin-half system equivalent to the XYZ model in an external
field. Interestingly, this system shows a wide range of phases and critical
behaviors that can be obtained by changing both the magnetic field and the
orientational displacement of the spin centers with respect to their main
symmetry axis. Notably, our model contains a line where the system is in a
critical floating phase that terminates at a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition point and a Pokrovsky-Talapov transition point. It can also be tuned
between an isotropic Heisenberg point and a transverse Ising universality
class. We propose this system as the first quantum simulator for the floating
phase with spin-centers in solid-state materials.
