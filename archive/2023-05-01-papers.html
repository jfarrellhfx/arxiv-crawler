Fractonic superfluids are exotic phases of matter in which bosons are subject
to mobility constraints, resulting in features beyond those of conventional
superfluids. These exotic phases arise from the spontaneous breaking of
higher-rank symmetry (HRS) in many-body systems with higher-moment
conservation, such as dipoles, quadrupoles, and angular moments. The aim of
this paper is to introduce exciting developments on the theory of spontaneous
symmetry breaking in such systems, which we refer to as ``many-fracton
systems''. More specifically, we introduce exciting progress on general aspects
of HRS, minimal model construction, realization of symmetry-breaking ground
states, order parameter, off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO), Noether
currents with continuity equations, Gross-Pitaevskii equations, quantum
fluctuations, Goldstone modes, specific heat, generalized Mermin-Wagner
theorem, critical current, Landau criterion, symmetry defects, and
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)-like physics, hydrodynamics, and lattice model
realization. This paper is concluded with several future directions.

<h3>Dissipative Boundary State Preparation</h3>

We devise a generic and experimentally accessible recipe to prepare boundary
states of topological or non-topological quantum systems through an interplay
between coherent Hamiltonian dynamics and local dissipation. Intuitively, our
recipe harnesses the spatial structure of boundary states which vanish on
sublattices where losses are suitably engineered. This yields unique
non-trivial steady states that populate the targeted boundary states with
infinite life times while all other states are exponentially damped in time.
Remarkably, applying loss only at one boundary can yield a unique steady state
localized at the very same boundary. We detail our construction and rigorously
derive full Liouvillian spectra and dissipative gaps in the presence of a
spectral mirror symmetry for a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and a
two-dimensional Chern insulator. We outline how our recipe extends to generic
non-interacting systems.

TaTe$_4$ is a quasi-1D tetrachalcogenide that exhibits a CDW instability
caused by a periodic lattice distortion. Recently, pressure-induced
superconductivity has been achieved in this compound, revealing a competition
between these different ground states and making TaTe$_4$ very interesting for
fundamental studies. Although TaTe$_4$ exhibits CDW ordering below 475 K,
transport experiments have reported metallic behavior with a resistivity
plateau at temperatures lower than 10 K. In this paper, we study the electronic
structure of TaTe$_4$ using a combination of high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional calculations. Our results
reveal the existence of the long-sought metallic states. These states exhibit
mixed dimensionality, while some of them might have potential topological
properties.

<h3>Persistent dynamic magnetic state in artificial honeycomb spin ice</h3>

Topological magnetic charges, arising due to the non-vanishing magnetic flux
on spin ice vertices, serve as the origin of magnetic monopoles that traverse
the underlying lattice effortlessly. Unlike spin ice materials of atomic
origin, the dynamic state in artificial honeycomb spin ice is conventionally
described in terms of finite size domain wall kinetics that require magnetic
field or current application. Contrary to this common understanding, here we
show that thermally tunable artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice manifests a
perpetual dynamic state due to self-propelled magnetic charge defect relaxation
in the absence of any external tuning agent. Quantitative investigation of
magnetic charge defect dynamics using neutron spin echo spectroscopy reveals
sub-ns relaxation times that are comparable to monopole's relaxation in bulk
spin ices. Most importantly, the kinetic process remains unabated at low
temperature where thermal fluctuation is negligible. This suggests that dynamic
phenomena in honeycomb spin ice are mediated by quasi-particle type entities,
also confirmed by quantum Monte-Carlo simulations that replicate the kinetic
behavior. Our research unveils a new `macroscopic' magnetic particle that
shares many known traits of quantum particles, namely magnetic monopole and
magnon.

Nitride perovskites are an emerging class of materials that have been
predicted to display a range of interesting physics and functional properties,
but they are under-explored due to the difficulty of synthesizing oxygen-free
nitrides. LaWN3, recently reported as the first oxygen-free nitride perovskite,
exhibited polar symmetry and a large piezoelectric coefficient. However, the
predicted ferroelectric switching was hindered by large leakage current, which
motivates better understanding of its electronic structure and optical
properties. Here, we study the structure and optoelectronic properties of thin
film LaWN3 in greater detail, employing combinatorial techniques to correlate
these properties with cation stoichiometry. We report a two-step synthesis that
utilizes a more common RF substrate bias instead of a nitrogen plasma source,
yielding nanocrystalline films that are crystallized by ex-situ annealing. We
investigate the structure and composition of these films, finding
polycrystalline La-rich and highly textured W-rich films. The optical
absorption onset and temperature- and magnetic field-dependent resistivity are
consistent with semiconducting behavior and are highly sensitive to cation
stoichiometry, which may be related to amorphous impurities: metallic W or WNx
in W-rich samples and insulating La2O3 in La-rich samples. The fractional
magnetoresistance is linear and small, consistent with defect scattering, and a
W-rich sample has n-type carriers with high densities and low mobilities. We
demonstrate a photoresponse in LaWN3: the resistivity of a La-rich sample is
enhanced by 28% at low temperature, likely due to a defect trapping mechanism.
The physical properties of LaWN3 are highly sensitive to cation stoichiometry,
like many oxide perovskites, which therefore calls for precise composition
control to utilize the interesting properties observed in this nitride
perovskite.

<h3>Lattice dynamics and ferroelectric properties of the nitride perovskite  ${\mathrm{LaWN}}_{3}$</h3>

<br>
Using first-principles calculations we examine the crystal structures and
phase transitions of nitride perovskite LaWN$_3$. Lattice dynamics calculations
indicate that the ground-state structure belongs to space group $R3c$. Two
competitive phase transition pathways are identified which are characterized by
symmetry-adapted distortion modes. The results suggest that $R3c$ LaWN$_3$
should be an excellent ferroelectric semiconductor: its large spontaneous
polarization of around 61 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ is comparable to that of PbTiO$_3$, and
its band gap is about 1.72 eV. Ferroelectricity is found to result from the
\emph{B}-site instability driven by hybridization between W-5$d$ and N-2$p$
orbitals. These properties make LaWN$_3$ an attractive candidate material for
use in ferroelectric memory devices and photovoltaic cells.

<h3>Classification of Classical Spin Liquids: Typology and Resulting  Landscape</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00155" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00155</a>

<i>Han Yan, Owen Benton, Roderich Moessner, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</i>
<br>

Classical spin liquids (CSL) lack long-range magnetic order and are
characterized by an extensive ground state degeneracy. We propose a
classification scheme of CSLs based on the structure of the flat bands of their
Hamiltonians. Depending on absence or presence of the gap from the flat band,
the CSL are classified as algebraic or fragile topological, respectively. Each
category is further classified: the algebraic case by the nature of the
emergent Gauss's law at the gap-closing point(s), and the fragile topological
case by the homotopy of the eigenvector winding around the Brillouin zone.
Previously identified instances of CSLs fit snugly into our scheme, which finds
a landscape where algebraic CSLs are located at transitions between \fragile
topological ones. It also allows us to present a new, simple family of models
illustrating that landscape, which hosts both fragile topological and algebraic
CSLs, as well as transitions between them.

<h3>Dynamical relaxation behaviors of a critical quench</h3>

We study the universal dynamical relaxation behaviors of a quantum XY chain
following a quench, paying special attention to the case that the prequenched
Hamiltonian, or the postquenched Hamiltonian, or both of them are at critical
points of equilibrium quantum phase transitions. In such ``critical quench", we
find very interesting real-time dynamical scaling behaviors and the crossover
phenomena between them. For a quench from a noncritical point to a critical
point, we find that, compared to the noncritical quench, the universal
power-law scaling behavior does not change; however, there may be a crossover
between the exponential decaying behavior and the power-law scaling. For a
quench from a critical point to a noncritical point, the power-law scaling
behaviors $t^{-3/2}$ and $t^{-3/4}$ in the noncritical quenches may be changed
to $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-1/2}$, respectively. If the prequenched Hamiltonian is set
to be a point that is close to but not exactly at a critical point, we find
interesting crossover phenomena between different power-law scaling behaviors.
We also study the quench from the vicinity of a multicritical point, we find
crossover behaviors that are induced by a different mechanism, and new
crossover exponent is found. All the results are related to the gap-closing
properties of the energy spectrum of the critical points.

<h3>Structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CrTe2</h3>

Two-dimensional chromium ditelluride (CrTe2) is a promising ferromagnetic
layered material that exhibits long-range ferromagnetic ordering in the
monolayer limit. The formation energies of the different possible structural
phases (1T, 1H, 2H) calculated from density functional theory (DFT) show that
the 1T phase is the ground state, and the energetic transition barriers between
the phases, calculated by the nudged elastic band method, are large, on the
order of 0.5 eV. The self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction parameters are
calculated for all the phases of CrTe$_2$. The calculated magnetic moment of
1T-CrTe$_2$ with $\geq 2$ layers lies in the plane, whereas the magnetic moment
of a monolayer is out-of-plane. Band filling and tensile bi-axial strain cause
the magnetic moment of a monolayer to switch from out-of-plane to in-plane, and
compressive bi-axial strain in a bilayer causes the magnetic moment to switch
from in-plane to out-of-plane. The magnetic anisotropy is shown to originate
from the large spin orbit coupling (SOC) of the Te atoms and the anisotropy of
the exchange coupling constants $J_{xy}$ and $J_z$ in an XXZ type Hamiltonian.
Renormalized spin wave theory using experimental values for the magnetic
anisotropy energy and Curie temperatures provides a range of values for the
nearest neighbor exchange coupling.

To fully explore exciton-based applications and improve their performance, it
is essential to understand the exciton behavior in anisotropic materials. Here,
we investigate the optical properties of anisotropic excitons in GeS
encapsulated by h-BN, using different approaches that combine polarization- and
temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements, \textit{ab initio}
calculations, and effective mass approximation (EMA). Using the Bethe-Salpeter
Equation (BSE) method, we found that the optical absorption spectra in GeS are
significantly affected by the Coulomb interaction included in the BSE method,
which shows the importance of excitonic effects besides it exhibits a
significant dependence on the direction of polarization, revealing the
anisotropic nature of bulk GeS. Combining \textit{ab initio} calculations and
EMA methods, we investigate the quasi-hydrogenic exciton states and oscillator
strength (OS) of GeS along the zigzag and armchair axes. We found that the
anisotropy induces lifting of the degeneracy and mixing of the excitonic states
in GeS, which results in highly nonhydrogenic features. Very good agreement
with the experiment is observed.

<h3>Electrical Tuning of Terahertz Plasmonic Crystal Phases</h3>

We present an extensive study of resonant two-dimensional (2D) plasmon
excitations in grating-gated quantum well heterostructures, which enable an
electrical control of periodic charge carrier density profile. Our study
combines theoretical and experimental investigations of AlGaN/GaN grating-gate
structures and reveals that all terahertz (THz) plasmonic resonances in these
structures can be explained only within the framework of the plasmonic crystal
model. We identify two different plasmonic crystal phases. The first is the
delocalized phase, where THz radiation interacts with the entire grating-gate
structure that is realized at a weakly modulated 2D electron gas (2DEG) regime.
In the second, the localized phase, THz radiation interacts only with the
ungated portions of the structure. This phase is achieved by fully depleting
the gated regions, resulting in strong modulation. By gate-controlling of the
modulation degree, we observe a continuous transition between these phases. We
also discovered that the resonant frequency of the localized phase depends on
the gate voltage. We attribute this phenomenon to the specific depletion of the
conductive profile in the ungated region of the 2DEG, the so-called edge gating
effect. Although we study a specific case of plasmons in AlGaN/GaN grating-gate
structures, our results have a general character and are applicable to any
other semiconductor-based plasmonic crystal structures. Our work represents the
first demonstration of an electrically tunable transition between different
phases of THz plasmonic crystals, which is a crucial step towards a deeper
understanding of THz plasma physics and the development of all-electrically
tunable devices for THz optoelectronics.

<h3>Observation of linear magnetoelectric effect in a Dirac magnon  antiferromagnet Cu$_3$TeO$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cu$_3$TeO$_6$, a three-dimensional antiferromagnet forming a unique spin-web
lattice of spin-1/2 Cu2+ ions below the Neel temperature T$_N$ = 62 K, has
recently been found to exhibit topological Dirac or nodal magnon dispersion. In
this study, we report the discovery of the linear magnetoelectric (ME) effects
in Cu$_3$TeO$_6$ below TN. Our pyroelectric current measurements at a constant
magnetic field (H) reveal a linear increase of electric polarization (P) with H
for both P // H and P $\perp$ H configurations; a maximum P // [110] = 20
$\mu$C/m$^2$ is obtained at u0H // [1-10] = 14 T, corresponding to a linear ME
coefficient 1.8 ps/m. Magnetic point group analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations
confirm that finite linear ME coefficients are allowed in the off-diagonal and
diagonal ME tensor components, consistent with the magnetic point group of
$\bar{3}'$. As the parity-time symmetry can be broken in the presence of H or
electric field E in the linear ME materials, we envisage that Cu$_3$TeO$_6$
should exhibit a H- or E-induced transformation in the topological magnon
dispersion from a Dirac point/nodal line type into two Weyl point types.

<h3>Scaling Description of Dynamical Heterogeneity and Avalanches of  Relaxation in Glass-Forming Liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00219</a>
<br>
<i>Ali Tahaei, Giulio Biroli, Misaki Ozawa, Marko Popović, Matthieu Wyart</i>
<br>
<br>
We provide a theoretical description of dynamical heterogeneities in
glass-forming liquids, based on the premise that relaxation occurs via local
rearrangements coupled by elasticity. In our framework, the growth of the
dynamical correlation length $\xi$ and of the correlation volume $\chi_4$ are
controlled by a zero-temperature fixed point. We connect this critical behavior
to the properties of the distribution of local energy barriers at zero
temperature. Our description makes a direct connection between dynamical
heterogeneities and avalanche-type relaxation associated to dynamic
facilitation, allowing us to relate the size distribution of heterogeneities to
their time evolution. Within an avalanche, a local region relaxes multiple
times, the more the larger is the avalanche. This property, related to the
nature of the zero-temperature fixed point, directly leads to decoupling of
particle diffusion and relaxation time (the so-called Stokes-Einstein
violation). Our most salient predictions are tested and confirmed by numerical
simulations of scalar and tensorial thermal elasto-plastic models.

<i>Giorgio Krstulovic, Marc E. Brachet</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we first briefly review some of the mutual friction effects on
vortex lines and rings that were obtained in the context of the truncated
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in references Krstulovic & Brachet [Phys. Rev. E
83(6), 066311 and Phys.Rev.B 83, 132506 (2011)], with particular attention to
the anomalous slowdown of rings produced by thermally excited Kelvin waves. We
then study the effect of mutual friction on the relaxation and fluctuations of
Kelvin waves on straight vortex lines by comparing the results of full $3D$
direct simulations of the truncated Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a simple
stochastic Local-Induction-Approximation model with mutual friction and thermal
noise included. This new model allows us to determine the mutual friction
coefficient $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ for the truncated Gross-Pitaevskii equation

Superionic conductors offer unique advantages for novel technological devices
in various fields, such as energy storage and neuromorphic computing. Above 414
K, Cu2Se turns into a well-known superionic conductor via a phase transition,
and it is demonstrated to exhibit peculiar electrical and thermoelectric
properties in bulk. Here, we report a large-area synthesis of ultra-thin single
crystalline Cu2Se using the chemical vapor deposition method. We demonstrate
that Cu2Se crystals exhibit optically and electrically controllable robust
phase reconfiguration below 414 K. Moreover, our results show that the mobility
of the liquid-like Cu ion vacancies in Cu2Se causes macroscopic fluctuations in
the Cu ordering. Consequently, phase variations are not dictated by the
diffusive motion of the ions but by the local energy minima formed due to the
interplay between the extrinsic and the intrinsic material parameters. As a
result, long-range ordering of the crystal below 414 K is optically observable
at a micrometer scale. Our results show that Cu2Se could find applications
beyond thermoelectric such as smart optical coatings, optoelectronic switching,
and ionic transistors.

Assuming the self-consistent theory of localization due to Abou-Chacra et
al., we solve the N=1 Wegner model in the regime of strong disorder and high

phenomena associated with fractal eigenstates and singular continuous spectra.

<h3>Anomalous Hall effect and magnetic structure of the topological  semimetal (Mn$_{0.78}$Fe$_{0.22}$)$_{3}$Ge</h3>

<br>
<br>
Me$_{3+\delta}$Ge, being a Weyl semimetal, shows a large anomalous Hall
effect (AHE), which decreases slowly with an increase in $\delta$ from 0.1 to
0.4. However, AHE in this compound remains significantly large in the whole
range of $\delta$ because of the robust nature of the topology of bands. To
explore the possibility of tuning the anomalous transport effects in Weyl
semimetals, we have studied the single-crystal
hexagonal-(Mn$_{0.78}$Fe$_{0.22}$)$_3$Ge compound. Magnetization of this
compound shows two magnetic transitions at 242 K ($T_{\text{N1}}$) and 120 K
($T_{\text{N2}}$). We observed that the AHE persists between $T_{\text{N2}}$ -
$T_{\text{N1}}$ and vanishes below $T_{\text{N2}}$. Further, we performed
single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments (using spherical neutron
polarimetry and unpolarized neutron diffraction) to determine the magnetic
structures of (Mn$_{0.78}$Fe$_{0.22}$)$_3$Ge at different temperatures. Our
neutron diffraction results show that the sample possesses a collinear
antiferromagnetic structure below $T_{\text{N2}}$. However, the magnetic
structure of the sample remains noncollinear antiferromagnetic, the same as
Mn$_3$Ge, between $T_{\text{N1}}$ to $T_{\text{N2}}$. The presence of AHE, and
noncollinear magnetic structure in (Mn$_{0.78}$Fe$_{0.22}$)$_3$Ge, between
$T_{\text{N1}}$ and $T_{\text{N2}}$, suggest the existence of Weyl points in
this temperature regime. Below $T_{\text{N2}}$, AHE is absent, and the magnetic
structure also changes to a collinear antiferromagnetic structure. These
observations signify a strong link between the magnetic structure of the sample
and AHE.

<h3>Softening of the Hertz indentation contact in nematic elastomers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00255</a>

<br>

Polydomain liquid crystalline (nematic) elastomers have highly unusual
mechanical properties, dominated by the dramatically non-linear stress-strain
response that reflects stress-induced evolution of domain patterns. Here, we
study the classical Hertz indentation problem in such a material.
Experimentally, we find that polydomain nematic elastomers display a smaller
exponent than the classical 3/2 in the load vs. indentation depth response.
This is puzzling: asymptotically a softer stress-strain response requires a
larger exponent at small loads. We resolve this by theory where three regimes
are identified -- an initial elastic regime for shallow indentation that is
obscured in experiment, an intermediate regime where local domain pattern
evolution leads to a smaller scaling in agreement with experiments, and a final
stiffening regime where the completion of local domain evolution returns the
response to elastic. This three-regime structure is universal, but the
intermediate exponent is not. We discuss how our work reveals a new mechanism
of enhanced adhesion for pressure-sensitive adhesion of nematic elastomers.

We investigate the impact of non-collinear dual optical excitation on
magnetization precession in a permalloy thin film using two ultrashort laser
pulses. By analyzing the magnetization dynamics using time-resolved
magneto-optical methods, we find that excitation with two ultrashort optical
pulses introduces long-lasting modification of the electron system seen as a
significant increase (about a factor of 2 more) in magnetic damping. Our
results reveal that the observed effect strongly depends on the respective
polarization of the two excitation pulses and the time delay between them. Our
findings may indicate the occurrence of a new physical effect during
photoexcitation with two non-collinear optical pulses, which can potentially be
observed in various materials and with photon excitations at different
energies.

Fe-based metallic glasses are promising functional materials for advanced
magnetism and sensor fields. Tailoring magnetic performance in amorphous
materials requires a thorough knowledge of the correlation between structural
disorder and magnetic order, which remains ambiguous. Two practical
difficulties remain: the first is directly observing subtle magnetic structural
changes on multiple scales, and the second is precisely regulating the various
amorphous states. Here we propose a novel approach to tailor the amorphous
structure through the liquid liquid phase transition. In-situ synchrotron
diffraction has unraveled a medium-range ordering process dominated by
edge-sharing cluster connectivity during the liquid-liquid phase transition.
Moreover, nanodomains with topological order have been found to exist in
composition with liquid-liquid phase transition, manifesting as hexagonal
patterns in small-angle neutron scattering profiles. The liquid-liquid phase
transition can induce the nanodomains to be more locally ordered, generating
stronger exchange interactions due to the reduced Fe-Fe bond and the enhanced
structural order, leading to the increment of saturation magnetization.
Furthermore, the increased local heterogeneity in the medium range scale
enhances the magnetic anisotropy, promoting the permeability response under
applied stress and leading to a better stress-impedance effect. These
experimental results pave the way to tailor the magnetic structure and
performance through the liquid-liquid phase transition.

<h3>Density functional descriptions of interfacial electronic structure</h3>

Heterogeneous interfaces are central to many energy-related applications in
the nanoscale. From the first-principles electronic structure perspective, one
of the outstanding problems is accurately and efficiently calculating how the
frontier quasiparticle levels of one component are aligned in energy with those
of another at the interface, i.e., the so-called interfacial band alignment or
level alignment. The alignment or the energy offset of these frontier levels is
associated with the charge-transfer barrier across the interface and therefore
dictates the interfacial dynamics. Although many-body perturbation theory
provides a formally rigorous framework for computing the interfacial electronic
structure, it is often associated with a high computational cost and is limited
by its perturbative nature. It is therefore of great interest to develop
practical alternatives, preferably based on density functional theory (DFT),
which is known for its balance between efficiency and accuracy. However,
conventional developments of density functionals largely focus on total
energies and thermodynamic properties, and the design of functionals aiming for
interfacial electronic structure is only emerging recently. This Review is
dedicated to a self-contained narrative of the interfacial electronic structure
problem and the efforts of the DFT community in tackling it. Since interfaces
are closely related to surfaces, we first discuss the key physics behind the
surface and interface electronic structure, namely the image potential and the
gap renormalization. This is followed by a review of early examinations of the
surface exchange-correlation hole and the exchange-correlation potential, which
are central quantities in DFT. Lastly, we survey two modern endeavors in
functional development that focus on the interfacial electronic structure,
namely the dielectric-dependent hybrids and local hybrids.

Tuning GaAs-based quantum emitters to telecom wavelengths makes it possible
to use the existing mature technology for applications in, e.g., long-haul
ultra-secure communication in the fiber networks. A promising method
re-developed recently is to use a metamorphic InGaAs buffer that redshifts the
emission by reducing strain. However, the impact of such a buffer causes also a
simultaneous modification of other quantum dot properties. Knowledge of these
effects is crucial for actual implementations of QD-based non-classical light
sources for quantum communication schemes. Here, we thoroughly study single
GaAs-based quantum dots grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on specially designed,
digital-alloy InGaAs metamorphic buffers. With a set of structures varying in
the buffer indium content and providing quantum dot emission through the
telecom spectral range up to 1.6 $\mu$m, we analyze the impact of the buffer
and its composition on QD structural and optical properties. We identify the
mechanisms of quantum dot emission shift with varying buffer composition. We
also look into the charge trapping processes and compare excitonic properties
for different growth conditions with single-dot emission successfully shifted
to both, the second and the third telecom windows.

Making use of refermionization techniques, we map the nonlinear chiral
Luttinger liquid model of the edge modes of a spatially confined fractional
quantum Hall cloud developed in our recent work [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 107}, 033320
(2023)] onto a one-dimensional system of massive and interacting chiral
fermions, whose mass and interactions are set by the filling factor of the
quantum Hall fluid and the shape of the external anharmonic confining potential
at the position of the edge. As an example of the predictive power of the
refermionized theory, we report a detailed study of the dynamic structure
factor and of the spectral function of a fractional quantum Hall cloud. Among
other features, our refermionized theory provides a physical understanding of
the effective decay of the edge excitations and of the universal power-law
exponents at the thresholds of the dynamic structure factor. The quantitative
accuracy of the refermionized theory is validated against full two-dimensional
calculation based on a combination of exact diagonalization and Monte-Carlo
sampling.

<br>
In the rapidly expanding field of topological materials there is growing
interest in systems whose topological electronic band features can be induced
or controlled by magnetism. Magnetic Weyl semimetals, which contain linear band
crossings near the Fermi level, are of particular interest owing to their
exotic charge and spin transport properties. Up to now, the majority of
magnetic Weyl semimetals have been realized in ferro- or ferrimagnetically
ordered compounds, but a disadvantage of these materials for practical use is
their stray magnetic field which limits the minimum size of devices. Here we
show that Weyl nodes can be induced by a helical spin configuration, in which
the magnetization is fully compensated. Using a combination of neutron
diffraction and resonant elastic x-ray scattering, we find that EuCuAs develops
a planar helical structure below $T_\textrm{N}$ = 14.5 K which induces Weyl
nodes along the $\Gamma$--A high symmetry line in the Brillouin zone.

<h3>Nanoscale creep mechanism of clay through MD modeling with hexagonal  particles</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
In this article, we investigate the creep mechanism of clay at the nanoscale.
We conduct the molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of clay samples consisting of
hexagonal particles under compression and shear. The MD simulations include
oedometer creep, shear creep, direct shear tests, and stress relaxation. The
numerical results show that the nanoscale creep mechanism of clay is related to
particle rotation, translation, and stacking under different loading
conditions. The clay sample under creep shows two types of particle
arrangements, i.e., the shifted face-to-face configuration and the face-to-edge
configuration. The orientation angle of clay particles is computed to track the
rotation of individual particles due to creep. The fabric variation of the clay
under creep is characterized by the dihedral angle between the basal particle
plane and the x-y plane and the order parameter. It is found that the factors
affecting the microstructure variation of the clay aggregate include stress
levels, loading rates, and particle sizes. In the nanoscale shear creep test,
the creep process comprises three stages, i.e., primary, secondary, and
tertiary. The microstructure change during creep depends on the initial
alignment of clay particles. The clay creep under a more significant stress
level results in a more considerable order parameter and a more orientated clay
structure.

<h3>Natural orbitals and two-particle correlators as tools for analysis of  effective exchange couplings in solids</h3>

Using generalizations of natural orbitals, spin-averaged natural orbitals,
and two-particle charge correlators for solids, we investigate electronic
structure of antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides with a fully
self-consistent, finite-temperature GW method. Our findings disagree with
Goodenough-Kanamori (GK) rules, commonly used for qualitative interpretation of
such solids. First, we found a strong dependence of natural orbital occupancies
on momenta contradicting GK assumptions. Second, along the momentum path, the
character of natural orbitals changes. In particular, contributions of oxygen
2s orbitals are important, which has not been considered in the GK rules. To
analyze the influence of electronic correlation on the values of effective
exchange coupling constants, we use both natural orbitals and two-particle
correlators and show that electronic screening modulates the degree of
superexchange by stabilizing the charge-transfer contributions, greatly
affecting these coupling constants. Finally, we give a set of predictions and
recommendations regarding the use of density functional, Green's function, and
wave-function methods for evaluating effective magnetic couplings in molecules
and solids.

Fast and efficient switching of nanomagnets is one of the main challenges in
the development of future magnetic memories. We numerically investigate the
evolution of the static and dynamic spin wave (SW) magnetization in short
(50-400 nm length and 120 nm diameter) cylindrical ferromagnetic nanowires,
where competing single vortex (SV) and vortex domain wall with a Bloch point
(BP-DW) magnetization configurations could be formed. For a limited nanowire
length range (between 150 and 300 nm) we demonstrate a reversible microwave
field induced (forward) and opposite spin currents (backwards) transitions
between the topologically different SV and BP-DW states. By tuning the nanowire
length, excitation frequency, the microwave pulse duration and the spin current
values we show that the optimum (low power) manipulation of the BP-DW could be
reached by a microwave excitation tuned to the main SW mode and for nanowire
lengths around 230-250 nm, where single vortex domain wall magnetization
reversal via nucleation and propagation of SV-DW takes place. An analytical
model for dynamics of the Bloch point provides an estimation of the gyrotropic
mode frequency close the one obtained via micromagnetic simulations. A
practical implementation of the method on a device has been proposed involving
microwave excitation and the generation of the opposite spin currents via spin
orbit torque. Our findings open a new pathway for the creation of unforeseen
topological magnetic memories.

Recently, long and slender living worms have garnered significant interest
because of their impressive ability to exhibit diverse emergent behaviors in
highly entangled physical and topological conditions. These worms can form an
active viscoelastic, three-dimensional soft entity known as the 'blob', which
can behave like a solid, flow like a liquid, and even respond to external
stimuli such as light to locomote or change shape. To understand the behavior
of the blob, it is crucial to consider the high degree of conformational
entanglement that individual units can achieve because of their high aspect
ratio and tunable activity. This topologically active collective necessitates
reevaluating established soft matter concepts in polymer physics to advance the
development of active polymer-like materials. Our understanding of the complex
emergent dynamics of the worm blob promises to catalyze further research into
the behavior of entangled active polymers and guide the design of synthetic
topological active matter and bioinspired tangling soft robot collectives.

This study proposes algorithms for building tilt grain boundary (GB) models
with a boundary plane-oriented approach that does not rely on existence of a
coincidence site lattice (CSL). As conventional GB model generation uses the
CSL of superimposed grains as the starting point, our totally different
approach allows systematic treatment of diverse grain boundary systems that was
previously not possible. Candidates of a pair of GB planes for a selected
rotation axis, constituting a symmetrical or asymmetrical tilt GB, are
thoroughly obtained by computational search that is applicable to any crystal
structure. A GB interface for feasible computational analysis would have
two-dimensional (2D) periodicity shared by the 2D lattices of the two GB
planes, hence surface-slab supercells (slab-and-vacuum models) with common
in-plane basis vectors of the shared 2D lattice are obtained. Finally, a
procedure to obtain a GB-model supercell with alternately stacking such slabs
is given. Symmetry operations of each slab may be considered such that the
iterated interfaces are symmetrically equivalent, which is beneficial in ab
initio calculations. The proposed algorithms allow streamlined generation of GB
models, both symmetric and asymmetric, with or without an exact 3D-CSL
relation.

Metal/oxide support perimeter sites are known to provide unique properties
because the nearby metal changes the local environment on the support surface.
In particular, the electron scavenger effect reduces the energy necessary for
surface anion desorption, thereby contributes to activation of the (reverse)
Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This study investigated the possibility of such
activation in hydrides, carbides, nitrides, and sulfides. The work functions
(WFs) of known hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, and sulfides with group 3,
4, or 5 cations (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, and Ta) were calculated. The WFs
of most hydrides, carbides, and nitrides are smaller than the WF of Ag,
implying that the electron scavenger effect may occur when late transition
metal nanoparticles are adsorbed on the surface. The WF of oxides and sulfides
decrease when reduced. The surface anion vacancy formation energy correlates
well with the bulk formation energy in carbides and nitrides, while almost no
correlation is found in hydrides because of the small range of surface hydrogen
vacancy formation energy values. The electron scavenger effect is explicitly
observed in nanorods adsorbed on TiH2 and Ti2O3; the surface vacancy formation
energy decreases at anion sites near the nanorod, and charge transfer to the
nanorod happens when an anion is removed at such sites. Activation of hydrides,
carbides, and nitrides by nanorod adsorption and screening support materials
through WF calculation are expected to open up a new category of supported
catalysts.

<br>
<br>
Spinel oxides are an important class of materials for heterogeneous catalysis
including photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The surface O vacancy formation
energy (EOvac) is a critical quantity on catalyst performance because the
surface of metal oxide catalysts often acts as reaction sites, for example, in
the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, experimental evaluation of EOvac is
very challenging. We obtained the EOvac for (100), (110), and (111) surfaces of
normal zinc-based spinel oxides ZnAl2O4, ZnGa2O4, ZnIn2O4, ZnV2O4, ZnCr2O4,
ZnMn2O4, ZnFe2O4, and ZnCo2O4. The most stable surface is (100) for all
compounds. The smallest EOvac for a surface is the largest in the (100) surface
except for ZnCo2O4. For (100) and (110) surfaces, there is a good correlation,
over all spinels, between the smallest EOvac for the surface and bulk formation
energy, while the ionization potential correlates well in (111) surfaces.
Machine learning over EOvac of all surface sites in all orientations and all
compounds to find the important factors, or descriptors, that decide the EOvac
revealed that bulk and surface-dependent descriptors are the most important,
namely the bulk formation energy, a Boolean descriptor on whether the surface
is (111), and the ionization potential, followed by geometrical descriptors
that are different in each O site.

The coupling between band structure and magnetism can lead to intricate Fermi
surface modifications. Here we report on the comprehensive study of the
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect in two rare-earth-based magnetic Weyl
semimetals, NdAlSi and CeAlSi$_{0.8}$Ge$_{0.2}$. The results show that the
temperature evolution of topologically nontrivial Fermi surfaces strongly
depends on magnetic configurations. In NdAlSi, the SdH frequencies vary with
temperature in both the paramagnetic state and the magnetically ordered state
with a chiral spin texture, but become temperature independent in the
high-field fully polarized state. In CeAlSi$_{0.8}$Ge$_{0.2}$, SdH frequencies
are temperature-dependent only in the ferromagnetic state with magnetic fields
applied along the $c$ axis. First-principles calculations suggest that the
notable temperature and magnetic-configuration dependence of Fermi surface
morphology can be attributed to strong exchange coupling between the conduction
electrons and local magnetic moments.

A one-dimensional Bose Hubbard model with unidirectional hopping is shown to
be exactly solvable. Applying the algebraic Bethe ansatz method, we prove the
integrability of the model and derive the Bethe ansatz equations. The exact
eigenvalue spectrum can be obtained by solving these equations. The
distribution of Bethe roots reveals the presence of a superfluid-Mott insulator
transition at the ground state, and the critical point is determined. By
adjusting the boundary parameter, we demonstrate the existence of non-Hermitian
skin effect even in the presence of interaction, but it is completely
suppressed for the Mott insulator state. Our result represents a new class of
exactly solvable non-Hermitian many-body systems, which have no Hermitian
correspondence and can be used as a benchmark for various numerical techniques
developed for non-Hermitian many-body systems.

The discovery of superconductivity in CaC6 with a critical temperature (Tc)
of 11.5 K reignites much interest in exploring high-temperature
superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Here we identify
a GIC NaC4, discovered by ab initio evolutionary structure search, as a
superconductor with a computed Tc of 41.2 K at 5 GPa. This value is eight times
higher than that of the synthesized GIC NaC2 and possesses the highest Tc among
available GICs. The remarkable superconductivity of GIC NaC4 mainly arises from
the coupling of {\pi} electrons in graphene with the low-frequency vibrations
involving both Na and C atoms. These findings suggest that Na-GIC may hold
great promise as a high-Tc superconductor.

A singular flat band(SFB), a distinct class of the flat band, has been shown
to exhibit various intriguing material properties characterized by a geometric
quantity of the Bloch wave function called the quantum distance. We present a
general construction scheme for a tight-binding model hosting an SFB, where the
quantum distance profile can be controlled. We first introduce how to build a
compact localized state(CLS), a characteristic eigenstate of the flat band,
providing the flat band with a band-touching point, where a specific value of
the maximum quantum distance is assigned. Then, we develop a scheme designing a
tight-binding Hamiltonian hosting an SFB starting from the obtained CLS,
satisfying the desired hopping range and symmetries by applying the
construction scheme. While the scheme can be applied to any dimensions and
lattice structures, we propose several simple SFB models on the square and
kagome lattices. Finally, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence between
the maximum quantum distance and the boundary modes for the open boundary
condition, which can be used to detect the quantum distance via the electronic
structure of the boundary states.

This study focuses on the microstructure's evolution upon different aging
conditions of a high-strength low-density steel with a composition of
Fe-28Mn-9Al-1C.The steel is hot-rolled, subsequently quenched without any
solution treatment, and then aged under different conditions. The
microstructure of the samples was studied by means of Scanning Electron
Microscopy, Electron Backscatter Diffraction, and Transmission Electron
Microscopy. The aging treatment leads to the formation of an ordered
face-centered cubic L12 phase named k-carbide. This study aims to characterize
the formation and growth of these k-carbides qualitatively and quantitatively
under different aging conditions. Then, an effort is made to relate the
fraction and size of this phase with the tensile properties of the steel to
determine the optimal aging conditions that will lead to a good combination of
strength and ductility. It has been found that the k-carbides start to form
intragranularly through concentration fluctuations of aluminum and manganese
inside the austenite grain. Then, with the process of spinodal decomposition,
they grow in size coherently with the matrix. During this process, the strength
and hardness of the steel increase while maintaining a relatively high
elongation. The best combination of high strength and ductility was achieved at
the aging condition of 8 h at 550 degrees Celsius with an ultimate tensile
strength up to 1157 MPa and total elongation of 51%. Increasing the aging
temperature and time, k-carbides start to form intergranularly, lose their
coherency with the matrix and severely compromise the hardness and strength.
The shearing of the carbides during deformation is also studied.

derive a geometric phase for the fermions in the system. We also discuss the

We suggest a nanoelectromechanical setup and corresponding time protocol of
its manipulation by which we transduce quantum information from charge qubit to
nanomechanical cat state. The setup is based on the AC Josephson effect between
bulk superconductors and mechanically vibrating mesoscopic superconducting
island in the regime of the Cooper pair box. Starting with a pure state with
quantum information initially encoded into superposition of the Cooper pair box
states, applying a specially tailored time protocol upon bias voltage and gate
electrodes, we obtain a new pure state with information finally encoded into
superposition of nanomechanical coherent states constituting the cat state.
This performance is achieved using quantum entanglement between electrical and
mechanical states. Nanomechanical cat states serve as a storage of quantum
information, motivated by significantly longer decoherence time with respect to
the charge qubit states, from which the information can be transdued back to
the charge qubit applying the reverse time protocol.

Unraveling the complexities of random packing in three dimensions has long
puzzled physicists. While both experiments and simulations consistently show a
maximum density of 64 percent for tightly packed random spheres, we still lack
an unambiguous and universally accepted definition of random packing. This
paper introduces an innovative standpoint, depicting random packing as spheres
closest to a quenched Poisson field of random points. We furnish an efficacious
algorithm to probe this proposed model numerically. We unearth a unique
out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic phenomenon, akin to a `latent heat', that
emerges at $\phi_J \approx 0.65$ in three dimensions. This phenomenon is
accompanied by global and local structural rearrangements, marking a jamming
transition from an unjammed state to a jammed one. Notably, such a `jamming'
transition is absent for two-dimensional random packing. Our innovative
approach paves a new avenue for defining random packing and provides novel
insights into the behavior of amorphous materials.

We perform a numerical study of transport properties of a one-dimensional
chain
with couplings decaying as an inverse power $r^{-(1+\sigma)}$ of the
intersite distance $r$ and open boundary conditions, interacting with tho heat
reservoirs. Despite its simplicity, the model displays highly nontrivial
features in the strong long-range regime, $-1<\sigma<0$. At weak coupling with
the reservoirs, the energy flux departs from the predictions of perturbative
theory and displays anomalous superdiffusive scaling of the heat current with
the chain size. We trace back this behavior to the transmission spectrum of the
chain, which displays a self-similar structure with a characteristic
sigma-dependent fractal dimension.

Emergence of inorganic metal halide perovskites as multifunctional
optoelectronic materials are due to their exceptional tunability in
optoelectronic properties. This study sought to enhance the physical and
mechanical properties of lead-free FrGeI3 perovskites by introducing transition
metal dopants (Mn, Co, and Ni). First-principle calculations based density
functional theory (DFT) have been utilized to illustrate the impact of
transition-metal doping on the structural, electronic, and light-matter
interaction properties of FrGeI3. The study found that transition metal doping
in FrGeI3 perovskites leads to an increase in the electronic bandgap leading to
semiconducting behavior after phase stability confirmation. Enhanced optical
and mechanical properties suggest wide industrial applications in
optoelectronics to biomedical area. This study provides a sound understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of transition metal doping in Fr-contained halide
perovskites, which could pave the way to the headway of new optoelectronic and
biomedical devices based on these materials.

Recently the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has attracted a lot of
attention due to new possibilities in the field of superconducting electronics.
One of the possible realizations of the SDE is the implementation in
superconducting hybrid structures. In this case the SDE is achieved by means of
the proximity effect. However, the optimal conditions for the SDE quality
factor in hybrid devices remain unclear. In this study we consider the
Superconductor/Ferromagnet/Topological insulator (S/F/TI) hybrid device and
investigate the diode quality factor at different parameters of the hybrid
structure. Consequently, we reveal important parameters that have crucial
impact on the magnitude of the SDE quality factor.

Films of metal-insulator nanogranular composites M$_x$D$_{100-x}$ with
different composition and percentage of metal and dielectric phases (M = Fe,
Co, CoFeB; D = Al$_2$O$_3$, SiO$_2$, LiNbO$_3$; x $\approx$ 15-70 at.%) are
investigated by magnetic resonance in a wide range of frequencies (f = 7-37
GHz) and temperatures (T = 4.2-360 K). In addition to the usual ferromagnetic
resonance signal from an array of nanogranules, the experimental spectra
contain an additional absorption peak, which we associate with the electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of Fe and Co ions dispersed in the insulating
space between the granules. In contrast to the traditional EPR of Fe and Co
ions in weakly doped non-magnetic matrices, the observed peak demonstrates a
number of unusual properties, which we explain by the presence of magnetic
interactions between ions and granules.

The Callan-Harvey mechanism in 2+1 D Jackiw-Rebbi model is revisited. We
analyzed Callan-Harvey anomaly inflow in the massive Chern insulator (quantum
anomalous Hall system) subject to external electric field. In addition to the
conventional current flowing from the bulk to edge due to parity anomaly, we
considered the dissipation of the edge charge due to interaction with external
bosonic bath in 2+1 D and due to external bath of photons in 3+1 D. In the case
of 2+1 D bosonic bath, we found the new stationary state, which is defined by
the balance between Callan-Harvey current and the outgoing flow caused by the
dissipation processes. In the case of 3+1 D photon bath, we found a critical
electric field, below which this balance state can be achieved, but above which
there is no such a balance. Furthermore, we estimated the photon-mediated
transition rate between 2+1 D bulk and 1+1 D topological edge state of the
order of one ns$^{-1}$ (nanosecond) at the room temperature.

<h3>The fate of time-reversal symmetry breaking in UTe2</h3>

<br>
Topological superconductivity is a long-sought state of matter in bulk
materials, and odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$ is a prime candidate. The
recent observation of a field-trainable spontaneous Kerr signal in UTe$_2$ at
the onset of superconductivity provides strong evidence that the
superconducting order parameter is multicomponent and breaks time-reversal
symmetry. Here, we perform Kerr effect measurements on a number of UTe$_2$
samples -- grown $via$ both chemical vapor transport and the molten-salt-flux
methods -- that show a single superconducting transition between 1.6~K and
2.1~K. Our results show no evidence for a spontaneous Kerr signal in zero field
measurements. This implies that the superconducting state of UTe$_2$ does not
intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry. Instead, we observe a
field-trainable signal that varies in magnitude between samples and between
different locations on a single sample, which is a sign of inhomogeneous
magnetic regions. Our results provide an examination of representative UTe$_2$
samples and place strong constraints on the superconducting order parameter of
UTe$_2$.

<h3>Favorable phase transitions induced by spinful electron-electron  interactions in two-dimensional semimetal with a quadratic band crossing  point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00648" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00648</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Sheng Fu, Jing Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of marginally spinful electron-electron interactions on
the low-energy instabilities and favorable phase transitions in a
two-dimensional (2D) spin-$1/2$ semimetal that owns a quadratic band crossing
point (QBCP) parabolically touched by the upper and lower bands. In the
framework of a renormalization group procedure, all sorts of interactions are
treated on the equal footing to derive the coupled energy-dependent evolutions
of all interaction couplings that govern the low-energy properties. Deciphering
the essential physical information of such flows, we at first find that the
tendencies of interaction parameters fall into three categories including Limit
case, Special case, and General case based on the initial conditions. In
addition, the 2D QBCP system is attracted to several distinct kinds of fixed
points (FPs) in the interaction-parameter space, namely
$\mathrm{FP}_1^{+}$/$\mathrm{FP}_2^{-}$, $\mathrm{FP}_1^{\pm}$/
$\mathrm{FP}_2^{\pm}$/$\mathrm{FP}_3^{\pm}$, and
$\mathrm{FP}_1^{\pm}/\mathrm{FP}_3^{\pm}/\mathrm{FP}_{41,42,43}^{\pm}$ with the
subscripts characterizing the features of FPs for the Limit, Special, and
General cases, respectively. Furthermore, as approaching these FPs, we
demonstrate that the spinful fermion-fermion interactions can induce a number
of favorable instabilities accompanied by certain phase transitions.
Specifically, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH), quantum spin Hall (QSH), and
nematic (Nem.) site(bond) states are dominant for $\mathrm{FP}_{1}^{\pm}$,
$\mathrm{FP}_{2}^{\pm}$, and $\mathrm{FP}_{3}^{\pm}$, respectively. Rather, QSH
becomes anisotropic nearby $\mathrm{FP}_{41,42,43}^{\pm}$ with one component
leading and the others subleading. Besides, Nem.site(bond), chiral
superconductivity, and nematic-spin-nematic (NSN.) site(bond) are subleading
candidates around these FPs.

Comprehensive studies are made on the six-state clock universality of two
models using several approaches. We apply the machine-learning technique of
phase classification to the antiferromagnetic (AF) three-state Potts model on
the square lattice with ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) coupling and
the triangular AF Ising model with anisotropic NNN coupling to study two
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. We also use the Monte Carlo
simulation paying attention to the ratio of correlation functions of different
distances for these two models. The obtained results are compared with those of
the previous studies using the level-spectroscopy method. We directly show the
six-state clock universality for totally different systems with the
machine-learning study.

<h3>Subcycle control of valley-selective excitation via dynamical  Franz-Keldysh effect in WSe$_2$ monolayer</h3>

<br>
<i>Shunsuke Yamada, Kazuhiro Yabana, Tomohito Otobe</i>
<br>
<br>
This study performed first-principles calculations based on the
time-dependent density functional theory to control the valley degree of
freedom relating to the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect (DFKE) in a monolayer of
transition metal dichalcogenide. By mimicking the attosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy, we performed numerical pump-probe experiments to
observe DFKE around the $K$ or $K'$ valley in WSe$_2$ monolayer with a
linearly-polarized pump field and a circularly-polarized probe pulse. We found
that the circularly-polarized probe pulse with a given helicity can selectively
observe the transient conductivity modulated by DFKE in each valley. The
transient conductivity and excitation probability around each valley oscillate
with the pump field frequency $\Omega$. The phases of the $\Omega$ oscillation
for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys are opposite to each other. Furthermore, the
pump-driven DFKE alters the absorption rate of WSe$_2$ monolayer and yields the
valley-dependent $\Omega$ oscillation of the electron excitation induced by the
pump plus probe field. With a simplified two-band model, we identified the
$\Omega$ oscillation of the off-diagonal conductivity caused by the band
asymmetry around the valleys as the physical mechanism responsible for the
valley-selective DFKE.

We investigate analytically and numerically the eigenstate thermalization
hypothe- sis (ETH) in terms of a Hermitian operator in the eigenkets selected
from the elements of a real (complex) symmetric random matrix of the Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble (Gaussian unitary ensemble) according to the theory of
random matrices. We propose a method to construting the commensurate
eigenvector basis that are appropriate for the numerical calculation as well as
the diagonal or off-diagonal ETH diagnostics. We also investigate the
integrablity-chaos transition with independent perturbations in terms of the
Berry autocorrelation in semicalssical limit, where there is a phase space
spanned by the momentum-like projection and the range of local wave function.
In such a semiclassical framework, we further develop a method which is base on
the cor- relations of adjacent local points (CALP), to investigate the
integrablity-chaos transi- tion In the presence of uncorrelated peturbations
and correlated integrable eigenstate fluctuations, which is applicable for both
the ergodic and nonergodic systems (where the Berry autocorrelation is
vanishingly small and be nearly one, respectively, similar to the
characteristic of inverse participation ratio (IPR)).

<h3>Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of an ultrathin Fe layer grown on  NiO(001)</h3>

<br>

The magnetic anisotropy and magnetic interactions at the interface between Fe
and NiO(001) were investigated. Depending on the growth conditions of the
NiO(001) layers and the post-annealing temperature, the preferential
magnetization direction of the ultrathin Fe layer grown on a NiO(001) layer
changed from in-plane to a direction perpendicular to the film plane. The
lattice constant of the NiO(001) layers parallel to the growth direction
increased with O$_2$ flow rate, while that parallel to the in-plane were locked
onto the MgO(001) substrate regardless of the growth conditions of the NiO
layers. Moreover, perpendicular magnetization was observed only when the NiO
layer was grown with O$_2$ flow rates higher than 2.0 sccm corresponding to
oxygen-rich NiO. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements revealed an
enhancement in anisotropic orbital magnetic moments similar to the origin of
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the Fe/MgO(001) interface. The interfacial
magnetic anisotropy energies were 0.93 and 1.02 mJ/m$^2$ at room temperature
and at 100 K, respectively, indicating less temperature dependence. In
contrast, the coercivity $H_c$ exhibited a significant temperature dependence.
Although no signature of exchange bias or unidirectional loop shift was
observed, $H_c$ was strongly dependent on the NiO layer thickness, indicating
that the exchange interaction at the interface between the ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic layers was not negligible, despite the NiO(001) being a
spin-compensated surface.

<h3>Microrheology near jamming</h3>

The jamming transition is a nonequilibrium critical phenomenon, which governs
characteristic mechanical properties of jammed soft materials, such as pastes,
emulsions, and granular matters. Both experiments and theory of jammed soft
materials have revealed that the complex modulus measured by conventional
macrorheology exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence. Microrheology is
a new type of method to obtain the complex modulus, which transforms the
microscopic motion of probes to the complex modulus through the generalized
Stokes relation (GSR). Although microrheology has been applied to jammed soft
materials, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, the
validity of the GSR near the jamming transition is far from obvious since there
is a diverging length scale $l_c$, which characterizes the heterogeneous
response of jammed particles. Here, we study the microrheology of jammed
particles by theory and numerical simulation. First, we develop a linear
response formalism to calculate the response function of the probe particle,
which is transformed to the complex modulus via the GSR. Then, we apply our
formalism to a numerical model of jammed particles and find that the storage
and loss modulus follow characteristic scaling laws near the jamming
transition. Importantly, the observed scaling law coincides with that in
macrorheology, which indicates that the GSR holds even near the jamming
transition. We rationalize this equivalence by asymptotic analysis of the
obtained formalism and numerical analysis on the displacement field of jammed
particles under a local perturbation.

The dynamics of ultrathin membranes made of two-dimensional (2D) materials is
highly susceptible to stress. Although the dynamics of such membranes under
tensile stress has been thoroughly studied, their motion under compressive
stress, particular in the buckled state has received less attention. Here, we
study the dynamics of 2D nanomechanical resonators made of FePS$_3$, 2H-TaS$_2$
and WSe$_2$ membranes near the buckling bifurcation. Using an optomechanical
method, we measure their resonant frequency and thermal transport while varying
in-plane stress via membrane temperature and thermal expansion. The observed
temperature dependence of the resonance frequency is well capture by a
mechanical model, which allows us to extract the pre-strain, central deflection
and boundary compressive stress of the membrane. Near the buckling bifurcation,
we observe a remarkable enhancement of up to 7$\times$ the thermal signal in
the fabricated devices, demonstrating the extremely high force sensitivity of
the membranes near this point. The presented results provide insights into the
effects of buckling on the dynamics of free-standing 2D materials and thereby
open up opportunities for the realization of 2D resonant nanomechanical sensors
with buckling-enhanced sensitivity.

In semiconductors, the identification of doping atomic elements allowing to
encode a qubit within spin states is of intense interest for quantum
technologies. In transition metal dichalcogenides semiconductors, the strong
spin-orbit coupling produces locked spin-valley states with expected long
coherence time. Here we study the substitutional Bromine Br\textsubscript{Te}
dopant in 2H-MoTe$_2$. Electron spin resonance measurements show that this
dopant carries a spin with long-lived nanoseconds coherence time. Using
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we find that the hydrogenic wavefunctions
associated with the dopant levels have characteristics spatial modulations that
result from their hybridization to the \textbf{Q}-valleys of the conduction
band. From a Fourier analysis of the conductance maps, we find that the
amplitude and phase of the Fourier components change with energy according to
the different irreducible representations of the impurity-site point-group
symmetry. These results demonstrate that a dopant can inherit the locked
spin-valley properties of the semiconductor and so exhibit long spin-coherence
time.

We study the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model with thermal noise as a
prototypical example of a generic class of non-Hermitian stochastic field
theories, analyzed in two companion papers [Suchanek, Kroy, Loos,
ArXiv:2303.16701 (2023); Suchanek, Kroy, Loos, in preparation]. Due to the
nonreciprocal coupling between two field components, the model is inherently
out of equilibrium and can be regarded as an active field theory. Beyond the
conventional homogeneous and static-demixed phases, it exhibits a
traveling-wave phase, which can be entered via either an oscillatory
instability or a critical exceptional point. By means of a Fourier
decomposition of the entropy production rate, we can quantify the
scale-resolved time-reversal symmetry breaking, in all phases and across the
transitions, in the low-noise limit. Our perturbative calculation reveals its
dependence on the strength of the nonreciprocal coupling. Surging entropy
production near the static-dynamic transitions can be attributed to
entropy-generating fluctuations in the longest wavelength mode and heralds the
emerging traveling wave. Its translational dynamics can be mapped on the
dissipative ballistic motion of an active (quasi)particle.

Recent Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments have revealed a
variety of noncollinear spin textures including topological magnetisms such as
skyrmions, biskyrmions and multiple skyrmions in thin-plate magnetic samples of
e.g., perovskite manganites and hexaferrites whose crystal structures
originally have spatial inversion symmety. Motivated by these experiments, we
investigate a spin-lattice coupled model involving both magnetic and electric
dipole interactions by the Monte Carlo technique based on the stochastic
cut-off method and propose a physical mechanism for realizing topological spin
textures in which the electric dipole interaction plays a key role. This
mechanism is ubiquitous that stabilizes noncollinear and topological spin
textures in thin-plate samples of magnetic materials.

In the present work, some MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets were prepared and
characterized. Depending on the preparation procedures, trigonal prismatic (2H)
or octahedral (1T) coordination of the metal atoms were obtained, exhibiting
metallic (1T) or semiconducting (2H) character. Both MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets
were found exhibiting large nonlinear optical (NLO) response, strongly
dependent on their metallic (1T) or semiconducting (2H) character. So, the
semiconducting character 2H-MoS2 and 2H-WS2 exhibit positive nonlinear
absorption and strong self-focusing, while their metallic character
counterparts exhibit strong negative nonlinear absorption and important
self-defocusing. In addition, the semiconducting MoS2 and WS2 were found
exhibiting important and very broadband optical limiting action extended from
450 to 1750 nm. So, by selecting the crystalline phase of the nanosheets, i.e.,
their semiconduction/metallic character, their NLO response can be greatly
modulated. The results of the present work demonstrate unambiguously that the
control of the crystalline phase of MoS2 and WS2 provides an efficient strategy
for 2D nanostructures with custom made NLO properties for specific
optoelectronic and photonic applications.

Electrochemical reactions for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production are
essential for energy conversion to diminish energy crisis, but still lack
efficient electrocatalysts. Development of non\-noble metal bifunctional
electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and 2e oxygen reduction reaction to
ease reaction kinetics is a challenging task. Integration of single components
by employing easy strategies provides a key\-step towards the realization of
highly active electrocatalysts. In this vein, MoSe2 owns catalytic active sites
and high specific surface area but suffers from insufficient conductivity and
high catalytic performance that noble\-metals provide. Herein, MoSe2 was used
as a platform for the incorporation of manganese metallated porphyrin. The
developed hybrid, namely MoSe2\-MnP, by the initial metal\-ligand coordination
and the subsequent grafting with MnP was fully characterized and
electrochemically assessed. The bifunctional electrocatalyst lowered the
overpotential toward hydrogen evolution, improved reaction kinetics and charge
transfer processes and was extremely stable after 10000 ongoing cycles.
Simultaneously, rotating ring disk electrode analysis showed that oxygen
reduction proceeds through the 2e pathway for the selective production of
hydrogen peroxide with a high yield of 97 percent. The new facile modification
route can be applied in diverse transition metal dichalcogenides and will help
the development of new advanced functional materials.

Recent novel topological antiferromagnetic systems have shown a strong
magnetoresistance effects driven by Dirac fermion characteristics whose
topology can be dynamically controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation. These
new antiferromagnets are characterized by anisotropic band structures combined
with complex relativistic spin structures in momentum space. While these
systems have been studied in transport experiments, very little is known about
their spin-dependent electronic dynamics on ultrafast timescales and
far-from-equilibrium behavior. This paper investigates spin-dependent
electronic dynamics due to electron-phonon scattering in a model electronic
band structure that corresponds to a Dirac semimetal antiferromagnet. Following
a spin-independent instantaneous excitation, we obtain a change of the
antiferromagnetic spin polarization due to the scattering dynamics for the
site-resolved spin expectation values. This allows us to identify fingerprints
of the anisotropic band structure in the carrier dynamics on ultrashort
timescales which should be observable in present experimental set-ups.

One of the key features of non-Hermitian systems is the occurrence of
exceptional points (EPs), spectral degeneracies where the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors merge. In this work, we propose applying neural networks to
characterize EPs by introducing a new feature -- summed phase rigidity (SPR).
We consider different models with varying degrees of complexity to illustrate
our approach, and show how to predict EPs for two-site and four-site gain and
loss models. Further, we demonstrate an accurate EP prediction in the
paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model for a variable number of sites. Remarkably, we
show how SPR enables a prediction of EPs of orders completely unseen by the
training data. Our method can be useful to characterize EPs in an automated
manner using machine learning approaches.

We investigate statistics and scaling laws of avalanches in two-dimensional
frictional particles by numerical simulations. We find that the critical
exponent for avalanche size distributions is governed by microscopic friction
between the particles in contact, where the exponent is larger and closer to
mean-field predictions if the friction coefficient is finite. We reveal that
microscopic ``slips" between frictional particles induce numerous small
avalanches which increase the slope, as well as the power-law exponent, of
avalanche size distributions. We also analyze statistics and scaling laws of
the avalanche duration and maximum stress drop rates, and examine power spectra
of stress drop rates. Our numerical results suggest that the microscopic
friction is a key ingredient of mean-field descriptions and plays a crucial
role in avalanches observed in real materials.

Resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (RIXS) has emerged as an important tool
to explore magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnet realized in
strongly correlated materials. Here we consider the Heisenberg model with
nearest and next nearest neighbor hopping relevant to the study of magnetic
excitations of the cuprate family. We compute the RIXS cross-section within the
ultra-short core-hole lifetime (UCL) expansion of the Kramers-Heisenberg
scattering amplitude that allows perturbative solution within linear spin wave
theory (LSWT). We report detailed results for both spin-conserving and
non-conserving channels. Apart from the widely discussed single magnon and
bimagnon contributions, we show that three-magnon contributions in the spin
non-conserving channel are useful to explain certain features of the RIXS data
for two-dimensional cuprates. We confirm the qualitative correctness of the
LSWT conclusions for the three-magnon excitation with exact diagonalization.
Our work puts constraints on the dispersion of the three-magnon in the
Brillouin zone, opening new avenues for realizing higher modes of
quasiparticles using RIXS.

Understanding spin dynamics on femto- and picosecond timescales offers new
opportunities for faster and more efficient devices. Here, we experimentally
investigate coherent spin dynamics following ultrafast all-optical excited
demagnetization measured by time- resolved magneto optical Kerr effect
(TR-MOKE) in ultrathin Ni80Fe20 films. On nanosecond time scales, we provide a
detailed investigation of the magnetic field and pump fluence dependence of the
GHz frequency precessional dynamics. We discuss how the unusual dependence of
the lifetime of the coherent precession can be related to the dephasing due to
nonlinear magnon interactions and the incoherent magnon background.

<br>
Atomically-precise engineering of defects in topological quantum materials,
which is essential for constructing new artificial quantum materials with
exotic properties and appealing for practical quantum applications, remains
challenging due to the hindrances in modifying complex lattice with atomic
precision. Here, we report the atomically-precise engineering of the
vacancy-localized spin-orbital polarons (SOP) in a kagome magnetic Weyl
semimetal Co3Sn2S2, using scanning tunneling microscope. We achieve the
repairing of the selected single vacancy and create atomically-precise sulfur
quantum antidots with elaborate geometry through vacancy-by-vacancy repairing.
We find that that the bound states of SOP experience a symmetry-dependent
energy shift towards Fermi level with increasing vacancy size driven by the
anti-bond interactions. Strikingly, as vacancy size increases, the localized
magnetic moments of SOPs are tunable and ultimately extended to the negative
magnetic moments resulting from spin-orbit coupling in the kagome flat band.
These findings establish a new platform for engineering atomic quantum states
in topological quantum materials, offering potential for kagome-lattice-based
spintronics and quantum technologies.

Kagome-lattice materials possess attractive properties for quantum computing
applications, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we show surface
kagome electronic states (SKESs) on a Sn-terminated triangular Co3Sn2S2
surface, which are imprinted by vertical p-d electronic hybridization between
the surface Sn (subsurface S) atoms and the buried Co kagome lattice network in
the Co3Sn layer under the surface. Owing to the subsequent lateral
hybridization of the Sn and S atoms in a corner-sharing manner, the kagome
symmetry and topological electronic properties of the Co3Sn layer is proximate
to the Sn surface. The SKESs and both hybridizations were verified via qPlus
non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) and density functional theory
calculations. The construction of SKESs with tunable properties can be achieved
by the atomic substitution of surface Sn (subsurface S) with other group III-V
elements (Se or Te), which was demonstrated theoretically. This work exhibits
the powerful capacity of nc-AFM in characterizing localized topological states
and reveals the strategy for synthesis of large-area transition-metal-based
kagome lattice materials using conventional surface deposition techniques.

<h3>Fractionalization paves the way to local projector embeddings of quantum  many-body scars</h3>

<br>

Many systems that host exact quantum many-body scars (towers of
energy-equidistant low entanglement eigenstates) are governed by a Hamiltonian
that splits into a Zeeman term and a sum of local terms that annihilate the
scar subspace. We show that this unifying structure also applies to models,
such as the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model or the PXP model of
Rydberg-blockaded atoms, that were previously believed to evade this
characterisation. To fit these models within the local annihilator framework we
need to fractionalize their degrees of freedom and enlarge the associated
Hilbert space. The embedding of the original system in a larger space
elucidates the structure of their scar states and simplifies their
construction, revealing close analogies with lattice gauge theories.

<h3>A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive  polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states</h3>

We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly
with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the
repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct
polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it
remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges
resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing)
impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson
interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary
theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that
combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states,
including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact
non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state.
This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities
arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within
this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced
instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in
a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies
between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit
strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum
correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their
characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable
molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques.
This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons
on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.

<h3>Microscopic superexchange model for moiré bilayer in chromium  trihalides</h3>

We construct a microscopic model based on superexchange theory for a moir\'e
bilayer in chromium trihalides (Cr$X_3$, $X=$Br, I). In particular, we derive
analytically the interlayer Heisenberg exchange and the interlayer
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with arbitrary distances ($\mathbf{x}$)
between spins. Importantly, our model takes into account sliding and twisting
geometries in the interlayer $X$-$X$ hopping processes. Unlike previous works,
the $\mathbf{x}$-dependent interlayer exchange is deduced by various sliding
bilayers where the geometry due to the rotation between $X$-planes is omitted.
We argue that excluding twisting may lead to an incomplete interlayer exchange
for a moir\'e bilayer. Using the \textit{ab initio} tight-binding Hamiltonian,
we numerically evaluate the exchange interactions in CrI$_3$. We find that our
analytical model agrees with the previous comprehensive density functional
theory studies. Furthermore, our findings reveal the important role of the
correlation effects in the $X$'s $p$ orbitals, which gives rise to a rich
interlayer magnetic interaction with remarkable tunability.

<h3>Deposition and alignment of fiber suspensions by dip coating</h3>

The dip coating of suspensions made of monodisperse non-Brownian spherical
particles dispersed in a Newtonian fluid leads to different coating regimes
depending on the ratio of the particle diameter to the thickness of the film
entrained on the substrate. In particular, dilute particles dispersed in the
liquid are entrained only above a threshold value of film thickness. In the
case of anisotropic particles, in particular fibers, the smallest
characteristic dimension will control the entrainment of the particle.
Furthermore, it is possible to control the orientation of the anisotropic
particles depending on the substrate geometry. To test the hypotheses, we
performed dip-coating experiments with dilute suspensions of non-Brownian
fibers with different length-to-diameter aspect ratios. We characterize the
number of fibers entrained on the surface of the substrate as a function of the
withdrawal velocity, allowing us to estimate a threshold capillary number below
which all the particles remain in the liquid bath. Besides, we measure the
angular distribution of the entrained fibers for two different substrate
geometries: flat plates and cylindrical rods. We then measure the film
thickness for more concentrated fiber suspensions. The entrainment of the
fibers on a flat plate and a cylindrical rod is primarily controlled by the
smaller characteristic length of the fibers: their diameter. At first order,
the entrainment threshold scales similarly to that of spherical particles. The
length of the fibers only appears to have a minor influence on the entrainment
threshold. No preferential alignment is observed for non-Brownian fibers on a
flat plate, except for very thin films, whereas the fibers tend to align
themselves along the axis of a cylindrical rod for a large enough ratio of the
fiber length to the radius of the cylindrical rod.

obtained for the spinor components.

<h3>DNA-Au (111) Interactions and Transverse Charge Transport Properties for  DNA-Based Electronic Devices</h3>

DNAs charge transfer and self-assembly characteristics have made it a
hallmark of molecular electronics for the past two decades. A fast and
efficient charge transfer mechanism with programmable properties using DNA
nanostructures is required for DNA-based nanoelectronics applications and
devices. The ability to integrate DNA with inorganic substrates becomes
critical in this process. Such integrations may effect the conformation of DNA,
altering the charge transport properties. Thus, using molecular dynamics
simulations and first-principles calculations in conjunction with Greens
function approach, we explore the impact of Au (111) substrate on the
conformation of DNA and analyze its effect on the charge transport. Our results
indicate that DNA sequence, leading its molecular conformation on Au substrate,
is critical to engineer charge transport properties. We demonstrate that DNA
can fluctuate on a gold substrate, sampling various distinct conformations over
time. The energy levels, spatial locations of molecular orbitals and the DNA/Au
contact atoms can differ between these distinct conformations. Depending on the
sequence, at HOMO, the charge transmission differs up to 60 times between the
top ten conformations. We demonstrate that the relative positions of the
nucleobases are critical in determining the conformations and the coupling
between orbitals. We anticipate these results can be extended to other
inorganic surfaces and pave the way for understanding DNA inorganic interface
interaction for future DNA-based electronic devices.

Phase-field modeling is an elegant and versatile computation tool to predict
microstructure evolution in materials in the mesoscale regime. However, these
simulations require rigorous numerical solutions of differential equations,
which are accurate but computationally expensive. To overcome this difficulty,
we combine two popular machine learning techniques, autoencoder and
convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), to accelerate the study of
microstructural evolution without compromising the resolution of the
microstructural representation. After training with phase-field generated
microstructures of ten known compositions, the model can accurately predict the
microstructure for the future nth frames based on previous m frames for an
unknown composition. Replacing n phase-field steps with machine-learned
microstructures can significantly accelerate the in silico study of
microstructure evolution.

We present results of magnetoresistance (MR) measurements in granular NiBi3
nanowires in the resistive state below the superconducting transition
temperature. MR of 100 nm wide nanowires fabricated by focused Ion beam
lithography from granular films of NiBi3 with and without magnetic Ni impurity
were compared. The nanowire containing high concentration of Ni impurity showed
oscillations in MR and also exhibited a negative MR in certain temperature and
field range. None of these effects were observed in the nanowire with no Ni
impurities. Therefore, we argue that this effect is a result of the random
Josephson couplings realized across superconducting NiBi3 grains via magnetic
inter grain regions. Such random couplings can cause local fluctuations in the
density and sign of supercurrent, which can lead to negative MR and
oscillations in MR, as proposed by Kivelson & Spivak [Kivelson et al. Phy. Rev.

Chern insulators, which are the lattice analogs of the quantum Hall states,
can potentially manifest high-temperature topological orders at zero magnetic
field to enable next-generation topological quantum devices. To date, integer
Chern insulators have been experimentally demonstrated in several systems at
zero magnetic field, but fractional Chern insulators have been reported only in
graphene-based systems under a finite magnetic field. The emergence of
semiconductor moir\'e materials, which support tunable topological flat bands,
opens a new opportunity to realize fractional Chern insulators. Here, we report
the observation of both integer and fractional Chern insulators at zero
magnetic field in small-angle twisted bilayer MoTe2 by combining the local
electronic compressibility and magneto-optical measurements. At hole filling
factor {\nu}=1 and 2/3, the system is incompressible and spontaneously breaks
time reversal symmetry. We determine the Chern number to be 1 and 2/3 for the
{\nu}=1 and {\nu}=2/3 gaps, respectively, from their dispersion in filling
factor with applied magnetic field using the Streda formula. We further
demonstrate electric-field-tuned topological phase transitions involving the
Chern insulators. Our findings pave the way for demonstration of quantized
fractional Hall conductance and anyonic excitation and braiding in
semiconductor moir\'e materials.
