<h3>Use of Deep Neural Networks for Uncertain Stress Functions with  Extensions to Impact Mechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16135" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16135</a>
<br>
<i>Garrett Blum, Ryan Doris, Diego Klabjan, Horacio Espinosa, Ron Szalkowski</i>
<p>Stress-strain curves, or more generally, stress functions, are an extremely
important characterization of a material's mechanical properties. However,
stress functions are often difficult to derive and are narrowly tailored to a
specific material. Further, large deformations, high strain-rates, temperature
sensitivity, and effect of material parameters compound modeling challenges. We
propose a generalized deep neural network approach to model stress as a state
function with quantile regression to capture uncertainty. We extend these
models to uniaxial impact mechanics using stochastic differential equations to
demonstrate a use case and provide a framework for implementing this
uncertainty-aware stress function. We provide experiments benchmarking our
approach against leading constitutive, machine learning, and transfer learning
approaches to stress and impact mechanics modeling on publicly available and
newly presented data sets. We also provide a framework to optimize material
parameters given multiple competing impact scenarios.

<h3>Single-exposure elemental differentiation and texture-sensitive  phase-retrieval imaging with a neutron counting micro-channel plate detector</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16159</a>
<br>
<i>Benedicta D. Arhatari, David M. Paganin, Henry Kirkwood, Anton S. Tremsin, Timur E. Gureyev, Alexander M. Korsunsky, Winfried Kockelmann, Felix Hofmann, Eric Huwald, Shu-Yan Zhang, Joe Kelleher, Brian Abbey</i>
<p>Micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors, when used at pulsed-neutron-source
instruments, offer the possibility of high spatial resolution and high contrast
imaging with pixel-level spectroscopic information. Here we demonstrate the
possibility of multimodal analysis including total neutron cross-section
spectra measurements, quantitative material differentiation imaging and
texture-sensitive in-line phase imaging, from a single exposure using an MCP
detector. This multimodal approach operates in full-field imaging mode, with
the neutron transmission spectra acquired at each individual detector pixel.
Due to the polychromatic nature of the beam and spectroscopic resolving
capability of the detector, no energy scanning is required. Good agreement with
the library reference data is demonstrated for neutron cross-section spectra
measurements. Two different images corresponding to two selected energy
bandwidths are used for elemental differentiation imaging. Moreover, the
presence of changes in texture, i.e., preferred grain orientation, in the
sample is identified from our phase-retrieval imaging results.

<h3>Density wave halo around anyons in fractional quantum anomalous hall  states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16216" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16216</a>
<br>
<i>Xue-Yang Song, T. Senthil</i>
<p>The recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in
tunable moir\'e materials encourages study of several new phenomena that may be
uniquely accessible in these platforms. Here, we show that an isolated
localized anyon of the FQAH state will nucleate a `halo' of Charge Density Wave
(CDW) order around it. We demonstrate this effect using a a recently proposed
quantum Ginzburg-Landau theory that describes the interplay between the
topological order of the FQAH and the broken symmetry order of a CDW. The
spatial extent of the CDW order will, in general, be larger than the length
scale at which the fractional charge of the anyon is localized. The strength
and decay length of the CDW order around anyons induced by doping or magnetic
field differs qualitatively from that nucleated by a random potential. Our
results leverage a precise mathematical analogy to earlier studies of the
superfluid-CDW competition of a system of lattice bosons which has been used to
interpret the observed CDW halos around vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors.
We show that measurement of these patches of CDW order can give an indirect
route to measuring the fractional charge of the anyon. Such a measurement may
be possible by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in moir\'e systems.

<h3>Dynamical separation of charge and energy transport in the sine-Gordon  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16234</a>
<br>
<i>Frederik Møller, Botond C. Nagy, Márton Kormos, Gábor Takács</i>
<p>The sine-Gordon model is an integrable quantum field theory that provides the
low-energy effective description of several one-dimensional gapped condensed
matter systems, including recent realisations with trapped ultra-cold atoms.
Employing the theory of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that this
model exhibits separation of the transport of topological charge vs. energy.
Analysis of the quasiparticle dynamics reveals that the mechanism behind the
separation is the reflective scattering between topologically charged
kinks/antikinks. The effect of these scattering events is most pronounced at
strong coupling and low temperatures, where the distribution of quasiparticles
is narrow compared to the reflective scattering amplitude. This effect results
in a distinctively shaped ``arrowhead'' light cone for the topological charge.

<h3>Entanglement of Gauge Theories: from the Toric Code to the  $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Higgs Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16235" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16235</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Tao Xu, Michael Knap, Frank Pollmann</i>
<p>The toric code (TC) model subjected to a magnetic field can be mapped to the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge Higgs ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH) model. Although this
isometric mapping preserves the bulk energy spectrum, here, we show that it has
a non-trivial effect on the entanglement structure. We derive a quantum channel
that allows us to obtain the reduced density matrix of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH
model from the one of the TC model. We then contrast the ground state
entanglement spectra (ES) of the two models. Analyzing the role of the
electric-magnetic duality, we show that while the ES of the TC model is
enriched by the duality, the ES of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH model is in fact not.
This thus represents an example where the bulk-boundary correspondence fails.
Moreover, the quantum channel allows us to investigate the entanglement
distillation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ GH model from the TC model.

<h3>The Conjugate Composite Fermi Liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16250" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16250</a>
<br>
<i>Nayan Myerson-Jain, Chao-Ming Jian, Cenke Xu</i>
<p>Recent experimental observations of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall
effect in spin/valley polarized moir\'{e} systems call for a more expansive
theoretical exploration of strongly correlated physics in partially filled
topological bands. In this work we study a state that we refer to as the
conjugate-composite Fermi liquid (cCFL), which arises when a pair of Chern
bands with opposite Chern numbers are both half-filled. We demonstrate that the
cCFL is the parent state of various interesting phenomena. As an example, we
demonstrate that with the existence of an inplane spin order, the cCFL could be
driven into a quantum bad metal phase, in the sense that it is a metallic phase
whose zero temperature longitudinal resistivity is finite, but far greater than
the Mott-Ioffe-Regal limit, i.e. $\rho^e_{xx} \gg h/e^2$. Other proximate
phases of the cCFL such as superconductivity and a chiral spin liquid phase can
occur when the composite fermions (CF) form the inter-valley CF-exciton
condensate.

<h3>Perspective on new implementations of atomtronic circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16257</a>
<br>
<i>Juan Polo, Wayne J. Chetcuti, Enrico C. Domanti, Philip Kitson, Andreas Osterloh, Francesco Perciavalle, Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico</i>
<p>In this article, we provide perspectives for atomtronics circuits on quantum
technology platforms beyond simple bosonic or fermionic cold atom matter-wave
currents. Specifically, we consider (i) matter-wave schemes with
multi-component quantum fluids; (ii) networks of Rydberg atoms that provide a
radically new concept of atomtronics circuits in which the flow, rather than in
terms of matter, occurs through excitations; (iii) hybrid matter-wave circuits
- cavities systems that can be used to study atomtronic circuits beyond the
standard solutions and provide new schemes for integrated matter-wave networks.
We also sketch how driving these systems can open new pathways for atomtronics.

<h3>Gilbert damping in two-dimensional metallic anti-ferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16268</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Sokolewicz, Mikhail Baglai, Ivan Ado, Mikhail Katsnelson, Mikhail Titov</i>
<p>A finite spin life-time of conduction electrons may dominate Gilbert damping
of two-dimensional metallic anti-ferromagnets or anti-ferromagnet/metal
heterostructures. We investigate the Gilbert damping tensor for a typical
low-energy model of a metallic anti-ferromagnet system with honeycomb magnetic
lattice and Rashba spin-orbit coupling for conduction electrons. We distinguish
three regimes of spin relaxation: exchange-dominated relaxation for weak
spin-orbit coupling strength, Elliot-Yafet relaxation for moderate spin-orbit
coupling, and Dyakonov-Perel relaxation for strong spin-orbit coupling. We
show, however, that the latter regime takes place only for the in-plane Gilbert
damping component. We also show that anisotropy of Gilbert damping persists for
any finite spin-orbit interaction strength provided we consider no spatial
variation of the N\'eel vector. Isotropic Gilbert damping is restored only if
the electron spin-orbit length is larger than the magnon wavelength. Our theory
applies to MnPS3 monolayer on Pt or to similar systems.

<h3>Derivation of the generalized Zurek's bound from a detailed fluctuation  theorem</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16269" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16269</a>
<br>
<i>Jihai Zhu</i>
<p>We consider the minimal heat that must be released to the reservoir when
accomplishing a map from a single input $x$ to a single output $y$. It was
previously argued by Zurek in an informal style that the minimal heat should be
$K(x|y)$. Recently, Kolchinsky has rigorously proved a generalized Zurek's
bound in the Hamiltonian "two-point measurement" scheme, which implies a
trade-off between heat, noise and protocol complexity in a computation from $x$
to $y$. Here we propose another proof of the generalized Zurek's bound from a
detailed fluctuation theorem, showing that the generalized Zurek's bound holds
in any system that satisfies a DFT. Several applications of the bound are also
introduced.

<h3>Near-resonant nuclear spin detection with high-frequency mechanical  resonators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16273" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16273</a>
<br>
<i>Diego A. Visani, Letizia Catalini, Christian L. Degen, Alexander Eichler, Javier del Pino</i>
<p>Mechanical resonators operating in the high-frequency regime have become a
versatile platform for fundamental and applied quantum research. Their
exceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them
also very appealing for force sensing experiments. In this Letter, we propose a
method for detecting and ultimately controlling nuclear spins by directly
coupling them to high-frequency resonators via a magnetic field gradient.
Dynamical backaction between the sensor and an ensemble of nuclear spins
produces a shift in the sensor's resonance frequency, which can be measured to
probe the spin ensemble. Based on analytical as well as numerical results, we
predict that the method will allow nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging with a
range of realistic devices. At the same time, this interaction paves the way
for new manipulation techniques, similar to those employed in cavity
optomechanics, enriching both the sensor's and the spin ensemble's features.

<h3>Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Hand Gesture Recognition in Large  Area Monolithic Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16284" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16284</a>
<br>
<i>Gethin Thomas, Adam Pockett, Kris Seunarine, Matt Carnie</i>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become prevalent, embedding
intelligence into our environment. It is projected that over 75 billion IoT
devices will be connected by 2025 worldwide, with the majority being operated
indoors. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have recently been optimized for
ambient light, having the capabilities of providing sufficient energy for
self-powered IoT devices. Interaction with digital technologies, termed Human
Computer Interaction (HCI), is often achieved via physical mechanisms (e.g.
remote controls, cell phones) which can hinder the natural interface between
users and IoT devices, a key consideration for HCI. What if the solar cell that
is powering the IoT device can also recognize hand gestures which would allow
the user to naturally interact with the system? Previous attempts to achieve
this have necessarily employed an array of solar cell/photodiodes to detect
directionality. In this work, we demonstrate that by monitoring the
photocurrent output of an asymmetrically patterned monolithic (i.e., single
cell) DSSC, and using machine learning, we can recognize simple hand gestures,
achieving an accuracy prediction of 97.71%. This work shows that, DSSCs are the
perfect choice for self-powered interactive technologies, both in terms of
powering IoT devices in ambient light conditions and having aesthetic qualities
that are prioritized by users. As well as powering interactive technologies,
they can also provide a means of interactive control.

<h3>Emission Redshift in DCM2-Doped Alq$_{3}$ Caused by Non-Linear Stark  Shifts and Förster-Mediated Exciton Diffusion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16289" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16289</a>
<br>
<i>Graziâni Candiotto, Ronaldo Giro, Bruno A. C. Horta, Flávia P. Rosselli, Marcelo de Cicco, Carlos A. Achete, Marco Cremona, Rodrigo B. Capaz</i>
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) devices in the archetype small molecule
fluorescent guest-host system tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq$_{3}$)
doped with 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-julolidyl-9-enyl-4H-pyran (DCM2)
displays a redshift in light-emission frequency which is extremely sensitive to
the dopant concentration. This effect can be used to tune the emission
frequency in this particular class of OLEDs. In this work, a model is proposed
to describe this effect using a combination of density functional theory (DFT)
quantum-chemical calculations and stochastic simulations of exciton diffusion
via a F\"orster mechanism. The results show that the permanent dipole moments
of the Alq$_{3}$ molecules generate random electric fields that are large
enough to cause a non-linear Stark shift in the band gap of neighboring DCM2
molecules. As a consequence of these non-linear shifts, a non-Gaussian
probability distribution of highest-occupied molecular orbital to
lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gaps for the DCM2 molecules in
the Alq$_{3}$ matrix is observed, with long exponential tails to the low-energy
side. Surprisingly, this probability distribution of DCM2 HOMO-LUMO gaps is
virtually independent of DCM2 concentration into Alq$_{3}$ matrix, at least up
to a fraction of 10%. This study shows that this distribution of gaps, combined
with out-of-equilibrium exciton diffusion among DCM2 molecules, are sufficient
to explain the experimentally observed emission redshift.

<i>Fernanda Pinilla, Wilver A. Muriel, Javiera Cabezas-Escares, Ignacio Chacon, Carlos Cardenas, Francisco Munoz</i>
<p>Van der Waals heterostructures are promising for adding new functionalities
to two-dimensional materials. In this study, we focus on single photon emitters
hosted in one layer and adjacent to other insulating two-dimensional material.
Specifically, we show how the emission energy is modified by such a
heterostructure. We developed a general approach to elucidate the mechanisms
affecting the emission energy and studied the particular case of carbon
substitutions in the hexagonal boron nitride bilayer.

<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16323</a>
<br>
<i>Imteaz Rahaman, Hunter D. Ellis, Kai Fu</i>
<p>We report a novel approach for crafting robust diamond/\b{eta}-Ga2O3
hetero-p-n-junctions through the mechanical integration of their bulk
materials. This resulting heterojunction, with a turn-on voltage of ~2.7 V at
room temperature, exhibits resilient electrical performance across a
temperature spectrum up to 125{\deg}C, displaying minimal hysteresis-measuring
as low as 0.2 V at room temperature and below 0.7 V at 125{\deg}C. Remarkably,
the ideality factor achieves a record low value of 1.28, setting a new
benchmark for diamond/ \b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunctions. The rectification ratio
reaches over 10^8 at different temperatures. This effortlessly fabricated and
remarkably resilient diamond/Ga2O3 hetero-p-n-junction pioneers a novel pathway
for the exploration and fabrication of heterojunctions for ultra-wide bandgap
semiconductors with substantial lattice mismatch and different thermal
expansion coefficients.

<h3>Average negative heat in a non-Markovian bath</h3>

<i>Felix Ginot, Clemens Bechinger</i>
<p>We experimentally study the motion of a colloidal particle, translated back
and forth within a viscoelastic, i.e. non-Markovian bath. The particle starts
in equilibrium before the forward motion, but only partially relaxes at the
turning point. During the backward motion, we measure a systematic (negative)
heat flow from the bath to the particle. Our observations are in good agreement
with a simple model that describes the time-delayed response of the fluid. We
expect our results to be important for the realization and optimization of
novel types of micro-engines in non-Markovian surroundings.

<h3>Atomic Cluster Expansion for semilocal interactions beyond equivariant  message passing</h3>

<p>We extend the basis functions of the Atomic Cluster Expansion to graphs. This
naturally leads to a representation that enables us to describe semilocal

the graph Atomic Cluster Expansion recover the currently most accurate
message-passing representations of atomic interactions. We demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of our expansion for a number of small molecules,
clusters and a general-purpose model for carbon.

<h3>Evidence of Indium impurity band in superconducting (Sn,In)Te thin films</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiashu Wang, Trisha Musall, Bo-An Chen, Marie Gerges, Sylwia Ptasinska, Xinyu Liu, Badih A. Assaf</i>
<p>Sn1-xInxTe has been synthesized and studied recently as a candidate
topological superconductor. Its superconducting critical temperature increases
with Indium concentration. However, the role of Indium in altering the normal
state band structure and generating superconductivity is not well-understood.
Here, we explore this question in Sn1-xInxTe (0<x<0.3) thin films,
characterized by magneto-transport, infrared transmission and photoemission
spectroscopy measurement. We show that Indium is forming an impurity band below
the valence band edge which pins the Fermi energy and effectively generates
electron doping. An enhanced density-of-states due to this impurity band leads
to the enhancement of superconducting transition temperature measured in
multiple previous studies. The existence of the In impurity band and the role
of In as a resonant impurity should be more carefully considered when
discussing the topological nature of Sn1-xInxTe.

<h3>Zero-field spin wave turns</h3>

<i>Jan Klíma, Ondřej Wojewoda, Václav Roučka, Tomáš Molnár, Jakub Holobrádek, Michal Urbánek</i>
<p>Spin-wave computing, a potential successor to CMOS-based technologies, relies
on the efficient manipulation of spin waves for information processing. While
basic logic devices like magnon transistors, gates, and adders have been
experimentally demonstrated, the challenge for complex magnonic circuits lies
in steering spin waves through sharp turns. In this study we demonstrate with
micromagnetic simulations and Brillouin light scattering microscopy
experiments, that dipolar spin waves can propagate through 90-degree turns
without distortion. The key lies in carefully designed in-plane magnetization
landscapes, addressing challenges posed by anisotropic dispersion. The
experimental realization of the required magnetization landscape is enabled by
spatial manipulation of the uniaxial anisotropy using corrugated magnonic
waveguides. The findings presented in this work should be considered in any
magnonic circuit design dealing with anisotropic dispersion and spin wave
turns.

<h3>Coherent control of photomagnetic back-switching by double-pump laser  pulses</h3>

<i>T. Zalewski, L. Nowak, A. Stupakiewicz</i>
<p>The control of nonthermal, all-optical magnetization switching under the
regime with an independent state of laser polarization opens up new
opportunities for ultrafast magnetic recording. Here, we investigate the
photo-magnetic back-switching capabilities of the write and erase magnetic
domain pattern using double-pump pulse excitations in an iron garnet film with
pure cubic magnetocrystalline symmetry. It is essential to note that forward
and backward magnetization switching is achievable in two distinctive
scenarios: using identical linearly polarized laser pulses and with pulses
having orthogonal polarization planes. By observing the switch of magnetization
at domains independent of the initial state, one can nonthermally toggle the
magnetization, equivalent to XOR logical operation, at frequencies reaching up
to 50 GHz.

<h3>System-Environment Entanglement Phase Transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16343</a>
<br>
<i>Yuto Ashida, Shunsuke Furukawa, Masaki Oshikawa</i>
<p>Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena
governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase
transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the
entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we
consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and
analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes
are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the
R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent
term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical
description to relate the universal term to the $g$ function in a boundary
conformal field theory (CFT), and use the renormalization group (RG) method and
the boundary CFT techniques to determine its value. We show that the universal
contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity
signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the
size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement
strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We
argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously
irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted
Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in
the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement.
Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no
postselections, is discussed.

<h3>Magnetic Tunnel Junction Random Number Generators Applied to Dynamically  Tuned Probability Trees Driven by Spin Orbit Torque</h3>

<i>Andrew Maicke, Jared Arzate, Samuel Liu, Jaesuk Kwon, J. Darby Smith, James B. Aimone, Shashank Misra, Catherine Schuman, Suma G. Cardwell, Jean Anne C. Incorvia</i>
<p>Perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ)-based true-random number
generators (RNG) can consume orders of magnitude less energy per bit than CMOS
pseudo-RNG. Here, we numerically investigate with a macrospin
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation solver the use of pMTJs driven by spin-orbit
torque to directly sample numbers from arbitrary probability distributions with
the help of a tunable probability tree. The tree operates by dynamically
biasing sequences of pMTJ relaxation events, called 'coinflips', via an
additional applied spin-transfer-torque current. Specifically, using a single,
ideal pMTJ device we successfully draw integer samples on the interval 0,255
from an exponential distribution based on p-value distribution analysis. In
order to investigate device-to-device variations, the thermal stability of the
pMTJs are varied based on manufactured device data. It is found that while
repeatedly using a varied device inhibits ability to recover the probability
distribution, the device variations average out when considering the entire set
of devices as a 'bucket' to agnostically draw random numbers from. Further, it
is noted that the device variations most significantly impact the highest level
of the probability tree, iwth diminishing errors at lower levels. The devices
are then used to draw both uniformly and exponentially distributed numbers for
the Monte Carlo computation of a problem from particle transport, showing
excellent data fit with the analytical solution. Finally, the devices are
benchmarked against CMOS and memristor RNG, showing faster bit generation and
significantly lower energy use.

<h3>Entanglement Hamiltonian of a nonrelativistic Fermi gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16348</a>
<br>
<i>Viktor Eisler</i>
<p>We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for a spherical domain in the ground
state of a nonrelativistic free-fermion gas in arbitrary dimensions. Decomposed
into a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement
spectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear
potential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem
boundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential
operator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory.
Rescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect
approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta
that belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds
that the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one
dimension.

<h3>Microscopic Mechanism of the Thermal Amorphization of ZIF-4 and Melting  of ZIF-zni Revealed via Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16351" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16351</a>
<br>
<i>Emilio Mendez, Rocio Semino</i>
<p>We investigate the microscopic mechanism of the thermally induced ambient
pressure ordered-disordered phase transitions of two zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks of formula Zn(C$_3$H$_3$N$_2$)$_2$: a porous (ZIF-4) and a dense,
non-porous (ZIF-zni) polymorph via a combination of data science and computer
simulation approaches. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out at the
atomistic level through the nb-ZIF-FF force field that incorporates
ligand-metal reactivity and relies on dummy atoms to reproduce the correct
tetrahedral topology around Zn$^{2+}$ centres. The force field is capable of
reproducing the structure of ZIF-4, ZIF-zni and the amorphous (ZIF$\_$a) and
liquid (ZIF$\_$liq) phases that respectively result when these crystalline
materials are heated. Symmetry functions computed over a database of structures
of the four phases, are used as inputs to train a neural network that predicts
the probabilities of belonging to each of the four phases at the local
Zn$^{2+}$ level with 90$\%$ accuracy. We apply this methodology to follow the
time-evolution of the amorphization of ZIF-4 and the melting of ZIF-zni along a
series of molecular dynamics trajectories. We first computed the transition
temperature and determined associated thermodynamic state functions.
Subsequently, we studied the mechanisms. Both processes consist of two steps:
(i) for ZIF-4, a low-density amorphous phase is first formed, followed by the
final ZIF$\_$a phase while (ii) for ZIF-zni, a ZIF$\_$a-like phase precedes the
formation of the liquid phase. These processes involve connectivity changes in
the first neighbour ligands around the central Zn$^{2+}$ cations. We find that
the amorphization of ZIF-4 is a non-isotropic processes and we trace back the
origins of this anisotropic behaviour to density and lability of coordination
bonds.

<p>$\alpha$-Sn thin films can exhibit a variety of topologically non-trivial
phases. Both studying the transitions between these phases and making use of
these phases in eventual applications requires good control over the electronic
and structural quality of $\alpha$-Sn thin films. {$\alpha$}-Sn growth on InSb
often results in out-diffusion of indium, a p-type dopant. By growing
$\alpha$-Sn via molecular beam epitaxy on the Sb-rich c(4$\times$4) surface
reconstruction of InSb(001) rather than the In-rich c(8$\times$2), we
demonstrate a route to substantially decrease and minimize this indium
incorporation. The reduction in indium concentration allows for the study of
the surface and bulk Dirac nodes in $\alpha$-Sn via angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy without the common approaches of bulk doping or
surface dosing, simplifying topological phase identification. The lack of
indium incorporation is verified in angle-resolved and -integrated ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy as well as in clear changes in the Hall response.

<p>In this study, sub-angstrom spatial resolution is achieved in mapping and
spectroscopy of atoms and bonds within polygonal grain boundaries (GBs) of
graphite using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Robust van Hove
singularities (VHS) are observed in addition to edge states under ambient
conditions. The bias-dependent nature of these states reveals metallic traits
of GB, through the charge accumulation and dissipation of localized electronic
states. Utilizing a surface elastic deformation technique induced by STM tip
allows pico-pinching of the GB, providing insights into its mechanical strength
as well as in-situ strain-induced modification of their unique spectroscopy,
revealing a tendency toward flattening of the electronic energy band
dispersion. An initial atomic-level experimental technique of probing
spin-polarized magnetic states is demonstrated, suggesting different densities
for spin-up and spin-down states within a spin-degenerate band structure
potentially applicable in spin transport or quantum spin sensing.

<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the effect of external fields and currents on
electronic nematic orderings based on the concept of augmented multipoles
consisting of electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal
multipoles. We show the relation between rank-2 electric quadrupoles and the
other multipoles, the former of which corresponds to the microscopic order
parameter for the nematic phases. The electric (magnetic) field induces the
rank-1 and rank-3 electric (magnetic) multipoles and rank-2 electric toroidal
(magnetic toroidal) quadrupoles, while the electric current induces the rank-1
and rank-3 magnetic toroidal multipoles and rank-2 magnetic quadrupoles. We
classify the active multipoles under magnetic point groups, which will be a
reference to explore cross-correlation and transport phenomena in nematic
phases.

<p>Oxide semimetals exhibiting both nontrivial topological characteristics stand
as exemplary parent compounds and multiple degrees of freedom, offering great
promise for the realization of novel electronic states. In this study, we
present compelling evidence of profound structural and transport phase shifts
in a recently uncovered oxide semimetal, SrNbO3, achieved through effective
in-situ anion doping. Notably, a remarkable increase in resistivity of more
than three orders of magnitude at room temperature is observed upon
nitrogen-doping. The extent of electronic modulation in SrNbO3 is strongly
correlated with the misfit strain, underscoring its phase instability to both
chemical doping and crystallographic symmetry variations. Using
first-principles calculations, we discern that elevating the level of nitrogen
doping induces an upward shift in the conductive bands of SrNbO3-dNd.
Consequently, a transition from a metallic state to an insulating state becomes
apparent as the nitrogen concentration reaches a threshold of 1/3. This
investigation sheds light on the potential of anion engineering in oxide
semimetals, offering pathways for manipulating their physical properties. These
insights hold promise for future applications that harness these materials for
tailored functionalities.

<br>
<i>Pilkyung Moon, Youngwook Kim, Mikito Koshino, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jurgen H. Smet</i>
<p>Due to Landau quantization, the conductance of two-dimensional electrons
exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field exhibits oscillations that generate a
fan of linear trajectories when plotted in the parameter space spanned by
density and magnetic field. This fan looks identical irrespective of the
electron dispersion details that determines the field dependence of the Landau
level energy. This is no surprise, since the position of conductance minima
solely depends on the level degeneracy which is linear in flux. The fractal
energy spectrum that emerges within each Landau band when electrons are also
exposed to a two-dimensional superlattice potential produces numerous
additional oscillations, but they too create just linear fans for the same
reason. Here, we report on conductance oscillations of graphene electrons
exposed to a moir\'e potential that defy this general rule of flux linearity
and attribute the anomalous behavior to the simultaneous occupation of multiple
minibands and magnetic breakdown.

<h3>Unveiling Defect Physics in Gapped Metals: A Theoretical Investigation  into Defect Formation and Electronic Structure Interplay</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16448</a>
<br>
<i>Harshan Reddy Gopidi, Lovelesh Vashist, Oleksandr I. Malyi</i>
<p>In materials science, point defects play a crucial role in materials
properties. This is particularly well known for the wide band gap insulators
where the defect formation/compensation determines the equilibrium Fermi level
and generally the doping response of a given material. Similarly, the main
defect trends are also widely understood for regular metals (e.g., Cu and Zn
discussed herein). With the development of electronic structure theory, a
unique class of quantum materials - gapped metals (e.g., Ca6Al7O16, SrNbO3,
In15SnO24, and CaN2) that exhibit characteristics of both metals and insulators
- has been identified. While these materials have internal band gaps similar to
insulators, their Fermi level is within one of the main band edges, giving a
large intrinsic free carrier concentration. Such unique electronic structures
give rise to unique defect physics, where the formation of acceptor or donor
defect directly affects not only the electronic structure but also can
substantially shift the Fermi level. Motivated by this, herein, we develop a
fundamental first-principles theory of defect formation in gapped metal with a
primary focus on accurate calculations of defect formation energy. We
demonstrate that due to electron-hole recombination, the formation of acceptor
defects in n-type gapped metals results in significant dependence of defect
formation energy on supercell size, which we explain by the change of band
filling and its effect on the defect formation energetics. To accurately
describe defect formation energy, we revisit the phenomenology of band-filling
corrections and demonstrate the effect of this correction, accurate potential
alignment, and other factors that can affect defect energetics. Thus, this work
not only sheds light on the intrinsic properties of gapped metals but, in
general, establishes a theoretical foundation for analyzing defects in gapped
metals.

<h3>Revealing novel aspects of light-matter coupling in terahertz  two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy: the case of the amplitude mode in  superconductors</h3>

<i>Kota Katsumi, Jacopo Fiore, Mattia Udina, Ralph Romero III, David Barbalas, John Jesudasan, Pratap Raychaudhuri, Goetz Seibold, Lara Benfatto, N. P. Armitage</i>
<p>Recently developed terahertz (THz) two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy
(2DCS) is a powerful technique to obtain materials information in a fashion
qualitatively different from other spectroscopies. Here, we utilized THz 2DCS
to investigate the THz nonlinear response of conventional superconductor NbN.
Using broad-band THz pulses as light sources, we observed a third-order
nonlinear signal whose spectral components are peaked at twice the
superconducting gap energy $2\Delta$. With narrow-band THz pulses, a THz
nonlinear signal was identified at the driving frequency $\Omega$ and exhibited
a resonant enhancement at temperature when $\Omega = 2\Delta$. General
theoretical considerations show that such a resonance can only arise from a
disorder-activated paramagnetic coupling between the light and the electronic
current. This proves that the nonlinear THz response can access processes
distinct from the diamagnetic Raman-like density fluctuations, which are
believed to dominate the nonlinear response at optical frequencies in metals.
Our numerical simulations reveal that even for a small amount of disorder, the
$\Omega=2\Delta$ resonance is dominated by the superconducting amplitude mode
over the entire investigated disorder range. This is in contrast to other
resonances, whose amplitude-mode contribution depends on disorder. Our findings
demonstrate the unique ability of THz 2DCS to explore collective excitations
inaccessible in other spectroscopies.

Temperature phase diagrams of the model are obtained using numerical Monte

that local charge correlations contribute to an increased role of quantum

<p>Metal-insulator transition materials such as NbO2 have generated much
excitement in recent years for their potential applications in computing and
sensing. NbO2 has generated considerable debate over the nature of the phase
transition, and the values for the band gap/band widths in the insulating
phase. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of the band gap
and electronic structure of the insulating phase of NbO2. We carry out
ab-initio density functional theory plus U calculations, directly determining U
and J parameters for both the Nb 4d and O 2p subspaces through the recently
introduced minimum-tracking linear response method. We find a fundamental bulk
band gap of 0.80 eV for the full DFT+U+J theory. We also perform calculations
and measurements for a (100) oriented thin film. Scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy measurements show that the surface band gap varies from 0.75 eV to
1.35 eV due to an excess of oxygen in and near the surface region of the film.
Slab calculations indicate metallicity localised at the surface region caused
by an energy level shift consistent with a reduction in Coulomb repulsion. We
demonstrate that this effect in combination with the simple, low cost DFT+U+J
method can account for the band widths and p-d gap observed in X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Overall, our results indicate the
possible presence of a 2D anisotropic metallic layer at the (100) surface of
NbO2.

<p>In an extended superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S)
Josephson junction in a magnetic field, localized Majorana bound states (MBS)
are predicted to exist at the cores of Josephson vortices where the local phase
difference across the junction is an odd-multiple of $\pi$. These states
contribute a supercurrent with a $4\pi$-periodic current-phase relation (CPR)
that adds to the conventional $2\pi$-periodic sinusoidal CPR. In this work, we
present a comprehensive experimental study of the critical current vs. applied
magnetic field diffraction patterns of lateral Nb-Bi$_2$Se$_3$-Nb Josephson
junctions. We compare our observations to a model of the Josephson dynamics in
the S-TI-S junction system to explore what feature of MBS are, or are not,
exhibited in these junctions. Consistent with the model, we find several
distinct deviations from a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern that is expected for
a uniform sin$({\phi})$ CPR. In particular, we observe abrupt changes in the
diffraction pattern at applied magnetic fields in which the current-carrying
localized MBS are expected to enter the junction, and a lifting of the
odd-numbered nodes consistent with a $4\pi$-periodic sin$(\phi/2)$-component in
the CPR. We also see that although the even-numbered nodes often remain
fully-formed, we sometimes see deviations that are consistent with
quasiparticle-induced fluctuations in the parity of the MBS pairs that encodes
quantum information.

<p>Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers can serve as colloidal
quantum sensors of local fields in biological and chemical environments.
However, nanodiamond surfaces are challenging to modify without degrading their
colloidal stability or the NV center's optical and spin properties. Here, we
report a simple and general method to coat nanodiamonds with a thin emulsion
layer that preserves their quantum features, enhances their colloidal
stability, and provides functional groups for subsequent crosslinking and
click-chemistry conjugation reactions. To demonstrate this technique, we
decorate the nanodiamonds with combinations of carboxyl- and azide-terminated
amphiphiles that enable conjugation using two different strategies. We study
the effect of the emulsion layer on the NV center's spin lifetime, and we
quantify the nanodiamonds' chemical sensitivity to paramagnetic ions using
$T_1$ relaxometry. This general approach to nanodiamond surface
functionalization will enable advances in quantum nanomedicine and biological
sensing.

<i>Nikhil Gupt, Shuvadip Ghosh, Arnab Ghosh</i>
<p>We introduce a simplified model for a three-terminal quantum thermocouple
consisting of two strongly-coupled quantum dots. To elucidate spin-dependent
Seebeck and Peltier effects, we employ a microscopic Hamiltonian and map the
Lindblad master equation onto a quantum transition network, capturing the key
working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum
thermodynamic networks encompassing both Coulomb interaction and spin-flipping
processes, lead to the emergence of spin-thermolectric effects. Using algebraic
graph theory, we recover the phenomenological law of irreversible
thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate
expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager
reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises
in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition
network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles
across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different
basis from classical laws of irreversible thermodynamics relying on local
equilibrium assumptions.

<br>
<i>Guangpeng Sun, Liqiang zhang, Bin Wen</i>
<p>Precipitation strengthening is a key strengthening method for metallic
materials. However, the temperature effect on precipitation strengthening is
still unclear to date. Based on dislocation theory, a thermally-activated
precipitation strengthening model is built by considering the competition
between shear and bypass mechanisms. For medium-sized precipitate particles,
the thermally-activated shear mechanism dominates the precipitation
strengthening, resulting in a plateau region. While, for large or very fine
precipitate particles, the thermally-activated bypass mechanism dominates the
precipitation strengthening, leading to the strengthening or weakening regions.
Moreover, the effects of precipitate phase volume fraction, temperature, shear
modulus, strain rate, and mobile dislocation density on precipitation
strengthening are also investigated. This study not only provides new insights
into precipitation strengthening from the perspective of thermal activation but
also offers clear guidance for the design of new materials.

<p>Quantum fluctuations in low-dimensional systems and near quantum phase
transitions have significant influences on material properties. Yet, it is
difficult to experimentally gauge the strength and importance of quantum
fluctuations. Here we provide a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of
magnon excitations in Mott insulating cuprates. From the thin film of
SrCuO$_2$, single- and bi-magnon dispersions are derived. Using an effective
Heisenberg Hamiltonian generated from the Hubbard model, we show that the
single magnon dispersion is only described satisfactorily when including
significant renormalization stemming from quantum fluctuations. Comparative
results on La$_2$CuO$_4$ indicate that quantum fluctuations are much stronger
in SrCuO$_2$ suggesting closer proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point.
Monte Carlo calculations suggest an exotic incommensurate magnetic order as the
ground state that competes with the antiferromagnetic N\'eel order. Our results
indicate that SrCuO$_2$ -- due to strong quantum fluctuations -- is a unique
starting point for the exploration of novel magnetic ground states.

<p>Negative piezoelectrics contract in the direction of applied electric field,
which are opposite to normal piezoelectrics and rare in dielectric materials.
The raising of low dimensional ferroelectrics, with unconventional mechanisms
of polarity, opens a fertile branch for candidates with prominent negative
piezoelectricity. Here, the distorted $\alpha$-Bi monolayer, a newly-identified
elementary ferroelectric with puckered black phosphorous-like structure [J.
Guo, {\it et al}. Nature \textbf{617}, 67 (2023)], is computationally studied,
which manifests a large negative in-plane piezoelectricity (with
$d_{33}\sim-26$ pC/N). Its negative piezoelectricity originates from its unique
buckling ferroelectric mechanism, namely the inter-column sliding.
Consequently, a moderate tensile strain can significantly reduce its
ferroelectric switching energy barrier, while the compressive strain can
significantly enhance its prominent nonlinear optical response. The physical
mechanism of in-plane negative piezoelectricity also applies to other
elementary ferroeletric monolayers.

<br>
<i>Guo-Qing Gu, En-Bo Wei</i>
<p>A primitive problem of predicting the effective properties of composites is
open boundary conditions. In this paper, Eshelby's transformation field method
is developed to solve the open boundary problem of two-phase composites having
arbitrary inclusion geometry. The transformation fields are introduced in the
composite system to cope with the complicated interface boundary-value problem
of the composite. Furthermore, the open boundary problem is solved by Hermite
polynomial, which is used to express the transformation fields and the
perturbation fields. As an example, the formulas of Eshelby's method are
derived for calculating the effective dielectric property of two-dimensional
isotropic dielectric composites having open boundary conditions. The validity
of the method is verified by comparing the effective responses estimated by the
method with the exact solutions of dilute limit. The results show that the
method is valid to solve the open boundary problem of composites having complex
geometric inclusions.

<p>The geometric approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics is promising for
understanding the role of dissipation and thermodynamic trade-off relations.
This paper proposes a geometric framework for studying the nonequilibrium
thermodynamics of reaction-diffusion systems. Based on this framework, we
obtain several decompositions of the entropy production rate with respect to
conservativeness, spatial structure, and wavenumber. We also generalize optimal
transport theory to reaction-diffusion systems and derive several trade-off
relations, including thermodynamic speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty
relations. The thermodynamic trade-off relations obtained in this paper shed
light on thermodynamic dissipation in pattern formation. We numerically
demonstrate our results using the

<p>The proximity effect at a highly transparent interface of an s-wave
superconductor (S) and a topological insulator (TI) provides a promising
platform to create Majorana zero modes in artificially designed
heterostructures. However, structural and chemical issues pertinent to such
interfaces are poorly explored so far. Here, we report the discovery of Pd
diffusion induced polarization at interfaces between superconductive
Pd$_{1+x}$(Bi$_{0.4}$Te$_{0.6}$)$_2$ (xPBT, $0\le x \le 1$) and Pd-intercalated
Bi$_2$Te$_3$ by using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy. Our quantitative image analysis reveals that nanoscale lattice
strain and QL polarity synergistically suppress and promote the Pd diffusion at
the normal and parallel interfaces, formed between Te-Pd-Bi triple layers (TLs)
and Te-Bi-Te-Bi-Te quintuple layers (QLs), respectively. Further, our
first-principles calculations unveil that the superconductivity of xPBT phase
and topological nature of Pd-intercalated Bi$_2$Te$_3$ phase are robust against
the broken inversion symmetry. These findings point out the necessity of
considering coexistence of electric polarization with superconductivity and
topology in such S-TI systems.

<p>Study of boundary phase transition in toric code under cylinder geometry via

measurements for bulk qubits is increased, spin-glass type long-range order on
the boundaries emerges indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $Z_2$

transition to Higgs phase with symmetry protected topological order. We

its criticality and give a physical picture using a non-local gauge invariant
symmetry operator. Phase transition in the bulk is also studied and its
relationship to the boundary transition is discussed.

<p>Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as an exciting condensed-matter quantum

Notable progress has been witnessed, but such correlated states are achievable
usually at low temperatures. Here, we report the transport evidences of
room-temperature correlated electronic states and layer-hybridized SU(4)
Hubbard model simulator in AB-stacked MoS$_2$ homo-bilayer moir\'e
superlattices. Correlated insulating states at moir\'e band filling factors v =
1, 2, 3 are unambiguously established in twisted bilayer MoS$_2$. Remarkably,
the correlated electronic states can persist up to a record-high critical
temperature of over 285 K. The realization of room-temperature correlated
states in twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ can be understood as the cooperation effects
of the stacking-specific atomic reconstruction and the resonantly enhanced
interlayer hybridization, which largely amplify the moir\'e superlattice
effects on electronic correlations. Furthermore, extreme large non-linear Hall
responses up to room-temperature are uncovered near correlated insulating

<h3>Deriving quantum spin model for a zigzag-chain ytterbium magnet with  anisotropic exchange interactions</h3>

<i>Hidehiro Saito, Hiroki Nakai, Chisa Hotta</i>
<p>We derive a quantum spin Hamiltonian of the spin-1/2 zigzag chain realized in
a rare earth ytterbium-based magnetic insulator, YbCuS2. This material
undergoes a transition at 0.95K to an incommensurate magnetic phase with small
moments, which does not conform to the nonmagnetic singlet ground state of the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg model. We take account of octahedral crystal field effect,
atomic spin-orbit coupling, and strong Coulomb interactions on Yb ions, and
perform a four-order perturbation theory to evaluate the superexchange coupling
constants. A small but finite anisotropic exchange coupling called
{\Gamma}-term appears similarly to the case reported previously in other
triangular-based magnets. By varying several material parameters, we figure out
two important factors to enhance {\Gamma}-term. One is the splitting of excited
f-states with two holes, which efficiently selects the perturbation terms
associated with the lowest excited state having large total angular momentum,
and accordingly with high spatial anisotropy. The other is the tilting of
octahedra or distortion of S-Yb-S bond angle, which break the symmetry of the
Slater-Koster overlap. These effects are systematically analyzed by the
exchange anisotropy in units of pairs of octahedra within the local spin frame,
which significantly reduces the complexity of directly referring to the
Hamiltonian discussed in the global axis.

<p>Finding the best strategy to minimize the time needed to find a given target
is a crucial task both in nature and in reaching decisive technological
advances. By considering learning agents able to switch their dynamics between
standard and active Brownian motion, here we focus on developing effective
target-search behavioral policies for microswimmers navigating a homogeneous
environment and searching for targets of unknown position. We exploit
Projective Simulation, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to acquire an
efficient stochastic policy represented by the probability of switching the
phase, i.e. the navigation mode, in response to the type and the duration of
the current phase. Our findings reveal that the target-search efficiency
increases with the particle's self-propulsion during the active phase and that,
while the optimal duration of the passive case decreases monotonically with the
activity, the optimal duration of the active phase displays a non-monotonic
behavior.

<p>Highlighted with improved long-term thermal and environmental stability,
all-inorganic metal halide perovskites exhibit tunable physical properties,
cost-effective synthesis, and satisfactory optoelectronic performance,
attracting increasing research interests worldwide. However, a less explored
feature of these materials is their strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which is
the hidden force influencing not only band structure but also properties
including magnetoresistance, spin lifetime and singlet-triplet splitting. This
review provides an overview of the fundamental aspects and the latest progress
of the SOC and debate regarding Rashba effects in all-inorganic metal halide
perovskites, providing critical insights into the physical phenomena and
potential applications. Meanwhile, crystal structures and photophysics of
all-inorganic perovskite are discussed in the context of SOC, along with the
related experimental and characterization techniques. Furthermore, a recent
understanding of the band topology in the all-inorganic halide perovskites is
introduced to push the boundary even further for the novel applications of
all-inorganic halide perovskites. Finally, an outlook is given on the potential

<h3>Superfluid Fraction and Leggett Bound in a Density Modulated Strongly  Interacting Fermi Gas at Zero Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16709</a>
<br>
<i>Giuliano Orso, Sandro Stringari</i>
<p>We calculate the superfluid fraction of an interacting Fermi gas, in the
presence of a one-dimensional periodic potential of strength $V_0$ and
wave-vector $q$. Special focus is given to the unitary Fermi gas, characterized
by the divergent behavior of the s-wave scattering length. Comparison with the
Leggett's upper bound $(\langle n_{1D}\rangle <1/n_{1D}>)^{-1}$, with $n_{1D}$
the 1D column density, explicitly shows that, differently from the case of a
dilute interacting Bose gas, the bound significantly overestimates the value of
the superfluid fraction, except in the phonon regime of small $q$. Sum rule
arguments show that the combined knowledge of the Leggett bound and of the
actual value of the superfluid fraction allows for the determination of
curvature effects providing the deviation of the dispersion of the
Anderson-Bogoliubov mode from the linear phonon dependence. The comparison with
the predictions of the weakly interacting BCS Fermi gas points out the crucial
role of two-body interactions. The implications of our predictions on the
anisotropic behavior of the sound velocity are also discussed.

<h3>Rheology of granular particles immersed in a molecular gas under uniform  shear flow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16717" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16717</a>
<br>
<i>Rubén Gómez González, Moisés García Chamorro, Vicente Garzó</i>
<p>Non-Newtonian transport properties of a dilute gas of inelastic hard spheres
immersed in a molecular gas are determined. We assume that the granular gas is
sufficiently rarefied and hence, the state of the molecular gas is not
disturbed by the presence of the solid particles. In this situation, one can
treat the molecular gas as a bath (or thermostat) of elastic hard spheres at a
given temperature. Moreover, in spite of the fact that the number density of
grains is quite small, we take into account their inelastic collisions among
themselves in its kinetic equation. The system (granular gas plus a bath of
elastic hard spheres) is subjected to a simple (or uniform) shear flow (USF).
In the low-density regime, the rheological properties of the granular gas are
determined by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation by means of Grad's moment
method. These properties turn out to be highly nonlinear functions of the shear
rate and the remaining parameters of the system. Our results show that the
kinetic granular temperature and the non-Newtonian viscosity present a
discontinuous shear thickening (DST) effect for sufficiently high values of the
mass ratio $m/m_g$ ($m$ and $m_g$ being the mass of grains and gas particles,
respectively). This effect becomes more pronounced as the mass ratio $m/m_g$
increases. In particular, in the Brownian limit ($m_g/m\to 0$) the expressions
of the non-Newtonian transport properties derived here are consistent with
those previously obtained by considering a coarse-grained approach where the
effect of gas phase on grains is through an effective force. Theoretical
results are compared against computer simulations in the Brownian limit showing
an excellent agreement.

<i>Manuel Müller, Johannes Weber, Sebastian T.B. Goennenwein, S. Viola Kusminskiy, Rudolf Gross, Matthias Althammer, Hans Huebl</i>
<p>Tailored magnon-phonon hybrid systems, where high overtone bulk acoustic
resonators couple resonantly to the magnonic mode of a ferromagnetic thin film,
are considered optimal for the creation of acoustic phonons with a defined
circular polarization. This class of devices is therefore ideal for the
investigation of phonon propagation properties and assessing their capacity to
transport angular momentum in the classical and potentially even in the quantum
regime. Here, we study the coupling between the magnons in a ferromagnetic
\ch{Co25Fe75} thin film and the transverse acoustic phonons in a bulk acoustic
wave resonators formed by the sapphire substrate onto which the film is
deposited. Using broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiments as a function of
temperature, we investigate the strength of the coherent magnon-phonon
interaction and the individual damping rates of the magnons and phonons
participating in the process. This demonstrates that this coupled magnon-phonon
system can reach a cooperativity $C\approx 1$ at cryogenic temperatures. Our
experiments also showcase the potential of strongly coupled magnon-phonon
systems for strain sensing applications.

<h3>Sluggish and Chemically-Biased Interstitial Diffusion in Concentrated  Solid Solution Alloys: Mechanisms and Methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16727" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16727</a>
<br>
<i>Biao Xu, Haijun Fu, Shasha Huang, Shihua Ma, Yaoxu Xiong, Jun Zhang, Xuepeng Xiang, Wenyu Lu, Ji-Jung Kai, Shijun Zhao</i>
<p>Interstitial diffusion is a pivotal process that governs the phase stability
and irradiation response of materials in non-equilibrium conditions. In this
work, we study sluggish and chemically-biased interstitial diffusion in Fe-Ni
concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) by combining machine learning (ML)
and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC), where ML is used to accurately and efficiently
predict the migration energy barriers on-the-fly. The ML-kMC reproduces the
diffusivity that was reported by molecular dynamics results at high
temperatures. With this powerful tool, we find that the observed sluggish
diffusion and the "Ni-Ni-Ni"-biased diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys are ascribed to a
unique "Barrier Lock" mechanism, whereas the "Fe-Fe-Fe"-biased diffusion is
influenced by a "Component Dominance" mechanism. Inspired by the mentioned
mechanisms, a practical AvgS-kMC method is proposed for conveniently and
swiftly determining interstitial-mediated diffusivity by only relying on the
mean energy barriers of migration patterns. Combining the AvgS-kMC with the
differential evolutionary algorithm, an inverse design strategy for optimizing
sluggish diffusion properties is applied to emphasize the crucial role of
favorable migration patterns.

<p>Networks of nanowires and nanosheets are important for many applications in
printed electronics. However, the network conductivity and mobility are usually
limited by the inter-particle junction resistance, a property that is
challenging to minimise because it is difficult to measure. Here, we develop a
simple model for conduction in networks of 1D or 2D nanomaterials, which allows
us to extract junction and nanoparticle resistances from
particle-size-dependent D.C. resistivity data of conducting and semiconducting
materials. We find junction resistances in porous networks to scale with
nanoparticle resistivity and vary from 5 Ohm for silver nanosheets to 25 GOhm
for WS2 nanosheets. Moreover, our model allows junction and nanoparticle
resistances to be extracted from A.C. impedance spectra of semiconducting
networks. Impedance data links the high mobility (~7 cm2/Vs) of aligned
networks of electrochemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets to low junction
resistances of ~670 kOhm. Temperature-dependent impedance measurements allow us
to quantitatively differentiate intra-nanosheet phonon-limited band-like
transport from inter-nanosheet hopping for the first time.

<h3>Heat Pulses in Electron Quantum Optics</h3>

<br>
<i>Pedro Portugal, Fredrik Brange, Christian Flindt</i>
<p>Electron quantum optics aims to realize ideas from the quantum theory of
light with the role of photons being played by charge pulses in electronic
conductors. Experimentally, the charge pulses are excited by time-dependent
voltages, however, one could also generate heat pulses by heating and cooling
an electrode. Here, we explore this intriguing idea by formulating a Floquet
scattering theory of heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors. The adiabatic
emission of heat pulses leads to a heat current that in linear response is
given by the thermal conductance quantum. However, we also find a
high-frequency component, which ensures that the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem for heat currents, whose validity has been debated, is fulfilled. The
heat pulses are uncharged, and we probe their electron-hole content by
evaluating the partition noise in the outputs of a quantum point contact. We
also employ a Hong--Ou--Mandel setup to examine if the pulses bunch or
antibunch. Finally, to generate an electric current, we use a Mach--Zehnder
interferometer that breaks the electron-hole symmetry and thereby enables a
thermoelectric effect. Our work paves the way for systematic investigations of
heat pulses in mesoscopic conductors, and it may stimulate future experiments.

<p>The manifold of the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is always
considered to be a torus. However, under the synthetic gauge field, the
Brillouin manifold can be modified by the projective symmetries, resulting in
unprecedented topological properties. Here, we realize a real-projective-plane
hybrid-order topological insulator in a phononic crystal by introducing the Z_2
gauge field. Such insulator hosts two momentum-space non-symmorphic reflection
symmetries, which change the Brillouin manifold from a torus to a real
projective plane. These symmetries can simultaneously lead to Klein-bottle and
quadrupole topologies in different bulk gaps. The non-symmorphic reflection
symmetries on Brillouin real projective plane, edge states of Klein-bottle
insulator, and corner states of quadrupole insulator are observed. These
results evidence the hybrid-order topology on Brillouin manifold beyond the
torus, and enrich the topological physics.

<p>Recent advances in the field of quantum technologies have opened up the road
for the realization of small-scale quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories
which, among other goals, aim at improving our understanding on the
non-perturbative mechanisms underlying the confinement of quarks. In this work,
considering periodically-driven arrays of Rydberg atoms in a tweezer ladder
geometry, we devise a scalable Floquet scheme for the quantum simulation of the
real-time dynamics in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. Resorting to an external magnetic
field to tune the angular dependence of the Rydberg dipolar interactions, and
by a suitable tuning of the driving parameters, we manage to suppress the main
gauge-violating terms, and show that an observation of gauge-invariant
confinement dynamics in the Floquet-Rydberg setup is at reach of current
experimental techniques. Depending on the lattice size, we present a thorough
numerical test of the validity of this scheme using either exact
diagonalization or matrix-product-state algorithms for the
periodically-modulated real-time dynamics.

<h3>Transport properties of a half-filled Chern band at the electron and  composite fermion phases</h3>

<br>
<i>Ady Stern, Liang Fu</i>
<p>We consider a half-filled Chern band and its transport properties in two
phases that it may form, the electronic Fermi liquid and the composite-fermion
Fermi liquid. For weak disorder, we show that the Hall resistivity for the
former phase is very small, while for the latter it is close to $2h/e^2$,
independent of the distribution of the Berry curvature in the band. At rising
temperature and high frequency, we expect the Hall resistivity of the
electronic phase to rise, and that of the composite-fermion phase to deviate
from $2h/e^2$. At high frequency, sign changes are expected as well.
Considering high-frequency transport, we show that the composite fermion phase
carries a gapped plasmon mode which does not originate from long ranged Coulomb
interaction, and we show how this mode, together with the reflection of
electro-magnetic waves off the Chern band, allow for a measurement of the
composite-fermion Drude weight and Berry curvature. Finally, we consider a
scenario of a mixed-phase transition between the two phases, for example as a
function of displacement-field, and show that such transition involves an
enhancement of the longitudinal resistivity, as observed experimentally.

<p>Atomic structure and electronic band structure are fundamental properties for
understanding the mechanism of superconductivity. Motivated by the discovery of
pressure-induced high-temperature superconductivity at 80 K in the bilayer
Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7, the atomic structure and electronic band
structure of the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 under pressure up to 44.3 GPa
were investigated. A structural transition from the monoclinic P21/a space
group to the tetragonal I4/mmm around 12.6-13.4 GPa was identified. Density
functional theory calculations suggest that the bonding state of Ni 3dz2
orbital rises and crosses the Fermi level at high pressures, which may give
rise to possible superconductivity observed in resistance under pressure in
La4Ni3O10. The trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 shows some similarities with the
bilayer La3Ni2O7 and has its unique properties, providing a new platform to
investigate the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in nickelates.

<h3>Local distortions of the crystal structure and their influence on the  electronic structure and superconductivity of (TaNb)0.67(HfZrTi)0.33  high-entropy alloy</h3>

<br>
<i>Kinga Jasiewicz, Janusz Tobola, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</i>
<p>Local distortions of the crystal structure and their influence on the
electronic structure, electron-phonon interaction, and superconductivity are
theoretically studied in the superconducting high-entropy alloy (HEA)
(TaNb)$_{0.67}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.33}$. Distortions of the crystal lattice are caused
by the relaxation of atomic positions and are studied in the twelve models of
supercells. The largest relative changes in the interatomic distances due to
relaxation reach 8\%. On average, local distortions tend to lower the density
of states at the Fermi level and significantly reduce the electron-phonon
coupling parameter $\lambda$. As a result, the calculated superconducting
critical temperature is reduced to about 50\% of the initial value, which shows
the strong impact of structural disorder on superconductivity in this prototype
high-entropy alloy. With the reduced value of $\lambda$, the theoretical $T_c$
is closer to the experiment for typical values of the Columomb pseudopotential
parameter $\mu^*$. The experimental $T_c$ can be reproduced by taking a
slightly enhanced $\mu^* = 0.176$, which leaves little room for the possibility
of suppression of superconductivity by disorder.

<br>
<i>Henry A. Lockwood, Molly Agar, Suzanne M. Fielding</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experiments studying the creep and breakup of a protein
gel under stress, we introduce a simple mesoscopic model for the irreversible
failure of gels and fibrous materials, and demonstrate it to capture much of
the phenomenology seen experimentally. This includes a primary creep regime in
which the shear rate decreases as a power law over several decades of time, a
secondary crossover regime in which the shear rate attains a minimum, and a
tertiary regime in which the shear rate increases dramatically up to a finite
time singularity, signifying irreversible material failure. The model also
captures a linear Monkman-Grant scaling of the failure time with the earlier
time at which the shear rate attained its minimum, and a Basquin-like power law
scaling of the failure time with imposed stress, as seen experimentally. The
model furthermore predicts a slow accumulation of low levels of material damage
during primary creep, followed by the growth of fractures leading to sudden
material failure, as seen experimentally.

<i>Eugen Dizer, Jan Horak, Jan M. Pawlowski</i>
<p>We calculate non-perturbative self-consistent fermionic and bosonic spectral
functions of ultra-cold Fermi gases with the spectral functional approach. This
approach allows for a direct real-time computation of non-perturbative
correlation functions, and in the present work we use spectral Dyson-Schwinger
equations. We focus on the normal phase of the spin-balanced Fermi gas and
provide numerical results for the full fermionic and bosonic spectral
functions. The spectral functions are then used for the determination of the
equation of state, the Tan contact and ejection rf spectra at unitarity. These
results are compared to experimental data, the self-consistent T-matrix
approach and lattice results. Our approach offers a wide range of applications,
including the ab initio calculation of transport and spectral properties of the
superfluid phase in the BCS-BEC crossover.

<i>Nicolas Rougemaille, Johann Coraux</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials naturally form moir\'{e} patterns with other
crystalline layers, such as other 2D material or the surface of a substrate.
These patterns add a nanoscale characteristic length in the form of a
superlattice: the moir\'{e} wavelength. Understanding the origin and
characteristics of these patterns is crucial to design/interpret
moir\'{e}-induced physical properties. Here, we use a mixed continuum mechanics
+ atomistic modeling to study two experimentally relevant epitaxial 2D
materials -- graphene on Ir(111) and MoS$_2$ on Au(111) -- under extrinsic and
intrinsic strain. We consider three different scenarios affecting substantially
the lattice constant of the 2D materials, the wavelength and corrugation of the
moir\'{e} pattern. (i) Under the influence of the interaction with the
substrate, bending energy produces non trivial variations of the moir\'{e}
properties, even when the strain is small; (ii) When locked on a progressively
strained substrate via the valleys of the moir\'{e}, the membranes'
nanorippling amplitude goes through several jumps related to relatively smaller
jumps in the interatomic distance of the 2D materials; (iii) Finally,
increasing the zero-deformation value of this interatomic distance (possibly
controlable with temperature or illumination in experiments) the moir\'{e}
wavelength can either increase or decrease.

<p>Intensive research has focused on harnessing the potential of graphene for
electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices by generating a bandgap at
the Dirac point and enhancing the spin-orbit interaction in the graphene layer.
Proximity to heavy p elements is a promising approach; however, their
interaction in graphene heterostructures has not been as intensively studied as
that of ferromagnetic, noble, or heavy d metals, neither as interlayers nor as
substrates. In this study, the effective intercalation of Te atoms in a
graphene on Ir(111) heterostructure is achieved. Combining techniques such as
low energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, the
structural evolution of the system as a function of the Te coverage is
elucidated, uncovering up to two distinct phases. The presented angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy analysis reveals the emergence of a bandgap of about
240 meV in the Dirac cone at room temperature, which preserves its
characteristic linear dispersion. Furthermore, a pronounced n-doping effect
induced by Te in the heterostructure is also observed, and remarkably the
possibility of tuning the Dirac point energy towards the Fermi level by
reducing the Te coverage while maintaining the open bandgap is demonstrated.
Spin-resolved measurements unveil a non-planar chiral spin texture with
significant splitting values for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin
components. These experimental findings are consistent with the development of
a quantum spin Hall phase, where a Te-enhanced intrinsic spin orbit coupling in
graphene surpasses the Rashba one and promotes the opening of the spin-orbit
bandgap.

<p>Symmetry breaking governs most fascinating phenomena in crystals, such as
ferroelectricity, nonlinear optics, piezoelectricity, ferromagnetism, and
superconductivity. In two-dimensional materials, a wide variety of tuning knobs
presents extraordinary opportunities for engineering symmetry breaking, leading
to the emergence and manipulation of novel physical properties. Recently,
tetralayer graphene with ABCB stacking order is predicted to possess atypical
elemental ferroelectricity arising from the symmetry breaking induced by its
specific stacking configuration. Experimentally unveiling the stacking-order
dependent symmetry in tetralayer graphene is crucial to understand the
intricate properties in the emergent graphene allotropes. Here, we observe
pronounced nonlinear optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in ABCB-stacked
tetralayer graphene, but absent in both ABAB- and ABCA-stacked allotropes. Our
results provide direct evidence of symmetry breaking in ABCB-stacked tetralayer
graphene. The remarkable contrast in the SHG spectra of tetralayer graphene
allows straightforward identification of ABCB domains from the other two kinds
of stacking order and facilitates the characterization of their crystalline
orientation. The employed SHG technique serves as a convenient tool for
exploring the intriguing physics and novel nonlinear optics in ABCB-stacked
graphene, where spontaneous polarization and intrinsic gapped flat bands
coexist. Our results establish ABCB-stacked graphene as a unique platform for

<p>The one-to-one relation between the winding number and the number of robust

<p>The plasmonic tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is functionalized
with a single fluorescent molecule and is scanned on a plasmonic substrate. The
tunneling current flowing through the tip-molecule-substrate junction generates
a narrow-line emission of light corresponding to the fluorescence of the
negatively charged molecule suspended at the apex of the tip, i.e., the
emission of the excited molecular anion (trion). The fluorescence of this
molecular probe is recorded for tip-substrate nanocavities featuring different
plasmonic resonances, for different tip-substrate distances and applied bias
voltages, and on different substrates. We demonstrate that the width of the
emission peak can be used as a probe of the trion-plasmon coupling strength and
that the energy of the emitted photons is governed by the molecule interactions
with its electrostatic environment. Additionally, we theoretically elucidate
why the direct contact of the suspended molecule with the metallic tip does not
totally quench the radiative emission of the molecule.

multiple Andreev reflections are observed. A perpendicular magnetic field
causes interference patterns of the switching current, exhibiting
Fraunhofer-like and SQUID-like behaviors. We further demonstrate a prototype
device for Majorana detection, wherein phase bias and tunneling spectroscopy
are applicable.

<h3>Acquisition of high-quality three-dimensional electron diffuse  scattering data</h3>

<br>
<i>Romy Poppe, Joke Hadermann</i>
<p>The diffraction patterns of crystalline materials with local order contain
sharp Bragg reflections as well as highly structured diffuse scattering. The
instrumental requirements, experimental parameters and data processing
techniques for obtaining high-quality diffuse scattering data have previously
been determined for X-ray and neutron diffraction, but not yet for electron
diffraction. In this study, we show that the spatial resolution of the diffuse
scattering in three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data depends on
various effects, including the convergence of the electron beam, the point
spread function of the detector and the crystal mosaicity. In contrast to
single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the detector point spread function for 3D ED
is broader for a hybrid pixel detector than for a CCD. In our study, we also
compare the diffuse scattering in 3D ED data with the diffuse scattering in
single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and show that the diffuse scattering in
3D ED data can be obtained with a quality comparable to that from
single-crystal X-ray diffraction. As electron diffraction requires much smaller
crystal sizes than X-ray diffraction, this opens up the possibility to
investigate the local structure of many technologically relevant materials for
which no crystals large enough for single-crystal X-ray diffraction are
available.

<h3>Engineering Ratchet-Based Particle Separation via Shortcuts to  Isothermality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16823" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16823</a>
<br>
<i>Xiu-Hua Zhao, Z. C. Tu, Yu-Han Ma</i>
<p>Microscopic particle separation plays vital role in various scientific and
industrial domains. In this Letter, we propose a universal non-equilibrium
thermodynamic approach, employing the concept of Shortcuts to Isothermality, to
realize controllable separation of overdamped Brownian particles. By utilizing
a designed ratchet potential with temporal period $\tau$, we find in the
slow-driving regime that the average particle velocity
$\Bar{v}_s\propto\left(1-D/D^*\right)\tau^{-1}$, indicating that particles with
different diffusion coefficients $D$ can be guided to move in distinct
directions with a preset $D^*$. Furthermore, we reveal that there exists an
extra energetic cost with a lower bound
$W_{\rm{ex}}^{(\rm{min})}\propto\mathcal{L}^{2}\Bar{v}_s$, alongside a
quasi-static work consumption. Here, $\mathcal{L}$ is the thermodynamic length
of the driving loop in the parametric space. We numerically validate our
theoretical findings and illustrate the optimal separation protocol (associated
with $W_{\rm{ex}}^{(\rm{min})}$) with a sawtooth potential. This study
establishes a bridge between thermodynamic process engineering and particle
separation, paving the way for further explorations of thermodynamic constrains
and optimal control in ratchet-based particle separation.

<h3>Acoustic lattice instabilities at the magneto-structural transition in  Fe$_{1.057(7)}$Te</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16853</a>
<br>
<i>K. Guratinder, E. Chan, E. E. Rodriguez, J. A. Rodriguez-Rivera, U. Stuhr, A. Stunault, N. Qureshi, C. Stock</i>
<p>Fe$_{1.057(7)}$Te undergoes a first-order tetragonal to monoclinc structural
transition at T$_{S} \sim 70$ K, breaking the C$_{4}$ lattice symmetry and
simultaneously breaking time reversal symmetry with bicollinear magnetic order.
We investigate the soft acoustic lattice dynamics near this combined
magneto-structural transition. We apply spherically neutron polarimetry to
study the static magnetism near this transition, characterized with x-ray
powder diffraction, and find no evidence of static incommensurate magnetic
correlations near the onset of monoclinic and bicollinear antiferromagnetic
order. This fixes the position of our single crystal sample in the Fe$_{1+x}$Te
phase diagram in the magnetic bicollinear region and illustrates that our
sample statically undergoes a transition from a paramagnetic phase to a
low-temperature bicollinear phase. We then apply neutron spectroscopy to study
the acoustic phonons, related to elastic deformations of the lattice. We find a
temperature dependent soft acoustic branch for phonons propagating along [010]
and polarized along [100]. The slope of this acoustic phonon branch is
sensitive to the elastic constant $C_{66}$ and the shear modulus. The
temperature dependence of this branch displays a softening with a minimum near
the magneto-structural transition of T$_{S}$ $\sim$ 70 K and a recovery within
the magnetically ordered low temperature phase. Soft acoustic instabilities are
present in the collinear phases of the chalcogenides Fe$_{1+x}$Te where nematic
order found in Fe$_{1+\delta}$Se is absent. We speculate, based on localized
single-ion magnetism, that the relative energy scale of magnetic spin-orbital
coupling on the Fe$^{2+}$ transition metal ion is important for the presence of
a nematicity in the chalcogenides.

<h3>Electronic Lieb lattice signatures embedded in two-dimensional polymers  with square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16858" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16858</a>
<br>
<i>Yingying Zhang, Shuangjie Zhao, Miroslav Položij, Thomas Heine</i>
<p>Exotic band features, such as Dirac cones and flat bands, arise directly from
the lattice symmetry of materials. The Lieb lattice is one of the most
intriguing topologies, because it possesses both Dirac cones and flat bands
which intersect at the Fermi level. However, materials with Lieb lattice remain
experimentally unreached. Here, we explore two-dimensional poly-mers (2DPs)
derived from zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) building blocks with a square lattice
(sql) as potential electronic Lieb lattice materials. By systematically varying
the linker lengths (ZnPc-xP), we found that some ZnPc-xP exhibit a
characteristic Lieb lattice band structure. Interestingly though, fes bands are
also observed in ZnPc-xP. The coexistence of fes and Lieb in sql 2DPs
challenges the conventional perception of the structure-electronic structure
relation. In addition, we show that manipula-tion of the Fermi level, achieved
by electron removal or atom substitution, effectively preserves the unique
characteristics of Lieb bands. Chern number calculations confirm the
non-trivial nature of the Lieb Dirac bands. Our discoveries provide a fresh
perspective on 2D polymers and redefine the search for Lieb lattice materials
into a well-defined chemical synthesis task.

<h3>Two-dimensional Asymptotic Generalized Brillouin Zone Conjecture</h3>

<br>
<i>Zeqi Xu, Bo Pang, Kai Zhang, Zhesen Yang</i>
<p>The development of a generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) theory capable of
describing the two-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a pivotal
subject in non-Hermitian physics. In this study, we propose a conjecture on the
two-dimensional GBZ theory by resolving a minimal non-trivial model.
Specifically, we conjecture that for any given open boundary eigenvalue $E_0$,
its corresponding two-dimensional GBZ is primarily determined by a series of
geometry-independent non-Bloch Fermi points and geometry-dependent non-Bloch
equal frequency contours that connect them. A corollary of our conjecture is
that for any given non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the corresponding region covered
by its open boundary spectrum on the complex energy plane should be independent
of the open boundary geometry.

<h3>Dynamical Mean Field Theory of the Bilayer Hubbard Model with Inchworm  Monte Carlo</h3>

<br>
<i>Dolev Goldberger, Yehonatan Fridman, Emanuel Gull, Eitan Eidelstein, Guy Cohen</i>
<p>Dynamical mean-field theory allows access to the physics of strongly
correlated materials with nontrivial orbital structure, but relies on the
ability to solve auxiliary multi-orbital impurity problems. The most successful
approaches to date for solving these impurity problems are the various
continuous time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Here, we consider perhaps the
simplest realization of multi-orbital physics: the bilayer Hubbard model on an
infinite-coordination Bethe lattice. Despite its simplicity, the majority of
this model's phase diagram cannot be predicted by using traditional Monte Carlo
methods. We show that these limitations can be largely circumvented by recently
introduced Inchworm Monte Carlo techniques. We then explore the model's phase
diagram at a variety of interaction strengths, temperatures and filling ratios.

<h3>Transformer Wave Function for the Shastry-Sutherland Model: emergence of  a Spin-Liquid Phase</h3>

<br>
<i>Luciano Loris Viteritti, Riccardo Rende, Alberto Parola, Sebastian Goldt, Federico Becca</i>
<p>Quantum magnetism in two-dimensional systems represents a lively branch of
modern condensed-matter physics. In the presence of competing super-exchange
couplings, magnetic order is frustrated and can be suppressed down to zero
temperature, leading to exotic ground states. The Shastry-Sutherland model,
describing $S=1/2$ degrees of freedom interacting in a two-dimensional lattice,
portrays a simple example of highly-frustrated magnetism, capturing the
low-temperature behavior of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ with its intriguing
properties. Here, we investigate this problem by using a Vision Transformer to
define an extremely accurate variational wave function. From a technical side,
a pivotal achievement relies on using complex-valued parameters only in a
single output layer, while the bulk of the Transformer is defined with
real-valued ones. From the physical side, we supply strong evidence for the
stabilization of a spin-liquid between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic
phases. Our findings underscore the potential of Neural Network Quantum States
as a valuable tool for probing uncharted phases of matter, opening
opportunities to establish the properties of many-body systems.

<h3>Disordered ground state in the spin-orbit coupled $J_{\rm eff}= 1/2$  cobalt-based metal-organic framework magnet with orthogonal spin dimers</h3>

<br>
<i>Sebin J. Sebastian, S. Mohanty, A. Nath, M. P. Saravanan, S. Mandal, A. A. Tsirlin, R. Nath</i>
<p>We present the magnetic properties of a strongly spin-orbit coupled quantum
dimer magnet based on Co$^{2+}$. The metal-organic framework compound
Co$_2$(BDC)$_2$(DPTTZ)$_2$$\cdot$DMF features Co$^{2+}$ dimers arranged nearly
orthogonal to each other, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Our
assessment based on the magnetization and heat capacity experiments reveals
that the magnetic properties at low temperatures can be described by an
effective $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ Kramers doublet and the ground state is a singlet
with a tiny spin gap. Although the magnetic susceptibility could be analyzed in
terms of the interacting dimer model with an isotropic intradimer coupling
$J_0/k_{\rm B} \simeq 7.6$ K, this model fails to reproduce the shape of
magnetization isotherm and heat capacity data. A model of isolated spin dimers
with the anisotropic exchange couplings $J_{xy} \simeq 3.5$ K and $J_{z} \simeq
11$ K provides an adequate description to the magnetic susceptibility,
magnetization isotherm, and heat capacity data at low temperatures.
Interestingly, no field-induced quantum phase phase is detected down to 100~mK
around the critical field of gap closing, suggesting the absence of
Bose-Einstein condensation of triplons and establishing isolated dimers with a
negligible interdimer coupling.

<h3>A Coarse-grained Model for Aqueous Two-phase Systems: Application to  Ferrofluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16906</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Scacchi, Carlo Rigoni, Mikko Haataja, Jaakko V. I. Timonen, Maria Sammalkorpi</i>
<p>Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs), that is, phase-separating solutions of
water soluble but mutually immiscible molecular species, offer fascinating
prospects for selective partitioning, purification, and extraction. Here, we
formulate a general Brownian dynamics based coarse-grained simulation model for
a polymeric ATPS comprising two water soluble but mutually immiscible polymer
species. A third solute species, representing, e.g., nanoparticles (NPs),
additional macromolecular species, or impurities can readily be incorporated
into the model. We demonstrate that the model captures satisfactorily the phase
separation, partitioning, and interfacial properties of a model ATPS composed
of a polymer mixture of dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in which magnetic
NPs selectively partition into one of the two polymeric phases. The NP
partitioning is characterized both via the computational model and
experimentally under different conditions. The simulation model captures the
trends observed in the experiments and quantitatively links the partitioning
behavior to the component species interactions. Finally, the response of the
simulation model to external magnetic field, with the magnetic NPs as the
additional partitioned component, shows that the ATPS interface fluctuations
can be controlled by the magnetic field at length scales much smaller than
those probed experimentally to date.

<h3>Diffusive evaporation dynamics in polymer solutions is ubiquitous</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16911" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16911</a>
<br>
<i>Max Huisman, Wilson C.K. Poon, Patrick B. Warren, Simon Titmuss, Davide Marenduzzo</i>
<p>Recent theory and experiments have shown how the buildup of a
high-concentration polymer layer at a one-dimensional solvent-air interface can
lead to an evaporation rate that scales with time as $t^{-1/2}$ and that is
insensitive to the ambient humidity. Using phase field modelling we show that
this scaling law constitutes a naturally emerging robust regime,
Diffusion-Limited Evaporation (DLE). This regime dominates the dynamical state
diagram of the system, which also contains regions of constant and arrested
evaporation, confirming and extending understanding of recent experimental
observations and theoretical predictions. We provide a theoretical argument to
show that the scaling observed in the DLE regime occurs for a wide range of
parameters, and our simulations predict that it can occur in two-dimensional
geometries as well. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to more complex
systems.

<p>High-performance, environmentally-friendly biodegradable packaging as

Modification pertaining to improve the properties, lower the cost, and include

<h3>Deriving the one-electron Spectral Function for the 1D Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16954</a>
<br>
<i>D. Bozi</i>
<p>This pre-print deals with the one dimensional Hubbard model, as described by
the Pseudofermion Dynamical Theory (PDT), with the purpose of (1) deriving a
novel expression for the one electron spectral function for all values of the
on-site repulsion $U/t$ and filling $n \in (0,1)$, at vanishing magnetisation
$m \rightarrow 0$, and (2) discover how to correctly compare the results
originating from two different theoretical frameworks in the $U/t \rightarrow
\infty$ limit, as a first-test of the novel expressions obtained in this paper.
Thus, an exact expression of the spectral function is obtained, which is
furthermore successfully compared with previously known results in the $U
\rightarrow \infty$ limit.
Following the PDT, the expression for the one electron spectral function
factorises into a spin part and a charge part for all values of the on-site
repulsion $U/t$, where the dynamical quantum objects are spin zero and
$\eta$-spin (charge) zero singlet pairs of so-called rotated electrons, which
in turn are obtained from the original electrons by a unitary transformation.
The spectral function is exemplified for $U/t = 400$, with the purpose of
comparing it with the same function obtained by other authors (and other means)
in the $U \rightarrow \infty$ limit.
The main pillars of the PDT is presented in a summarised form. For example,
we will only be interested in excited energy eigenstates which originate the
most significant singular features of the spectral map in the $(k,\omega)$
plane, safely ignoring higher order contributions. Even though emphasis is
given on step-by-step derivations where necessary, derivations that have been
done elsewhere and/or do not notably contribute to the physical understanding,
are sometimes avoided. Therefore, references for further study are given
throughout the paper.

<i>Menglin Shi, Sheng Zhang, Gia-Wei Chern</i>
<p>Metallic spin glass systems, such as dilute magnetic alloys, are
characterized by randomly distributed local moments coupled to each other
through a long-range electron-mediated effective interaction. We present a
scalable machine learning (ML) framework for dynamical simulations of metallic
spin glasses. A Behler-Parrinello type neural-network model, based on the
principle of locality, is developed to accurately and efficiently predict
electron-induced local magnetic fields that drive the spin dynamics. A crucial
component of the ML model is a proper symmetry-invariant representation of
local magnetic environment which is direct input to the neural net. We develop
such a magnetic descriptor by incorporating the spin degrees of freedom into
the atom-centered symmetry function methods which are widely used in ML
force-field models for quantum molecular dynamics. We apply our approach to
study the relaxation dynamics of an amorphous generalization of the s-d model.
Our work highlights the promising potential of ML models for large-scale
dynamical modeling of itinerant magnets with quenched disorder.

<i>Kirill Kozlov, Grigor Adamyan, Mariia Kryvoruchko, Yelizaveta Kulynych, Leonid Levitov</i>
<p>Landau levels perturbed by a periodic potential have long been known broaden
into fractals. Motivated by recent advances in twistronics, we introduce a
'Hofstadter quasicrystal' problem describing Landau levels perturbed by
incommensurate cosine waves. We consider a quasiperiodic potential representing
a pair of $45^\circ{}$-rotated Hofstadter problems, finding a complex spectrum
completely distinct from the Hofstadter spectrum, and yet sharing with it many
common features. Surprisingly, due to the eight-fold symmetry of the
incommensurate potential, the problem exhibits hidden symmetry arising at
special `magic' values of the magnetic field. The periodicity in the magic
field values explains striking wide-range oscillations in the spectrum width
that have irrational periodicity distinct from the Aharonov-Bohm and Brown-Zak
periodicities. The prominent character of these oscillations makes them readily
accessible in state-of-the-art moir\'e graphene systems.

<p>Nowadays ultrahigh performance superconducting nanowire single-photon
detectors are the key elements in a variety of devices from biological research
to quantum communications and computing. Accurate tuning of superconducting
material properties is a powerful resource for fabricating single-photon
detectors with a desired properties. Here, we report on the major theoretical
relations between ultrathin niobium nitride (NbN) films properties and
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors characteristics, as well as
ultrathin NbN films properties dependence on reactive magnetron sputtering
recipes. Based on this study we formulate the exact requirements to ultrathin
NbN films for ultrahigh performance superconducting nanowire single-photon
detectors. Then, we experimentally study ultrathin NbN films properties
(morphology, crystalline structure, critical temperature, sheet resistance) on
silicon, sapphire, silicon dioxide and silicon nitride substrates sputtered
with various recipes. We demonstrate ultrathin NbN films (obtained with more
than 100 films deposition) with a wide range of critical temperature from 2.5
to 12.1 K and sheet resistance from 285 to 2000 ~$\Omega$/sq, as well as
investigate a sheet resistance evolution over for more than 40\% within two
years. Finally, we found out that one should use ultrathin NbN films with
specific critical temperature near 9 K and sheet resistance of 400 ~$\Omega$/sq
for ultrahigh performance SNSPD.

<h3>Generation of higher-order topological insulators using periodic driving</h3>

<br>
<i>Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha</i>
<p>Topological insulators~(TIs) are a new class of materials that resemble
ordinary band insulators in terms of a bulk band gap but exhibit protected
metallic states on their boundaries. In this modern direction, higher-order
TIs~(HOTIs) are a new class of TIs in dimensions $d>1$. These HOTIs possess $(d
- 1)$-dimensional boundaries that, unlike those of conventional TIs, do not
conduct via gapless states but are themselves TIs. Precisely, an $n^{\rm th}$
order $d$-dimensional higher-order topological insulator is characterized by
the presence of boundary modes that reside on its $d_c=(d-n)$-dimensional
boundary. For instance, a three-dimensional second (third) order TI hosts
gapless (localized) modes on the hinges (corners), characterized by $d_c = 1
(0)$. Similarly, a second-order TI in two dimensions only has localized corner
states ($d_c = 0$). These higher-order phases are protected by various
crystalline as well as discrete symmetries. The non-equilibrium tunability of
the topological phase has been a major academic challenge where periodic
Floquet drive provides us golden opportunity to overcome that barrier. Here, we
discuss different periodic driving protocols to generate Floquet higher-order
TIs while starting from a non-topological or first-order topological phase.
Furthermore, we emphasize that one can generate the dynamical anomalous
$\pi$-modes along with the concomitant $0$-modes. The former can be realized
only in a dynamical setup. We exemplify the Floquet higher-order topological
modes in two and three dimensions in a systematic way. Especially, in two
dimensions, we demonstrate a Floquet second-order TI hosting $0$- and $\pi$
corner modes. Whereas a three-dimensional Floquet second-order TI and Floquet
third-order TI manifest one- and zero-dimensional hinge and corner modes,
respectively.

<h3>Optimal control of interacting active particles on complex landscapes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17039" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17039</a>
<br>
<i>Sumit Sinha, Vishaal Krishnan, L Mahadevan</i>
<p>Active many-body systems composed of many interacting degrees of freedom
often operate out of equilibrium, giving rise to non-trivial emergent behaviors
which can be functional in both evolved and engineered contexts. This naturally
suggests the question of control to optimize function. Using navigation as a
paradigm for function, we deploy the language of stochastic optimal control
theory to formulate the inverse problem of shepherding a system of interacting
active particles across a complex landscape. We implement a solution to this
high-dimensional problem using an Adjoint-based Path Integral Control (APIC)
algorithm that combines the power of recently introduced continuous-time
back-propagation methods and automatic differentiation with the classical
Feynman-Kac path integral formulation in statistical mechanics. Numerical
experiments for controlling individual and interacting particles in complex
landscapes show different classes of successful navigation strategies as a
function of landscape complexity, as well as the intrinsic noise and drive of
the active particles. However, in all cases, we see the emergence of paths that
correspond to traversal along the edges of ridges and ravines, which we can
understand using a variational analysis. We also show that the work associated
with optimal strategies is inversely proportional to the length of the time
horizon of optimal control, a result that follows from scaling considerations.
All together, our approach serves as a foundational framework to control active
non-equilibrium systems optimally to achieve functionality, embodied as a path
on a high-dimensional manifold.
