<h3>Irida-Graphene: A New 2D Carbon Allotrope</h3>

Several 2D carbon-based materials have been computationally designed in the
last years due to the success achieved by graphene. Here, we propose a new 2D
all-sp$^2$ carbon allotrope, named Irida-Graphene (IG), using a bottom-up
approach. IG is composed of fused rings containing 3-6-8 carbon atoms. We
employed density functional theory calculations and reactive (ReaxFF) molecular
dynamics simulations to examine its mechanical, structural, electronic, and
optical properties. Results showed that IG exhibits good dynamical and thermal
stabilities. Its estimated elastic modulus varies between 80-113 GPa. IG is a
metallic material and presents a Dirac cone above the Fermi level in the center
of the band. The intense optical activity of IG is restricted to the infrared
and violet regions. IG can act as a violet collector for photon energies of
about 3.0 eV since it presents very low reflectivity and refractive index
greater than one.

<h3>Spatial correlation functions for non-ergodic stochastic processes of macroscopic system</h3>

Focusing on non-ergodic macroscopic systems we reconsider the variances of
time averages time-series. The total variance (direct average over all
time-series) is known to be the sum of an internal variance (fluctuations
within the meta-basins) and an external variance (fluctuations between
meta-basins). It is shown that whenever the time-averaged observable can be
expressed as a volume average of a local field the three variances can be
written as volume averages of correlation functions with the total correlation
function being the sum of an internal and an external correlation function. The
dependences of the the different variancescan thus be traced back to the
internal and the external correlation function. Various relations are
illustrated using lattice spring models with spatially correlated spring
constants.

We present a new quantum molecular dynamics (MD) method where the electronic
structure and atomic forces are solved by a real-space dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT). Contrary to most quantum MD methods that are based on effective
single-particle wave functions, the DMFT approach is able to describe
correlation-induced Mott metal-insulator transitions and the associated
incoherent electronic excitations in an atomic liquid. We apply the DMFT-MD
method to study Mott transitions in an atomic liquid model which can be viewed
as the liquid-state generalization of the Hubbard model. The half-filled
Hubbard liquids also provide a minimum model for alkali fluid metals. Our
simulations uncover two distinct types of Mott transition depending on the
atomic bonding and short-range structures in the electronically delocalized
phase. In the first scenario where atoms tend to form dimers, increasing the
Hubbard repulsion gives rise to a transition from a molecular insulator to an
atomic insulator with a small window of enhanced metallicity in the vicinity of
the localization transition. On the other hand, for Hubbard liquids with atoms
forming large conducting clusters, the localization of electrons leads to the
fragmentation of clusters and is intimately related to the liquid-gas
transition of atoms. Implications of our results for metal-insulator
transitions in fluid alkali metals are discussed.

The distribution of monomers along a linear polymer grafted on a hard wall is
modelled by determining the probability distribution of occupied vertices of
Dyck and ballot path models of adsorbing linear polymers. For example, the
probability that a Dyck path passes through the lattice site with coordinates
$(\lfloor \epsilon n \rfloor,\lfloor \delta \sqrt{n}\rfloor)$ in the square
lattice, for $0 < \epsilon < 1$ and $\delta\geq 0$, is determined
asymptotically as $n\to\infty$ and this uncovers the probability density of
vertices along Dyck path in the limit as the length of the path $n$ approaches
infinity: $$\hbox{P}_r (\epsilon,\delta) =
\frac{4\delta^2}{\sqrt{\pi\,\epsilon^3(1-\epsilon)^3}} \,
e^{-\delta^2/\epsilon(1-\epsilon)}\ .$$ The properties of a polymer coating of
a hard wall and the density or distribution of monomers in the coating is
relevant in applications such as the stabilisation of a colloid dispersion by a
polymer or in a drug delivery system such as a drug-eluding stent covered by a
grafted polymer.

<br>
<br>
Experimental progress in qubit manufacturing calls for the development of new
theoretical tools to analyze quantum data. We show how an unsupervised
machine-learning technique can be used to understand short-range entangled
many-qubit systems using data of local measurements. The method successfully
constructs the phase diagram of a cluster-state model and detects the
respective order parameters of its phases, including string order parameters.
For the toric code subject to external magnetic fields, the machine identifies
the explicit forms of its two stabilizers. Prior information of the underlying
Hamiltonian or the quantum states is not needed; instead, the machine outputs
their characteristic observables. Our work opens the door for a
first-principles application of hybrid algorithms that aim at strong
interpretability without supervision.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08818v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08818v1</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo Gallone, Matteo Marian, Antonio Ponno, Stefano Ruffo</i>
<br>
<br>
We prove analytically and show numerically that the dynamics of the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain is characterised by a transient Burgers
turbulence regime on a wide range of time and energy scales. This regime is
present at long wavelengths and energy per particle small enough that
equipartition is not reached on a fast time scale. In this range, we prove that
the driving mechanism to thermalisation is the formation of a shock that can be
predicted using a pair of generalised Burgers equations. We perform a
perturbative calculation at small energy per particle, proving that the energy
spectrum of the chain $E_k$ decays as a power law, $E_k\sim k^{-\zeta(t)}$, on
an extensive range of wavenumbers $k$. We predict that $\zeta(t)$ takes first
the value $8/3$ at the Burgers shock time, and then reaches a value close to
$2$ within two shock times. The value of the exponent $\zeta=2$ persists for
several shock times before the system eventually relaxes to equipartition.
During this wide time-window, an exponential cut-off in the spectrum is
observed at large $k$, in agreement with previous results. Such a scenario
turns out to be universal, i.e. independent of the parameters characterising
the system and of the initial condition, once time is measured in units of the
shock time.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08817v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08817v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Nanofibrous networks are the foundation and natural building strategy for all
life forms on our planet. Apart from providing structural integrity to cells
and tissues, they also provide a porous scaffold allowing transport of
substances, where the resulting properties rely on the nanoscale network
structure. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in extracting and
reassembling biobased nanofibers to create sustainable, advanced materials with
applications ranging from high-performance textiles to artificial tissues.
However, achieving structural control of the extracted nanofibers is
challenging as it is strongly dependent on the extraction methods and source
materials. Furthermore, the small nanofiber cross-sections and fast Brownian
dynamics make them notoriously difficult to characterize in dispersions. In
this work, we study the diffusive motion of spherical gold nanoparticles in
semi-dilute networks of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) using X-ray Photon
Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). We find that the motion becomes increasingly
subdiffusive with higher CNF concentration, where the dynamics can be
decomposed into several superdiffusive relaxation modes in reciprocal space.
Using simulations of confined Brownian dynamics in combination with simulated
XPCS-experiments, we observe that the dynamic modes can be connected to pore
sizes and inter-pore transport properties in the network. The demonstrated
analytical strategy by combining experiments using tracer particles with a
digital twin may be the key to understand nanoscale properties of nanofibrous
networks.

<br>
<i>Martin Ulaga, Jernej Mravlje, Peter Prelovek, Jure Kokalj</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the electronic thermal conductivity $\kappa_\textrm{el}$ and the
thermal diffusion constant $D_\textrm{Q,el}$ in the square lattice Hubbard
model using the finite-temperature Lanczos method. We exploit the
Nernst-Einstein relation for thermal transport and interpret the strong
non-monotonous temperature dependence of $\kappa_\textrm{el}$ in terms of that
of $D_\textrm{Q,el}$ and the electronic specific heat $c_\textrm{el}$. We
present also the results for the Heisenberg model on a square lattice and
ladder geometries. We study the effects of doping and consider the doped case
also with the dynamical mean-field theory. We show that $\kappa_\textrm{el}$ is
below the corresponding Mott-Ioffe-Regel value in almost all calculated
regimes, while the mean free path is typically above lattice spacing. We
discuss the opposite effect of quasi-particle renormalization on the electronic
heat and charge diffusion constants. The calculated Lorenz ratio differs from
the Sommerfeld value. We present results for the anisotropic marginal Fermi
liquid model and discuss the results in relation to experiments on cuprates.

</body><h3>Observation of Fermi liquid phase with broken symmetry in a single crystalline nanorod of Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08811v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08811v1</a>
<br>
<i>Bikash Ghosh, Abhishek Juyal, Sourav Biswas, R. Rawat, Arijit Kundu, Soumik Mukhopadhyay</i>
<br>
<br>
We report experimental evidence of emergent broken symmetry Fermi liquid
state in an isolated single crystalline nanorod of $\rm Pr_2 Ir_2 O_7$. We find
clear signature of the onset of the Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature
marked by the sign inversion of magnetoresistance from negative at high
temperature, characteristic of incoherent Kondo scattering, to positive as well
as a $\rm T^2$ dependence of resistivity at low temperature. A resistive
anomaly is observed, which is accompanied by thermal hysteresis in the presence
of magnetic field, suggesting itinerant metamagnetism. The observed high field
negative magnetoresistance with quadratic field dependence at low temperature,
which is most likely due to suppression of itinerant spin fluctuation, and the
irreversibility of the magneto-resistive properties in the Fermi liquid regime
suggest existence of an unusual state with broken spin rotation and time
reversal symmetry, hallmark of `hastatic' order. The major features of such
temperature dependence of resistivity and magnetoresistance can be explained in
a phenomenological model incorporating two distinct hybridization channels,
which is physically consistent with the possibility of the formation of the
`hastatic' Fermi liquid phase.

</body><h3>Exact short-time height distribution and dynamical phase transition in the relaxation of a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interface with random initial condition</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08801v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08801v1</a>
<br>
<i>Naftali R. Smith</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the relaxation statistics of the one-point height $H=h(x=0,t)$
where $h(x,t)$ is the evolving height of a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) interface,
starting from a Brownian (random) initial condition. We find that, at short
times, the distribution of $H$ takes the same scaling form
$-\ln\mathcal{P}\left(H,t\right)=S\left(H\right)/\sqrt{t}$ as the distribution
of H for the KPZ interface driven by noise, and we find the exact
large-deviation function $S(H)$ analytically. At a critical value $H=H_c$, the
second derivative of $S(H)$ jumps, signaling a dynamical phase transition
(DPT). Furthermore, we calculate exactly the most likely history of the
interface that leads to a given $H$, and show that the DPT is associated with
spontaneous breaking of the mirror symmetry $x \leftrightarrow -x$ of the
interface. In turn, we find that this symmetry breaking is a consequence of the
non-convexity of a large-deviation function that is closely related to $S(H)$,
and describes a similar problem but in half space. Moreover, the critical point
$H_c$ is related to the inflection point of the large-deviation function of the
half-space problem.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08793v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08793v1</a>
<br>
<i>Deng Pan, Fanlong Meng, Yuliang Jin</i>
<br>
<br>
The jamming transition, generally manifested by a rapid increase of rigidity
under compression (i.e., compression hardening), is ubiquitous in amorphous
materials. Here we study shear hardening in deeply annealed frictionless
packings generated by numerical simulations, reporting critical scalings absent
in compression hardening. We demonstrate that hardening is a natural
consequence of shear-induced memory destruction. Based on an elasticity theory,
we reveal two independent microscopic origins of shear hardening: (i) the
increase of the interaction bond number and (ii) the emergence of anisotropy
and long-range correlations in the orientations of bonds, the latter highlights
the essential difference between compression and shear hardening. Through the
establishment of physical laws specific to anisotropy, our work completes the
criticality and universality of jamming transition, and the elasticity theory
of amorphous solids.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08792v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08792v1</a>
<br>
<i>Prashant Singh, Saikat Santra, Anupam Kundu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the extreme value statistics of a run and tumble particle (RTP) in
one dimension till its first passage to the origin starting from the position
$x_0~(>0)$. This model has recently drawn a lot of interest due to its
biological application in modelling the motion of certain species of bacteria.
Herein, we analytically study the exact time-dependent propagators for a single
RTP in a finite interval with absorbing conditions at its two ends. By
exploiting a path decomposition technique, we use these propagators
appropriately to compute the joint distribution $\mathscr{P}(M,t_m)$ of the
maximum displacement $M$ till first-passage and the time $t_m$ at which this
maximum is achieved exactly. The corresponding marginal distributions
$\mathbb{P}_M(M)$ and $P_M(t_m)$ are studied separately and verified
numerically. In particular, we find that the marginal distribution $P_M(t_m)$
has interesting asymptotic forms for large and small $t_m$. While for small
$t_m$, the distribution $P_M(t_m)$ depends sensitively on the initial velocity
direction $\sigma _i$ and is completely different from the Brownian motion, the
large $t_m$ decay of $P_M(t_m)$ is same as that of the Brownian motion although
the amplitude crucially depends on the initial conditions $x_0$ and $\sigma
_i$. We verify all our analytical results to high precision by numerical
simulations.

<br>
<br>
Trends of miniaturized devices and quantum interference electronics lead to
the long desire of Fano interference in single-molecule junctions, here, which
is successfully demonstrated using the 2,7-di(4-pyridyl)-9,9'-spirobifluorene
molecule with a long backbone group and a short side group. Experimentally, the
two electrically coupled groups are found to contribute to two blurred
degenerate points in the differential conductance mapping. This forms a
characteristic non-centrosymmetric double-crossing feature, with distinct
temperature response for each crossing. Theoretically, we describe the
practical in-junction electron transmission using a new two-tunnelling-channel
coupling model and obtain a working formula with a Fano term and a Breit-Wigner
term. The formula is shown to provide a good fit for all the mapping data and
their temperature dependence in three dimensions, identifying the Fano
component. Our work thus forms a complete set of evidence of the Fano
interference in a single-molecule junction induced by two-tunnelling-channel
coupling transport. Density functional theory calculations are used to
corroborate this new physics.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08775v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08775v1</a>
<br>
<i>Natalia Alyabyeva, Jacques Ding, Mylne Sauty, Judith Woerle, Yann Jousseaume, Gabriel Ferro, Jeffrey C. McCallum, Jacques Peretti, Brett C. Johnson, Alistair C. H. Rowe</i>
<br>
<br>
Scanning tunneling luminescence microscopy (STLM) along with scanning
tunneling spectroscopy (STS) is applied to a step-bunched, oxidized 4H-SiC
surface prepared on the silicon face of a commercial, n-type SiC wafer using a
silicon melt process. The step-bunched surface consists of atomically smooth
terraces parallel to the [0001] crystal planes, and rougher risers consisting
of nanoscale steps formed by the termination of these planes. The rather
striking topography of this surface is well resolved with large tip biases of
the order of -8 V and set currents of magnitude less than 1 nA. Hysteresis in
the STS spectra is preferentially observed on the risers suggesting that they
contain a higher density of surface charge traps than the terraces where
hysteresis is more frequently absent. Similarly, at 50 K intense sub-gap light
emission centered around 2.4 eV is observed mainly on the risers albeit only
with larger tunneling currents of magnitude equal to or greater than 10 nA.
These results demonstrate that STLM holds great promise for the observation of
impurities and defects responsible for sub-gap light emission with spatial
resolutions approaching the length scale of the defects themselves.

<br>
<i>Francesco Chippari, Marco Picco</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the quench dynamics of the $q$ Potts model on different
bi/tri-dimensional lattice topologies. In particular we are interested in
instantaneous quenches from $T_i \rightarrow \infty$ to $T \leq T_s$, where
$T_s$ is the (pseudo)-spinodal temperature. The goal is to explain why, in the
large-$q$ limit, the low-temperature dynamics freezes on some lattices while,
on others, the equilibrium configuration is easily reached. The cubic ($3d$)
and the triangular ($2d$) lattices are analysed in detail. We show that the
dynamics blocks when lattices have acyclic \textit{unitary structures} while
the system goes to the equilibrium when these are cyclic, no matter the
coordination number ($z$) of the particular considered lattice.

<br>
<i>Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Tokura, Takeo Kato</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the backaction of quantum measurements on heat transport through a
two-level system by considering the continuous projective measurement onto an
eigen state of the two-level system. For the non-selective measurement, the
backaction appears as a dephasing effect on the two-level system. We formulate
the heat current under the selective measurement with a stochastic master
equation and show that the cross-correlation between the measurement outcomes
and the heat current contains information on the backaction. We expect that our
findings can be verified by using a platform of superconducting circuits.
