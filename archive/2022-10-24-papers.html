<h3>Molecular insights into the physics of poly(amidoamine)-dendrimer-based  supercapacitors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12414</a>

Increasing the energy density in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs),
also known as supercapacitors, remains an active area of research.
Specifically, there is a need to design and discover electrode and electrolyte
materials with enhanced electrochemical storage capacity. Here, using fully
atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate the performance
of hyper-branched 'poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)' dendrimer as an electrolyte and an
electrode coating material in a graphene based supercapacitor. We investigate
the performance of the capacitor using two different modeling approaches,
namely the constant charge method (CCM) and the constant potential method
(CPM). These simulations facilitated the direct calculation of the charge
density, electrostatic potential and field, and hence the differential
capacitance. We found that the presence of the dendrimer in the electrodes and
the electrolyte increased the capacitance by about 65.25 % and 99.15 %
respectively, compared to the bare graphene electrode based aqueous EDLCs.
Further analysis revealed that these increases were due to the enhanced
electrostatic screening and reorganization of the double layer structure of the
dendrimer based electrolyte.

<h3>Hybrid-order topological odd-parity superconductors via Floquet  engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12439</a>

Holding a promise in performing quantum computation, topological
superconductor has been generalized to the second-order case. The hybridization
of different orders of topological superconductors is attractive because it
facilitates the simultaneous utilization of their respective advantages.
However, previous studies found that they cannot coexist in one system due to
the constraint of symmetry. We here propose a Floquet-engineering scheme to
generate a 2D hybrid-order topological superconductors in an odd-parity
superconductor system. Exotic hybrid-order phases exhibiting the coexisting
gapless chiral edge states and gapped Majorana corner states not only in two
different quasienergy gaps but also in one single quasienergy gap are created
by the periodic driving. The generalization of this scheme to the 3D system
makes us discover a second-order superconducting Dirac semimetal featured with
the coexisting of surface and hinge Majorana Fermi arcs. Our results break a
fundamental limitation on topological phases and opens a feasible avenue to
realize novel topological superconductor phases without static analogs.

<h3>Anomalous supercurrent modulated by interfacial magnetizations in  Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12718</a>
<br>

Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we investigate the transport of
the Josephson current in a S/$f_L$-F$_1$-$f_C$-F$_2$-$f_R$/S junction, where S
and F$_{1,2}$ are superconductors and ferromagnets, and $f_{L, C, R}$ are the
left, central, and right spin-active interfaces. These interfaces have
noncollinear magnetizations, and the azimuthal angles of the magnetizations at
the $f_{L, C, R}$ interfaces are $\chi_{L, C, R}$. We demonstrate that, if both
the ferromagnets have antiparallel magnetizations, the critical current
oscillates as a function of the exchange field and the thickness of the
ferromagnets for particular $\chi_L$ or $\chi_R$. By contrast, when the
magnetization at the $f_C$ interface is perpendicular to that at the $f_L$ and
$f_R$ interfaces, the critical current reaches a larger value and is hardly
affected by the exchange field and the thickness. Interestingly, if both the
ferromagnets are converted to antiparallel half-metals, the critical current
maintains a constant value and rarely changes with the ferromagnetic
thicknesses and the azimuthal angles. At this time, an anomalous supercurrent
can appear in the system, in which case the Josephson current still exists even
if the superconducting phase difference $\phi$ is zero. This supercurrent
satisfies the current-phase relation $I=I_c\sin(\phi+\phi_0)$ with $I_c$ being
the critical current and $\phi_0=2\chi_C-\chi_L-\chi_R$. We deduce that the
additional phase $\phi_0$ arises from phase superposition, where the phase is
captured by the spin-triplet pairs when they pass through each spin-active
interface. In addition, when both the ferromagnets are transformed into
parallel half-metals, the $f_C$ interface never contributes any phase to the
supercurrent and $\phi_0=\chi_R-\chi_L+\pi$. In such a case, the current-phase
relation is similar to that in a S/$f_L$-F-$f_R$/S junction.

<h3>Effective circuit modelling and experimental realization of an  ultra-compact self-rectifier flux pump</h3>

<br>
<br>
This paper presents experimental and modelling results of an ultra-compact
self-rectifier flux pump energizing a superconducting coil. The device fits
inside a volume of 65x65x50~mm and generates up to 320~A dc through the coil
and a peak output voltage up to 60~mV. We also develop and present a full
electromagnetic effective circuit model of the flux pump and compare its
predictions to the experimental results. We show that our model can reproduce
accurately the charging of the load coil and that it reproduces the systematic
dependence of the maximum load coil current on the input current waveform. The
experiments and modelling together show also the importance of dc-flux offsets
in the transformer core on the final achievable current through the coil. The
miniaturization possible for this class of flux pump and their minimal
heat-leak into the cryogenic environment from thermal conduction make them
attractive for applications with demanding size, weight and power limitations.
Our effective circuit model is a useful tool in the understanding, design and
optimization of such flux pumps which will accelerate their progression from
research devices to their application.

<h3>Emergent Mott-insulators at non-integer fillings and devil's staircase  induced by attractive interaction in many-body polarons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13316</a>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the ground state properties of an ultracold atom system
consisting of many-body polarons, quasiparticles formed by impurity atoms in
optical lattices immersing in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We find the
nearest-neighbor attractive interaction between polarons can give rise to rich
physics that is peculiar to this system. In a relatively shallow optical
lattice, the attractive interaction can drive the system being in a self-bound
superfluid phase with its particle density distribution manifesting a
self-concentrated structure. While in a relatively deep optical lattice, the
attractive interaction can drive the system forming the Mott-insulator phase
even though the global filling factor is not integer. Interestingly, in the
Mott-insulator regime, the system can support a series of different
Mott-insulators with their effective density manifesting a devil's staircase
structure with respect to the strength of attractive interaction. Detailed
estimation on relevant experimental parameters shows that these rich physics
can be readily observed in current experimental setups.

<h3>Orientation-dependent propulsion of active Brownian spheres: from  self-advection to programmable cluster shapes</h3>

Applications of active particles require a method for controlling their
dynamics. While this is typically achieved via direct interventions, indirect
interventions based, e.g., on an orientation-dependent self-propulsion speed of
the particles, become increasingly popular. In this work, we investigate
systems of interacting active Brownian spheres in two spatial dimensions with
orientation-dependent propulsion using analytical modeling and Brownian
dynamics simulations. It is found that the orientation-dependence leads to
self-advection, circulating currents, and programmable cluster shapes.

<h3>Voltage-controlled topological interface states for bending waves in  soft dielectric phononic crystal plates</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The operating frequency range of passive topological phononic crystals is
generally fixed and narrow, limiting their practical applications. To overcome
this difficulty, here we design and investigate a one-dimensional soft
dielectric phononic crystal (PC) plate system with actively tunable topological
interface states via the mechanical and electric loads. We use nonlinear
electroelasticity theory and linearized incremental theory to derive the
governing equations. First we determine the nonlinear static response of the
soft dielectric PC plate subjected to a combination of axial force and electric
voltage. Then we study the motion of superimposed incremental bending waves. By
adopting the Spectral Element Method, we obtain the dispersion relation for the
infinite PC plate and the transmission coefficient for the finite PC plate
waveguide. Numerical results show that the low-frequency topological interface
state exists at the interface of the finite phononic plate waveguide with two
topologically different elements. By simply adjusting the axial force or the
electric voltage, an increase or decrease in the frequency of the topological
interface state can be realized. Furthermore, applying the electric voltage
separately on different elements of the PC plate waveguide is a flexible and
smart method to tune the topological interface state in a wide range. These
results provide guidance for designing soft smart wave devices with
low-frequency tunable topological interface states.

Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are a type of multifunctional materials with
salient features that are very attractive in developing soft, lightweight, and
small-scale transducers and robotics. This paper reviews the mechanics of soft
DE structures, focusing on their dynamic responses, including vibrations and
waves in typical structures. The basic formulations of nonlinear
electroelasticity are briefly summarized by following the descriptions of
Dorfmann and Ogden. The recent advances in the study on linearized dynamic
problems of DE plates and shells are then outlined according to the geometric
configurations as well as the coordinates thereof adopted. Some interesting
observations from the numerical results are highlighted, and the underlying
physics is discussed. For completeness, an account of the nonlinear dynamic
characteristics of DE structures is also given. For DE structures with a
periodic arrangement, i.e., DE phononic crystals (PCs) or metamaterials, this
paper reviews the designs, solutions, and results to illustrate the wide-range
tunability of band structure that is realized by large reversible deformation
and electromechanical coupling. The present literature survey could be a useful
guide for future studies on the dynamic topics of DE structures.

<h3>Non-Hermitian boundary spectral winding</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12178</a>
<br>

Spectral winding of complex eigenenergies represents a topological aspect
unique in non-Hermitian systems, which vanishes in one-dimensional (1D) systems
under the open boundary conditions (OBC). In this work, we discover a boundary
spectral winding in two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems under the OBC,
originating from the interplay between Hermitian boundary localization and
non-Hermitian non-reciprocal pumping. Such a nontrivial boundary topology is
demonstrated in a non-Hermitian breathing Kagome model with a triangle
geometry, whose 1D boundary mimics a 1D non-Hermitian system under the periodic
boundary conditions with nontrivial spectral winding. In a trapezoidal
geometry, such a boundary spectral winding can even co-exist with corner
accumulation of edge states, instead of extended ones along 1D boundary of a
triangle geometry. An OBC type of hybrid skin-topological effect may also
emerge in a trapezoidal geometry, provided the boundary spectral winding
completely vanishes. By studying the Green's function, we unveil that the
boundary spectral winding can be detected from a topological response of the
system to a local driving field, offering a realistic method to extract the
nontrivial boundary topology for experimental studies.

$\require{mediawiki-texvc}$The locally non-centrosymmetric superconductor
SrPtAs is proposed to host a topological chiral $d$-wave state, but
experimental reports have been limited to polycrystalline samples. Here we
report the synthesis of single crystalline SrPtAs grown from Pb flux. SrPtAs
crystallizes in the hexagonal space group $P6_{3}$/$mmc$ with lattice
parameters $a$ = 4.2445(4) ${\AA}$ and $c$ = 8.9513(18) ${\AA}$. Magnetic
susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements reveal a superconducting
transition at T$_c$ $\sim$2.2 K, in agreement with previous reports on
polycrystalline samples. Surprisingly, heat capacity data show only a small
bulk transition at 0.7 K. We discuss the possible origins of the discrepancy
between the various measurements.

We conducted a small-angle neutron scattering experiments (SANS) on the
ferromagnetic semi-metal EuB$_6$, where we observed direct evidence for the
presence of magnetic polarons. We carried out SANS experiments over a large
range of scattering vectors $|\vec{q}|$ from 0.006 to 0.140~\AA$^{-1}$ and 2 to
60~K. Just above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ our experiments show magnetic scattering
intensity, which has a Lorentzian dependence on the wave vector, which is
characteristic for the presence of magnetic polarons. Below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$
the polarons merge and most of the observed intensity is due to scattering from
domain walls.We were able to extract a correlation length $\xi$ which ranges
from $100$ to $300$~\AA\ for the size of the magnetic polarons. This size is
much larger than one would expect for magnetic fluctuations, demonstrating the
influence the magnetic polarons on the phase transition. We were able to
extract a correlation length $\xi$ which ranges from $100$ to $300$~\AA\ for

<h3>Dislocations as natural quantum wires in Diamond</h3>

<br>

We study the electronic properties of the glide set of dislocations in
diamond from first principles using hybrid exchange correlation functionals and
find that the atomic-scale dislocation core states give rise to a prototypical
one-dimensional (1D) band structure, i.e. natural quantum wires. The position
and character of the core states varies strongly with local structure, where
mixed dislocations with dangling bonds exhibit a 1D metallic band with a
characteristic 1D density of states ($1/\sqrt{E})$. This 1D Fermi gas is
spatially localized to single atomic diameter orbital chain along the
dislocation core. When the dangling bonds within the core are reconstructed,
the 1D metallic band disappears. In contrast, pure edge dislocations in diamond
reveal a 1D semiconductor with a direct band gap of 3.0 eV. These calculations
provide a possible explanation to the long standing observation of a blue
luminescence band correlated with dislocations in diamond. This opens the door
to using dislocations as 1D quantum phases with functional (electronic and
optical) properties arising from the atomic-scale core states.

<h3>From magnetic order to valence-change crossover in  EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ using He-gas pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12227</a>
<br>
<i>Bernd Wolf, Felix Spathelf, Jan Zimmermann, Theresa Lundbeck, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Michael Lang</i>
<br>
<br>
We present results of magnetic susceptibility and thermal expansion
measurements performed on high-quality single crystals of
EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ for 0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 0.2 and temperatures 2 K
$\leq T \leq$ 300 K. Data were taken at ambient pressure and finite He-gas
pressure $p$ $\leq$ 0.5 GPa. For x = 0 and ambient pressure we observe a
pronounced valence-change crossover centred around $T'_V$ $\approx$ 160 K with
a non-magnetic ground state. This valence-change crossover is characterized by
an extraordinarily strong pressure dependence of d$T'_V$ /d$p$ = (80 $\pm 10)$
K/GPa. We observe a shift of $T'_V$ to lower temperatures with increasing
Ge-concentration, reaching $T'_V$ $\approx$ 90 K for x = 0.1, while still
showing a non-magnetic ground state. Remarkably, on further increasing x to 0.2
we find a stable Eu$^{(2+\delta)+}$ valence with long-range antiferromagnetic
order below $T_N$ = (47.5 $\pm$ 0.1) K, reflecting a close competition between
two energy scales in this system. In fact, by the application of hydrostatic
pressure as small as 0.1 GPa, the ground state of this system can be changed
from long-range antiferromagnetic order for $p$ $<$ 0.1 GPa to an
intermediate-valence state for $p$ $\geq$ 0.1 GPa.

Electrodynamics of superconductors is primarily the electrodynamics of the
Meissner state, a state characterized by zero magnetic induction of a
superconducting fraction of conduction electrons. Simultaneously, the Meissner
state is characterized by zero resistivity and zero entropy of these electrons.
The latter means that the temperature of an ensemble of superconducting
electrons is zero as well. Understanding properties of the Meissner state
provides a key to understand and predict these and other equilibrium and
non-equilibrium properties of superconductors, e.g., properties of the
intermediate and mixed states, flux quantization, resistanceless transport
current, etc. The reader will see that all these properties have a single and
very simple origin: quantization of the angular momentum of the conduction
electrons combined into Cooper pairs, and that the electrodynamics of
superconductors and superconductivity as a whole is a magnificent manifestation
of the boundless ingenuity of Nature and of the power of Physics laws.

<h3>Two-dimensional natural hyperbolic materials: From polaritons modulation  to applications</h3>

Natural hyperbolic materials (HMs) in two dimensions (2D) have an
extraordinarily high anisotropy and a hyperbolic dispersion relation. Some of
them can even sustain hyperbolic polaritons with great directional propagation
and light compression to deeply sub-wavelength scales due to their inherent
anisotropy. Herein, the anisotropic optical features of 2D natural HMs are
reviewed. Four hyperbolic polaritons (i.e., phonon polaritons, plasmon
polaritons, exciton-polaritons, and shear polaritons) as well as their
generation mechanism are discussed in detail. The natural merits of 2D HMs hold
promise for practical quantum photonic applications such as valley quantum
interference, mid-infrared polarizer, spontaneous emission enhancement,
near-field thermal radiation, and a new generation of optoelectronic
components, among others. These analyses' conclusion outlines existing issues
and potential interesting directions for 2D natural HMs. These findings could
spur more interest in anisotropic 2D atomic crystals in the future, as well as
the quick generation of natural HMs for new applications.

<h3>Extremely Large Magnetoresistance and Anisotropic Transport in  Multipolar Kondo System PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12436</a>
<br>
<i>Takachika Isomae, Akito Sakai, Mingxuan Fu, Takanori Taniguchi, Masashi Takigawa, Satoru Nakatsuji</i>
<br>
<br>
Multipolar Kondo systems offer unprecedented opportunities for designing
astonishing quantum phases and functionalities beyond spin-only descriptions. A
model material platform of this kind is the cubic heavy-fermion system
Pr$Tr_{2}$Al$_{20}$ ($Tr=$ Ti, V), which hosts a nonmagnetic
crystal-electric-field (CEF) ground state and substantial Kondo entanglement of
the local quadrupolar and octopolar moments with the conduction electron sea.
Here, we explore magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall effect of PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$
that develops ferroquadrupolar (FQ) order below $T_{Q} \sim 2$ K and compare
its behavior with that of the non-4$f$ analog, LaTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$. In the FQ
ordered phase, PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ displays extremely large magnetoresistance
(XMR) of $\sim 10^{3}\%$. The unsaturated, quasi-linear field ($B$) dependence
of the XMR violates the conventional Kohler's scaling and defies description
based on carrier compensation alone. By comparing the MR and the Hall effect
observed in PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ and LaTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$, we conclude that the
open-orbit topology on the electron-type Fermi surface (FS) sheet is key for
the observed XMR. The low-temperature MR and the Hall resistivity in
PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ display pronounced anisotropy in the [111] and [001]
magnetic fields, which is absent in LaTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$, suggesting that the
transport anisotropy ties in with the anisotropic magnetic-field response of
the quadrupolar order parameter.

<h3>Floquet engineering of magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$  films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12457" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12457</a>

<br>
<br>
Floquet engineering is an important way to manipulate the electronic states
of condensed matter physics. Recently, the discovery of the magnetic
topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and its family provided a valuable
platform to study magnetic topological phenomena, such as, the quantum
anomalous Hall effect, the axion insulator state and the topological
magnetoelectric effect. In this work, based on the effective model and
first-principles calculations in combination with the Floquet theory, we reveal
that the circularly polarized light (CPL) induces the sign reversal of the
Chern number of odd-septuple-layer (SL) MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin films. In contrast,
the CPL drives the axion insulator state into the quantum anomalous Hall state
in even-SL MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin films. More interestingly, if the topmost van
der Waals gap between the surface layer and the below bulk in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
films is slightly expanded, a high Chern number $|C|=2$ can be realized under
the CPL. Our work demonstrates that the light can induce rich magnetic
topological phases in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, which might have potential
applications in optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Kinematic and volumetric analysis of coupled transmembrane fluxes of  binary electrolyte solution components</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12471" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12471</a>

The paper deals with relationships between the individual transmembrane
fluxes of binary electrolyte solution components and the experimentally
measurable quantities describing rates of transfer processes, namely, the
electric current, the transmembrane volume flow and the rates of concentration
changes in the solutions adjacent to the membrane. Also, we collected and
rigorously defined the kinetic coefficients describing the membrane selective
and electrokinetic properties. A set of useful relationships between these
coefficients is derived. An important specificity of the proposed analysis is
that it does not use the Irreversible Thermodynamic approach by analyzing no
thermodynamic forces that generate the fluxes under consideration. Instead, all
the regularities are derived on the basis of conservation and linearity
reasons. The terminology "Kinematics of Fluxes" is proposed for such an
analysis on the basis of the analogy with Mechanics where Kinematics deals with
regularities of motion by considering no mechanic forces. The only
thermodynamic steps of the analysis relate to the discussion on the partial
molar volumes of electrolyte and ions that are the equilibrium thermodynamic
parameters of the adjacent solutions. These parameters are important for
interrelating between the transmembrane fluxes of the solution components and
the transmembrane volume flow. The paper contains short literature reviews
concerned with the partial molar volumes of electrolyte and ions: the methods
of measurement, the obtained results and their theoretical interpretations. It
is concluded from the reviews that the classical theories should be corrected
to make them applicable for sufficiently concentrated solutions, 1M or higher.
The proposed correction is taken into account in the kinematic analysis.

<h3>In situ micropillar compression of an anisotropic metal-organic  framework single crystal</h3>

Understanding of the complex mechanical behavior of metal-organic frameworks
(MOF) beyond their elastic limit will allow the design of real-world
applications in chemical engineering, optoelectronics, energy conversion
apparatus, and sensing devices. Through in situ compression of micropillars,
the uniaxial stress-strain curves of a copper paddlewheel MOF (HKUST-1) were
determined along two unique crystallographic directions, namely the (100) and
(111) facets. We show strongly anisotropic elastic response where the ratio of
the Young's moduli are E(111) ~ 3.6 x E(100), followed by extensive plastic
flows. Likewise, the yield strengths are considerably different, in which
Y(111) ~ 2 x Y(100) because of the underlying framework anisotropy. We measure
the fracture toughness using micropillar splitting. While in situ tests
revealed differential cracking behavior, the resultant toughness values of the
two facets are comparable, yielding Kc ~ 0.5 MPa m^1/2. This work provides new
insights of porous framework ductility at the micron scale and failure by bonds

Equiatomic NiCoCr solid solutions have been recently shown to display
exceptional mechanical properties, that have been suggested to be linked to
nanostructural short-range order (SRO) features that may arise from thermal
treatments, such as annealing or/and aging. Here, we use hybrid Monte
Carlo-Molecular Dynamics simulations to gain further insights of thermal
effects on the SRO formation as well as the edge dislocation plasticity
mechanisms of equiatomic NiCoCr face-centered cubic solid solution. For that
purpose, we utilize two well-known NiCoCr interatomic potentials, one of which
displays well documented SRO, believed to be linked to experimental evidence
and labeled as the Li-Sheng-Ma potential, while the other (Farkas-Caro) does
not. We use these two potentials to discern short range ordering (from inherent
randomness in random solid solutions) and understand how SROs influence
dislocation depinning dynamics in various thermal annealing scenarios. In this
context, we used robust, scale-dependent metrics to infer a characteristic SRO
size in the Li-Sheng-Ma case by probing local concentration fluctuations which
otherwise indicate uncorrelated patterns in the Farkas-Caro case in a close
agreement with random alloys. Using relevant order parameters, we also report
on the drastic increase of chemical ordering within the stacking fault region.
More importantly, we find that the Li-Sheng-Ma potential leads to excellent
edge dislocation depinning strength with low stacking fault width. Our findings
indicate an enhanced roughening mechanism due to the SROs-misfit synergy that
leads to significant improvements in dislocation glide resistance. We argue
that the improvements in alloy strength have their atomistic origins in the
interplay between nanoscopic SROs and atomic-level misfit properties.

<h3>Quantum Mechanical Assessment of Optimal Photovoltaic Conditions in  Organic Solar Cells</h3>

Recombination losses contribute to reduce $J_{SC}$, $V_{OC}$ and the fill
factor of organic solar cells. Recent advances in non-fullerene organic
photovoltaics have shown, nonetheless, that efficient charge generation can
occur under small energetic driving forces ($\Delta E_{DA}$) and low
recombination losses. To shed light on this issue, we set up a coarse-grained
open quantum mechanical model for investigating the charge generation dynamics
subject to various energy loss mechanisms. The influence of energetic driving
force, Coulomb interaction, vibrational disorder, geminate recombination,
temperature and external bias are included in the analysis of the optimal
photovoltaic conditions for charge carrier generation. The assessment reveals
that the overall energy losses are not only minimized when $\Delta E_{DA}$
approaches the effective reorganization energy at the interface but also become
insensitive to temperature and electric field variations. It is also observed
that a moderate reverse bias reduces geminate recombination losses
significantly at vanishing driving forces, where the charge generation is
strongly affected by temperature.

<h3>Exact analytic formula for conductance predicting a tunable  Sommerfeld-Arrhenius thermal transition within a single-step tunneling  mechanism in molecular junctions subject to mechanical stretching</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that the conductance $G$ of molecular tunnel junctions wherein the
charge transport is dominated by a single energy level can be expressed in
closed analytic form which is exact and valid at arbitrary temperature $T$ and
model parameter values. On this basis, we show that the single-step tunneling
mechanism is compatible with a continuous thermal transition from a weakly
$T$-dependent $G$ at low $T$ (Sommerfeld regime) to a nearly exponential
$1/T$-dependent $G$ at high $T$ (Arrhenius-like regime). We predict that this
Sommerfeld-Arrhenius transition can be observed in real molecular junctions %
(e.g., based on perylene diimide) and can be continuously tuned, e.g., via
mechanical stretching.

<br>
The layered ruthenate family of materials possess an intricate interplay of
structural, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom that yields a plethora
of delicately balanced ground states. This is exemplified by
Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$, which hosts a complex transition at which the lattice
parameters jump, the Fermi surface partially gaps and the spins undergo a
$90^{\circ}$ in-plane reorientation. Here, we show how the transition is driven
by a lattice strain that tunes the electronic bandwidth. We apply uniaxial
stress to single crystals of Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$, using neutron and
resonant x-ray scattering to simultaneously probe the structural and magnetic
responses. These measurements demonstrate that the transition can be driven by
externally induced strain, stimulating the development of a theoretical model
in which an internal strain is generated self-consistently to lower the
electronic energy. We understand the strain to act by modifying tilts and
rotations of the RuO$_{6}$ octahedra, which directly influences the
nearest-neighbour hopping. Our results offer a blueprint for uncovering the
driving force behind coupled phase transitions, as well as a novel route to
controlling them.

<i>I. F. Herrera-Gonzalez, J. A. Mendez-Bermudez</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the localization properties of normal modes in harmonic chains with
mass and spring weak disorder. Using a perturbative approach, an expression for
the localization length is obtained, which is valid for arbitrary correlations
of the disorder, and for practically the whole frequency band. In addition, we
show how to generate effective mobility edges by the use of disorder with long
range self-correlations and cross-correlations. Finally, the transport of
phonons is also analyzed showing effective transparent windows that can be
manipulated through the disorder correlations even for relative short chain
sizes. Our results may have applications in modulating thermal transport,
particularly in the design of thermal filters or in manufacturing
high-thermal-conductivity materials.

We investigate laser emission at the interface of a topological and trivial
phases with loss and gain. The system is described by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model with site-dependent hopping parameters. We study numerically and
analytically the interface states. The ground state is described by the
Jackiw-Rebbi mode with a pure imaginary energy, reflecting the non-Hermiticity
of the system. It is strictly localized only at the A sites. We also find a
series of analytic solutions of excited states based on SUSY quantum mechanics,
where the A and B sites of the bipartite lattice form SUSY partners. We then
study the system containing loss and gain with saturation. The Jackiw-Rebbi
mode is extended to a nonlinear theory, where B sites are also excited. The
relative phases between A and B sites are fixed, and hence it will serve as a
large area coherent laser.

We find novel polar orders that yield electron (e-) and hole (h+) gas and
depend on surface terminations, using density functional theory (DFT) that,
unlike existing reports, relaxed all the ion positions of ATiO3 having
spontaneous polarization Ps (A: alkali earth metal). By the experiments of
atomic-oxygen cleaned surfaces of BaTiO3, we find both e- and h+ gas that are
proven to originate from Ps and constrain electrostatic potential, which has
been missing. These experiments that remarkably agree with the DFTs of defect
free BaTiO3 reveal the properties of Ps-originated e-h+ and, for ferroelectric
basics, an e-h+-posed intrinsic constraint on depolarization field arising from
Ps in proper time ranges.

<br>
Observation of interlayer, charge-transfer (CT) excitons in van der Waals
heterostructures (vdWHs) based on 2D-2D systems has been well investigated.
While conceptually interesting, these charge transfer excitons are highly
delocalized and spatially localizing them requires twisting layers at very
specific angles. This issue of localizing the CT excitons can be overcome via
making mixed dimensional vdWHs (MDHs) where one of the components is a
spatially quantum confined medium. Here, we demonstrate the formation of CT
excitons in a 2D/quasi-2D system comprising MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayers and
CdSe/CdS based core/shell nanoplates (NPLs). Spectral signatures of CT excitons
in our MDHs were resolved locally at the 2D/single-NPL heterointerface using
tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) at room temperature. By varying both the
2D material, the shell thickness of the NPLs, and applying out-of-plane
electric field, the exciton resonance energy was tuned by up to 120 meV. Our
finding is a significant step towards the realization of highly tunable
MDH-based next generation photonic devices.

The search for the experimental evidence of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states
is critical but extremely challenging, as the quenched interaction randomness
introduced by structural imperfection is usually inevitable in real materials.
YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6.5}$Br$_{2.5}$ (YCOB) is a spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg
antiferromagnet (KHA) with strong coupling of $\langle J_1\rangle\sim$ 51 K but
without conventional magnetic freezing down to 50 mK $\sim$ 0.001$\langle
J_1\rangle$. Here, we report a Br nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the
local spin susceptibility and dynamics on the single crystal of YCOB. The
temperature dependence of NMR main-line shifts and broadening can be well
understood within the frame of the KHA model with randomly distributed hexagons
of alternate exchanges, compatible with the formation of a randomness-induced
QSL state at low temperatures. The in-plane spin fluctuations as measured by
the spin-lattice relaxation rates ($1/T_1$) exhibit a weak temperature
dependence down to $T$ $\sim$ 0.03$\langle J_1\rangle$. Our results demonstrate
that the majority of spins remain highly fluctuating at low temperatures
despite the quenched disorder in YCOB.

Electron tomography offers important three-dimensional (3D) structural
information which cannot be observed by two-dimensional imaging. By combining
annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with
aberration correction, the resolution of electron tomography has reached atomic
resolution. However, tomography based on ADF-STEM inherently suffers from
several issues, including a high electron dose requirement, poor contrast for
light elements, and artifacts from image contrast nonlinearity. Here, we
developed a new method called MultiSlice Electron Tomography (MSET) based on
4D-STEM tilt series. Our simulations show that multislice-based 3D
reconstruction can effectively reduce undesirable reconstruction artifacts from
the nonlinear contrast, allowing precise determination of atomic structures
with improved sensitivity for low-Z elements, at considerably low electron dose
conditions. We expect that the MSET method can be applied to a wide variety of
materials, including radiation-sensitive samples and materials containing light
elements whose 3D atomic structures have never been fully elucidated due to
electron dose limitations or nonlinear imaging contrast.

In past decades, the ever-expanding library of 2D carbon allotropes has
yielded a broad range of exotic properties for the future carbon-based
electronics. However, the known allotropes are all intrinsic nonmagnetic due to
the paired valence electrons configuration. Based on the reported 2D carbon
structure database and first-principles calculations, herein we demonstrate
that inherent ferromagnetism can be obtained in the prominent allotrope,
penta-graphene, which has an unique Mexican-hat valence band edge, giving rise
to van Hove singularities and electronic instability. Induced by modest
hole-doping, being achievable in electrolyte gate, the semiconducting
pentagraphene can transform into different ferromagnetic half-metals with room
temperature stability and switchable spin directions. In particular, multiple
anisotropic Weyl states, including type-I and type-II Weyl cones and hybrid
quasi Weyl nodal loop, can be found in a sizable energy window of spin-down
half-metal under proper strains. These findings not only identify a promising
carbon allotrope to obtain the inherent magnetism for carbon-based spintronic
devices, but highlight the possibility to realize different Weyl states by
combining the electronic and mechanical means as well.

<h3>A class of models for random hypergraphs</h3>

<br>
<i>Marc Barthelemy</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite the recently exhibited importance of higher-order interactions for
various processes, few flexible (null) models are available. In particular,
most studies on hypergraphs focus on a small set of theoretical models. Here,
we introduce a class of models for random hypergraphs which displays a similar
level of flexibility of complex network models and where the main ingredient is
the probability that a node belongs to a hyperedge. When this probability is a
constant, we obtain a random hypergraph in the same spirit as the Erdos-Renyi
graph. This framework also allows us to introduce different ingredients such as
the preferential attachment for hypergraphs, or spatial random hypergraphs. In
particular, we show that for the Erdos-Renyi case there is a transition
threshold scaling as $1/\sqrt{EN}$ where $N$ is the number of nodes and $E$ the
number of hyperedges. We also discuss a random geometric hypergraph which
displays a percolation transition for a threshold distance scaling as
$r_c^*\sim 1/\sqrt{E}$. For these various models, we provide results for the
most interesting measures, and also introduce new ones in the spatial case for
characterizing the geometrical properties of hyperedges. These different models
might serve as benchmarks useful for analyzing empirical data.

<i>J. Fransson</i>
<br>
<br>
The current understanding of chirality suggests the existence of a connection
between structure and angular momentum, including spin. This is particularly
emphasised in the chiral induced spin selectivity effect, where chiral
structures act as spin filters. However, the recent discovery of chiral phonons
have demonstrated that phonons too may carry angular momentum which also can be
regarded as magnetic moments which add to the total moment. Here, it is shown
that chiral phonons may induce a non-trivial spin-texture in an otherwise
non-magnetic electronic structure. By considering a set-up in which electrons
and phonons are interfaced with each other, it is shown that chiral phonons may
transfer its angular momentum into the electron reservoir which, thereby,
becomes spin-polarized. It is, moreover, shown that an equivalent mechanism
does not exist whenever the electrons are interfaced with achiral phonons.

<br>
Phonons are the primary heat carriers in non-metallic solids. In
compositionally heterogeneous materials, the thermal properties are believed to
be mainly governed by the disrupted phonon transport due to mass disorder and
strain fluctuations, while the effects of compositional fluctuation induced
local phonon states are usually ignored. Here, by scanning transmission
electron microscopy electron energy loss spectroscopy and sophisticated
calculations, we identify the vibrational properties of ingredient-dependent
interface phonon modes in AlxGa1-xN and quantify their various contributions to
the local interface thermal conductance. We demonstrate that atomic-scale
compositional fluctuation has significant influence on the vibrational
thermodynamic properties, highly affecting the mode ratio and vibrational
amplitude of interface phonon modes and subsequently redistributing their modal
contribution to the ITC. Our work provides fundamental insights into
understanding of local phonon-boundary interactions in nanoscale
inhomogeneities, which reveal new opportunities for optimization of thermal
properties via engineering ingredient distribution.

<br>
We study the electronic response of Janus transition metal dihalide (TMH)
nanotubes to mechanical deformations using Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
Specifically, considering twelve armchair and zigzag Janus TMH nanotubes that
are expected to be stable from the phonon analysis of flat monolayer
counterparts, we first compute their equilibrium diameters and then determine
the variation in bandgap and effective mass of charge carriers with the
application of tensile and torsional deformations. We find that the nanotubes
undergo a linear and quadratic decrease in bandgap with tensile and shear
strain, respectively. In addition, there is a continual increase and decrease
in the effective mass of electrons and holes, respectively. We show that for a
given strain, the change in bandgap for the armchair nanotubes can be
correlated with the transition metal's in-plane $d$ orbital's contribution to
the projected density of states at the bottom of the conduction band.

Symmetry-resolved entanglement is a useful tool for characterizing
symmetry-protected topological states. In two dimensions, their entanglement
spectra are described by conformal field theories but the symmetry resolution
is largely unexplored. However, addressing this problem numerically requires
system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. Here, we develop tensor
network methods that can access much larger systems and determine universal and
nonuniversal features in their entanglement. Specifically, we construct
one-dimensional matrix product operators that encapsulate all the entanglement
data of two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological states. We first
demonstrate our approach for the Levin-Gu model. Next, we use the cohomology
formalism to deform the phase away from the fine-tuned point and track the
evolution of its entanglement features and their symmetry resolution. The
entanglement spectra are always described by the same conformal field theory.
However, the levels undergo a spectral flow in accordance with an insertion of
a many-body Aharonov-Bohm flux.

Layered semimetallic van der Waals materials TiSe2 has attracted a lot of

having the same crystal structure, shows a semiconducting behavior. The natural
rises what happens at the transition point in TiSe2-xSx, which is expected for
x close to 1. Here we report the growth and characterization of TiSeS single
crystals and the study of the electronic structure using density functional
theory (DFT) and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We show that TiSeS
single crystals have the same morphology as TiSe2. Transport measurements
reveal a metallic state, no evidence of CDW was found. DFT calculations suggest
that the electronic band structure in TiSeS is similar to that of TiSe2, but
the electron and hole pockets in TiSeS are much smaller. The ARPES results are

<h3>Two-gap superconductivity and decisive role of rare-earth $d$ electrons  in infinite-layer nickelates</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, with
transition temperature ($T_c$) up to 23 K, provides an exciting new avenue to
study correlated electrons and emergent phases. Superconductivity in the
nickelates has been mostly perceived to be unconventional and originated from
the Ni $d$-electrons due to its analog to cuprate superconductors. The
conventional mechanism for superconductivity - phonon-mediated pairing - was
presumably ruled out because density functional theory (DFT) calculations
reported a very weak electron-phonon coupling in the nickelates. Here, by
including electron self-energy effects on the electronic structure and
electron-phonon coupling (with $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ calculations), we
discover that infinite-layer Nd$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ is a dominantly
two-gap phonon-mediated superconductor. We show electron correlations alter the
character of its multi-band Fermi surface and also strongly enhance the
electron-phonon coupling, leading to a large $T_c$ in agreement with
experiment. The computed electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ is
enhanced by an unprecedented factor of 5.5 as compared to DFT. Solutions of the
anisotropic Eliashberg equations yield two dominant $s$-wave gaps - a large gap
on states of rare-earth Nd $d$-electron and interstitial orbital characters but
a small gap on those of transition-metal Ni $d$-electron character. The
superconducting quasiparticle density of states prominently reflects the
two-gap nature and explains well tunneling experiments. Our results demonstrate
that the phonon mechanism accounts for superconductivity in the nickelates,
revealing an unforeseen two-gap $s$-wave nature as well as providing new
insights to demystify the similarities and distinctions between the nickelate
and cuprate superconductors.

We achieved a tripling of the maximum range of perpendicular momentum
transfer (q_z) of X-ray scattering from liquid surfaces using a double crystal
deflector setup to tilt the incident X-ray beam. This is obtained by using
Miller indices of the reflecting crystal atomic planes that are three times
higher than usual. We calculate the deviation from the exact Bragg angle
condition induced by a misalignment between the X-ray beam axis and the main
rotation axis of the double crystal deflector and deduce a fast and
straightforward procedure to align them. We show measurements of X-ray
reflectivity up to q_z=7A^(-1) on the bare surface of liquid copper and on
graphene on liquid copper.

Josephson junction circuits, such as superconducting quantum interference
devices (SQUIDs) and single-flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits, have been applied in
both analog and digital systems for their ultralow-noise, high-speed, and
power-efficient features. However, their analyses are not well supported by the
conventional circuit diagrams and the charge-based analysis methods, due to the
Josephson effects and flux quantization phenomena. This article introduces a
type of magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagrams for the design and analysis of
Josephson junction circuits. The MFF diagram of a Josephson junction circuit is
the graphical expression of circuit equations. It not only gives the behaviors
of Josephson junctions and superconducting loops new physical meanings, but
also visualizes how the flux quanta are transferred among superconducting
loops. The advantages of MFF diagrams are demonstrated in the design and
analysis of typical Josephson junction circuits. It is shown that the MFF
diagram and flux-based analysis method are the indispensable complement to the
conventional circuit methodologies for Josephson junction circuits.

Owing to its inherent non-trivial geometry, the unique structural motif of
the recently discovered Kagome topological superconductor AV3Sb5 is an ideal
host of diverse topologically non-trivial phenomena, including giant anomalous
Hall conductivity, topological charge order, charge density wave, and
unconventional superconductivity. Despite possessing a normal-state CDW order
in the form of topological chiral charge order and diverse superconducting gaps
structures, it remains unclear how fundamental atomic-level properties and
many-body effects including Fermi surface nesting, electron-phonon coupling,
and orbital hybridization contribute to these symmetry-breaking phenomena.
Here, we report the direct participation of the V3d-Sb5p orbital hybridization
in mediating the CDW phase transition in CsV3Sb5. The combination of
temperature-dependent X-ray absorption and first principles studies clearly
indicate the Inverse Star of David structure as the preferred reconstruction in
the low-temperature CDW phase. Our results highlight the critical role that Sb
orbitals plays and establish orbital hybridization as the direct mediator of
the CDW states and structural transition dynamics in Kagome unconventional
superconductors. This is a significant step towards the fundamental
understanding and control of the emerging correlated phases from the Kagome
lattice through the orbital interactions and provide promising approaches to
novel regimes in unconventional orders and topology.

We introduce a formalism to describe the electrochemical shot-noise of
surface-attached redox molecules in liquid that is confirmed experimentally.
The proposed method, carried out at equilibrium, suppresses the contribution of
parasitic capacitance, drastically increases the sensitivity and allows to
obtain quantitative information such as the standard electron transfer rates
and the number of molecules. Unlike in solid-state physics, $1/f$ noise is
avoided thanks to near-identical energy molecules. This first step for
shot-noise studies in molecular electrochemical systems opens perspectives for
quantum transport studies in liquid environment at room temperature as well as
highly sensitive measurements for bioelectrochemical sensors.

One hallmark of the Weyl semimetal is the emergence of Fermi arcs (FAs) in
the surface Brillouin zone that connect the projected Weyl nodes of opposite
chirality. The unclosed FAs can give rise to various exotic effects that have
attracted tremendous research interest. The configurations of the FAs are
usually thought to be determined fully by the band topology of the bulk states,
which seems impossible to manipulate. Here, we show that the FAs can be simply
modified by a surface gate voltage. Because the penetration length of the
surface states depends on the in-plane momentum, a surface gate voltage induces
an effective energy dispersion. As a result, a continuous deformation of the
surface band can be implemented by tuning the surface gate voltage. In
particular, as the saddle point of the surface band meets the Fermi energy, the
topological Lifshitz transition takes place for the FAs, during which the Weyl
nodes switch their partners connected by the FAs. Accordingly, the magnetic
Weyl orbits composed of the FAs on opposite surfaces and chiral Landau bands
inside the bulk change its configurations. We show that such an effect can be
probed by the nonlocal transport measurements in a magnetic field, in which the
switch on and off of the nonlocal conductance by the surface gate voltage
signals the Lifshitz transition. Our work opens a new route for manipulating
the FAs by surface gates and exploring novel transport phenomena associated
with the topological Lifshitz transition.

The interplay between quantum interference, electron-electron interaction
(EEI), and disorder is one of the central themes of condensed matter physics.
Such interplay can cause high-order magnetoconductance (MC) corrections in
semiconductors with weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, it remains
unexplored how the magnetotransport properties are modified by the high-order
quantum corrections in the electron systems of symplectic symmetry class, which
include topological insulators (TIs), Weyl semimetals, graphene with negligible
intervalley scattering, and semiconductors with strong SOC. Here, we extend the
theory of quantum conductance corrections to two-dimensional electron systems
with the symplectic symmetry, and study experimentally such physics with
dual-gated TI devices in which the transport is dominated by highly tunable
surface states. We find that the MC can be enhanced significantly by the
second-order interference and the EEI effects, in contrast to suppression of MC
for the systems with orthogonal symmetry. Our work reveals that detailed MC
analysis can provide deep insights into the complex electronic processes in
TIs, such as the screening and dephasing effects of localized charge puddles,
as well as the related particle-hole asymmetry.

Correlation functions of quantum systems are central objects in quantum field
theories which may be defined in high-dimensional space-time domains. The
numerical treatment of these objects suffers from the curse of dimensionality,
which hinders the application of sophisticated many-body theories to
interesting problems. Here, we propose a quantum-inspired Multi-Scale
Space-Time Ansatz (MSSTA) for correlation functions of quantum systems. The
space-time dependence is mapped to auxiliary qubit degrees of freedom
describing exponentially different length scales, and the ansatz assumes a
separation of length scales. We numerically verify the ansatz for various
equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate compression rates of
several orders of magnitude for challenging cases. Essential building blocks of
diagrammatic equations, such as convolutions or Fourier transforms are
formulated in the compressed form. We numerically demonstrate the stability and
efficiency of the proposed methods for the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations.
MSSTA provides a unified framework for implementing efficient computations of
quantum field theories.

Localization in one-dimensional interacting systems can be caused by disorder
potentials or non-Hermiticity. The former phenomenon is the many-body
localization (MBL), and the latter is the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect
(NHSE). In this work, we numerically investigate the interplay between these
two kinds of localization, where the energy-resolved MBL arises from a
deterministic quasiperiodic potential in a fermionic chain. We propose a set of
eigenstate properties and long-time dynamics that can collectively distinguish
the two localization mechanisms in the presence of non-Hermiticity. By
computing the proposed diagnostics, we show that the thermal states are
vulnerable to the many-body NHSE while the MBL states remain resilient up to a
strong non-Hermiticity. Finally, we discuss experimental observables that can
probe the difference between the two localizations in a non-Hermitian
quasiperiodic fermionic chain. Our results pave the way toward experimental
observations on the interplay of interaction, quasiperiodic potential, and
non-Hermiticity.

<h3>Breakdown of detailed balance for thermal radiation by synthetic fields</h3>

In recent times the possibility of non-reciprocity in heat transfer between
two bodies has been extensively studied. In particular the role of strong
magnetic fields has been investigated. A much simpler approach with
considerable flexibility would be to consider heat transfer in synthetic
electric and magnetic fields which are easily applied. We demonstrate the
breakdown of detailed balance for the heat transfer function $\mathcal{T}
({\omega})$, i.e. the spectrum of heat transfer between two objects due to the
presence of synthetic electric and magnetic fields. The spectral measurements
carry lot more physical information and were the reason for the quantum theory
of radiation. We demonstrate explicitly the synthetic field induced
non-reciprocity in the heat transfer transmission function between two graphene
flakes and for the Casimir coupling between two objects. Unlike many other
cases of heat transfer, the latter case has interesting features of the strong
coupling. Further the presence of synthetic fields affects the mean occupation
numbers of two membranes and propose this system for the experimental
verification of the breakdown of detailed balance.

<h3>Ab-initio calculation of the Hubbard $U$ and Hund exchange $J$ in local  moment magnets: The case of Mn-based full Heusler compounds</h3>

<br>
Mn-based full Heusler compounds possess well-defined local atomic Mn moments,
and thus the correlation effects between localized d electrons are expected to
play an important role in determining the electronic and magnetic properties of
these materials. Employing ab-initio calculations in conjunction with the
constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) method, we calculate the strength
of the effective on-site Coulomb interaction parameters (Hubbard U and Hund
exchange J) in the case of X2MnZ full Heusler compounds with X being one of Ni,
Pd or Cu, and Z being one of In, Sn, Sb or Te. We show that the Z element (or
sp element) in Heusler compounds significantly reduces the strength of the
Hubbard U parameter for Mn 3d electrons compared to the elementary bulk Mn. On
the contrary, the effect of the sp-atom on the strength of the U parameter of
Ni, Cu or Pd valence d electrons is not so substantial with respect to the
elementary bulk values. The U values for all transition metal atoms decrease
with increasing sp electron number in the In-Sn-Sb-Te sequence. Our cRPA
calculations reveal that despite their well-defined local magnetic moments, the
Mn-based full Heusler alloys fall into the category of the weakly correlated
materials.

We investigate the interplay of the topological and Kondo effects in a
one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model with nontrivial conduction band using
the density matrix renormalization group method. By analyzing the density
profile, the local hybridization, and the spin/charge gap, we find that the
Kondo effect can be destructed at the edges of the chain by the topological end
state below a finite critical Kondo coupling $J_{K}^{c}$. We construct a phase
diagram characterizing the transition of the end states.

The complex electronic structure of metallic ferromagnets is determined by a
balance between exchange interaction, electron hopping leading to band
formation, and local Coulomb repulsion. The interplay between the respective
terms of the Hamiltonian is of fundamental interest, since it produces most, if
not all, of the exotic phenomena observed in the solid state. By combining high
energy and temporal resolution in femtosecond time-resolved X-ray absorption
spectroscopy with ab initio time-dependent density functional theory we analyze
the electronic structure in fcc Ni on the time scale of these interactions in a
pump-probe experiment. We distinguish transient broadening and energy shifts in
the absorption spectra, which we demonstrate to be caused by electron
repopulation and correlation-induced modifications of the electronic structure,
respectively. Importantly, the theoretical description of this experimental
result hence requires to take the local Coulomb interaction into account,
revealing a temporal interplay between band formation, exchange interaction,
and Coulomb repulsion.

We discuss probabilistic neural network models for unsupervised learning
where the distribution of the hidden layer is fixed. We argue that learning
machines with this architecture enjoy a number of desirable properties. For
example, the model can be chosen as a simple and interpretable one, it does not
need to be over-parametrised and training is argued to be efficient in a
thermodynamic sense.
When hidden units are binary variables, these models have a natural
interpretation in terms of features. We show that the featureless state
corresponds to a state of maximal ignorance about the features and that
learning the first feature depends on non-Gaussian statistical properties of
the data. We suggest that the distribution of hidden variables should be chosen
according to the principle of maximal relevance. We introduce the Hierarchical
Feature Model as an example of a model that satisfies this principle, and that
encodes an a priori organisation of the feature space.
We present extensive numerical experiments in order i) to test that the
internal representation of learning machines can indeed be independent of the
data with which they are trained and ii) that only a finite number of features
are needed to describe a datasets.

The so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which has been
tested in various models by numerical simulations, supplies a way of
understanding eventual thermalization and is believed to be important for
understanding processes of thermalization. However, an analytical proof of ETH
is still lacking. In this Letter, the ETH ansatz is demonstrated for an
arbitrary observable of an arbitrary subsystem in a generic many-body quantum
chaotic system, to which the so-called Berry's conjecture is applicable. In
particular, semiclassical expressions are derived for two unknown functions in
the ETH ansatz.

We study the effective dynamics of ferromagnetic spin chains in presence of
long-range interactions. We consider the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in one
dimension for which the spins are coupled through power-law long-range exchange
interactions with exponent $\alpha$. We add to the Hamiltonian an anisotropy in
the $z$-direction. In the framework of a semiclassical approach, we use the
Holstein-Primakoff transformation to derive an effective long-range discrete
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We then perform the continuum limit and we
obtain a fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger-like equation. Finally, we study
the modulational instability of plane-waves in the continuum limit and we prove
that, at variance with the short-range case, plane waves are modulationally
unstable for $\alpha < 3$. We also study the dependence of the modulation
instability growth rate and critical wave-number on the parameters of the
Hamiltonian and on the exponent $\alpha$.

We study the time delay of reflected and transmitted waves in 1D disordered
media with high transmission. Highly transparent and translucent random media
are found in nature or can be synthetically produced. We perform numerical
simulations of microwaves propagating in disordered waveguides to show that
reflection amplitudes are described by complex Gaussian random variables with
the remarkable consequence that the time-delay statistics in reflection of 1D
disordered media are described as in random media in the diffusive regime. For
transmitted waves, we show numerically that the time delay is an additive
quantity and its fluctuations thus follow a Gaussian distribution. Ultimately,
the distributions of the time delay in reflection and transmission are physical
illustrations of the central limit theorem at work.

AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, K, Rb) are recently discovered superconducting systems
($T_{\rm c}\sim0.9-2.5$ K) in which the vanadium atoms adopt the kagome
structure. Intriguingly, these systems enter a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase
($T_{\rm CDW}\sim80-100$ K), and further evidence shows that the time-reversal
symmetry is broken in the CDW phase. Concurrently, the anomalous Hall effect
has been observed in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ inside the novel CDW phase.
Here, we report a comprehensive study of a high-quality RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ single
crystal with magnetotransport measurements. Our data demonstrate the emergence
of anomalous Hall effect in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when the charge-density-wave state
develops. The magnitude of anomalous Hall resistivity at the low temperature
limit is comparable to the reported values in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.
The magnetoresistance channel further reveals a rich spectrum of quantum
oscillation frequencies, many of which have not been reported before. In
particular, a large quantum oscillation frequency (2235 T), which occupies
$\sim$56% of the Brillouin zone area, has been recorded. For the quantum
oscillation frequencies with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, we further
perform field-angle dependent measurements and our data indicate
two-dimensional Fermi surfaces in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results provide
indispensable information for understanding the anomalous Hall effect and band
structure in kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Superconductor--semiconductor hybrid devices are currently attracting much
attention, fueled by the fact that strong spin--orbit interaction in
combination with induced superconductivity can lead to exotic physics with
potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The detailed
nature of the spin dynamics in such systems is, however, often strongly
dependent on device details and hard to access in experiment. In this paper we
theoretically investigate a superconductor--normal--superconductor junction
based on a two-dimensional hole gas with additional Rashba spin
orbit--coupling, and we focus on the dependence of the critical current on the
direction and magnitude of an applied in-plane magnetic field. We present a
simple model, which allows us to systematically investigate different parameter
regimes and obtain both numerical results and analytical expressions for all
limiting cases. Our results could serve as a tool for extracting more
information about the detailed spin physics in a two-dimensional hole gas based
on a measured pattern of critical currents.

Thermoelectrics as a way to use waste heat, is essential in electronic
industries, but its low performance at operational temperatures makes it
inappropriate in practical applications. Tailoring graphene can change its
properties. In this work, we are interested in studying the transport
properties of S-shape graphene structures with the single vacancy (SV) and
double vacancy (DV) models. The structures are composed of a chiral part, which
is an armchair graphene nanoribbon, and two zigzag graphene ribbons. We
investigate the changes in the figure of merit by means of the Seebeck
coefficient, electronic conductance, and electronic and phononic conductances
with the vacancies in different device sizes. The transport properties of the
system are studied by using the non-equilibrium Greens function method, so that
the related Hamiltonians (dynamical matrices) are obtained from the
tight-binding (force constant) model. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) obtains
for the DVs in all lengths. Physical properties of such a system can be tuned
by controlling various parameters such as the location and the type of the
defects, and the device size. Our findings show that lengthening the structure
can reduce phononic contribution, and single vacancies than double vacancies
can better distinguish between electronic thermal conductance behavior and
electronic conductance one. Namely, vacancy engineering can significantly
increase thermoelectric performance. In the large devices, the SVs can increase
the ZT up to 2.5 times.

Iron-based superconductors, with the ThCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$-type tetragonal
structure (122 family), due to the iron arsenide/selenide layers exhibit
several characteristic electronic properties. For example, multiband character
mosty associated with the d-orbitals of iron and the quasi-two-dimensional (2D)
cylindrical Fermi surface. Moreover, external hydrostatic pressure leads to the
isostructural phase transition from the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal
phase. In this paper, in relation to the iron-based superconductors, we discuss
the electronic properties of novel 122-family member RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ [Liu H.
et al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 094511 (2022)]. We show that the two Fermi pockets
exhibit quasi-2D character. Calculation of the surface spectral function for
the (001) surface shows that the surface states are realized independently on
the surface termination. Additionally, contrary to the iron-based 122
compounds, RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ exhibits extraordinary multiple isostructural
phase transitions under pressure.

Scattering resonances are an essential tool for controlling interactions of
ultracold atoms and molecules. However, conventional Feshbach scattering
resonances, which have been extensively studied in various platforms, are not
expected to exist in most ultracold polar molecules due to the fast loss that
occurs when two molecules approach at a close distance. Here, we demonstrate a
new type of scattering resonances that is universal for a wide range of polar
molecules. The so-called field-linked resonances occur in the scattering of
microwave-dressed molecules due to stable macroscopic tetramer states in the
intermolecular potential. We identify two resonances between ultracold
ground-state sodium-potassium molecules and use the microwave frequencies and
polarizations to tune the inelastic collision rate by three orders of
magnitude, from the unitary limit to well below the universal regime. The
field-linked resonance provides a tuning knob to independently control the
elastic contact interaction and the dipole-dipole interaction, which we observe
as a modification in the thermalization rate. Our result provides a general
strategy for resonant scattering between ultracold polar molecules, which paves
the way for realizing dipolar superfluids and molecular supersolids as well as
assembling ultracold polyatomic molecules.

The Land\'e or g-factors of charge carriers in solid state systems provide
invaluable information about response of quantum states to external magnetic
fields and are key ingredients in description of spin-dependent phenomena in
nanostructures. We report on the comprehensive theoretical analysis of electron
and hole g-factors in lead chalcogenide nanocrystals. By combining symmetry
analysis, atomistic calculations, and extended k.p theory, we relate calculated
linear-in-magnetic field energy splittings of confined electron states in
nanocrystals to the intravalley g-factors of the multi-valley bulk materials,
renormalized due to the quantum confinement. We demonstrate that this
renormalization is correctly reproduced by analytical expressions derived in
the framework of the extended k.p model.

Bi-stable objects that are pushed between states by an external field are
often used as a simple model to study memory formation in disordered materials.
Such systems, called hysterons, are typically treated quasistatically. Here, we
generalize hysterons to explore the effect of dynamics in a simple spring
system with tunable bistability and study how the system chooses a minimum.
Changing the timescale of the forcing allows the system to transition between a
situation where its fate is determined by following the local energy minimum to
one where it is trapped in a shallow well determined by the path taken through
configuration space. Oscillatory forcing can lead to transients lasting many
cycles, a behavior not possible for a single quasistatic hysteron.

Reduced dimensionality leads to emergent phenomena in quantum materials and
there is a need for accelerated materials discovery of nanoscale quantum
materials in reduced dimensions. Thermomechanical nanomolding is a rapid
synthesis method that produces high quality single-crystalline quantum
nanowires with controlled dimensions over wafer-scale sizes. Herein, we apply
nanomolding to fabricate nanowires from bulk feedstock of MoP, a triple-point
topological metal with extremely high conductivity that is promising for
low-resistance interconnects. Surprisingly, we obtained single-crystalline
Mo$_{4}$P$_{3}$ nanowires, a metastable phase at room temperature in
atmospheric pressure. We thus demonstrate nanomolding can create metastable
phases inaccessible by other nanomaterial syntheses and can explore a
previously inaccessible synthesis space at high temperatures and pressures.
Furthermore, our results suggest that the current understanding of interfacial
solid diffusion for nanomolding is incomplete, providing opportunities to
explore solid-state diffusion at high-pressure and high-temperature regimes in
confined dimensions.

An effective two-dimensional two-band model for infinite-layer nickelates
consists of bands obtained from $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $s$--like orbitals. We
investigate whether it could be mapped onto a single-band Hubbard model and the
filling of Hubbard bands. We find that both one-band physics and a
Kondo-lattice regime emerge from the same two-orbital model, depending on the
strength of electronic correlations and the filling of the itinerant $s$-band.
Next we investigate one-particle excitations by changing the screening. First,
for weak screening the strong correlations push electrons out of the $s$-band
so that the undoped nickelate is similar to a cuprate. Second, for strong
screening the $s$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands are both partly filled and weakly
couple. Particularly in this latter regime mapping to a one-band model gives
significant spectral weight transfer between the Hubbard subbands. Finally we
point out that the superconducting phases may have either $d$-wave or $s$-wave
symmetry.

We identify several distinct phases of thermalization that can occur in
periodically driven mesoscopic or intermediate-scale quantum chaotic systems.
In doing so, we also identify a new Floquet thermal ensemble, the ``ladder
ensemble", that is qualitatively distinct from the ``featureless
infinite-temperature" state that has long been assumed to be the appropriate
equilibrium ensemble for driven systems. The phases we find can be coarsely
classified by (i) whether or not the system irreversibly exchanges energy of
order $\omega$ with the drive, i.e., Floquet thermalizes, and (ii) the Floquet
thermal ensemble describing the final equilibrium in systems that do Floquet
thermalize. These phases are representative of regimes of behavior in
mesoscopic systems, but they are sharply defined in a particular large-system
limit where the drive frequency $\omega$ scales up with system size $N$ as the
$N\to\infty$ limit is taken: we examine frequency scalings ranging from a
weakly $N$-dependent $\omega(N) \sim \log N$, to stronger scalings ranging from
$\omega(N) \sim \sqrt{N}$ to $\omega(N) \sim N$. We show that the transition
where Floquet thermalization breaks down happens at an extensive drive
frequency and, beyond that, systems that do not Floquet thermalize are
distinguished based on the presence or absence of rare resonances across
Floquet zones. We produce a thermalization phase diagram that is relevant for
numerical studies of Floquet systems and experimental studies on
intermediate-scale quantum simulators, both of which are limited to finite-size
systems that lack a clean separation of scales between $N$ and $\omega$. A
striking prediction of our work is that certain experimentally observable
quench protocols from simple initial states can show Floquet thermalization to
a novel type of Schrodinger-cat state that is a global superposition of states
at distinct temperatures.
