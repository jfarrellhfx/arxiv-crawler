<h3>Polymeric Liquids in Nanoporous Photonic Structures: From Precursor Film  Spreading to Imbibition Dynamics at the Nanoscale</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00142" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00142</a>

<i>Guido Dittrich, Luisa G. Cencha, Martin Steinhart, Ralf B. Wehrspohn, Claudio L. A. Berli, Raul Urteaga, Patrick Huber</i>
<p>Polymers are known to wet nanopores with high surface energy through an
atomically thin precursor film followed by slower capillary filling. We present
here light interference spectroscopy using a nanoporous membrane-based chip
that allows us to observe the dynamics of these phenomena in situ with
sub-nanometer spatial and milli- to microsecond temporal resolution. The device
consists of a mesoporous silicon film (average pore size 6 nm) with an
integrated photonic crystal, which permits to simultaneously measure the phase
shift of the thin-film interference and the resonance of the photonic crystal
upon imbibition. For a styrene dimer, we find a flat fluid front without a
precursor film, while the pentamer forms an expanding molecular thin film
moving in front of the menisci of the capillary filling. These different
behaviors are attributed to a significantly faster pore-surface diffusion
compared to the imbibition dynamics for the pentamer and vice versa for the
dimer. In addition, both oligomers exhibit anomalously slow imbibition
dynamics, which could be explained by apparent viscosities of six and eleven
times the bulk value, respectively. However, a more consistent description of
the dynamics is achieved by a constriction model that emphasizes the increasing
importance of local undulations in the pore radius with the molecular size and
includes a sub-nanometer hydrodynamic dead, immobile zone at the pore wall, but
otherwise uses bulk fluid parameters. Overall, our study illustrates that
interferometric, opto-fluidic experiments with nanoporous media allow for a
remarkably detailed exploration of the nano-rheology of polymeric liquids.

<h3>Restructuring a passive colloidal suspension using a rotationally driven  particle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00255</a>

<i>Shih-Yuan Chen, Hector Lopez-Rios, Monica Olvera de la Cruz, Michelle M. Driscoll</i>
<p>The interactions between passive and active/driven particles have been
explored as a means to modify structures in solutions. Often times
hydrodynamics plays a significant role in explaining emergent patterns in such
mixtures. In this study, we demonstrate that strong advective flows generated
by a single driven rotating particle near a surface can induce large-scale
structural rearrangements in a passive suspension. The resulting emergent
pattern exhibits an accumulation area in front of the driven particle and a
wake along its trajectory. Notably, the center of the accumulation is found at
a distance from the driven particle. Through experiments and Stokesian dynamics
simulations, we show that the driven-passive interaction is solely determined
by the heights of both particle types, which determines the shape and the size
of the pattern. By modulating the height of the driven particle we can control
the extension of the emergent pattern from 3 to 6 times its diameter ($\sim 12
\, \mu \mathrm{m}$).

<h3>Yang-Baxter integrable open quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00064</a>
<br>
<i>Chiara Paletta</i>
<p>This work is based on the author's PhD thesis. The main result of the thesis
is the use of the boost operator to develop a systematic method to construct
new integrable spin chains with nearest-neighbour interaction and characterized
by an R-matrix of non-difference form. This method has the advantage of being
more feasible than directly solving the Yang-Baxter equation. We applied this
approach to various contexts, in particular, in the realm of open quantum
systems, we achieved the first classification of integrable Lindbladians. These
operators describe the dynamics of physical systems in contact with a Markovian
environment. Within this classification, we discovered a novel deformation of
the Hubbard model spanning three sites of the spin chain. Additionally, we
applied our method to classify models with $\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus
\mathfrak{su}(2)$ symmetry and we recovered the matrix part of the S-matrix of
$AdS_5 \times S^5$ derived by requiring centrally extended $\mathfrak{su}(2|2)$
symmetry. Furthermore, we focus on spin 1/2 chain on models of 8-Vertex type
and we showed that the models of this class satisfy the free fermion condition.
This enables us to express the transfer matrix associated to some of the models
in a diagonal form, simplifying the computation of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The thesis is based on the works: 2003.04332, 2010.11231,
2011.08217, 2101.08279, 2207.14193, 2301.01612, 2305.01922.

<h3>Vacancies in generic Kitaev spin liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00147</a>
<br>
<i>Ihor Yatsuta, David F. Mross</i>
<p>The Kitaev honeycomb model supports gapless and gapped quantum spin liquid
phases. Its exact solvability relies on extensively many locally conserved
quantities. Any real-world manifestation of these phases would include
imperfections in the form of disorder and interactions that break
integrability. We show that the latter qualitatively alters the properties of
vacancies in the gapless Kitaev spin liquid: (i) Isolated vacancies carry a
magnetic moment, which is absent in the exactly solvable case. (ii) Pairs of
vacancies on even/opposite sublattices gap each other with distinct power laws
that reveal the presence of emergent gauge flux.

<h3>What a twist cell experiment tells about a quartic twist theory for  chromonics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00149</a>
<br>
<i>Silvia Paparini, Epifanio G. Virga</i>
<p>The elastic theory of chromonic liquid crystals is not completely
established. We know, for example, that for anomalously low twist constants
(needed for chromonics) the classical Oseen- Frank theory may entail
paradoxical consequences when applied to describe the equilibrium shapes of
droplets surrounded by an isotropic phase: contrary to experimental evidence,
they are predicted to dissolve in a plethora of unstable smaller droplets. We
proposed a quartic twist theory that prevents such an instability from
happening. Here we apply this theory to the data of an experiment devised to
measure the planar anchoring strength at the plates bounding a twist cell
filled with a chromonic liquid crystal; these data had before been interpreted
within the Oseen-Frank theory. We show that the quartic twist theory affords a
slightly better agreement with the experimental data, while delivering a larger
value for the anchoring strength.

<h3>Dynamic Phase Transition in 2D Ising Systems: Effect of Anisotropy and  Defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00153" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00153</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Ettori, Thibaud Coupé, Timothy J. Sluckin, Ezio Puppin, Paolo Biscari</i>
<p>We investigate the dynamic phase transition in two-dimensional Ising models
whose equilibrium characteristics are influenced by either anisotropic
interactions or quenched defects. The presence of anisotropy reduces the
dynamical critical temperature, leading to the expected result that the
critical temperature approaches zero in the full-anisotropy limit. We show that
a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behavior of systems with quenched
defects requires a generalized definition of the dynamic order parameter. By
doing so, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quenched defects lowers the
dynamic critical temperature as well, with a linear trend across the range of
defect fractions considered. We also explore if and how it is possible to
predict the dynamic behavior of specific magnetic systems with quenched
randomness. Various geometric quantities, such as a quasi-electric defect
potential, the defect dipole moment, and the properties of the defect Delaunay
triangulation, prove useful for this purpose.

<h3>Photo-acoustic spectroscopy using a quantum cascade laser (QCL) for  analysis of ammonia in water solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00159</a>
<br>
<i>Apostolos Apostolakis, Guillaume Aoust, Grégory Maisons, Ludovic Laurent, Mauro Fernandes Pereira</i>
<p>Ammonia (NH$_3$) toxicity, stemming from nitrification, can adversely affect
aquatic life and influence the taste and odor of drinking water. This
underscores the necessity for highly responsive and accurate sensors to
continuously monitor NH$_3$ levels in water, especially in complex environments
where reliable sensors have been lacking until this point. Herein, we detail
the development of a sensor comprising a compact and selective analyzer with
low gas consumption and a timely response, based on photoacoustic spectroscopy.
This, combined with an automated liquid sampling system, enables the precise
detection of ammonia traces in water. The sensor system incorporates a
state-of-the art quantum cascade laser as the excitation source emitting at 9
\textmu m in resonance with the absorption line of NH$_3$ located at 1103.46
cm$^{-1}$. Our instrument demonstrated detection sensitivity at low ppm level
for total ammonia nitrogen with response times less than 60 seconds. For the
sampling system, an ammonia stripping solution was designed resulting in a
prompt full measurement cycle (6.35 mins). A further evaluation of the sensor
within a pilot study showed good reliability and agreement with the reference
method for real water samples, confirming the potential of our NH$_3$ analyzer
for water-quality monitoring applications.

<h3>A Pedestrian's Way to Baxter's Bethe Ansatz for the Periodic XYZ Chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00161</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Zhang, Andreas Klümper, Vladislav Popkov</i>
<p>A chiral coordinate Bethe ansatz method is developed to study the periodic
XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All
vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity
conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a
basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of
the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix
techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive
the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies
and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by
Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.

<h3>Mechanical control of quantum transport in graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00177</a>
<br>
<i>A. C. McRae, G. Wei, L. Huang, S. Yigen, V. Tayari, A. R. Champagne</i>
<p>Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro-mechanical
systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum
transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain could completely
turn off the conductivity of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the
superconducting phase of magic-angle bilayer graphene. Here we report
measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene which agree
quantitatively with models based on mechanically-induced gauge potentials. We
mechanically induce in-situ a scalar potential, which modifies graphene's work
function by up to 25 meV, and vector potentials which suppress the ballistic
conductivity of graphene by up to 30 % and control its quantum interferences.
To do so, we developed an experimental platform able to precisely tune both the
mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at
low-temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6 %). This work opens
many opportunities to experimentally explore quantitative strain effects in 2DM
quantum transport and technologies.

<h3>Proximity effect of s-wave superconductor on inversion broken Weyl  Semi-Metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00187</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Dawson, Vivek Aji</i>
<p>Inducing superconductivity in systems with unconventional band structures is
a promising approach for realising unconventional superconductivity. Of
particular interest are single interface or Josephson Junction architectures
involving Weyl semimetals, which are predicted to host odd parity, potentially
topological, superconducting states. These expectations rely crucially on the
tunneling of electronic states at the interface between the two systems. In
this study, we revisit the question of induced superconductivity in an
inversion broken WSM via quantum tunneling, treating the interface as an
effective potential barrier. We determine the conditions under which the gap
function couples to the Weyl physics and its properties within the WSM. Our
simulations show that the mismatch in the nature of the low energy electronic
states leads to a rapid decay of the superconductivity within the semi-metal.

<h3>Modeling of Plasmonic and Polaritonic Effects in Photocurrent Nanoscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00212" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00212</a>
<br>
<i>A. Rikhter, D. N. Basov, M. M. Fogler</i>
<p>We present a basic framework for modeling collective mode effects in
photocurrent measurements performed on two-dimensional materials using
nano-optical scanned probes. We consider photothermal, photovoltaic, and
bolometric contributions to the photocurrent. We show that any one of these can
dominate depending on frequency, temperature, applied bias, and sample
geometry. Our model is able to account for periodic spatial oscillations
(fringes) of the photocurrent observed near sample edges or inhomogeneities.
For the case of a non-absorbing substrate, we find a direct relation between
the spectra measured by the photocurrent nanoscopy and its parental scanning
technique, near-field optical microscopy.

<h3>Anomalous Hall effect with plateaus observed in a magnetic Weyl  semimetal NdAlGe at low temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00222" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00222</a>
<br>
<i>Naoki Kikugawa, Shinya Uji, Taichi Terashima</i>
<p>In the $R$Al(Si,Ge) ($R$: lanthanides) family, both spatial inversion and
time-reversal symmetries are broken. This may offer opportunities to study
Weyl-fermion physics in nontrivial spin structures emerging from a
noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. In this study, we investigated the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in NdAlGe via magnetotransport, magnetization, and
magnetic torque measurements down to 40 mK (0.4 K for magnetization). The
single crystals grown by a laser-heated floating-zone method exhibit a single
magnetic phase transition at $T_{\rm M}$ = 13.5 K, where the $T_{\rm M}$ is the
transition temperature. With the magnetic field parallel to the easy
$\lbrack$001$\rbrack$ axis, the AHE gradually evolves as the temperature
decreases below $T_{\rm M}$. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) reaches
$\sim$320 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 40 mK in the magnetically saturated state.
Except in low-temperature low-field plateau phases, the AHC and magnetization
are proportional, and their ratio agrees with the ratios for conventional
ferromagnets, suggesting that the intrinsic AHE occurs by the Karplus-Luttinger
mechanism. Below $\sim$0.6 K, the curves of Hall resistivity against the field
exhibit plateaus at low fields below $\sim$0.5 T, correlating with the plateaus
in the magnetization curve. For the first plateau, the magnetization is one
order of magnitude smaller than the magnetically saturated state, whereas the
AHE is more than half that in the saturated state. This finding under well
below $T_{\rm M}$ suggests that the AHE at the first plateau is not governed by
the magnetization and may be interpreted based on a multipole or spin
chirality.

<h3>A confined rod: mean field theory for hard rod-like particles</h3>

<br>
<i>Jamie M. Taylor, Thomas G. Fai, Epifanio G. Virga, Xiaoyu Zheng, Peter Palffy-Muhoray</i>
<p>In this paper, we model the configurations of a system of hard rods by
viewing each rod in a cell formed by its neighbors. By minimizing the free
energy in the model and performing molecular dynamics, where, in both cases,
the shape of the cell is a free parameter, we obtain the equilibrium
orientational order parameter, free energy and pressure of the system. Our
model enables the calculation of anisotropic stresses exerted on the walls of
the cell due to shape change of the rod in photoisomerization. These results
are a key step towards understanding molecular shape change effects in
photomechanical systems under illumination.

<h3>Memory of shear flow in soft jammed materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00251</a>
<br>
<i>H. A. Vinutha, Manon Marchand, Marco Caggioni, Vishwas V. Vasisht, Emanuela Del Gado, Veronique Trappe</i>
<p>Cessation of flow in simple yield stress fluids results in a complex stress
relaxation process that depends on the preceding flow conditions and leads to
finite residual stresses. To assess the microscopic origin of this phenomenon,
we combine experiments with largescale computer simulations, exploring the
behavior of jammed suspensions of soft repulsive particles. A spatio-temporal
analysis of microscopic particle motion and local particle configurations
reveals two contributions to stress relaxation. One is due to flow induced
accumulation of elastic stresses in domains of a given size, which effectively
sets the unbalanced stress configurations that trigger correlated dynamics upon
flow cessation. This scenario is supported by the observation that the range of
spatial correlations of quasi-ballistic displacements obtained upon flow
cessation almost exactly mirrors those obtained during flow. The second
contribution results from the particle packing that reorganize to minimize the
resistance to flow by decreasing the number of locally stiffer configurations.
Regaining rigidity upon flow cessation then effectively sets the magnitude of
the residual stress. Our findings highlight that flow in yield stress fluids
can be seen as a training process during which the material stores information
of the flowing state through the development of domains of correlated particle
displacements and the reorganization of particle packings optimized to sustain
the flow. This encoded memory can then be retrieved in flow cessation
experiments.

<h3>Insulator to Metal Transition, Spin-Phonon Coupling, and Potential  Magnetic Transition Observed in Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate LiYbSe$_2$  under High Pressure</h3>

<i>Haozhe Wang, Lifen Shi, Shuyuan Huyan, Greeshma C. Jose, Barbara Lavina, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Wenli Bi, Paul C. Canfield, Jinguang Cheng, Weiwei Xie</i>
<p>Metallization of quantum spin liquid (QSL) materials has long been considered
as a potential route to achieve unconventional superconductivity. Here we
report our endeavor in this direction by pressurizing a three-dimensional QSL
candidate, LiYbSe$_2$, with a previously unreported pyrochlore structure.
High-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman studies up to 50 GPa reveal no
appreciable changes of structural symmetry or distortion in this pressure
range. This compound is so insulating that its resistance decreases below
10$^5$ ${\Omega}$ only at pressures above 25 GPa in the corresponding
temperature range accompanying the gradual reduction of band gap upon
compression. Interestingly, an insulator-to-metal transition takes place in
LiYbSe$_2$ at about 68 GPa and the metallic behavior remains up to 123.5 GPa,
the highest pressure reached in the present study. A possible sign of magnetic
or other phase transition was observed in LiYbSe$_2$. The insulator-to-metal
transition in LiYbSe$_2$ under high pressure makes it an ideal system to study
the pressure effects on QSL candidates of spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ system in
different lattice patterns.

<h3>On-Demand Single-Electron Source via Single-Cycle Acoustic Pulses</h3>

<p>Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are a reliable solution to transport single
electrons with precision in piezoelectric semiconductor devices. Recently,
highly efficient single-electron transport with a strongly compressed
single-cycle acoustic pulse has been demonstrated. This approach, however,
requires surface gates constituting the quantum dots, their wiring, and
multiple gate movements to load and unload the electrons, which is very
time-consuming. Here, on the contrary, we employ such a single-cycle acoustic
pulse in a much simpler way - without any quantum dot at the entrance or exit
of a transport channel - to perform single-electron transport between distant
electron reservoirs. We observe the transport of a solitary electron in a
single-cycle acoustic pulse via the appearance of the quantized
acousto-electric current. The simplicity of our approach allows for on-demand
electron emission with arbitrary delays on a ns time scale. We anticipate that
enhanced synthesis of the SAWs will facilitate electron-quantum-optics
experiments with multiple electron flying qubits.

<h3>Universal Energy Functionals for Trapped Fermi Gases in Low Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00325</a>
<br>
<i>Jiansen Zhang, Shina Tan</i>
<p>We study the system of trapped two-component Fermi gases with zero-range
interaction in two dimensions (2D) and one dimension (1D). We calculate the
one-particle density matrix of these systems at small displacements, from which
we show that the $N$-body energies are linear functionals of the occupation
probabilities of single-particle energy eigenstates. Such a universal energy
functional was first derived in 2011 for trapped zero-range interacting
two-component Fermi gases in three dimensions (3D). We also calculate the
asymptotic behaviors of the occupation probabilities of single-particle energy
eigenstates at high energies. Our method can be applied to other zero-range
interacting systems.

<h3>Effects of domain walls and chiral supercurrent in quantum anomalous  Hall Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00331</a>
<br>
<i>Junjie Qi, Haiwen Liu, Jie Liu, Hua Jiang, Dong E. Liu, Chui-Zhen Chen, Ke He, X. C. Xie</i>
<p>The intriguing interplay between topology and superconductivity has attracted
significant attention, given its potential for realizing topological
superconductivity. In this study, we investigate the transport properties of
the chiral Josephson effect in the quantum anomalous Hall insulators
(QAHIs)-based junction. We reveal a systematic crossover from edge-state to
bulk-state dominant supercurrents, with a notable $0-\pi$ transition observed
under non-zero magnetic flux through chemical potential adjustments. This
transition underscores the competition between bulk and chiral edge transport.
Furthermore, we identify an evolution among three distinct quantum interference
patterns: from a $2\Phi_0$-periodic oscillation pattern, to a $\Phi_0$-periodic
oscillation pattern, and then to an asymmetric Fraunhofer pattern ($\Phi_0 =
h/2e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant, and $e$ the electron
charge). Subsequently, we examine the influence of domains on quantum
interference patterns. Intriguingly, a distinctive Fraunhofer-like pattern
emerges due to coexistence of chiral edge states and domain wall states, even
when the chemical potential is within gap. These results not only advance the
theoretical understanding but also pave the way for the experimental discovery
of the chiral Josephson effect based on QAHI doped with magnetic impurities.

<h3>Anisotropic magnetoresistance in single cubic crystals: A theory and its  verification</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00340</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Miao, Junwen Sun, Cunxu Gao, Desheng Xue, X. R. Wang</i>
<p>A theory of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and planar Hall effect (PHE)
in single cubic crystals and its experimental verifications are presented for
the current in the (001) plane. In contrast to the general belief that AMR and
PHE in single crystals are highly sensitive to many internal and external
effects and have no universal features, the theory predicts universal angular
dependencies of longitudinal and transverse resistivity and various
characteristics when magnetization rotates in the (001) plane, the plane
perpendicular to the current, and the plane containing the current and [001]
direction. The universal angular dependencies are verified by the experiments
on Fe30Co70 single cubic crystal film. The findings provide new avenues for
fundamental research and applications of AMR and PHE, because single crystals
offer advantages over polycrystalline materials for band structure and
crystallographic orientation engineering.

<h3>Thermodynamic bounds on the asymmetry of cross-correlations with  dynamical activity and entropy production</h3>

<i>Jie Gu</i>
<p>Entropy production and dynamical activity are two complementary aspects in
nonequilibrium physics. The asymmetry of cross-correlation, serving as a
distinctive feature of nonequilibrium, also finds widespread utility. In this
Letter, we establish two thermodynamic bounds on the normalized asymmetry of
cross-correlation in terms of dynamical activity and entropy production rate.
These bounds demonstrate broad applicability, and offer experimental
testability.

<h3>Compensated Ferrimagnets with Colossal Spin Splitting in Organic  Compounds</h3>

<br>
<i>Taiki Kawamura, Kazuyoshi Yoshimi, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Akito Kobayashi, Takahiro Misawa</i>
<p>The study of the magnetic order has recently been invigorated by the
discovery of exotic collinear antiferromagnets with time-reversal symmetry
breaking. Examples include altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnets, which
show spin splittings of the electronic band structures even at zero net
magnetization, leading to several exotic transport phenomena, notably
spin-current generation. Altermagnets demonstrate anisotropic spin splitting,
such as $d$-wave, in momentum space, whereas compensated ferrimagnets exhibit
isotropic spin splitting. However, methods to realize compensated ferrimagnets
are limited. Here, we demonstrate a method to realize a fully compensated
ferrimagnet with isotropic spin splitting utilizing the dimer structures
inherent in organic compounds. Moreover, based on $ab$ $initio$ calculations,
we find that this ferrimagnet can be realized in the recently discovered
organic compound (EDO-TTF-I)$_2$ClO$_4$. Our findings provide an unprecedented
strategy for using the dimer degrees of freedom in organic compounds to realize
fully compensated ferrimagnets with colossal spin splitting.

<p>We report on spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in bilayers composed of Pt and
magnetic insulator MgFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (MFO) with spinel structure. The Pt
thickness dependence of the SMR reveals that annealing of the MFO surface
before depositing the Pt layer is crucial for a large SMR with better interface
quality. We also found that oxygen pressure during the MFO growth hardly
affects the SMR while it influences on magnetic property of the MFO film. Our
findings provide important clues to further understanding the spin transport at
interfaces containing magnetic insulators, facilitating development of low
power consumption devices.

<i>Hiromasa Wakao</i>
<p>The coexistence of edge states and skin effects provides the topologically
protected localized states at the corners of two-dimensional systems. In this
paper, we realize such corner states in the two-dimensional
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the nonreciprocal hoppings. For the
characterization of the real line gap topology, we introduce the $\mathbb{Z}_4$
Berry phase protected by generalized four-fold rotational symmetry. From the
physical picture of the adiabatic connection, we find that the value of the
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ Berry predicts the position of edge states. Additionally, by
using the winding number, we characterize the point gap topology of the edge
spectra. From the results of these characterizations by the first-order
topological invariants, we find that the pair of values of the $\mathbb{Z}_4$
Berry phase and the winging number yields the position of the topologically
protected localized states.

<h3>Magneto-transport in the monolayer MoS2 material system for  high-performance field-effect transistor applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00378" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00378</a>
<br>
<i>Anup Kumar Mandia, Rohit Kumar, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Bhaskaran Muralidharan</i>
<p>Electronic transport in monolayer MoS2 is significantly constrained by
several extrinsic factors despite showing good prospects as a transistor
channel material. Our paper aims to unveil the underlying mechanisms of the
electrical and magneto-transport in monolayer MoS2. In order to quantitatively
interpret the magneto-transport behavior of monolayer MoS2 on different
substrate materials, identify the underlying bottlenecks, and provide
guidelines for subsequent improvements, we present a deep analysis of the
magneto-transport properties in the diffusive limit. Our calculations are
performed on suspended monolayer MoS2 and MoS2 on different substrate materials
taking into account remote impurity and the intrinsic and extrinsic phonon
scattering mechanisms. We calculate the crucial transport parameters such as
the Hall mobility, the conductivity tensor elements, the Hall factor, and the
magnetoresistance over a wide range of temperatures, carrier concentrations,
and magnetic fields. The Hall factor being a key quantity for calculating the
carrier concentration and drift mobility, we show that for suspended monolayer
MoS2 at room temperature, the Hall factor value is around 1.43 for magnetic
fields ranging from 0.001 to 1 Tesla, which deviates significantly from the
usual value of unity. In contrast, the Hall factor for various substrates
approaches the ideal value of unity and remains stable in response to the
magnetic field and temperature. We also show that the MoS2 over an Al2O3
substrate is a good choice for the Hall effect detector. Moreover, the
magnetoresistance increases with an increase in magnetic field strength for
smaller magnetic fields before reaching saturation at higher magnetic fields.
The presented theoretical model quantitatively captures the scaling of mobility
and various magnetoresistance coefficients with temperature, carrier densities
and magnetic fields.

<h3>Super Fermi polaron and Nagaoka ferromagnetism in a two-dimesnional  square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00385" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00385</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Hu, Jia Wang, Xia-Ji Liu</i>
<p>We consider the Fermi polaron problem of an impurity hopping around a
two-dimensional square lattice and interacting with a sea of fermions at given
filling factor. When the interaction is attractive, we find standard Fermi
polaron quasiparticles, categorized as attractive polarons and repulsive
polarons. When the interaction becomes repulsive, interestingly, we observe an
unconventional highly-excited polaron quasiparticle, sharply peaked at the
corner of the first Brillouin zone with momentum \mathbf{k}=(\pm\pi,\pm\pi).
This super Fermi polaron branch arises from the dressing of the impurity's
motion with holes, instead of particles of fermions. We show that super Fermi
polarons become increasingly well-defined with increasing impurity-fermion
repulsions and might be considered as a precursor of Nagaoka ferromagnetism,
which would appear at sufficiently large repulsions and at large filling
factors. We also investigate the temperature-dependence of super Fermi polarons
and find that they are thermally robust against the significant increase in
temperature.

<p>High pressure neutron diffraction is employed to investigate the magnetic
behavior of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ in extreme conditions. In contrast to
antiferromagnetic ordering on Mn atoms reported at ambient pressure, our
results reveal that at high pressure, incommensurate spiral spin order emerges
due to the interplay between magnetism on the Mn atoms and strong spin-orbit
coupling on the Bi atoms: sinusoidal spin order is observed at pressures as
high as 7.4 GPa. Competing antiferromagnetic order is observed at different
temperatures in the partially frustrated lattice. This research provides a
unique toolbox for conducting experimental magnetic and spin dynamics studies
on magnetic quantum materials via high pressure neutron diffraction.

<br>
<i>Jingman Pang, Xiaohang Niu, Hong Jian Zhao, Yun Zhang, Laurent Bellaiche</i>
<p>The realization of magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) magnets holds
great promise for both fundamental research and device applications. Despite
recent progress, two-dimensional skyrmion hosts are still limited, due to the
fact that most 2D magnets are centrosymmetric and thus lack
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We show here, using a general analysis
based on symmetry, that Bloch-type skyrmions can, in fact, be stabilized in 2D
magnets, due to the interplay between in-plane component (dx) of second
nearest-neighbor DMI and magnetic anisotropy. Its validity is demonstrated in
the Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayer, which is also verified by recent experiments. Our work
gives a clear direction for experimental studies of 2D magnetic materials to
stabilize skyrmions and should greatly enrich the research on magnetic
skyrmions in 2D lattices.

<p>The recent discovery of the persistence of long-range magnetic order when van
der Waals layered magnets are thinned towards the monolayer limit has provided
a tunable platform for the engineering of novel magnetic structures and
devices. Here, we study the evolution of the electronic structure of CrGeTe$_3$
as a function of electron doping in the surface layer. From angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we observe spectroscopic fingerprints that this
electron doping drives a marked increase in $T_\mathrm{C}$, reaching values
more than double that of the undoped material, in agreement with recent studies
using electrostatic gating. Together with density functional theory
calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that, surprisingly, the
increased $T_\mathrm{C}$ is mediated by the population of spin-minority Cr
$t_{2g}$ states, forming a half-metallic 2D electron gas at the surface. We
show how this promotes a novel variant of double exchange, and unlocks a
significant influence of the Ge -- which was previously thought to be
electronically inert in this system -- in mediating Cr-Cr exchange.

<p>We report the development of a continuous-wave and pulsed X-band electron
spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer for the study of spins on ordered surfaces
down to cryogenic temperatures. The spectrometer operates in ultra-high vacuum
and utilizes a half-wavelength microstrip line resonator realized using
epitaxially grown copper films on single crystal Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. The
one-dimensional microstrip line resonator exhibits a quality factor of more
than 200 at room temperature, close to the upper limit determined by radiation
losses. The surface characterizations of the copper strip of the resonator by
atomic force microscope, low-energy electron diffraction, and scanning
tunneling microscope show that the surface is atomically clean, flat, and
single crystalline. Measuring the ESR spectrum at 15 K from a few nm thick
molecular film of YPc$_2$, we find a continuous-wave ESR sensitivity of $6.5
\cdot 10^{10}~\text{spins}/\text{G} \cdot \text{Hz}^{1/2}$ indicating that a
signal-to-noise ratio of $7.7~\text{G} \cdot \text{Hz}^{1/2}$ is expected from
a monolayer of YPc$_2$ molecules. Advanced pulsed ESR experimental capabilities
including dynamical decoupling and electron-nuclear double resonance are
demonstrated using free radicals diluted in a glassy matrix.

<p>The interaction of electrons with quantized phonons and photons underlies the
ultrafast dynamics of systems ranging from molecules to solids, giving rise to
a plethora of physical phenomena experimentally accessible using time-resolved
techniques. Green's function methods offer an invaluable interpretation tool
since scattering mechanisms of growing complexity can be selectively
incorporated in the theory. cheers is a general-purpose nonequilibrium Green's
function code that implements virtually all known many-body approximations and
is designed for first principles studies of ultrafast processes in molecular
and model solid state systems. The aims of generality, extensibility,
efficiency, and user friendliness of the code are achieved through the
underlying theory development and the use of modern software design practices.
Here, we motivate the necessity for the creation of such a code and overview
its design and capabilities.

used and conduct a thorough comparison of their effectiveness in capturing
important electronic properties. Based on these insights, we propose a novel TB
model for TMDs designed for enhanced computational efficiency. Utilizing
$MoS_2$ as a representative case, we explain why specific models offer a more
accurate description. Our primary aim is to assist researchers in choosing the
most appropriate TB model for their calculations on TMDs.

<p>Helical molecules have been identified as potential candidates for
investigating electronic transport, spin filtering, or even piezoelectricity.
However, the description of the transport mechanism is not straightforward in
single molecular junctions. In this work, we study the electronic transport in
break junctions of a series of three helical molecules: dithia[$n$]helicenes,
with $n=7, 9, 11$ molecular units, and detail the synthesis of two kinds of
dithia[11]helicenes, varying the location of the sulfur atoms. Our experimental
study demonstrates low conductance values that remain similar across different
biases and molecules. Additionally, we assess the length dependence of the
conductance for each helicene, revealing an exponential decay characteristic of
off-resonant transport. This behaviour is primarily attributed to the
misalignment between the energy levels of the molecule-electrodes system. The
length dependence trend described above is supported by \textit{ab initio}
calculations, further confirming the off-resonant transport mechanism.

<p>Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically studied the electronic
band structure of Mn$_3$Ge in the vicinity of the Fermi level. We observe
several bands crossing the Fermi level, confirming the metallic nature of the
studied system. We further observe several flat bands along various high
symmetry directions, consistent with the DFT calculations. The calculated
partial density of states (PDOS) suggests a dominant Mn $3d$ orbital
contribution to the total valence band DOS. With the help of orbital-resolved
band structure calculations, we qualitatively identify the orbital information
of the experimentally obtained band dispersions. Out-of-plane electronic band
dispersions are explored by measuring the ARPES data at various photon
energies. Importantly, our study suggests relatively weaker electronic
correlations in Mn$_3$Ge compared to Mn$_3$Sn.

<i>Yu-Te Hsu, Andreas Rydh, Maarten Berben, Caitlin Duffy, Alberto de la Torre, Robin S Perry, Nigel E Hussey</i>
<p>High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates emerges upon doping the parent
Mott insulator. Robust signatures of the low-doped electronic state include a
Hall carrier density that initially tracks the number of doped holes and the
emergence of an anisotropic pseudogap; the latter characterised by disconnected
Fermi arcs, closure at a critical doping level $p^* \approx 0.19$, and, in some
cases, a strongly enhanced carrier effective mass. In Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, a
spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulator often regarded as a 5$d$ analogue of the
cuprates, surface probes have revealed the emergence of an anisotropic
pseudogap and Fermi arcs under electron doping, though neither the
corresponding $p^*$ nor bulk signatures of pseudogap closing have as yet been
observed. Here, we report electrical transport and specific heat measurements
on Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$ over an extended doping range 0 $\leq x \leq$ 0.20.
The effective carrier density $n_{\rm H}$ at low temperatures exhibits a
crossover from $n_{\rm H} \approx x$ to $n_{\rm H} \approx 1+x$ near $x$ =
0.16, accompanied by \textcolor{blue}{a five-orders-of-magnitude increase in
conductivity} and a six-fold enhancement in the electronic specific heat. These
striking parallels in the bulk pseudogap phenomenology, coupled with the
absence of superconductivity in electron-doped Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, disfavour the
pseudogap as a state of precursor pairing and thereby narrow the search for the
key ingredient underpinning the formation of the superconducting condensate in
doped Mott insulators.

<h3>Longitudinal optical conductivity of graphene in van der Waals  heterostructures composed of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<i>Ruoyang Cui, Yaojin Li</i>
<p>Placing and twisting graphene on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC)
forms a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. The occurrence of Zeeman splitting
and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) changes graphene's linear dispersion and
conductivity. Hence, this paper studies the dependence of graphene's
longitudinal optical conductivity on Rashba SOC, the twist-angle and
temperature. At zero temperature, a main conductivity peak exists. When Rashba
SOC increases, a second peak occurs, with both extremes presenting an enhanced
height and width, and the frequencies where the two peaks arise will increase
because the energy gap and the possibility of electron transition increase.
Altering the twist-angle from 0 to 30$^{\circ}$, the conductivity is primarily
affected by chalcogen atoms. Moreover, when temperature increases to room
temperature, besides a Drude peak due to the thermal excitation, a new band
arises in the conductivity owing to the joint effect of the thermal transition
and the photon transition.

<h3>Phonon-Limited Transport in 2D Materials: A Unified Approach for ab  initio Mobility and Current Calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00577" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00577</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Backman, Youseung Lee, Mathieu Luisier</i>
<p>This paper presents an ab initio methodology to account for electron-phonon
interactions in 2D materials, focusing on transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs). It combines density functional theory and maximally localized Wannier
functions to acquire material data and relies on the linearized Boltzmann
transport equation (LBTE) and the non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF)
method to determine the transport properties of materials and devices,
respectively. It is shown that for MoS$_2$, both LBTE and NEGF return very
close mobility values, without the need to adjust any parameter. The excellent
agreement between both approaches results from the inclusion of non-diagonal
entries in the electron-phonon scattering self-energies. The NEGF solver is
then used to shed light on the "current vs. voltage" characteristics of a
monolayer MoS$_2$ transistor, highlighting how the interactions with phonons
impact both the current magnitude and its distribution. The mobility of other
TMDCs is considered as well, demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed
technique to assess the potential of 2D channel materials in next-generation
logic applications.

<h3>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00611" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00611</a>
<br>
<i>Chen Xu, Yiqi Yu, Peng Zhang</i>
<p>The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the entropy of the coherent-state
distribution function (Husimi function), and is non-zero even for pure states.
We investigate the Wehrl entropy for $N$ spin-1/2 particles with respect to
SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states (i.e., the direct products of spin coherent
states of each particle). We focus on: (1) The statistical interpretation of
this Wehrl entropy. (2) The relationship between the Wehrl entropy and quantum
entanglement. For (1), despite the coherent states not forming a group of
orthonormal bases, we prove that the Wehrl entropy can still be interpreted as
the entropy of a probability distribution with clear physical meaning. For (2),
we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various entangled pure states
with particle number $2\leq N\leq 20$. Our results show that for the large-$N$
($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled
states are much larger than that of the regular ones (e.g., the GHZ state).
These results, together with the fact that the Wehrl entropy is invariant under
local unitary transformations, indicate that the Wehrl entropy can reflect the
complexity of the quantum entanglement (entanglement complexity) of many-body
pure states, as A. Sugita proposed directly from the definitions of the Husimi
function and Wehrl entropy (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). Furthermore, the
Wehrl entropy per particle can serve as a quantitative description of this
complexity. We further show that the many-body pure entangled states can be
classified into three types, according to the behaviors of the Wehrl entropy
per particle in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, with the states of each type
having very different entanglement complexity.

<i>Manoj Kumar Maurya, Tobias Laschuetza, Manjesh Kumar Singh, Debashish Mukherji</i>
<p>Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a generic model, we investigate
heat propagation in bottle--brush polymers (BBP). An architecture is referred
to as a BBP when a linear (backbone) polymer is grafted with the side chains of
different length $N_{\rm s}$ and grafting density $\rho_{\rm g}$, which control
the bending stiffness of a backbone. A BBP is of particular interest due to two
competing mechanics: increased backbone stiffness, via $N_{\rm s}$ and
$\rho_{\rm g}$, increases the thermal transport coefficient $\kappa$, while the
presence of side chains provides additional pathways for heat leakage. We show
how a delicate competition between these two effects controls $\kappa$. These
results reveal that going from a weakly grafting ($\rho_{\rm g} < 1$) to a
highly grafting ($\rho_{\rm g} \ge 1$) regime, $\kappa$ changes
non--monotonically that is independent of $N_{\rm s}$. The effect of side chain
mass on $\kappa$ and heat flow in the BBP melts are also discussed.

<h3>Hyperdeterminants and Composite fermion States in Fractional Chern  Insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaodong Hu, Di Xiao, Ying Ran</i>
<p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) were proposed theoretically about a decade
ago. These exotic states of matter are fractional quantum Hall states realized
when a nearly flat Chern band is partially filled, even in the absence of an
external magnetic field. Recently, exciting experimental signatures of such
states have been reported in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer systems. Motivated by
these experimental and theoretical progresses, in this paper, we develop a
projective construction for the composite fermion states (either the Jain's
sequence or the composite Fermi liquid) in a partially filled Chern band with
Chern number $C=\pm1$, which is capable of capturing the microscopics, e.g.,
symmetry fractionalization patterns and magnetoroton excitations. On the
mean-field level, the ground states' and excitated states' composite fermion
wavefunctions are found self-consistently in an enlarged Hilbert space. Beyond
the mean-field, these wavefunctions can be projected back to the physical
Hilbert space to construct the electronic wavefunctions, allowing direct
comparison with FCI states from exact diagonalization on finite lattices. We
find that the projected electronic wavefunction corresponds to the
\emph{combinatorial hyperdeterminant} of a tensor. When applied to the
traditional Galilean invariant Landau level context, the present construction
exactly reproduces Jain's composite fermion wavefunctions. We apply this
projective construction to the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system. Experimentally
relevant properties are computed, such as the magnetoroton band structures and
quantum numbers.

<i>Kok Wai Lee, Pei-Hao Fu, Yee Sin Ang</i>
<p>We study the topological properties of the Haldane and modified Haldane
models in $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattice. The band structures and phase diagrams of
the system are investigated. Individually, each model undergoes a distinct
phase transition: (i) The Haldane-only model experiences a topological phase
transition from the Chern insulator ($\mathcal{C} = 1$) phase to the higher
Chern insulator ($\mathcal{C} = 2$) phase; while (ii) the modified-Haldane-only
model experiences a phase transition from the topological metal ($\mathcal{C} =
2$) phase to the higher Chern insulator ($\mathcal{C} = 2$) phase and we show
that $\mathcal{C}$ is insufficient to characterize this system because
$\mathcal{C}$ remains unchanged before and after the phase transition. By
plotting the Chern number and $\mathcal{C}$ phase diagram, we show that in the
presence of both Haldane and modified Haldane models in the $\alpha$-$T_{3}$
lattice, the interplay between the two models manifests three distinct
topological phases, namely the $\mathcal{C} = 1$ Chern insulator (CI) phase,
$\mathcal{C} = 2$ higher Chern insulator (HCI) phase and $\mathcal{C} = 2$
topological metal (TM) phase. These results are further supported by the
$\alpha$-$T_{3}$ zigzag edge states calculations.

<p>Unraveling the mechanisms responsible for perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal alloys has proven challenging,
primarily due to the intrinsic complexity of the amorphous structure. Here, we
investigated the atomic origin of PMA by applying an approach of voltage-driven
hydrogen insertion in interstitial sites, which serve as a perturbation and
probe in local atomic structure. After hydrogen charging, PMA in amorphous TbCo
thin films diminished and switched to in-plane anisotropy, accompanied by
distinct magnetic domain structures. By analyzing the mechanism behind the
anisotropy switching, we unveiled the decisive role of Tb-Co/Tb-Tb bonding in
shaping the magnetic anisotropy using both angle-dependent X-ray magnetic
dichroism and ab initio calculations. Hydrogen insertion induced a
reorientation of the local anisotropy axis, initially along the Tb-Co bonding
direction, due to the distortion of crystal field around Tb. Our approach not
only shows the atomic origin of Tb-Co bonding in inducing PMA, but also enables
the voltage-driven tailoring of magnetic anisotropy in amorphous alloys.

<h3>Robustness of Quantum Chaos and Anomalous Relaxation in Open Quantum  Circuits</h3>

<br>
<i>Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</i>
<p>Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of
chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos
and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal
dissipative Floquet many-body system. We study the dissipative form factor
(DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of the
random phase model in the presence of arbitrary one-site nonunitary gates
(quantum channels). In the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we
obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates,
with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that,
for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with
two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap
closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite)
time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is ``assisted'' by quantum
chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we
find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close
even in the dissipationless limit.

<h3>Perspective on the Vortex Mass Determination in Superconductors using  Circular Dichroism</h3>

<p>In our previous work, we estimated the mass of an Abrikosov vortex in a
nearly optimally doped YBaCuO film at 45 K using circular dichroism at
terahertz (THz) frequencies. In this paper, we want to underline the relevance
of our method, propose improvements of our experimental approach, provide a
detailed description of the calculations leading to the evaluation of the
vortex mass, and present an explanation of its variation with frequency. We
also partially study the case of a slightly underdoped film deposited on a
different substrate.

<h3>Area Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam  Seeding</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00653</a>

<p>Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing
high-purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre- and
post-processing of a mask to produce structures. This paper presents a novel
maskless patterning technique that enables area selective CVD of gold. A
focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal-organic precursor
Au(acac)Me$_2$ locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer
for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in
the same CVD cycle without the need for clean room lithographic processing.
Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 {\deg}C, over 200 K lower than
standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the
specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately
conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is
demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios
of around 40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same
precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their
surface. Furthermore, they allow for the first time the precise determination
of the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with
an electron beam.

<h3>Optical chiral properties in a large resonant hybrid photonic cluster</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00669</a>

<i>A. D'Andrea</i>
<p>Optical chiral properties of a resonant hybrid photonic crystal (RHPC) are
computed taking into account spin-orbit effect due to light-hole excitons
perfectly confined in 2D quantum wells. The trends of the optical activity,
expressed as a ratio between the absorption intensities of the z and xy
light-hole polaritons, are obtained by computing the optical response in a
rather large N-cluster of elementary cells (N= 34) and for exciton energy, in
resonance with a stationery inflection point (SIP). High values of spin-orbit
interaction (0.7 eV A) produce strong distortions of the optical activity polar
curves that, differently, becomes rather isotropic if the experimental value
(0.14 eV A) is used.

<h3>Magnetic phase diagram and magneto-elastic coupling of NdB$_4$ studied  by high-resolution capacitance dilatometry up to 35~T</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00715</a>
<br>
<i>Rahel Ohlendorf, Sven Spachmann, Lukas Fischer, Frederik Leon Carstens, Daniel Brunt, Geetha Balakrishnan, Oleg A. Petrenko, Rüdiger Klingeler</i>
<p>We report high-resolution dilatometry studies on single crystals of the
Shastry-Sutherland-lattice magnet NdB$_4$ supported by specific heat and
magnetometry data. Our dilatometric studies evidence pronounced anomalies at
the phase boundaries which imply strong magneto-elastic coupling. The evolution
of the three zero-field phase transitions separating distinct antiferromagnetic
phases at $TN=17.2$~K, $TIT=6.8$~K and $TLT=4.8$~K can thus be traced in
applied magnetic fields which provides the magnetic phase diagrams for
$B\parallel c$ up to 15~T and for $B\parallel [110]$ up to 35~T. New in-field
phases are discovered for both field directions and already known phases are
confirmed. In particular, phase boundaries between different phases are
unambiguously shown by sign changes of observed anomalies and corresponding
changes in uniaxial pressure effects. For $B||c$, we find a 1/4-magnetization
plateau in addition to a previously reported plateau at 1/5 of the saturation
magnetization. TN increases for $B\parallel c$ in fields up to 15~T implying
that magnetic moments of the all-in/all-out structure in the high temperature
AFM ordered phase are driven towards the $c$ axis in high magnetic fields.
Uniaxial pressure dependencies
${\partial}T_{\mathrm{crit}}/{\partial}p_{\mathrm{c}}$ of the phase transition
temperatures for magnetic fields and pressure applied along the $c$ axis are
derived from the data.

<h3>Magnetic-field-induced critical dynamics in magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00726</a>
<br>
<i>Christoph P. Grams, Markus Grüninger, Joachim Hemberger</i>
<p>We report on the magnetoelectric dynamics in the linear magnetoelectric
antiferromagnet TbPO$_4$ studied by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. For the
phase transition into the magnetoelectric antiferromagnetic phase at $T_{N}
\approx 2.3$ K, a finite magnetic field $H$ induces critical behavior in the
quasi-static permittivity $\varepsilon'$. Plotting the corresponding anomaly as
function of $T/T_N(H)$, we observe the scaling behavior $\Delta \varepsilon'
\propto H^2$, a clear fingerprint of linear magnetoelectric antiferromagnets.
Above the phase transition, we find a critical slowing down of the ferroic
fluctuations in finite magnetic field. This behaviour can be understood via a
magnetic-field-induced relaxational response that resembles the soft-mode
behaviour in canonical ferroelectrics and multiferroics.

<h3>Ordering Kinetics of the two-dimensional voter model with long-range  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00743</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Corberi, Luca Smaldone</i>
<p>We study analytically the ordering kinetics of the two-dimensional long-range
voter model on a two-dimensional lattice, where agents on each vertex take the
opinion of others at distance $r$ with probability $P(r) \propto r^{-\al}$. The
model is characterized by different regimes, as $\al$ is varied. For $\al > 4$
the behaviour is similar to that of the nearest-neighbor model, with the
formation of ordered domains of a typical size growing as $L(t) \propto
\sqrt{t}$, until consensus is reached in a time or order $N\ln N$, $N$ being
the number of agents. Dynamical scaling is violated due to an excess of
interfacial sites whose density decays as slow as $\rho(t) \propto 1/\ln t$.
Sizable finite-time corrections are also present, which are absent in the case
of nearest-neighbors interactions. For $0<\al \leq 4$ standard scaling is
reinstated, and the correlation length increases algebraically as $L(t)\propto
t^{1/z}$, with $1/z=2/\al$ for $3<\al<4$ and $1/z=2/3$ for $0<\al<3$. In
addition, for $\al \le 3$, $L(t)$ depends on $N$ at any time $t>0$. Such
coarsening, however, only leads the system to a partially ordered metastable
state where correlations decay algebraically with distance, and whose lifetime
diverges in the $N\to \infty$ limit. In finite systems consensus is reached in
a time of order $N$ for any $\al <4$.

<h3>Two band atomic superfluidity in the presence of orbital Feshbach  resonance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00749</a>
<br>
<i>Andrew Vincent, Theja N. De Silva</i>
<p>We study superfluid properties of alkali-earth-like Fermi atomic systems in
the presence of orbital Feshbach resonance. Using a two-band description of the
ground state and excited state and a mean-field approximation of the intra-band
atomic pairing, we investigate the phase transitions and crossover between
superfluid/normal phases. Defining an effective scattering length by combining
both inter-band and intra-band interactions, we derive closed form gap and
number density equations for both ground state and excited state atomic bands.
We find that our zero-temperature analytical results and finite-temperature
numerical results indicate that the system can show smooth crossover between
Bardeen, Cooper, and Schreifer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
superfluidity for atoms in each band. In addition, we find that inter-band and
intra-band interactions can induce quantum phase transitions between BCS/BEC
superfluid states of atoms in one band to that of the other. We anticipate that
our closed form analytical results can be used as a bench mark for future
experimental and theoretical investigations and will have an impact on the
current understanding of two-band superconductors such as MgB$_2$.

<h3>Measurements of nematic susceptibility with phase sensitive nuclear  magnetic resonance in pulsed strain fields</h3>

<br>
<i>C. Chaffey, C. Williams, M. A. Tanatar, S. L. Bud'ko, P. C. Canfield, N. J. Curro</i>
<p>We present nuclear magnetic resonance data in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ in the presence
of pulsed strain fields that are interleaved in time with the radiofrequency
excitation pulses. In this approach, the precessing nuclear magnetization
acquires a phase shift that is proportional to the strain and pulse time. The
sensitivity in this approach is limited by the homogeneous decoherence time,
$T_2$, rather than the inhomogeneous linewidth. We measure the nematic
susceptibility as a function of temperature, and demonstrate three orders of
magnitude improvement in sensitivity. This approach will enable studies of the
strain response in a broad range of materials that previously were inaccessible
due to inhomogeneous broadening.

<br>

<p>Microwave-optical conversion is key to future networks of quantum devices,
such as those based on superconducting technology. Conversion at the single
quantum level requires strong nonlinearity, high bandwidth, and compatibility
with a millikelvin environment. A large nonlinearity is observed in Rydberg
atoms, but combining atomic gases with dilution refrigerators is technically
challenging. Here we demonstrate that a strong microwave-optical nonlinearity
in a cryogenic, solid-state system by exploiting Rydberg states of excitons in
\cuprite. We measure a microwave-optical cross-Kerr coefficient of $B_0 = 0.022
\pm 0.008 $ m V$^{-2}$ at 4~K, which is several orders of magnitude larger than
other solid-state systems. Our results highlight the potential of Rydberg
excitons for nonlinear optics, and form the basis for a microwave-optical
frequency converter based on Cu$_2$O.

<h3>Molecular Dynamics Study of Electro-Osmotic Flow in a Nanochannel with  Molybdenum Disulfide Walls</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00767</a>
<br>
<i>S.M.Kazem Manzoorolajdad, Hossein Hamzehpour, Jalal Sarabadani</i>
<p>The electro-osmotic flow (EOF) in a neutral system consisting of an aqueous
NaCl solution confined in a nanochannel with two parallel Molybdenum disulfide
($\textrm{MoS}_{\textrm{2}}$) walls and in the presence of an external electric
field parallel to the channel walls, is investigated for the first time. The
results indicate that the thickness of the Stern layer grows as the negative
electric surface charge density on the nanochannel walls increases. The Stern
layer becomes thinner as the salt concentration is increased. Moreover, the EOF
occurs under the no-slip condition on the walls. In addition, by increasing the
surface charge density the average of the flow velocity across the nanochannel
initially grows (Debye--H$\ddot{\textrm{u}}$ckel regime) and reaches its
maximum value. Then, by further increasing the surface charge density the water
flow rate decreases (intermediate regime), and gets the zero value and becomes
negative (reverse flow regime) at even larger values of the surface charge
densities. Comparing the results of the previous work wherein the channels are
composed of the black phosphorene walls with those of the present study for a
channel composed of $\textrm{MoS}_{\textrm{2}}$ surfaces, show that for the
latter case the reverse flow occurs at a lower surface charge density and with
a greater value of the peak velocity with respect to the change in the surface
charge density for the former case.

<h3>Exploring kinetically induced bound states in triangular lattices with  ultracold atoms: spectroscopic approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00768</a>
<br>
<i>Ivan Morera, Christof Weitenberg, Klaus Sengstock, Eugene Demler</i>
<p>Quantum simulations with ultracold fermions in triangular optical lattices
have recently emerged as a new platform for studying magnetism in frustrated
systems. Experimental realizations of the Fermi Hubbard model revealed striking
contrast between magnetism in bipartite and triangular lattices. In bipartite
lattices magnetism peaks at half filling, and doped charge carriers tend to
suppress magnetic correlations. In triangular lattices for large $U/t$,
magnetism is enhanced by doping away from $n=1$ because kinetic energy of
dopants can be lowered through developing magnetic correlations. This
corresponds to formation of magnetic polarons, with hole and doublon doping
resulting in antiferro- and ferromagnetic polarons respectively. Snapshots
obtained with quantum gas microscopes revealed formation of magnetic polarons
around dopants at temperatures exceeding the superexchange energy scale. In
this work we discuss theoretically that additional insight into properties of
magnetic polarons can be achieved using spectroscopic experiments with
ultracold atoms. We consider starting from a spin polarized state with small
hole doping and applying a two-photon Raman photoexcitation, which transfers
atoms into a different spin state. We show that such magnon injection spectra
exhibit a separate peak corresponding to formation of a bound state between a
hole and a magnon. This polaron peak is separated from the simple magnon
spectrum by energy proportional to single particle tunneling and can be easily
resolved with currently available experimental techniques. For some momentum
transfer there is an additional peak corresponding to photoexciting a bound
state between two holes and a magnon. We point out that in two component Bose
mixtures in triangular lattices one can also create dynamical magnetic
polarons, with one hole and one magnon forming a repulsive bound state.

<h3>Band alignment of grafted monocrystalline Si (001)/$β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$  (010) p-n heterojunction determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Beta-phase gallium oxide ($\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$) research has gained
accelerated pace due to its superiorly large bandgap and commercial
availability of large-diameter native substrates. However, the high acceptor
activation energy obstructs the development of homojunction bipolar devices
employing $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The recently demonstrated semiconductor grafting
technique provides an alternative and viable approach towards
lattice-mismatched $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based p-n heterojunctions with high
quality interfaces. Understanding and quantitatively characterizing the band
alignment of the grafted heterojunctions is crucial for future bipolar device
development employing the grafting method. In this work, we present a
systematic study of the band alignment in the grafted monocrystalline
Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure by employing X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The core level peaks and valence band spectra of the Si,
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and the grafted heterojunction were carefully obtained and
analyzed. The band diagrams of the Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure were
constructed using two individual methods, the core level peak method and the
valence band spectrum method, by utilizing the different portions of the
measured data. The reconstructed band alignments of the Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
heterostructure using the two different methods are identical within the error
range. The band alignment is also consistent with the prediction from the
electron affinity values of Si and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The study suggests that
the interface defect density in grafted Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructure
is at a sufficiently low level such that Fermi level pinning at the interface
has been completely avoided and the universal electron affinity rule can be
safely employed to construct the band diagrams of grafted monocrystalline
Si/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterostructures.
