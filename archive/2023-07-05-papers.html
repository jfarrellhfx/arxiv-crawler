<h3>OrthoBoXY: A Simple Way to Compute True Self-Diffusion Coefficients from  MD Simulations with Periodic Boundary Conditions Without Prior Knowledge of  the Viscosity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01591" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01591</a>

Recently, an analytical expression for the system size dependence and
direction-dependence of self-diffusion coefficients for neat liquids due to
hydrodynamic interactions has been derived for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations using orthorhombic unit cells. Based on this description, we show
that for systems with a ``magic'' box length ratio of
$L_z/L_x\!=\!L_z/L_y\!=\!2.7933596497$ the computed self-diffusion coefficients
$D_x$ and $D_y$ in $x$- and $y$-direction become system-size independent and
represent the true self-diffusion coefficient $D_0\!=\!(D_x+D_y)/2$. Moreover,
by using this particular box geometry, the viscosity can be determined with a
reasonable degree of accuracy from the difference of components of the
diffusion coefficients in $x$-,$y$- and $z$-direction using the simple
expression $\eta\!=\!k_\mathrm{B}T\cdot 8.1711245653/[3\pi
L_z(D_{x}+D_{y}-2D_z)]$. MD simulations of TIP4P/2005 water for various
system-sizes using both orthorhombic and cubic box geometries are used to test
the approach.

<h3>Polar coherent states in bilayer graphene under a constant uniform  magnetic field</h3>

Symmetries associated with the Hamiltonian describing bilayer graphene
subjected to a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the
bilayer are calculated using polar coordinates. These symmetries are then
applied to explain some fundamental properties, such as the spectrum and the
integer pseudo-spin character of the eigenfunctions. The probability and
current densities of the bilayer Hamiltonian have also been calculated in polar
coordinates and shown to be gauge invariant and scalar under generalized
rotations. We also define appropriate coherent states of this system as
eigenfunctions, with complex eigenvalues, of a suitable chose annihilation
operator. In this framework, symmetries are also useful to show the meaning of
the complex eigenvalue in terms of expected values. The local current density
of these coherent states is shown to exhibit a kind of radial component
interference effect, something that has gone unnoticed until now. Some of these
results that have just been exposed are graphically illustrated throughout the
manuscript.

With their non-Abelian topological charges, real multi-bandgap systems
challenge the conventional topological phase classifications. As the minimal
sector of multi-bandgap systems, real triple degeneracies (RTPs), which serves
as real "Weyl points", lay the foundation for the research on real topological
phases. However, experimental observation of RTP and physical systems with
global band configuration consisting of multiple RTPs in crystals has not been
reported. In this study, we employ Euler number to characterize RTPs, establish
their connection with both Abelian and non-Abelian charges, and provide
experimental evidence for the existence of RTPs in photonic meta-crystals. By
considering RTPs as the basic elements, we further propose the concept of a
topological compound, akin to a chemical compound, where we find that certain
phases are not topologically allowed. The topological classification of RTPs in
crystals demonstrated in our work plays a similar role as the "no-go" theorem
in the Weyl system.

<h3>Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) for out-of-equilibrium  systems and its application to TR-ARPES</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01244" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01244</a>

Efficiently simulating real materials under the application of a
time-dependent field and computing reliably the evolution over time of relevant
response functions, such as the TR-ARPES signal or differential transient
optical properties, has become one of the main concerns of modern condensed
matter theory in response to the recent developments in all areas of
experimental out-of-equilibrium physics. In this manuscript, we propose a novel
model-Hamiltonian method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA),
designed and developed to overcome some of the limitations and drawbacks of
currently available methods. Relying on (i) many-body second-quantization
formalism and composite operators, DPOA is in principle capable of handling
both weakly and strongly correlated systems, (ii) tight-binding approach and
wannierization of DFT band structures, DPOA naturally deals with the complexity
and the very many degrees of freedom of real materials, (iii) dipole gauge and
Peierls substitution, DPOA is built to address pumped systems and, in
particular, pump-probe spectroscopies, (iv) a Peierls expansion we have devised
ad hoc, DPOA is numerically extremely efficient and fast. The latter expansion
clarifies how single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band
dressings, and different types of sidebands emerge and allows understanding the
related phenomenologies. Comparing DPOA to the single-particle density-matrix
approach and the Houston method (this latter is generalized to
second-quantization formalism), we show how it can compute multi-particle
multi-time correlation functions and go well beyond these approaches for real
materials. We also propose protocols for evaluating the strength of single- and
multi-photon resonances and for assigning the residual excited electronic
population at each crystal momentum and band to a specific excitation process.

Ultracold gases of highly magnetic lanthanide atoms have enabled the
realisation of dipolar quantum droplets and supersolids. However, future
studies could be limited by the achievable atom numbers and hindered by high
three-body loss rates. Here we study density-dependent atom loss in an
ultracold gas of ${}^{166}$Er for magnetic fields below $4\ \textrm{G}$,
identifying six previously unknown features which display both a strong
temperature dependence and also sensitivity to the polarisation and intensity
of the light used to optically trap the atoms. This detailed knowledge of the
loss landscape allows us to optimise the production of dipolar BECs with more
than $2 \times 10^5$ atoms and points towards optimal strategies for the study
of large-atom-number dipolar gases in the droplet and supersolid regimes.

<h3>Three-Tone Coherent Microwave Electromechanical Measurement of a  Superfluid Helmholtz Resonator</h3>

We demonstrate electromechanical coupling between a superfluid mechanical
mode and a microwave mode formed by a patterned microfluidic chip and a 3D
cavity. The electric field of the chip-cavity microwave resonator can be used
to both drive and detect the motion of a pure superflow Helmholtz mode, which
is dictated by geometric confinement. The coupling is characterized using a
coherent measurement technique developed for measuring weak couplings deep in
the sideband unresolved regime. The technique is based on two-probe
optomechanically induced transparency/amplification using amplitude modulation.
Instead of measuring two probe tones separately, they are interfered to retain
only a signal coherent with the mechanical motion. With this method, we measure
a vacuum electromechanical coupling strength of $g_0 = 2\pi \times 23.3$
$\mathrm{\mu}$Hz, three orders of magnitude larger than previous superfluid
electromechanical experiments.

<h3>Geometric Stiffness in Interlayer Exciton Condensates</h3>

Recent experiments have confirmed the presence of interlayer excitons in the
ground state of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers. The interlayer
excitons are expected to show remarkable transport properties when they undergo
Bose condensation. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum geometry of Bloch
wavefunctions plays an important role in the phase stiffness of the Interlayer
Exciton Condensate (IEC). Notably, we identify a geometric contribution that
amplifies the stiffness, leading to the formation of a robust condensate with
an increased BKT temperature. Our results have direct implications for the
ongoing experimental efforts on interlayer excitons in materials that have
non-trivial geometry. We provide quantitative estimates for the geometric
contribution in TMD bilayers through a realistic continuum model with gated
Coulomb interaction, and find that the substantially increased stiffness allows
for an IEC to be realized at amenable experimental conditions.

<h3>Josephson diode effects in twisted nodal superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01261</a>

<i>Pavel A. Volkov, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise, Tarun Tummuru, J. H. Pixley, Stephan Plugge, Marcel Franz</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted flakes of high-$T_c$
cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ revealed a non-reciprocal
behavior of the critical interlayer Josephson current - i.e., a Josephson diode
effect. Motivated by these findings we study theoretically the emergence of the
Josephson diode effect in twisted interfaces between nodal superconductors, and
highlight a strong dependence on the twist angle $\theta$ and damping of the
junction. In all cases, the theory predicts diode efficiency that vanishes
exactly at $\theta = 45^\circ$ and has a strong peak at a twist angle close to
$\theta = 45^\circ$, consistent with experimental observations. Near
$45^\circ$, the junction breaks time-reversal symmetry ${\cal T}$
spontaneously. We find that for underdamped junctions showing hysteretic
behavior, this results in a \emph{dynamical} Josephson diode effect in a part
of the ${\cal T}$-broken phase. The direction of the diode is trainable in this
case by sweeping the external current bias. This effect provides a sensitive
probe of spontaneous ${\cal T}$-breaking. We then show that explicit ${\cal
T}$-breaking perturbations with the symmetry of a magnetic field perpendicular
to the junction plane lead to a {\em thermodynamic} diode effect that survives
even in the overdamped limit. We discuss an experimental protocol to probe the
double-well structure in the Josephson free energy that underlies the tendency
towards spontaneous ${\cal T}$-breaking even if ${\cal T}$ is broken
explicitly. Finally, we show that in-plane magnetic fields can control the
diode effect in the short junction limit, and predict the signatures of
explicit ${\cal T}$-breaking in Shapiro steps.

<h3>Symmetry fractionalization, mixed-anomalies and dualities in quantum  spin models with generalized symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01266</a>

We investigate the gauging of higher-form finite Abelian symmetries and their
sub-groups in quantum spin models in spatial dimensions $d=2$ and 3. Doing so,
we naturally uncover gauged models with dual higher-group symmetries and
potential mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We demonstrate that the mixed anomalies
manifest as the symmetry fractionalization of higher-form symmetries
participating in the mixed anomaly. Gauging is realized as an isomorphism or
duality between the bond algebras that generate the space of quantum spin
models with the dual generalized symmetry structures. We explore the mapping of
gapped phases under such gauging related dualities for 0-form and 1-form
symmetries in spatial dimension $d=2$ and 3. In $d=2$, these include several
non-trivial dualities between short-range entangled gapped phases with 0-form
symmetries and 0-form symmetry enriched Higgs and (twisted) deconfined phases
of the gauged theory with possible symmetry fractionalizations. Such dualities
also imply strong constraints on several unconventional, i.e., deconfined or
topological transitions. In $d=3$, among others, we find, dualities between
topological orders via gauging of 1-form symmetries. Hamiltonians self-dual
under gauging of 1-form symmetries host emergent non-invertible symmetries,
realizing higher-categorical generalizations of the Tambara-Yamagami fusion
category.

<h3>Sequential Quantum Circuits as Maps between Gapped Phases</h3>

Finite-depth quantum circuits preserve the long-range entanglement structure
in quantum states and map between states within a gapped phase. To map between
states of different gapped phases, we can use Sequential Quantum Circuits which
apply unitary transformations to local patches, strips, or other sub-regions of
a system in a sequential way. The sequential structure of the circuit on the
one hand preserves entanglement area law and hence the gapped-ness of the
quantum states. On the other hand, the circuit has generically a linear depth,
hence it is capable of changing the long-range correlation and entanglement of
quantum states and the phase they belong to. In this paper, we discuss
systematically the definition, basic properties, and prototypical examples of
sequential quantum circuits that map product states to GHZ states,
symmetry-protected topological states, intrinsic topological states, and
fracton states. We discuss the physical interpretation of the power of the
circuits through connection to condensation, Kramers-Wannier duality, and the
notion of foliation for fracton phases.

For decades, mechanical resonators with high sensitivity have been realized
using thin-film materials under high tensile loads. Although there have been
remarkable strides in achieving low-dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing
high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by
the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a
wafer-scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate
tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This
silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10
GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and
approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC
strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding
quality factors 10^8 at room temperature, the highest value achieved among SiC
resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing
the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of
free-standing resonators. This robust thin-film material has significant
potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological
applications, space exploration and other areas requiring strength and
stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new
possibilities for the use of amorphous thin-film materials in high-performance
applications.

<h3>Extremely Persistent Dense Active Fluids</h3>

We examine the dependence of the dynamics of three-dimensional active fluids
on persistence time $\tau_p$ and average self-propulsion force $f$. In the
large persistence time limit many properties of these fluids become
$\tau_p$-independent. These properties include the mean squared velocity, the
self-intermediate scattering function, the shear-stress correlation function
and the low-shear-rate viscosity. We find that for a given $f$ in the large
$\tau_p$ limit the mean squared displacement is independent of the persistence
time for times shorter than $\tau_p$ and the long-time self-diffusion
coefficient is proportional to the persistence time. For a large range of
self-propulsion forces the large persistence time limits of many properties
depend on $f$ as power laws.

<h3>Efficient current-induced spin torques and field-free magnetization  switching in a room-temperature van der Waals magnet</h3>

The discovery of magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) materials has established
unique building blocks for the research of emergent spintronic phenomena. In
particular, owing to their intrinsically clean surface without dangling bonds,
the vdW magnets hold the potential to construct a superior interface that
allows for efficient electrical manipulation of magnetism. Despite several
attempts in this direction, it usually requires a cryogenic condition and the
assistance of external magnetic fields, which is detrimental to the real
application. Here, we fabricate heterostructures based on Fe3GaTe2 flakes that
possess room-temperature ferromagnetism with excellent perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. The current-driven non-reciprocal modulation of coercive fields
reveals a high spin-torque efficiency in the Fe3GaTe2/Pt heterostructures,
which further leads to a full magnetization switching by current. Moreover, we
demonstrate the field-free magnetization switching resulting from out-of-plane
polarized spin currents by asymmetric geometry design. Our work could expedite
the development of efficient vdW spintronic logic, memory and neuromorphic
computing devices.

<h3>Toward an accurate equation of state and B1-B2 phase boundary for  magnesium oxide to TPa pressures and eV temperatures</h3>

By applying auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, we calculate the equation of
state (EOS) and B1-B2 phase transition of magnesium oxide (MgO) up to 1 TPa.
The results agree with available experimental data at low pressures and are
used to benchmark the performance of various exchange-correlation functionals
in density functional theory calculations. We determine PBEsol is an optimal
choice for the exchange-correlation functional and perform extensive phonon and
quantum molecular-dynamics calculations to obtain the thermal EOS. Our results
provide a preliminary reference for the EOS and B1-B2 phase boundary of MgO
from zero up to 10,500 K.

<h3>Charge-polarization coupling in the nanostructure "thin  Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ film - graphene"</h3>

<br>
<i>Anna N. Morozovska, Maksym V. Strikha, Kyle P. Kelley, Sergei V. Kalinin, Eugene A. Eliseev</i>
<br>
<br>
To describe the charge-polarization coupling in the nanostructure formed by a
thin Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ film with a single-layer graphene as a top
electrode, we develop the phenomenological effective Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire
model. This approach is based on the parametrization of the Landau expansion
coefficients for the polar and antipolar orderings in thin
Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ films from a limited number of polarization-field curves
and hysteresis loops. The Landau expansion coefficients are nonlinearly
dependent on the film thickness $h$ and Zr/[Hf+Zr] ratio $x$, in contrast to
h-independent and linearly $x$-dependent expansion coefficients of a classical
Landau energy. We explain the dependence of the Landau expansion coefficients
by the strong nonmonotonic dependence of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ film polar
properties on the film thickness, grain size and surface energy. The proposed
Landau free energy with five "effective" expansion coefficients, which are
interpolation functions of $x$ and $h$, describes the continuous transformation
of polarization dependences on applied electric field and hysteresis loop
shapes induced by the changes of $x$ and $h$ in the range $0 < x < 1$ and 5 nm
< $h$ < 35 nm. Using this effective free energy, we demonstrated that the
polarization of Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ film influences strongly on the graphene
conductivity, and the full correlation between the distribution of polarization
and charge carriers in graphene is revealed. In accordance with our modeling,
the polarization of the (5 - 25) nm thick Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$ films, which
are in the ferroelectric-like or antiferroelectric-like states for the chemical
compositions $0.35 < x < 0.95$, determine the concentration of carriers in
graphene and can control its field dependence. The result can be promising for
creation of next generation Si-compatible nonvolatile memories and
graphene-ferroelectric FETs.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experiments on the triangular lattice antiferromagnet
FeI$_2$, we consider the presence of the quadrupole moments and their
interactions between the spin-orbital-entangled local moments. In addition to
the anisotropic pairwise interaction between the local moments, the interaction
between the quadrupole moment arises from the interaction of the orbital
occupation configurations. This is argued primarily from the time reversal
symmetry and the different orbital configurations via their exchange paths. We
discuss the implication of these interactions and expect this result to be
complementary to the existing works in this system and other systems alike.

Two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets have garnered considerable interest for
the next generation of functional spintronics. However, many available bulk
materials from which 2D antiferromagnets are isolated are limited by their
sensitivity to air, low ordering temperatures, and insulating transport
properties. TaFe$_{1+y}$Te$_3$ offers unique opportunities to address these
challenges with increased air stability, metallic transport properties, and
robust antiferromagnetic order. Here, we synthesize TaFe$_{1+y}$Te$_3$ ($y$ =
0.14), identify its structural, magnetic, and electronic properties, and
elucidate the relationships between them. Axial-dependent high-field
magnetization measurements on TaFe$_{1.14}$Te$_3$ reveal saturation magnetic
fields ranging between 27-30 T with a saturation magnetic moment of 2.05-2.12
$\mu_B$. Magnetotransport measurements confirm TaFe$_{1.14}$Te$_3$ is metallic
with strong coupling between magnetic order and electronic transport.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements across the magnetic
transition uncover a complex interplay between itinerant electrons and local
magnetic moments that drives the magnetic transition. We further demonstrate
the ability to isolate few-layer sheets of TaFe$_{1.14}$Te$_3$ through
mechanical exfoliation, establishing TaFe$_{1.14}$Te$_3$ as a potential
platform for 2D spintronics based on metallic layered antiferromagnets.

Saddle point search schemes are widely used to identify the transition state
of different processes, like chemical reactions, surface and bulk diffusion,
surface adsorption, and many more. In solid-state materials with relatively
large numbers of atoms, the minimum mode following schemes such as dimer are
commonly used because they alleviate the calculation of the Hessian on the
high-dimensional potential energy surface. Here, we show that the dimer search
can be further accelerated by leveraging Gaussian process regression (GPR). The
GPR serves as a surrogate model to feed the dimer with the required energy and
force input. We test the GPR- accelerated dimer method for predicting the
diffusion coefficient of vacancy-mediated self-diffusion in bcc molybdenum and
sulfur diffusion in hexagonal molybdenum disulfide. We use a multi-task
learning approach that utilizes a shared covariance function between energy and
force input, and we show that the multi-task learning significantly improves
the performance of the GPR surrogate model compared to previously used learning
approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate that a translation-hop sampling
approach is necessary to avoid over-fitting the GPR surrogate model to the
minimum-mode-following pathway and thus succeeding in locating the saddle
point. We show that our method reduces the number of evaluations to a fraction
of what a conventional dimer requires.

We report the fabrication and testing, at 4.2 K, of an SISFS device, where S,
F, and I denote a superconductor (Nb), a ferromagnetic material (permalloy),
and an insulator (AlOx), respectively. The F layer covers about one half of the
top electrode of the SIS Josephson junction and is positioned off-center.
Electric current, I _tr, along the S electrode can change the magnetization of
the F layer in such a way that, for one direction of I_tr, a magnetic flux
penetrates the junction perpendicular to the layers, whereas for the opposite
direction, the perpendicular magnetic flux can be removed. In the former state,
the modulation pattern of the Josephson critical current, Ic, in the magnetic
field, H, may acquire minimum near H=0, and restores its usual shape with
maximum in the second state. These states can be used for building a compact
cryogenic memory compatible with single flux quantum electronics.

In this work we present a comprehensive theory of spin physics in planar Ge
hole quantum dots in an in-plane magnetic field, where the orbital terms play a
dominant role in qubit physics, and provide a brief comparison with
experimental measurements of the angular dependence of electrically driven spin
resonance. We focus the theoretical analysis on electrical spin operation,
phonon-induced relaxation, and the existence of coherence sweet spots. We find
that the choice of magnetic field orientation makes a substantial difference
for the properties of hole spin qubits. Furthermore, although the
Schrieffer-Wolff approximation can describe electron dipole spin resonance
(EDSR), it does not capture the fundamental spin dynamics underlying qubit
coherence. Specifically, we find that: (i) EDSR for in-plane magnetic fields
varies non-linearly with the field strength and weaker than for perpendicular
magnetic fields; (ii) The EDSR Rabi frequency is maximized when the a.c.
electric field is aligned parallel to the magnetic field, and vanishes when the
two are perpendicular; (iii) The Rabi ratio $T_1/T_\pi$, i.e. the number of
EDSR gate operation per unit relaxation time, is expected to be as large as
$5{\times}10^5$ at the magnetic fields used experimentally; (iv) The orbital
magnetic field terms make the in-plane $g$-factor strongly anisotropic in a
squeezed dot, in excellent agreement with experimental measurements; (v) The
coherence sweet spots do not exist in an in-plane magnetic field, as the
orbital magnetic field terms expose the qubit to all components of the defect
electric field. These findings will provide a guideline for experiments to
design ultrafast, highly coherent hole spin qubits in Ge.

<br>
<br>
Doped Iron Chalcogenide (FeCh) superconductors are extensively studied in the
context of topological superconductivity. However, the evidence of topological
surface states in electrical transport measurements of the doped FeCh system is
yet warranted. In the present letter, we performed angle-dependent magneto
transport measurements on a single crystal of a doped FeCh system, i.e.,
FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. A non-saturating linear magnetoresistance (MR) has been
observed under the magnetic field up to 14 T in the normal state of
FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. The MR is shown to possess anisotropy, which indicates
the presence of topological surface states in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$.
Angle-dependent Magneto-conductivity (MC) at low magnetic fields has been
modelled by Hikami Larkin Nagaoka (HLN) formalism, which shows the presence of
weak antilocalization (WAL) effect in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. The observed WAL
effect is found to be 2D in nature through angle-dependent magneto transport
measurements. Theoretical calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT)
are also performed to get more confidence on the presence of topological
surface states in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$.

<h3>Kinetic inductance and voltage response dependence on temperature:  Asymmetric dc SQUID case study</h3>

<br>
Inductance plays a crucial role in the design and optimization of
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) for quantum sensing
applications, since it dictates the sensitivity and coupling ratio with other
circuit elements. In high-temperature superconductors the kinetic inductance,
which depends on both geometry and temperature, becomes a dominant part of the
device's total self-inductance, since their London penetration depth is
considerably larger compared to low-temperature superconductors. In this work,
we use an asymmetric SQUID to investigate the kinetic self-inductance ratio and
voltage modulation depth at different operating temperatures, device geometries
and bias currents. We first validate our approach by comparing our modelled
data with experimental measurements. Then, through numerical simulations, we
show: (i) kinetic inductance dominates for thin superconducting films, while
for thicker films the inductance is less sensitive to temperature changes; (ii)
the voltage modulation depth decreases exponentially with the total inductance
independent of the asymmetry ratio; (iii) narrower superconducting tracks lead
to a broader temperature operation range, $\Delta T \sim 30 K$, while wider
tracks operate in a smaller temperature range, $\Delta T \sim 10 K$, but are
more sensitive to temperature changes; and (iv) the device performance versus
temperature strongly depends on the bias current used.

Crack-template-based transparent conductive films (TCFs) are promising kinds
of junction-free, metallic network electrodes that can be used, e.g., for
transparent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. Using image
processing of published photos of TCFs, we have analyzed the topological and
geometrical properties of such crack templates. Additionally, we analyzed the
topological and geometrical properties of some computer-generated networks. We
computed the electrical conductance of such networks against the number density
of their cracks. Comparison of these computations with predictions of the two
analytical approaches revealed the proportionality of the electrical
conductance to the square root of the number density of the cracks was found,
this being consistent with the theoretical predictions.

Liquid diodes are surface structures that facilitate the flow of liquids in a
specific direction. When these structures are within the capillary regime, they
promote liquid transport without the need for external forces. In nature, they
are used to increase water collection and uptake, reproduction, and feeding.
While nature offers various one-dimensional channels for unidirectional
transport, networks with directional properties are exceptional and typically
limited to millimeters or a few centimeters. In this study, we simulate, design
and 3D print liquid diode networks consisting of hundreds of unit cells. We
provide structural and wettability guidelines for directional transport of
liquids through these networks, and introduce percolation theory in order to
identify the threshold between a connected network, which allows fluid to reach
specific points, and a disconnected network. By constructing well-defined
networks that combine uni- and bi-directional pathways, we experimentally
demonstrate the applicability of models describing isotropically directed
percolation. By varying the surface structure and the solid-liquid interfacial
tension, we precisely control the portion of liquid diodes and bidirectional
connections in the network and follow the flow evolution. We are, therefore,
able to accurately predict the network permeability and the liquid's final
state. These guidelines are highly promising for the development of structures
for spontaneous, yet predictable, directional liquid transport.

<h3>Magnonic Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
We carried out numerical simulations of propagation of spin waves (magnons in
quantum language) in a yttrium-iron garnet film. The numerical model is based
on an original formalism. We demonstrated that a potential barrier for magnons,
created by an Oersted field of a dc current flowing through a wire sitting on
top of the film, is able to act as an electrically controlled partly
transparent mirror for the magnons. We found that the mirror transparency can
be set to 50% by properly adjusting the current strength, thus creating a
semi-transparent mirror. A strong Hong-Ou-Mandel Effect for single magnons is
expected in this configuration. The effect must be seen as two single magnons,
launched simultaneously into the film from two transducers located from the
opposite sides of the mirror, creating a two-microwave-photon state at the
output port of one of the transducers. The probability of seeing those
two-photon states at the output port of either transducer must be the same for
both transducers.

<br>
Two-dimensional band dispersion of (2$\times$2) superstructure with Bi grown
on Ag(111), which has been urged as an ultraflat hexagonal bismuthene, is
investigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The
(2$\times$2)-Bi superstructure can be grown on the Ag(111) surface at low
temperatures; it transforms into a surface alloy with a
($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$) superstructure at 300 K. ARPES measurements reveal
the consistency with the band structure of ultraflat bismuthene in previous
reports. The band structure of (2$\times$2)-Bi surface remains unchanged with
decreasing Ag layer thickness, indicating the limited penetration of Bi
p-orbitals into the Ag layer.

<br>
<i>Auguste Tetenoire, J. I. Juaristi, M. Alducin</i>
<br>
<br>
The role played by electronic and phononic excitations in the femtosecond
laser induced desorption and oxidation of CO coadsorbed with O on Ru(0001) is
investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics with electronic friction. To
this aim, simulations that account for both kind of excitations and that only
consider electronic excitations are performed. Results for three different
surface coverages are obtained. We unequivocally demonstrate that CO desorption
is governed by phononic excitations. In the case of oxidation the low
statistics does not allow to give a categorical answer. However, the analysis
of the adsorbates kinetic energy gain and displacements strongly suggest that
phononic excitations and surface distortion also play an important role in the
oxidation process.

<br>
The increased time- and length-scale of classical molecular dynamics
simulations have led to raw data flows surpassing storage capacities,
necessitating on-the-fly integration of structural analysis algorithms. As a
result, algorithms must be computationally efficient, accurate, and stable at
finite temperature to reliably extract the relevant features of the data at
simulation time. In this work, we leverage spectral descriptors to encode local
atomic environments and build crystal structure classification models. In
addition to the classical way spectral descriptors are computed, i.e. over a
fixed radius neighborhood sphere around a central atom, we propose an extension
to make them independent from the material's density. Models are trained on
defect-free crystal structures with moderate thermal noise and elastic
deformation, using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method for
dimensionality reduction and logistic regression (LR) for subsequent
classification. The proposed classification model is intentionally designed to
be simple, incorporating only a limited number of parameters. This deliberate
simplicity enables the model to be trained effectively even when working with
small databases. Despite the limited training data, the model still
demonstrates inherent transferability, making it applicable to a broader range
of scenarios and datasets. The accuracy of our models in extreme conditions is
compared to traditional algorithms from the literature, namely adaptive common
neighbor analysis (a-CNA), polyhedral template matching (PTM) and diamond
structure identification (IDS). Finally, we showcase two applications of our
method: tracking a solid-solid BCC-to-HCP phase transformation in Zirconium at
high pressure up to high temperature, and visualizing stress-induced
dislocation loop expansion in single crystal FCC Aluminum containing a
Frank-Read source, at high temperature.

Here we describe an efficient numerical implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation to obtain the excitonic spectrum of semiconductors. This is done on
the electronic structure calculated either at the simplest tight-binding level
or through density funcional theory calculations based on local orbitals. We
use a simplified model for the electron-electron interactions which considers
atomic orbitals as point-like orbitals and a phenomenological screening. The
optical conductivity can then be optionally computed within the Kubo formalism.
Our results for paradigmatic two-dimensional materials such as hBN and MoS2,
when compared with those of more sophisticated first-principles methods, are
excellent and envision a practical use of our implementation beyond the
computational limitations of such methods.

Thin Ge layers deposited on Si(105) form a stable single-domain film
structure with large terraces and rebonded-step surface termination, thus
realizing an extended and ordered Ge/Si planar hetero-junction. At the coverage
of four Ge monolayers angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals the
presence of two-dimensional surface and film bands displaying energy-momentum
dispersion compatible with the 5x4 periodicity of the system. The good
agreement between experiment and first-principles electronic structure
calculations confirms the validity of the rebonded-step structural model. The
direct observation of surface features within 1 eV below the valence band
maximum corroborates previously reported analysis of the electronic and optical
behavior of the Ge/Si hetero-interface.

We study the transition to synchronization in large, dense networks of

infinite network and all-to-all coupling limit is known. In dense networks of
finite size and link probability of smaller than one, the incoherent state is
meta-stable for coupling strengths that are larger than the mean-field critical
coupling. We observe chaotic transients with exponentially distributed escape
times and study the scaling behavior of the mean time to synchronization.

<br>
The properties of porous glasses and their field of application strongly
depend on the characteristics of the void space. Understanding the relationship
between their porous structure and failure behaviour can contribute to the
development of porous glasses with long-term reliability optimized for specific
applications. In the present work, we used X-ray computed tomography with
nanometric resolution (nano-CT) to image a controlled pore glass (CPG) with 400
nm-sized pores whilst undergoing uniaxial compression in-situ to emulate a
stress process. Our results show that in-situ nano-CT provides an ideal
platform for identifying the mechanisms of damage within glass with pores of
400 nm, as it allowed the tracking of the pores and struts change of shape
during compression until specimen failure. We have also applied computational
tools to quantify the microstructural changes within the CPG sample by mapping
the displacements and strain fields, and to numerically simulate the behaviour
of the CPG using a Fast Fourier Transform/phase-field method. Both experimental
and numerical data show local shear deformation, organized along bands,
consistent with the appearance and propagation of +/- 45 degrees cracks.

<h3>From single-particle to many-body mobility edges and the fate of  overlapped spectra in coupled disorder models</h3>

<br>
<br>
Mobility edge (ME) has played an essential role in disordered models.
However, while this concept has been well established in disordered
single-particle models, its existence in disordered many-body models is still
under controversy. Here, a general approach based on coupling between extended
and localized states in their overlapped spectra for ME is presented. We show
that in the one-dimensional (1d) disordered single-particle models, all states
are localized by direct coupling between them. However, in $d \ge 2$ disordered
single-particle and 1d disordered many-body models, the resonant hybridization
between these states in their overlapped spectra makes all states be extended,
while these in the un-overlapped spectra are unchanged, leading to tunable MEs.
We propose several models, including two disordered many-body spin models, to
verify this mechanism. Our results establish a unified mechanism for MEs and
demonstrate its universality in single-particle and many-body models, which
opens an intriguing avenue for the realization and verification of MEs in
many-body localization.

Quasi-crystals are aperiodic structures that present crystallographic
properties which are not compatible with that of a single unit cell. Their
revolutionary discovery in a metallic alloy, less than three decades ago, has
required a full reconsideration of what we defined as a crystal structure.
Surprisingly, quasi-crystalline structures have been discovered also at much
larger length scales in different microscopic systems for which the size of
elementary building blocks ranges between the nanometric to the micrometric
scale. Here, we report the first experimental observation of spontaneous
quasi-crystal self-assembly at the millimetric scale. This result is obtained
in a fully athermal system of macroscopic spherical grains vibrated on a
substrate. Starting from a liquid-like disordered phase, the grains begin to
locally arrange into three types of squared and triangular tiles that
eventually align, forming 8-fold symmetric quasi-crystal that has been
predicted in simulation but not yet observed experimentally in non-atomic
systems. These results are not only the proof of a novel route to spontaneously
assemble quasi-crystals but are of fundamental interest for the connection
between equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics.

<br>
Cu-based argyrodites have gained much attention as a new class of
thermoelectric materials for energy harvesting. However, the phase transition
occurring in these materials and low energy conversion performance limited
their broad application in thermoelectric converters. In this work, we disclose
a newly discovered highly efficient Cu8SiSxSe6-x argyrodite with stabilized
high-symmetry cubic phase at above 282 K opening the practical potential of
this material for the mid-temperature region applications. The temperature
range broadening of the high-symmetry phase existence was possible due to the
successful substitution of Se with S in Cu8SiSxSe6-x, which enhances the
configurational entropy. The developed argyrodites show excellent
thermoelectric performance thanks to the increased density of states effective
mass and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Further tuning of the carrier
concentration through the Cu-deviation improves the thermoelectric performance
significantly. The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT and
estimated energy conversion efficiency {\eta} for Cu7.95SiS3Se3 achieve
outstanding values of the 1.45 and 13 %, respectively, offering this argyrodite
as a low-cost and Te-free alternative for the thermoelectric energy conversion
applications.

The reactivity of silicates in an aqueous solution is relevant to various
chemistries ranging from silicate minerals in geology, to the C-S-H phase in
cement, nanoporous zeolite catalysts, or highly porous precipitated silica.
While simulations of chemical reactions can provide insight at the molecular
level, balancing accuracy and scale in reactive simulations in the condensed
phase is a challenge. Here, we demonstrate how a machine-learning reactive
interatomic potential can accurately capture silicate-water reactivity. The
model was trained on a new dataset comprising 400,000 energies and forces of
molecular clusters at the $\omega$-B97XD def2-TVZP level. To ensure the
robustness of the model, we introduce a new and general active learning
strategy based on the attribution of the model uncertainty, that automatically
isolates uncertain regions of bulk simulations to be calculated as small-sized
clusters. Our trained potential is found to reproduce static and dynamic
properties of liquid water and solid crystalline silicates, despite having been
trained exclusively on cluster data. Furthermore, we utilize enhanced sampling
simulations to recover the self-ionization reactivity of water accurately, and
the acidity of silicate oligomers, and lastly study the silicate dimerization
reaction in a water solution at neutral conditions and find that the reaction
occurs through a flanking mechanism.

We numerically study the transport properties of a two-dimensional Fermi gas
in a weakly and strongly interacting regimes, in the range of temperatures
close to the transition to a superfluid phase. For that we excite sound waves
in a fermionic mixture by using the phase imprinting technique, follow their
evolution, and finally determine both their speed and attenuation. Our
formalism incorporates thermal fluctuations via the ground canonical ensemble
description and with the help of Metropolis algoritm. From numerical
simulations we extract temperature dependence of the sound velocity and
diffusivity as well as the dependence on the interaction strength. We emphasize
the role of virtual vortex-antivortex pairs creation in the process of sound
dissipation.

<br>
<br>
We present Monte Carlo computer simulations for melts of semiflexible
randomly knotted and randomly concatenated ring polymers on the fcc lattice and
in slit confinement. Through systematic variation of the slit width at fixed
melt density, we first explore the influence of confinement on single-chain
conformations and inter-chain interactions. We demonstrate that confinement
makes chains globally larger and more elongated, while enhancing both contacts
and knottedness propensities. As for multi-chain properties, we show that
ring-ring contacts decrease with the confinement, yet neighbouring rings are
more overlapped as confinement grows. These aspects are reflected on the
decrease of the links formation between pairs of rings. The results suggest
that confinement can be used to fine-tune the mechanical properties of the
polymer network. In particular, confinement biases the synthesis of networks
that are softer to mechanical stress. Finally, in connection with a previous
study of us and recent simulations on two-dimensional polymer melts, our
findings suggest that entanglements in polymer melts arise from pairwise
ring-ring links alone.

We investigate the spontaneous emission lifetime of a quantum emitter near a
substrate coated with phosphorene under the influence of uniaxial strain. We
consider both electric dipole and magnetic dipole-mediated spontaneous
transitions from the excited to the ground state. The modeling of phosphorene
is performed by employing a tight-binding model that goes beyond the usual
low-energy description. We demonstrate that both electric and magnetic decay
rates can be strongly tuned by the application of uniform strain, ranging from
a near-total suppression of the Purcell effect to a remarkable enhancement of
more than 1300% due to the high flexibility associated with the puckered
lattice structure of phosphorene. We also unveil the use of strain as a
mechanism to tailor the most probable decay pathways of the emitted quanta. Our
results show that uniaxially strained phosphorene is an efficient and versatile
material platform for the active control of light-matter interactions thanks to
its extraordinary optomechanical properties.

<br>
<br>
Field emission effect is the emission of electrons from a cold metallic
surface in the presence of an electric field. The emission current
exponentially depends on the work function of the metallic surface. In this
work we consider the role of work function distribution on the field emission
current. The work function distribution can arise due to nano-scale
inhomogeneities of the surface as well as for collection of nano-particles with
size distribution. We consider both Gaussian distribution as well as log-normal
distribution. For Gaussian distribution, the field emission current,
$J_{\textrm{av}}$, averaged over work function distribution shows Gaussian
dependence, $J_{\textrm{av}}\propto \exp(\alpha\sigma^{2})$, where $\sigma$ is
the width of the work function distribution and $\alpha$ is a fitting
parameter. For log-normal distribution, $J_{\textrm{av}}$ shows compressed
exponential behaviour, $J_{\textrm{av}}\propto \exp(\gamma\sigma^{n})$, where
the exponent $n > 1$ is a non-universal parameter. We also study in detail
field emission current for various electric field strength applied to systems
with high density, characterised by Fermi energy, $E_{F} \gg \Phi$, $\Phi$
being the work function of the system as well as systems with low density
characterised by $E_{F} \ll \Phi$.

Insights into the fundamental properties of graphene's Dirac-Weyl fermions
have emerged from studies of electron tunnelling transistors in which an
atomically thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is sandwiched between
two layers of high purity graphene. Here, we show that when a single defect is
present within the hBN tunnel barrier, it can inject electrons into the
graphene layers and its sharply defined energy level acts as a high resolution
spectroscopic probe of electron-electron interactions in graphene. We report a
magnetic field dependent suppression of the tunnel current flowing through a
single defect below temperatures of $\sim$ 2 K. This is attributed to the
formation of a magnetically-induced Coulomb gap in the spectral density of
electrons tunnelling into graphene due to electron-electron interactions.

Surfaces are able to control physical-chemical processes in multi-component
solution systems and, as such, find application in a wide range of
technological devices. Understanding the structure, dynamics and thermodynamics
of non-ideal solutions at surfaces, however, is particularly challenging. Here,
we use Constant Chemical Potential Molecular Dynamics simulations to gather
insight into aqueous NaCl solutions in contact with graphite surfaces at high
concentrations and under the effect of applied surface charges: conditions
where mean-field theories describing interfaces cannot be (typically) reliably
applied. We discover an asymmetric effect of surface charge on the double layer
structure and resulting thermodynamic properties, which can be explained by
considering the affinity of the surface for cations and anions and the
cooperative adsorption of ions that occurs at higher concentrations. We
characterise how the sign of the surface charge affects ion densities and water
structure in the double layer and how the capacitance of the interface - a
function of the electric potential drop across the double layer - is largely
insensitive to the bulk solution concentration. Notably, we find that
negatively charged graphite surfaces induce an increase in the size and
concentration of extended liquid-like ion clusters confined to the double
layer. Finally, we discuss how concentration and surface charge affect the

Adding activity or driving to a thermal system may modify its phase diagram
and response functions. We study that effect for a Curie-Weiss model where the
thermal bath switches rapidly between two temperatures. The critical
temperature moves with the nonequilibrium driving, opening up a new region of
stability for the paramagnetic phase (zero magnetization) at low temperatures.
Furthermore, phase coexistence between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
phases becomes possible at low temperatures. Following the excess heat
formalism, we calculate the nonequilibrium thermal response and study its
behavior near phase transitions. Where the specific heat at the critical point
makes a finite jump in equilibrium (discontinuity), it diverges once we add the
second thermal bath. Finally, the specific heat goes exponentially fast to zero
at low temperatures, realizing a Third Law.

<h3>Multiparameter universality and intrinsic diversity of critical  phenomena in weakly anisotropic systems</h3>

Recently a unified hypothesis of multiparameter universality for the critical
behavior of bulk and confined anisotropic systems has been formulated [V. Dohm,
Phys. Rev. E {\bf 97}, 062128 (2018)]. We prove the validity of this hypothesis
on the basis of the principle of two-scale-factor universality for isotropic
systems. We introduce an angular-dependent correlation vector and a generalized
shear transformation that transforms weakly anisotropic systems to isotropic
systems. As examples we consider the $O(n)$-symmetric $\varphi^4$, Gaussian,
and $n$-vector model. We determine the structure of the bulk order-parameter
correlation function, of the singular bulk part of the critical free energy,
and of critical bulk amplitude relations of anisotropic systems. It is shown
that weakly anisotropic systems exhibit a high degree of intrinsic diversity
due to $d(d+1)/2-1$ independent parameters. Exact results are derived for the
$d=2$ Ising universality class and for the spherical and Gaussian universality
classes. For the $d=3$ Ising universality class we identify the universal
scaling function of the isotropic bulk correlation function from the
nonuniversal result of the functional renormalization group. A proof is
presented for the validity of multiparameter universality of the exact critical
Casimir amplitude in a rectangular geometry of weakly anisotropic systems with
periodic boundary conditions in the Ising universality class. This confirms the
validity of recent predictions of self-similar structures of finite-size
effects at $T=T_c$ derived from conformal field theory. This also substantiates
the previous notion of an effective shear transformation for anisotropic
two-dimensional Ising models. Our theory paves the way for a quantitative
theory of nonuniversal critical Casimir forces in anisotropic superconductors.

<h3>From stretched exponential to power-law: crossover of relaxation in a  simple model</h3>

The autocorrelation function in many complex systems shows a crossover of its
decay: from stretched exponential relaxation (SER) at short times to power-law
at long times. Study of the mechanisms leading to such multiple relaxation
patterns are rare. Additionally, the inherent complexity of these systems makes
it hard to understand the underlying mechanism leading to the crossover. Here
we develop a simple one-dimensional spin model, which we call a Domain Wall to
Doublon (DWD) model, that shows such a crossover. The nature of the excitations
governing the relaxation dynamics changes with temperature. The relevant
excitations are domain walls (DWs) and bound pairs of DWs, which we term
``doublons''. The diffusive motions of the DWs govern the relaxation at short
times, whereas the diffusive motions of the doublons give the decay at long
times. This crossover of relaxation mechanisms leads to the crossover, from SER
to power-law, in the decay pattern of the autocorrelation functions. We augment
our numerical results by analytical derivations of the relaxation forms.

<h3>Enhancing Quantum Otto Engine Performance in Generalized External  Potential on Bose-Einstein Condensation Regime</h3>

<br>
<br>
We examine a quantum Otto engine using both Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC)
and normal Bose gas as working medium trapped in generalized external
potential. We treated the engine quasi-statically and endoreversibly. Since the
expansion and compression in both quasi-static and endoreversible take place
isentropic, the expression of efficiency is similar. However, the power output
in the quasi-static cycle is zero due to infinite and long stroke time. In
contrast, with an endoreversible cycle, thermalization with two reservoirs
takes place at a finite time. We use Fourier's law in conduction to formulate
the relation between temperature of medium and reservoir, making work depend on
heating and cooling stroke time. Moreover, we maximized the power with respect
to compression ratio $\kappa$ to obtain efficiency at maximum power (EMP). We
found that EMP is significantly higher when using BEC as a working medium,
meanwhile EMP with normal Bose gas is just Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. We also
investigate the effect of thermal contact time $\tau$ with hot ($\tau_{h}$) and
cold ($\tau_{l}$) reservoir on EMP. We found that when $\tau_{h}=\tau_{l}$
stroke time occur, there are no significant differences. Nevertheless,
adjusting various cooling and heating stroke time provide a significant result
on EMP, which is much higher at $\tau_{h}<\tau_{l}$ stroke time whilst lower at
$\tau_{h}>\tau_{l}$ stroke time. We conclude this partial thermalization
enhances the EMP of the engine due to residual coherence.

<h3>Finite-size scaling of the random-field Ising model above the upper  critical dimension</h3>

<i>Nikolaos G. Fytas, Victor Martin-Mayor, Giorgio Parisi, Marco Picco, Nicolas Sourlas</i>
<br>
<br>
Finite-size scaling above the upper critical dimension is a long-standing
puzzle in the field of Statistical Physics. Even for pure systems various
scaling theories have been suggested, partially corroborated by numerical
simulations. In the present manuscript we address this problem in the even more
complicated case of disordered systems. In particular, we investigate the
scaling behavior of the random-field Ising model at dimension $D = 7$, i.e.,
above its upper critical dimension $D_{\rm u} = 6$, by employing extensive
ground-state numerical simulations. Our results confirm the hypothesis that at
dimensions $D > D_{\rm u}$, linear length scale $L$ should be replaced in
finite-size scaling expressions by the effective scale $L_{\rm eff} = L^{D /
D_{\rm u}}$. Via a fitted version of the quotients method that takes this
modification, but also subleading scaling corrections into account, we compute
the critical point of the transition for Gaussian random fields and provide
estimates for the full set of critical exponents. Thus, our analysis indicates
that this modified version of finite-size scaling is successful also in the
context of the random-field problem.

<h3>Polymer translocation driven by longitudinal and transversal  time-dependent end-pulling forces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01821" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01821</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Polymer translocation has long been a topic of interest in the field of
biological physics given its relevance in both biological (protein and DNA/RNA
translocation through nuclear and cell membranes) and technological processes
(nanopore DNA sequencing, drug delivery). In this work, we simulate the
translocation of a semiflexible homopolymer through an extended pore, driven by
both a constant and a time-dependent end-pulled force, employing a model
introduced in previous studies. The time dependence is simplistically modeled
as a cosine function, and we distinguish between two scenarios for the driving
-- longitudinal force and transversal force -- depending on the relative
orientation of the force, parallel or perpendicular respectively, with respect
to the pore axis. Beside some key differences between the two drivings, the
mean translocation times present a large minimum region as function of the
frequency of the force that is typical of the Resonant Activation effect. The
presence of the minimum is independent on the elastic characteristics of the
polymeric chains and reveals a linear relation between the optimum mean
translocation time and the corresponding period of the driving. The mean
translocation times show different scaling exponent with the polymer length for
different flexibilities. Lastly, we derive an analytical expression of the mean
translocation time for low driving frequency, which clearly agrees with the
simulations.

<h3>Critical dynamical behavior of the Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01837</a>
<br>
<i>Zihua Liu, Erol Vatansever, Gerard T. Barkema, Nikolaos G. Fytas</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the dynamical critical behavior of the two- and
three-dimensional Ising model with Glauber dynamics. In contrast to the usual
standing, we focus on the mean-squared deviation of the magnetization $M$,
MSD$_M$, as a function of time, as well as on the autocorrelation function of
$M$. These two functions are distinct but closely related. We find that MSD$_M$
features a first crossover at time $\tau_1 \sim L^{z_{1}}$, from ordinary
diffusion with MSD$_M$ $\sim t$, to anomalous diffusion with MSD$_M$ $\sim
t^\alpha$. Purely on numerical grounds, we obtain the values $z_1=0.45(5)$ and
$\alpha=0.752(5)$ for the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. Related to this,
the magnetization autocorrelation function crosses over from an exponential
decay to a stretched-exponential decay. At later times, we find a second
crossover at time $\tau_2 \sim L^{z_{2}}$. Here, MSD$_M$ saturates to its
late-time value $\sim L^{2+\gamma/\nu}$, while the autocorrelation function
crosses over from stretched-exponential decay to simple exponential one. We
also confirm numerically the value $z_{2}=2.1665(12)$, earlier reported as the
single dynamic exponent. Continuity of MSD$_M$ requires that
$\alpha(z_{2}-z_{1})=\gamma/\nu-z_1$. We speculate that $z_{1} = 1/2$ and
$\alpha = 3/4$, values that indeed lead to the expected $z_{2} = 13/6$ result.
A complementary analysis for the three-dimensional Ising model provides the
estimates $z_{1} = 1.35(2)$, $\alpha=0.90(2)$, and $z_{2} = 2.032(3)$. While
$z_{2}$ has attracted significant attention in the literature, we argue that
for all practical purposes $z_{1}$ is more important, as it determines the
number of statistically independent measurements during a long simulation.

We study stationary states emerging after global quenches in which the time
evolution is under local Hamiltonians that possess semilocal conserved
operators. In particular, we study a model that is dual to quantum XY chain. We
show that a localized perturbation in the initial state can turn an exponential
decay of spatial correlations in the stationary state into an algebraic decay.
We investigate the consequences on the behavior of the (R\'enyi-$\alpha$)
entanglement entropies, focusing on the tripartite information of three
adjacent subsystems. In the limit of large subsystems, we show that in the
stationary state with the algebraic decay of correlations the tripartite
information exhibits a non-zero value with a universal dependency on the cross
ratio, while it vanishes in the stationary state with the exponential decay of
correlations.

<h3>Boundary Flat Bands with Topological Spin Textures Protected by  Sub-chiral Symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Yijie Mo, Xiao-Jiao Wang, Rui Yu, Zhongbo Yan</i>
<br>
<br>
Chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as
well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands. The
conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a
constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the Hamiltonian. As a constant
unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors, boundary flat bands enforced by
chiral symmetry, which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry
operator, are known to carry fixed (pseudo)spin polarizations and be
featureless in quantum geometry. In this work, we generalize the chiral
symmetry and introduce a concept termed sub-chiral symmetry. Unlike the
conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant, the sub-chiral
symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector, so as
its eigenvectors. We show that topological gapped or gapless systems without
the chiral symmetry but with the sub-chiral symmetry can support boundary flat
bands, which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized Berry phases. We
expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of
exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders.

<h3>Dynamic paramagnon-polarons in altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01855</a>
<br>
<i>Charles R. W. Steward, Rafael M. Fernandes, Joerg Schmalian</i>
<br>
<br>
The combined rotational and time-reversal symmetry breakings that define an
altermagnet lead to an unusual d-wave (or g-wave) magnetization order
parameter, which in turn can be modeled in terms of multipolar magnetic
moments. Here, we show that such an altermagnetic order parameter couples to
the dynamics of the lattice even in the absence of an external magnetic field.
This coupling is analogous to the non-dissipative Hall viscosity and describes
the stress generated by a time-varying strain under broken time-reversal
symmetry. We demonstrate that this effect generates a hybridized
paramagnon-polaron mode, which allows one to assess altermagnetic excitations
directly from the phonon spectrum. Using a scaling analysis, we also
demonstrate that the dynamic strain coupling strongly affects the altermagnetic
phase boundary, but in different ways in the thermal and quantum regimes. In
the ground state, we find that a hardening of the altermagnon mode leads to an
extended altermagnetic ordered regime, whereas for non-zero temperatures, the
softening of the phonon modes leads to increased fluctuations that lower the
altermagnetic transition temperature. We also discuss the application of these
results to standard ferromagnetic systems.

<br>
<br>
In the H-T phase diagram of itinerant metamagnets, the first-order transition
line terminates at the critical end point, which is analogous to the critical
point of the gas-liquid condensation line in the p-T phase diagram. An
ultrasonic study of two itinerant electron metamagnets, UTe2 and UCoAl, in
magnetic fields was conducted to understand how critical magnetic fluctuations
affect their crystal lattices. Sharp anomalies of the elastic constants at the
critical field of the metamagnetic transition become maximized in a narrow
temperature interval around 10.5 K. This temperature corresponds to the
critical end point. We attribute these anomalies to lattice instabilities
induced by critical magnetic fluctuations via the strong magnetoelastic
interaction. The observed anisotropy of the anomaly is discussed in connection
with the anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations.

The developing field of strain-induced magnetization dynamics offers a
promising path toward efficiently controlling spins and phase transitions.
Understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial in finding the optimal
parameters supporting the phononic switching of magnetization. Here, we present
an experimental and numerical study of time-resolved magnetization dynamics
driven by the resonant excitation of an optical phonon mode in iron garnets.
Upon pumping the latter with an infrared pulse obtained from a free-electron
laser, we observe spatially-varying magnetization precession, with its phase
depending on the direction of an external magnetic field. Our micromagnetic
simulations effectively describe the magnetization precession and switching in
terms of laser-induced changes in the crystal's magneto-elastic energy.

exploiting the correspondence between edge state physics and entanglement

of fermionic interactions into the discussion of topological insulators. We

Alternative computing paradigms open the door to exploiting recent
innovations in computational hardware. Dynamical computing is one such paradigm
that synthesizes momentum computing -- an extremely energy-efficient design
framework -- with nanoscale thermodynamic computing. This synthesis can be
implemented with Josephson junction technology, giving a testbed with tunable
coupling to a thermal environment. Investigating the dynamics and
thermodynamics of these superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs),
though, requires (i) constructing physically-realizable superconducting
circuits, (ii) thoroughly understanding circuit energetics, and (iii) designing
sufficiently complex circuits that support a suite of useful operations.
First-principle circuit design leads to prohibitive algebraic complications
that to-date precluded achieving these goals quickly and efficiently. We
circumvent these complications by (i) specializing our class of circuits and
operating regime, (ii) synthesizing existing methods to suit these
specializations, and (iii) implementing solution-finding optimizations that
facilitate physically interpreting circuit degrees of freedom and that respect
physically-grounded constraints. Practically, this leads to efficient circuit
prototyping and analysis and access to scalable circuit architectures. The
analytical efficiency is demonstrated by directly reproducing the thermodynamic
potential induced by the variable $\beta$ rf (v$\beta$-rf) SQUID. We then show
how inductively couple two v$\beta$-rf SQUIDs yielding a device capable of
performing 2-bit computations. The methods detailed here provide a basis to
construct universal logic gates and investigate their thermodynamic
performance.

We explored quinary body-centered cubic (bcc) high-entropy alloy (HEA)
superconductors with valence electron concentrations (VECs) ranging from 4.6 to
5.0, a domain that has received limited attention in prior research. Our search
has led to the discovery of new bcc Ti-Hf-Nb-Ta-Re superconducting alloys,
which exhibit an interesting phenomenon of phase segregation into two bcc
phases with slightly different chemical compositions, as the VEC increases. The
enthalpy of the formation of each binary compound explains the phase
segregation. All the alloys investigated were categorized as type-II
superconductors, with superconducting critical temperatures ($T_\mathrm{c}$)
ranging from 3.25 K to 4.38 K. We measured the Vickers microhardness, which
positively correlated with the Debye temperature, and compared it with the
hardness values of other bcc HEA superconductors. Our results indicate that
$T_\mathrm{c}$ systematically decreases with an increase in hardness beyond a
threshold of approximately 350 HV. Additionally, we plotted $T_\mathrm{c}$ vs.
VEC for representative quinary bcc HEAs. The plot revealed the asymmetric VEC
dependence. The correlation between the hardness and $T_\mathrm{c}$, as well as
the asymmetric dependence of $T_\mathrm{c}$ on VEC can be attributed to the
simultaneous effects of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level and
electron-phonon coupling under the uncertainty principle, especially in the
higher VEC region.

Wave function of a localized state created by a short-range impurity in two
dimensions falls off with distance, r, from the impurity as r^{-1/2}exp(-r/a),
where "a" is the localization radius. With randomly positioned identical
impurities with low concentration, n<<a^{-2}, the level smears into a band due
to the overlap of the impurity wave functions. This is the essence of the
Lifshitz model. We demonstrate that, upon incorporation of the spin-orbit
coupling, the impurity wave functions acquire oscillating factors which,
subsequently, modify their overlap. As a result of such modification, the
density of states develops singularities at certain energies.

Studying superconductivity in Dirac semimetals is an important step in
understanding quantum matter with topologically non-trivial order parameters.
We report on the properties of the superconducting phase in single crystals of
the Dirac material LaCuSb2 prepared by the self-flux method. We find that
chemical and hydrostatic pressure drastically suppress the superconducting
transition. Furthermore, due to large Fermi surface anisotropy, magnetization
and muon spin relaxation measurements reveal Type-II superconductivity for
applied magnetic fields along the $a$-axis, and Type-I superconductivity for
fields along the $c$-axis. Specific heat confirms the bulk nature of the
transition, and its deviation from single-gap $s$-wave BCS theory suggests
multigap superconductivity. Our tight-binding model points to an anisotropic
gap function arising from the spin-orbital texture near the Dirac nodes,
providing an explanation for the appearance of an anomaly in specific heat well
below $T_c$. Given the existence of superconductivity in a material harboring
Dirac fermions, LaCuSb2 proves an interesting material candidate in the search
for topological superconductivity.

Quantum kinetically constrained models can exhibit a wealth of dynamical
phenomena ranging from anomalous transport to Hilbert-space fragmentation
(HSF). We study a class of one-dimensional particle number conserving systems
where particle hoppings are subjected to an East-like constraint, akin to
facilitated spin models in classical glasses. While such a kinetic constraint
leads to HSF, we find that the degree of fragmentation exhibits a sharp
transition as the average particle density is varied. Below a critical density,
the system transitions from being weakly fragmented where most of the initial
states thermalize diffusively, to strongly fragmented where the dynamics are
frozen and the system fails to thermalize. Remarkably, the East model allows
for both efficient numerical simulations and analytic solutions of various
diagnostics of the phase transition, from which we obtain a set of exact
critical exponents. We find that the freezing transition in particle-conserving
East models belongs to the same universality class as dipole-conserving fracton
systems. Our results provide a tractable minimal model for filling-induced
freezing transitions associated with HSF, which can be readily tested in
state-of-the-art quantum platforms.

Soft clay-like Li-superionic conductors have been recently synthesized by
mixing rigid-salts. Through computational and experimental analysis, we clarify
how a soft clay-like material can be created from a mixture of rigid-salts.
Using molecular dynamics simulations with a deep learning-based interatomic
potential energy model, we uncover the microscopic features responsible for
soft clay-formation from ionic solid mixtures. We find that salt mixtures
capable of forming molecular solid units on anion exchange, along with the slow
kinetics of such reactions, are key to soft-clay formation. Molecular solid
units serve as sites for shear transformation zones, and their inherent
softness enables plasticity at low stress. Extended X-ray absorption fine
structure spectroscopy confirms the formation of molecular solid units. A
general strategy for creating soft clay-like materials from ionic solid
mixtures is formulated.

High-entropy ceramics (HECs) are solid solutions of inorganic compounds with

emerge from this new class of materials. Here, we report the discovery of
superconductivity around 2.35 K and topological properties in the
(Ti0.2Zr0.2Nb0.2Hf0.2Ta0.2)C high-entropy carbide ceramic (HECC), which has not
been observed before in any of the investigated HECC. Density functional theory
calculations showed that six type-II Dirac points exist in
(Ti0.2Zr0.2Nb0.2Hf0.2Ta0.2)C, which mainly contributed from the t2g orbitals of
transition metals and the p orbitals of C. Due to the stability of the
structure, we also observed robust superconductivity under pressure in this HEC
superconductor. This study expands the physical properties of HECs, which may
become a new material platform for superconductivity research, especially for
studying the coupling between superconductivity and topological physics.

Measurement is the foundation of science, and is a subtle concept especially
in quantum mechanics, where the action of detection interacts with the quantum
system perturbatively. The property of a quantum system is captured from the
stimulated evolution of either the system or the detecting reservoir. Transport
measurement, which applies an electric field and studies the migration of
charged particles, i.e. the current, is the most widely used technique. In
ultra-high mobility two-dimensional systems, transport measurement reveals
fruitful quantum phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect, the Aharonov-Bohm
oscillation and ballistic trajectory of quasiparticles, the microwave induced
zero resistance, the interference of quasiparticles, etc. The general
assumption that the quantum phase remains unchanged with a sufficiently small
probing current, unfortunately, is rarely examined experimentally. In this
work, we probe the ultra-high mobility two-dimensional electron system via its
interaction with a propagating surface acoustic wave and observe that the
system becomes more incompressible when hosting a current.

Crystals and glasses differ by the amplitude and the temperature dependence
of their thermal conductivity. However, there are crystals known to display
glass-like thermal conductivity. Here, we show that EuTiO$_3$, a quantum
paraelectric known to order antiferromagnetically at 5.5 K, is one such system.
The temperature dependence of resistivity and Seebeck coefficient yield an
insulating band gap of $\sim 0.22$ eV. Thermal conductivity is drastically
reduced. Its amplitude and temperature dependence are akin to what is seen in
amorphous silica. Comparison with non-magnetic perovskite solids, SrTiO$_3$,
KTaO$_3$, and EuCoO$_3$, shows that what impedes heat transport are $4f$ spins
at Eu$^{2+}$ sites, which couple to phonons well above the ordering
temperature. Thus, in this case, superexchange and valence fluctuations, not
magnetic frustration, are the drivers of the glass-like thermal conductivity.

Arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical microtraps with
micrometer-scale sizes have emerged as a fundamental, versatile, and powerful
platform for quantum sciences and technologies. This platform enables the
bottom-up engineering of quantum systems, offering the capability of
low-entropy preparation of quantum states with flexible geometry, as well as
manipulation and detection at the single-site level. The utilization of
ultracold itinerant atoms with tunnel coupling in optical microtraps provides
new opportunities for quantum simulation, enabling the exploration of exotic
quantum states, phases, and dynamics, which would otherwise be challenging to
achieve in conventional optical lattices due to high entropy and limited
geometric flexibility. Here the development of tunnel-coupled optical
microtraps for the manipulation of ultracold atomic quantum systems and its
recent advances are briefly reviewed.

Multi-level magnetic recording is a new concept for increasing the data
storage capacity of hard disk drives. However, its implementation has been
limited by a lack of suitable media capable of storing information at multiple
levels. Herein, we overcome this problem by developing dual FePt-C nanogranular
films separated by a Ru-C breaking layer with a cubic crystal structure. The
FePt grains in the bottom and top layers of the developed media exhibited
different effective magnetocrystalline anisotropies and Curie temperatures. The
former is realized by different degrees of ordering in the L10-FePt grains,
whereas the latter was attributed to the diffusion of Ru, thereby enabling
separate magnetic recordings at each layer under different magnetic fields and
temperatures. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements and heat-assisted magnetic
recording simulations showed that these media enabled 3-level recording and
could potentially be extended to 4-level recording, as the up-down and down-up
states exhibited non-zero magnetization.

Partial, frustrated synchronization and chimera states are expected to occur
in Kuramoto-like models if the spectral dimension of the underlying graph is
low: $d_s < 4$. We provide numerical evidence that this really happens in case
of the high-voltage power grid of Europe ($d_s < 2$) and in case of the
largest, exactly known brain network corresponding to the fruit-fly (FF)
connectome ($d_s < 4$), even though their graph dimensions are much higher,
i.e.: $d^{EU}_g\simeq 2.6(1)$ and $d^{FF}_g\simeq 5.4(1)$, $d^{KKI113}_g\simeq
3.4(1)$. We provide local synchronization results of the first- and
second-order (Shinomoto) Kuramoto models by numerical solutions on the the FF
and the European power-grid graphs, respectively and show the emergence of
chimera-like patterns on the graph community level as well as by the local
order parameters.

Rejuvenation and memory, long considered the distinguishing features of spin
glasses, have recently been proven to result from the growth of multiple length
scales. This insight, enabled by simulations on the Janus~II supercomputer, has
opened the door to a quantitative analysis. We combine numerical simulations
with comparable experiments to introduce two coefficients that quantify memory.
A third coefficient has been recently presented by Freedberg et al. We show
that these coefficients are physically equivalent by studying their temperature
and waiting-time dependence.

The quest for pragmatic room-temperature (RT) magnetic semiconductors (MSs)
with a suitable bandgap constitutes one of the contemporary opportunities to be
exploited. This may provide a materials platform for to bring new-generation
ideal information device technologies into real-world applications where the
otherwise conventionally separately utilized charge and spin are simultaneously
exploited. Here we present RT ferromagnetism in an Fe-doped SnSe (Fe:SnSe) van
der Waals (vdW) single crystalline ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) with a
semiconducting bandgap of ~1.19 eV (comparable to those of Si and GaAs). The
synthesized Fe:SnSe single crystals feature a dilute Fe content of less than
1.0 at%, a Curie temperature of ~310 K, a layered vdW structure identical to
that of pristine SnSe, and the absence of in-gap defect states. The Fe:SnSe vdW
diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) single crystals are grown using a simple
temperature-gradient melt-growth process, in which the magnetic Fe atom doping
is realized uniquely using FeI2 as the dopant precursor whose melting point is
low with respect to crystal growth, and which in principle possesses
industrially unlimited scalability. Our work adds a new member in the family of
long-searching RT magnetic semiconductors, and may establish a generalized
strategy for large-volume production of related DMSs.

<h3>Cylindrical void growth vs. grain fragmentation in FCC single crystals:  CPFEM study for two types of loading conditions</h3>

The crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) is used to investigate
the coupling between the cylindrical void growth or collapse and grain
refinement in face-centered cubic (FCC) single crystals. A 2D plane strain
model with one void is used. The effect of the initial lattice orientation,
similarities, and differences between stress- and strain-driven loading
scenarios are explored. To this end, boundary conditions are enforced in two
different ways. The first one is based on maintaining constant in-plane stress
biaxiality via a dedicated truss element, while the second one is imposing a
constant displacement biaxiality factor. Uniaxial and biaxial loading cases are
studied. For the uniaxial loading case a special configuration, which enforces
an equivalent pattern of plastic deformation in the pristine crystal, is
selected in order to investigate the mutual interactions between the evolving
void and the developed lattice rotation heterogeneity. Next, biaxial loading
cases are considered for three crystal orientations, one of which is not
symmetric with respect to loading directions. It is analysed how stress or
strain biaxility factors and initial lattice orientation influence the void
evolution in terms of its size and shape. Moreover, the consequences of
variations in the resulting heterogeneity of lattice rotation are studied in
the context of the grain refinement phenomenon accompanying the void evolution.
Scenarios that may lead to more advanced grain fragmentation are identified.

<h3>Effects of atom losses on a one-dimensional lattice gas of hardcore  bosons</h3>

<br>
<br>
Atom losses occur naturally during cold atoms experiments. Since this
phenomenon is unavoidable, it is important to understand its effect on the
remaining atoms. Here we study a gas of hard-core bosons on a lattice subject
to $K$-body losses (where $K=1,2,3,\dots$ is the number of atoms lost in each
loss event), and in particular we investigate the effect of losses on the
rapidity distribution $\rho(k)$ of the atoms. Under the assumption that losses
are weak enough so that the system relaxes between two loss events, we are able
to determine the loss functional $F[\rho](k)$ encoding the loss process for
$K$-body losses. We derive closed expressions for the cases of one- and
two-body losses, and show their effects on the evolution of the total number of
particles. Then we add a harmonic trapping potential and study the evolution of
the position-dependent rapidity distribution of this system by solving
numerically the evolution equation for one-, two- and three-body losses.

<h3>Equivariant graph neural network interatomic potential for Green-Kubo  thermal conductivity in phase change materials</h3>

Thermal conductivity is a fundamental material property that plays an
essential role in technology, but its accurate evaluation presents a challenge
for theory. In this letter, we demonstrate the application of E(3)-equivariant
neutral network interatomic potentials within Green-Kubo formalism to determine
the lattice thermal conductivity in amorphous and crystalline materials. We
apply this method to study the thermal conductivity of germanium telluride
(GeTe) as a prototypical phase change material. A single deep learning
interatomic potential is able to describe the phase transitions between the
amorphous, rhombohedral and cubic phases, with critical temperatures in good
agreement with experiments. Furthermore, this approach accurately captures the
pronounced anharmonicity present in GeTe, enabling precise calculations of
thermal conductivity. In contrast, the Boltzmann transport equation tends to
overestimate it by approximately a factor of two in the crystalline phases.

<h3>Necessary and sufficient symmetries in Event-Chain Monte Carlo with  generalized flows and Application to hard dimers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Event-Chain Monte Carlo methods generate continuous-time and non-reversible
Markov processes which often display important accelerations compared to their
reversible counterparts. However their generalization to any system may appear
less straightforward. In this work, we build on the recent analytical
characterization of such methods as generating Piecewise Deterministic Markov
Processes (PDMP) to clearly decipher the necessary symmetries the PDMP must
obey from the sufficient ones which may prove to be too restrictive in a
general setting. Thus, we derive a necessary rotational invariance of the
probability flows and the minimum event rate, which identifies with the
corresponding infinitesimal rejection rate. Such conditions always yield a
correct ECMC scheme. We then generalize such results to the case of more
general deterministic flows than the translational ones. In particular, we
define two classes of interest of general flows, the ideal and uniform-ideal
ones, which respectively suppresses or reduces the event rates. From there, we
implement a complete non-reversible sampling of a systems of hard dimers,
thanks to the introduction of rotational flows, which are uniform-ideal and
shows a speed-up of up to ~3 compared to the state-of-the-art ECMC/Metropolis
hybrid scheme.

methodology. Control experiments for the mechanistic elucidation (Raman
analysis) and chemical nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surfaces are also

<br>
<br>
Record efficiency in chalcopyrite-based solar cells Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 is
achieved using a gallium gradient to increase the band gap of the absorber
towards the back side. Although this structure has successfully reduced
recombination at the back contact, we demonstrate that in industrial absorbers
grown in the pilot line of Avancis, the back part is a source of non-radiative
recombination. Depth-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal two
main radiative recombination paths at 1.04 eV and 1.5-1.6 eV, attributed to two
phases of low and high band gap material, respectively. Instead of a continuous
change in the band gap throughout the thickness of the absorber, we propose a
model where discrete band gap phases interlace, creating an apparent gradient.
Cathodoluminescence and Raman scattering spectroscopy confirm this result.
Additionally, deep defects associated to the high gap phase reduce the absorber
performance. Etching away the back part of the absorber leads to an increase of
one order of magnitude in the PL intensity, i.e., 60 meV in quasi Fermi level
splitting. Non-radiative voltage losses correlate linearly with the relative
contribution of the high energy PL peak, suggesting that reducing the high gap
phase could increase the open circuit voltage by up to 180 mV.

We compute the perturbative expansion for the effective interaction $W$ of
the half-filled 2-dimensional Hubbard model. We derive extensions of standard
RPA resummations that include arbitrarily high order contributions in the
$W_{\uparrow\uparrow}$ and $W_{\uparrow\downarrow}$ basis. Using algorithmic
tools we explore the static $Q$-dependent interaction as well as the same-time
quantity both in momentum- and real-space. We emphasize the absence of
screening in the Hubbard interaction where we find an enhanced repulsive local
$W_{\uparrow\downarrow}$ with a non-zero attractive $W_{\uparrow\uparrow}$.
Finally, starting from only a locally repulsive bare interaction find an
emergent non-local nearest-neighbor attraction for low temperatures at
sufficiently large values of $U/t$ which may be key to understanding pairing
processes in the model.

The symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP) is a paradigmatic model of
diffusion in a single-file geometry, in which the particles cannot cross. In
this model, the study of currents have attracted a lot of attention. In
particular, the distribution of the integrated current through the origin, and
more recently, of the integrated current through a moving reference point, have
been obtained in the long time limit. This latter observable is particularly
interesting, as it allows to obtain the distribution of the position of a
tracer particle. However, up to now, these different observables have been
considered independently. Here, we characterise the joint statistical
properties of these currents, and their correlations with the density of
particles. We show that the correlations satisfy closed integral equations,
which generalise the ones obtained recently for a single observable. We also
obtain boundary conditions verified by these correlations, which take a simple
physical form for any single-file system. As a consequence of our results, we
quantify the correlations between the displacement of a tracer, and the
integrated current of particles through the origin.

The cost of information processing in physical systems calls for a trade-off
between performance and energetic expenditure. Here we formulate and study a
computation-dissipation bottleneck in mesoscopic systems used as input-output

non-equilibrium leads to enhanced performance. Our framework sheds light on a
crucial compromise between information compression, input-output computation
and dynamic irreversibility induced by non-reciprocal interactions.

Quantum systems with engineered Hamiltonians can be used as simulators of
many-body physics problems to provide insights beyond the capabilities of
classical computers. Semiconductor gate-defined quantum dot arrays have emerged
as a versatile platform for quantum simulation of generalized Fermi-Hubbard
physics, one of the richest playgrounds in condensed matter physics. In this
work, we employ a germanium 4$\times$2 quantum dot array and show that the
naturally occurring long-range Coulomb interaction can lead to exciton
formation and transport. We tune the quantum dot ladder into two
capacitively-coupled channels and exploit Coulomb drag to probe the binding of
electrons and holes. Specifically, we shuttle an electron through one leg of
the ladder and observe that a hole is dragged along in the second leg under the
right conditions. This corresponds to a transition from single-electron
transport in one leg to exciton transport along the ladder. Our work paves the
way for the study of excitonic states of matter in quantum dot arrays.

<h3>Geometric control of tilt transition dynamics in single-clamped  thermalized elastic sheets</h3>

<br>
<i>Roberto Abril Valenzuela, Paul Z. Hanakata, Mark J. Bowick</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the finite-temperature dynamics of thin elastic sheets in a
single-clamped cantilever configuration. This system is known to exhibit a tilt
transition at which the preferred mean plane of the sheet shifts from
horizontal to a plane above or below the horizontal. The resultant thermally
roughened two-state (up/down) system possesses rich dynamics on multiple time
scales. In the tilted regime, a finite energy barrier separates the
spontaneously chosen up state from the inversion-symmetric down state.
Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that over a sufficiently long time, such
thermalized elastic sheets transition between the two states, residing in each
for a finite dwell time. One might expect that temperature is the primary
driver for tilt inversion. We find, instead, that the primary control
parameter, at fixed tilt order parameter, is the dimensionless and purely
geometrical aspect ratio of the clamped width to the total length of the
otherwise-free sheet. Using a combination of an effective mean-field theory and
Kramers' theory, we derive the transition rate and examine its asymptotic
behavior. At length scales beyond a material-dependent thermal length scale,
renormalization of the elastic constants qualitatively modifies the temperature
response. In particular, the transition is suppressed by thermal fluctuations,
enhancing the robustness of the tilted state. We check and supplement these
findings with further molecular dynamics simulations for a range of aspect
ratios and temperatures.

The thermodynamic properties of the Boltzmann hard sphere system is
discussed. It was found that zero point energy decreases with temperature so
slowly that it turned out to be an almost a constant addition to the classical
value. In result the heat capacity of the system differs little from the
classical value of 1.5 k everywhere except for the narrow region of low
temperatures, where heat capacity drops to zero. The predicted linear
temperature contribution to the heat capacity like in ideal Fermi gas was
clearly detected in the quantum hard sphere system at the lowest temperatures.
