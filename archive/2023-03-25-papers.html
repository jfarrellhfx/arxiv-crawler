<h3>Boltzmann's H-Function Extended to Orientation: Anomalous Molecular  Shape Dependence of Relaxation and Time Scales of Entropy Relaxation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13082</a>

Boltzmann's H-function H(t) is often regarded as an analog of time-dependent
entropy. It provides valuable information about the time scale of relaxation of
a nonequilibrium distribution function. In this work, we generalize Boltzmann's
H-function (H(t)) to study the relaxation dynamics of a gas of molecules with
orientational degrees of freedom. We evaluate the time (t) evolution of joint
probability distribution f (p, L, t) for linear (p) and angular (L) momenta
from an initial nonequilibrium state by molecular dynamics simulations for
prolate and oblate-shaped particles. Our prolate and oblate molecules interact
with each other by two-body Gay-Berne potential. We calculate the relaxation of
the generalized H(t) with orientation from two specially prepared initial (t=0)
nonequilibrium states. In the long-time limit, the H function saturates to its
exact equilibrium value, which is the sum of translational and rotational
contributions. These, in turn, are related to respective kinetic entropies. We
find that both translational and rotational components of H(t) decay nearly
exponentially with time; the rotational component is more sensitive to the
aspect ratio. A remarkable rapid decrease in relaxation time is observed as the
spherical limit is approached, in a way tantalizingly reminiscent of
hydrodynamic predictions with slip boundary conditions. The latter is also
calculated analytically by solving the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation. We
introduce a physically motivated differential term to study the magnitude of
translation-rotation coupling. This function shows interesting dynamical
behavior at intermediate times. Overall, this study provides insights into the
relaxation dynamics of a gas of molecules with different shapes and
interactions and highlights the importance of considering both translational
and rotational contributions to the H-function.

<br>
Cells are fundamental building blocks of living organisms displaying an array
of shapes, morphologies, and textures that encode specific functions and
physical behaviors. Elucidating the rules of this code remains a challenge. In
this work, we create biomimetic structural building blocks by coating
ellipsoidal droplets of a smectic liquid crystal with a protein-based active
cytoskeletal gel, thus obtaining core-shell structures. By exploiting the
patterned texture and anisotropic shape of the smectic core, we were able to
mold the complex nematodynamics of the interfacial active material and identify
new time-dependent states where topological defects periodically oscillate
between rotational and translational regimes. Our nemato-hydrodynamic
simulations of active nematics demonstrate that, beyond topology and activity,
the dynamics of the active material are profoundly influenced by the local
curvature and smectic texture of the droplet, as well as by external
hydrodynamic forces.
These results illustrate how the incorporation of these constraints into
active nematic shells orchestrates remarkable spatio-temporal motifs, offering
critical new insights into biological processes and providing compelling
prospects for designing bio-inspired micro-machines.

<h3>Single-parameter variational wavefunctions for quantum Hall bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12825" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12825</a>

Bilayer quantum Hall states have been shown to be described by a BCS-paired
state of composite fermions. However, finding a qualitatively accurate model
state valid across all values of the bilayer separation is challenging. Here,
we introduce two variational wavefunctions, each with a single variational
parameter, which can be thought of as a proxy for the BCS order parameter.
Studying systems of up to 9+9 electrons in a spherical geometry using Monte
Carlo methods, we show that the ground state can be accurately described by
these single-parameter variational states. In addition, for the first time we
provide a numerically exact wavefunction for the Halperin-111 state in terms of
composite fermions.

<h3>Classification and emergence of quantum spin liquids in chiral Rydberg  models</h3>

We investigate the nature of quantum phases arising in chiral interacting
Hamiltonians recently realized in Rydberg atom arrays. We classify all possible
fermionic chiral spin liquids with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ global symmetry using parton
construction on the honeycomb lattice. The resulting classification includes
six distinct classes of gapped quantum spin liquids: the corresponding
variational wave functions obtained from two of these classes accurately
describe the Rydberg many-body ground state at $1/2$ and $1/4$ particle
density. Complementing this analysis with tensor network simulations, we
conclude that both particle filling sectors host a spin liquid with the same
topological order of a $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect. At density
$1/2$, our results clarify the phase diagram of the model, while at density
$1/4$, they provide an explicit construction of the ground state wave function
with almost unit overlap with the microscopic one. These findings pave the way
to the use of parton wave functions to guide the discovery of quantum spin
liquids in chiral Rydberg models.

<h3>Observation of non-Hermitian edge burst in quantum dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12831</a>

<br>
<br>
The non-Hermitian skin effect, by which the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are
predominantly localized at the boundary, has revealed a strong sensitivity of
non-Hermitian systems to the boundary condition. Here we experimentally observe
a striking boundary-induced dynamical phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian
edge burst, which is characterized by a sharp boundary accumulation of loss in
non-Hermitian time evolutions. In contrast to the eigenstate localization, the
edge burst represents a generic non-Hermitian dynamical phenomenon that occurs
in real time. Our experiment, based on photonic quantum walks, not only
confirms the prediction of the phenomenon, but also unveils its complete
space-time dynamics. Our observation of edge burst paves the way for studying
the rich real-time dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems.

<h3>Emergence of Chern Supermetal and Pair-Density Wave through Higher-Order  Van Hove Singularities in the Haldane-Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12833" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12833</a>

<br>
<br>
While advances in electronic band theory have brought to light new
topological systems, understanding the interplay of band topology and
electronic interactions remains a frontier question. In this work, we predict
new interacting electronic orders emerging near higher-order Van Hove
singularities present in the Chern bands of the Haldane model. We classify the
nature of such singularities and employ unbiased renormalization group methods
that unveil a complex landscape of electronic orders, which include
ferromagnetism, density-waves and superconductivity. Importantly, we show that
repulsive interactions can stabilize long-sought pair-density wave state and an
exotic Chern supermetal, which is a new class of non-Fermi liquid with
anomalous quantum Hall response. This framework opens a new path to explore
unconventional electronic phases in two-dimensional chiral bands through the
interplay of band topology and higher-order Van Hove singularities.

<h3>Photogalvanic response in multi-Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12836" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12836</a>
<br>
<i>Arpit Raj, Swati Chaudhary, Gregory A. Fiete</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the dependence of the photogalvanic response of a multi-Weyl
semimetal on its topological charge, tilt, and chemical potential. We derive
analytical expressions for the shift and injection conductivities for tilted
charge-$n$ Weyl points $(n=1,2,3)$ using a low energy two-band effective
Hamiltonian. For double-Weyl semimetals, we also compute the response from
two-band and four-band tight-binding models with broken time-reversal symmetry
to study the effect of band bending and the contributions from higher bands. We
find a significant deviation in the responses obtained from the effective
low-energy continuum model and more realistic four-band continuum and
tight-binding models. We analyze several different limits of these models. We
describe the nature of the deviations and provide estimates of their dependence
on the frequency and other model parameters. Our analysis provides a simple
explanation for the first-principle calculation based frequency dependence of
the injection current in SrSi$_2$. Additionally, we find interesting parameter
regimes where the frequency dependence of the non-linear optical response can
be directly used to probe the type-I/type-II nature of the Weyl cone. We obtain
analytical results for the charge-4 Weyl semimetal by reducing the original
problem involving a triple $k$-space integral to one with only a double
integral. This simplification allows us to extract all relevant information
about the nature of its second-order dc response and the precise condition for
observing circular photogalvanic effect quantization. The semi-analytical
approach presented here can also be extended to a systematic study of second
harmonic generation and first-order optical conductivity in charge-4 Weyl
semimetals.

<h3>Phonon and magnon jets above the critical current in nanowires with  planar domain walls</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12879</a>
<br>
<i>Maria Stamenova, Plamen Stamenov, Tchavdar Todorov</i>
<br>
<br>
We show through non-equilibrium non-adiabatic electron-spin-lattice
simulations that above a critical current in magnetic atomic wires with a
narrow domain wall the electron flow triggers violent stimulated emission of
phonons and magnons with an almost complete conversion of the incident electron
momentum flux into a phonon and magnon flux. The electronic current suffers a
heavy suppression above this threshold. This poses a fundamental limit to the
current densities attainable in atomic wires. At the same time it opens up an
exciting way of generating the alternative quasi-particle currents above once
the requisite electronic-structure properties are met.

<h3>Giant spin Hall effect in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin Hall effect (SHE), in which electrical current generates transverse
spin current, plays an important role in spintronics for the generation and
manipulation of spin-polarized electrons. The phenomenon originates from
spin-orbit coupling. In general, stronger spin-orbit coupling favors larger
SHEs but shorter spin relaxation times and diffusion lengths. To achieve both
large SHEs and long-range spin transport in a single material has remained a
challenge. Here we demonstrate a giant intrinsic SHE in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2
moir\'e bilayers by direct magneto optical imaging. Under moderate electrical
currents with density < 1 A/m, we observe spin accumulation on transverse
sample edges that nearly saturates the spin density. We also demonstrate
long-range spin Hall transport and efficient non-local spin accumulation
limited only by the device size (about 10 um). The gate dependence shows that
the giant SHE occurs only near the Chern insulating state, and at low
temperatures, it emerges after the quantum anomalous Hall breakdown. Our
results demonstrate moir\'e engineering of Berry curvature and large SHEs for
potential spintronics applications.

<h3>Theoretical studies of enhanced anomalous Nernst effect in Fe$_3$Ga</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12886</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is a member of the extensive family of
topological effects in solid state physics. It converts a heat current into
electric voltage and originates from the Berry curvature of electronic bands
near the Fermi level. Recent results established the Fe$_3$Ga alloy as one of
the most promising candidates for applications, due to its flat band structure
consisting of rich web of nodal lines. In this theoretical work, we study the
effect of deformation of Fe$_3$Ga on the anomalous Nernst effect, which
naturally occurs in thin films. Furthermore, we demonstrate that doping, which
effectively shifts the position of the Fermi level, can also significantly
modify the strength of the effect. Lastly, we provide detailed analysis of the
origin of ANE in the electronic structure of Fe$_3$Ga which yields a deeper
insight into the generating mechanisms, understanding of which can lead to
substantial enhancement of the effect in the future.

<h3>Detecting low-energy quasilocalized excitations in computer glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12887</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Soft, quasilocalized excitations (QLEs) are known to generically emerge in a
broad class of disordered solids, and to govern many facets of the physics of
glasses, from wave attenuation to plastic instabilities. In view of this key
role of QLEs, shedding light upon several open questions in glass physics
depends on the availability of computational tools that allow to study QLEs'
statistical mechanics. The latter is a formidable task since harmonic analyses
are typically contaminated by hybridizations of QLEs with phononic excitations
at low frequencies, obscuring a clear picture of QLEs' abundance, typical
frequencies and other important micromechanical properties. Here we present an
efficient algorithm to detect the field of quasilocalized excitations in
structural computer glasses. The algorithm introduced takes a computer-glass
sample as input, and outputs a library of QLEs embedded in that sample. We
demonstrate the power of the new algorithm by reporting the spectrum of glassy
excitations in two-dimensional computer glasses featuring a huge range of
mechanical stability, which is inaccessible using conventional harmonic
analyses due to phonon-hybridizations. Future applications are finally
discussed.

<h3>Hyperbolic polaritons in topological nodal ring semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
In mirror-symmetric systems, there is a possibility of the realization of
extended gapless electronic states characterized as nodal lines or rings.
Strain induced modifications to these states lead to emergence of different
classes of nodal rings with qualitatively different physical properties. Here
we study optical response and the electromagnetic wave propagation in type I
nodal ring semimetals, in which the low-energy quasiparticle dispersion is
parabolic in momentum $k_x$ and $k_y$ and is linear in $k_z$. This leads to a
highly anisotropic dielectric permittivity tensor in which the optical response
is plasmonic in one spatial direction and dielectric in the other two
directions. The resulting normal modes (polaritons) in the bulk material become
hyperbolic over a broad frequency range, which is furthermore tunable by the
doping level. The propagation, reflection, and polarization properties of the
hyperbolic polaritons not only provide valuable information about the
electronic structure of these fascinating materials in the most interesting
region near the nodal rings but also pave the way to tunable hyperbolic
materials with applications ranging from anomalous refraction and waveguiding
to perfect absorption in ultrathin subwavelength films.

<h3>Active Learning Sensitivity Analysis of $γ^\prime$(L1$_2$)  Precipitate Morphology of Ternary Co-Based Superalloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12924</a>
<br>
<i>Whitney Tso, Wenkun Wu, David N. Seidman, Olle G. Heinonen</i>
<br>
<br>
To better understand the equilibrium $\gamma^\prime$(L1$_2$) precipitate
morphology in Co-based superalloys, a phase field modeling sensitivity analysis
is conducted to examine how four phase-field parameters [initial Co
concentration ($c_0$), double-well barrier height ($\omega$), gradient energy
density coefficient ($\kappa$), and lattice misfit strain ($\epsilon_{\rm
misfit}$)] influence the $\gamma^\prime$(L1$_2$) precipitate size and
morphology. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models are used to fit the sample
points and to generate surrogate models for both precipitate size and
morphology. In an Active Learning approach, a Bayesian Optimization algorithm
is coupled with the GPR models to suggest new sample points to calculate and
efficiently update the models based on a reduction of uncertainty. The
algorithm has a user-defined objective, which controls the balance between
exploration and exploitation for new suggested points. Our methodology provides
a qualitative and quantitative relationship between the $\gamma^\prime$(L1$_2$)
precipitate size and morphology and the four phase-field parameters, and
concludes that the most sensitive phase-field parameter for precipitate size
and morphology is the initial Co concentration ($c_0$) and the double-well
barrier height ($\omega$), respectively. We note that the GPR model for
precipitate morphology required adding a noise tolerance in order to avoid
overfitting due to irregularities in some of the simulated equilibrium
$\gamma^\prime$(L1$_2$) precipitate morphology.

<h3>Polymer Informatics Beyond Homopolymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12938" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12938</a>

Polymers are diverse and versatile materials that have met a wide range of
material application demands. They come in several flavors and architectures,
e.g., homopolymers, copolymers, polymer blends, and polymers with additives.
Searching this enormous space for suitable materials with a specific set of
property/performance targets is thus non-trivial, painstaking, and expensive.
Such a search process can be made effective by the creation of rapid and
accurate property predictors. In this work, we present a machine-learning
framework to predict the thermal properties of homopolymers, copolymers, and
polymer blends. A universal fingerprinting scheme capable of handling this
entire polymer chemical class has been developed and a multi-task deep learning
algorithm is trained simultaneously on a large dataset of glass transition,
melting, and degradation temperatures. The developed models are accurate, fast,
flexible, and scalable to other properties when suitable data become available.

<h3>Temperature dependence of 7Li NMR relaxation rates in Li3InCl6, Li3YCl6,  Li1.48Al0.48Ge1.52(PO4)3 and LiPS5Cl</h3>

<br>
Inorganic solid-state battery electrolytes show high ionic conductivities and
enable the fabrication of all solid-state batteries. In this work, we present
the temperature dependence of spin-lattice relaxation time (T1), spin-spin
relaxation time (T2), and resonance linewidth of the 7Li nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) for four solid-state battery electrolytes (Li3InCl6 (LIC),
Li3YCl6 (LYC), Li1.48Al0.48Ge1.52(PO4)3 (LAGP) and LiPS5Cl (LPSC)) from 173 K
to 403 K at a 7Li resonance frequency of 233 MHz, and from 253 K to 353 K at a
7Li resonance frequency of 291 MHz. Additionally, we measured the spin-lattice
relaxation rates at an effective 7Li resonance frequency of 133 kHz using a
spin-locking pulse sequence in the temperature range of 253 K to 353 K. In
LPSC, the 7Li NMR relaxation is consistent with the Bloembergen-Pound-Purcell
(BPP) theory of NMR relaxation of dipolar nuclei. In LIC, LYC and LAGP, the BPP
theory does not describe the NMR relaxation rates for the temperature range and
frequencies of our measurements. The presented NMR relaxation data assists in
providing a complete picture of Li diffusion in the four solid-state battery
electrolytes.

<h3>Thermodynamic evidence for electron correlation-driven flattening of the  quasiparticle bands in the high-Tc cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12956" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12956</a>
<br>
<i>Neil Harrison, Mun K. Chan</i>
<br>
<br>
A flattened electronic band is one of several possible routes for increasing
the strength of the pairing interactions in a superconductor. With this in
mind, we show here that thermodynamic measurements of the high-Tc cuprates
reveal an appreciably stronger electron correlation-driven flattening of the
quasiparticle bands than has previously been indicated. Specifically, we find
that thermodynamic measurements indicate an electronic entropy in excess of
that that can be accounted for by the value of the universal Fermi velocity
inferred from photoemission experiments. The observed band flattening implies
that the Van Hove singularity features prominently in calorimetry measurements,
causing it undermine prior arguments for a divergence in the renormalization of
the effective mass near a critical doping $p^\ast$ based on calorimetry
measurements. The band flattening is also sufficient to drive the cuprates into
a strong pairing regime where the maximum transition temperature becomes
constrained by phase fluctuations.

<h3>Electronic-mediated nuclear stopping power in proton irradiated water  ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12975</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Muñoz-Santiburcio, Jorge Kohanoff, Emilio Artacho</i>
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, it has been assumed that the stopping of a swift ion
travelling through matter can be understood in terms of two essentially
independent components, i.e. electronic vs. nuclear. Performing extensive
Ehrenfest MD simulations of the process of proton irradiation of water ice that
accurately describe not only the non-adiabatic dynamics of the electrons but
also of the nuclei, we have found a stopping mechanism involving the interplay
of the electronic and nuclear subsystems. This effect, which consists in a
kinetic energy transfer from the projectile to the target nuclei thanks to the
perturbations of the electronic density caused by the irradiation, is
fundamentally different from the atomic displacements and collision cascades
characteristic of nuclear stopping. Moreover, it shows a marked isotopic effect
depending on the composition of the target, being relevant mostly for light
water as opposed to heavy water. This result is consistent with long-standing
experimental results which remained unexplained so far.

<h3>Anharmonic theory of superconductivity and its applications to emerging  quantum materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12977</a>
<br>
<i>Chandan Setty, Matteo Baggioli, Alessio Zaccone</i>
<br>
<br>
The role of anharmonicity on superconductivity has often been disregarded in
the past. Recently, it has been recognized that anharmonic decoherence could
play a fundamental role in determining the superconducting properties
(electron-phonon coupling, critical temperature, etc) of a large class of
materials, including systems close to structural soft-mode instabilities,
amorphous solids and metals under extreme high-pressure conditions. Here, we
review recent theoretical progress on the role of anharmonic effects, and in
particular certain universal properties of anharmonic damping, on
superconductivity. Our focus regards the combination of microscopic-agnostic
effective theories for bosonic mediators with the well-established BCS theory
and Migdal-Eliashberg theory for superconductivity. We discuss in detail the
theoretical frameworks, their possible implementation within first-principles
methods, and the experimental probes for anharmonic decoherence. Finally, we
present several concrete applications to emerging quantum materials, including
hydrides, ferroelectrics and systems with charge density wave instabilities.

<h3>Shear banding in monodisperse polymer melt</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12978" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12978</a>
<br>
<i>Fan Peng, Renkuan Cao, Cui Nie, Tingyu Xu, Liangbin Li</i>
<br>
<br>
We performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations on monodisperse
polymer melts to investigate the formation of shear banding. Under high shear
rates, shear banding occurs, which is accompanied by the entanglement
heterogeneity intimately. Interestingly, the same linear relationship between
the end-to-end distance $R_{ee}$ and entanglement density $Z$ is observed at
homogeneous flow before the onset of shear banding and at stable shear banding
state, where $R_{ee} \sim [ln(W_i^2)- \xi_0]Z$ is proposed as the criterion to
describe the dynamic force balance of molecular chain in flow with a high rate.
We establish a scaling relation between the disentanglement rate $V_d$ and
Weissenberg number $W_i$ as $V_d \sim W_i^2$ for stable flow. Deviating from
this relation leads to force imbalance and results in the emergence of shear
banding. The formation of shear banding prevents chain from further stretching
and untangling. The transition from homogeneous shear to shear banding
partially dissipates the increased free energy from shear and reduces the free
energy of the system.

<h3>Self-sustained deformable rotating liquid He cylinders: The pure normal  fluid $^3$He and superfluid $^4$He cases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12986</a>
<br>
<i>Martí Pi, Francesco Ancilotto, Manuel Barranco, Samuel L. Butler, José María Escartín</i>
<br>
<br>
We have studied self-sustained, deformable, rotating liquid He cylinders of
infinite length. In the normal fluid $^3$He case, we have employed a classical
model where only surface tension and centrifugal forces are taken into account,
as well as the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach in conjunction with a
semi-classical Thomas-Fermi approximation for the kinetic energy. In both
approaches, if the angular velocity is sufficiently large, it is energetically
favorable for the $^3$He cylinder to undergo a shape transition, acquiring an
elliptic-like cross section which eventually becomes two-lobed. In the $^4$He
case, we have employed a DFT approach that takes into account its superfluid
character, limiting the description to vortex-free configurations where angular
momentum is exclusively stored in capillary waves on a deformed cross section
cylinder. The calculations allow us to carry out a comparison between the
rotational behavior of a normal, rotational fluid ($^3$He) and a superfluid,
irrotational fluid ($^4$He).

Severe plastic deformations under high pressure are used to produce
nanostructured materials but were studied ex-situ. We introduce rough diamond
anvils to reach maximum friction equal to yield strength in shear and perform
the first in-situ study of the evolution of the pressure-dependent yield
strength and nanostructural parameters for severely pre-deformed Zr.
{\omega}-Zr behaves like perfectly plastic, isotropic, and
strain-path-independent. This is related to reaching steady values of the
crystallite size and dislocation density, which are pressure-, strain- and
strain-path-independent. However, steady states for {\alpha}-Zr obtained with
smooth and rough anvils are different, which causes major challenge in
plasticity theory.

Neutron reflectometry (NR) has emerged as a unique technique for the
investigation of structure and magnetism of thin films of both biologically
relevant and magnetic materials. The advantage of NR with respect to many other
surface-sensitive techniques is its sub-nanometer resolution that enables
structural characterizations at the molecular level. While in the case of
bio-relevant samples, NR can be used to probe thin films at buried interfaces,
non-destructively, even adopting a complex sample environment. Whereas the
polarized version of NR is best suited for revealing the interface magnetism
with a sub-nanometer depth resolution. In this article, I will briefly describe
the basic principle of NR with some applications of NR to both bio-relevant
samples and magnetic heterostructures.

We derive a variational expression for the correlation time of physical
observables in steady-state diffusive systems. As a consequence of this
variational expression, we obtain lower bounds on the correlation time, which
provide speed limits on the self-averaging of observables. In equilibrium, the
bound takes the form of a tradeoff relation between the long- and short-time
fluctuations of an observable. Out of equilibrium, the tradeoff can be
violated, leading to an acceleration of self-averaging. We relate this
violation to the steady-state entropy production rate, as well as the geometric
structure of the irreversible currents, giving rise to two complementary speed
limits. One of these can be formulated as a lower estimate on the entropy
production from the measurement of time-symmetric observables. Using an
illustrating example, we show the intricate behavior of the correlation time
out of equilibrium for different classes of observables and how this can be
used to partially infer dissipation even if no time-reversal symmetry breaking
can be observed in the trajectories of the observable.

Stacking and twisting atom-thin sheets create superlattice structures with
unique emergent properties, while tailored light fields can manipulate coherent
electron transport on ultrafast timescales. The unification of these two
approaches may lead to ultrafast creation and manipulation of band structure
properties, which is a crucial objective for the advancement of quantum
technology. Here, we address this by demonstrating a tailored lightwave-driven
analogue to twisted layer stacking. This results in sub-femtosecond control of
time-reversal symmetry breaking and thereby band structure engineering in a
hexagonal boron nitride monolayer. The results practically demonstrate the
realization of the topological Haldane model in an insulator. Twisting the
lightwave relative to the lattice orientation enables switching between band
configurations, providing unprecedented control over the magnitude and location
of the band gap, and curvature. A resultant asymmetric population at
complementary quantum valleys lead to a measurable valley Hall current,
detected via optical harmonic polarimetry. The universality and robustness of
the demonstrated sub-femtosecond control opens a new way to band structure
engineering on the fly paving a way towards large-scale ultrafast quantum
devices for real-world applications.

Quantum dots are frequently used as charge sensitive devices in low
temperature experiments to probe electric charge in mesoscopic conductors where
the current running through the quantum dot is modulated by the nearby charge
environment. Recent experiments have been operating these detectors using
reflectometry measurements up to GHz frequencies rather than probing the low
frequency current through the dot. In this work, we use an on-chip coplanar
waveguide resonator to measure the source-drain transport response of two
quantum dots at a frequency of 6 GHz, further increasing the bandwidth limit
for charge detection. Similar to the low frequency domain, the response is here
predominantly dissipative. For large tunnel coupling, the response is still
governed by the low frequency conductance, in line with Landauer-B\"uttiker
theory. For smaller couplings, our devices showcase two regimes where the high
frequency response deviates from the low frequency limit and
Landauer-B\"uttiker theory: When the photon energy exceeds the quantum dot
resonance linewidth, degeneracy dependent plateaus emerge. These are reproduced
by sequential tunneling calculations. In the other case with large asymmetry in
the tunnel couplings, the high frequency response is two orders of magnitude
larger than the low frequency conductance G, favoring the high frequency
readout.

Non-reciprocal electronic transport in a spatially homogeneous system arises
from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries.
Superconducting and Josephson diodes, a key ingredient for future
non-dissipative quantum devices, have recently been realized. Only a few
examples of a vertical superconducting diode effect have been reported and its
mechanism, especially whether intrinsic or extrinsic, remains elusive. Here we
demonstrate a substantial supercurrent non-reciprocity in a van der Waals
vertical Josephson junction formed with a Td-WTe2 barrier and NbSe2 electrodes
that clearly reflects the intrinsic crystal structure of Td-WTe2. The Josephson
diode efficiency increases with the Td-WTe2 thickness up to critical thickness,
and all junctions, irrespective of the barrier thickness, reveal magneto-chiral
characteristics with respect to a mirror plane of Td-WTe2. Our results,
together with the twist-angle-tuned magneto-chirality of a Td-WTe2
double-barrier junction, show that two-dimensional materials promise vertical
Josephson diodes with high efficiency and tunability.

Establishing the fundamental relation between the homotopy invariants and the
band topology of Hamiltonians has played a critical role in the recent
development of topological phase research. In this work, we establish the
homotopy invariant and the related band topology of three-dimensional (3D)
real-valued Hamiltonians with two occupied and two unoccupied bands. Such a
real Hamiltonian generally appears in $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric spinless fermion
systems where $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ indicate the inversion and
time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We show that the 3D band topology of
the system is characterized by two independent Hopf invariants when the
lower-dimensional band topology is trivial. Thus, the corresponding 3D band
insulator with nonzero Hopf invariants can be called a real Hopf insulator
(RHI). In sharp contrast to all the other topological insulators discovered up
to now, the topological invariants of RHI can be defined only when both the
occupied and unoccupied states are simultaneously considered. Thus, the RHI
belongs to the category of delicate topological insulators proposed recently.
We show that finite-size systems with slab geometry support surface states with
nonzero Chern numbers in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric manner, and establish the
bulk-boundary correspondence. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence
of rotation symmetric RHIs using the returning Thouless pump.

Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are among the most important ingredients in food,
cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Many physical properties of such
products, incl. morphology, texture and rheology, are determined by the phase
behaviour of the included TAGs. Triglycerides are also of special interest for
the production of solid lipid nanoparticles, applied for controlled drug
delivery and for encapsulation of bioactive ingredients. In this paper, we
study the polymorphic behaviour of complex TAG mixtures, composed of 2 to 6
mixed TAGs, by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering
techniques, aiming to reveal the general rules for their phase behaviour upon
cooling and heating. The results show that two or more coexisting phases form
upon solidification $(\alpha$, $\beta'$ and/or $\beta)$, the number of which
depends strongly on the cooling rate and on the number of components in the
mixture. No completely miscible $\alpha$- or $\beta'$-phases were observed. The
structure of the most stable $\beta$ polymorphs, formed upon subsequent heating
of the solidified samples, does not depend on the thermal history of the
samples. For all mixtures studied, we observed one-component $\beta$ domains,
coexisting with binary mixed $\beta$ domains with composition and structure
which do not depend on the specific TAG ratio in the mixture. In other words,
for a mixture with $k$ saturated TAGs we observed $(2k-1)$ different $\beta$
phases. These conclusions provide some predictive power when analysing the
phase transition properties of TAG mixtures.

Magnetic impurities on superconductors lead to bound states within the
superconducting gap, so called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. They are parity
protected, which enhances their lifetime, but makes it more difficult to excite
them. Here, we realize the excitation of YSR states by microwaves facilitated
by the tunnel coupling to another superconducting electrode in a scanning
tunneling microscope (STM). We identify the excitation process through a family
of anomalous microwave-assisted tunneling peaks originating from a second-order
resonant Andreev process, in which the microwave excites the YSR state
triggering a tunneling event transferring a total of two charges. We vary the
amplitude and the frequency of the microwave to identify the energy threshold
and the evolution of this excitation process. Our work sets an experimental
basis and proof-of-principle for the manipulation of YSR states using
microwaves with an outlook towards YSR qubits.

Radiation tolerance is determined as an ability of crystalline materials to
withstand the accumulation of the radiation induced disorder. Based on the
magnitudes of such disorder levels, semiconductors are commonly grouped into
the low- or high-radiation tolerant. Nevertheless, upon exposing to
sufficiently high fluences, in all cases known by far, it ends up with either
extremely high disorder levels or amorphization. Here we show that gamma/beta
double polymorph Ga2O3 structures exhibit unprecedently high radiation
tolerance. Specifically, for room temperature experiments, they tolerate a
disorder equivalent to hundreds of displacements per atom, without severe
degradations of crystallinity; in comparison with, e.g., Si amorphizable
already with the lattice atoms displaced just once. We explain this behavior by
an interesting combination of the Ga- and O-sublattice properties in
gamma-Ga2O3. In particular, O-sublattice exhibits a strong recrystallization
trend to recover the face-centered-cubic stacking despite high mobility of O
atoms in collision cascades compared to Ga. Concurrently, the characteristic
structure of the Ga-sublattice is nearly insensitive to the accumulated
disorder. Jointly it explains macroscopically negligible structural
deformations in gamma-Ga2O3 observed in experiment. Notably, we also explained
the origin of the beta-to-gamma Ga2O3 transformation, as a function of
increased disorder in beta-Ga2O3 and studied the phenomena as a function of the
chemical nature of the implanted atoms. As a result, we conclude that
gamma-beta double polymorph Ga2O3 structures, in terms of their radiation
tolerance properties, benchmark a new class of universal radiation tolerant
semiconductors.

<h3>Thermodynamic bound on the asymmetry of cross-correlations</h3>

The principle of microscopic reversibility says that in equilibrium, two-time
cross-correlations are symmetric under the exchange of observables. Thus, the
asymmetry of cross-correlations is a fundamental, measurable, and often-used
statistical signature of deviation from equilibrium. We find a simple and
universal inequality between the magnitude of asymmetry and the cycle affinity,
i.e., the strength of thermodynamic driving. Our result applies to a large
class of systems and all state observables, and it suggests a fundamental
thermodynamic cost for various nonequilibrium functions quantified by the
asymmetry. It also provides a powerful tool to infer affinity from measured
cross-correlations, in a different and complementary way to the thermodynamic
uncertainty relations. As an application, we prove a thermodynamic bound on the
coherence of noisy oscillations, which was previously conjectured by Barato and
Seifert [Phys. Rev. E 95, 062409 (2017)]. We also derive a thermodynamic bound
on directed information flow in a biochemical signal transduction model.

<br>
<br>
Non-Gaussian diffusion was recently observed in a gas mixture with mass and
fraction contrast [F. Nakai et al, Phys. Rev. E 107, 014605 (2023)]. The mean
square displacement of a minor gas particle with a small mass is linear in
time, while the displacement distribution deviates from the Gaussian
distribution, which is called the Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. In this
work, we theoretically analyze this case where the mass contrast is
sufficiently large. Major heavy particles can be interpreted as immobile
obstacles, and a minor light particle behaves like a Lorentz gas particle
within an intermediate time scale. Despite the similarity between the gas
mixture and the conventional Lorentz gas system, the Lorentz gas description
cannot fully describe the Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. A successful
description can be achieved through an ensemble average of the statistical
quantities of the Lorentz gas over the initial speed.

<br>

We develop a topological classification of non-Hermitian effective
Hamiltonians that depend on momentum and frequency. Such effective Hamiltonians
are in one-to-one correspondence to single-particle Green's functions of
systems that satisfy translational invariance in space and time but may be
interacting or open. We employ K-theory, which for the special case of
noninteracting systems leads to the well-known tenfold-way topological
classification of insulators and fully gapped superconductors. Relevant
theorems for K-groups are reformulated and proven in the more transparent
language of Hamiltonians instead of vector bundles. We obtain 54 symmetry
classes for frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians satisfying
anti-unitary symmetries. Employing dimensional reduction, the group structure
for all these classes is calculated. This classification leads to a group
structure with one component from the momentum dependence, which corresponds to
the non-Hermitian generalization of topological insulators and superconductors,
and two additional parts resulting from the frequency dependence. These parts
describe winding of the effective Hamiltonian in the frequency direction and in
combined momentum-frequency space.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the stability of meson excitations (particle-antiparticle
bound states) in quantum many-body scars of a 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge
theory coupled to spinless fermions. By introducing a string representation of
the physical Hilbert space, we express a scar state $ |{\Psi_{n,l}}\rangle$ as
a superposition of all string bases with an identical string number $n$ and a
total length $l$. The string correlation function of lattice fermions hosts an
exponential decay as the distance increases for the small-$l$ scar state
$|{\Psi_{n,l}}\rangle$, indicating the existence of stable mesons. However, for
large $l$, the correlation function exhibits a power-law decay, signaling the
emergence of a meson instability. Furthermore, we show that this
mesonic-nonmesonic crossover can be detected by the quench dynamics, starting
from two low-entangled initial states, respectively, which are experimentally
feasible in quantum simulators. Our results expand the physics of quantum
many-body scars in lattice gauge theories, and reveal that the nonmesonic state
can also manifest ergodicity breaking.

<br>
<br>
There is compelling evidence that charge carriers in organic semiconductors
(OSs) self-localize in nano-scale space because of dynamic disorder. Yet, some
OSs, in particular recently emerged high-mobility organic molecular crystals,
feature reduced mobility at increasing temperature, a hallmark for delocalized
band transport. Here we present the temperature-dependent mobility in two
record-mobility OSs: DNTT (dinaphtho[2,3-b:2',3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene),
and its alkylated derivative, C8-DNTT-C8. By combining terahertz
photoconductivity measurements with fully atomistic non-adiabatic molecular
dynamics simulations, we show that while both crystals display a power-law
decrease of the mobility (\mu) with temperature (T, following: \mu \propto
T^(-n)), the exponent n differs substantially. Modelling provides n values in
good agreement with experiments and reveals that the differences in the falloff
parameter between the two chemically closely related semiconductors can be
traced to the delocalization of the different states thermally accessible by
charge carriers, which in turn depends on the specific electronic band
structure of the two systems. The emerging picture is that of holes surfing on
a dynamic manifold of vibrationally-dressed extended states with a
temperature-dependent mobility that provides a sensitive fingerprint for the
underlying density of states.

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures are an attractive platform for
studying exchange bias due to their defect free and atomically flat interfaces.
Chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4), an antiferromagnet, has uncompensated magnetic
spins in a single layer that make it an excellent candidate for studying
exchange bias. In this study, we examined the exchange bias in CrPS4/Fe3GeTe2
van der Waals heterostructures using anomalous Hall measurements. Our results
show that the exchange bias strength is robust for clean interfaces, with a
hysteresis loop shift of about 55 mT at 5 K for few-layer Fe3GeTe2, which is
larger than that obtained in most van der Waals AFM/FM heterostructures.
However, when exposed to air, the ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 layer develops a thin
surface oxide layer that significantly modulates the exchange bias. Remarkably,
this surface oxide layer can induce exchange bias without any field-cooling,
but merely by applying a 'preset field' from 5 K up to 140K due to the presence
of ferrimagnetic magnetite. We also observed exchange bias beyond the N\'eel
temperature of CrPS4, with two local minima due to contributions from CrPS4 and
surface oxides. These results illustrate the complex behaviour of exchange bias
in van der Waals heterostructures and its potential for tailored control.

The generation of ultrashort light pulses is essential for the advancement of
attosecond science. Here, we show that attosecond pulses approaching the
Fourier limit can be generated through optimized optical driving of tunneling
particles in solids. We propose an ansatz for the wave function of tunneling
electron-hole pairs based on a rigorous expression for massive Dirac fermions,
which enables efficient optimization of the waveform of the driving field. It
is revealed that the dynamic sign change in the effective mass due to optical
driving is crucial for shortening the pulse duration, which highlights a
distinctive property of Bloch electrons that is not present in atomic gases,
i.e., the periodic nature of crystals. These results show the potential of
utilizing solid materials as a source of attosecond pulses.

The sawtooth lattice shares some structural similarities with the kagome
lattice and may attract renewed research interest. Here, we report a
comprehensive study on the physical properties of Fe$_2$SiSe$_4$, an unexplored
member in the olivine chalcogenides with the sawtooth lattice of Fe. Our
results show that Fe$_2$SiSe$_4$ is a magnetic semiconductor with band gap of
0.66~eV. It first undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_{m1}$=110~K,
then an ferrimagnetic-like one at T$_{m2}$=50~K and finally a magnetic
transition at T$_{m3}$=25~K which is likely driven by the thermal populations
of spin-orbit manifold on the Fe site. Neutron diffraction analysis reveals a
non-collinear antiferromagnetic structure with propagation vector
$\mathbf{q_1}$=(0,0,0) at T$_{m2}$<T<T$_{m1}$. Interestingly, below T$_{m2}$,
an additional antiferromagnetic structure with $\mathbf{q_2}$=(0,0.5,0) appears
and Fe$_2$SiSe$_4$ exhibits a complex double-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic structure
which has never been observed in sawtooth olivines. Density functional theory
calculations suggest this complex noncollinear magnetic structure may originate
from the competing antiferromagnetic interactions for both intra- and
inter-chain in the sawtooth lattice. Furthermore, band structural calculations
show that Fe$_2$SiSe$_4$ has quasi-flat band features near the valence and
conduction bands. Based on the above results, we propose Fe$_2$SiSe$_4$ as a
new material platform to condensed matter researches.

We propose a novel device concept using spin-orbit-torques to realize a
magnetic field sensor, where we eliminate the sensor offset using a
differential measurement concept. We derive a simple analytical formulation for
the sensor signal and demonstrate its validity with numerical investigations
using macrospin simulations. The sensitivity and the measurable linear sensing
range in the proposed concept can be tuned by either varying the effective
magnetic anisotropy or by varying the magnitude of the injected currents. We
show that undesired perturbation fields normal to the sensitive direction
preserve the zero-offset property and only slightly modulate the sensitivity of
the proposed sensor. Higher-harmonics voltage analysis on a Hall cross
experimentally confirms the linearity and tunability via current strength.
Additionally, the sensor exhibits a non-vanishing offset in the experiment
which we attribute to the anomalous Nernst effect.

An actively managed portfolio almost never beats the market in the long term.
Thus, many investors often resort to passively managed portfolios whose aim is
to follow a certain financial index. The task of building such passive
portfolios aiming also to minimize the transaction costs is called Index
Tracking (IT), where the goal is to track the index by holding only a small
subset of assets in the index. As such, it is an NP-hard problem and becomes
unfeasible to solve exactly for indices with more than 100 assets. In this
work, we present a novel hybrid simulated annealing method that can efficiently
solve the IT problem for large indices and is flexible enough to adapt to
financially relevant constraints. By tracking the S&P-500 index between the
years 2011 and 2018 we show that our algorithm is capable of finding optimal
solutions in the in-sample period of past returns and can be tuned to provide
optimal returns in the out-of-sample period of future returns. Finally, we
focus on the task of holding an IT portfolio during one year and rebalancing
the portfolio every month. Here, our hybrid simulated annealing algorithm is
capable of producing financially optimal portfolios already for small subsets
of assets and using reasonable computational resources, making it an
appropriate tool for financial managers.

Liquid crystal elastomer films that morph into cones are strikingly capable
lifters. Thus motivated, we combine theory, numerics, and experiments to
reexamine the load-bearing capacity of conical shells. We show that a cone
squashed between frictionless surfaces buckles at a smaller load, even in
scaling, than the classical Seide/Koiter result. Such buckling begins in a
region of greatly amplified azimuthal compression generated in an outer
boundary layer with oscillatory bend. Experimentally and numerically, buckling
then grows sub-critically over the full cone. We derive a new thin-limit
formula for the critical load, $\propto t^{5/2}$, and validate it numerically.
We also investigate deep post-buckling, finding further instabilities producing
intricate states with multiple Pogorelov-type curved ridges arranged in
concentric-circles or Archimedean spirals. Finally, we investigate the forces
exerted by such states, which limit lifting performance in active cones.

<br>
We study current-induced switching of the N\'eel vector in CoO/Pt bilayers to
understand the underlaying antiferromagnetic switching mechanism. Surprisingly,
we find that for ultra-thin CoO/Pt bilayers electrical pulses along the same
path can lead to an increase or decrease of the spin Hall magnetoresistance
signal, depending on the current density of the pulse. By comparing the results
of these electrical measurements to XMLD-PEEM imaging of the antiferromagnetic
domain structure before and after the application of current pulses, we reveal
the reorientation of the N\'eel vector in ultra-thin CoO(4 nm). This allows us
to determine that even opposite resistance changes can result from a
thermomagnetoelastic switching mechanism. Importantly, our spatially resolved
imaging shows that regions where the current pulses are applied and regions
further away exhibit different switched spin structures, which can be explained
by a spin-orbit torque based switching mechanism that can dominate in very thin
films.

Barium ruthenate Ba$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$, in which Ru$_{3}$O$_{12}$ trimers
are connected together to form a chequered two-dimensional framework, has been
synthesised and its structural, magnetic and transport properties studied
between 300 K and 2 K. The paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N
\sim 105$ K evidenced on the susceptibility curve coincides with an increase of
electron localization in transport measurements. Thermoelectric power and Hall
coefficient measurements both exhibit dramatic changes at $T_N$, characteristic
of a reconstruction of the bands structure near the Fermi level. No pronounced
structural changes are observed at TN in this compound. The magnetic scattering
signal on the neutron powder diffraction patterns below $T_N$ is weak, but can
be tentatively modelled with an antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins at both
ends of a trimer, the spin of the more symmetric Ru site remaining idle.
Crystal field and strong spin-orbit coupling at the Ru$^{4+}$ site seem to be
the key parameters to understand the magnetic state of
Ba$_{4}$Ru$_{3}$O$_{10}$.

Shandite with Ni$_{3}$Pb$_{2}$S$_{2}$ chemical formula and R$\bar{3}$m
symmetry, contains the kagome sublattice formed by the transition metal atoms.
Recent experimental results confirmed the possibility of successfully
synthesizing Pd$_{3}$Pb$_{2}Ch_{2}$ ($Ch$=S,Se) with the same structure. In
this paper, we theoretically investigate the dynamical properties of such
compounds. Furthermore, we study the possibility of realizing
Pt$_{3}$Pb$_{2}Ch_{2}$ with the shandite structure. We show that the
Pd$_{3}$Pb$_{2}${\it Ch}$_{2}$ and Pt$_{3}$Pb$_{2}$S$_{2}$ are stable with
R$\bar{3}$m symmetry. In the case of Pt$_{3}$Pb$_{2}$S$_{2}$, there is a soft
mode, which is the source of the structural phase transition from R$\bar{3}$m
to R$\bar{3}$c symmetry, related to the distortion within the kagome
sublattice. We discuss realized phonon nodal lines in the bulk phonon
dispersions in upper frequency modes. We show that the shandite structure can
host the phonon surface states, with strong dependence by the surface kind.
Additionally, chiral phonons with circular motion of the Pb atoms around the
equilibrium position are realized.

<h3>A [3]-catenane non-autonomous molecular motor model: geometric phase,  no-pumping theorem, and energy transduction</h3>

<br>
We study a model of synthetic molecular motor - a [3]-catenane consisting of
two small macrocycles mechanically interlocked with a bigger one - subjected to
a time-dependent driving using stochastic thermodynamics. The model presents
nontrivial features due to the two interacting small macrocycles, but is simple
enough to be treated analytically in limiting regimes. Among the results
obtained, we find a mapping into an equivalent [2]-catenane that reveals the
implications of the no-pumping theorem stating that to generate net motion of
the small macrocycles, both energies and barriers need to change. In the
adiabatic limit (slow driving), we fully characterize the motor's dynamics and
show that the net motion of the small macrocycles is expressed as a surface
integral in parameter space which corrects previous erroneous results. We also
analyze the performance of the motor subjected to a step-wise driving protocols
in absence and in presence of an applied load. Optimization strategies for
generating large currents and maximizing free-energy transduction are proposed.
This simple model provides interesting clues into the working principles of
non-autonomous molecular motors and their optimization.

Gate-layouts of spin qubit devices are commonly adapted from previous
successful devices. As qubit numbers and the device complexity increase,
modelling new device layouts and optimizing for yield and performance becomes
necessary. Simulation tools from advanced semiconductor industry need to be
adapted for smaller structure sizes and electron numbers. Here, we present a
general approach for electrostatically modelling new spin qubit device layouts,
considering gate voltages, heterostructures, reservoirs and an applied
source-drain bias. Exemplified by a specific potential, we study the influence
of each parameter. We verify our model by indirectly probing the potential
landscape of two design implementations through transport measurements. We use
the simulations to identify critical design areas and optimize for robustness
with regard to influence and resolution limits of the fabrication process.

<br>
<br>
Multiple dopant configurations of Te impurities in close vicinity in silicon
are investigated using photoelectron spectroscopy, photoelectron diffraction,
and Bloch wave calculations. The samples are prepared by ion implantation
followed by pulsed laser annealing. The dopant concentration is variable and
high above the solubility limit of Te in silicon. The configurations in
question are distinguished from isolated Te impurities by a strong chemical
core level shift. While Te clusters are found to form only in very small
concentrations, multi-Te configurations of type dimer or up to four Te ions
surrounding a vacancy are clearly identified. For these configurations a
substitutional site location of Te is found to match the data best in all
cases. For isolated Te ions this matches the expectations. For multi-Te
configurations the results contribute to understanding the exceptional
activation of free charge carriers in hyperdoping of chalcogens in silicon.

Antiferromagnetic transition metal oxides are an established and widely
studied materials system in the context of spin-based electronics, commonly
used as passive elements in exchange bias-based memory devices. Currently,
major interest has resurged due to the recent observation of long-distance spin
transport, current-induced switching, and THz emission. As a result, insulating
transition metal oxides are now considered to be attractive candidates for
active elements in novel spintronic devices. Here, we discuss some of the most
promising materials systems and highlight recent advances in reading and
writing antiferromagnetic ordering. This article aims to provide an overview of
the current research and potential future directions in the field of
antiferromagnetic insulatronics.

<h3>Wigner-Seitz truncated TDDFT approach for the calculation of exciton  binding energies in solids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) has been currently
established as a computationally cheaper, yet effective, alternative to the
Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) for calculating the optical properties of
solids. Within the Linear Response formalism, the optical absorption spectra
are in good agreement with experiments, as well as the direct determination of
the exciton binding energies. However, the family of exchange-correlation
kernels known as long-range corrected (LRC) kernels that correctly capture
excitonic features have difficulties simultaneously producing good-looking
spectra and accurate exciton binding energies. More recently, this discrepancy
has been partially overcome by a hybrid-TDDFT approach. We show that the key
resides in the numerical treatment of the long-range Coulomb singular term. We
carefully study the effect of this term, both in the pure-TDDFT and hybrid
approach using a Wigner-Seitz truncated kernel. We find that computing this
term presents technical difficulties that are hard to overcome in both
approaches, and that points to the need for a better description of the
electron-hole interaction.

The separation of liquid mixture components is relevant in many
applications--going from water purification to biofuel production--and a
growing concern related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as
``Clean water and Sanitation'' and ``Affordable and clean energy''. One
promising technique is using graphene slit-pores as filters, or sponges,
because the confinement potentially affects the properties of the mixture
components in different ways, favoring their separation. However, no systematic
study shows how the size of a pore changes the thermodynamics of the
surrounding mixture. Here, we focus on water-methanol mixtures and explore,
using Molecular Dynamics simulations, the effects of a graphene pore, with size
ranging from 6.5 to 13 \AA, for three compositions: pure water, 90\%-10\%, and
75\%-25\% water-methanol. We show that tuning the pore size can change the
mixture pressure, density, and composition in bulk due to the size-dependent
methanol sequestration within the pore. Our results can help in optimizing the
graphene pore size for filtering applications.

We investigate the life cycle of the large amplitude Higgs mode in strongly
interacting superfluid Fermi gas. Through numerical simulations with
time-dependent density-functional theory and the technique of the interaction
quench, we verify the previous theoretical predictions on the mode's frequency.
Next, we demonstrate that the mode is dynamically unstable against external
perturbation and qualitatively examine the emerging state after the mode
decays. The post-decay state is characterized by spatial fluctuations of the
order parameter and density at scales comparable to the superfluid coherence
length scale. We identify similarities with FFLO states, which become more
prominent at higher dimensionalities and nonzero spin imbalances.

Here we develop a new scheme of projective quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC)
simulation combining unbiased zero-temperature (projective) determinant QMC and
variational Monte-Carlo based on Gutzwiller projection wave function, dubbed as
``Gutzwiller projection QMC''. The numerical results demonstrate that
employment of Gutzwiller projection trial wave function with minimum energy
strongly speed up the convergence of computational results, thus tremendously
reducing computational time in the simulation. More remarkably, we present an
example that sign problem is enormously alleviated in the Gutzwiller projection
QMC, especially in the regime where sign problem is severe. Hence, we believe
that Gutzwiller projection QMC paves a new route to improving the efficiency,
and alleviating sign problem in QMC simulation on interacting fermionic
systems.

<h3>SLD Fisher information for kinetic uncertainty relations</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate a symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) Fisher information
for kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) of open quantum systems described by
the GKSL quantum master equation with and without the detailed balance
condition. In a quantum kinetic uncertainty relation derived by Vu-Saito [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 128, 140602 (2022)], the Fisher information of probability of
quantum trajectory with a time-rescaling parameter plays an essential role.
This Fisher information is upper bounded by the SLD Fisher information. For a
finite time and arbitrary initial state, we give concise coupled first-order
ordinary differential equations to calculate the SLD Fisher information given
by a double integral concerning time. We also derive a simple lower bound of
the Fisher information of quantum trajectory. The SLD Fisher information also
appears in the speed limit based on the Mandelstam-Tamm relation [Hasegawa,
arXiv:2203.12421v4]. When the jump operators connect eigenstates of the system
Hamiltonian, we show that the Bures angle is upper bounded by the square root
of the dynamical activity at short times, which contrasts with the classical
counterpart.

<h3>Polycrystalinity enhances stress build-up around ice</h3>

Damage caused by freezing wet, porous materials is a widespread problem, but
is hard to predict or control. Here, we show that polycrystallinity makes a
great difference to the stress build-up process that underpins this damage.
Unfrozen water in grain-boundary grooves feeds ice growth at temperatures below
the freezing temperature, leading to the fast build-up of localized stresses.
The process is very variable, which we ascribe to local differences in
ice-grain orientation, and to the surprising mobility of many grooves -- which
further accelerates stress build-up. Our work will help understand how freezing
damage occurs, and in developing accurate models and effective
damage-mitigation strategies.

The thermal conductivity of a $d=1$ lattice of ferromagnetically coupled
planar rotators is studied through molecular dynamics. Two different types of
anisotropies (local and in the coupling) are assumed in the inertial XY model.
In the limit of extreme anisotropy, both models approach the Ising model and
its thermal conductivity $\kappa$, which, at high temperatures, scales like
$\kappa\sim T^{-3}$. This behavior reinforces the result obtained in various
$d$-dimensional models, namely $\kappa \propto L\,
e_{q}^{-B(L^{\gamma}T)^{\eta}}$ where $e_q^z
\equiv[1+(1-q)z]^{\frac{1}{1-q}}\;(e_1^z=e^z)$, $L$ being the linear size of
the $d$-dimensional macroscopic lattice. The scaling law $\frac{\eta
\,\gamma}{q-1}=1$ guarantees the validity of Fourier's law, $\forall d$.

In solids, chemical short-range order (CSRO) refers to the self-organisation
of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is
increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional
properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and
the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains
remain elusive. Herein, we showcase how machine learning-enhanced atom probe
tomography (APT) can mine the near-atomically resolved APT data and jointly
exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative
analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy. We reveal multiple CSRO
configurations, with their formation supported by state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo
simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows us to establish
relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The
unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing
advanced materials by manipulating atomic-scale architectures.

<h3>"Ultima Ratio": Simulating wide-range X-ray scattering and diffraction</h3>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a strategy for simulating wide-range X-ray scattering
patterns, which spans the small- and wide scattering angles as well as the
scattering angles typically used for Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis.
Such simulated patterns can be used to test holistic analysis models, and,
since the diffraction intensity is on the same scale as the scattering
intensity, may offer a novel pathway for determining the degree of
crystallinity.
The "Ultima Ratio" strategy is demonstrated on a 64-nm Metal Organic
Framework (MOF) particle, calculated from Q < 0.01 1/nm up to Q < 150 1/nm,
with a resolution of 0.16 Angstrom. The computations exploit a modified 3D Fast
Fourier Transform (3D-FFT), whose modifications enable the transformations of
matrices at least up to 8000^3 voxels in size. Multiple of these modified
3D-FFTs are combined to improve the low-Q behaviour. The resulting curve is
compared to a wide-range scattering pattern measured on a polydisperse MOF
powder. While computationally intensive, the approach is expected to be useful
for simulating scattering from a wide range of realistic, complex structures,
from (poly-)crystalline particles to hierarchical, multicomponent structures
such as viruses and catalysts.

Understanding the doped Mott insulator is a central challenge in condensed
matter physics. This study identifies an intrinsic Berry-phase-like sign
structure for the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with the nearest-neighbor
($t$) and next-nearest-neighbor hopping ($t'$), which could help explain the
origin of the quasi-long-range superconducting and stripe phases observed
through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculation. We first
demonstrate that the hole binding underlies both the superconducting and stripe
orders, and then show that the hole pairing generically disappears once the
phase-string or mutual statistics component of the sign structure is switched
off in DMRG calculation. In the latter case, the superexchange interaction no
longer plays a crucial role in shaping the charge dynamics, where a
Fermi-liquid-like phase with small hole Fermi pockets is found. It is in sharp
contrast to the large Fermi surfaces in either the stripe phase found at
$t'/t<0$ or the superconducting phase at $t'/t>0$ in the original $t$-$t'$-$J$
model on the 6-leg ladder.

As a prototypical example for a heterostructure combining a weakly and a
strongly interacting quantum many-body system, we study the interface between a
semiconductor and a Mott insulator. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we
derive and match the propagating or evanescent quasi-particle solutions on both
sides. We find some similarities between the weakly and the strongly
interacting case, but also qualitative distinctions. As one consequence,
tunnelling through a Mott insulating layer behaves quite different from a
semiconducting (or band insulating) layer. For example, we find a strong
suppression of tunnelling for energies in the middle between the upper and
lower Hubbard band of the Mott insulator.

A chain of magnetic impurities deposited on the surface of a superconductor
can form a topological Shiba band that supports Majorana zero modes and hold a
promise for topological quantum computing. Yet, most experiments scrutinizing
these zero modes rely on transport measurements, which only capture local
properties. Here we propose to leverage the intrinsic dynamics of the magnetic
impurities to access their non-local character. We use linear response theory
to determine the dynamics of the uniform magnonic mode in the presence of
external $ac$ magnetic fields and the coupling to the Shiba electrons. We
demonstrate that this mode, which spreads over the entire chain of atoms,
becomes imprinted with the parity of the ground state and, moreover, can
discriminate between Majorana and trivial zero modes located at the end of the
chain. Our approach offers a non-invasive alternative to the scanning
tunnelling microscopy techniques used to probe Majorana zero modes. Conversely,
the magnons could facilitate the manipulation of Majorana zero modes in
topological Shiba chains.
