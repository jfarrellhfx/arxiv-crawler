<h3>Moss-like growth of metal electrodes: On the role of competing faradaic  reactions and fast-charging</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10232" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10232</a>

Uncontrolled crystal growth during electroreduction of reactive metals in
liquid electrolytes produces porous, low-density, mossy metal deposits that
grow primarily along the surface normal vector to a planar electrode substrate.
The moss-like deposits are fragile and cause premature failure of batteries by
chemical, physical, and mechanical pathways. Here we use electroanalytical
Rotating-Disk Electrode (RDE) studies in a three-electrode electrochemical cell
to elucidate the fundamental origin of moss-like growth of metals. We report
that competing Faradaic reactions occurring on the electrode surface is the
source of the phenomenon. On this basis, we conclude that a moss-like growth
regime can be accessed during electrodeposition of any metal by subtle shifts
in electrolyte chemistry and deposition rate. Specifically, for Zn, a metal
that conventionally is not known to form moss-like electrodeposits, obvious
moss-like deposition patterns emerge at low-current densities in
strongly-alkaline electrolytes that undergo electroreduction to form an
interphase on the electrodeposited Zn. Conversely, we find that under
conditions where the rate of metal electroplating is large relative to that of
other competing Faradaic reactions, it is possible to eliminate the mossy-like
growth regime for Zn. Taken together, our findings open up a new approach for
simultaneously achieving favorable metal deposition morphology and fast
charging in next-generation batteries using metal anodes.

<h3>Hydrodynamic Interactions in Ion Transport -- Theory and Simulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10330" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10330</a>

We present a hydrodynamic theory describing pair diffusion in systems with
periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing earlier work on
self-diffusion [D\"unweg and Kremer, J. Chem. Phys. 1993, 99, 6983-6997; Yeh
and Hummer, J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 15873-15879]. Its predictions are
compared to Molecular Dynamics simulations for a liquid carbonate electrolyte
and two ionic liquids, for which we characterize the correlated motion between
distinct ions. Overall, we observe good agreement between theory and simulation
data, highlighting that hydrodynamic interactions universally dictate ion
correlations. However, when summing over all ion pairs in the system to obtain
the cross-contributions to the total cationic or anionic conductivity, the
hydrodynamic interactions between ions with like and unlike charges largely
cancel. Consequently, significant conductivity contributions only arise from
deviations from a hydrodynamic flow field of an ideal fluid, that is, from the
local electrolyte structure as well as from relaxation processes in the
subdiffusive regime. In case of ionic liquids, the momentum-conservation
constraint additionally is vital, which we study by employing different ionic
masses in the simulations. Our formalism will likely also be helpful to
estimate finite-size effects of the conductivity or of Maxwell-Stefan
diffusivities in simulations.

<h3>Molecular chaos in dense active systems</h3>

The hypothesis of molecular chaos plays the central role in kinetic theory,
which provides a closure leading to the Boltzmann equation for quantitative
description of classic fluids. Yet how to properly extend it to active systems
is still an open question in nonequilibrium physics. Combining experiment,
simulation, and theory, we investigate the emergent collective behaviors of
self-propelled particles that exhibit collision avoidance, a moving strategy
commonly adopted in natural and engineering active systems. This dense active
system shows unusual phase dynamics strongly regulated by many-body
interactions, which cannot be explained by theories assuming molecular chaos.
To rationalize the interplay between different emergent phases, a simple
kinetic model is proposed with a revised molecular chaos hypothesis, which
treats the many-body effect implicitly via categorizing different types of
particle pair collisions. Our model predicts an optimal growth rate of flocking
and illustrates a generic approach for understanding dense active systems.

Since its discovery more than a century ago, superconductivity has been at
the epicentre of condensed matter physics research. The electron phonon
coupling in conventional superconductors, which obeys BCS theory, causes an
attractive interaction, resulting in a unique isotropic and fixed sign pairing
symmetry ground state. Exotic pairing symmetries are hard to come by in this
favourable interaction. While unconventional superconductivity is still a
mystery, the potential for novel and exotic coupling symmetries due to the
interplay of structural symmetries and Fermi surface (FS) topology makes it a
fascinating research issue. In this thesis, we have investigated the magnetic,
transport, and microscopic properties of the conventional superconductors
HfIrSi, ZrIrSi, and novel superconductors ThCoC$_{2}$, CeIr$_{3}$, primarily
through the use of a variety of complementary experimental techniques such as
low temperature resistivity, magnetization, heat capacity, and muon spin
rotation and relaxation measurements.

<h3>Quantum kinetics of quenched two-dimensional Bose superfluids</h3>

We study theoretically the non-equilibrium dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D)
uniform Bose superfluid following a quantum quench, from its short-time
(prethermal) coherent dynamics to its long-time thermalization. Using a quantum
hydrodynamic description combined with a Keldysh field formalism, we derive
quantum kinetic equations for the low-energy phononic excitations of the system
and characterize both their normal and anomalous momentum distributions. We
apply this formalism to the interaction quench of a 2D Bose gas and study the
ensuing dynamics of its quantum structure factor and coherence function, both
recently measured experimentally. Our results indicate that in two dimensions,
a description in terms of independent quasi-particles becomes quickly
inaccurate and should be systematically questioned when dealing with
non-equilibrium scenarios.

<h3>Maser Threshold Characterization by Resonator Q-Factor Tuning</h3>

The concepts for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
(maser) closely followed by the optical analogue, the laser, were developed in
the 1950s. Whereas the laser is now a ubiquitous technology, used in
fundamental science, industry and everyday life, applications for the maser
remain highly specialized e.g., for deep-space communication and astronomy.
Although the excellent low-noise microwave amplification properties of the
maser made it an attractive candidate for a broad range of applications, the
original maser systems required cryogenic temperatures and/or high vacuum
environments; both are major barriers for widespread applications. Thus, the
recent realization of a continuous-wave room-temperature maser, using NV$^-$
centers in diamond, reinvigorated the maser as an intriguing platform for
microwave research and development. Building on this work, we designed and
constructed an optimized setup in order to characterize the operating space of
a maser using NV$^-$ centers. Here we focus on the interplay of two key
parameters for continuous emission of microwave photons: the quality factor of
the microwave resonator and the degree of spin-level-inversion. We
characterized the performance of the maser as a function of these two
parameters, identified the parameter space of operation and could, thereby,
highlight the requirements for maximal continuous microwave emission.

<h3>Effect of pH on structure and surface charge of Fe$_2$O$_3$  nanoparticles synthesized at different pH conditions and correlation to  antibacterial properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10187</a>

pH of a solution is the ratio of H+/OH- ions. The relative ratio of these
charges may affect forming bonds during a hydrothermal synthesis by influencing
electronic clouds of participant ions, which can modify the structure and hence
crystallinity, strain, disorder, surface termination etc. These factors may
modify physical properties including the surface charge. This work uses
hematite nanoparticles to correlate the structural modifications to all these
properties and finally to the antibacterial properties due to the surface
charge interaction of the nanoparticles and the bacterial cell walls.

<h3>Effect of confinement and Coulomb interactions on the electronic  structure of (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10209" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10209</a>
<br>
<i>Mattia Trama, Vittorio Cataudella, Carmine Antonio Perroni, Francesco Romeo, Roberta Citro</i>
<br>
<br>
A tight binding supercell approach is used for the calculation of the
electronic structure of the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. The
confinement potential at the interface is evaluated solving a discrete Poisson
equation by means of an iterative method. In addition to the effect of the
confinement, local Hubbard electron-electron terms are included at mean-field
level within a fully self-consistent procedure. The calculation carefully
describes how the two-dimensional electron gas arises from the quantum
confinement of electrons near the interface due to band bending potential. The
resulting electronic sub-bands and Fermi surfaces show full agreement with the
electronic structure determined by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy
experiments. In particular, it is analyzed how the effect of local Hubbard
interactions changes the density distribution over the layers from the
interface to the bulk. Interestingly, the two-dimensional electron gas at
interface is not depleted by local Hubbard interactions which indeed induce an
enhancement of the electron density between the first layers and the bulk.

Unit cells are used to represent crystallographic lattices. Calculations
measuring the differences between unit cells are used to provide metrics for
measuring meaningful distances between three-dimensional crystallographic
lattices. This is a surprisingly complex and computationally demanding problem.
We present a review of the current best practice using Delaunay-reduced unit
cells in the six-dimensional real space of Selling scalar cells S6 and the
equivalent three-dimensional complex space C3. The process is a simplified
version of the process needed when working with the more complex
six-dimensional real space of Niggli-reduced unit cells G6. Obtaining a
distance begins with identification of the fundamental region in the space,
continues with conversion to primitive cells and reduction, analysis of
distances to the boundaries of the fundamental unit, and is completed by a
comparison of direct paths to boundary-interrupted paths, looking for a path of
minimal length.

<h3>Hot-electron dynamics in plasmonic nanostructures</h3>

The coherent oscillations of mobile charge carriers near the surface of good
conductors -- surface plasmons -- are being exploited in many applications in
information technologies, clean energy, high-density data storage,
photovoltaics, chemistry, biology, medicine and security. Light can be coupled
to surface plasmons and trapped near the interface between a metal and an
adjacent material. This leads to the nanoscale confinement of light, impossible
by any other means, and a related electromagnetic field enhancement.
Microscopic electron dynamic effects associated with surface plasmons are
capable of significantly influencing physical and chemical processes near a
conductor surface, not only as a result of the high electric fields, but also
via the excitation of energetic charge carriers: holes below Fermi level or
electrons above it. When remaining inside plasmonic media, these so-called hot
carriers result in nonlinear, Kerr-type, optical effects important for
controlling light with light. They can also transfer into the surroundings of
the nanostructures, resulting in photocurrent, or they can interact with
adjacent molecules and materials, leading to photochemical transformations.
Understanding the dynamics of hot carriers and related effects in plasmonic
nanostructures is important for the development of ultrafast detectors and
nonlinear optical components, broadband photocatalysis, enhanced nanoscale
optoelectronic devices, nanoscale and ultrafast temperature control, and other
technologies of tomorrow. In this review, we will discuss the basics of
plasmonically-engendered hot electrons, theoretical descriptions and
experimental methods to study them, and describe prototypical processes and
examples of most promising applications of hot-electron processes at the metal
interfaces.

<h3>Stability of destructive interference antiresonances in electron  transport through graphene nanostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10302</a>
<br>
<i>A. Valli, T. Fabian, F. Libisch, R. Stadler</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the stability of destructive quantum interference (DQI) in
electron transport through graphene nanostructures connected to source and
drain electrodes. The fingerprint of DQI is the presence of an antiresonance in
the transmission function, and its origin is deeply connected to the topology
of the atomic structure, which we discuss in terms of symmetry arguments
supported by numerical simulations. A systematic analysis of the influence of
system size on the transmission function reveals that the DQI antiresonance
persists for large systems in the ballistic regime and establishes the quantum
confinement gap as the intrinsic resolution limit to detect QI effects.
Furthermore, we consider the influence of disorder, electron-electron and
electron-phonon interactions, and provide quantitative criteria for the
robustness of DQI in their presence. We find that the conductance is quite
sensitive to perturbations, and its value alone may not be sufficient to
characterize the QI properties of a junction. Instead, the characteristic
behavior of the transmission function is more resilient, and we suggest it
retains information on the presence of an antiresonance even if DQI is
partially concealed or suppressed. At the same time, DQI results in a
non-linear transport regime in the current-bias characteristics that can be
possibly detected in transport experiments.

<h3>ELECTRON TRANSPORT AND ELECTRON DENSITY INSIDE ONE-DIMENSIONAL  DISORDERED CONDUCTORS: An Analysis of the Electronic-Levels Contribution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10304</a>
<br>
<i>Gerardo Rivas, Miztli Yepez, Pier A. Mello</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the problem of electron transport along a one-dimensional
disordered multiple-scattering conductor, and study the electron density for
all the electronic levels. A model is proposed for the reduced density matrix
of the system placed between two reservoirs at different chemical potentials,
and the statistical-mechanical expectation value of the electron density is
evaluated. An ensemble average is computed over disordered configurations. We
compare its predictions with computer simulations. We find that the
contribution of low-lying levels is very different from that of the high-lying
ones studied in the past. Going down in energy, the wave function penetrates
ever less inside the sample. For high-lying levels, this is interpreted in
terms of localization from disorder. For low-lying levels, this interpretation
gradually gives way to an understanding in terms of the increasing reflection
produced by each scatterer, which is seen by the electron as a higher and
higher -- and hence impenetrable -- potential barrier. Indeed, the
local-density-of-states, LDOS, is gradually depleted in the interior of the
system, since the wave function is ever smaller inside. The problem studied
here is also of interest in electromagnetic, thermal, and acoustic transport in
disordered systems.

<h3>Extended spatial coherence of interlayer excitons in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$  heterobilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on the spatial coherence of interlayer exciton ensembles as formed
in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures and characterized by point-inversion
Michelson-Morley interferometry. Below 10 K, the measured spatial coherence
length of the interlayer excitons reaches values equivalent to the lateral
expansion of the exciton ensembles. In this regime, the light emission of the
excitons turns out to be homogeneously broadened in energy with a high temporal
coherence. At higher temperatures, both the spatial coherence length and the
temporal coherence time decrease, most likely because of thermal processes. The
presented findings point towards a spatially extended, coherent many-body state
of interlayer excitons at low temperature.

<h3>Uniaxial modulation and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition</h3>

<i>Domenico Giuliano, Phong H. Nguyen, Andrea Nava, Massimo Boninsegni</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition of a two-dimensional superfluid in the presence of an externally
imposed density modulation along a single axis. The subject is investigated in
the context of the $|\psi|^4$ classical field theory, by means of analytical
and numerical techniques. We show that, as the amplitude of the modulation
increases, the physics of the system approaches that of the anisotropic $x$-$y$
model, with a suppressed superfluid transition temperature and an anisotropic
response, but with no dimensional crossover.

<h3>Thermal effects on the spin domain phases of high spin-f Bose-Einstein  condensates with rotational symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10337</a>
<br>
<i>E. Serrano-Ens√°stiga, F. Mireles</i>
<br>
<br>
Spinor Bose Einstein condensates (BEC) can be realized nowadays using
different atomic species of several spin values, offering unprecedented
opportunities to scrutinize the underlying physics of its spin phase domains
and of its quantum phase transitions. At sufficient low temperatures, lower
than the critical temperature, a fraction of thermally excited atoms of the
condensate can still interact with the whole system leading to spin-dependent
interactions that can modify the nature of its phase domains. In this work, we
characterize the thermal fraction of atoms of a spinorial BEC of general spin-f
value, provided that its ground state lies in a given spin phase with
rotational symmetry. To that end, we use the Hartree-Fock approximation and the
method we have introduced in the companion article [arXiv:2211.16428 [1]],
based on the Majorana stellar representation for mixed quantum states and
symmetry arguments. We consider the spin phases with usual point group
symmetries, including those with some exotic phases associated to the platonic
solids. The method leads to useful analytical expressions of the eigenspectrum
of the thermal cloud allowing us to study the admissible regions and multipolar
magnetic moments of the spin phases as a function of the temperature for
general spin values.

<h3>Strong Fiber from Uniaxial Fullerene Supramolecules Aligned with Carbon  Nanotubes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Carbon nanotube (CNT) wires approach copper's specific conductivity and
surpass carbon fiber's strength, with further improvement anticipated with
greater aspect ratios and incorporation of dopants with long-range structural
order. Fullerenes assemble into multitudes of process-dependent supramolecular
crystals and, while initially insulating, they become marginally conductive (up
to 0.05 MSm$^{-1}$) and superconductive ($T_c=18^\circ$K with K and 28$^\circ$K
with Rb) after doping. These were small (100's $\mu$m long), soft (hardness
comparable to indium), and typically unaligned, which hindered development of
fullerene based wires. Individual fullerenes were previously incorporated into
CNT fibers, although randomly without self-assembly into supramolecules. Here,
a simple variation in established CNT acid extrusion creates a fiber composed
of uniaxial chains of aligned fullerene supramolecules, self-assembled between
aligned few-walled CNT bundles. This will provide a testbed for novel fullerene
wire transport and prospects in CNT wire advancement.

<h3>Controlling dark solitons on the healing length scale</h3>

While usually the optical diffraction limit is setting a limit for the
lengthscales on which a typical alkali Bose-Einstein condensate can be
controlled, we show that in certain situations control via matter waves can
achieve smaller resolutions. For this we consider a small number of impurity
atoms which are trapped inside the density dip of a dark soliton state and show
that any grey soliton can be obtained by just driving the impurity atoms. By
controlling the driving force on the impurity, one can therefore fully control
the position and velocity of the dark soliton, and also study controlled
collisions between these non-linear objects.

<h3>Predicting the Early Stages of Solid-State Precipitation in Al-rich  Al-Pt Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10399" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10399</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The high strength of structural aluminium alloys depends strongly on the
controlled precipitation of specific intermetallic phases, whose identity and
crystal structure can be difficult to predict. Here, we investigate the Al-Pt
system, which shows some similarity to the Al-Cu system as one of their main
intermetallic phases, $Al_2Pt$, is nearly isostructural with $\theta^{\prime}
(Al_2Cu)$, the metastable phase responsible for the high-strength of Al-Cu
alloys. However, phases in Al-Pt alloys are complex and have not been studied
in detail. Using a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
and classical nucleation theory (CNT) applied to the Al-Pt system, we design a
workflow to predict the thermodynamics of solid solution, intermediate phases
such as GP zones, stable and metastable precipitates, and their precipitation
sequence. This workflow can be applied to an arbitrary binary alloying system.
We confirm the known stable phases $Al_4Pt$, $Al_{21}Pt_8$, $Al_2Pt$,
$Al_3Pt_2$, $AlPt (\alpha \& \beta)$, $Al_3Pt_5$, $AlPt_2 (\alpha \& \beta)$
and $AlPt_3 (\alpha \& \beta)$. We also reveal the possible existence of two
phases of chemical formulae $Al_5Pt$ and $Al_3Pt$. This large number of
intermetallic phases is due to the strong bonding between Al and Pt, which also
leads to significant favourable Pt solute formation energy in the Al matrix.
Our findings are compared with the known precipitation characteristics of the
binary Al-Cu and Al-Au systems. We find that the $\theta^{\prime}$-like
$Al_2Pt$ precipitate phase has a lower coherent interfacial energy than
$\theta^{\prime}$. Our calculations strongly suggest that $Al_2Pt$ will
precipitate first in Al-rich Al-Pt alloys and will form bulk-like interfaces
similar to $\eta (Al_2Au)$ rather than like $\theta^{\prime}(Al_2Cu)$.

<br>
<br>
We report the observation for the p$_{z}$ electron band and the band
inversion in Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ with angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found that excess Fe (y>0) inhibits the
topological band inversion in Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$, which explains the
absence of Majorana zero modes in previous reports for
Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ with excess Fe. Based on our analysis of different
amounts of Te doping and excess Fe, we propose a delicate topological phase in
this material. Thanks to this delicate phase, one may be able to tune the
topological transition via applying lattice strain or carrier doping.

<h3>A composite electrodynamic mechanism to reconcile spatiotemporally  resolved exciton transport in quantum dot superlattices</h3>

Quantum dot (QD) solids are promising optoelectronic materials; further
advancing their function in devices is dependent on understanding their energy
transport mechanisms. The commonly invoked near-field F\"orster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) theory often underestimates the exciton hopping rate in
QD solids, yet no consensus exists on the underlying cause. In response, we use
time-resolved ultrafast stimulated emission depletion (TRUSTED) microscopy, an
ultrafast transformation of STED microscopy to spatiotemporally resolve exciton
diffusion in tellurium-doped CdSe-core/CdS-shell QD superlattices. We measure
the concomitant time-resolved exciton energy decay due to excitons sampling a
heterogeneous energetic landscape within the superlattice. The heterogeneity is
quantified by single-particle emission spectroscopy. This powerful multimodal
set of observables provides sufficient constraints on a kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation of exciton transport to elucidate a composite transport mechanism
that includes both near-field FRET and previously-neglected far-field
emission/reabsorption contributions. Uncovering this mechanism offers a
much-needed unified framework in which to characterize transport in QD solids
and new principles for device design.

<h3>Creation of crystal structure reproducing X-ray diffraction pattern  without using database</h3>

When a sample's X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) is measured, the
corresponding crystal structure is usually determined by searching for similar
XRD patterns in the database. However, if a similar XRD pattern is not found,
it is tremendously laborious to identify the crystal structure even for
experts. This case commonly happens when researchers develop novel and complex
materials. In this study, we propose a crystal structure creation scheme that
reproduces a given XRD pattern. We employed a combinatorial inverse design
method using an evolutionary algorithm and crystal morphing (Evolv&Morph)
supported by Bayesian optimization, which maximizes the similarity of the XRD
patterns between target one and those of the created crystal structures. For
twelve different crystal structure systems, Evolv&Morph successfully created
crystal structures with the same XRD pattern as the target (cosine similarity >
99%). Furthermore, the present method has merits in that it is an automated
crystal structure creation scheme, not dependent on a database. We believe that
Evolv&Morph can be applied not only to determine crystal structures but also to
design materials for specific properties.

We study the one-dimensional tight-binding model with quasi-periodic
disorders, where the quasi-period is tuned to be very large. It is found that
this type of model with large quasi-periodic disorders can also support the
mobility edges, which is very similar to the models with slowly varying
quasi-periodic disorders. The energy matching method is employed to determine
the locations of mobility edges in both types of models. These results of
mobility edges are verified by numerical calculations in various examples. We
also provide a qualitative arguments to support the fact that large
quasi-periodic disorders will lead to the existence of mobility edges.

<br>
<br>
Using a Becker-D\"oring type model including cluster incorporation, we study
the possibility of conversion of stable crystals to metastable crystals in a
solution by a periodic change of temperature. At low temperature, both stable
and metastable crystals grow by coalescence with abundant clusters. At high
temperature, a large amount of small clusters produced by the dissolution of
crystals inhibits the dissolution of crystals, and the imbalance in the amount
of crystals increases. By repeating this process, the periodic temperature
change can convert stable crystals into metastable crystals.

Stochastic chemical processes are described by the chemical master equation
satisfying the law of mass-action. We first ask whether the dual master
equation, which has the same steady state as the chemical master equation, but
with inverted reaction currents, satisfies the law of mass-action, namely,
still describes a chemical process. We prove that the answer depends on the
topological property of the underlying chemical reaction network known as
deficiency. The answer is yes only for deficiency-zero networks. It is no for
all other networks, implying that their steady-state currents cannot be
inverted by controlling the kinetic constants of the reactions. Hence, the
network deficiency imposes a form of non-invertibility to the chemical
dynamics. We then ask whether catalytic chemical networks are deficiency-zero.
We prove that the answer is no when they are driven out of equilibrium due to
the exchange of some species with the environment.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic garnets such as yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG) are
widely used in spintronic and magnonic devices. Their magnetic and
magneto-optical properties can be modified over a wide range by tailoring their
chemical composition. Here, we report the successful growth of Al-substituted
yttrium iron garnet (YAlIG) thin films via radio frequency sputtering in
combination with an ex situ annealing step. Upon selecting appropriate process
parameters, we obtain highly crystalline YAlIG films with different Al$^{3+}$
substitution levels on both, single crystalline Y$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$ (YAG) and
Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (GGG) substrates. With increasing Al$^{3+}$ substitution
levels, we observe a reduction of the saturation magnetisation as well as a
systematic decrease of the magnetic ordering temperature to values well below
room temperature. YAlIG thin films thus provide an interesting material
platform for spintronic and magnonic experiments in different magnetic phases.

<h3>Combined electronic excitation and knock-on damage in monolayer MoS2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electron irradiation-induced damage is often the limiting factor in imaging
materials prone to ionization or electronic excitations due to inelastic
electron scattering. Quantifying the related processes at the atomic scale has
only become possible with the advent of aberration-corrected (scanning)
transmission electron microscopes and 2D materials that allow imaging each
lattice atom. While it has been shown for graphene that pure knock-on damage
arising from elastic scattering is sufficient to describe the observed damage,
the situation is more complicated with semiconducting materials such as MoS2.
Here, we measure the displacement cross section for sulfur atoms in MoS2 with
primary beam energies between 55 and 90 keV, and correlate the results with
existing measurements and theoretical models. Our experimental data suggests
that the displacement process can occur from the ground state, or with single
or multiple excitations, all caused by the same impinging electron. The results
bring light to reports in the recent literature, and add necessary experimental
data for a comprehensive description of electron irradiation damage in a
semiconducting material. Specifically, the results agree with a combined
inelastic and elastic damage mechanism at intermediate energies, in addition to
a pure elastic mechanism that dominates above 80 keV. When the inelastic
contribution is assumed to arise through impact ionization, the associated
excitation lifetime is on the order of picoseconds, on par with expected
excitation lifetimes in MoS2 , whereas it drops to some tens of femtoseconds
when direct valence excitation is considered.

<h3>Hybridization-Controlled Pseudogap State in the Quantum Critical  Superconductor CeCoIn5</h3>

<br>
<br>
The origin of the partial suppression of the electronic density states in the
enigmatic pseudogap behavior, which is at the core of understanding high-$T_c$
superconductivity, has been hotly contested as either a hallmark of preformed
Cooper pairs or an incipient order of competing interactions nearby. Here, we
report the quasi-particle scattering spectroscopy of the quantum critical
superconductor CeCoIn$_5$, where a pseudogap with energy $\Delta_g$ was
manifested as a dip in the differential conductance ($dI/dV$) below the
characteristic temperature of $T_g$. When subjected to external pressure, $T_g$
and $\Delta_g$ gradually increase, following the trend of increase in quantum
entangled hybridization between Ce 4$f$ moment and conduction electrons. On the
other hand, the superconducting (SC) energy gap and its phase transition
temperature shows a maximum, revealing a dome shape under pressure. The
disparate dependence on pressure between the two quantum states shows that the
pseudogap is less likely involved in the formation of SC Cooper pairs, but
rather is controlled by Kondo hybridization, indicating that a novel type of
pseudogap is realized in CeCoIn$_5$.

Detecting magnetic noise from small quantities of paramagnetic spins is a
powerful capability for chemical, biochemical, and medical analysis. Quantum
sensors based on optically addressable spin defects in bulk semiconductors are
typically employed for such purposes, but the 3D crystal structure of the
sensor inhibits the sensitivity by limiting the proximity of the defects to the
target spins. Here we demonstrate the detection of paramagnetic spins using
spin defects hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a van der Waals material
which can be exfoliated into the 2D regime. We first create negatively charged
boron vacancy (V$_{\rm B}^-$) defects in a powder of ultrathin hBN nanoflakes
($<10$~atomic monolayers thick on average) and measure the longitudinal spin
relaxation time ($T_1$) of this system. We then decorate the dry hBN nanopowder
with paramagnetic Gd$^{3+}$ ions and observe a clear $T_1$ quenching, under
ambient conditions, consistent with the added magnetic noise. Finally, we
demonstrate the possibility of performing spin measurements including $T_1$
relaxometry using solution-suspended hBN nanopowder. Our results highlight the
potential and versatility of the hBN quantum sensor for a range of sensing
applications, and pave the way towards the realisation of a truly 2D,
ultrasensitive quantum sensor.

<h3>Probing Majorana bound states through an inhomogeneous Andreev double  dot interferometer</h3>

<br>
<br>
In modern experiments with hybrid superconducting (SC)/semiconducting
nanowires the presence of zero-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs),
characterized by a partial overlap of the Majorana wave functions, is a common
problem that significantly complicates the detection of a genuine Majorana
bound state (MBS). In this article, taking into account spatial inhomogeneity
of experimentally investigated nanowire samples, we study interference
transport features of a curved heterostructure in which two normal wires (or
arms) are separated by a superconducting wire. Since Andreev reflection on the
two N/S interfaces with smoothly changing electrostatic and SC pairing
potentials results in the emergence of bound states, the low-energy
interference transport is described in the framework of the model of two
noninteracting Andreev levels or the Andreev double quantum dot. A set of
limiting cases is analyzed allowing us to highlight the interference properties
that are unique for the different types of ABSs, such as bulk ABS,
inhomogeneous ABS and MBS. In particular, considerable attention is paid to the
features of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. It is shown that the response of
each state can be recognized analyzing both AB period and extrema positions of
the conductance oscillations which take place without any fine tuning of the
system parameters.

<h3>Holographic entanglement renormalisation for fermionic quantum matter:  geometrical and topological aspects</h3>

<br>
<br>
On performing a sequence of renormalisation group (RG) transformations on a
system of two-dimensional non-interacting Dirac fermions placed on a torus, we
demonstrate the emergence of an additional spatial dimension arising out of the
scaling of multipartite entanglement. The renormalisation of entanglement under
this flow exhibits a hierarchy across scales as well as number of parties.
Geometric measures defined in this emergent space, such as distances and
curvature, can be related to the RG beta function of the coupling $g$
responsible for the spectral gap. This establishes a holographic connection
between the spatial geometry of the emergent space in the bulk and the
entanglement properties of the quantum theory lying on its boundary. Depending
on the anomalous dimension of the coupling $g$, three classes of spaces
(bounded, unbounded and flat) are generated from the RG. We show that changing
from one class to another involves a topological transition. By minimising the
central charge of the conformal field theory describing the noninteracting
electrons under the RG flow, the RG transformations are shown to satisfy the
$c-$theorem of Zamolodchikov. This is shown to possess a dual within the
emergent geometric space, in the form of a convergence parameter that is
minimised at large distances. In the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux, the
entanglement gains a geometry-independent piece which is shown to be
topological, sensitive to changes in boundary conditions, and can be related to
the Luttinger volume of the system of electrons. In the presence of a strong
transverse magnetic field, the system becomes insulating and Luttinger's
theorem does not hold. We show instead that the entanglement contains a term
that can be related to the Chern numbers of the quantum Hall states. This
yields a relation between the topological invariants of the metallic and the
quantum Hall systems.

<h3>Giant Magneto-Optical Sch√§fer-Hubert Effect in Two-Dimensional van  der Waals Antiferromagnets \textit{M}PS$_3$ (\textit{M}=Mn, Fe, Ni)</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of long-range magnetic order in atomically thin films
has triggered particular interest in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW)
magnetic materials. In this paper, we perform a systematic theoretical study of
the magneto-optical Sch\"{a}fer-Hubert effect (MOSHE) in 2D vdW
antiferromagnetic \textit{M}PS$_3$ (\textit{M} = Mn, Fe, Ni) with multifold
intralayer and interlayer magnetic orders. The formula for evaluating the MOSHE
in 2D magnets is derived by considering the influence of a non-magnetic
substrate. The MOSHE of monolayer and bilayer \textit{M}PS$_3$ are considerably
large ($>2^{\circ}$), originating from the strong anisotropy of in-plane
optical conductivity. The Sch\"{a}fer-Hubert rotation angles are surprisingly
insensitive to the orientations of the N\'{e}el vector, while the
Sch\"{a}fer-Hubert ellipticities are identified to be a good criterion to
distinguish different interlayer magnetic orders. Our work establishes a
theoretical framework for exploring novel 2D vdW magnets and facilitates the
promising applications of the 2D \textit{M}PS$_3$ family in antiferromagnetic
nanophotonic devices.

Tailored magnetic multilayers (MMLs) provide skyrmions with enhanced thermal
stability, leading to the possibility of skyrmion-based devices for room
temperature applications. At the same time, the search for additional stable
topological spin textures has been under intense research focus. Besides their
fundamental importance, such textures may expand the information encoding
capability of spintronic devices. However, fractional spin texture states
within MMLs in the vertical dimension have yet to be investigated. In this
work, we demonstrate numerically fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) in a tailored
MML system. We subsequently propose to encode sequences of information signals
with fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) as information bits in a tailored MML
device. Micromagnetic simulations and theoretical calculations are used to
verify the feasibility of hosting distinct FST states within a single device,
and their thermal stability is investigated. A multilayer multiplexing device
is proposed, where multiple sequences of the information signals can be encoded
and transmitted based on the nucleation and propagation of packets of FSTs.
Finally, pipelined information transmission and automatic demultiplexing is
demonstrated by exploiting the skyrmion Hall effect and introducing
voltage-controlled synchronizers and width-based track selectors. The findings
indicate that FSTs can be potential candidates as information carriers for
future spintronic applications.

Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems possess versatile magnetic order and
can host tunable magnons carrying spin angular momenta. Recent advances show
angular momentum can also be carried by lattice vibrations in the form of
chiral phonons. However, the interplay between magnons and chiral phonons as
well as the details of chiral phonon formation in a magnetic system are yet to
be explored. Here, we report the observation of magnon-induced chiral phonons
and chirality selective magnon-phonon hybridization in the atomically thin 2D
antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator FePSe3. With a combination of
magneto-infrared and magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe chiral magnon
polarons (chiMP), the new hybridized quasiparticles, at zero magnetic field.
The hybridization gap reaches 0.25~meV and survives down to the quadrilayer
limit. Via first principle calculations, we uncover a coherent coupling between
AFM magnons and chiral phonons with parallel angular momenta, which arises from
the underlying phonon and space group symmetries. This coupling lifts the
chiral phonon degeneracy and gives rise to an unusual Raman circular
polarization of the chiMP branches. The observation of coherent chiral
spin-lattice excitations in the atomic limit and at zero magnetic field paves
the way for the angular momentum-based hybrid phononic and magnonic devices.

In this work, we combine electron microscopy measurements of the surface
compositions in Cu-Au nanoparticles and atomistic simulations to investigate
the effect of gold segregation. While this mechanism has been extensively
investigated within Cu-Au in the bulk state, it was never studied at the atomic
level in nanoparticles. By using energy dispersive X-ray analysis across the
(100) and (111) facets of nanoparticles, we provide evidence of gold
segregation in Cu$\_{3}$Au and CuAu$\_{3}$ nanoparticles in the 10 nm size
range grown by epitaxy on a salt surface with high control of the nanoparticles
morphology. To get atomic-scale insights into the segregation properties in
Cu-Au nanoparticles on the whole composition range, we perform Monte Carlo
calculations employing $N$-body interatomic potentials. These simulations
confirm this effect by showing a complete segregation of Au in the (100) and
(111) faces of a truncated octahedron for gold nominal composition of the alloy
above 70\% and 60\% respectively. Furthermore, we show that there is no size
effect on the segregation behaviour since we evidence the same oscillating
concentration profile from surface to the nanoparticles core as in the bulk.
These results can shed new lights in the interpretation of the enhanced
reactivity, selectivity and stability of Cu-Au nanoparticles in various
catalytic reactions.

Nonreciprocal charge transport is attracting much attention as a novel probe
and functionality of noncentrosymmetric superconductors. In this work, we show
that both the longitudinal and transverse nonlinear paraconductivity is hugely
enhanced in helical superconductors under moderate and high magnetic fields,
which can be observed by second-harmonic resistance measurements. The
discussion is based on the generalized formulation of nonlinear
paraconductivity in combination with the microscopically determined
Ginzburg-Landau coefficients. The enhanced nonreciprocal transport would be
observable even with the cyclotron motion of fluctuating Cooper pairs, which is
elucidated with a Kubo-type formula of nonlinear paraconductivity.
Nonreciprocal charge transport in the fluctuation regime is thereby established
as a promising probe of helical superconductivity regardless of the sample
dimensionality. Implications on the other finite-momentum superconducting
states are briefly discussed.

Long-range electronic order descending from a metallic parent state
constitutes a rich playground to study the intricate interplay of structural
and electronic degrees of freedom. With dispersive and correlation features as
multifold as topological Dirac-like itinerant states, van-Hove singularities,
correlated flat bands, and magnetic transitions at low temperature, kagome
metals are located in the most interesting regime where both phonon and
electronically mediated couplings are significant. Several of these systems
undergo a charge density wave (CDW) transition, and the van-Hove singularities,
which are intrinsic to the kagome tiling, have been conjectured to play a key
role in mediating such an instability. However, to date, the origin and the
main driving force behind this charge order is elusive. Here, we use the
topological bilayer kagome metal ScV6Sn6 as a platform to investigate this
puzzling problem, since it features both kagome-derived nested Fermi surface
and van-Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and a CDW phase that affects
the susceptibility, the neutron scattering, and the specific heat, similarly to
the siblings AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) and FeGe. We report on our findings from
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission, density functional theory, and
time-resolved optical spectroscopy to unveil the dynamics of its CDW phase. We
identify the structural degrees of freedom to play a fundamental role in the
stabilization of charge order. Along with a comprehensive analysis of the
subdominant impact from electronic correlations, we find ScV6Sn6 to feature an
instance of charge density wave order that predominantly originates from
phonons. As we shed light on the emergent phonon profile in the low-temperature
ordered regime, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of
ordering phenomena in all CDW kagome metals.

<h3>Per-grain and neighbourhood stress interactions during deformation of a  ferritic steel obtained using three-dimensional X-ray diffraction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) has been used to measure,
in-situ, the evolution of $\sim 1800$ grains in a single phase low carbon
ferritic steel sample during uniaxial deformation. The distribution of initial
residual grain stresses in the material was observed to prevail as plasticity
builds, though became less pronounced, and therefore less influential as strain
increased. The initial Schmid factor of a grain was found to be strongly
correlated to the intergranular stress change and the range of stresses that
are permissible; a grain well aligned for easy slip is more likely to exhibit a
range of stresses than those orientated poorly for dislocation motion. The
orientation path of a grain, however, is not only dependent on its initial
orientation, but hypothesised to be influenced by its stress state and the
stress state of its grain environment. A grain neighbourhood effect is
observed: the Schmid factor of serial adjoining grains influences the stress
state of a grain of interest, whereas parallel neighbours are much less
influential. This phenomenon is strongest at low plastic strains only, with the
effect diminishing as plasticity builds. The influence of initial residual
stresses becomes less evident, and grains rotate to eliminate any orientation
dependent load shedding. The ability of the BCC ferrite to exhaust such
neighbourhood interactions, which would otherwise be detrimental in crystal
structures with lower symmetric and fewer slip systems, is considered key to
the high ductility possessed by these materials.

<h3>Intergranular Hotspots: A Molecular Dynamics Study on the Influence of  Compressive and Shear Work</h3>

<br>
<br>
Numerous crystal- and microstructural-level mechanisms are at play in the
formation of hotspots, which are known to govern high explosive initiation
behavior. Most of these mechanisms, including pore collapse, interfacial
friction, and shear banding, involve both compressive and shear work done
within the material and have thus far remained difficult to separate. We assess
hotspots formed at shocked crystal-crystal interfaces using quasi-1D molecular
dynamics simulations that isolate effects due to compression and shear. Two
high explosive materials are considered (TATB and PETN) that exhibit distinctly
different levels of molecular conformational flexibility and crystal packing
anisotropy. Temperature and intra-molecular strain energy localization in the
hotspot is assessed through parametric variation of the crystal orientation and
two velocity components that respectively modulate compression and shear work.
The resulting hotspots are found to be highly localized to a region within 5-20
nm of the crystal-crystal interface. Compressive work plays a considerably
larger role in localizing temperature and intra-molecular strain energy for
both materials and all crystal orientations considered. Shear induces a
moderate increase in energy localization relative to unsheared cases only for
relatively weak compressive shock pressures of approximately 10 GPa. These
results help isolate and rank the relative importance of hotspot generation
mechanisms and are anticipated to guide the treatment of crystal-crystal
interfaces in coarse-grained models of polycrystalline high explosive
materials.

We report a study on the specific heat and heat transport of
Tb$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$Zr$_x$O$_7$ ($x =$ 0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4) single crystals
at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. The magnetic specific heat can
be described by the Schottky contribution from the crystal-electric-field (CEF)
levels of Tb$^{3+}$, with introducing Gaussian distributions of the energy
split of the ground-state doublet and the gap between the ground state and
first excited level. These crystals has an extremely low phonon thermal
conductivity in a broad temperature range that can be attributed to the
scattering by the magnetic excitations, which are mainly associated with the
CEF levels. There is strong magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity,
which is more likely related to the field-induced changes of phonon scattering
by the CEF levels than magnetic transitions or spin excitations. For magnetic
field along the [111] direction, there is large thermal Hall conductivity at
low temperatures which displays a broad peak around 8 T. At high fields up to
14 T, the thermal Hall conductivity decreases to zero, which supports its
origin from either the spinon transport or the phonon skew scattering by CEF
levels. The thermal Hall effect is rather robust with Zr doping up to 0.2 but
is strongly weakened in higher Zr-doped sample.

We propose a device where Electronic Quantum Optics (EQO) is combined with a
BCS superconductor -- a reservoir of Cooper pairs. With spin polarized wave
guides, this version of the Cooper pair beam splitter is driven by an AC drive,
and observables such as period-averaged noise are computed using a
Keldysh-Nambu-Floquet formalism. When the (low frequency) voltage applied to
the superconductor consists of a train of periodic Lorentzian pulses and the
Andreev regime is specified (large gap limit), this allows to propose an
on-demand source of non-local energy-entangled states (which we characterise
with perturbation theory) operating in the AC regime. We study realistic
experimental parameters for our device in order to examine its feasibility.

Here we report the possibility to excite ultra-short spin waves in
ferromagnetic thin-films by using time-harmonic electromagnetic fields with
terahertz frequency. Such ultra-fast excitation requires to include inertial
effects in the description of magnetization dynamics. In this respect, we
consider the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (iLLG) equation and develop
analytical theory for exchange-dominated inertial spin waves. The theory
predicts a finite limit for inertial spin wave propagation velocity, as well as
spin wave spatial decay and lifetime as function of material parameters. Then,
guided by the theory, we perform numerical micromagnetic simulations that
demonstrate the excitation of ultra-short inertial spin waves (20 nm long)
propagating at finite speed in a confined magnetic nanodot. The results are in
agreement with the theory and provide the order of magnitude of quantities
observable in realistic ultra-fast dynamics experiments.

Defects in frustrated antiferromagnetic spin chains are universally present
in geometrically frustrated systems. We consider the defects of the
one-dimensional, spin-$s$ XXZ chain with single-ion anisotropy on a periodic
chain with $N$ sites that was famously studied by Haldane. For $N$ odd the
antiferromagnetic model is frustrated, and the ground state must include a
soliton defect. We consider the Heisenberg interaction perturbatively and
determine the corresponding perturbative solitonic ground state. Then we
compute the entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy (EE), capacity of
entanglement (CE), and spin correlations in the solitonic ground state. For
weak frustration, we find an algebraic violation of the area law for the EE
consistent with recent results on weakly frustrated chains. Our analysis then
moves beyond the weak frustration regime, and we obtain a novel extensive
scaling law for the EE when strong frustration prevails, signalling large
entanglement, and failure of the quasiparticle interpretation in this regime.
Enhanced frustration results in less total correlations, but relatively more
nonlocal correlations.

Physical vapor deposition can be used to prepare highly stable organic glass
systems where the molecules show orientational and translational ordering at
the nanoscale. We have used low-dose four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy (4D STEM), enabled by a fast direct electron detector, to
map columnar order in glassy samples of a discotic mesogen using a 2 nm probe.
Both vapor deposited and liquid cooled glassy films show domains of similar
orientation, but their size varies from tens to hundreds of nanometers,
depending on processing. Domain sizes are consistent with surface diffusion
mediated ordering during film deposition. These results demonstrate the ability
of low-dose 4D STEM to characterize mesoscale structure in a molecular glass
system which may be relevant to organic electronics.

A coding scheme is introduced, allowing to store a set of linked bit strings
in planar magnetic nanoelements with holes. Analytical expressions for the
corresponding magnetization distributions are developed up to a homotopy and
the specific examples are given for doubly- and triply-connected cases. The
energy barriers, protecting the information-bearing states, are discussed.
Compared to a set of disparate simply-connected nanoelements of the same total
connectivity, the nanoelements with holes can hold much more information due to
the possibility of linking the individual bits.

Hexagonal SiGe is a promising material for combining electronic and photonic
technologies. In this work, the energetic, structural, elastic and electronic
properties of the hexagonal polytypes (2$H$, 4$H$ and 6$H$) of silicon and
germanium are thoroughly analyzed under equilibrium conditions. For this
purpose, we apply state-of-the-art density functional theory. The phase
diagram, obtained in the framework of a generalized Ising model, shows that the
diamond structure is the most stable under ambient conditions, but hexagonal
modifications are close to the phase boundary, especially for Si. Our
band-structure calculations using the MBJLDA and HSE06 exchange correlation
functionals predict significant changes in electronic states with hexagonality.
While Si crystals are always semiconductors with indirect band gaps, the
hexagonal Ge polytypes have direct band gaps. The branch point energies for Ge
crystals are below the valence band maxima, and therefore the formation of hole
gases on Ge surfaces is favoured. Band alignment based on the branch point
energy leads to type-I heterocrystalline interfaces between Ge polytypes, where
electrons and holes can be trapped in the layer with the higher hexagonality.
In contrast, the energy shift of the indirect conduction band minima of Si
polytypes is rather weak, leading to delocalization of excited electrons at
interfaces, while only holes can localize in the layer with higher
hexagonality.

<h3>Deep reinforced learning heuristic tested on spin-glass ground states:  The larger picture</h3>

In Changjun Fan et al. [Nature Communications
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep
reinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics.
In particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state
problems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in
comparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing
(SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the
reinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or
at least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of
comparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To
facilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue
two basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a
sample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a
head-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger
instances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these
studies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best
marginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to
any sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For
example, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness
exponents $\theta$ in $d>2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is
not only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state
energies and systemic errors in each of $\approx 1\%$ found here are
unacceptable. This larger picture on the method arises from a straightforward
finite-size corrections study over the spin glass ensembles the authors employ,
using data that has been available for decades.

LiV$_2$O$_4$ is a mixed-valent spinel oxide and one of a few transition-metal
compounds to host a heavy fermion phase at low temperatures. While numerous
experimental studies have attempted to elucidate how its 3$d$ electrons undergo
giant mass renormalization, spectroscopic probes that may provide crucial
hints, such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), remain to be applied. A
prerequisite is atomically flat and pristine surfaces, which, in the case of
LiV$_2$O$_4$, are difficult to obtain by cleavage of small, three-dimensional
crystals. We report the epitaxial growth of LiV$_2$O$_4$ thin films with
bulklike properties on SrTiO$_3$(111) via pulsed laser deposition and stable
STM imaging of the LiV$_2$O$_4$(111) surface. The as-grown films were
transferred $ex$ $situ$ to a room-temperature STM, where subsequent annealing
with optional sputtering in ultrahigh vacuum enabled compact islands with
smooth surfaces and a hexagonal 1$\times$1 atomic lattice to be resolved. Our
STM measurements provide insights into growth mechanisms of LiV$_2$O$_4$ on
SrTiO$_3$(111), as well as demonstrate the feasibility of performing
surface-sensitive measurements of this heavy fermion compound.

We explore the rich nature of correlations in the ground state of ultracold
atoms trapped in state-dependent optical lattices. In particular, we consider
interacting fermionic ytterbium or strontium atoms, realizing a two-orbital
Hubbard model with two spin components. We analyze the model in one-dimensional
setting with the experimentally relevant hierarchy of tunneling and interaction
amplitudes by means of exact diagonalization and matrix product states
approaches, and study the correlation functions in density, spin, and orbital
sectors as functions of variable densities of atoms in the ground and
metastable excited states. We show that in certain ranges of densities these
atomic systems demonstrate strong density-wave, ferro- and antiferromagnetic,
as well as antiferroorbital correlations.

<h3>Quantum fluctuation of ferroelectric order in polar metals</h3>

Since its discovery a decade ago, "polar metallic phase" has ignited
significant research interest, as it further functionalizes the switchable
electric polarization of materials with additional transport capability,
granting them great potential in next-generation electronic devices. The polar
metallic phase is an unusual metallic phase of matter containing long-range
ferroelectric (FE) order in the electronic and atomic structure. Distinct from
the typical FE insulating phase, this phase spontaneously breaks the inversion
symmetry but without global polarization. Unexpectedly, the FE order is found
to be dramatically suppressed by carriers and destroyed at moderate ~10%
carrier density. Here, we propose a general mechanism based on carrier-induced
quantum fluctuations to explain this puzzling phenomenon. Basically, the
quantum kinetic effect would drive the formation of polaronic quasi-particles
made of the carriers and their surrounding dipoles. The disruption in dipolar
directions can therefore weaken or even destroy the FE order. We demonstrate
such polaron formation and the associated FE suppression via a simple model
using exact diagonalization, perturbation, and quantum Monte Carlo approaches.
This quantum mechanism also provides an intuitive picture for many puzzling
experimental findings, thereby facilitating new designs of multifunctional FE
electronic devices augmented with quantum effects.
