<h3>Subdiffusive spin transport in disordered classical Heisenberg chains</h3>

We study the transport and equilibration properties of a classical Heisenberg
chain, whose couplings are random variables drawn from a one-parameter family
of power-law distributions. The absence of a scale in the couplings makes the
system deviate substantially from the usual paradigm of diffusive spin
hydrodynamics, and exhibit a regime of subdiffusive transport with an exponent
changing continuously with the parameter of the distribution. We propose a
solvable phenomenological model that correctly yields the subdiffusive
exponent, thereby linking local fluctuations in the coupling strengths to the
long-time, large-distance behaviour. It also yields the finite-time corrections
to the asymptotic scaling, which can be important in fitting the numerical
data. We show how such exponents undergo transitions as the distribution of the
coupling gets wider, marking the passage from diffusion to a regime of slow
diffusion, and finally to subdiffusion.

<h3>Superdiffusive to Ballistic Transports in Nonintegrable Rydberg Chains</h3>

A common wisdom posits that transports of conserved quantities across clean
nonintegrable quantum systems at high temperatures are diffusive when probed
from the emergent hydrodynamic regime. We show that this empirical paradigm may
alter if the strong interaction limit is taken. Using Krylov-typicality and
purification matrix-product-state methods, we establish the following
observations for the strongly interacting version of the mixed-field Ising
chain, a nonintegrable lattice model imitating the experimental Rydberg
blockade array. Given the strict projection owing to the infinite
density-density repulsion $V$, the chain's energy transport in the presence of
a transverse field $g$ is superdiffusive at infinite temperature featured by an
anomalous scaling exponent $\frac{3}{4}$, indicating the existence of a novel
dynamical universality class. Imposing, in addition, a growing longitudinal
field $h$ causes a drastic factorization of the whole Hilbert space into
smaller subsectors, evidenced by the spectral parsing of the eigenstate
entanglement. Being a consequence of this approximate symmetry, a
superdiffusion-to-ballistic transport transition arises at $h\approx g$.
Interestingly, all the above results persist for large but finite interactions
and temperatures, provided that the strongly interacting condition $g,h\ll
k_\textrm{B}T\ll V$ is fulfilled. Our predictions are verifiable by current
experimental facilities.

<h3>Differentiable graph-structured models for inverse design of lattice  materials</h3>

Materials possessing flexible physico-chemical properties that adapt
on-demand to the hostile environmental conditions of deep space will become
essential in defining the future of space exploration. A promising venue for
inspiration towards the design of environment-specific materials is in the
intricate micro-architectures and lattice geometry found throughout nature.
However, the immense design space covered by such irregular topologies is
challenging to probe analytically. For this reason, most synthetic lattice
materials have to date been based on periodic architectures instead. Here, we
propose a computational approach using a graph representation for both regular
and irregular lattice materials. Our method uses differentiable message passing
algorithms to calculate mechanical properties, and therefore allows using
automatic differentiation to adjust both the geometric structure and attributes
of individual lattice elements to design materials with desired properties. The
introduced methodology is applicable to any system representable as a
heterogeneous graph, including other types of materials.

Recent years have seen multiple high-throughput studies reveal an immense
number of topological materials through use of symmetry indicators. Despite
this success, three-dimensional topological insulators (TI) admitting a
band-gap larger than Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and two-dimensional TIs admitting a band
gap larger than $\beta$-bismuthene, two of the originally proposed TIs, remain
extremely rare. Simultaneously, a significant effort has been made to
understand and identify topological phases ``invisible" to symmetry indicators.
Such phases offer a unique opportunity to expand the search for a large
band-gap TI, however their identification requires sophisticated probes of bulk
topology. Magnetic flux tubes or vortices have emerged as one such probe in
two-dimensions when inserted into the bulk. In this work, we develop an
automated workflow to perform vortex insertion and apply it to a current
database of high-quality, experimentally realized, two-dimensional insulators.
The results reveal multiple novel two-dimensional topological insulators
supporting large bands gaps, including the 1H-MX$_{2}$ (M=Mo,W) and (X=S,Se,Te)
family of transition metal dichalcogenides. Our work has broad implications for
current theoretical and experimental efforts to employ these materials in
superconducting and Moire systems.

<h3>Coupled Ferroelectricity and Superconductivity in Bilayer $T_d$-MoTe$_2$</h3>

Achieving electrostatic control of quantum phases is at the frontier of
condensed matter research. Recent investigations have revealed
superconductivity tunable by electrostatic doping in twisted graphene
heterostructures and in two-dimensional (2D) semimetals such as WTe$_2$. Some
of these systems have a polar crystal structure that gives rise to
ferroelectricity, in which the interlayer polarization exhibits bistability
driven by external electric fields. Here we show that bilayer $T_d$-MoTe$_2$
simultaneously exhibits ferroelectric switching and superconductivity.
Remarkably, a field-driven, first-order superconductor-to-normal transition is
observed at its ferroelectric transition. Bilayer $T_d$-MoTe$_2$ also has a
maximum in its superconducting transition temperature ($T_\textrm{c}$) as a
function of carrier density and temperature, allowing independent control of
the superconducting state as a function of both doping and polarization. We
find that the maximum $T_\textrm{c}$ is concomitant with compensated electron
and hole carrier densities and vanishes when one of the Fermi pockets
disappears with doping. We argue that this unusual polarization-sensitive 2D
superconductor is driven by an interband pairing interaction associated with
nearly nested electron and hole Fermi pockets.

<h3>Accessible Chemical Space for Metal Nitride Perovskites</h3>

Building on the extensive exploration of metal oxide and metal halide
perovskites, metal nitride perovskites represent a largely unexplored class of
materials. We report a multi-tier computational screening of this chemical
space. From a pool of 3660 ABN$_3$ compositions covering I-VIII, II-VII, III-VI
and IV-V oxidation state combinations, 279 are predicted to be chemically
feasible. The ground-state structures of the 25 most promising candidate
compositions were explored through enumeration over octahedral tilt systems and
global optimisation. We predict 12 dynamically and thermodynamically stable
nitride perovskite materials, including YMoN$_3$, YWN$_3$, ZrTaN$_3$, and
LaMoN$_3$. These feature significant electric polarisation and low predicted
switching electric field, showing similarities with metal oxide perovskites and
making them attractive for ferroelectric memory devices

Electronic spins can form long-range entangled phases of condensed matter
named quantum spin liquids. Their existence is conceptualized in models of two-
or three-dimensional frustrated magnets that evade symmetry-breaking order down
to zero temperature. Quantum spin ice (QSI) is a theoretically well-established
example described by an emergent quantum electrodynamics, with excitations
behaving like photon and matter quasiparticles. The latter are fractionally
charged and equivalent to the `spinons' emerging from coherent phases of
singlets in one dimension, where clear experimental proofs of fractionalization
exist. However, in frustrated magnets it remains difficult to establish
consensual evidence for quantum spin liquid ground states and their fractional
excitations. Here, we use backscattering neutron spectroscopy to achieve
extremely high resolution of the time-dependent magnetic response of the
candidate QSI material Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. We find a gapped spectrum featuring a
threshold and peaks that match theories for pair production and propagation of
fractional matter excitations (spinons) strongly coupled to a background gauge
field. The observed peaks provide evidence for a QSI through spectroscopic
signatures of space-time symmetry fractionalization, while the threshold
behavior corroborates the regime of strong light-matter interaction predicted
for the emergent universe in a QSI.

<h3>Flocking in Binary Mixtures of Anti-aligning Self-propelled Particles</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider two species of self-propelled point particles: A-particles and
B-particles. The orientations between nearby particles are subject to pair
interactions of different strength for A-A-, A-B-(=B-A-) and B-B-interactions,
respectively. Even if all interactions involved are repelling, that is, if they
locally favor anti-alignment between each pair of particles, we find global
polar order of both A-particles and B-particles We find qualitative agreement
between agent-based simulations and mean field theory. Beyond mean field, we
develop a Boltzmann-scattering theory based on one-sided molecular chaos that
yields excellent quantitative agreement with simulations for dilute systems.
For large systems, we find, depending on parameters, either
micro-phase-separation or static patterns with either patches or stripes that
carry different polarization orientations.

<h3>Non-integrable Floquet Ising model with duality twisted boundary  conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05488" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05488</a>
<br>
<i>Aditi Mitra, Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Fei Yan, Achim Rosch</i>
<br>
<br>
Results are presented for a Floquet Ising chain with duality twisted boundary
conditions, taking into account the role of weak integrability breaking in the
form of four-fermion interactions. In the integrable case, a single isolated
Majorana zero mode exists which is a symmetry in the sense that it commutes
both with the Floquet unitary and the $Z_2$ symmetry of the Floquet unitary.
When integrability is weakly broken, both in a manner so as to preserve or
break the $Z_2$ symmetry, the Majorana zero mode is still found to be conserved
for small system sizes. This is reflected in the dynamics of an infinite
temperature autocorrelation function which, after an initial transient that is
controlled by the strength of the integrability breaking term, approaches a
plateau that does not decay with time. The height of the plateau agrees with a
numerically constructed conserved quantity, and is found to decrease with
increasing system sizes. It is argued that the existence of the plateau and its
vanishing for larger system sizes is closely related to a
localization-delocalization transition in Fock space triggered by the
integrability-breaking interactions.

<h3>Topological phase transition from periodic edge states in moiré  superlattices</h3>

<br>

Topological mosaic pattern (TMP) can be formed in two-dimensional (2D)
moir\'e superlattices, a set of periodic and spatially separated domains with
distinct topologies give rise to periodic edge states on the domain walls. In
this study, we demonstrate that these periodic edge states play a crucial role
in determining global topological properties. By developing a continuum model
for periodic edge states with C6z and C3z rotational symmetry, we predict that
a global topological phase transition at the charge neutrality point (CNP) can
be driven by the size of domain walls and moir\'e periodicity. The Wannier
representation analysis reveals that these periodic edge states are
fundamentally chiral px +- ipy orbitals. The interplay between on-site chiral
orbital rotation and neighboring hopping among chiral orbitals leads to band
inversion and a topological phase transition. Our work establishes a general
model for tuning local and global topological phases, paving the way for future
research on strongly correlated topological flat minibands within topological
mosaic patterns

<h3>Machine learning for structure-property relationships: Scalability and  limitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05502" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05502</a>
<br>
<i>Zhongzheng Tian, Sheng Zhang, Gia-Wei Chern</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework for predicting
intensive properties and particularly classifying phases of many-body systems.
Scalability and transferability are central to the unprecedented computational
efficiency of ML methods. In general, linear-scaling computation can be
achieved through the divide and conquer approach, and the locality of physical
properties is key to partitioning the system into sub-domains that can be
solved separately. Based on the locality assumption, ML model is developed for
the prediction of intensive properties of a finite-size block. Predictions of
large-scale systems can then be obtained by averaging results of the ML model
from randomly sampled blocks of the system. We show that the applicability of
this approach depends on whether the block-size of the ML model is greater than
the characteristic length scale of the system. In particular, in the case of
phase identification across a critical point, the accuracy of the ML prediction
is limited by the diverging correlation length. The two-dimensional Ising model
is used to demonstrate the proposed framework. We obtain an intriguing scaling
relation between the prediction accuracy and the ratio of ML block size over
the spin-spin correlation length. Implications for practical applications are
also discussed.

<h3>Understanding Creep in Vitrimers: Insights from Molecular Dynamics  Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05518" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05518</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Vitrimers offer a promising sustainable alternative to conventional epoxies
due to their recyclability. Vitrimers are covalent adaptive networks where some
bonds can break and reform above the vitrimer transition temperature. While
this can lead to desirable behavior such as malleability, this also leads to
undesirable rheological behavior such as low-temperature creep. In this work,
we investigate the molecular mechanisms of the creep of vitrimers using
molecular dynamics simulations. The interplay between dynamic bonding with
mechanical loading is modeled using a topology-based reaction scheme. The creep
behavior is compared against cross-linked epoxies with dynamic reactions to
understand the unique aspects related to dynamic bonding. It is found that the
free volume that arises from tensile loads is reduced in vitrimers through
dynamic bond rearrangement. An important feature that explains the difference
in secondary creep behavior between conventional epoxies and vitrimers is the
orientation of the dynamic bonds during loading. In vitrimers, the dynamic
bonds preferentially align orthogonal to the loading axis, decreasing the axial
stiffness during secondary creep, resulting in larger creep strain compared to
epoxies. Over longer timescales, such increased strain leads to void growth,
resulting in tertiary creep. Thus, chemistry changes or additives that can
prevent the initial realignment of dynamic bonds, and therefore subsequent void
growth, can be an effective strategy to mitigate creep in vitrimers.

<h3>Surface Passivation Suppresses Local Ion Motion in Halide Perovskites</h3>

<br>
We use scanning probe microscopy to study ion migration in the formamidinium
(FA)-containing halide perovskite semiconductor
$Cs_{0.22}FA_{0.78}Pb(I_{0.85}Br_{0.15})_3$ in the presence and absence of
chemical surface passivation. We measure the evolving contact potential
difference (CPD) using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) following
voltage poling. We find that ion migration leads to a ~100 mV shift in the CPD
of control films after poling with 3V for only a few seconds. Moreover, we find
that ion migration is heterogeneous, with domain interfaces leading to a larger
shift in the CPD. Application of (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) as a
surface passivator further leads to 5-fold reduction in the CPD shift from ~100
meV to ~20 meV. We use hyperspectral microscopy to show that APTMS-treated
perovskite films undergo less photoinduced halide migration than control films.
We interpret these results as due to a reduction in halide vacancy
concentration due to passivation with APTMS.

<h3>Inducing Quantum Phase Transitions in Non-Topological Insulators Via  Atomic Control of Sub-Structural Elements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05549</a>

<br>
<br>
Topological insulators (TIs) are an important family of quantum materials
that exhibit a Dirac point (DP) in the surface band structure but have a finite
band gap in bulk. A large degree of spin-orbit interaction and low bandgap is a
prerequisite for stabilizing DPs on selective atomically flat cleavage planes.
Tuning of the DP in these materials has been suggested via modifications to the
atomic structure of the entire system. Using the example of As$_2$Te$_3$ and
ZnTe$_5$, which are not TIs, we show that a quantum phase transition can be
induced in atomically flat and stepped surfaces, for As$_2$Te$_3$ and ZrTe$_5$,
respectively. This is achieved by establishing a framework for controlling
electronic properties that is focused on local perturbations at key locations
that we call sub-structural elements (SSEs). We exemplify this framework
through a novel method of isovalent sublayer anion doping and biaxial strain.

<h3>On the mystery of ultrastable super-Tonks-Girardeau gases under weak  dipolar interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05555" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05555</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Chen, Xiaoling Cui</i>
<br>
<br>
The highly excited super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas was recently observed to
be extremely stable in the presence of a weak dipolar repulsion. Here we reveal
the underlying reason for this mysterious phenomenon. By exactly solving the
trapped small clusters with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that
the reason lies in the distinct spectral responses between sTG gas and its
decaying channel (bound state) when turn on a weak dipolar interaction.
Specifically, a tiny dipolar force can produce a visible energy shift for the
localized bound state, but can hardly affect the extended sTG branch. As a
result, the avoided level crossing between two branches is greatly modified in
both location and width in the parameter axis of coupling strength, leading to
a more (less) stable sTG gas for a repulsive (attractive) dipolar force. These
results, consistent with experimental observations, are found to robustly apply
to both bosonic and fermionic systems.

<h3>Chiral photonic crystals from sphere packing</h3>

<br>
<i>Tao Liu, Ho-Kei Chan, Duanduan Wan</i>
<br>
<br>
Inspired by recent developments in self-assembled chiral nanostructures, we
have explored the possibility of using spherical particles packed in cylinders
as building blocks for chiral photonic crystals. In particular, we focused on
an array of parallel cylinders arranged in a perfect triangular lattice, each
containing an identical densest sphere packing structure. Despite the
non-chirality of both the spheres and cylinders, the self-assembled system can
exhibit chirality due to spontaneous symmetry breaking during the assembly
process. We have investigated the circular dichroism effects of the system and
have found that, for both perfect electric conductor and dielectric spheres,
the system can display dual-polarization photonic band gaps for circularly
polarized light at normal incidence along the axis of the helix. Further, we
have examined how the polarization band gap size depends on the dielectric
constant of the spheres and the packing fraction of the cylinders. Our findings
suggest that a cluster formed by spheres self-assembling inside parallel
cylinders with appropriate material parameters could be a promising approach to
creating chiral photonic crystals.

<br>
Motivated by the experimental synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite
materials, we study the stability of 2D SrTiO$_3$ from first principles. We
find that the TiO$_6$ octahedral rotations emerge in 2D SrTiO$_3$ with a
rotation angle twice that in the 3D bulk. The rotation angle decreases
significantly with the film thickness, reflecting the strong interlayer
coupling that is absent in the conventional 2D materials. Using the molecular
dynamics simulations, the cubic-like phase is found to appear above 1000 K that
is much higher than the transition temperature of 3D SrTiO$_3$.

<h3>Giant spin-valve effect and chiral anomaly in antiferromagnetic  topological insulators Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4</h3>

<i>Seng Huat Lee, David Graf, Robert Robinson, John Singleton, Johanna C. Palmstrom, Zhiqiang Mao</i>
<br>
<br>
We report c-axis transport studies on magnetic topological insulators
Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4. We performed systematic c-axis magnetoresistivity
measurements under high magnetic fields (up to 35 T) on several representative
samples. We find the lightly hole- and lightly electron-doped samples, while
both having the same order of magnitude of carrier density and similar
spin-flop transitions, exhibit sharp contrast in electronic anisotropy and
transport mechanism. The electronic anisotropy is remarkably enhanced for the
lightly hole-doped sample relative to pristine MnBi2Te4 but not for the lightly
electron-doped sample. The lightly electron-doped sample displays a giant
negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity (LMR) induced by the spin-valve effect
at the spin-flop transition field, whereas the lightly hole-doped sample
exhibits remarkable negative LMR consistent with the chiral anomaly behavior of
a Weyl semimetal. Furthermore, we find the large negative LMR of the lightly
hole-doped sample extends to a wide temperature range above the N\'eel
temperature (T_N) where the magnetoconductivity is proportional to B^2. This
fact, together with the short-range intralayer ferromagnetic correlation
revealed in isothermal magnetization measurements, suggests the possible
presence of the Weyl state above T_N. These results demonstrate that in the
c-axis magnetotransport of Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4, the spin scattering is dominant in
the lightly electron-doped sample but overwhelmed by the chiral anomaly effect
in the lightly hole-doped sample due to the presence of the Weyl state. These
findings extend the understanding of the transport properties of
Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4.

The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law relates the electronic component of the thermal
conductivity to the electrical conductivity in metals through the Lorenz
number. The WF law has proven to be remarkably robust, however violations have
been observed in many topological materials. In this work, we report
thermoelectric measurements conducted on Heusler, ferromagnetic, Weyl semimetal
Co$_2$MnAl which shows a drastic, temperature dependent violation of the WF law
below 300 K. We then discuss our result in the context of known physical
explanations for WF law violation. Both the magnitude and temperature
dependence of the violation in Co2MnAl are extreme, indicating that there may
be more than one effect contributing to the violation in this system.

<h3>A Continuum Model for Dislocation Climb</h3>

Dislocation climb plays an important role in understanding plastic
deformation of metallic materials at high temperature. In this paper, we
present a continuum formulation for dislocation climb velocity based on
densities of dislocations. The obtained continuum formulation is an accurate
approximation of the Green's function based discrete dislocation dynamics
method (Gu et al. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 83:319-337, 2015). The continuum
dislocation climb formulation has the advantage of accounting for both the
long-range effect of vacancy bulk diffusion and that of the Peach-Koehler climb
force, and the two longrange effects are canceled into a short-range effect
(integral with fast-decaying kernel) and in some special cases, a completely
local effect. This significantly simplifies the calculation in the Green's
function based discrete dislocation dynamics method, in which a linear system
has to be solved over the entire system for the long-range effect of vacancy
diffusion and the long-range Peach-Koehler climb force has to be calculated.
This obtained continuum dislocation climb velocity can be applied in any
available continuum dislocation dynamics frameworks. We also present numerical
validations for this continuum climb velocity and simulation examples for
implementation in continuum dislocation dynamics frameworks.

Point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates as
single-photon emitters (SPEs) in nanophotonics and quantum information
applications. The precise control of SPEs requires in-depth understanding of
their optoelectronic properties. However, how the surrounding environment of
host materials, including number of layers, substrates, and strain, influences
SPEs has not been fully understood. In this work, we study the dielectric
screening effect due to the number of layers and substrates, and the strain
effect on the optical properties of carbon dimer and nitrogen vacancy defects
in hBN from first-principles many-body perturbation theory. We report that the
environmental screening causes lowering of the GW gap and exciton binding
energy, leading to nearly constant optical excitation energy and exciton
radiative lifetime. We explain the results with an analytical model starting
from the BSE Hamiltonian with Wannier basis. We also show that optical
properties of quantum defects are largely tunable by strain with highly
anisotropic response, in good agreement with experimental measurements. Our
work clarifies the effect of environmental screening and strain on
optoelectronic properties of quantum defects in two-dimensional insulators,
facilitating future applications of SPEs and spin qubits in low-dimensional
systems.

<h3>Emergent helicity in free-standing semiflexible, charged polymers</h3>

Helical motifs are ubiquitious in macromolecular systems. The mechanism of
spontaneous emergence of helicity is unknown, especially in cases where
torsional interactions are absent. Emergence of helical order needs coordinated
organization over long distances in polymeric macromolecules. We establish a
very generic mechanism to obtain spontaneous helicity by inducing screened
Coulomb interactions between monomers in a semiflexible heteropolymer. Due to
changes in solvent conditions, different segments (monomers) of a polymeric
chain can get locally charged with charges of differing polarities and
magnitudes along the chain contour. This in turn leads to spontaneous emergence
of transient helical structures along the chain contour for a wide range of
Debye-lengths. We have avoided using torsional potentials to obtain helical
structures and rely only on radially symmetric interactions. Lastly, transient
helices can be made long-lived when they are subjected to geometric
confinement, which can emerge in experimental realizations through a variety of
conditions.

<h3>Janus monolayer TaNF: a new ferrovalley material with large valley  splitting and tunable magnetic properties</h3>

<br>
<i>Guibo Zheng, Shuixian Qu, Wenzhe Zhou, Fangping Ouyang</i>
<br>
<br>
Materials with large intrinsic valley splitting and high Curie temperature
are a huge advantage for studying valleytronics and practical applications. In
this work, using first-principles calculations, a new Janus TaNF monolayer is
predicted to exhibit excellent piezoelectric properties and intrinsic valley
splitting, resulting from the spontaneous spin polarization, the spatial
inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). TaNF is also
a potential two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material due to its high Curie
temperature and huge magnetic anisotropy energy. The effective control of the
band gap of TaNF can be achieved by biaxial strain, which can transform TaNF
monolayer from semiconductor to semi-metal. The magnitude of valley splitting
at the CBM can be effectively tuned by biaxial strain due to the changes of
orbital composition at the valleys. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) can be
manipulated by changing the energy and occupation (unoccupation) states of d
orbital compositions through biaxial strain. In addition, Curie temperature
reaches 373 K under only -3% biaxial strain, indicating that Janus TaNF
monolayer can be used at high temperatures for spintronic and valleytronic
devices.

<br>
<br>
Numerical simulations of the full quantum properties of interacting many-body
systems by means of field-theoretic Monte-Carlo techniques are often limited
due to a sign problem. Here we simulate properties of a dilute two-dimensional
Bose gas in the vicinity of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition by means of the Complex Langevin (CL) algorithm, thereby extending
our previous CL study of the three-dimensional Bose gas to the
lower-dimensional case. The purpose of the paper is twofold. On the one hand,
it adds to benchmarking of the CL method and thus contributes to further
exploring the range of applicability of the method. With the respective
results, the universality of the equation of state is recovered, as well as the
long-wave-length power-law dependence of the single-particle momentum spectrum
below the BKT transition. Analysis of the rotational part of the current
density corroborates vortex unbinding in crossing the transition. Beyond these
measures of consistency we compute quantum corrections to the critical density
and chemical potential in the weakly coupled regime. Our results show a shift
of these quantities to lower values as compared to those obtained from
classical field theory. It points in the opposite direction as compared to the
shift of the critical density found by means of the path-integral Monte-Carlo
method at larger values of the coupling. Our simulations widen the perspective
for precision comparisons with experiment.

Understanding the microstuctural evolution during the sintering process is of
high relevance as it is a key part in many industrial manufacturing processes.
Simulations are one avenue to achieve this understanding, especially
field-resolved methods such as the phase-field method. Recent papers have shown
several weaknesses in the most common phase-field model of sintering, which the
present paper aims to ameliorate. The observed weaknesses are shortly
recounted, followed by presenting model variations aiming to remove these
deficiencies. The models are tested in the classical two-particle geometry,
with the most promising model being run on large-scale three-dimensional
packings to determine representative volume elements. A densification that is
strongly dependent on the packing size is observed, which suggests that the
model requires further improvement.

We study $Z_2$ lattice gauge-Higgs model in (2+1)-dimensions with specific
open boundary conditions. Suitable order parameters are supplied by the
boundary conditions, which distinguish the Higgs and confinement phases, and
they are conjugate with each other. One-form symmetries given by Wilson and 't
Hooft loops, as well as duality of the model, play an important role for the
identification of the phase structure. Gauss-law constraints are regarded as
stabilizers inherent subsystem codes. The order parameters are nothing but
logical operators in subsystem codes, and mixed anomaly of them dictates the
existence of boundary zero modes and the degeneracy of states even in very
high-energy levels. Subsystem codes are embedded in the Higgs and confinement
phases. In addition to general argument on the subsystem code, we give concrete
description of the code (encoded qubit) in the Higgs and confinement phases,
which are dual with each other. Numerical methods are used to corroborate
analytically-obtained results. The present work reveals that the confinement
phase is a symmetry-protected-topological phase as the Higgs phase.

MnSb$_{2}$O$_{6}$ is based on the noncentrosymmetric $P321$ space group with
magnetic Mn$^{2+}$ ($S={5/2}$, $L\approx 0$) spins ordering below
$T_{\mathrm{N}}=12$ K in a helicoidal structure. The ground state magnetic
structure, expected to be built and originate from 7 Heisenberg exchange
constants, has been shown to be coupled to the underlying crystallographic
chirality with polar domain switching being reported. We apply neutron
spectroscopy to extract these symmetric exchange constants. Given the high
complexity of the magnetic exchange network, crystallographic structure and
complications fitting linear spin-wave models, we take advantage of multiplexed
neutron instrumentation to use the first moment sum rule of neutron scattering
to estimate the 7 exchange constants. We then use these parameters to calculate
the low-energy spin-waves in the N\'eel state to reproduce the neutron response
without strong antisymmetric coupling. Using Green's response functions, the
stability of long-wavelength excitations in the context of proposed magnetic
structures is then discussed. The results show the presence of strong exchange
constants for the chiral exchange pathways and illustrate an underlying
coupling between crystallographic and magnetic ``chirality" through
predominantely symmetric exchange.

We show theoretically and experimentally the existence of topological
monomodes in non-Hermitian systems created by loss engineering. This challenges
the idea that edge states always come in pairs in $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry-protected topological systems. We theoretically show the existence of
a monomode in a non-Hermitian 1D and 2D SSH models. Furthermore, we classify
the systems in terms of the (non-Hermitian) symmetries that are present and
calculate the corresponding topological invariant. To corroborate the theory,
we present experiments in photonic lattices in which a monomode is observed in
a non-Hermitian 1D SSH chain.

<h3>Exploring the Interfacial Coupling between Graphene and  Antiferromagnetic Insulator MnPSe$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Interfacial coupling between graphene and other 2D materials can give rise to
intriguing physical phenomena. In particular, several theoretical studies
predict that the interplay between graphene and an antiferromagnetic insulator
could lead to the emergence of quantum anomalous Hall phases. However, such
phases have not been observed experimentally yet, and further experimental
studies are needed to reveal the interaction between graphene and
antiferromagnetic insulators. Here, we report the study in heterostructures
composed of graphene and the antiferromagnetic insulator MnPSe$_3$. It is found
that the MnPSe$_3$ has little impact on the quantum Hall phases apart from
doping graphene via interfacial charge transfer. However, the magnetic order
can contribute indirectly via process like Kondo effect, as evidenced by the
observed minimum in the temperature-resistance curve between 20-40 K, far below
the N\'eel temperature (70 K).

<h3>Evidence of magnetoelectronic electromagnon mediated transport in  flexoelectronic heterostructures</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The superposition of atomic vibrations and flexoelectronic effect gives rise
to a cross correlation between free charge carriers and temporal magnetic
moment of phonons in conducting heterostructures under an applied strain
gradient. The resulting dynamical coupling is expected to give rise to
quasiparticle excitations called as magnetoelectronic electromagnon that
carries electronic charge and temporal magnetic moment. Here, we report
experimental evidence of magnetoelectronic electromagnon in the freestanding
degenerately doped p-Si based heterostructure thin film samples. These
quasiparticle excitations give rise to long-distance (>100um) spin transport;
demonstrated using spatially modulated transverse magneto-thermoelectric and
non-local resistance measurements. The magnetoelectronic electromagnons are
non-reciprocal and give rise to large magnetochiral anisotropy (0.352 A-1T-1)
that diminishes at lower temperatures. The superposition of non-reciprocal
magnetoelectronic electromagnons gives rise to longitudinal and transverse
modulations in charge carrier density, spin density and magnetic moment;
demonstrated using the Hall effect and edge dependent magnetoresistance
measurements, which can also be called as inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic
multiferroic effect. These quasiparticle excitations are analogues to photons
where time dependent polarization and temporal magnetic moment replaces
electric and magnetic field, respectively and most likely topological because
it manifests topological Nernst effect. Hence, the magnetoelectronic
electromagnon can potentially give rise to quantum interference and
entanglement effects in conducting solid state system at room temperature in
addition to efficient spin transport.

One-dimensional all-bands-flat lattices are networks with all bands being
flat and highly degenerate. They can always be diagonalized by a finite
sequence of local unitary transformations parameterized by a set of angles
\(\theta_{i}\). In our previous work, Ref.~\onlinecite{lee2023critical}, we
demonstrated that quasiperiodic perturbations of the one-dimensional
all-bands-flat lattice with \(\theta_{i} = \pi/4\) give rise to a
critical-to-insulator transition and fractality edges separating critical from
localized states. In this study we consider the full range of angles
\(\theta_{i}\)s available for the all-bands-flat model and study the effect of
the quasiperiodic perturbation. For weak perturbation, we derive an effective
Hamiltonian and we identify the sets of \(\theta_{i}\)s for which the effective
model maps to extended or off-diagonal Harper models and hosts critical states.
For all the other values of the angles the spectrum is localized. Upon
increasing the perturbation strength, the extended Harper model evolves into
the system with energy dependent critical-to-insulator transitions, that we dub
\emph{fractality edges}. The case where the effective model maps onto the
off-diagonal Harper model features a critical-to-insulator transition at a
finite disorder strength.

X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has become a reliable metrology tool for
measuring internal flaws and other microstructural features in engineering
materials. However, tracking of material points to measure three-dimensional
(3D) deformations has hitherto relied on either artificially adding tracer
particles (speckles) or exploiting inherent microstructural features such as
inclusions. This has greatly limited the spatial resolution and magnitude of
the deformation measurements. Here we report a novel Flux Enhanced Tomography
for Correlation (FETC) technique that leverages the inherent inhomogeneities
within nominally homogeneous engineering polymers to track 3D material point
displacements without recourse to artificial speckles or microstructural
features such as inclusions. The FETC is then combined with a
Eulerian/Lagrangian transformation in a multi-step Digital Volume Correlation
(DVC) methodology to measure all nine components of the deformation gradient
within the volume of complex specimens undergoing extreme deformations. FETC is
a powerful technique that greatly expands the capabilities of laboratory-based
XCT to provide amongst other things the inputs required for data-driven
constitutive modelling approaches.

Studying protein interactions at low temperatures has important implications
for optimizing cryostorage processes of biological tissue, food, and
protein-based drugs. One of the major challenges is related to the formation of
ice nanocrystals which can occur even in the presence of cryoprotectants and
can lead to protein denaturation. Here, using a combination of small- and
wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), we investigate the structural
evolution of concentrated Lysozyme solutions in a cryoprotected glycerol-water
mixture upon cooling from room temperature (T=300 K) down to cryogenic
temperatures (T=195 K). Upon cooling, we observe a transition near the melting
temperature of the solution (T~245 K), which manifests both in the temperature
dependence of the scattering intensity peak position reflecting protein-protein
length scales (SAXS) and the interatomic distances within the solvent (WAXS).
Upon thermal cycling, a hysteresis is observed in the scattering intensity,
which is attributed to the formation of nanocrystallites in the order of 10 nm.
The experimental data is well described by the two-Yukawa model, which
indicates temperature-dependent changes in the short-range attraction of the
protein-protein interaction potential. Our results demonstrate that the
nanocrystal growth yields effectively stronger protein-protein attraction and
influences the protein pair distribution function beyond the first coordination
shell.

Magnetic droplets are nanoscale, non-topological, magnetodynamical solitons
that can be nucleated in spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) or spin Hall
nano-oscillators (SHNOs). All theoretical, numerical, and experimental droplet
studies have so far focused on the free layer (FL), and any additional dynamics
in the reference layer (RL) have been entirely ignored. Here we show, using
all-perpendicular STNOs, that there is not only significant magnetodynamics in
the RL, but the reference layer itself can host a droplet coexisting with the
FL droplet. Both droplets are observed experimentally as stepwise changes and
sharp peaks in the dc and differential resistance, respectively. Whereas the
single FL droplet is highly stable, the coexistence state exhibits high-power
broadband microwave noise. Micromagnetic simulations corroborate the
experimental results and reveal a strong interaction between the droplets. Our
demonstration of strongly interacting and closely spaced droplets offers a
unique platform for fundamental studies of highly non-linear soliton pair
dynamics.

The transport properties, resistance, Hall effect, and low T
magnetoresistance for very oxygen overdoped nonsuperconducting Bi2Sr2CuO6+d
(Bi2201) thin films are reported. From 20 to 300K, the temperature dependence
of the resistance is well described by a law of the form a+bT4/3, theoretically
predicted to occur in the presence of ferromagnetic fluctuations. In addition,
this prediction is reinforced by the analysis of the transverse and the
longitudinal low T magnetoresistance. Interestingly, the presence of a weak
disorder causing low T electronic localization allows us to evidence very short
diffusion lengths, as observed in other systems with ferromagnetic
fluctuations.

<br>
<br>
Intertwined spin and charge orders have been widely studied in
high-temperature superconductors, since their fluctuations may facilitate
electron pairing; however, they are rarely identified in heavily electron-doped
iron selenides. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that when
the superconductivity of (Li0.84Fe0.16OH)Fe1-xSe is suppressed by introducing
Fe-site defects, a short-ranged checkerboard charge order emerges, propagating
along the Fe-Fe directions with an approximately 2aFe period. It persists
throughout the whole phase space tuned by Fe-site defect density, from a
defect-pinned local pattern in optimally doped samples to an extended order in
samples with lower Tc or non-superconducting. Intriguingly, our simulations
indicate that the charge order is likely driven by multiple-Q spin density
waves originating from the spin fluctuations observed by inelastic neutron
scattering. Our study proves the presence of a competing order in heavily
electron-doped iron selenides, and demonstrates the potential of charge order
as a tool to detect spin fluctuations.

This work explores the possibility of creating and controlling unconventional
nonlinearities by periodic driving, in a broad class of systems described by
the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). By means of a parent quantum
many-body description, we demonstrate that such driven systems are well
captured by an effective NLSE with emergent nonlinearities, which can be finely
controlled by tuning the driving sequence. We first consider a general class of
two-mode nonlinear systems - relevant to optical Kerr cavities, waveguides and
Bose-Einstein condensates - where we find an emergent four-wave mixing
nonlinearity, which originates from pair-hopping processes in the parent
quantum picture. Tuning this drive-induced nonlinearity is shown to modify the
phase-space topology, which can be detected through relative population and
phase measurements. We then couple individual (two-mode) dimers in view of
designing extended lattice models with unconventional nonlinearities and
controllable pair-hopping processes. Following this general dimerization
construction, we obtain an effective lattice model with drive-induced
interactions, whose ground-state exhibits orbital order, chiral currents and
emergent magnetic fluxes through the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal
symmetry. We analyze these intriguing properties both in the weakly-interacting
(mean-field) regime, captured by the effective NLSE, and in the
strongly-correlated quantum regime. Our general approach opens a route for the
engineering of unconventional optical nonlinearities in photonic devices and
controllable drive-induced interactions in ultracold quantum matter.

The lack of p-type doping has impeded the development of vertical gallium
oxide (Ga2O3) devices. Current blocking layers (CBL) using implanted deep
acceptors has been used to demonstrate vertical devices. This paper presents
the first demonstration of in situ Mg-doped beta-Ga2O3 CBLs grown using
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Device structures were designed with
in-situ Mg doped layers with varied targeted Mg doping concentrations, which
were calibrated by quantitative secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). The
effectiveness of the CBL is characterized using temperature dependent
current-voltage measurements using n-Mg-doped-n structures, providing crucial
insight into the underlying mechanisms. To further validate the experimental
results, a TCAD simulation is performed and the electrically active effective
doping is found to be dependent on the Mg-doping density, offering a new
perspective on the optimization of CBL performance. Breakdown measurements show
a 3.4 MV/cm field strength. This study represents a significant step forward in
the development of Ga2O3-based devices and paves the way for future
advancements in this exciting field.

<br>
The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which is the antisymmetric part
of the exchange interaction between neighboring local spins, winds the spin
manifold and can stabilize non-trivial topological spin textures. Since
topology is a robust information carrier, characterization techniques that can
extract the DMI magnitude are important for the discovery and optimization of
spintronic materials. Existing experimental techniques for quantitative
determination of DMI, such as high-resolution magnetic imaging of spin textures
and measurement of magnon or transport properties, are time consuming and
require specialized instrumentation. Here we show that a convolutional neural
network can extract the DMI magnitude from minor hysteresis loops, or magnetic
`fingerprints', of a material. These hysteresis loops are readily available by
conventional magnetometry measurements. This provides a convenient tool to
investigate topological spin textures for next-generation information
processing.

With the slowing down of Moore's law, augmenting complementary-metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) transistors with emerging nanotechnologies (X) is becoming
increasingly important. In this paper, we demonstrate how stochastic magnetic
tunnel junction (sMTJ)-based probabilistic bits, or p-bits, can be combined
with versatile Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to design an
energy-efficient, heterogeneous CMOS + X (X = sMTJ) prototype. Our
heterogeneous computer successfully performs probabilistic inference and
asynchronous Boltzmann learning despite device-to-device variations in sMTJs. A
comprehensive comparison using a CMOS predictive process design kit (PDK)
reveals that digital CMOS-based p-bits emulating high-quality randomness use
over 10,000 transistors with the energy per generated random number being
roughly two orders of magnitude greater than the sMTJ-based p-bits that
dissipate only 2 fJ. Scaled and integrated versions of our approach can
significantly advance probabilistic computing and its applications in various
domains, including probabilistic machine learning, optimization, and quantum
simulation.

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors possess strongly bound excitons, opening
novel opportunities for engineering light-matter interaction at the nanoscale.
However, their in-plane confinement leads to large non-radiative
exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) processes, setting a fundamental limit for
their photonic applications. In this work, we demonstrate suppression of EEA
via enhancement of light-matter interaction in hybrid 2D
semiconductor-dielectric nanophotonic platforms, by coupling excitons in WS$ _2
$ monolayers with optical Mie resonances in dielectric nanoantennas. The hybrid
system reaches an intermediate light-matter coupling regime, with
photoluminescence enhancement factors up to 10$ ^2 $. Probing the exciton
ultrafast dynamics reveal suppressed EEA for coupled excitons, even under high
exciton densities $>$ 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2} $. We extract EEA coefficients in the
order of 10$^{-3} $, compared to 10$^{-2} $ for uncoupled monolayers, as well
as absorption enhancement of 3.9 and a Purcell factor of 4.5. Our results
highlight engineering the photonic environment as a route to achieve higher
quantum efficiencies for low-power hybrid devices, and larger exciton
densities, towards strongly correlated excitonic phases in 2D semiconductors.

We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-GeTe and In-GeTe-In
proximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium
leads and thick single crystal flakes of $\alpha$-GeTe topological semimetal.
We observe nonmonotonic effects of the applied external magnetic field,
including reentrant superconductivity in In-GeTe-In Josephson junctions:
supercurrent reappears at some finite magnetic field. For a single In-GeTe
Andreev junction, the superconducting gap is partially suppressed in zero
magnetic field, while the gap is increased nearly to the bulk value for some
finite field before its full suppression. We discuss possible reasons for the
results obtained, taking into account spin polarization of Fermi arc surface
states in topological semimetal $\alpha$-GeTe with a strong spin-orbit
coupling. In particular, the zero-field surface state spin polarization
partially suppresses the superconductivity, while it is recovered due to the
modified spin-split surface state configuration in finite fields. As an
alternative possible scenario, the transition into the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is discussed. However, the role of
strong spin-orbit coupling in forming the nonmonotonic behavior has not been
analyzed for heterostructures in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state,
which is crucial for junctions involving GeTe topological semimetal.

We consider a Josephson bijunction consisting of three superconducting
reservoirs connected through two quantum dots. In equilibrium, the interdot
coupling is sizable only for distances smaller than the superconducting
coherence length. Application of commensurate dc voltages results in a
time-periodic Hamiltonian and induces an interdot coupling at large distances.
The basic mechanism of this long-range coupling is shown to be due to local
multiple Andreev reflections on each dot, followed by quasiparticle propagation
at energies larger than the superconducting gap. At large interdot distances we
derive an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing two resonances coupled
through a continuum.

Shortcut engineering consists of a class of approaches to rapidly manipulate
physical systems by means of specially designed external controls. In this
Letter, we apply these approaches to run-and-tumble particles, which are
designed to mimic the chemotactic behavior of bacteria and therefore exhibit
complex dynamics due to their self-propulsion and random reorientation, making
them difficult to control. Following a recent successful application to active
Brownian particles, we find a general solution for the rapid control of 1D
run-and-tumble particles in a harmonic potential. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using numerical simulations and show that it can
lead to a significant speedup compared to simple quenched protocols. Our
results extend shortcut engineering to a wider class of active systems and
demonstrate that it is a promising tool for controlling the dynamics of active
matter, which has implications for a wide range of applications in fields such
as materials science and biophysics.

Microscopically understanding and classifying phases of matter is at the
heart of strongly-correlated quantum physics. With quantum simulations, genuine
projective measurements (snapshots) of the many-body state can be taken, which
include the full information of correlations in the system. The rise of deep
neural networks has made it possible to routinely solve abstract processing and
classification tasks of large datasets, which can act as a guiding hand for
quantum data analysis. However, though proven to be successful in
differentiating between different phases of matter, conventional neural
networks mostly lack interpretability on a physical footing. Here, we combine
confusion learning with correlation convolutional neural networks, which yields
fully interpretable phase detection in terms of correlation functions. In
particular, we study thermodynamic properties of the 2D Heisenberg model,
whereby the trained network is shown to pick up qualitative changes in the
snapshots above and below a characteristic temperature where magnetic
correlations become significantly long-range. We identify the full counting
statistics of nearest neighbor spin correlations as the most important quantity
for the decision process of the neural network, which go beyond averages of
local observables. With access to the fluctuations of second-order correlations
-- which indirectly include contributions from higher order, long-range
correlations -- the network is able to detect changes of the specific heat and
spin susceptibility, the latter being in analogy to magnetic properties of the
pseudogap phase in high-temperature superconductors. By combining the confusion
learning scheme with transformer neural networks, our work opens new directions
in interpretable quantum image processing being sensible to long-range order.
