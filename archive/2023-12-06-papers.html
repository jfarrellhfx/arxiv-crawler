<h3>The influence of frequency and gravity on the orientation of active  metallo-dielecric Janus particles translating under a uniform applied  alternating-current electric field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03099</a>
<br>
<i>Alicia Boymelgreen, Golak Kunti, Pablo Garcia Sanchez, Gilad Yossifone</i>
<p>Theoretical and numerical models of active Janus particles commonly assume
that the metallo-dielectric interface is parallel to the driving applied
electric field. However, our experimental observations indicate that the
equilibrium angle of orientation of electrokinetically driven Janus particles
varies as a function of the frequency and voltage of the applied electric
field. Here, we quantify the variation of the orientation with respect to the
electric field and demonstrate that the equilibrium position represents the
interplay between gravitational, electrostatic and electrohydrodynamic torques.
The latter two categories are functions of the applied field (frequency,
voltage) as well as the height of the particle above the substrate. Maximum
departure from the alignment with the electric field occurs at low frequencies
characteristic of induced-charge electrophoresis and at low voltages where
gravity dominates the electrostatic and electrohydrodynamic torques. The
departure of the interface from alignment with the electric field is shown to
decrease particle mobility through comparison of freely suspended Janus
particles subject only to electrical forcing and magnetized Janus particles in
which magnetic torque is used to align the interface with the electric field.
Consideration of the role of gravitational torque and particle-wall
interactions could account for some discrepancies between theory, numerics and
experiment in active matter systems.

<h3>Flux ratios for effects of permanent charges on ionic flows with three  ion species: Case study (II)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02987" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02987</a>
<br>
<i>Ning Sun, Weishi Liu</i>
<p>In this paper, we study effects of permanent charges on ion flows through
membrane channels via a quasi-one-dimensional classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck
system. This system includes three ion species, two cations with different
valences and one anion, and permanent charges with a simple structure, zeros at
the two end regions and a constant over the middle region. For small permanent
charges, our main goal is to analyze the effects of permanent charges on ionic
flows, interacting with the boundary conditions and channel structure.
Continuing from a previous work, we investigate the problem for a new case
toward a more comprehensive understanding about effects of permanent charges on
ionic fluxes.

<h3>Morphological Control of Bundled Actin Networks Subject to Fixed-Mass  Depletion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02989" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02989</a>

<i>James Clarke, Lauren Melcher, Anne D. Crowell, Francis Cavanna, Justin R. Houser, Kristin Graham, Allison Green, Jeanne C. Stachowiak, Thomas M. Truskett, Delia J. Milliron, Adrianne M. Rosales, Moumita Das, José Alvarado</i>
<p>Depletion interactions are thought to significantly contribute to the
organization of intracellular structures in the crowded cytosol. The strength
of depletion interactions depends on physical parameters like the depletant
number density and the depletant size ratio. Cells are known to dynamically
regulate these two parameters by varying the copy number of proteins of a wide
distribution of sizes. However, mammalian cells are also known to keep the
total protein mass density remarkably constant, to within 0.5% throughout the
cell cycle. We thus ask how the strength of depletion interactions varies when
the total depletant mass is held fixed, a.k.a. fixed-mass depletion. We answer
this question via scaling arguments, as well as by studying depletion effects
on networks of reconstituted semiflexible actin $\textit{in silico}$ and
$\textit{in vitro}$. We examine the maximum strength of the depletion
interaction potential $U^*$ as a function of $q$, the size ratio between the
depletant and the matter being depleted. We uncover a scaling relation $U^*
\sim q^{-\zeta}$ for two cases: fixed volume fraction $\phi$ and fixed mass
density $\rho$. For fixed volume fraction, we report $\zeta < 0$. For the fixed
mass density case, we report $\zeta > 0$, which suggests the depletion
interaction strength increases as the depletant size ratio is increased. To
test this prediction, we prepared our filament networks at fixed mass
concentrations with varying sizes of the depletant molecule poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG). We characterize the depletion interaction strength in our
simulations via the mesh size. In experiments, we observe two distinct actin
network morphologies, which we call weakly bundled and strongly bundled. We
identify a mass concentration where different PEG depletant sizes leads to
weakly bundled or strongly bundled morphologies...[more in main text].

<h3>TTCF4LAMMPS: A toolkit for simulation of the non-equilibrium behaviour  of molecular fluids at experimentally accessible shear rates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02990" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02990</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Maffioli, James P. Ewen, Edward R. Smith, Sleeba Varghese, Peter J. Daivis, Daniele Dini, B. D. Todd</i>
<p>We present TTCF4LAMMPS, a toolkit for performing non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD) simulations to study fluid behaviour at low shear rates using
the LAMMPS software. By combining direct NEMD simulations and the
transient-time correlation function (TTCF) technique, we study the behaviour of
fluids over shear rates spanning $15$ orders of magnitude. We present two
example systems consisting of simple monatomic systems: one containing a bulk
liquid and another with a liquid layer confined between two solid walls. The
small bulk system is suitable for testing on personal computers, while the
larger confined system requires high-performance computing (HPC) resources. We
demonstrate that the TTCF formalism can successfully detect the system response
for arbitrarily weak external fields. We provide a brief mathematical
explanation for this feature. Although we showcase the method for simple
monatomic systems, TTCF can be readily extended to study more complex molecular
fluids. Moreover, in addition to shear flows, the method can be extended to
investigate elongational or mixed flows as well as thermal or electric fields.
The reasonably high computational cost needed for the method is offset by the
two following benefits: i) the cost is independent of the magnitude of the
external field, and ii) the simulations can be made highly efficient on HPC
architectures by exploiting the parallel design of LAMMPS. We expect the
toolkit to be useful for computational researchers striving to study the
nonequilibrium behaviour of fluids under experimentally-accessible conditions.

<h3>A Waddington landscape for prototype learning in generalized Hopfield  networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03012</a>
<br>
<i>Nacer Eddine Boukacem, Allen Leary, Robin Thériault, Felix Gottlieb, Madhav Mani, Paul François</i>
<p>Networks in machine learning offer examples of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems reminiscent of biological systems. Here, we study the
learning dynamics of Generalized Hopfield networks, which permit a
visualization of internal memories. These networks have been shown to proceed
through a 'feature-to-prototype' transition, as the strength of network
nonlinearity is increased, wherein the learned, or terminal, states of internal
memories transition from mixed to pure states. Focusing on the prototype
learning dynamics of the internal memories we observe a strong resemblance to
the canalized, or low-dimensional, dynamics of cells as they differentiate
within a Waddingtonian landscape. Dynamically, we demonstrate that learning in
a Generalized Hopfield Network proceeds through sequential 'splits' in memory
space. Furthermore, order of splitting is interpretable and reproducible. The
dynamics between the splits are canalized in the Waddington sense -- robust to
variations in detailed aspects of the system. In attempting to make the analogy
a rigorous equivalence, we study smaller subsystems that exhibit similar
properties to the full system. We combine analytical calculations with
numerical simulations to study the dynamical emergence of the
feature-to-prototype transition, and the behaviour of splits in the landscape,
saddles points, visited during learning. We exhibit regimes where saddles
appear and disappear through saddle-node bifurcations, qualitatively changing
the distribution of learned memories as the strength of the nonlinearity is
varied -- allowing us to systematically investigate the mechanisms that
underlie the emergence of Waddingtonian dynamics. Memories can thus
differentiate in a predictive and controlled way, revealing new bridges between
experimental biology, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning.

<h3>Braids and Higher-order Exceptional Points from the Interplay Between  Lossy Defects and Topological Boundary States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054</a>
<br>
<i>Zi-Jian Li, Gabriel Cardoso, Emil J. Bergholtz, Qing-Dong Jiang</i>
<p>We show that the perturbation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by a
localized lossy defect leads to higher-order exceptional points (HOEPs).
Depending on the location of the defect, third- and fourth-order exceptional
points (EP3s & EP4s) appear in the space of Hamiltonian parameters. On the one
hand, they arise due to the non-Abelian braiding properties of exceptional
lines (ELs) in parameter space. Namely, the HOEPs lie at intersections of
mutually non-commuting ELs. On the other hand, we show that such special
intersections happen due to the fact that the delocalization of edge states,
induced by the non-Hermitian defect, hybridizes them with defect states. These
can then coalesce together into an EP3. When the defect lies at the midpoint of
the chain, a special symmetry of the full spectrum can lead to an EP4. In this
way, our model illustrates the emergence of interesting non-Abelian topological
properties in the multiband structure of non-Hermitian perturbations of
topological phases.

<h3>Suppression of Shot Noise in a Dirty Marginal Fermi Liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03071" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03071</a>
<br>
<i>Tsz Chun Wu, Matthew S. Foster</i>
<p>We study shot noise in a two-dimensional, disordered marginal Fermi liquid
(MFL) driven out of equilibrium. We consider electrons with Planckian
dissipation on the Fermi surface coupled to quantum-critical bosons in the
presence of disorder. In the non-interacting and strong fermion-boson drag
limits, MFL effects disappear and our theory reproduces known results.
Interestingly, in the case where the bosons remain in equilibrium, MFL effects
play a role and the shot noise reduces rapidly as the electron-boson coupling
strength increases. Our results suggest that shot noise can be strongly
suppressed in quantum-critical systems, and this scenario may be relevant to
recent measurements in a heavy-fermion strange metal.

<h3>Universality in driven open quantum matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03073" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03073</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas M. Sieberer, Michael Buchhold, Jamir Marino, Sebastian Diehl</i>
<p>Universality is a powerful concept, which enables making qualitative and
quantitative predictions in systems with extensively many degrees of freedom.
It finds realizations in almost all branches of physics, including in the realm
of nonequilibrium systems. Our focus here is on its manifestations within a
specific class of nonequilibrium stationary states: driven open quantum matter.
Progress in this field is fueled by a number of uprising platforms ranging from
light-driven quantum materials over synthetic quantum systems like cold atomic
gases to the functional devices of the noisy intermediate scale quantum era.
These systems share in common that, on the microscopic scale, they obey the
laws of quantum mechanics, while detailed balance underlying thermodynamic
equilibrium is broken due to the simultaneous presence of Hamiltonian unitary
dynamics and nonunitary drive and dissipation. The challenge is then to connect
this microscopic physics to macroscopic observables, and to identify universal
collective phenomena that uniquely witness the breaking of equilibrium
conditions, thus having no equilibrium counterparts. In the framework of a
Lindblad-Keldysh field theory, we discuss on the one hand the principles
delimiting thermodynamic equilibrium from driven open stationary states, and on
the other hand show how unifying concepts such as symmetries, the purity of
states, and scaling arguments are implemented. We then present instances of
universal behavior structured into three classes: new realizations of
paradigmatic nonequilibrium phenomena, including a survey of first experimental
realizations; novel instances of nonequilibrium universality found in these
systems made of quantum ingredients; and genuinely quantum phenomena out of
equilibrium, including in fermionic systems. We also discuss perspectives for
future research on driven open quantum matter.

<h3>Scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy in $α$-RuCl$_3$: A quantum  Monte Carlo study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03080</a>
<br>
<i>Toshihiro Sato, B. J. Ramshaw, K. A. Modic, Fakher F. Assaad</i>
<p>We compute the rotational anisotropy of the free energy of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
in an external magnetic field. This quantity, known as the magnetotropic
susceptibility, $k$, relates to the second derivative of the free energy with
respect to the angle of rotation. We have used approximation-free,
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations for a realistic model of
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and optimized the path integral to alleviate the negative
sign problem. This allows us to reach temperatures down to $30~\rm{K}$ -- an
energy scale below the dominant Kitaev coupling. We demonstrate that the
magnetotropic susceptibility in this model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ displays unique
scaling, $k = Tf(B/T)$, with distinct scaling functions $f$ at high and low
temperatures. In comparison, for the XXZ Heisenberg model, the scaling $k =
Tf(B/T)$ breaks down at a temperature scale where the uniform spin
susceptibility deviates from the Curie law (i.e. at the energy scale of the
exchange interactions) and never recovers at low temperatures. Our findings
suggest that correlations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ lead to degrees of freedom that
respond isotropically to a magnetic field. One possible interpretation for the
apparent scale-invariance observed in experiments could be fractionalization of
the spin degrees of freedom in the extended Kitaev model.

<h3>Magneto-optical response of the Weyl semimetal NbAs: Experimental  results and hyperbolic-band computations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03094</a>
<br>
<i>S. Polatkan, E. Uykur, J. Wyzula, M. Orlita, C. Shekhar, C. Felser, M. Dressel, A. V. Pronin</i>
<p>The magneto-optical properties of (001)-oriented NbAs single crystals have
been studied in the spectral range from 5 to 150 meV and in magnetic fields of
up to 13 T. A rich spectrum of inter-Landau-level transitions is revealed by
these measurements. The transitions follow a square-root-like dependence with
magnetic field, but the simple linear-band approximation is unable to
accurately reproduce the observed behavior of the transitions in applied
fields. We argue that the detected magneto-optical spectra should be related to
crossing hyperbolic bands, which form the W1 cones. We propose a model
Hamiltonian, which describes coupled hyperbolic bands and reproduces the shape
of the relevant bands in NbAs. The magneto-optical spectra computed from this
Hamiltonian nicely reproduce our observations. We conclude that the
hyperbolic-band approach is a minimal model to adequately describe the
magneto-optical response of NbAs and that the chiral (conical) bands do not
explicitly manifest themselves in the spectra.

<h3>U(1) quantum spin liquids in dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets: a  fermionic parton approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03106</a>
<br>
<i>Krushna Chandra Sahu, Sambuddha Sanyal</i>
<p>We study the uniform $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) with low-energy
fermionic quasiparticles for pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-octupolar
symmetry, employing a fermionic parton mean field theory approach.
Self-consistent calculations stabilize 12 fully symmetric uniform $U(1)$ QSLs;
of which four mean-field states are "monopole-flux" states. Several of these
mean-field states show a linear temperature dependence of specific heat at low
temperatures; the other phases show a power law temperature dependence of
specific heat $C \sim T^\alpha$, where $\alpha $ is close to 1. We further
compute the dynamic spin structure factors and discuss the possible signature
of these fermionic spinons in neutron-scattering experiments on DO magnetic
systems. Our results provide a possible way to understand the metallic specific
heat response in $Nd_2 Sc Nb O_7$.

<h3>Absence of backscattering in Fermi-arc-mediated conductivity of  topological Dirac semimetal Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$</h3>

<i>Vsevolod Ivanov, Lotte Borkowski, Xiangang Wan, Sergey Y. Savrasov</i>
<p>Having previously been the subject of decades of semiconductor research,
cadmium arsenide has now reemerged as a topological material, realizing ideal
three-dimensional Dirac points at the Fermi level. These topological Dirac
points lead to a number of extraordinary transport phenomena, including strong
quantum oscillations, large magnetoresistance, ultrahigh mobilities, and Fermi
velocities exceeding graphene. The large mobilities persist even in thin films
and nanowires of cadmium arsenide, suggesting the involvement of topological
surface states. However, computational studies of the surface states in this
material are lacking, in part due to the large 80-atom unit cell. Here we
present the computed Fermi arc surface states of a cadmium arsenide thin film,
based on a tight-binding model derived directly from the electronic structure.
We show that despite the close proximity of the Dirac points, the Fermi arcs
are very long and straight, extending through nearly the entire Brillouin zone.
The shape and spin properties of the Fermi arcs suppress both back- and side-
scattering at the surface, which we show by explicit integrals over the phase
space. The introduction of a small symmetry-breaking term, expected in a strong
electric field, gaps the electronic structure, creating a weak topological
insulator phase that exhibits similar transport properties. Crucially, the
mechanisms suppressing scattering in this material differ from those in other
topological materials such as Weyl semimetals and topological insulators,
suggesting a new route for engineering high-mobility devices based on Dirac
semimetal surface states.

<h3>The Automated Bias Triangle Feature Extraction Framework</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03110" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03110</a>
<br>
<i>Madeleine Kotzagiannidis, Jonas Schuff, Nathan Korda</i>
<p>Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of Quantum Dot (QD)
devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spin
physics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability of
data as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered an
automatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) on
human labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction framework
for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision
methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of
physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large
training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented,
while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature
labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB)
detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training
data as a direct result of this approach.

<p>We present an approach for GW calculations of quasiparticle energies with
quasi-quadratic scaling by approximating high-energy contributions to the
Green's function in its Lehmann representation with effective stochastic
vectors. The method is easy to implement without altering the GW code,
converges rapidly with stochastic parameters, and treats systems of various
dimensionality and screening response. Our calculations on a 5.75$^\circ$
twisted MoS$_2$ bilayer show how large-scale GW methods include geometry
relaxations and electronic correlations on an equal basis in structurally
nontrivial materials.

<h3>Fractal packing of nanomaterials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03117</a>
<br>
<i>Dietrich E. Wolf, Thorsten Pöschel</i>
<p>Cohesive particles form agglomerates that are usually very porous. Their
geometry, particularly their fractal dimension, depends on the agglomeration
process (diffusion-limited or ballistic growth by adding single particles or
cluster-cluster aggregation). However, in practice, the packing structure
depends not only on the initial formation but also on the mechanical processing
of the agglomerate after it has grown. Surprisingly, the packing converges to a
statistically invariant structure under certain process conditions, independent
of the initial growth process. We consider the repeated fragmentation on a
given length scale, followed by ballistic agglomeration. Examples of
fragmentation are sieving with a given mesh size or dispersion in a turbulent
fluid. We model the agglomeration by gravitational sedimentation. The
asymptotic structure is fractal up to the fragmentation length scale, and the
fragments have a power-law size distribution. A scaling relation connects the
power law and the fractal dimension.

<h3>Longitudinal (curvature) couplings of an $N$-level qudit to a  superconducting resonator at the adiabatic limit and beyond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03118</a>
<br>
<i>Rusko Ruskov, Charles Tahan</i>
<p>Understanding how and to what magnitude solid-state qubits couple to metallic
wires is crucial to the design of quantum systems such as quantum computers.
Here, we investigate the coupling between a multi-level system, or qudit, and a
superconducting (SC) resonator's electromagnetic field, focusing on the
interaction involving both the transition and diagonal dipole moments of the
qudit. Specifically, we explore the effective dynamical (time-dependent)
longitudinal coupling that arises when a solid-state qudit is adiabatically
modulated at small gate frequencies and amplitudes, in addition to a static
dispersive interaction with the SC resonator. For the first time, we derive
Hamiltonians describing the longitudinal multi-level interactions in a general
dispersive regime, encompassing both dynamical longitudinal and dispersive
interactions. These Hamiltonians smoothly transition between their adiabatic
values, where the couplings of the n-th level are proportional to the level's
energy curvature concerning a qudit gate voltage, and the substantially larger
dispersive values, which occur due to a resonant form factor. We provide
several examples illustrating the transition from adiabatic to dispersive
coupling in different qubit systems, including the charge (1e DQD) qubit, the
transmon, the double quantum dot singlet-triplet qubit, and the triple quantum
dot exchange-only qubit. In some of these qubits, higher energy levels play a
critical role, particularly when their qubit's dipole moment is minimal or
zero. For an experimentally relevant scenario involving a spin-charge qubit
with magnetic field gradient coupled capacitively to a SC resonator, we
showcase the potential of these interactions. They enable
close-to-quantum-limited quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements and remote
geometric phase gates, demonstrating their practical utility in quantum
information processing.

<h3>Local and nonlocal electronic correlations at the metal-insulator  transition in the Hubbard model in two dimensions</h3>

<br>
<i>Maria Chatzieleftheriou, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov</i>
<p>Elucidating the physics of the single-orbital Hubbard model in its
intermediate coupling regime is a key missing ingredient to our understanding
of metal-insulator transitions in real materials. Using recent non-perturbative
many-body techniques that are able to interpolate between the
spin-fluctuation-dominated Slater regime at weak coupling and the Mott
insulator at strong-coupling, we obtain the momentum-resolved spectral function
in the intermediate regime and disentangle the effects of antiferromagnetic
fluctuations and local electronic correlations in the formation of an
insulating state. This allows us to identify the Slater and Heisenberg regimes
in the phase diagram, which are separated by a crossover region of competing
spatial and local electronic correlations. We identify the crossover regime by
investigating the behavior of the local magnetic moment, shedding light on the
formation of the insulating state at intermediate couplings.

<i>Sergey Fomichev, Vladimir Burdov</i>
<p>It has been shown theoretically that strong quantum confinement regime in Si
nanocrystals promotes the highly efficient simultaneous excitation of two
electron-hole pairs (biexciton) by a single photon. The rate (inverse lifetime)
of biexciton generation has been calculated analytically as function of the
nanocrystal radius. In contrast to the case of a nanocrystal formed of
direct-band-gap semiconductor, the size-dependence of the rate in Si
nanocrystal turns out to be sharp enough. At radii approaching a nanometer, the
lifetime of biexciton generation falls into the nanosecond range.

<p>Electronic interferometers using the chiral, one-dimensional (1D) edge
channels of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) can demonstrate a wealth of
fundamental phenomena. The recent observation of phase jumps in a single edge
channel Fabry-P\'erot (FP) interferometer revealed anyonic quasiparticle
exchange statistics in the fractional QHE. When multiple edge channels are
involved, FP interferometers have exhibited anomalous Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
interference frequency doubling, suggesting interference of 2e quasiparticles.
Here, we use a highly tunable graphene-based QHE FP interferometer to observe
the connection between integer QHE interference phase jumps and AB frequency
doubling, unveiling the intricate nature of inter edge state coupling in a
multichannel QHE interferometer. By tuning the electron density continuously
from the QHE filling factor {\nu}<2 to {\nu}>7, we observe periodic
interference phase jumps leading to AB frequency doubling. Our observations
clearly demonstrate that in our samples the combination of repulsive Coulomb
interaction between the spin-split, copropagating edge channels and charge
quantization explains the frequency-doubled regime without electron pairing,
via a near-perfect anti-correlation between the two edge channels. Our results
show that interferometers are sensitive probes of microscopic interactions
between edge states, which can cause strong correlations between chiral 1D
channels even in the integer QHE regime.

<p>Extension of coherent response time is a desired goal in the field of
all-optical information processing implemented in classical and quantum ways.
Here we demonstrate how spin-dependent stimulated photon echo can be used to
extend decay time of coherent signal from exciton ensemble. We experimentally
studied photon echoes from excitons in a model single InGaAs/GaAs quantum well
subject to transverse magnetic field. Field-induced quantum beats lead to
oscillation of exciton population between bright and long-lived dark excitons.
As a result, photon echo decays much longer with decay time attaining dark
exciton lifetime in case of non-oscillatory regime.

<i>Albane Théry, Alexander Chamolly, Eric Lauga</i>
<p>Biased locomotion is a common feature of microorganisms, but little is known
about its impact on self-organisation. Inspired by recent experiments showing a
transition to large-scale flows, we study theoretically the dynamics of
magnetotactic bacteria confined to a drop. We reveal two symmetry-breaking
mechanisms (one local chiral and one global achiral) leading to
self-organisation into global vortices and a net torque exerted on the drop.
The collective behaviour is ultimately controlled by the swimmers' microscopic
chirality and, strikingly, the system can exhibit oscillations and memory-like

<i>Adipta Pal, Dániel Varjas, Ashley M. Cook</i>
<p>Nonlinear response signatures are increasingly recognized as useful probes of
condensed matter systems, in particular for characterisation of topologically
non-trivial states. The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is particularly
useful in study of topological semimetals, as the CPGE tensor quantises for
well-isolated topological degeneracies in strictly linearly-dispersing band
structures. Here, we study multiplicative Weyl semimetal band-structures, and
find that the multiplicative structure robustly protects the quantization of
the CPGE even in the case of non-linear dispersion. Computing phase diagrams as
a function of Weyl node tilting, we find a variety of quantised values for the
CPGE tensor, revealing that the CPGE is also a useful tool in detecting and
characterising parent topology of multiplicative topological states.

<p>A key observable in investigations into quantum systems are the $n$-body
correlation functions, which provide a powerful tool for experimentally
determining coherence and directly probing the many-body wavefunction. While
the (bosonic) correlations of photonic systems are well explored, the
correlations present in matter-wave systems, particularly for fermionic atoms,
are still an emerging field. In this work, we use the unique single-atom
detection properties of $^3$He* atoms to perform simultaneous measurements of
the $n$-body quantum correlations, up to the fifth-order, of a degenerate Fermi
gas. In a direct demonstration of the Pauli exclusion principle, we observe
clear anti-bunching at all orders and find good agreement with predicted
correlation volumes. Our results pave the way for using correlation functions
to probe some of the rich physics associated with fermionic systems, such as
d-wave pairing in superconductors.

<h3>Evidence for the novel type of orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov  state in the bulk limit of 2H-NbSe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03215</a>
<br>
<i>Chang-woo Cho, Kwan To Lo, Cheuk Yin Ng, Abdel Rahman Allan, Mahmoud Abdel-Hafiez, Rolf Lortz</i>
<p>The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, an unusual superconducting
state, exhibits remarkable resilience against high magnetic fields that surpass
the Pauli paramagnetic limit for superconductivity. This state, characterized
by a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter in real space,
is extremely rare. Recently, an even more exotic variant, the orbital FFLO
state, has been first predicted and later identified in the transition metal
dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. This state is observed in thin samples
at the boundary between two and three dimensions, specifically for sample
thicknesses below approximately 40 nm. The complex interplay between Ising spin
orbit coupling and the Pauli paramagnetic effect can lead to a stabilization of
the FFLO state in a relatively large range of the phase diagram, even below the
Pauli limit. In this study, we present experimental evidence of the formation
of this orbital FFLO state in true bulk 2H-NbSe2 samples. This evidence was
obtained using high-resolution magnetic torque experiments in magnetic fields
applied strictly parallel to the NbSe2 basal plane. The magnetic torque reveals
a small step-like reversible anomaly, indicating a magnetic field-induced
thermodynamic phase transition within the superconducting state. This anomaly
bears many similarities to the FFLO transitions in other FFLO superconductors,
suggesting the potential existence of an orbital FFLO state in bulk 2H-NbSe2
samples. Additionally, we observe a pronounced in-plane 6-fold symmetry of the
upper critical field in the field range above this phase transition, which has
previously been interpreted as a hallmark of the orbital FFLO state in thin
2H-NbSe2.

<p>The brain criticality framework has largely considered brain dynamics to be
monofractal even though experimental evidence suggests that the brain exhibits
significant multifractality. To understand how multifractality may emerge in
critical-like systems, we use a computational model for critical neural
oscillations. We find that multifractality emerges near a synchronization phase
transition. These findings show multifractality in temporal dynamics peaks at
criticality in neural fields, providing a generative model for interpreting
multifractality in brain recordings.

<br>
<i>Adel Mehrpooya, Vivien J. Challis, Pascal R. Buenzli</i>
<p>The propagation of signalling molecules within cellular networks is affected
by network topology, but also by the spatial arrangement of cells in the
networks. Understanding the collective reaction--diffusion behaviour in space
of signals propagating through cellular networks is an important consideration
for example for regenerative signals that convey positional information. In
this work, we consider stochastic and deterministic random walk models of
signalling molecules propagating and reacting within one-dimensional spatial
networks with arbitrary node placement and connectivity. By taking a continuum
limit of the random walk models, we derive an inhomogeneous
reaction--diffusion--advection equation, where diffusivity and advective
velocity depend on local node density and connectivity within the network. Our
results show that large spatial variations of molecule concentrations can be
induced by heterogeneous node distributions. Furthermore, we find that noise
within the stochastic random walk model is directly influenced by node density.
We apply our models to consider signal propagation within the osteocyte network
of bone, where signals propagating to the bone surface regulate bone formation
and resorption processes. We investigate signal-to-noise ratios for different
damage detection scenarios and show that the location of perturbations to the
network can be detected by signals received at the network boundaries.

<p>A two-dimensional (2D) quantum electron system is characterized by the
quantized energy levels, or subbands, in the out-of-plane direction. Populating
higher subbands and controlling the inter-subband transitions have wide
technological applications such as optical modulators and quantum cascade
lasers. In conventional materials, however, the tunability of intersubband
spacing is limited. Here we demonstrate electrostatic population and
characterization of the second subband in few-layer InSe quantum wells, with
giant tunability of its energy, population, and spin-orbit coupling strength,
via the control of not only layer thickness but also out-of-plane displacement
field. A modulation of as much as 350% or over 250 meV is achievable,
underscoring the promise of InSe for tunable infrared and THz sources,
detectors and modulators.

<p>The combination of repulsive and attractive Coulomb interactions in a quantum
electron(e)-hole(h) fluid can give rise to novel correlated phases of
multiparticle charge complexes such as excitons, trions and biexcitons. Here we
report the first experimental realization of an electrically controlled
interlayer trion fluid in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. We
demonstrate that in the strong coupling regime of electron-hole bilayers,
electrons and holes in separate layers can spontaneously form three-particle
trion bound states that resemble positronium ions in high energy physics. The
interlayer trions can assume 1e-2h and 2e-1h configurations, where electrons
and holes are confined in different transition metal dichalcogenide layers. We
show that the two correlated holes in 1e-2h trions form a spin-singlet state
with a spin gap of ~1meV. By electrostatic gating, the equilibrium state of our
system can be continuously tuned into an exciton fluid, a trion fluid, an
exciton-trion mixture, a trion-charge mixture or an electron-hole plasma. Upon
optical excitation, the system can host novel high-order multiparticle charge
complexes including interlayer four-particle complex (tetrons) and
five-particle complex (pentons). Our work demonstrates a unique platform to
study novel correlated phases of tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures and opens up new
opportunities to realize artificial ions/molecules in electronic devices.

<h3>An Assessment of Thermally Driven Local Structural Phase Changes in  1$T$$'$- MoTe$_2$</h3>

<i>Sumit Khadka, Leighanne C. Gallington, Byron Freelon</i>
<p>The role of layer disorder is important in establishing the topological
phases of MoTe${_2}$. A rich tapestry of atomic ordering influences the
structural phase transitions (SPTs), but there is little understanding of the
mechanistic details of the phase transition. An atomistic level study was
conducted to investigate the local structure of the 1$T$$'$ and $T_d$ phases of
MoTe${_2}$ by using the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) technique. While the
average structure exhibits an SPT and co-existence of phases as a function of
temperature, the local structure shows the suppression of SPT at short-range
ordering, and the sample remains in the monoclinic (1$T$$'$) phase at all
measured temperatures. A sharp PDF peak observed at short distances indicated a
strong atom-atom correlation between the Mo and Te atoms within the
Mo-octahedra. In addition, a large box modeling of the PDF data indicated a
preferential motion of Te atoms towards $c$-axis at all temperatures. The
structural defects, such as stacking faults, likely result in the co-existence
of phases in the average structure and suppress the local SPT of MoTe$_2$.
These results are stepping stones in understanding the long-debated origins of
structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of MoTe$_2$ and similar
transition metal dichalcogenides.

<p>The mechanical characteristics of a monolithic (non-porous) crystalline or
amorphous material are described by a well-defined set of quantities. It is
possible to change the mechanical properties by introducing porosity into this
material: as a rule, the strength values decrease with the introduction of
porosity. Thus, porosity can be considered as an additional degree of freedom
that can be used to influence the hardness, strength and plasticity of the
material. In the present work, using porous crystalline NiTi as an example, it
is shown that the mechanical characteristics such as the Young's modulus, the
yield strength, the ultimate tensile strength, etc. demonstrate a pronounced
dependence on the average linear size $\bar{l}$ of the pores. For the first
time, an empirical equation is proposed that correctly reproduces the
dependence of the mechanical characteristics on the porosity $\phi$ and on the
average linear size $\bar{l}$ of the pores in a wide range of sizes: from
nano-sized pores to pores of a few hundred microns in size. This equation
correctly takes into account the limit case corresponding to the monolithic
material. The obtained results can be used directly to solve applied problems
associated with the design of materials with the necessary combination of
physical and mechanical characteristics, in particular, porous metallic
biomaterials.

<p>The choice of exchange functional is a critical factor in determining the
energy bandgap of semiconductors. Ab initio calculations using different
exchange functionals, including the conventional generalized-gradient
approximation (GGA) functionals, meta-GGA functionals, and hybrid functionals,
show significant differences in the calculated energy bandgap for
semiconducting half-Heusler compounds. These compounds, which have 18 valence
electrons per unit cell, are of great interest due to their thermoelectric
properties, making them suitable for energy conversion applications. In
addition, accounting for electronic correlations using the GW method also
affects the calculated energy bandgaps compared to standard GGA calculations.
The variations in calculated energy bandgaps are specific to each material when
using different functionals. Hence, a detailed investigation of the electronic
properties of each compound is necessary to determine the most appropriate
functional for an accurate description of the electronic properties. Our

<p>Controlling zero bias anomalies in magnetic atoms provides a promising
strategy to engineer tunable quantum many-body excitations. Here we show how
two different quantum impurities featuring spinaron and Kondo excitations can
be controlled via quantum confinement engineering by using circular quantum
corrals on a Ag(111) surface. In corrals built from both Ag and Co adatoms, the
width of the zero bias anomaly in the central Co adatom oscillates as a
function of corral radius with a period of half of the Ag(111) surface state
wavelength. Parameters extracted for Co/Ag(111) show only small differences in
extracted spinaron zero-bias anomaly between corral walls built from Ag or Co
adatoms. In quantum corrals occupied with metal-free phthalocyanine, a
paradigmatic $S=1/2$ Kondo system, we observe notable changes in the zero bias
anomaly lineshape as a function of corral radius. Our results offer insight
into many-body Kondo and spinaron resonances where the electronic density is
controlled by confinement engineering.

<i>Wanki Park, H.-S. Sim, Sungguen Ryu</i>
<p>A time-dependent potential barrier has been used to probe the arrival-time
distribution of the wave packet of a hot electron by raising the barrier to
block the packet upon arrival of the packet at the barrier. To see whether the
barrier precisely detects the distribution, it is necessary to study an error
caused by a finite rising speed of the barrier. For this purpose, we study
transmission of an electron wave packet through the dynamical barrier, and
identify two regimes, the semiclassical regime and the quasistatic regime. In
each regime, we calculate the arrival-time distribution reconstructed by using
the barrier and quantify the error in the detection, the difference of the
temporal uncertainty between the wave-packet distribution and the reconstructed
distribution. Our finding suggests that for precise detection, the time scale,
in which the barrier height rises over the energy distribution of the wave
packet and the tunneling energy window of the barrier, has to be much shorter
than the temporal uncertainty of the wave packet. The analytical results are
confirmed with numerical calculations.

immiscible components with alternating, interlocking domains. We identify three
Goldstone branches, each with first-sound, second-sound or spin-sound
character. In analogy with a diatomic crystal, the resulting lattice has a
two-domain primitive basis and we find that the crystal (first-sound-like)
branch is split into optical and acoustic phonons. We also find a spin-Higgs
branch that is associated with the supersolid modulation amplitude.

<p>We investigate the properties of a two-dimensional \emph{spinor} microcavity
polariton system driven by a linearly polarised continuous pump. In particular,
we establish the role of the elementary excitations, namely the so-called
half-vortices and full-vortices; these objects carry a quantum rotation only in
one of the two, or both, spin components respectively. Our numerical analysis
of the steady-state shows that it is only the half-vortices that are present in
the vortex-antivortex pairing/dissociation responsible for the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. These are the relevant elementary
excitations close to the critical point. However, by exploring the
phase-ordering dynamics following a sudden quench across the transition we
prove that full-vortices become the relevant excitations away from the critical
point in a deep quasi-ordered state at late times. The time-scales for
half-vortices binding into full vortices are much faster than the
vortex-antivortex annihilations.

<p>"AI for science" is widely recognized as a future trend in the development of
scientific research. Currently, although machine learning algorithms have
played a crucial role in scientific research with numerous successful cases,
relatively few instances exist where AI assists researchers in uncovering the
underlying physical mechanisms behind a certain phenomenon and subsequently
using that mechanism to improve machine learning algorithms' efficiency. This
article uses the investigation into the relationship between extreme Poisson's
ratio values and the structure of amorphous networks as a case study to
illustrate how machine learning methods can assist in revealing underlying
physical mechanisms. Upon recognizing that the Poisson's ratio relies on the
low-frequency vibrational modes of dynamical matrix, we can then employ a
convolutional neural network, trained on the dynamical matrix instead of
traditional image recognition, to predict the Poisson's ratio of amorphous
networks with a much higher efficiency. Through this example, we aim to
showcase the role that artificial intelligence can play in revealing
fundamental physical mechanisms, which subsequently improves the machine

<p>The shape of the Fermi surface influences many physical phenomena in
materials and a growing interest in how the spin-dependent properties are
related to the fermiology of crystals has surged. Recently, a novel
current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance effect, known as bilinear
magnetoelectric resistance (BMR), has been shown to be not only sensitive to
the spin-texture in spin-polarized non-magnetic materials, but also dependent
on the convexity of the Fermi surface in topological semimetals. In this paper,
we show that the temperature dependence of the BMR signal strongly depends on
the crystal axis of the semimetallic MoTe${}_2$. For the a-axis, the amplitude
of the signal remains fairly constant, while for the b-axis it reverses sign at
about 100 K. We calculate the BMR efficiencies at 10 K to be $\chi^{J}_{A} =
(100\pm3)$ nm${}^2$T${}^{-1}$A${}^{-1}$ and $\chi^{J}_{B} = (-364\pm13)$
nm${}^2$T${}^{-1}$A${}^{-1}$ for the a- and b-axis, respectively, and we find
that they are comparable to the efficiencies measured for WTe${}_2$. We use
density functional theory calculations to compute the Fermi surfaces of both
phases at different energy levels and we observe a change in convexity of the
outer-most electron pocket as a function of the Fermi energy. Our results
suggest that the BMR signal is mostly dominated by the change in the Fermi
surface convexity.

<p>The creation of multilayer graphene (Gr), while preserving the brilliant
properties of monolayer Gr derived from its unique band structure, can expand
the application field of Gr to the macroscale. However, the energy-favorable AB
stacking structure in the multilayer Gr induces a strong interlayer interaction
and alters the band structure. Consequently, the intrinsic properties of each
monolayer are degraded. In this work, we insert carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as
nanospacers to modulate the microstructure of multilayer stacking Gr.
Nanospacers can increase the interlayer distance and reduce the interlayer
interaction. The Gr/CNT stacking structure is experimentally fabricated using a
dry transfer method in a layer-by-layer manner. Raman spectroscopy verifies the
reduction in the interlayer interaction within the stacking structure. Atomic
force microscopy shows an increase in the interlayer distance, which can
explain the weakening of the interlayer interactions. The microstructure of the
stacked Gr and CNTs is studied by molecular dynamics simulation to
systematically investigate the effect of CNT insertion. We found that the
distribution distance, size, and arrangement of the CNT can modulate the
interlayer distance. These results will help us to understand and improve the
properties of the composite systems consisting of Gr and CNTs.

<p>We consider the problem of local correlations in the kicked, dual-unitary
coupled maps on D-dimensional lattices. We demonstrate that for D>=2, fully
dual-unitary systems exhibit ultra-local correlations: the correlations between
any pair of operators with local support vanish in a finite number of time
steps. In addition, for $D=2$, we consider the partially dual-unitary regime of
the model, where the dual-unitarity applies to only one of the two spatial
directions. For this case, we show that correlations generically decay
exponentially and provide an explicit formula for the correlation function
between the operators supported on two and four neighbouring sites.

possible topological superconductivity. In this work, we study the upper
critical fields $\mu_{0}H_{c2}$ of 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$ and
4$H_{b}$-TaS$_{1.99}$Se$_{0.01}$ single crystals systematically. Transport
measurements up to 35 T show that both of ${ab}$-plane and ${c}$-axis upper
critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{c2,c}$) for
4$H_{b}$-TaS$_{2}$ and 4$H_{b}$-TaS$_{1.99}$Se$_{0.01}$ exhibit a linear
temperature dependent behavior down to 0.3 K, suggesting the three-dimensional
superconductivity with dominant orbital depairing mechanism in bulk
4$H_{b}$-Ta(S, Se)$_{2}$. However, the zero-temperature $\mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}$(0)
for both crystals are far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit
$\mu_{0}H{\rm_{P}}$. It could be explained by the effects of spin-momentum
locking in 1$H$-Ta(S, Se)$_{2}$ layers with local inversion symmetry broken and
the relatively weak intersublattice interaction between 1$H$ layers due to the
existence of 1$T$ layers.

<p>Information based thermodynamic logic is revisited. It consists of two parts:
Part A applies the modern theory of probability in which an arbitrary convex
function \phi is employed as an analytic "device" to express information as
statistical dependency contained in the topological sub-\sigma-algebra
structure. Via thermo-doubling, Fenchel-Young equality (FYE) that consists of
\phi(x) and its conjugate \psi(y) establishes the notion of equilibrium between
x and y through duality symmetry and the principle of maximum entropy/minimum
free energy. Part B deals with a given set of repetitive measurements, where an
inherent convex function emerges via the mathematics of large deviations.
Logarithm-based Shannon entropy with \phi(x)=-\log x figures prominently for
i.i.d. sample statistics. Information can be a measure of the agreement between
a statistical observation and its theoretical models. Maximum likelihood
principle arises here and FYE provides a thermodynamic energetic narrative of

<p>We explore the state of matter characterized by the charged timelike vector
order parameter. We employ holographic duality in order to construct such a
state and study its thermoelectric transport, fermionic spectral function and
the sign of the Meissner effect. We uncover the unusual features of this
"timelike superconductor": the absence of the gap in the fermionic spectrum and
co-existence of Drude peak and supercurrent in the AC transport, which are
reminiscent to those of time-reversal-odd and gapless superconductors,
correspondingly. We show that this state is dynamically stable and
thermodynamically at least metastable. Along the way we develop the holographic
model of the charged vector field, which acquires mass due to a variant of the
Stueckelberg mechanism with the adjoint Higgs field.

<h3>Non-reciprocal topological solitons</h3>

<p>From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive
nonlinear excitations that are robust and that can be driven by external
fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and
antisolitons towards opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving
mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the
same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we
construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally
coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such
nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations -- so-called non-Hermitian skin
waves, which are typically unstable -- into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We
rationalize our observations by introducing non-reciprocal generalizations of
the Frenkel-Kontorova and sine-Gordon models, and use the latter to predict the
terminal velocity of the (anti)solitons and determine their stability. Finally,
we harness non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active
waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information.
More broadly, our findings suggest that non-reciprocal driving is a robust
mechanism to steer nonlinear waves and could be generalized beyond mechanics,
e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.

<h3>MXene Fe2C as a promising candidate for the 2D XY ferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03551</a>

<i>E. M. Agapov, I. A. Kruglov, A. A. Katanin</i>
<p>Monolayer Fe$_2$C is expected to possess strong electronic correlations,
which can significantly contribute to electronic and magnetic properties. In
this work we consider electronic and magnetic properties of MXene Fe$_2$C
within the DFT+DMFT approach. We establish the existence of local magnetic
moments $\mu=3.2\mu_B$ in this compound, characterized by sufficiently long
lifetime of $\tau\sim 350$ fs. We also calculate exchange interaction
parameters accounting for electronic correlations using the recently developed
approach for paramagnetic phase. We obtain the strongest exchange interaction
$11$ meV between next nearest neighboring Fe atoms above (and below) the carbon
plane, and the subleading interaction $6$ meV between the next to next nearest
neighboring atoms across the carbon plane. The resulting dependence of the
Berzinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Curie temperatures on magnetic
anisotropy is obtained. The BKT temperature for the pristine Fe$_2$C is $T_{\rm
BKT}\simeq 290$ K, which makes this compound a good candidate for the
two-dimensional ferromagnet with XY anisotropy.

<h3>A Machine-Learning-Accelerated Quantum Transport Study on the Effects of  Superlattice Disorder and Strain in a Mid-wave Infrared Curved Sensor</h3>

<p>An emerging device architecture for infrared imaging is the curved
focal-plane array which benefits from several optical advantages over the
traditional flat design. However, the curving process introduces additional
strain in the active region which must be taken into account. Type-II
superlattices, a promising alternative to traditional bulk materials for use in
infrared photodetectors, is a candidate material for use in these devices, but
the transport properties of these highly heterogeneous materials are not
straightforward and can be affected by different material conditions, such as
superlattice disorder and external strain. We present a comprehensive study of
the internal QE calculated for a curved device that incorporates finite element
analysis (FEA) modeling, nonequilibirium Green's functions (NEGF) calculations,
and Gaussian Process (GP) regression. FEA is used for predicting the strain
configuration throughout the active region induced by the curving procedure of
the device. NEGF is used to calculate the vertical hole mobility for a select
set of strain configurations, from which the internal quantum efficiency of the
device is approximated to predict performance under strained conditions. Then
this data set is used to train a GP model that maps the quantum efficiency QE
predictions onto the spatial coordinates of the curved device, based on the
strain configuration predicted using FEA. This analysis is performed for ideal
and disordered SLs to understand both the fundamental and practical limitations
of the performance of these materials in curved devices.

<h3>Superconductivity in the Bilayer Two-orbital Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03605</a>
<br>
<i>Yao-Yuan Zheng, Wéi Wú</i>
<p>Motivated by the recently discovered high $T_c$ nickelate superconductor
$\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$, we investigate superconductivity in a two dimensional
Hubbard model on square lattice that consists of two layers of hybridizing
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Employing cluster dynamical mean-field
theory, we establish phase diagrams resolving the crucial dependence of
superconducting $T_c$ on electron hybridization $V$ between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{z^2}$ orbitals at the same layer, and on the hopping $t_{\perp}$ between
two $d_{z^2}$ orbitals at different layers. $V$ and $t_{\perp}$ are presumably
linked to the pairing phase coherence, and "pairing glue" of the system
respectively. Our result favors a two-component theory explanation of
superconductivity in a composite system. The influence of the pseudogap effect
and Hund's coupling on superconductivity are discussed, and also the
implication of our result to the understanding of $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$
superconductivity.

<h3>Rotating quantum droplets confined in an anharmonic potential</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Nikolaou, G. M. Kavoulakis, M. Ogren</i>
<p>We investigate the rotational properties of quantum droplets, which form in a
mixture of two Bose-Einstein condensates, in the presence of an anharmonic
trapping potential. We identify various phases as the atom number and the
angular momentum/angular velocity of the trap vary. These phases include
center-of-mass-like excitation (without, or with vortices), vortices of single
and multiple quantization, etc. Finally, we compare our results with those of
the single-component problem.

<h3>Mean-Field Analysis of the Glassy Dynamics of an Elastoplastic Model of  Super-Cooled Liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03627" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03627</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph W. Baron, Giulio Biroli</i>
<p>We present a mean-field theory of a coarse-grained model of a super-cooled
liquid in which relaxation occurs via local plastic rearrangements. Local
relaxation can be induced by thermal fluctuations or by the long-range elastic
consequences of other rearrangements. We extract the temperature dependence of
both the relaxation time and the lengthscale of dynamical correlations. We find
two dynamical regimes. First, a regime in which the characteristic time and
length scales diverge as a power law at a critical temperature $T_c$. This
regime is found by an approximation that neglects activated relaxation
channels, which can be interpreted as akin to the one found by the
mode-coupling transition of glasses. In reality, only a cross-over takes place
at $T_c$. The residual plastic activity leads to a second regime characterised
by an Arrhenius law below $T_c$. In this case, we show that the lengthscale
governing dynamical correlations diverges as a power law as $T\to 0$, and is
logarithmically related to the relaxation time.

<p>Unconventional superconductivity often couples to other electronic orders in
a cooperative or competing fashion. Identifying external stimuli that tune
between these two limits is of fundamental interest. Here, we show that
$c$-axis strain couples directly to the competing interaction between charge
stripe order and superconductivity in La$_{1.88}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ (LSCO).
Compressive $c$-axis pressure amplifies stripe order within the superconducting
state, while having no impact on the normal state. By contrast, strain
dramatically diminishes the magnetic field enhancement of stripe order in the
superconducting state. This observation hints to the existence of a ground
state without phase competition. As such, c-axis pressure is a promising tuning
parameter in the search for ground states where superconductivity adopts broken
translational symmetry from charge ordering phenomena.

<h3>Fingerprints of the Jahn-Teller and superexchange physics in optical  spectra of manganites</h3>

<p>Transition metal oxides incorporating Jahn-Teller (JT) ions Mn3+ (3d4) in
manganites and Cu2+ (3d9) in cuprates exhibit outstanding magnetic and
electronic properties, including colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and
high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). The physics of these compounds is
associated with the orbitally-degenerate electronic states of JT ions, leading
to the linear electron-lattice interaction, complemented by the entirely
electronic superexchange (SE) interaction. Here, we discuss the fingerprints of
the JT and SE physics in the temperature-dependent complex dielectric function
spectra and multi-order Raman scattering spectra measured in a detwinned LaMnO3
crystal, which is a famous compound exhibiting cooperative JT effect, being
also a progenitor of magnetic materials exhibiting CMR effect. In accordance
with the obtained experimental evidence, the associated effective parameters
characterizing the JT and SE physics in manganites are presented.

<p>The asymmetric distribution of chiral objects with opposite chirality is of
great fundamental interests ranging from molecular biology to particle physics.
In quantum materials, chiral states can build on inversion-symmetry-breaking
lattice structures or emerge from spontaneous magnetic ordering induced by
competing interactions. Although the handedness of a chiral state can be
changed through external fields, a spontaneous chirality flipping has yet to be
discovered. In this letter, we present experimental evidence of chirality
flipping via changing temperature in a topological magnet EuAl$_4$, which
features orthogonal spin and charge density waves (SDW/CDW). Using circular
dichroism of Bragg peaks in the resonant magnetic x-ray scattering, we find
that the chirality of the helical SDW flips through a first order phase
transition with modified SDW wavelength. Intriguingly, we observe that the CDW
couples strongly with the SDW and displays a rare
commensurate-to-incommensurate transition at the chirality flipping
temperature. Combining with first principles calculations and angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we establish the Fermi surface origin of the
helical SDW with intertwined spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in
EuAl$_4$. Our results reveal an unprecedented spontaneous chirality flipping
and lays the groundwork for a new functional manipulation of chirality through
momentum dependent spin-charge-lattice interactions.

<h3>MatterGen: a generative model for inorganic materials design</h3>

<p>The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in
driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and
carbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design
by directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property
constraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low
success rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited
set of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates
stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further
be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property
constraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative
process that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,
coordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to
enable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled
dataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen
are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times
closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully
generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as
mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate
multi-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have
both high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain
risk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of
MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a
universal generative model for materials design.

<h3>Inverse Design of Vitrimeric Polymers by Molecular Dynamics and  Generative Modeling</h3>

<p>Vitrimer is a new class of sustainable polymers with the ability of
self-healing through rearrangement of dynamic covalent adaptive networks.
However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property
space, prohibiting full realization of their potential applications. Through a
combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML),
particularly a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) model, we establish a
method for generating novel vitrimers and guide their inverse design based on
desired glass transition temperature (Tg). We build the first vitrimer dataset
of one million and calculate Tg on 8,424 of them by high-throughput MD
simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed VAE employs
dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for
individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. By constructing a
continuous latent space containing necessary information of vitrimers, we
demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novel
vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the training regime. The proposed vitrimers
with reasonable synthesizability cover a wide range of Tg and broaden the
potential widespread usage of vitrimeric materials.
