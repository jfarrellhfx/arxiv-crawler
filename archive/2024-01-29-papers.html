<h3>Fabrication of robust capsules by sequential assembly of  polyelectrolytes onto charged liposomes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15329</a>
<br>
<i>Marta Ruano, Ana Mateos-Maroto, Francisco Ortega, Hernan Ritacco, Jose E. F. Rubio, Eduardo Guzman, Ramon G. Rubio</i>
<p>This work presents a simply methodology for coating small unilamellar
liposomes bearing different degrees of positive charge with polyelectrolyte
multilayers using the sequential Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition method. The
liposomes were made of mixtures of DOPC
(1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline) and DODAB (dimethyl dioctadecyl
ammonium bromide), and coated by alternated layers of the sodium salt of
poly(4-styrenesulfonate), PSS, and poly(allylamine), PAH, as polyanion and
polycations, respectively. The results shows that the zeta potential of the
liposomes was not very sensitive to the mole fraction of DODAB in the membrane,
XD, in the range 0.3< XD<0.8. We were able to coat the liposomes with up to
four polymer bilayers. The growth of the capsules size was followed by dynamic
light scattering, and in some cases by cryo-TEM, with good agreement between
both techniques. The thickness of the layers, measured from the hydrodynamic
radius of the coated liposome, depends on the polyelectrolyte used, so that the
PSS layers adopt a much more packaged conformation than the PAH layers. An
interesting finding is that the PSS amount needed to reach the isoelectric
point of the capsules increases linearly with the charge density of the bare
liposomes, whereas the amount of PAH does not depend on it. As expected, the
preparation of the multilayers has to be done in such a way that when the
system is close to the isoelectric point the capsules do not aggregate. For
this, we dropped the polyelectrolyte solution quickly, fast stirring and using
dilute liposome suspensions. The method is very flexible and not limited to
liposomes or polyelectrolyte multilayers, also coatings containing charged
nanoparticles can be easily made.

<h3>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in  conservative Hamiltonian systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083</a>
<br>
<i>Anxo Biasi</i>
<p>While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of
condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of
this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work, we present a novel form
of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems, which happens through
coherent states and exploits the discreteness of our system. Both features
markedly differ from well-known condensation processes in the literature. Our
result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions
representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a
dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer
of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the
excitation of high modes in finite time, a phenomenon quantified through the
blow-up of Sobolev norms. We provide a fully analytic description of all the
processes involved.

<h3>A Collision Operator for Describing Dissipation in Noncanonical Phase  Space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15086" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15086</a>
<br>
<i>Naoki Sato, Philip J. Morrison</i>
<p>The phase space of a noncanonical Hamiltonian system is partially
inaccessible due to dynamical constraints (Casimir invariants) arising from the
kernel of the Poisson tensor. When an ensemble of noncanonical Hamiltonian
systems is allowed to interact, dissipative processes eventually break the
phase space constraints, resulting in an equilibrium described by a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. However, the time scale required to reach
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is often much longer than the time scale over
which a given system achieves a state of thermal equilibrium. Examples include
diffusion in rigid mechanical systems, as well as collisionless relaxation in
magnetized plasmas and stellar systems, where the interval between binary
Coulomb or gravitational collisions can be longer than the time scale over
which stable structures are self-organized. Here, we focus on self-organizing
phenomena over spacetime scales such that particle interactions respect the
noncanonical Hamiltonian structure, but yet act to create a state of
thermodynamic equilibrium. We derive a collision operator for general
noncanonical Hamiltonian systems, applicable to fast, localized interactions.
This collision operator depends on the interaction exchanged by colliding
particles and on the Poisson tensor encoding the noncanonical phase space
structure, is consistent with entropy growth and conservation of particle
number and energy, preserves the interior Casimir invariants, reduces to the
Landau collision operator in the limit of grazing binary Coulomb collisions in
canonical phase space, and exhibits a metriplectic structure. We further show
how thermodynamic equilibria depart from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics due to
the noncanonical phase space structure, and how self-organization and
collisionless relaxation in magnetized plasmas and stellar systems can be
described through the derived collision operator.

<h3>Thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the Ising model with  nonmagnetic impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15087</a>
<br>
<i>D. N. Yasinskaya, Yu. D. Panov</i>
<p>We consider a system of Ising spins s=1/2 with nonmagnetic impurities with
charge associated with pseudospin S=1. The charge density is fixed pursuant to
the concentration n. Analysis of the thermodynamic properties in the
one-dimensional case showed the presence of so-called pseudotransitions at the
boundaries between the staggered charge ordering and (anti)ferromagnetic
ordering. In the case of n=0, a "1st order" pseudotransition was discovered.
This type of pseudotransition is inherent for a series of other one-dimensional
frustrated models. However, for n != 0 we discovered a new type of "2nd order"
pseudotransition, which had not previously been observed in other systems.

<h3>Maximum entropy in dynamic complex networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15090</a>
<br>
<i>Noam Abadi, Franco Ruzzenenti</i>
<p>Understanding common properties of different systems is a challenging task
for interdisciplinary research. By representing these systems as complex
networks, different fields facilitate their comparison. Common properties can
then be extracted by network randomisation, in which a stochastic process
preserves some properties of the network modifying others. If different systems
exhibit statistically similar characteristics after being randomised by the
same process, then these characteristics are taken to be explained by the
preserved properties. The method of maximum entropy provides a way to
completely bypass the construction of specific randomisation processes,
directly obtaining ensembles of fully randomised networks,knowing that these
contain no information beyond the imposed properties. The perspective of
randomisation processes with associated dynamics has been used to obtain
important and widespread properties of networks, suggesting that these are
better explained from a dynamic perspective. In this work we use the maximum
entropy based principle of maximum caliber to construct the evolution of an
ensemble of networks based on constraints representing properties with known
values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics
resulting from conserved and variable number of links, comparing each to
simulations of randomisation processes that obey the same constraints. We find
that the simulations produce the same ensemble evolution as maximum caliber,
that the equilibrium distributions converge to known stationary results of
maximum entropy given the same constraints, discuss connections to other
maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics, and conclude by pointing out
several avenues of future research.

<h3>Electronic structure and superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15097</a>
<br>
<i>Yuxin Wang, Kun Jiang, Ziqiang Wang, Fu-Chun Zhang, Jiangping Hu</i>
<p>We show that the crystal field splitting, the bilayer coupling, and
electron-electron correlations all play a crucial role in creating an
electronic environment similar to hole-doped cuprates for high temperature
superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. The
previous density functional theory calculations highly underestimated the
crystal field splitting and bilayer coupling. Employing the hybrid
exchange-correlation functional, we show that the exchange-correlation pushes
the antibonding $d_{z^2}$ bands below the Fermi level to be fully occupied in
both the low-pressure (LP) non-superconducting phase and the high-pressure (HP)
phase exhibiting superconductivity. In the LP phase, the calculated Fermi
surfaces and the correlation normalized band structure match well with the
experimental findings at ambient pressure. Moreover, the electronic
susceptibility calculated for this new band structure features nesting-induced
peaks near the wave vector $Q=(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, suggesting a possible density
wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. In the HP phase, an
inversion symmetry between the bilayer emerges and produces a very different
band structure and Fermi surface, which can be described by low-energy
effective models for the inversion antisymmetric $\beta$ and symmetric $\alpha$
bands. The $\beta$ band turns out to be close to half-filling while the
$\alpha$ band is highly overdoped. Considering the strong local Coulomb
repulsion, we find a dominant pairing with $B_{1g}$ symmetry in the $\beta$
band that, upon Josephson coupling to the $\alpha$ band, drives a
superconducting ground state with a congruent $d$-wave symmetry. Our results
capture the essential physics of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ in both the LP and HP phases
and reveal its similarity and difference from the hole-doped cuprate
high-temperature superconductors.

<h3>First-principles Methodology for studying magnetotransport in magnetic  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15146</a>

<p>Unusual magnetotransport behaviors such as temperature dependent negative
magnetoresistance(MR) and bowtie-shaped MR have puzzled us for a long time.
Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain them, the absence of
comprehensive quantitative calculations has made these explanations less
convincing. In our work, we introduce a methodology to study the
magnetotransport behaviors in magnetic materials. This approach integrates
anomalous Hall conductivity induced by Berry curvature, with a multi-band
ordinary conductivity tensor, employing a combination of first-principles
calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our method
incorporates both the temperature dependency of relaxation time and anomalous
Hall conductivity, as well as the field dependency of anomalous Hall
conductivity. We initially test this approach on two-band models and then apply
it to a Weyl semimetal \CSS. The results, which align well with experimental
observations in terms of magnetic field and temperature dependencies,
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, we have investigated
the distinct behaviors of magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall resistivities across
various types of magnetic materials. This methodology provides a comprehensive
and efficient means to understand the underlying mechanisms of the unusual
behaviors observed in magneto-transport measurements in magnetic materials.

<h3>New perspectives of Hall effects from first-principles calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15150</a>
<br>
<i>ShengNan Zhang, Hanqi Pi, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, QuanSheng Wu</i>
<p>The Hall effect has been a fascinating topic ever since its discovery,
resulting in exploration of entire family of this intriguing phenomena. As the
field of topology develops and novel materials emerge endlessly over the past
few decades, researchers have been passionately debating the origins of various
Hall effects. Differentiating between the ordinary Hall effect and
extraordinary transport properties, like the anomalous Hall effect, can be
quite challenging, especially in high-conductivity materials, including those
with topological origins. In this study, we conduct a systematic and
comprehensive analysis of Hall effects by combining the semiclassical Boltzmann
transport theory with first principles calculations within the relaxation time
approximation. We first highlight some striking similarities between the
ordinary Hall effect and certain anomalous Hall effects, such as nonlinear
dependency on magnetic field and potential sign reversal of the Hall
resistivity. We then demonstrate that the Hall resistivity can be scaled with
temperature and magnetic field as well, analogue to the Kohler's rule which
scales the longitudinal resistivity under the relaxation time approximation. We
then apply this Kohler's rule for Hall resistivity to two representative
materials: ZrSiS and PtTe$_2$ with reasonable agreement with experimental
measurement. Moreover, our methodology has been proven to be applicable to the
planar Hall effects of bismuth, of perfect agreements with experimental
observations. Our research on the scaling behavior of Hall resistivity
addresses a significant gap in this field and provides a comprehensive
framework for a deeper understanding of the Hall resistance family, and thus
has potential to propel the field forward and spark further investigations into
the fascinating world of Hall effects.

<h3>First-principles methodology for studying magnetotransport in narrow-gap  semiconductors: an application to Zirconium Pentatelluride ZrTe5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15151</a>
<br>
<i>Hanqi Pi, Shengnan Zhang, Yang Xu, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu</i>
<p>The origin of anomalous resistivity peak and accompanied sign reversal of
Hall resistivity of ZrTe$_5$ has been under debate for a long time. Although
various theoretical models have been proposed to account for these intriguing
transport properties, a systematic study from first principles view is still
lacking. In this work, we present a first principles calculation combined with
Boltzmann transport theory to investigate the transport properties in
narrow-gap semiconductors at different temperatures and doping densities within
the relaxation time approximation. Regarding the sensitive
temperature-dependent chemical potential and relaxation time of semiconductors,
we take proper approximation to simulate these two variables, and then
comprehensively study the transport properties of ZrTe$_5$ both in the absence
and presence of an applied magnetic field. Without introducing topological
phases and correlation interactions, we qualitatively reproduced crucial
features observed in experiments, including zero-field resistivity anomaly,
nonlinear Hall resistivity with sign reversal, and non-saturating
magnetoresistance at high temperatures. Our calculation allows a systematic
interpretation of the observed properties in terms of multi-carrier and Fermi
surface geometry. Our method can be extended to other narrow-gap semiconductors
and further pave the way to explore interesting and novel transport properties
of this field.

<h3>Polaron spectra and edge singularities for correlated flat bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15155" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15155</a>
<br>
<i>Dimitri Pimenov</i>
<p>Single- and two-particle spectra of a single immobile impurity immersed in a
fermionic bath can be computed exactly and are characterized by divergent power
laws (edge singularities). Here, we present the leading lattice correction to
this canonical problem, by embedding both impurity and bath fermions in bands
with non-vanishing Bloch band geometry, with the impurity band being flat. By
analyzing generic Feynman diagrams, we pinpoint how the band geometry reduces
the effective interaction which enters the power laws; we find that for weak
lattice effects or small Fermi momenta, the leading correction is proportional
to the Fermi energy times the sum of the quantum metrics of the bands. When
only the bath fermion geometry is important, the results can be extended to
large Fermi momenta and strong lattice effects. We numerically illustrate our
results on the Lieb lattice and draw connections to ultracold gas experiments.

<h3>Collective dynamical Fermi suppression of optically-induced inelastic  scattering</h3>

<br>
<i>Camen A. Royse, J. Huang, J. E. Thomas</i>
<p>We observe strong dynamical suppression of optically-induced loss in a weakly
interacting Fermi gas as the $s$-wave scattering length is increased. The
single, cigar-shaped cloud behaves as a large spin lattice in energy space with
a tunable Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The loss suppression occurs as the lattice
transitions into a magnetized state, where the fermionic nature of the atoms
inhibits interactions. The data are quantitatively explained by incorporating
spin-dependent loss into a quasi-classical collective spin vector model, the
success of which enables the application of optical control of effective
long-range interactions to this system.

<h3>Rigid clusters in shear-thickening suspensions: a nonequilibrium  critical transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15165" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15165</a>
<br>
<i>Aritra Santra, Michel Orsi, Bulbul Chakraborty, Jeffrey F. Morris</i>
<p>The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension
in shear flow are studied by numerical simulation. The suspension exhibits the
lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition but is studied at stresses above
the levels that cause extreme shear thickening. At large solid area fraction,
$\phi$, but below the jamming fraction, we find that there is critical $\phi_c$
beyond which the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as
$f_{\rm rig} \sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$, and at which the
fluctuations in the net rigidity grow sharply, with a susceptibility measure
$\chi_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_c|^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. By applying
finite size scaling, the correlation length, arising from the correlation of
rigid domains, is found to scale as $\xi \sim |\phi-\phi_c|^{-\nu}$ with $\nu =
1$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality, with critical exponents
consistent with the 2D Ising transition. This behavior occurs over a range of
stresses, with $\phi_c$ increasing as the stress decreases, consistent with the
known increase in jamming fraction with reduction of stress for
shear-thickening suspensions.

<p>Nanocrystalline FeCuNbSiB thin films were fabricated through magnetron
sputtering followed by heat treatment, resulting in samples characterized by
low coercivity and high effective magnetization. Comprehensive microstructural
analysis, employing X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
techniques such as selected area electron diffraction, high-resolution imaging,
and Fourier transform, was conducted. Magnetic properties were investigated
using an alternating gradient field magnetometer and broadband ferromagnetic
resonance. The structural analysis revealed a well-defined microstructure of
nanograins within an amorphous matrix in all of our films. However, the
coercivity of the 80 nm films did not exhibit as low values as observed for the
160 nm films

<i>Prince Sharma, Purvam Mehulkumar Gandhi, Kerri-Lee Chintersingh, Mirko Schoenitz, Edward L. Dreizin, Sz-Chian Liou, Ganesh Balasubramanian</i>
<p>High-energy mechanical milling is employed to synthesize a stable
high-entropy alloy powder from an otherwise immiscible Mg-Ti rich metallic
mixture. Predictions from first principles and materials theory corroborate the
results from microscopic characterizations that reveal a transition of the
amorphous phase from a precursor intermetallic structure by antisite disorder,
lattice expansion and nanograin boundaries. This phase transformation is
accelerated by the presence of multi principal elements that induce severe
lattice distortion due to the high-configurational entropy. The atomic size
mismatch of the dissimilar elements present in the alloy produces a stable
amorphous phase that resists reverting to an ordered lattice even on annealing.

<h3>From equilibrium to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of liquids</h3>

<i>O. Joaquín-Jaime, R. Peredo-Ortiz, M. Medina-Noyola, L.F. Elizondo-Aguilera</i>
<p>Relevant and fundamental concepts of the statistical mechanical theory of
classical liquids are ordinarily introduced in the context of the description
of thermodynamic equilibrium states. This makes explicit reference to
probability distribution functions of \emph{equilibrium} statistical ensembles
(canonical, microcanonical, ...) in the derivation of general and fundamental
relations between inter-particle interactions and measurable macroscopic
properties of a given system. This includes, for instance, expressing the
internal energy and the pressure as functionals of the radial distribution
function, or writing transport coefficients (diffusion constant, linear
viscosity, ...) in terms of integral relations involving both, static and
dynamic auto-correlation functions (density-density, stress-stress, ...). Most
commonly, however, matter is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and this calls
for the extension of these relations to out-of-equilibrium conditions with the
aim of understanding, for example, the time-dependent transient states during
the process of equilibration, or the aging of glass- and gel-forming liquids
during the formation of non-equilibrium amorphous solid states. In this work we
address this issue from both, a general perspective and an illustrative
concrete application focused on the first principles description of rheological
and viscoelastic properties of glass- and gel-forming liquids.

HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+ \delta}$ with doping level $p$ = 0.1 - 0.12 in
magnetic field up to 88 T. We report for the first time in a cuprate
superconductor a dramatic change of the quantum oscillation spectrum versus
temperature, which is accompanied by a sign change of the Hall effect below $T
\approx$ 10 K. Based on numerical simulations, we infer a Fermi surface
reconstruction in the inner plane from an antiferromagnetic state (hole
pockets) to a biaxial charge density wave state (electron pockets). We show
that both orders compete and share the same hotspots of the Fermi surface and
we discuss our result in the context of spin-fermion models.

<i>Hal Tasaki</i>
<p>We consider a free fermion chain with a uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and
a macroscopic number of particles. Fix any subset of the chain. For any initial
state, we prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the
(measurement result of the) number of particles in the subset almost certainly
equals its equilibrium value (corresponding to the uniform particle
distribution). This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior in a
system governed by the quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is
conceptually important that irreversibility is proved here without introducing
any randomness to the initial state of the Hamiltonian, while the derivation of
irreversibility in classical systems relies on certain randomness. The
essential new ingredient in the proof is the justification of the strong ETH
(energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) in the large-deviation form.

<i>James MacLaurin, Moshe Silverstein, Pedro Vilanova</i>
<p>We determine limiting equations for large asymmetric `spin glass' networks.
The initial conditions are not assumed to be independent of the disordered
connectivity: one of the main motivations for this is that allows one to
understand how the structure of the limiting equations depends on the energy
landscape of the random connectivity. The method is to determine the
convergence of the double empirical measure (this yields population density
equations for the joint distribution of the spins and fields). An additional
advantage to utilizing the double empirical measure is that it yields a means
of obtaining accurate finite-dimensional approximations to the dynamics.

<h3>Isotope engineering of carrier mobility via Fröhlich electron-phonon  interaction</h3>

<br>
<i>Wenjiang Zhou, Te-Huan Liu, Bai Song</i>
<p>Isotope effects on phonon properties and transport have been predicted and
observed for decades. However, despite the crucial impact of electron-phonon
interactions, the effect of isotopes on electron transport remains largely
unexplored. Here, by using first-principles calculations, we theoretically
predict that the electron mobility of lithium hydride (LiH) can increase by up
to ~100% as $^3\rm{H}$ is replaced with $^1\rm{H}$. This remarkable phenomenon
is primarily attributed to the isotope engineering of the Fr\"ohlich
interaction by the mass-induced line shift of the longitudinal optical (LO)
phonons. Notably, the isotope-dependent absorption of LO phonons dominates
while the isotope-insensitive emission process is mostly suppressed due to
energy conservation. We further propose general guidelines for evaluating
isotope effects on carrier transport in different materials.

<h3>A smart granular intruder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15297</a>
<br>
<i>Lázaro Martínez-Ortíz, Alex Rivera-River, Ernesto Altshuler</i>
<p>It has been recently reported that irregular objects sink irregularly when
released in a granular medium: a subtle lack of symmetry in the density or
shape of a macroscopic object may produce a large tilting and deviation from
the vertical path when released from the free surface of a granular bed. This
can be inconvenient --even catastrophic-- in scenarios ranging from buildings
to space rovers. Here, we take advantage of the high sensitivity of granular
intruders to shape asymmetry: we introduce a granular intruder equipped with an
inflatable bladder that protrudes from the intruder's surface as an autonomous
response to an unwanted tilting. So, the intruder's symmetry is only slightly
manipulated, resulting in the rectification of the undesired tilting. Our smart
intruder is even able to rectify its settling path when perturbed by an
external element, like a vertical wall. The general concept introduced here can
be potentially expanded to real-life scenarios, such as ``smart foundations''
to mitigate the inclination of constructions on a partially fluidized soil.

<h3>On the origin of metal-insulator transitions in the parent compounds of  ruthenium-pnictide superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Niraj Aryal, Emil S. Bozin, Weiguo Yin</i>
<p>We study the interplay of the structural phase transition, flat electronic
band dispersion, and metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) in the parent
compounds of the Ru-pnictide superconductors by using first-principles
calculations. Our electron and phonon calculations reveal that Ru(P,As) undergo
MIT accompanied by orthorhombic to monoclinic distortion at low temperature,
but RuSb stays orthorhombic and metallic in agreement with the experimental
findings. We find that although small monoclinic distortion can remove the van
Hove singularity at the Fermi level, it does not immediately gap out the Fermi
surface and a large value of monoclinic distortion is necessary for a clear MIT
suggesting the possibility of an intermediate pseudogapped monoclinic metallic
phase. Furthermore, we predict a light-induced two-step insulator-to-metal and
structural transitions in the monoclinic phases of RuP and RuAs, which can be
tested in future ultrafast pump-probe experiments as an alternative ideal play
ground to VO$_2$.

<p>The adsorption of concentrated polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride,
PDADMAC-sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) mixtures at the water-vapor

way in which the formation of polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes in the bulk
affects the interfacial properties of mixtures formed by a polycation and an
oppositely charged surfactant. The results are discussed in terms of a two-step
adsorption-equilibration of PDADMAC-SLES complexes at the interface, with the
initial stages involving the diffusion of kinetically trapped aggregates formed
in the bulk to the interface followed by the dissociation and spreading of such
aggregates at the interface. This latter process becomes the main contribution
to the surface tension decrease. This work aids our understanding of the most
fundamental basis of the physicochemical behavior of concentrated
polyelectrolyte-surfactant mixtures which present complex bulk and interfacial
interactions with interest in both basic and applied sciences.

<p>The adsorption of mixtures of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
(PDADMAC) and sodium N-lauroyl-N-methyltaurate (SLMT) at the water / vapor
interface has been studied using drop profile tensiometry and neutron
reflectometry. This study sheds light on the mechanisms involved in the
adsorption of polyelectrolyte-oppositely charged surfactants by the
characterization of both equilibrium and dynamics features associated with the
layer formation at the fluid interface. The results are discussed in terms of
an adsorption-equilibration of the interfacial layers as a two-step process:
the initial stages involve the adsorption of polyelectrolyte-surfactant
complexes formed in the bulk, and a subsequent stage involves reorganization of
the interface. This work contributes to the understanding of the
physico-chemical features of systems that undergo complex bulk and interfacial
interactions with importance in science and technology.

<h3>Physico-chemical study of polymer mixtures formed by a polycation and a  zwitterionic copolymer in aqueous solution and upon adsorption onto  negatively charged surfaces</h3>

<p>The adsorption of mixtures of charged polymers onto solid surfaces presents a
big interest in different technological and industrial fields, and in
particular, in cosmetics. This requires to deepen on the most fundamental
physico-chemical bases governing the deposition, which is generally correlated
to the interactions occurring in solution. This work explores the interaction
in solution of model polymer mixtures formed by a cationic homopolymer
(poly(diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride), PDADMAC) and a zwitterionic
copolymer (copolymer of acrylic acid, 3-Trimethylammonium propyl methacrylamide
chloride and acrylamide, Merquat 2003), and the adsorption of such mixtures
onto negatively charged surfaces. The analysis of the interactions occurring in
solution between both polymers performed using dynamic light scattering (DLS),
electrophoretic mobility and viscosity measurements, combined with the study of
the deposition of the layers of mixtures containing different weight fractions
of each polymer using ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance with
dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) has shown that the interpolymer complexes formed
in solution, and their composition, governs the deposition onto the solid
surface and the tribological properties of the adsorbed layers as shown the
Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) experiments, allowing for a control of the
physico-chemical properties and structure of the layers. Furthermore, the use
of Self Consistent Mean Fields Calculations (SCF) confirms the picture obtained
from the experimental studies of the adsorbed layers, providing a prediction of
the distribution of the polymer chains within the adsorbed layers. It is
expected that this study can help on the understanding of the correlations
existing between the behavior of future associations of innovative and
eco-sustainable polymers and their adsorption processes onto solid surface.

<h3>Suppression of Bogoliubov momentum pairing and emergence of non-Gaussian  correlations in ultracold interacting Bose gases</h3>

<p>Strongly correlated quantum matter -- such as interacting electron systems or
interacting quantum fluids -- possesses properties that cannot be understood in
terms of linear fluctuations and free quasi-particles. Quantum fluctuations in
these systems are indeed large and generically exhibit non-Gaussian statistics
-- a property captured only by inspecting high-order correlations, whose
quantitative reconstruction poses a formidable challenge to both experiments
and theory alike. A prime example of correlated quantum matter is the strongly
interacting Bose fluid, realized by superfluid Helium and, more recently,
ultra-cold atoms. Here, we experimentally study interacting Bose gases from the
weakly to the strongly interacting regime through single-atom-resolved
correlations in momentum space. We observe that the Bogoliubov pairing among
modes of opposite momenta, emblematic of the weakly interacting regime, is
suppressed as interactions become stronger. This departure from the predictions
of Bogoliubov theory signals the onset of the strongly correlated regime, as
confirmed by numerical simulations that highlight the role of non-linear
quantum fluctuations in our system. Additionally, our measurements unveil a
non-zero four-operator cumulant at even stronger interactions, which is a
direct signature of non-Gaussian correlations. These results shed light on the
emergence and physical origin of non-Gaussian correlations in ensembles of
interacting bosons.

<h3>Observation of an Abrupt 3D-2D Morphological Transition in Thin Al  Layers Grown by MBE on InGaAs surface</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Elbaroudy, B. Khromets, F. Sfigakis, E. Bergeron, Y. Shi, M.C.A. Tam, T. Blaikie, George Nichols, J. Baugh, Z. R. Wasilewski</i>
<p>Among superconductor/semiconductor hybrid structures, in-situ aluminum (Al)
grown on InGaAs/InAs is widely pursued for the experimental realization of
Majorana Zero Mode quasiparticles. This is due to the high carrier mobility,
low effective mass, and large Land\'e g-factor of InAs, coupled with the
relatively high value of the in-plane critical magnetic field in thin Al films.
However, growing a thin, continuous Al layer using the Molecular Beam Epitaxy
(MBE) is challenging due to aluminum's high surface mobility and tendency for
3D nucleation on semiconductor surfaces. A study of epitaxial Al thin film
growth on In0.75Ga0.25As with MBE is presented, focusing on the effects of the
Al growth rate and substrate temperature on the nucleation of Al layers. We
find that for low deposition rates, 0.1 {\AA}/s and 0.5 {\AA}/s, the growth
continues in 3D mode during the deposition of the nominal 100 {\AA} of Al,
resulting in isolated Al islands. However, for growth rates of 1.5 {\AA}/s and
above, the 3D growth mode quickly transitions into island coalescence, leading
to a uniform 2D Al layer. Moreover, this transition is very abrupt, happening
over an Al flux increase of less than 1%. We discuss the growth mechanisms
explaining these observations. The results give new insights into the kinetics
of Al deposition and show that with sufficiently high Al flux, a 2D growth on
substrates at close to room temperature can be achieved already within the
first few Al monolayers. This eliminates the need for complex cryogenic
substrate cooling and paves the way for the development of high-quality
superconductor-semiconductor interfaces in standard MBE systems.

<h3>Soft spots of net negative topological charge directly cause the  plasticity of 3D glasses</h3>

<br>
<i>Arabinda Bera, Matteo Baggioli, Timothy C. Petersen, Timothy W. Sirk, Amelia C. Y. Liu, Alessio Zaccone</i>
<p>The deformation mechanism in amorphous solids subjected to external shear
remains poorly understood because of the absence of well-defined topological
defects mediating the plastic deformation. The notion of soft spots has emerged
as a useful tool to characterize the onset of irreversible rearrangements and
plastic flow, but these entities are not well-defined in terms of geometry and
topology. In this study, we unveil the phenomenology of recently discovered,
well-defined topological defects governing the microscopic mechanical and
yielding behavior of a model 3D glass under shear deformation. We identify the
existence of vortex-like and anti-vortex-like topological defects within the 3D
non-affine displacement field. The number density of these defects exhibits a
significant (inverse) correlation with the plastic events, with defect
proliferation-annihilation cycles matching the alternation of elastic-like
segments and catastrophic plastic drops, respectively. Furthermore, we observe
collective annihilation of these point-like defects via plastic events, with
large local topological charge fluctuations in the vicinity of regions that
feature strong non-affine displacements. We unveil that plastic yielding is
driven by very few, but very large, clusters of net negative topological
charge, the massive annihilation of which triggers the onset of plastic flow.
These findings suggest a geometric and topological characterization of soft
spots and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of topological defects
as mediators of plastic deformation in glassy materials.

<i>Andrei V. Nikitin, Dmitry A. Zezyulin</i>
<p>We present a theoretical study of an exciton-polariton annular microcavity
with an additional quasiperiodic structure along the ring which is implemented
in the form of a bicosine dependence. We demonstrate that for a sufficiently
strong quasiperiodic modulation, the microcavity features a sharp mobility edge
separating a cluster of localized states from the rest of the spectrum
consisting of states extended over the whole ring. Localized modes can be
excited using a resonant pump whose topological charge determines the phase
distribution of excited patterns. Repulsive polariton interactions make the
resonance peaks distinctively asymmetric and enable the formation of
multistable states which feature the attractor-like dynamical behavior \rev{and
hysteresis}. We also demonstrate that the localized states can be realized in a
biannular cavity that consists of two rings, each having periodic modulation,
such that the periods of two modulations are different.

<h3>Electrochemical characterization of a Fe-based shape memory alloy in an  alkaline medium and the behaviour in aggressive conditions</h3>

<i>A. Collazo, R. Figueroa, C. Mariño-Martínez, X.R. Nóvoa, C. Pérez</i>
<p>A Fe-17Mn-6Si-19Cr-4Ni-1(V,C) shape memory steel (SMS) was characterised
electrochemically in its unstrained and pre-strained conditions. The work
focused on analysing the passive films generated in alkaline conditions, and on
the behaviour of those passive samples in various Cl/OH ratios. The passive
films were developed by cyclic voltammetry and their characterisation was
performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); these tests were also carried out in 304 L
stainless steel specimens for comparison purposes. The results indicated that
the film characteristics (thickness and composition) were similar in all the
samples, although higher corrosion resistance was observed in the 304 L due to
the higher Cr content. In addition, the behaviour of the passive samples in
aggressive conditions was assessed by potentiodynamic measurements. The results
stated that the shape memory steels were more sensitive than the stainless
steel to the aggressive conditions, especially when the alloy was pre-strained.
It was also observed that the SMS exhibited a characteristic corrosion
morphology localized at the grain boundaries.

<i>A. Collazo, B. Díaz, R. Figueroa, X.R. Nóvoa, C. Pérez</i>
<p>The present work reports the effect of adding Graphene Oxide (GO) and reduced
Graphene Oxide (rGO) in the corrosion protection provided by a water-borne
resin applied on a galvanized steel substrate. Three concentrations, 0.05, 0.1
and 0.15 (all wt%) were tested. The results were markedly affected not only by
the concentration of particles but also by their nature. Although the zeta
potential values suggested good dispersibility of the particles in the resin,
certain aggregation was observed, mainly in rGO 0.1 wt% and rGO 0.15 wt%
formulations. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique
characterised the free films' transport properties. The results suggested that
the aggregation strongly influenced the film morphology. The rGO 0.1 wt% and
rGO 0.15 wt% formulations exhibited percolating pores that facilitated the
electrolyte uptake through the films. The EIS technique was also used to study
the protective performance of the films when applied to the metallic substrate.
The results confirmed the harmful effect of the particle's aggregation. The
results were interesting for the rGO 0.05 wt% system, which displayed
long-lasting protection properties. This performance was explained considering
its good barrier properties and the zinc surface passivation by the generation
of zincite, ZnO.

<i>Madhav Sharma, Rajendra S. Dhaka</i>
<p>The efficient energy storage devices are crucial to meet the soaring global
energy demand for sustainable future. Recently, the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)
have emerged as one of the excellent cost effective solution due to the uniform
geographical distribution and abundance of sodium. Here, we use hard carbon
(HC) as an anode and Na$_3$V$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C (NVP/C) as a cathode to
fabricate a HC$||$NVP/C full cell battery and understand its electrochemical
performance and diffusion kinetics. These materials are characterized through
the analysis of x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy to confirm their
single phase and structure. The full cell demonstrates a high operating voltage
of $\sim$3.3 V, with minimal polarization of 0.05 V, attributed to the lower
working voltage of the HC. Interestingly, for the full cell battery we find the
specific capacity of around 70 mAh/g at 0.1 C and even around 35 mAh/g at high
current rate of 5 C along with high rate capability up to 55 cycles. The
diffusion kinetics of the full cell battery is investigated through detailed
analysis of CV curves at various scan rates, and the diffusion coefficient is
found to be 5--8$\times$10$^{-11}$ cm$^2$/s for the anodic as well as cathodic
peaks.

<h3>Interplay of altermagnetism and weak ferromagnetism in two-dimensional  RuF$_4$</h3>

<p>Gaining growing attention in spintronics is a class of magnets displaying
zero net magnetization and spin-split electronic bands called altermagnets.
Here, by combining density functional theory and symmetry analysis, we show
that RuF$_4$ monolayer is a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. Spin-orbit
coupling leads to pronounced spin splitting of the electronic bands at the
$\Gamma$ point by $\sim 100$ meV and turns the RuF$_4$ into a weak ferromagnet
due to non trivial spin-momentum locking that cants the Ru magnetic moments.
The net magnetic moment scales linearly with the spin-orbit coupling strength.
Using group theory we derive an effective spin Hamiltonian capturing the
spin-splitting and spin-momentum locking of the electronic bands.
Disentanglement of the altermagnetic and spin-orbit coupling induced spin
splitting uncovers to which extent the altermagnetic properties are affected by
the spin-orbit coupling. Our results move the spotlight to the non trivial
spin-momentum locking and weak ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional
altermagnets relevant for novel venues in this emerging field of material
science research.

<p>The sub-nanometer distance between tip and sample in a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) enables the application of very large electric fields with a
strength as high as ~ 1 GV/m. This has allowed for efficient electrical driving
of Rabi oscillations of a single spin on a surface at a moderate
radio-frequency (RF) voltage of the order of tens of millivolts. Here, we
demonstrate the creation of dressed states of a single electron spin localized
in the STM tunnel junction by using resonant RF driving voltages. The read-out
of these dressed states was achieved all-electrical by a weakly coupled probe
spin. Our work highlights the strength of the atomic-scale geometry inherent to
the STM that facilitates creation and control of dressed states, which are
promising for a design of atomically well-defined single spin quantum devices
on surfaces.

<p>We grew needle-shaped single crystals of GdAgGe, which crystallizes in a
noncentrosymmetric hexagonal crystal structure with space group
P$\overline{6}$2$m$ (189). The magnetic susceptibility data for $H \perp c$
reveal two pronounced antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}$ = 20 K and
$T_{N2}$ = 14.5 K. The magnetic susceptibility anomalies are less prominent for
$H \parallel c$. The transition at $T_{N1}$ is accompanied by a pronounced heat
capacity anomaly confirming the bulk nature of the magnetic transition. Below
$T_{N1}$, the electrical resistivity data follows a $T^{3/2}$ dependence. In
the magnetically ordered state, GdAgGe shows positive transverse
magnetoresistance, which increases with decreasing temperature and increasing
field, reaching a value of $\sim$ 27% at 9 T and 10 K. The Hall resistivity
data and electronic band structure calculations suggest that both the hole and
electron charge carriers contribute to the transport properties. The electronic
band structure displays linear band crossings near the Fermi level. The
calculations reveal that GdAgGe has a nodal line with drumhead surface states
coupled with a nonzero Berry phase, making it a nontrivial nodal-line

<h3>Nonlocal Fermions with Local Interactions and the SYK Model</h3>

<br>
<i>G. C. Levine</i>
<p>One of the most promising routes to non-fermi liquids and strange metals has
been through SYK models \cite{Sachdev:2010um}, which necessarily involve large
flavor degrees of freedom and interactions with imposed disorder. We introduce
an interacting model of nonlocal spinless fermions in which large flavor and
effective disorder emerge spontaneously in the extreme nonlocal limit. This
model may be thought of as an expansion in a dimensionless "locality scale,"
$\alpha$, with the limit $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ recovering a conventional local
action. For finite $\alpha$, the resulting interacting nonlocal action exhibits
a large number of low-energy degrees of freedom -- proportional to $\alpha$ --
and the structure factor mediating the local interactions between these
fermions is effectively random for large $\alpha$. In one dimension, with
finite $\alpha$, we show that interactions are marginal to the one loop level
(as they are in the conventional local case), preserving a gapless phase. At
large $\alpha$ the interaction strength becomes comparable to the bandwidth and
we analyze this large flavor limit in a manner similar to the diagrammatic
approach to SYK. As $\alpha$ is increased we argue that the gapless phase
established by conventional RG possibly crosses over to a gapless SYK phase,
although the "melon" diagrams are not exclusively dominant. We speculate on how
this model might arise physically from an S-matrix connecting pure excited
states -- rather than the vacuum -- to access finite temperature interacting
fermions.

<p>Spintronic logic devices require efficient spin-charge interconversion:
converting charge current to spin current and spin current to charge current.
In spin-orbit materials that are regarded as the most promising candidate for
spintronic logic devices, one mechanism that is responsible for spin-charge
interconversion is Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects based on
spin-momentum locking in materials with Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Over
last decade, there has been rapid progresses for increasing interconversion
efficiencies due to the Edelstein effect in a few Rashba-Dresselhaus materials
and topological insulators, making Rashba spin-momentum locking a promising
technological solution for spin-orbit logic devices. However, despite the rapid
progress that leads to high spin-charge interconversion efficiency at cryogenic
temperatures, the room-temperature efficiency needed for technological
applications is still low. This paper presents our understanding on the
challenges and opportunities in searching for Rashba-Dresselhaus materials for
efficient spin-charge interconversion at room temperature by focusing on
materials properties such as Rashba coefficients, momentum relaxation times,
spin-momentum locking relations and electrical conductivities.

<br>
<i>Letian Yu, Haoran Xue, Ruixiang Guo, Eng Aik Chan, Yun Yong Terh, Cesare Soci, Baile Zhang, Y. D. Chong</i>
<p>Mass is commonly regarded as an intrinsic property of matter, but modern
physics shows that particle masses have complex origins . Elementary particles
acquire mass from couplings to other fields: most fermions and bosons receive
mass from the Higgs field, as well as other interactions (e.g., quarks gain
mass from interactions with gluons). In low-energy physics, quasiparticles
behaving like fundamental particles can arise in crystalline lattices, such as
relativistic Dirac quasiparticles in graphene. Mass can be imparted to these
quasiparticles by various lattice perturbations. By tailoring lattice
properties, we can explore otherwise-inacessible phenomena, such as how
particles behave when Hermiticity, the symmetry responsible for energy
conservation, is violated. Non-Hermiticity has long seemed incompatible with
mass generation; when Dirac points are subjected to energy-nonconserving
perturbations, they typically become exceptional points instead of opening a
mass gap. Here, we show experimentally that Dirac masses can be generated via
non-Hermiticity. We implement a photonic synthetic lattice with gain and loss
engineered to produce Dirac quasiparticles with real mass. By tuning this mass,
we demonstrate a crossover from conical to non-conical diffraction ,
topological boundary states between domains of opposite Dirac mass, and
anomalous tunneling into potential barriers.

<p>The magnetic interactions in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Dirac semimetal
candidate SrMnSb$_2$ are investigated using \textit{ab initio} linear response
theory and inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Our calculations reveal that the
first two nearest in-plane couplings ($J_1$ and $J_2$) are both AFM in nature,
indicating a significant degree of spin frustration, which aligns with
experimental observations. The orbital resolution of exchange interactions
shows that $J_1$ and $J_2$ are dominated by direct and superexchange,
respectively. In a broader context, a rigid-band model suggests that electron
doping fills the minority spin channel and results in a decrease in the AFM
coupling strength for both $J_1$ and $J_2$. To better compare with INS
experiments, we calculate the spin wave spectra within a linear spin wave
theory framework, utilizing the computed exchange parameters. The calculated
spin wave spectra exhibit overall good agreement with measurements from INS
experiments, although with a larger magnon bandwidth. Introducing additional
electron correlation within the Mn-$3d$ orbitals can promote electron
localization and reduce the magnetic coupling, further improving the agreement
with experiments.

<i>Dawei Zhoua, Zhuo Wangb, Pan Zhanga, Chunying Pua</i>
<p>Inspired by recent experimental synthesis of the two-dimensional Janus
material MoSH, we performed extensive first-principles calculations to
investigate the characteristics of all possible Janus two-dimensional
transition metal hydrosulfides (JTMSHs) in both the 2H and 1T phases. Our
investigations revealed that the JTMSHs can form a unique family of
two-dimensional materials with novel physical and chemical properties. We found
that JTMSHs can exist in different crystal states, exhibiting metallic,
semiconducting, and magnetic behaviors. One particularly intriguing finding is
the identification of two-dimensional electrodes with distinct bonding
characteristics in the 2H-JTMSHs (TM=V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W and Tc). Additionally, we
observed evidence of charge density wave (CDW) materials in 1T-JTMSH (TM=Tc,
Re, and W) and 2H-JTMSH (TM = Tc). Importantly, by applying a compressive
strain to these materials, the CDW can be completely suppressed and
superconductivities is hence induced. Specially, we shown that when subjected
to a compressive strain within 10%, the superconducting transition temperature
(Tc) of 1T-WSH, 1T-TcSH and 2H-TcSH can achieve maximum values of 13.8, 16.2
and 24.2 K respectively. Additionally, our investigation also unveiled two
intrinsic phonon-mediated superconductors 2H-WSH and 1T-RuSH with Tc of 17.0 K
and 8K, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrate that the family of
two-dimensional JTMSHs is full of surprises and holds great potential for

<i>Yu-Xin Wu, Jin-Fu Chen, H. T. Quan</i>
<p>The theory of equilibrium phase transition, which traditionally does not
involve time evolution, concerns only static quantities. In recent decades,
owing to the development of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, there is a growing
interest in nonequilibrium phase transition which concerns time evolution. It
is well-known that in the absence of phase transitions, the excess work
resulted from finite-rate quench is proportional to the quench rate v. The time
evolution in a second-order phase transition can be understood via the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and the scaling of work is related to the critical
exponents. Nevertheless, the finite-time nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the
first-order phase transition remains largely unexplored. We investigate the
scaling relations of some thermodynamic quantities with the quench rate in the
first-order phase transition. It is shown that the excess work scales as
$v^{2/3}$ for small quench rate. Moreover, the delay time and the transition
time scale as $v^{1/3}$. Our study deepens the understanding about the
nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the first-order phase transition.

<i>José Ángel Castellanos-Reyes, Paul Zeiger, Ján Rusz</i>
<p>We present a method for computing angle-resolved electron-energy-loss and
gain spectroscopies for phonon and magnon excitations in transmission electron
microscopy. Fractional scattering intensities are derived from the
temperature-dependent time auto-correlation of the electron beam wave function.
This method captures both single and multiple scattering processes, as well as
dynamical diffraction effects. Our method remains computationally efficient,
and it is easy to parallelize.

<h3>In-plane Antiferromagnetism in Ferromagnetic Kagome Semimetal Co3Sn2S2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15602</a>
<br>
<i>Sandy Adhitia Ekahana, Satoshi Okamoto, Jan Dreiser, Loïc Roduit, Gawryluk Dariusz Jakub, Andrew Hunter, Anna Tamai, Y. Soh</i>
<p>Co3Sn2S2 has been reported to be a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal
symmetry with c axis ferromagnetism (FM) below a Curie temperature of 177 K.
Despite the large interest in Co3Sn2S2, the magnetic structure is still under
debate and recent studies have challenged our understanding of the magnetic
phase diagram of Co3Sn2S2 by reporting unusual magnetic phases including the
presence of exchange bias. Understanding the magnetism of Co3Sn2S2 is important
since its electronic band structure including the much-celebrated flat bands
and Weyl nodes depend on the magnetic phase. In this work, using X-ray Magnetic
Circular Dichroism (XMCD), we establish that the magnetic moment in Co arises
from the spin, with negligible orbital moment. In addition, we detect an
in-plane AFM minority phase in the sea of a FM phase using spatially-resolved
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES) combined with density
functional theory (DFT) calculation. Separately, we detect a sharp flat band
precisely at the Fermi level (EF) at some regions in the sample, which we
attribute to a surface state. The AFM phase survives even to the low
temperature of 6 K. This example of entirely different magnetic ground states
in a stoichiometric intermetallic invites further efforts to explore the
observed AFM phase and understand the origin and nature of the magnetic and
electronic inhomogeneity on the mesoscale and the interface between the AFM and
FM phases.

<h3>Red shift of the superconductivity cavity resonance in Josephson  junction qubits as a direct signature of TLS population inversion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15624" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15624</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander L. Burin, Moshe Schechter, Daniel Tennant, Yaniv J. Rosen</i>
<p>Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) limit the performance of superconducting
qubits and superconducting and optomechanical resonators breaking down the
coherence and absorbing the energy of oscillations. TLS absorption can be
suppressed or even switched to the gain regime by inverting TLS populations.
Here we theoretically explore the regime where the full inversion of TLS
populations is attained at energies below a pump field quantization energy by
simultaneously applying the pump field and the time varying bias. This regime
is attained changing the bias sufficiently slowly to fully invert TLS
populations when their energies cross resonance with the pump field and
sufficiently fast to avoid TLS relaxation between two resonance crossing
events. This population inversion is accompanied by a significant red shift of
cavity resonance due to quantum level repulsion. The red-shift in frequency
serves as a signature of the population inversion, as its re-entrant behavior
as function of bias sweep rate and of the magnitude of the pump field allows
the determination of the TLSs dipole moment and relaxation time. The predicted
behavior is qualitatively consistent with the recent experimental observations
in Al superconducting resonators.

<p>We investigate dense suspensions of swimming bacteria prepared in a
nutrient-exchange chamber. Near the pellet concentration, nonthermal
fluctuations showed notable agreement between self and collective behaviors, a
phenomenon not previously observed at equilibrium. The viscosity of active
suspensions dramatically decreased compared to their inactive counterparts,
where glassy features, such as non-Newtonian viscosity and dynamic
heterogeneity, disappeared. Instead, the complex shear modulus showed a
power-law rheology,$G^*(\omega)\propto\left(-i\omega\right)^\frac{1}{2}$,
indicating the role of bacterial activity in driving the system towards a
critical jamming state.

<br>
<i>Peng Peng, Yuchen Peng, Aoqian Shi, Xiaogen Yi, Yizhou Wei, Jianjun Liu</i>
<p>The Moir\'e patterns generated by altering the structural parameters in a two
or more layers of periodic materials, including single-layer structure,
interlayer stacking, and twisting parameters, exhibit prosperous topological
physical properties. However, the intricate characteristics of these Moir\'e
patterns and their relationship with topological transitions remain unclear. In
this Letter, based on the proposed twisted nested photonic crystal (TNPC), we
derive its spatial geometric functions (SGFs), aperiodic-quasiperiodic-periodic
characteristics of Moir\'e patterns, and the SSH{\phi} Hamiltonian. We reveal
the intrinsic correlation between Moir\'e patterns and topological transitions,
obtaining higher-order topological states (HOTSs) with C2z symmetry. This work
will provide theoretical references for the design and application of twisted
topological PC and their devices.

<h3>Topological magnon-polarons in honeycomb antiferromagnets with spin-flop  transition</h3>

<br>
<i>Gyungchoon Go, Heejun Yang, Je-Geun Park, Se Kwon Kim</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the thermal Hall transport of magnon-polarons in
a two-dimensional honeycomb antiferromagnetic insulator under the influence of
a perpendicular magnetic field, varying in strength. The application of a
perpendicular magnetic field induces a magnetic phase transition from the
collinear antiferromagnetic phase to the spin-flop phase, leading to a
significant alteration in Hall transport across the transition point. In this
paper, our focus is on the intrinsic contribution to thermal Hall transport
arising from the magnetoelastic interaction. To facilitate experimental
verification of our theoretical results, we present the dependence of thermal
Hall conductivity on magnetic field strength and temperature.

<h3>Fast renormalizing the structures and dynamics of ultra-large systems  via random renormalization group</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15899" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15899</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Tian, Yizhou Xu, Pei Sun</i>
<p>Criticality and symmetry, studied by the renormalization groups, lie at the
heart of modern physics theories of matters and complex systems. However,
surveying these properties with massive experimental data is bottlenecked by
the intolerable costs of computing renormalization groups on real systems.
Here, we develop a time- and memory-efficient framework, termed as the random
renormalization group, for renormalizing ultra-large systems (e.g., with
millions of units) within minutes. This framework is based on random
projections, hashing techniques, and kernel representations, which support the
renormalization governed by linear and non-linear correlations. For system
structures, it exploits the correlations among local topology in kernel spaces
to unfold the connectivity of units, identify intrinsic system scales, and
verify the existences of symmetries under scale transformation. For system
dynamics, it renormalizes units into correlated clusters to analyze scaling
behaviours, validate scaling relations, and investigate potential criticality.
Benefiting from hashing-function-based designs, our framework significantly
reduces computational complexity compared with classic renormalization groups,
realizing a single-step acceleration of two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the
efficient representation of different kinds of correlations in kernel spaces
realized by random projections ensures the capacity of our framework to capture
diverse unit relations. As shown by our experiments, the random renormalization
group helps identify non-equilibrium phase transitions, criticality, and
symmetry in diverse large-scale genetic, neural, material, social, and
cosmological systems.

<h3>Magnetic, thermodynamic, and magnetotransport properties of CeGaGe and  PrGaGe single crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15907" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15907</a>
<br>
<i>Daloo Ram, Sudip Malick, Zakir Hossain, Dariusz Kaczorowski</i>
<p>We investigate the physical properties of high-quality single crystals CeGaGe
and PrGaGe using magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetotransport
measurements. Gallium-indium binary flux was used to grow these single crystals
that crystallize in a body-centered tetragonal structure. Magnetic
susceptibility data reveal a magnetic phase transition around 6.0 and 19.4 K in
CeGaGe and PrGaGe, respectively, which is further confirmed by heat capacity
and electrical resistivity data. A number of additional anomalies have been
observed below the ordering temperature in the magnetic susceptibility data,
indicating a complex magnetic structure. The magnetic measurements also reveal
a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy in both compounds. Our detailed analysis
of the crystalline electric field (CEF) effect as observed in magnetic
susceptibility and heat capacity data suggests that the $J$ = 5/2 multiplet of
CeGaGe splits into three doublets, while the $J$ = 4 degenerate ground state of
PrGaGe splits into five singlets and two doublets. The estimated energy levels
from the CEF analysis are consistent with the magnetic entropy.

<h3>Accurate detection of diffusion anisotropy from an individual short  particle trajectory</h3>

<br>
<i>Kaito Takanami, Daisuke Taniguchi, Sawako Enoki, Masafumi Kuroda, Yasushi Okada, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</i>
<p>In parallel with advances in microscale imaging techniques, the fields of
biology and materials science have focused on precisely extracting particle
properties based on their diffusion behavior. Although the majority of
real-world particles exhibit anisotropy, their behavior has been studied less
than that of isotropic particles. In this study, we introduce a new method for
estimating the diffusion coefficients of individual anisotropic particles using
short-trajectory data on the basis of a maximum likelihood framework.
Traditional estimation techniques often use mean-squared displacement (MSD)
values or other statistical measures that inherently remove angular
information. Instead, we treated the angle as a latent variable and used belief
propagation to estimate it while maximizing the likelihood using the
expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared to conventional methods, this
approach facilitates better estimation of shorter trajectories and faster
rotations, as confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental data
involving bacteria and quantum rods. Additionally, we performed an analytical
investigation of the limits of detectability of anisotropy and provided
guidelines for the experimental design. In addition to serving as a powerful
tool for analyzing complex systems, the proposed method will pave the way for
applying maximum likelihood methods to more complex diffusion phenomena.

<p>Vortices and bound states offer an effective means of comprehending the
electronic properties of superconductors. Recently, surface dependent vortex
core states have been observed in the newly discovered kagome superconductors
CsV3Sb5. Although the spatial distribution of the sharp zero energy conductance
peak appears similar to Majorana bound states arising from the superconducting
Dirac surface states, its origin remains elusive. In this study, we present
observations of tunable vortex bound states (VBSs) in two chemically doped
kagome superconductors Cs(V1-xTrx)3Sb5 (Tr=Ta or Ti), using low temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The CsV3Sb5-derived kagome
superconductors exhibit full gap pairing superconductivity accompanied by the
absence of long range charge orders, in contrast to pristine CsV3Sb5. Zero
energy conductance maps demonstrate a field-driven continuous reorientation
transition of the vortex lattice, suggesting multiband superconductivity. The
Ta doped CsV3Sb5 displays the conventional cross shaped spatial evolution of
Caroli de Gennes Matricon bound states, while the Ti doped CsV3Sb5 exhibits a
sharp, non split zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) that persists over a long
distance across the vortex. The spatial evolution of the non split ZBCP is
robust against surface effects and external magnetic field but is related to
the doping concentrations. Our study reveals the tunable VBSs in multiband
chemically doped CsV3Sb5 system and offers fresh insights into previously
reported Y shaped ZBCP in a non quantum limit condition at the surface of
kagome superconductor.

<h3>Generalized Algorithm for Recognition of Complex Point Defects in  Large-Scale β-$\rm {Ga_2O_3}$</h3>

<br>
<i>Mengzhi Yan, Junlei Zhao, Flyura Djurabekova, Zongwei Xu</i>
<p>The electrical and optical properties of semiconductor materials are
profoundly influenced by the atomic configurations and concentrations of
intrinsic defects. This influence is particularly significant in the case of
$\beta$-$\rm {Ga_2O_3}$, a vital ultrawide bandgap semiconductor characterized
by highly complex intrinsic defect configurations. Despite its importance,
there is a notable absence of an accurate method to recognize these defects in
large-scale atomistic computational modeling. In this work, we present an
effective algorithm designed explicitly for identifying various intrinsic point
defects in the $\beta$-$\rm {Ga_2O_3}$ lattice. By integrating particle swarm
optimization and hierarchical clustering methods, our algorithm attains a
recognition accuracy exceeding 95% for discrete point defect configurations.
Furthermore, we have developed an efficient technique for randomly generating
diverse intrinsic defects in large-scale $\beta$-$\rm {Ga_2O_3}$ systems. This
approach facilitates the construction of an extensive atomic database,
crucially instrumental in validating the recognition algorithm through a
substantial number of statistical analyses. Finally, the recognition algorithm
is applied to a molecular dynamics simulation, accurately describing the
evolution of the point defects during high-temperature annealing. Our work
provides a useful tool for investigating the complex dynamical evolution of
intrinsic point defects in $\beta$-$\rm {Ga_2O_3}$, and moreover, holds promise
for understanding similar material systems, such as $\rm {Al_2O_3}$, $\rm
{In_2O_3}$, and $\rm {Sb_2O_3}$.

<h3>Increasing the Collection Efficiency in Selenium Thin-Film Solar Cells  Using a Closed-Space Annealing Strategy</h3>

<p>Elemental selenium is a promising wide-bandgap ($E_\mathrm{G}\approx$ 1.95
eV) photovoltaic material for the next generation of thin-film solar cells. To
realize high-efficiency selenium solar cells, it is crucial to optimize the
crystallization process of the selenium thin-film photoabsorber. However, the
high vapor pressure of selenium restricts the processing conditions to a
compromise between the growth of large crystal grains and the formation of
pinholes. In this study, we introduce a closed-space annealing (CSA) strategy
designed to suppress the sublimation of selenium, enabling thermal annealing
processes at higher temperatures and for longer periods of time. As a result,
we consistently improve carrier collection and the overall photovoltaic device
performance in our selenium solar cells. By characterizing the carrier dynamics
in our devices, we conclude that the observed improvements result from a
reduction in charge transfer resistance rather than an increase in carrier
diffusion length. The CSA strategy is a promising method for controlling
surface morphology and roughness without reducing crystal grain sizes, which
paves the way for further advancements in the efficiency and reproducibility of
selenium thin-film solar cells.

<p>Since their discovery, the infinite-layer nickelates have been regarded as an
appealing system for gaining deeper insights into high temperature
superconductivity (HTSC). However, the synthesis of superconducting samples has
been proved to be challenging. Here, we develop an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
${\mathrm{\textit{in situ}}}$ reduction method using atomic hydrogen as
reducing agent and apply it in lanthanum nickelate system. The reduction
parameters, including the reduction temperature (${\mathrm{\textit{T}_{R}}}$)
and hydrogen pressure (${\mathrm{\textit{P}_{H}}}$), are systematically
explored. We found that the reduction window for achieving superconducting
transition is quite wide, reaching nearly 80$^\circ$C in
${\mathrm{\textit{T}_{R}}}$ and 3 orders of magnitude in
${\mathrm{\textit{P}_{H}}}$ when the reduction time is set to 30 mins. And
there exists an optimal ${\mathrm{\textit{P}_{H}}}$ for achieving the highest
${\mathrm{\textit{T}_{c}}}$ if both ${\mathrm{\textit{T}_{R}}}$ and reduction
time are fixed. More prominently, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and
scanning transmission electron microscopy, the atomically flat surface can be
preserved during the ${\mathrm{\textit{in situ}}}$ reduction process, providing
advantages over the ${\mathrm{\textit{ex situ}}}$ CaH$_2$ method for
surface-sensitive experiments.

<p>The observation of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has
attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for
exploring high $ \mathrm{\textit{T}}_{c} $ superconductivity. However, thus
far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which
limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to
two-dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain
tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating
superconducting nickelates from the as-grown substrate is a novel way to
engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, we
report the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding $
\mathrm{La}_{0.8}\mathrm{Sr}_{0.2}\mathrm{Ni}\mathrm{O}_{2} $ membranes ($
\mathrm{\textit{T}}_{c}\mathrm{=}\mathrm{10.9}\;\mathrm{K} $), emphasizing the
crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth
and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. Our work offers
a new versatile platform for investigating the superconductivity in nickelates,
such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and
higher $ \mathrm{\textit{T}}_{c} $ values via high-pressure experiments.

<h3>Measurement of the Chern Number for Non-Hermitian Chern Insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>Hongfang Liu, Ming Lu, Shengdu Chai, Zhi-Qiang Zhang, Hua Jiang</i>
<p>The identification of the topological invariant of a topological system is
crucial in experiments. However, due to the inherent non-Hermitian features,
such determination is notably challenging in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we
propose that the magnetic effect can be utilized to measure the Chern number of
the non-Hermitian Chern insulator. We find that the splitting of non-Hermitian
bands under the magnetic field is Chern number dependent. Consequently, one can
easily identify the Chern number by analyzing these splitting sub-bands. From
the experimental perspective, the measurement of non-Hermitian bands is
demonstrated in LC electric circuits. Furthermore, we find that the
non-Hermiticity can drive open (closed) orbits of sub-bands in the Hermitian
limit closed (open), which can also be identified by our proposal. These
phenomena highlight the distinctive capabilities of non-Hermitian systems. Our
results facilitate the detection of Chern numbers for non-Hermitian systems and
may motivate further studies of their topological properties.

<p>In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial
importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for

algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to
the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between
spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then
demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern
of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.

<i>M. A. Toloza Sandoval, A. L. Araújo, F. Crasto de Lima, A. Fazzio</i>
<p>In recent years, synthesis and experimental research of fractalized materials
has evolved in a paradigmatic crossover with topological phases of matter. We
present here a theoretical investigation of the helical edge transport in
Sierpinski carpets (SCs), combining the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model and
the Landauer approach. Starting from a pristine two-dimensional topological
insulator (2DTI), according to the BHZ model, our results reveal resonant
transport modes when the SC fractal generation reaches the same scale as the
space discretization; these modes are analyzed within a contour plot mapping of
the local spin-polarized currents, shown spanned and assisted by inner-edge
channels. From such a deeply fractalized SC building block, we introduce a rich
tapestry formed by superior SC hierarchies, enlightening intricate patterns and
unique fingerprints that offer valuable insights into how helical edge
transport occurs in these fractal dimensions.

<p>The role of spin fluctuations near magnetic phase transitions is crucial for
generating various exotic phenomena, including anomalies in the extraordinary
Hall effect, excess spin-current generation through the spin-Hall effect (SHE),
and enhanced spin-pumping, amongst others. In this study, we experimentally
investigate the temperature dependence of spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated
by Mn3Ni0.35Cu0.65N (MNCN), a member of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic
family that exhibits unconventional magnetotransport properties. Our work
uncovers a strong and nontrivial temperature dependence of SOTs, peaking near
the N\'eel temperature of MNCN, which cannot be explained by conventional
intrinsic and extrinsic scattering mechanisms of the SHE. Notably, we measure a
maximum SOT efficiency of 30%, which is substantially larger than that of
commonly studied nonmagnetic materials such as Pt. Theoretical calculations
confirm a negligible SHE and a strong orbital Hall effect that can explain the
observed SOTs. We propose a previously unidentified mechanism wherein
fluctuating antiferromagnetic moments trigger the generation of substantial
orbital currents near the N\'eel temperature due to the emergence of scalar
spin chirality. Our findings present an approach for enhancing SOTs, which
holds promise for magnetic memory applications by leveraging antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuations to amplify both orbital and spin currents.

<p>The scattering of phonons by geometrical defects at the nanoscale is still a
black box, it remains a significant challenge for understanding heat transfer
in nanoscale devices and systems. In this study, we aim to explore the
characteristics of phonon scattering by a single pore to gain insights into
thermal transport in nanostructures. The paper outlines a methodology for
assessing the spatial distribution of the magnitude of the radial component of
the velocity of scattered phonons by the surface of a spherical pore. We
demonstrated that the size parameter, commonly employed in electromagnetic wave
scattering theory, is vital in determining the scattering regime. Our findings
indicate that as the size parameter diminishes, the magnitude of the velocity
field experiences a more pronounced decay with distance from the pore.
Additionally, we found that crystallographic directions are pivotal in shaping
the scattering patterns. This observation holds significance in comprehending
the influence of phonon coherence on thermal transport in nanostructured
materials.

<i>Barbara Dietz, Tobias Klaus, Marco Masi, Maksym Miski-Oglu, Achim Richter, Tatjana Skipa, Marcus Wunderle</i>
<p>We report on high-precision measurements that were performed with
superconducting waveguide networks with the geometry of a tetrahedral and a
honeycomb graph. They consist of junctions of valency three that connect
straight rectangular waveguides of incommensurable lengths. The experiments
were performed in the frequency range of a single transversal mode, where the
associated Helmholtz equation is effectively one dimensional and waveguide
networks may serve as models of quantum graphs with the joints and waveguides
corresponding to the vertices and bonds. The tetrahedral network comprises T
junctions, while the honeycomb network exclusively consists of Y junctions,
that join waveguides with relative angles 90 degree and 120 degree,
respectively. We demonstrate that the vertex scattering matrix, which describes
the propagation of the modes through the junctions strongly depends on
frequency and is non-symmetric at a T junction and thus differs from that of a
quantum graph with Neumann boundary conditions at the vertices. On the
contrary, at a Y junction, similarity can be achieved in a certain frequeny
range. We investigate the spectral properties of closed waveguide networks and
fluctuation properties of the scattering matrix of open ones and find good
agreement with random matrix theory predictions for the honeycomb waveguide
graph.

<i>John J R Scott, Guangming Lu, Brian J. Rodriguez, Ian MacLaren, Ekhard K.H. Salje, Miryam Arredondo</i>
<p>The elastic interaction between kinks (and antikinks) within domain walls
plays a pivotal role in shaping the domain structure, and their dynamics. In
bulk materials, kinks interact as elastic monopoles, dependent on the distance
between walls, and typically characterised by a rigid and straight domain
configuration. In this work we investigate the evolution of the domain
structure as the sample size decreases, by means of in-situ heating techniques
on free-standing samples. A significant transformation is observed: domain
walls exhibit pronounced curvature, accompanied by an increase in both domain
wall and junction density. This transformation is attributed to the pronounced
influence of kinks, inducing sample warping, where 'dipole dipole' interactions
are dominant. Moreover, we experimentally identify a critical thickness range
that delineates a cross-over between the monopolar and dipolar regimens and
corroborated this by detailed atomic simulations. These findings are relevant
for in-situ TEM studies and for the development of novel devices based on
free-standing ferroic thin films and nanomaterials.

physics-inspired compact model is used to effectively capture the underlying
mechanisms governing resistive switching in NbO$_{\rm x}$ and BiFeO$_{3}$ based
on memristive devices. The model includes different capacitive components in
metal-insulator-metal structures to simulate capacitive effects. Drift and
diffusion of particles are modeled and correlated with particles' inertia
within the system. Using the model, we obtain the I-V characteristics of both
devices that show good agreement with experimental findings and the
corresponding C-V characteristics. This model also replicates observed non-zero
crossing hysteresis in perovskite-based devices. Additionally, the study
examines how the reactance of the device changes in response to variations in
the device area and length.

<p>Concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) have attracted attention for their
promising properties; however, current manufacturing methods face challenges in
complexity, high costs, and limited scalability, raising concerns about
industrial viability. The prevalent technique, arc melting, yields high-purity
samples with complex shapes. In this study, we explore nanoindentation tests at
room temperature where arc- melted samples exhibit larger grain sizes,
diminishing the effects of grain boundaries on the results. Motivated by these
findings, our investigation focuses on the atomistic-level exploration of
plasticity mechanisms, specifically dislocation nucleation and propagation
during nanoindentation tests. The intricate chemistry of NiFeCrCo CSA
influences pile-ups and slip traces, aiming to elucidate plastic deformation by
considering both pristine and pre-existing stacking fault tetrahedra. Our
analysis scrutinizes dynamic deformation processes, defect nucleation, and
evolution, complemented by stress-strain and dislocation densities-strain
curves illustrating the hardening mechanism of defective materials.
Additionally, we examine surface morphology and plastic deformation through
atomic shear strain and displacement mappings. This integrated approach
provides insights into the complex interplay between material structure and
mechanical behavior, paving the way for an enhanced understanding and potential
advancements in CSA applications.

<h3>Exploring epitaxial structures for electrically pumped perovskite  lasers: a study of CsPb(Br,I)$_3$ based on the \textit{ab initio}  Bethe-Salpeter equation</h3>

<p>Halide perovskites are widely used as components of electronic and
optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
optically pumped lasers, field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and
$\gamma$-detectors. Despite this wide range of applications, the construction
of an electrically pumped perovskite laser remains challenging. In this paper,
we numerically justify that mixing two perovskite compounds with different
halide elements can lead to optical properties suitable for electrical pumping.
As a reference, the chosen model material was CsPbBr$_3$, whose performance as
a part of lasers has been widely recognised, with some Br atoms substituted by
I at specific sites. In particular, a strong enhancement of the low-energy
absorption peaks has been obtained using the \textit{ab initio} Bethe-Salpeter
equation. Based on these results, we propose specific architectures of ordered
doping that could be realised by epitaxial growth. Efficient light emission
from the bottom of the conduction band is expected.

<p>An aqueous sodium chloride solution was injected at a controlled rate into a
granular bed in a quasi-two-dimensional cell. The granular bed was made of
dried, highly water-absorbent gel particles whose swelling rate was controlled
by the salinity of the injected fluid. At a high salinity level (low swelling
rate), high injection rate, and short timescale, the injected fluid percolated
between the gel particles in an isotropic manner. Meanwhile, at a low salinity
level (high swelling rate), low injection rate, and long timescale, the gel
particles clogged the flow path, resulting in anisotropic branch-like
structures of the injected fluid front. The transition of the injection pattern
could be understood based on the ratio of the characteristic timescales of
swelling and injection. Moreover, the clogged pattern showed an oscillatory
pressure drop whose amplitude was increased with higher salinity. Such an
oscillatory behavior observed in an injection process in a swelling gel
particle may be relevant in geological situation; i.e., such as fluid migration
underground.

<h3>Do ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals really have a huge dielectric  permittivity?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16084" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16084</a>
<br>
<i>Vojko Matko, Ewa Gorecka, Damian Pociecha, Joanna Matraszek, Nataša Vaupotič</i>
<p>There is much scientific debate as to whether the newly discovered
ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals actually have a huge relative dielectric
constant or whether it is just an artefact related to the interpretation of the
dielectric spectroscopy measurement results. We show that the interpretation of
the dielectric measurements of highly polar liquid crystalline material
requires a new model that takes into account both the frequency response of the
tested material and the capacitance of the thin surface layers. A proper
interpretation of the measurements confirms a huge relative permittivity of the
ferroelectric nematic phase, which can even be orders of magnitude larger than
the measured apparent values. Furthermore, the value is independent of the cell
thickness and the type of surface electrodes.

<h3>Role of Inorganic Cations in the Excitonic Properties of Lead Halide  Perovskites</h3>

<p>We theoretically investigate lead iodide perovskites of general formula
APbI$_3$ for a series of metallic cations (namely Cs$^+$, Rb$^+$, K$^+$, Na$^+$
and Li$^+$) by means of the density functional theory, GW method and
Bethe-Salpeter equation including spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate that the
low-energy edges (up to 1.3 eV) of the absorption spectra are dominated by
weakly bound excitons, with binding energies $E_b$ $\sim$ 30-80~meV, and the
corresponding intensities grow as metallic %A$^+$ cations become lighter. The
middle parts of the spectra (1.8-2.4 eV), on the other hand, contain optical
dipole transitions comprising more strongly bound excitons ($E_b$ $\sim$
150-200~meV) located at PbI$_3$. These parts of the spectra correspond to the
optical-gain wavelengths which are experimentally achieved in optically-pumped
perovskite lasers. Finally, the higher energy parts, from about 2.8~eV
(LiPbI$_3$) to 4.3 eV (CsPbI$_3$), contain optical transitions with very
strongly bound excitons ($E_b$ $\sim$ 220-290~meV) located at the halide atoms
and the empty states of the metallic cations.

<p>The local atomic structure and lattice dynamics of two isostructural layered
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), 1T-TiSe$_2$ and 1T-VSe$_2$, were
studied using temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ti, V,
and Se K-edges. Analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) spectra, employing reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations, enabled
tracking the temperature evolution of the local environment in the range of
10-300 K. The atomic coordinates derived from the final atomic configurations
were used to calculate the partial radial distribution functions (RDFs) and the
mean-square relative displacement (MSRD) factors for the first ten coordination
shells around the absorbing atoms. Characteristic Einstein frequencies and
effective force constants were determined for Ti-Se, Ti-Ti, V-Se, V-V, and
Se-Se atom pairs from the temperature dependencies of MSRDs. The obtained
results reveal differences in the temperature evolution of lattice dynamics and
the strengths of intralayer and interlayer interactions in TiSe$_2$ and
VSe$_2$.

<br>
<i>J. K. Dewhurst, D. Gill, S. Shallcross, S. Sharma</i>
<p>A long standing problem in time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)
has been the absence of a functional able to capture excitonic physics under
laser pump conditions. Here we introduce a Kohn-Sham-Proca scheme that we
demonstrate reproduces both linear response excitonic effects in the absorption
in excellent agreement with experiment for a wide range of materials, but also
captures excitonic physics in the highly non-linear regime of ultrafast laser
pumping, in particular laser fluence dependent "bleaching" (i.e. reduction) of
the excitonic weight and the appearance of excitonic side bands. The approach
is a procedural functional -- the Kohn-Sham and Proca equations are
simultaneously time propagated -- allowing the straight-forward inclusion of,
for example, lattice and spin degrees of freedom into excitonic physics.

<p>Noncollinear spin systems with magnetically induced ferroelectricity from
changes in spiral magnetic ordering have attracted significant interest in
recent research due to their remarkable magnetoelectric effects with promising
applications. Single phase multiferroics are of great interest for these new
multifunctional devices, being Y-type hexaferrites good candidates, and among
them the ZnY compounds due to their ordered magnetic behaviour over room
temperature. Polycrystalline Y type hexaferrites with composition
Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2Fe2O22 (BSZFO) were sintered in 1050 C-1250 C temperature range.
Transverse susceptibility measurements carried out on these BSZFO samples in
the temperature range 80-350 K with DC fields up to +-0.5 T reveal different
behaviour depending on the sintering temperature. Sample sintered at 1250 C is
qualitatively different, suggesting a mixed Y and Z phase like CoY
hexaferrites. Sintering at lower temperatures produce single phase Y-type, but
the transverse susceptibility behaviour of the sample sintered at 1150 C is
shifted at temperatures 15 K higher. Regarding the DC field sweeps the observed
behaviour is a peak that shifts to lower values with increasing temperature,
and the samples corresponding to single Y phase exhibit several maxima and
minima in the 250 K to 330 K range at low DC applied field as a result of the
magnetic field induced spin transitions in this compound

<p>Ferroelectric materials with switchable electric polarization hold great
promise for a plethora of emergent applications, such as post-Moore's law
nanoelectronics, beyond-Boltzmann transistors, non-volatile memories, and
above-bandgap photovoltaic devices. Recent advances have uncovered an exotic
sliding ferroelectric mechanism, which endows to design atomically thin
ferroelectrics from non-ferroelectric parent monolayers. Although notable
progress has been witnessed in understanding its fundamental properties,
functional devices based on sliding ferroelectrics, the key touchstone toward
applications, remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate the rewritable, non-volatile
memory devices at room-temperature utilizing a two-dimensional (2D) sliding
ferroelectric semiconductor of rhombohedral-stacked bilayer molybdenum
disulfide. The 2D sliding ferroelectric memories (SFeMs) show superior
performances with a large memory window of >8V, a high conductance ratio of
above 106, a long retention time of >10 years, and a programming endurance
greater than 104 cycles. Remarkably, flexible SFeMs are achieved with
state-of-the-art performances competitive to their rigid counterparts and
maintain their performances post bending over 103 cycles. Furthermore,
synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity and image recognition with a high
accuracy of 97.81% are demonstrated based on flexible SFeMs. Our work
demonstrates the sliding ferroelectric memories and synaptic plasticity on both
rigid and flexible substrates, highlighting the great potential of sliding
ferroelectrics for emerging technological applications in brain-inspired
in-memory computing, edge intelligence and energy-efficient wearable
electronics.

<i>Steffen Bötzel, Frank Lechermann, Jannik Gondolf, Ilya M. Eremin</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent reports of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we analyzed theoretically the magnetic
excitations in the normal and the superconducting state in this compound, which
can be measured by inelastic neutron scattering or RIXS. We show that the
bilayer structure of the spin response allows to elucidate the role of the
interlayer interaction and the nature of the Cooper-pairing in a very efficient
way. In particular, we demonstrate the key difference between the potential
$s_\pm$ and $d$-wave gaps, proposed recently, by comparing the corresponding
response in the even and odd channels of the spin susceptibility. We show that
the mostly interlayer driven bonding-antibonding $s_\pm$ Cooper-pairing
produces a single large spin resonance peak in the odd channel only near the
$X$ point whereas spin resonances in both the odd and the even channel are
predicted for the $d$-wave scenario.

<h3>Superexchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy in MnPSe$_3$  monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16154</a>
<br>
<i>Guangyu Wang, Ke Yang, Yaozhenghang Ma, Lu Liu, Di Lu, Yuxuan Zhou, Hua Wu</i>
<p>Two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials are of great current
interest for their promising applications in spintronics. In this work, using
density functional theory calculations in combination with the maximally
localized Wannier functions method and the magnetic anisotropy analyses, we
study the electronic and magnetic properties of MnPSe$_3$ monolayer. Our
results show that it is a charge transfer antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator. For
this Mn$^{2+}$ $3d^5$ system, although it seems straightforward to explain the
AF ground state using the direct exchange, we find that the near 90$^\circ$
Mn-Se-Mn charge transfer type superexchange plays a dominant role in
stabilizing the AF ground state. Moreover, our results indicate that although
the shape anisotropy favors an out-of-plane spin orientation, the spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) leads to the experimentally observed in-plane spin orientation.
We prove that the actual dominant contribution to the magnetic anisotropy comes
from the second-order perturbation of the SOC, by analyzing its distribution
over the reciprocal space. Using the AF exchange and anisotropy parameters
obtained from our calculations, our Monte Carlo simulations give the N\'eel
temperature $T_{\rm N}=47$ K for MnPSe$_3$ monolayer, which agrees with the
experimental 40 K. Furthermore, our calculations show that under a uniaxial
tensile (compressive) strain, N\'eel vector would be parallel (perpendicular)
to the strain direction, which well reproduces the recent experiments. We also
predict that $T_{\rm N}$ would be increased by a compressive strain.

<h3>Target search kinetics for random walkers with memory</h3>

<br>
<i>Olivier Bénichou, Thomas Guérin, Nicolas Levernier, Raphaël Voituriez</i>
<p>In this chapter, we consider the problem of a non-Markovian random walker
(displaying memory effects) searching for a target. We review an approach that
links the first passage statistics to the properties of trajectories followed
by the random walker in the future of the first passage time. This approach
holds in one and higher spatial dimensions, when the dynamics in the vicinity
of the target is Gaussian, and it is applied to three paradigmatic target
search problems: the search for a target in confinement, the search for a
rarely reached configuration (rare event kinetics), or the search for a target
in infinite space, for processes featuring stationary increments or transient
aging. The theory gives access to the mean first passage time (when it exists)
or to the behavior of the survival probability at long times, and agrees with
the available exact results obtained perturbatively for examples of weakly
non-Markovian processes. This general approach reveals that the
characterization of the non-equilibrium state of the system at the instant of
first passage is key to derive first-passage kinetics, and provides a new
methodology, via the analysis of trajectories after the first-passage, to make
it quantitative.

<h3>Direct evidence of interfacial coherent electron-phonon coupling in  single-unit-cell FeSe film on Nb-doped SrTiO3</h3>

<i>Mengdi Zhang, Xiaotong Jiao, Mingxia Shi, Wenfeng Dong, Cui Ding, Yubin Wang, Tingxiao Qin, Haiyun Liu, Lili Wang, Zhenyu Zhang, Qi-Kun Xue, Qihua Xiong</i>
<p>The interface-enhanced superconductivity in monolayer iron selenide (FeSe)
films on SrTiO3 has been actively pursued in the past decade. Although a
synergistic effect between interfacial charge transfer and interfacial
electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is proposed to be responsible for the mechanism,
the microscopic nature of the interfacial EPC in the enhancement of
superconductivity remains highly controversial. Herein we experimentally reveal
that a coherent optical phonon mode at 4.2 THz from the SrTiO3 substrate
couples to FeSe electrons and modulates the quasiparticle relaxations using
ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. This mode originates from the
antiferrodistortive (AFD) transition in SrTiO3 and is significantly stronger in
the presence of monolayer FeSe than that in purely FeTe-capped Nb-doped SrTiO3.
Pump fluence and temperature-dependent spectroscopy measurements suggest that
SrTiO3 substrate facilitates the stabilization of FeSe structure and possibly
prevents the occurrence of nematic phase transition, supporting that SrTiO3
substrate modifies the electronic structure of monolayer FeSe through a strong
interfacial EPC strength as large as 0.77. Our results provide unprecedented
direct evidence that the strong coupling of SrTiO3 coherent phonon to FeSe
electrons is indeed responsible for the high-temperature superconductivity in
monolayer FeSe and SrTiO3 heterostructure.

<p>Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has drawn great interest for tunable photonics
and optoelectronics advancement. Its solution processing, though scalable,
results in randomly networked ensembles of discrete nanosheets with compromised
properties for tunable device fabrication. Here, we show via density-functional
theory calculations that the electronic structure of the individual
solution-processed nanosheets can be modulated by external electric fields
collectively. Particularly, the nanosheets can form Stark ladders, leading to
variations in the underlying optical transition processes and thus, tunable
macroscopic optical properties of the ensembles. We experimentally confirm the
macroscopic electro-optical modulation employing solution-processed thin-films
of MoS2 and ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE), and prove that the localized
polarization fields of P(VDF-TrFE) can modulate the optical properties of MoS2,
specifically, the optical absorption and photoluminescence on a macroscopic
scale. Given the scalability of solution processing, our results underpin the
potential of electro-optical modulation of solution-processed MoS2 for scalable
tunable photonics and optoelectronics. As an illustrative example, we
successfully demonstrate solution-processed electro-absorption modulators.

<i>F. Font, A. Estop, M. Calvo-Schwarzwalder, A. Valverde, T.G. Myers</i>
<p>We propose a mathematical model for describing column adsorption processes
where large amounts of contaminant are removed from a carrier gas. The large
mass loss causes velocity and pressure to be variables which must then be
determined along with the contaminant and gas concentrations and adsorbed
quantity. The adsorption rate is described using a Langmuir sink, which is
physically more sensible than the linear sink used in a previous study. The
proposed model is solved numerically and using a traveling wave approach. The
analytical solutions are consistent with previous models with fixed gas
velocity and provide excellent agreement when validated against experimental
data.

<i>Christopher D. Woodgate, Julie B. Staunton</i>
<p>Refractory high-entropy alloys are under consideration for applications where
materials are subjected to high temperatures and levels of radiation, such as
in the fusion power sector. However, at present, their scope is limited because
they are highly brittle at room temperature. One suggested route to mitigate
this issue is by alloying with Ti. In this theoretical study, using a
computationally efficient linear-response theory based on density functional
theory calculations of the electronic structure of the disordered alloys, we
study the nature of atomic short-range order in these multi-component
materials, as well as assessing their overall phase stability. Our analysis
enables direct inference of phase transitions in addition to the extraction of
an atomistic, pairwise model of the internal energy of an alloy suitable for
study via, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations. Once Ti is added into either the
NbMoTaW or VNbMoTaW system, we find that there is competition between chemical
phase ordering and segregation. These results shed light on observed chemical
inhomogeneity in experimental samples, as well as providing fundamental insight
into the physics of these complex systems.

<br>
<i>Edward Danquah Donkor, Adu Offei-Danso, Alex Rodriguez, Francesco Sciortino, Ali Hassanali</i>
<p>The presence of a second critical point in supercooled water as a scenario to
explain its anomalies has been a topic of intense investigation for the last
few decades. The molecular origins underlying this phenomenon are typically
rationalized in terms of the competition between local high-density (HD) and
low-density (LD) structures. The physical realization of these local structures
often requires the design of chemically inspired order parameters that are
inevitably subject to human intervention. Herein, we use unsupervised learning
to discover structures in atomistic simulations of liquid water close to its
putative Liquid-Liquid Critical point (LLCP). Encoding the information of local
environments using machine-learning inspired descriptors, we confirm the
presence of large heterogeneity in local environments of the water molecules
masking a proper identification of LD and HD local configurations. Our agnostic
approach shows the need to use non-local atomic structural descriptors that
characterize important fluctuations on the nanometer length scale which
ultimately lead to the emergence of LD and HD domains rationalizing the
microscopic origins of long-range density fluctuations close to criticality.

<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in understanding

<i>Rodrigo Soto, Martin Pinto, Ricardo Brito</i>
<p>When two active Brownian particles collide, they slide along each other until
they can continue their free motion. For persistence lengths much larger than
the particle diameter, the directors do not change, but the collision can be
modeled as producing a net displacement on the particles compared to their free
motion in the absence of the encounter. With these elements, a
Boltzmann--Enskog-like kinetic theory is built. A linear stability analysis of
the homogeneous state predicts a density instability resulting from the
effective velocity reduction of tagged particles predicted by the theory.

<h3>Theory of universal diode effect in three-terminal Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16262</a>
<br>
<i>Jorge Huamani Correa, Michal P. Nowak</i>
<p>We theoretically study the superconducting diode effect in a three-terminal
Josephson junction. The diode effect in superconducting systems is typically
related to the presence of a difference in the critical currents for currents
flowing in the opposite direction. We show that in multi-terminal systems this
effect occurs naturally without the need of the presence of any spin
interactions and is a result of the presence of a relative shift between the
Andreev bound states carrying the supercurrent. On an example of a
three-terminal junction, we demonstrate that the non-reciprocal current in one
of the superconducting contacts can be induced by proper phase biasing of the
other contacts, provided that there are at least two Andreev bound states in
the system and the symmetry of the system is broken. This result is confirmed
in numerical models describing the junctions in both the short- and
long-regime. By optimizing the geometry of the junction, we show that the
efficiency of the realized superconducting diode exceeds $35 \%$. We relate our
predictions to recent experiments on multi-terminal junctions, in which
non-reciprocal supercurrents were observed.

<i>Vahideh Sardari, Fatemeh Safari, Maniya Maleki</i>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of surface growth resulting from
sedimentation of spherical granular particles in a fluid environment, using
experiments and simulations. In the experimental part, spherical polystyrene
particles are poured down from the top of a vertical Hele-Shaw cell and form a
1+1-dimensional growing surface. The surface roughness is obtained from the
images and the growth and roughness exponents are measured. In the numerical
simulation part, the surface growth process is simulated using the Molecular
Dynamics method, considering the interactions between the grains; and the
exponents are calculated. In this method, unlike conventional simulation
models, instead of a discrete deposition law, the dynamics of the individual
particles throughout the process are obtained considering different forces
acting on the particles. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the
experiment, and we see a very good agreement between them. We find different
values for the exponents using different methods, which indicates that the
system is multi-affine and does not obey scaling laws of affine models.

<i>Danylo Mosiiets, Yann Genuist, Joël Cibert, Edith Bellet-Amalric, Moïra Hocevar</i>
<p>We propose a dual-adatom diffusion-limited model for the growth of compound
semiconductor nanowires via the vapor-liquid-solid or the vapour-solid-solid
mechanisms. The growth is catalyzed either by a liquid or a solid nanoparticle.
We validate the model using experimental data from the growth of InAs nanowires
catalyzed by a gold nanoparticle in a molecular beam epitaxy reactor.
Initially, we determine the parameters (diffusion lengths, flux to the seed,
Kelvin effect) that describe the growth of nanowires under an excess of one of
the two beams (for instance, group III or group V atoms). The diffusion-limited
model calculates the growth rate resulting from the current of atoms reaching
the seed. Our dual-adatom diffusion-limited model calculates for a compound
semiconductor, the instantaneous growth rate resulting from the smallest
current of the two types of atoms at a given time. We apply the model to
analyze the length-radius dependence of our InAs nanowires for growth
conditions covering the transition from the As-limited to the In-limited
regime. Finally, the model also describes the complex dependence of the
transition between both regimes on the nanowire radius and length. This
approach is generic and can be applied to study the growth of any compound
semiconductor nanowires.

<i>Guangyu Hu, Marat I. Latypov</i>
<p>We present AnisoGNNs -- graph neural networks (GNNs) that generalize
predictions of anisotropic properties of polycrystals in arbitrary testing
directions without the need in excessive training data. To this end, we develop
GNNs with a physics-inspired combination of node attributes and aggregation
function. We demonstrate the excellent generalization capabilities of AnisoGNNs
in predicting anisotropic elastic and inelastic properties of two alloys.

<h3>Viscous Mechano-Electric Response of Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid</h3>

<br>
<i>Peter Medle Rupnik, Luka Cmok, Nerea Sebastian, Alenka Mertelj</i>
<p>Direct viscous mechano-electric response is demonstrated for a
room-temperature ferroelectric nematic liquid, which combines large spontaneous
electric polarization with 3D fluidity. The mechano-electric transduction is
observed in the frequency range 1-200 Hz via a simple demonstrator device. The
liquid is placed into a deformable container with electrodes and the electric
current induced by both periodic and irregular actuation of the container is
examined. The experiments reveal a rich interplay of several distinct viscous
mechano-electric phenomena, where both shape deformations and material flow
cause changes in the electric polarization structure of a ferroelectric nematic
liquid. The results show that the mechano-electric features of the material
promise a considerable applicative perspective spanning from sensitive tactile
sensors to energy harvesting devices.

<h3>Phase Coexistence and Transitions between Antiferromagnetic and  Ferromagnetic States in a Synthetic Antiferromagnet</h3>

<p>In synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) the combination of antiferromagnetic
order and synthesis using conventional sputtering techniques is combined to
produce systems that are advantageous for spintronics applications. Here we
present the preparation and study of SAF multilayers possessing both
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction of
the kind used as hosts of chiral spin textures. The multilayers have an
antiferromagnetically (AF) aligned ground state but can be forced into a full
ferromagnetic (FM) alignment by applying an out-of-plane field $\sim 100$~mT.
We study the spin textures in these multilayers in their ground state as well
as around the transition point between the AF and FM states, which begins for
applied fields $\sim 40$~mT, by imaging the spin textures using complementary
methods: photo-emission electron, magnetic force, and Lorentz transmission
electron microscopies. The transformation into a FM state by field proceeds by
a nucleation and growth process, where first skyrmionic nuclei form, which
broaden into regions containing a FM-aligned labyrinth pattern that eventually
fills the whole film. This process occurs without any significant change in the
net magnetic moment of the multilayer. The mix of AF- and FM-aligned regions on
the micron scale in the middle of this transition is reminiscent of a
first-order phase transition that exhibits phase coexistence. These results are
important for guiding the design of spintronic devices using chiral magnetic
textures made from SAFs.

<h3>A growth diagram for plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy of GaN  nanocolumns on Si(111)</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Fernández-Garrido, J. Grandal, E. Calleja, M. A. Sánchez-García, D. López-Romero</i>
<p>The morphology of GaN samples grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy
on Si(111) was systematically studied as a function of impinging Ga/N flux
ratio and growth temperature (750-850{\deg}C).Two different growth regimes were
identified: compact and nanocolumnar. A growth diagram was established as a
function of growth parameters, exhibiting the transition between growth
regimes, and showing under which growth conditions GaN cannot be grown due to
thermal decomposition and Ga desorption. Present results indicate that adatoms
diffusion length and the actual Ga/N ratio on the growing surface are key
factors to achieve nanocolumnar growth.

<h3>Competing magnetic states on the surface of multilayer ABC-stacked  graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Lauro B. Braz, Tanay Nag, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<p>We study interaction-mediated magnetism on the surface of ABC-multilayer
graphene driven by its zero-energy topological flat bands. Using the
random-phase approximation we treat onsite Hubbard repulsion and find multiple
competing magnetic states, due to both intra- and inter-valley scattering, with
the latter causing an enlarged magnetic unit cell. At half-filling and when the
Hubbard repulsion is weak, we observe two different ferromagnetic orders. Once
the Hubbard repulsion becomes more realistic, new ferrimagnetic orders arise
with distinct incommensurate intra- or inter-valley scattering vectors
depending on interaction strength and doping, leading to a multitude of
competing magnetic states.

<h3>Three-band extension for the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16346" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16346</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantin V. Grigorishin</i>
<p>By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with
inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band
Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly
asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band
model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of
particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered
H-boson from the single-band theory and decay into fermions of only the third
generation. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second
generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor
conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the
Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters
(i.e so called "dark matter"). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined
by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small
($\sim 10^{-20}\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband
coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current,
these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone
bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields causes the existence of
three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the
corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the
generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the
three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without
interaction with the Higgs condensates.

<h3>Theory of intrinsic acoustic plasmons in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16384</a>
<br>
<i>Lorenzo Cavicchi, Iacopo Torre, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Frank H. L. Koppens, Marco Polini</i>
<p>We present a theoretical study of the intrinsic plasmonic properties of
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as a function of the twist angle $\theta$ (and
other microscopic parameters such as temperature and filling factor). Our
calculations, which rely on the random phase approximation, take into account
four crucially important effects, which are treated on equal footing: i) the
layer-pseudospin degree of freedom, ii) spatial non-locality of the
density-density response function, iii) crystalline local field effects, and
iv) Hartree self-consistency. We show that the plasmonic spectrum of TBG
displays a smooth transition from a strongly-coupled regime (at twist angles
$\theta \lesssim 2^{\circ}$), where the low-energy spectrum is dominated by a
weakly dispersive intra-band plasmon, to a weakly-coupled regime (for twist
angles $\theta \gtrsim 2^{\circ}$) where an acoustic plasmon clearly emerges.
This crossover offers the possibility of realizing tunable mid-infrared
sub-wavelength cavities, whose vacuum fluctuations may be used to manipulate
the ground state of strongly correlated electron systems.

<i>Peter Sollich</i>
<p>In this contribution to the proceedings of the 29th Solvay Conference on
Physics I will give an overview of some key challenges in our theoretical
understanding of the rheology of glasses, focussing on (i) steady shear flow
curves and their relation to the glass and jamming transitions, (ii) ductile
versus brittle yielding in shear startup and (iii) yielding under oscillatory
shear. I will also briefly discuss connections to the reversible-irreversible
and random organization transitions as well as to the broad field of memory
formation in materials.
