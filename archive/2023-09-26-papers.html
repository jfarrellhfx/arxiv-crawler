<h3>Navier-Stokes equations for low-temperature one-dimensional fluids</h3>

We consider one dimensional interacting quantum fluids, such as the Lieb
Liniger gas. By computing the low temperature limit of its (generalised)
hydrodynamics we show how in this limit the gas is well described by a
conventional viscous (Navier Stokes) hydrodynamic for density, fluid velocity
and the local temperature, and the other generalised temperatures in the case
of integrable gases. The dynamic viscosity is proportional to temperature and
can be expressed in a universal form only in terms of the emergent Luttinger
Liquid parameter K and its compressibility. We show that the heating factor is
finite even in the zero temperature limit, which implies that viscous
contribution remains relevant also at zero temperatures. Moreover, we find that
in the semi classical limit of small couplings, kinematic viscosity diverges,
reconciling with previous observations of Kardar Parisi Zhang fluctuations in
mean field quantum fluids.

<h3>On a class of solvable stationary non equilibrium states for mass  exchange models</h3>

We consider a family of models having an arbitrary positive amount of mass on
each site and randomly exchanging an arbitrary amount of mass with nearest
neighbor sites. We restrict to the case of diffusive models. We identify a
class of reversible models for which the product invariant measure is known and
the gradient condition is satisfied so that we can explicitly compute the
transport coefficients associated to the diffusive hydrodynamic rescaling.
Based on the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory \cite{mft} we have that the large
deviations rate functional for a stationary non equilibrium state can be
computed solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation depending only on the transport
coefficients and the details of the boundary sources. Thus, we are able to
identify a class of models having transport coefficients for which the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation can indeed be solved. We give a complete
characterization in the case of generalized zero range models and discuss
several other cases. For the generalized zero range models we identify a class
of discrete models that, modulo trivial extensions, coincides with the class
discussed in \cite{FG} and a class of continuous dynamics that coincides with
the class in \cite{FFG}. Along the discussion we obtain a complete
characterization of reversible misanthrope processes solving the discrete
equations in \cite{CC}.

We have grown high-quality magnetite micrometric islands on ruthenium stripes
on sapphire through a combination of magnetron sputtering (Ru film),
high-temperature molecular beam epitaxy (oxide islands), and optical
lithography. The samples have been characterized by atomic force microscopy,
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism in a
photoemission microscope. The magnetic domains on the magnetite islands can be
modified by the application of current pulses through the Ru stripes in
combination with magnetic fields. The modification of the magnetic domains is
explained by the Oersted field generated by the electrical current flowing
through the stripes underneath the magnetite nanostructures. The fabrication
method is applicable to a wide variety of rock salt and spinel oxides.

<h3>Quantifying Li-content for compositional tailoring of lithium ferrite  ceramics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14377" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14377</a>

Owing to their multiple applications, lithium ferrites are relevant materials
for several emerging technologies. For instance, LiFeO2 has been spotted as an
alternative cathode material in Li-ion batteries, while LiFe5O8 is the lowest
damping ferrite, holding promise in the field of spintronics. The Li-content in
lithium ferrites has been shown to greatly affect the physical properties, and
in turn, the performance of functional devices based on these materials.
Despite this, lithium content is rarely accurately quantified, as a result of
the low number of electrons in Li hindering its identification by means of
routine materials characterization methods. In the present work, magnetic
lithium ferrite powders with Li:Fe ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5 have been
synthesized, successfully obtaining phase-pure materials (LiFeO2 and LiFe5O8),
as well as a controlled mixture of both phases. The powders have been compacted
and subsequently sintered by thermal treatment (Tmax = 1100 {\deg}C) to
fabricate dense pellets which preserve the original Li:Fe ratios. Li-content on
both powders and pellets has been determined by two independent methods: (i)
Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy combined with nuclear reaction analysis
and (ii) Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data. With good
agreement between both techniques, it has been confirmed that the Li:Fe ratios
employed in the synthesis are maintained in the sintered ceramics. The same
conclusion is drawn from spatially-resolved confocal Raman microscopy
experiments on regions of a few microns. Field emission scanning electron
microscopy has evidenced the substantial grain growth taking place during the
sintering process - mean particle sizes rise from about 600 nm in the powders
up to 3.8(6) um for dense LiFeO2 and 10(2) um for LiFe5O8 ceramics.

<h3>Signatures of Parafermion Zero Modes in Fractional Quantum  Hall-Superconductor Heterostructures</h3>

Parafermion zero modes can arise in hybrid structures composed of $\nu=1/m$
fractional quantum Hall edges proximitized with an s-wave superconductor. Here
we consider parafermion and Cooper pair tunneling, and backscattering in a
junction formed in such hybrid structures. We find that the $4\pi m$
periodicity due to parafermion-only tunneling reduces, in the presence of
backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at
finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear
signature of parafermion tunneling remains in the shape of the current-phase
relation.

<h3>Homotopy, Symmetry, and Non-Hermitian Band Topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14416" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14416</a>

<br>
Non-Hermitian matrices are ubiquitous in the description of nature ranging
from classical dissipative systems, including optical, electrical, and
mechanical metamaterials, to scattering of waves and open quantum many-body
systems. Seminal K-theory classifications of non-Hermitian systems based on
line and point gaps in the presence of symmetry have deepened the understanding
of a wide range of physical phenomena. However, ample systems remain beyond
this description; reference points and lines are in general unable to
distinguish whether multiple non-Hermitian bands exhibit band crossings and
braids. To remedy this we consider the complementary notions of non-Hermitian
band gaps and separation gaps that crucially include a broad class of
multi-band scenarios, enabling the description of generic band structures with
symmetries. With these concepts, we provide a unified and systematic
classification of both gapped and nodal non-Hermitian systems in the presence
of physically relevant parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) and pseudo-Hermitian
symmetries using homotopy theory. This uncovers new fragile phases and,
remarkably, also implies new stable phenomena stemming from the topology of
both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In particular, we reveal different Abelian
and non-Abelian phases in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, described by frame
and braid topology. The corresponding invariants are robust to
symmetry-preserving perturbations that do not close band gaps, and they also
predict the deformation rules of nodal phases. We further demonstrate that
spontaneous symmetry breaking in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems is captured
by a Chern-Euler description. These results open the door for theoretical and
experimental exploration of a rich variety of novel topological phenomena in a
wide range of physical platforms.

<h3>Tunable topological magnetism in superlattices of nonmagnetic B20  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14421" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14421</a>
<br>
<i>Vladislav Borisov, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict topological magnetic properties of B20 systems, that are organized
in atomically thin multilayers. In particular we focus on FeSi/CoSi and
FeSi/FeGe superlattices with different number of layers and interface
structure. We demonstrate that absence of long range magnetic order, previously
observed in bulk FeSi and CoSi, is broken near the FeSi/CoSi interface, where a
magnetic state with non-trivial topology appears. Using electronic structure
calculations in combination with the magnetic force theorem, we calculate the
Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions in these systems. With
this information, we perform atomistic spin dynamics simulations at finite
temperature and applied magnetic field for large supercells with up to
$2\cdot10^6$ spins to capture the complexity of non-collinear textures induced
by the DM interaction. The spin dynamics simulations predict the formation of
antiskyrmions in a [001]-oriented FeSi/CoSi multilayer, intermediate skyrmions
in a [111]-oriented FeSi/CoSi system and Bloch skyrmions in the FeSi/FeGe (001)
system. The size of different types of skyrmions is found to vary between 7 nm
and 37 nm. The varying topological magnetic texture in these systems can be
attributed to the complex asymmetric structure of the DM micromagnetic matrix,
which is different from previously known topological magnets. Furthermore,
through structural engineering, we demonstrate that both FM and AFM skyrmions
can be stabilized, where the latter are especially appealing for applications
due to the zero skyrmion Hall effect. The proposed B20 multilayers show
potential for further exploration and call for experimental confirmation.

<h3>Structure, spin correlations and magnetism of the $S = 1/2$  square-lattice antiferromagnet Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ ($0 \leq x \leq  1$)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum spin liquids are highly entangled magnetic states with exotic
properties. The $S = 1/2$ square-lattice Heisenberg model is one of the
foundational models in frustrated magnetism with a predicted, but never
observed, quantum spin liquid state. Isostructural double perovskites
Sr$_2$CuTeO$_6$ and Sr$_2$CuWO$_6$ are physical realizations of this model, but
have distinctly different types magnetic order and interactions due to a
$d^{10}/d^0$ effect. Long-range magnetic order is suppressed in the solid
solution Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ in a wide region of $x = 0.05-0.6$, where
the ground state has been proposed to be a disorder-induced spin liquid. Here
we show that the spin-liquid-like $x = 0.2$ and $x = 0.5$ samples have
distinctly different local spin correlations, which suggests they have
different ground states. Furthermore, the previously ignored interlayer
coupling between the square-planes is likely to play a role in the suppression
of magnetic order on the W-rich side at $x \approx 0.6$. These results
highlight the complex magnetism of Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ and hint at a
new quantum critical point at $x \approx 0.3$.

<h3>Instanton confinement-deconfinement transitions: The stability of  pseudogap phases and topological order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14424" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14424</a>
<br>
<i>Predrag Nikolić</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the stability of certain many-body quantum states which may exist
at zero or finite temperatures, may lack long-range order and even topological
order, and still are thermodynamically distinct from uncorrelated disordered
phases. We sharply characterize such states by the conservation of topological
charge, or equivalently confinement of instantons, using a generalization of
the Wilson loop and the correlation length of an emergent gauge field. Our main
conclusions are: (i) topological orders can exist at finite temperatures, (ii)
relativistic liquids of topological defects can also exist as stable phases at
finite temperatures, and (iii) there are two universality classes of instanton
suppression. We also relate the instanton dynamics to the problem of the
pseudogap state in underdoped cuprates. A universal experimental signature of
the instanton deconfinement transition is a change of the quantum noise
spectrum, which can perhaps be measured in some situations, for example via a
quantum anomaly, or indirectly detected with a specific heat jump. The method
of analysis is a functional renormalization group that generalizes the Coulomb
gas treatment of Kosterlitz and Thouless to arbitrary interactions and
dimensions. In particular, we construct an exact non-perturbative technique for
confining interactions between instantons, which introduce irreparable
infra-red divergences in the standard perturbative approaches.

We explore the possibilities for spin-singlet superconductivity in newly
discovered altermagnets. Investigating $d$-wave altermagnets, we show that
finite-momentum superconductivity can easily emerge in altermagnets even though
they have no net magnetization, when the superconducting order parameter also
has $d$-wave symmetry with nodes coinciding with the altermagnet nodes.
Additionally, we find a rich phase diagram when both altermagnetism and an
external magnetic field are considered, including superconductivity appearing
at high magnetic fields from a parent zero-field normal state.

<h3>Fractional Chern Insulators vs. Non-Magnetic States in Twisted Bilayer  MoTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14429</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Fractionally filled Chern bands with strong interactions may give rise to
fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states, the zero-field analogue of the
fractional quantum Hall effect. Recent experiments have demonstrated the
existence of FCIs in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ without external magnetic fields
-- most robust at $\nu=-2/3$ -- as well as Chern insulators (CIs) at $\nu=-1$.
Although the appearance of both of these states is theoretically natural in an
interacting topological system, experiments repeatedly observe nonmagnetic
states (lacking FCIs) at $\nu=-1/3$ and $-4/3$, a puzzling result which has not
been fully theoretically explained. In this work, we perform Hartree-Fock and
exact diagonalization calculations to test whether the standard MoTe$_2$
moir\'e model with the (greatly varying) parameter values available in the
literature can reproduce the non-magnetic states at $\nu=-1/3$ and $-4/3$ in
unison with the FCI at $\nu=-2/3$ and CI state at $\nu = -1$. We focus on the
experimentally relevant twist angles and, crucially, include remote bands. We
find that the parameters proposed in [Wang et al. (2023)] can nearly capture
the experimental phenomena at $\nu=-1/3,-2/3,-1,-4/3$ simultaneously, though
the predicted ground states at $\nu=-1/3$ are still mostly fully-spin-polarized
and a larger dielectric constant $\epsilon>10$ than is typical of hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) substrate $\epsilon\sim 6$ is required. Our results show
the importance of remote bands in identifying the competing magnetic orders and
lay the groundwork for further study of the realistic phase diagram.

<h3>Geometric frustration of hard-disk packings on cones</h3>

<br>
<br>
Conical surfaces pose an interesting challenge to crystal growth: a crystal
growing on a cone can wrap around and meet itself at different radii. We use a
disk-packing algorithm to investigate how this closure constraint can
geometrically frustrate the growth of single crystals on cones with small
opening angles. By varying the crystal seed orientation and cone angle, we find
that -- except at special commensurate cone angles -- crystals typically form a
seam that runs along the axial direction of the cone, while near the tip, a
disordered particle packing forms. We show that the onset of disorder results
from a finite-size effect that depends strongly on the circumference and not on
the seed orientation or cone angle. This finite-size effect occurs also on
cylinders, and we present evidence that on both cylinders and cones, the defect
density increases exponentially as circumference decreases. We introduce a
simple model for particle attachment at the seam that explains the dependence
on the circumference. Our findings suggest that the growth of single crystals
can become frustrated even very far from the tip when the cone has a small
opening angle. These results may provide insights into the observed geometry of
conical crystals in biological and materials applications.

<h3>Exact Solution to the Quantum and Classical Dimer Models on the Spectre  Aperiodic Monotiling</h3>

<br>
<br>
The decades-long search for a shape that tiles the plane only aperiodically
under translations and rotations recently ended with the discovery of the
`spectre' aperiodic monotile. In this setting we study the dimer model, in
which dimers are placed along tile edges such that each vertex meets precisely
one dimer. The complexity of the tiling combines with the dimer constraint to
allow an exact solution to the model. The partition function is
$\mathcal{Z}=2^{N_{\textrm{Mystic}}+1}$ where $N_{\textrm{Mystic}}$ is the
number of `Mystic' tiles. We exactly solve the quantum dimer (Rokhsar Kivelson)
model in the same setting by identifying an eigenbasis at all interaction
strengths $V/t$. We find that test monomers, once created, can be infinitely
separated at zero energy cost for all $V/t$, constituting a deconfined phase in
a 2+1D bipartite quantum dimer model.

<h3>Quantum-geometry-induced anomalous Hall effect in non-unitary  superconductors and application to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14448</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Long Zhang, Weipeng Chen, Hao-Tian Liu, Yu Li, Zhiqiang Wang, Wen Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
The polar Kerr effect and the closely related anomalous charge Hall effect
are among the most distinguishing signatures of the superconducting state in
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and several other materials. These effects are often thought to
be generated by chiral superconducting pairing, and different mechanisms have
been invoked for the explanation. However, the previously proposed intrinsic
mechanisms often involve interband Cooper pairing that is unrealistically
strong. In this study we show that, thanks to the quantum geometric properties
of the Bloch electrons, non-unitary superconducting states without interband
pairing can also support intrinsic anomalous charge Hall effect. The key here
is to have a normal-state spin Hall effect, for which a nonzero spin-orbit
coupling is essential. A finite charge Hall effect then naturally arises at the
onset of a non-unitary superconducting pairing with finite spin polarization.
It depends on both the superconducting-state spin polarization and the
normal-state electron Berry curvature, the latter of which being the imaginary
part of the quantum geometric tensor of the Bloch states. Applying our results
to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ we conclude that, if the Kerr effect in the weakly-paired
superconducting state is of intrinsic origin, its superconductivity needs to be
one of the non-unitary odd-parity states. Our theory may be generalized to
other superconductors that exhibit polar Kerr effect.

<h3>Learning dislocation dynamics mobility laws from large-scale MD  simulations</h3>

The computational method of discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD), used as a
coarse-grained model of true atomistic dynamics of lattice dislocations, has
become of powerful tool to study metal plasticity arising from the collective
behavior of dislocations. As a mesoscale approach, motion of dislocations in
the DDD model is prescribed via the mobility law; a function which specifies
how dislocation lines should respond to the driving force. However, the
development of traditional hand-crafted mobility laws can be a cumbersome task
and may involve detrimental simplifications. Here we introduce a
machine-learning (ML) framework to streamline the development of data-driven
mobility laws which are modeled as graph neural networks (GNN) trained on
large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of crystal plasticity. We
illustrate our approach on BCC tungsten and demonstrate that our GNN mobility
implemented in large-scale DDD simulations accurately reproduces the
challenging tension/compression asymmetry observed in ground-truth MD
simulations while correctly predicting the flow stress at lower straining rate
conditions unseen during training, thereby demonstrating the ability of our
method to learn relevant dislocation physics. Our DDD+ML approach opens new
promising avenues to improve fidelity of the DDD model and to incorporate more
complex dislocation motion behaviors in an automated way, providing a faithful
proxy for dislocation dynamics several orders of magnitude faster than
ground-truth MD simulations.

<h3>Metallic transport of hard core bosons</h3>

<br>
<br>
Conductivities and Hall coefficients of two dimensional hard core bosons are
calculated using the thermodynamic expansions of Kubo formulas. At temperatures
above the superfluid transition, the resistivity rises linearly and is weakly
dependent on boson filling. The zeroth order Hall coefficient diverges toward
zero and unit fillings, and reverses its sign at half filling. The correction
terms, which are calculated up to fourth (Krylov) orders, do not alter this
behavior. The high temperature thermal Hall coefficient is reversed relative to
the electric Hall coefficient. We discuss relevance of HCB transport to the
metallic state of short coherence length superconductors.

<h3>The influence of antiferromagnetic spin cantings on the magnetic helix  pitch in cubic helimagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14480</a>
<br>
<i>Viacheslav A. Chizhikov, Vladimir E. Dmitrienko</i>
<br>
<br>
In cubic helimagnets MnSi and Cu2OSeO3 with their nearly isotropic magnetic
properties, the magnetic structure undergoes helical deformation, which is
almost completely determined by the helicoid wavenumber k = D / J, where
magnetization field stiffness J is associated with isotropic spin exchange, and
D is a pseudoscalar value characterizing the antisymmetric
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. While the wavenumber can be measured
directly in a diffraction experiment, the values of J and D can be calculated
from the constants of pair spin interactions, which enter as parameters into
the Heisenberg energy. However, the available analytical expression for D,
which is of the first order in the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), has significant
problems with accuracy. Here we show that hardly observable distortions of the
magnetic structure, namely the antiferromagnetic spin cantings, can
significantly change the constant D in the next approximation in SOC, thus
affecting the wavenumber of magnetic helicoids. The obtained analytical
expressions agree with the results of numerical simulation of magnetic helices
in Cu2OSeO3 to within a few percent.

<h3>Stable CoO$_2$ Nanoscrolls With Outstanding Electrical Properties</h3>

Layered CoO$_2$ is of great interest for its promising properties but is
meta-stable in its bulk form. CoO$_2$ was synthesized in a long-term stable
nanotubular or scrolled form by converting the quasi-one-dimensional crystal
structure of bulk Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ via a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting
one-dimensional nanostructures with very thin walls are investigated in detail.
The CoO_$2$ is found to crystallize in monoclinic form, similar to the related
CaCoO$_2$-CoO$_2$ misfit structure. Individual nanoscrolls are characterized
electrically and show a p-type semiconducting nature with a high
current-carrying capacity of $7.6 \times 10^6$ A/cm$^2$ and an extremely high
breakdown voltage of 27 kV/cm. The results demonstrate the possibility to
stabilize meta-stable materials in low-dimensional forms and a promising
application of the nanoscrolls as interconnect in high-voltage electronic
circuitry.

The transport of biomolecules, drugs, or reactants in stimuli-responsive
polymer networks in aqueous media is fundamental for many material and
environmental science applications, including drug delivery, biosensing,
catalysis, nanofiltration, water purification, and desalination. The transport
is particularly complex in dense polymer media, such as collapsed hydrogels,
where the molecules strongly interact with the polymer network and diffuse via
the hopping mechanism. In this study, we employ the Dynamical Density
Functional Theory (DDFT) to investigate the non-equilibrium release kinetics of
non-ionic subnanometer-sized molecules from collapsed microgel particles. The
theory is consistent with previous molecular dynamics simulations of collapsed
poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymer matrices, accommodating
molecules of varying shapes and sizes. We found that, despite the intricate
physico-chemical properties involved in the released process, the kinetics is
predominantly dictated by two material parameters: the diffusion coefficient of
the molecules inside the microgel ($D^*$) and the interaction free energy of
the molecules with the microgel ($\Delta G$). Our results reveal two distinct
limiting regimes. For large, slowly diffusing molecules weakly attracted to the
polymer network, the release is primarily driven by diffusion, with a release
time scaling as $\tau_{1/2} \sim 1/D^*$. Conversely, for small molecules
strongly attracted to the polymer network, the release time is dominated by the
interaction, scaling as $\tau_{1/2} \sim \exp(-\Delta G/k_{\textrm{B}} T)$. Our
DDFT calculations are directly compared with an analytical equation for the
half-release time, demonstrating excellent quantitative agreement. This
equation represents a valuable tool for predicting release kinetics from
collapsed microgels of non-ionic molecules.

<h3>The deep-acceptor nature of the chalcogen vacancies in 2D  transition-metal dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chalcogen vacancies in the semiconducting monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have frequently been invoked to explain a wide range of
phenomena, including both unintentional p-type and n-type conductivity, as well
as sub-band gap defect levels measured via tunneling or optical spectroscopy.
These conflicting interpretations of the deep versus shallow nature of the
chalcogen vacancies are due in part to shortcomings in prior first-principles
calculations of defects in the semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) TMDs that
have been used to explain experimental observations. Here we report results of
hybrid density functional calculations for the chalcogen vacancy in a series of
monolayer TMDs, correctly referencing the thermodynamic charge transition
levels to the fundamental band gap (as opposed to the optical band gap). We
find that the chalcogen vacancies are deep acceptors and cannot lead to n-type
or p-type conductivity. Both the (0/$-1$) and ($-$1/$-$2) transition levels
occur in the gap, leading to paramagnetic charge states S=1/2 and S=1,
respectively, in a collinear-spin representation. We discuss trends in terms of
the band alignments between the TMDs, which can serve as a guide to future
experimental studies of vacancy behavior.

<h3>Yang-Lee Zeros of Certain Antiferromagnetic Models</h3>

We revisit the somewhat less studied problem of Yang-Lee zeros of the Ising
antiferromagnet. For this purpose, we study two models, the nearest-neighbor
model on a square lattice, and the more tractable mean-field model
corresponding to infinite-ranged coupling between all sites. In the
high-temperature limit, we show that the logarithm of the Yang-Lee zeros can be
written as a series in half odd integer powers of the inverse temperature, $k$,
with the leading term $\sim k^{1/2}$. This result is true in any dimension and
for arbitrary lattices. We also show that the coefficients of the expansion
satisfy simple identities (akin to sum rules) for the nearest-neighbor case.
These new identities are verified numerically by computing the exact partition
function for a 2D square lattice of size $16\times16$. For the mean-field
model, we write down the partition function (termed the mean-field polynomials)
for the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) cases, and derive from
them the mean-field equations. We analytically show that at high temperatures
the zeros of the AFM mean-field polynomial scale as $\sim k^{1/2}$ as well.
Using a simple numerical method, we find the roots lie on certain curves (the
root curves), in the thermodynamic limit for the mean-field polynomials for the
AFM case as well as for the FM one. Our results show a new root curve, that was
not found earlier. Our results also clearly illustrate the phase transition
expected for the FM and AFM cases, in the language of Yang-Lee zeros. Moreover,
for the AFM case, we observe that the root curves separate two distinct phases
of zero and non-zero complex staggered magnetization, and thus depict a complex
phase boundary.

<h3>Low-temperature giant coercivity in Co$_{6.2}$Ga$_{3.8-x}$Ge$_{x}$  ($x$=2.4 to 3.2)</h3>

<br>
<br>
The observation of giant coercivity exceeding 20 kOe at low temperatures in
several transition-metal-based compounds has attracted significant attention
from a fundamental perspective. This research is also relevant to developing
rare-earth-free permanent magnets, wherein cobalt is one of the primary
elements used. To facilitate easy fabrication, rare-earth-free and Co-based
inorganic bulk magnets that exhibit giant coercivity are highly demanded but
rarely reported. Herein, we report the observation of low-temperature giant
coercivity in polycrystalline metallic Co$_{6.2}$Ga$_{3.8-x}$Ge$_{x}$ ($x$=2.4
to 3.2) with the hexagonal Fe$_{13}$Ge$_{8}$-type structure composed of Kagome
and triangular lattices. As the Ge content $x$ decreases from 3.2, the magnetic
ground state changes from ferrimagnetism to ferromagnetism at $x$=2.6. In the
ferrimagnetic state, we observed a signature of spin frustration arising from
the Kagome and/or triangular lattices of Co atoms. The ferromagnetic ordering
temperatures for the $x$=2.6 and 2.4 samples are 46 K and 60 K, respectively.
The coercive fields rapidly increase upon cooling and reach values of 26 kOe
and 44 kOe in the $x$=2.6 and 2.4 samples, respectively, at 2 K.

<br>
<br>
The nonlinear response of the excess work, when made via series expansion in
the parameter perturbation of the average thermodynamic work, requires
adjustments to agree with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In this work, I
present a well-behaved nonlinear response of the irreversible work, based on
its well-known cumulant series expansion. From the generalization of the
fluctuation-dissipation relation derived from it, I define the terms of the
series expansion in the parameter perturbation of the irreversible work by the
terms of the cumulants. Since every cumulant depends on raw moments, I define
from them the generalized relaxation functions, whose arbitrary constants were
chosen guaranteeing the accomplishment of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. A
procedure to calculate the nonlinear response of the irreversible work is then
provided.

<h3>Absence of nematic instability in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ever since the discovery of the charge density wave (CDW) transition in the
kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, the nature of its symmetry breaking is under
intense debate. While evidence suggests that the rotational symmetry is already
broken at the CDW transition temperature ($T_{\rm CDW}$), an additional
electronic nematic instability well below $T_{\rm CDW}$ was reported based on
the diverging elastoresistivity coefficient in the anisotropic channel
($m_{E_{2g}}$). Verifying the existence of a nematic transition below $T_{\rm
CDW}$ is not only critical for establishing the correct description of the CDW
order parameter, but also important for understanding the low-temperature
superconductivity. Here, we report elastoresistivity measurements of
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ using three different techniques probing both isotropic and
anisotropic symmetry channels. Contrary to previous reports, we find the
anisotropic elastoresistivity coefficient $m_{E_{2g}}$ is
temperature-independent except for a step jump at $T_{\rm CDW}$. The absence of
nematic fluctuations is further substantiated by measurements of the
elastocaloric effect, which show no enhancement associated with nematic
susceptibility. On the other hand, the symmetric elastoresistivity coefficient
$m_{A_{1g}}$ increases below $T_{\rm CDW}$, reaching a peak value of 90 at $T^*
= 20$ K. Our results strongly indicate that the phase transition at $T^*$ is
not nematic in nature and the previously reported diverging elastoresistivity
is due to the contamination from the $A_{1g}$ channel.

<h3>Quantum Equipartition Theorem for Arbitrary Quadratic System</h3>

Equipartition theorem is a fundamental law of classical statistical physics
which states that every degree of freedom will contribute $k_{B}T/2$ to the
energy, where $T$ is the temperature and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.
However a general quantum analogue of equipartition theorem has never been put
forward as yet. In the present paper, we focus on how to obtain generalized
equipartition theorem for an arbitrary quadratic system where the multimode
Brownian ocillators interacts with multiple reservoirs at the same temperature.
Another alternative method to derive the energy of the system is also
discussed. Our results can be viewed as an indispensable generalization of
rencent works about quantum equipartition theorem.

Ferroelectricity can exist in elemental phases as a result of charge
transfers between atoms occupying inequivalent Wyckoff positions. We
investigate the emergence of ferroelectricity in two-dimensional elemental
materials with buckled honeycomb lattices. Various multi-bilayer structures
hosting ferroelectricity are designed by stacking-engineering. Ferroelectric
materials candidates formed by group IV and V elements are predicted
theoretically. Ultrathin Bi films show layer-stacking-dependent physical
properties of ferroelectricity, topology, and metallicity. The two-bilayer Bi
film with a polar stacking sequence is found to be an elemental topological
ferroelectric material. Three and four bilayers Bi films with polar structures
are ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals with topological nontrivial edge
states. For Ge and Sn, trivial elemental polar metals are predicted. Our work
reveals the possibility of design two-dimensional elemental topological
ferroelectrics and polar metals by stacking-engineering.

This study presents the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 zigzag-square
lattice in a verdazyl-based complex, namely
($m$-Py-V-2,6-F$_2$)$[$Cu(hfac)$_2]$. Molecular orbital calculations suggest
the presence of five types of frustrated exchange couplings. Our observations
reveal an incremental increase in the magnetization curve beyond a critical
field, signifying a phase transition from the antiferromagnetic ordered state
to a quantum state characterized by a 1/2 plateau. This intriguing behavior
arises from the effective stabilization of a zigzag chain by the external
fields. These results provide evidence for field-induced dimensional reduction
in a zigzag-square lattice attributed to the effects of frustration.

<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of transient negative capacitance has sparked an intense
debate on the role of homogeneous and inhomogeneous mechanisms in polarizations
switching. In this work, we report observation of transient negative
capacitance in improper ferroelectric h-YbFeO3 films in a resistor-capacitor
circuit, and a concaved shape of anomaly in the voltage wave form, in the early
and late stage of the polarizations switching respectively. Using a
phenomenological model, we show that the early-stage negative capacitance is
likely due to the inhomogeneous switching involving nucleation and domain wall
motion, while the anomaly at the late stage, which appears to be a reminiscent
negative capacitance is the manifestation of the thermodynamically unstable
part of the free-energy landscape in the homogeneous switching. The complex
free-energy landscape in hexagonal ferrites may be the key to cause the abrupt
change in polarization switching speed and the corresponding anomaly. These
results reconcile the two seemingly conflicting mechanisms in the polarization
switching and highlight their different roles at different stages. The unique
energy-landscape in hexagonal ferrites that reveals the dual switching
mechanism suggests the promising application potential in terms of negative
capacitance.

First-principles calculations are a cornerstone of modern surface science and
heterogeneous catalysis. However, accurate reaction energies and barrier
heights are frequently inaccessible due to the approximations demanded by the
large number of atoms. Here we show that these approximations can be
systematically eliminated to solve the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation for
molecules on surfaces with chemical accuracy, commonly defined as 1 kcal/mol.
As a demonstration, we study water on the surface of
$\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ and $\mathrm{TiO}_2$, two prototypical and
industrially important metal oxides for which we obtain converged energies at
the level of coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative
triple excitations [CCSD(T)], commonly known as the "gold-standard" in
molecular quantum chemistry. We definitively resolve the energetics associated
with water adsorption and dissociation, enabling us to address recent
experiments and to analyze the errors of more commonly used approximate
theories.

We study the effect of nanowire shape on mechanical properties and
deformation behaviour of Cu nanowires using atomistic simulations. Simulations
were carried out on $[100]$ nanowires with different shapes such as triangular,
square, pentagon, hexagon and circular.Results indicate yield strength is
different for different shapes. In both cases, triangular nanowire exhibit the
lowest yield strength, while circular nanowire is the strongest. Deformation in
all the nanowires is dominated by partials slip and twinning. Due to twinning,
different shapes expose different surfaces at the twinned region. All nanowires
show ductile failure and square nanowire exhibits the highest failure strain,
while it is lowest for triangular nanowire.

<br>
<br>
Accurate determination of the adsorption energy of CO on the MgO (001)
surface has been a challenge for both computations and experiments over the
past three decades. A recent computational study by Shi and co-workers
(10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-h4czl) reported good agreement within $11$ meV ($1$
kJ/mol) between two popular theoretical methods: coupled-cluster with singles,
doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] and diffusion Monte Carlo. In this
short note, we report results on the same problem from periodic Gaussian-based
MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T), with the latter two performed using a recently
developed extension of the local natural orbital (LNO) approximation to
problems with periodic boundary conditions. Our final periodic LNO-CCSD(T)
adsorption energy ($-198 \pm 11$ meV) is in quantitative agreement with the
embedded cluster-based LNO-CCSD(T) result ($-199 \pm 11$ meV) by Shi and
co-workers. The computational cost of our periodic LNO-CCSD(T) calculations is
comparable to that of the embedded cluster-based LNO-CCSD(T) and is 10 times
less expensive than the plane-wave-based periodic canonical CCSD(T) or 50 times
less expensive than the DMC calculations reported by Shi and co-workers. Our
findings highlight the accuracy and computational efficiency of the periodic
LNO-based approach for the simulation of surface chemistry with correlated
wavefunction methods.

This article delves into the micro-macro modeling of polymeric fluids,
considering various microscopic potential energies, including the classical
Hookean potential, as well as newly proposed modified Morse and Elastic-plastic
potentials. These proposed potentials encompass microscopic-scale bond-breaking
processes. The development of a thermodynamically consistent micro-macro model
is revisited, employing the energy variational method. To validate the model's
predictions, we conduct numerical simulations utilizing a deterministic
particle-FEM method. Our numerical findings shed light on the distinct
behaviors exhibited by polymer chains at the micro-scale in comparison to the
macro-scale velocity and induced shear stresses of fluids under shear flow.
Notably, we observe that polymer elongation, rotation, and bond breaking
contribute to the zero polymer-induced stress in the micro-macro model when
employing Morse and Elastic-plastic potentials. Furthermore, at high shear
rates, polymer rotation is found to induce shear-thinning behavior in the model
employing the classical Hookean potential.

<h3>Peak Effects Induced by Particle Irradiations in 2H-NbSe2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Various peak effects in 2H-NbSe2 single crystals induced by particle
irradiations were studied. 3 MeV proton irradiation magnified the peak effect
induced by order-disorder transition of vortices, where the peak field shifts
from high fields to low fields with increasing irradiation dose. For the peak
effect in NbSe2 with splayed columnar defects (CDs), as the splayed angle
increases, peak field gradually shifts from high fields to low fields.
Numerical calculations have been conducted to investigate the mechanism of the
peak effect. The calculated results exhibit excellent agreement with
experimental observations. Analyses of field dependence of Jc reveal the
formation of non-uniform Jc flow with increasing splayed angle, which plays a
crucial role in inducing the self-field peak effect in superconductors with
splayed CDs. In samples with symmetric splayed CDs with respect to the c-axis
generated by 800 MeV Xe and 320 MeV Au ions, coexistence of order-disorder
transition-induced peak effect and self-field peak effect was observed. In the
case of 320 MeV Au irradiated samples, when the splay angle is small, the two
peak effects transform into a broad peak, which has similarity to the anomalous
peak effect observed in iron-based superconductors. Interestingly, the broad
anomalous peak effect is strongly suppressed when the external magnetic field
is applied parallel to one of splayed CDs.

<br>
<br>
Alkali metal $\beta$/$\beta^{\prime\prime}$ aluminas are among the fastest
ionic conductors, yet little is understood about the role of defects in the ion
transport mechanism. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to
investigate the crystal structures of $\beta$ and $\beta^{\prime\prime}$
phases, and vacancy and interstitial defects in these materials. We find that
charge transport is likely to be dominated by alkali metal interstitials in
$\beta$-aluminas and by vacancies in $\beta^{\prime\prime}$ aluminas. Lower
bounds for the activation energy for diffusion are found by determining the
minimum energy paths for defect migration. The resulting migration barriers are
lower than the experimental activation energies for conduction in Na $\beta$
and $\beta^{\prime\prime}$ aluminas, suggesting a latent potential for
optimization. The lowest activation energy of about 20 meV is predicted for
correlated vacancy migration in K $\beta^{\prime\prime}$ alumina.

<br>
<br>
The electron/hole spin-photon interaction is studied in an asymmetrical
InSb/Ge nanowire quantum dot. The spin-orbit coupling in the quantum dot
mediates not only a transverse spin-photon interaction, but also a longitudinal
spin-photon interaction due to the asymmetry of the confining potential. Both
the transverse and the longitudinal spin-photon interactions have non-monotonic
dependence on the spin-orbit coupling. For realistic spin-orbit coupling in the
quantum dot, the longitudinal spin-photon interaction is much (at least one
order) smaller than the transverse spin-photon interaction. The order of the
transverse spin-photon interaction is about 1 nm in terms of length $|z_{eg}|$,
or 0.1 MHz in terms of frequency $eE_{0}|z_{eg}|/h$ for a moderate cavity
electric field amplitude $E_{0}=0.4$ V/m.

<h3>Dynamic fluctuations of current and mass in nonequilibrium mass  transport processes</h3>

<br>
<i>Animesh Hazra, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan</i>
<br>
<br>
We study steady-state dynamic fluctuations of current and mass, as well as
the corresponding power spectra, in conserved-mass transport processes on a
ring of $L$ sites; these processes violate detailed balance, have nontrivial
spatial structures, and their steady states are not described by the
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. We exactly calculate, for all times $T$, the
fluctuations $\langle \mathcal{Q}_i^2(T) \rangle$ and $\langle
\mathcal{Q}_{sub}^2(l, T) \rangle$ of the cumulative currents upto time $T$
across $i$th bond and across a subsystem of size $l$ (summed over bonds in the
subsystem), respectively; we also calculate the (two-point) dynamic correlation
function for subsystem mass. In particular, we show that, for large $L \gg 1$,
the bond-current fluctuation grows linearly for $T \sim {\cal O}(1)$,
subdiffusively for $T \ll L^2$ and then again linearly for $T \gg L^2$. The
scaled subsystem current fluctuation $\lim_{l \rightarrow \infty, T \rightarrow
\infty} \langle \mathcal{Q}^2_{sub}(l, T) \rangle/2lT$ converges to the
density-dependent particle mobility $\chi$ when the large subsystem size limit
is taken first, followed by the large time limit. Remarkably, the scaled
current fluctuation $D \langle \mathcal{Q}_i^2(T)\rangle/2 \chi L \equiv {\cal
W}(y)$ as a function of scaled time $y=DT/L^2$ is expressed in terms of a
universal scaling function ${\cal W}(y)$, where $D$ is the bulk-diffusion
coefficient. Similarly, the power spectra for current and mass time series are
characterized by the respective universal scaling functions, which are
calculated exactly. We provide a microscopic derivation of equilibrium-like
Green-Kubo and Einstein relations, that connect the steady-state current
fluctuations to the response to an external force and to mass fluctuation,
respectively.

We propose a method to change the effective interaction between two fluids by
modulation of their local density distributions with external periodic
potentials, whereby the mixing properties can be controlled. This method is
applied to a mixture of dilute bosonic gases, and binodal and spinodal curves
emerge in the phase diagram. Spinodal decomposition into a mixed-bubble state
becomes possible, in which one of the coexisting phases has a finite mixing
ratio. A metastable mixture is also realized, which undergoes phase separation
via nucleation.

Designing new compounds with the coexistence of diverse physical properties
is of great significance for broad applications in multifunctional electronic
devices. In this work, based on density functional theory, we predict the
coexistence of mechanical superhardness and the controllable magnetism in the
clathrate material \b{eta}-C3N2 through the implant of the external atom into
the intrinsic cage structure. Taking hydrogen-doping (H@\b{eta}-C3N2) and
fluorine-doping (F@\b{eta}-C3N2) as examples, our calculations indicate these
two doped configurations are stable and discovered that they belong to
antiferromagnetic semiconductor and ferromagnetic semi-metal, respectively.
These intriguing magnetic phase transitions originate from their distinctive
band structure around the Fermi level and can be well understood by the 3D
Hubbard model with half-filling occupation and the Stoner model. Moreover, the
high Vickers hardness of 49.0 GPa for H@\b{eta}-C3N2 and 48.2 GPa for
F@\b{eta}-C3N2 are obtained, suggesting they are clathrate superhard materials
as its host. Therefore, the incorporation of H and F in \b{eta}-C3N2 gives rise
to a new type of superhard antiferromagnetic semiconductor and superhard
ferromagnetic semimetal, respectively, which could have potential applications
in harsh conditions. Our work provides an effective strategy to design a new
class of highly desirable multifunctional materials with excellent mechanical
properties and magnetic properties, which may arouse spintronic applications in
superhard materials in the future.

<br>
<br>
The microscopic pairing mechanism for superconductivity in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene remains an open question. Recent experimental studies
seem to rule out a purely electronic mechanism due to the insensitivity of the
critical superconducting temperature to either a highly doped screening layer
or the proximity to a metallic screening gate. In this theoretical work, we
explore the role of external screening layers on the superconducting properties
of twisted bilayer graphene within a purely electronic mechanism. Consistent
with the experimental observations, we find that the critical temperature is
unaffected by screening unless the screening layer is closer than 3 nanometers
from the superconductor. Thus, the available transport data is not in
contradiction with a plasmon-mediated mechanism. We also investigate other
properties of this plasmon-mediated superconductivity including signatures in
the tunneling density of states as probed in spectroscopy experiments.

We apply the thermal (imaginary time) perturbative expansion to the relevant
effective field theory to compute characteristics of the phase transition to
the ordered state which can occur at low temperatures in the gas of
(nonrelativistic) spin 1/2 fermions interacting through a short-range spin
independent repulsive binary interaction potential. We show how to obtain a
systematic expansion of the system's free energy depending on the densities
$n_+$ and $n_-$ of spin-up and spin-down fermions. In this paper we truncate
this expansion at the second order and determine, by numerically minimizing the
free energy, the equilibrium proportions of $n_+$ and $n_-$ (that is, the
system's polarization) as functions of the temperature, the system's overall
density $n = n_+ + n_-$ and the strength of the interaction.

Crystalline phase structure is essential for understanding the performance
and properties of a material. Therefore, this study identified and quantified
the crystalline phase structure of a sample based on the diffraction pattern
observed when the crystalline sample was irradiated with electromagnetic waves
such as X-rays. Conventional analysis necessitates experienced and
knowledgeable researchers to shorten the list from many candidate crystalline
phase structures. However, the Conventional diffraction pattern analysis is
highly analyst-dependent and not objective. Additionally, there is no
established method for discussing the confidence intervals of the analysis
results. Thus, this study aimed to establish a method for automatically
inferring crystalline phase structures from diffraction patterns using Bayesian
inference. Our method successfully identified true crystalline phase structures
with a high probability from 50 candidate crystalline phase structures.
Further, the mixing ratios of selected crystalline phase structures were
estimated with a high degree of accuracy. This study provided reasonable
results for well-crystallized samples that clearly identified the crystalline
phase structures.

<br>
We use the thickness of Cu layers to control all-optical switching of
magnetization in adjacent Gd$_{24}$(Fe$_9$0Co$_{10}$)$_{76}$ films. While
increasing the Cu thickness from 5 to 900nm has no effect on the switching
threshold, it significantly enlarges the fluence and pulse duration at which
multiple domains emerge. Having shown that thermally activated multi-domain
formation limits the maximum fluence and pulse duration for controlled
switching, we demonstrate that continuous magnetization reversal precedes
multi-domain formation in Gd$_{18}$Dy$_4$Co$_{78}$ films excited with fluences
slightly larger than the multi-domain threshold.

<br>
<br>
Phonons are quantized vibrations of a crystal lattice that play a crucial
role in understanding many properties of solids. Density functional theory
(DFT) provides a state-of-the-art computational approach to lattice vibrations
from first-principles. We present a successful software implementation for
calculating phonons in the harmonic approximation, employing density-functional
perturbation theory (DFPT) within the framework of the full-potential
linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method as implemented in the electronic
structure package FLEUR. The implementation, which involves the Sternheimer
equation for the linear response of the wave function, charge density, and
potential with respect to infinitesimal atomic displacements, as well as the
setup of the dynamical matrix, is presented and the specifics due to the
muffin-tin sphere centered LAPW basis-set and the all-electron nature are
discussed. As a test, we calculate the phonon dispersion of several solids
including an insulator, a semiconductor as well as several metals. The latter
are comprised of magnetic, simple, and transition metals. The results are
validated on the basis of phonon dispersions calculated using the finite
displacement approach in conjunction with the FLEUR code and the phonopy
package, as well as by some experimental results. An excellent agreement is
obtained.

<h3>Identifying and abating copper foil impurities to optimize graphene  growth</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14811</a>
<br>
<i>N. Reckinger, B. Hackens</i>
<br>
<br>
Copper foil impurities are hampering scalable production of high-quality
graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Here, we conduct a thorough study
on the origin of these unavoidable contaminations at the surface of copper
after the CVD process. We identify two distinct origins for the impurities. The
first type is intrinsic impurities, originating from the manufacturing process
of the copper foils, already present at the surface before any high-temperature
treatment, or buried into the bulk of copper foils. The buried impurities
diffuse towards the copper surface during high-temperature treatment and
precipitate. The second source is external: silica contamination arising from
the quartz tube that also precipitate on copper. The problem of the extrinsic
silica contamination is readily solved upon using an adequate confinement the
copper foil samples. The intrinsic impurities are much more difficult to remove
since they appear spread in the whole foil. Nevertheless, electropolishing
proves particularly efficient in drastically reducing the issue.

<h3>Frustrated Altermagnetism and Charge Density Wave in Kagome  Superconductor CsCr3Sb5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14812" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14812</a>
<br>
<i>Chenchao Xu, Siqi Wu, Guo-Xiang Zhi, Guanghan Cao, Jianhui Dai, Chao Cao, Xiaoqun Wang, Hai-Qing Lin</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first-principles density-functional calculations, we investigate the
electronic structure and magnetism of the kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$.
At the ambient pressure, its ground state is found to be $4\times2$
altermagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) pattern, with an averaged effective
moment of $\sim$1.7$\mu_B$ per chromium atom. The magnetic long range order is
coupled to the lattice structure, generating 4$a_0$ structural modulation.
However, multiple competing SDW phases are present and energetically very
close, suggesting strong magnetic fluctuation and frustration. The electronic
states near the Fermi level are dominated by Cr-3d orbitals, and flat band or
van Hove singularities are away from the Fermi level. When external pressure is
applied, the energy differences between competing orders and the structural
modulations are suppressed by external pressure. The magnetic fluctuation
remains present and important at high pressure because the non-magnetic phase
is unstable up to 30 GPa. In addition, a bonding state between Cr-3d$_{xz}$ and
Sb$^{\mathrm{II}}$-p$_z$ quickly acquires dispersion and eventually becomes
metallic around 5 GPa, leading to a Lifshitz transition. Our findings strongly
support unconventional superconductivity in the CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ compound above 5
GPa, and suggest crucial role of magnetic fluctuations in the pairing
mechanism.

<h3>Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics in Ferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14817</a>
<br>
<i>Dongwook Go, Kazuya Ando, Armando Pezo, Stefan Blügel, Aurélien Manchon, Yuriy Mokrousov</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that dynamics of the magnetization in ferromagnets can pump the
orbital angular momentum, which we denote by orbital pumping. This is the
reciprocal phenomenon to the orbital torque that induces magnetization dynamics
by the orbital angular momentum in non-equilibrium. The orbital pumping is
analogous to the spin pumping established in spintronics but requires the
spin-orbit coupling for the orbital angular momentum to interact with the
magnetization. We develop a formalism that describes the generation of the
orbital angular momentum by magnetization dynamics within the adiabatic
perturbation theory. Based on this, we perform first-principles calculation of
the orbital pumping in prototypical $3d$ ferromagnets, Fe, Co, and Ni. The
results show that the ratio between the orbital pumping and the spin pumping
ranges from 5 to 15 percents, being smallest in Fe and largest in Ni. This
implies that ferromagnetic Ni is a good candidate for measuring the orbital
pumping. Implications of our results on experiments are also discussed.

<br>
<br>
In this letter we discuss how to add forces to the Langevin equation. We
derive the exact generalized Langevin equation for the dynamics of one particle
subject to an external force embedded in a system of many interacting
particles. The external force may depend on time and/or on the phase-space
coordinates of the system. We construct a projection operator such that the
drift coefficient, the memory kernel, and the fluctuating force of the
generalized Langevin equation are the same as for the system without external
driving. We show that the external force then enters the generalized Langevin
equation additively. In addition we obtain one term which, to our knowledge,
has up to now been overlooked. We analyze this additional term for an exemplary
system.

<h3>Faraday waves on a bubble Bose-Einstein condensed binary mixture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14878</a>
<br>
<i>Leonardo Brito, Lauro Tomio, Arnaldo Gammal</i>
<br>
<br>
By studying the dynamic stability of Bose-Einstein condensed binary mixtures
trapped on the surface of an ideal two-dimensional spherical bubble, we show
how the Rabi coupling between the species can modulate the interactions leading
to parametric resonances. In this spherical geometry, the discrete unstable
angular modes drive both phase separations and spatial patterns, with Faraday
waves emerging and coexisting with an immiscible phase. Noticeable is the fact
that, in the context of discrete kinetic energy spectrum, the only parameters
to drive the emergence of Faraday waves are the $s-wave$ contact interactions
and the Rabi coupling. Once analytical solutions for population dynamics are
obtained, the stability of homogeneous miscible species is investigated through
Bogoliubov-de Gennes and Floquet methods, with predictions being analysed by
full numerical solutions applied to the corresponding time-dependent coupled
formalism.

<br>
<i>Michael Zimmermann, Martin Oettel</i>
<br>
<br>
Using classical density functional theory, we study the behavior of dimers,
i.e. hard rods of length $L=2$, on a two-dimensional cubic lattice. For
deriving a free energy functional, we employ Levy's prescription which is based
on the minimization of a microscopic free energy with respect to the many-body
probability under the constraint of a fixed density profile. Using that, we
recover the functional originally found by Lafuente and Cuesta and derive an
extension. With this extension, the free energy functional is exact on cavities
that can hold at most two particles simultaneously. The new functional improves
the prediction of the free energy in bulk as well as in highly confined
systems, especially for high packing fractions, in comparison to that of
Lafuente and Cuesta.

<h3>Electronic and optical properties of core-shell InAlN nanorods: a  comparative study via LDA, LDA-1/2, mBJ and $G_0W_0$ methods</h3>

<br>
<br>
Currently, self-induced InAlN core-shell nanorods enjoy an advanced stage of
accumulation of experimental data from their growth and characterization as
well as a comprehensive understanding of their formation mechanism by the ab
initio modeling based on Synthetic Growth Concept. However, their electronic
and optical properties, on which most of their foreseen applications are
expected to depend, have not been investigated comprehensively. $G_0W_0$ is
currently regarded as a gold-standard methodology with quasi-particle
corrections to calculate electronic properties of materials in general. It is
also the starting point for higher-order methods that study excitonic effects,
such as those based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation. One major drawback of
$G_0W_0$, however, is its computational cost, much higher than
density-functional theory (DFT). Therefore, in many applications, it is highly
desirable to answer the question of how well approaches based on DFT, such as
e. g. LDA, LDA-1/2, and mBJ, can approximately reproduce $G_0W_0$ results with
respect to the electronic and optical properties. Thus, the purpose of the
present paper is to investigate how the DFT-based methodologies LDA, LDA-1/2,
and mBJ can be used as tools to approximate $G_0W_0$ in studies of the
electronic and optical properties of scaled down models of core-shell InAlN
nanorods. For these systems, we observed that band gaps, density of states,
dielectric functions, refractive indexes, absorption and reflectance
coefficients are reasonably well described by LDA-1/2 and mBJ when compared to
$G_0W_0$, however, at a much more favorable computational cost.

<h3>CoSb3-based skutterudite nanocomposites prepared by cold sintering  process with enhanced thermoelectric properties</h3>

<i>Aida Serrano, Olga Caballero-Calero, Cecilia Granados-Miralles, Giulio Gorni, Cristina V. Manzano, Marta Rull-Bravo, Alberto Moure, Marisol Martín-González, José F. Fernández</i>
<br>
<br>
We show here for the first time the use of a cold sintering process (CSP) to
sinter CoSb3-based thermoelectric materials. CSP at 150 {\deg}C for 90 min
under a uniaxial pressure of 750 MPa yields pieces with a relative density of
86 %, which is increased to around 92 % after a post-annealing at temperatures
> 500 {\deg}C in Ar atmosphere. The reported CSP produces Te doped-CoSb3
nanocomposites with similar morphological and structural characteristics to the
starting nanopowders obtained by ball milling in air atmosphere. The
post-thermal treatment induces grain coalescence and grain growth, crystallite
size growth as well as compositional changes in the nanocomposite, decreasing
the amount of the main phase, CoSb3, and increasing the weight of secondary
phase, CoSb2, up to a 30 wt% at 600 {\deg}C. Remarkably, the average valence
for the Co, Sb and Te absorbing atoms is neither transformed by the sintering
process nor by the subsequent heat treatment. The functional response of the
sintered thermoelectric nanocomposites exhibits a maximum figure of merit of
0.12(3) at room temperature for the nanocomposites sintered by CSP with a
subsequent post-annealing at 500 {\deg}C. This is mainly due to its low thermal
conductivity in comparison with similar powders sintered by other approaches,
and it is explained by the morphological and structural properties. These
findings represent an attractive alternative for obtaining efficient
thermoelectric skutterudites by a scalable and cost-effective route.

<h3>Coupled oscillator model of a trapped Fermi gas at the BEC-BCS crossover</h3>

<br>
<i>Sergueï V. Andreev</i>
<br>
<br>
We address theoretically the puzzling discontinuity of the radial quadrupole
mode frequency observed in a trapped Fermi gas across the BEC-BCS crossover. We
apply the scaling transformation to a two-channel model of a resonant Fermi
superfluid and argue that the frequency downshift in the crossover region is
due to Feshbach coupling of the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to the
surrounding Fermi sea. The Bose and Fermi components of the gas act as coupled
macroscopic oscillators. The frequency jump corresponds to the point where the
closed-channel molecules are entirely converted into the Fermi sea. This
implies linear scaling of the "critical" detuning between the scattering
channels with the Fermi energy, which can be readily verified in an experiment.

<h3>Robustness of the Random Language Model</h3>

<br>
<i>Fatemeh Lalegani, Eric De Giuli</i>
<br>
<br>
The Random Language Model (De Giuli 2019) is an ensemble of stochastic
context-free grammars, quantifying the syntax of human and computer languages.
The model suggests a simple picture of first language learning as a type of
annealing in the vast space of potential languages. In its simplest
formulation, it implies a single continuous transition to grammatical syntax,
at which the symmetry among potential words and categories is spontaneously
broken. Here this picture is scrutinized by considering its robustness against
explicit symmetry breaking, an inevitable component of learning in the real
world. It is shown that the scenario is robust to such symmetry breaking.
Comparison with human data on the clustering coefficient of syntax networks
suggests that the observed transition is equivalent to that normally
experienced by children at age 24 months.

<h3>Far-from-equilibrium criticality in the Random Field Ising Model with  Eshelby Interactions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a quasi-statically driven random field Ising model (RFIM) at zero
temperature with interactions mediated by the long-range anisotropic Eshelby
kernel. Analogously to amorphous solids at their yielding transition, and
differently from ferromagnetic and dipolar RFIMs, the model shows a
discontinuous magnetization jump associated with the appearance of a band-like
structure for weak disorder and a continuous magnetization growth, yet
punctuated by avalanches, for strong disorder. Through a finite-size scaling
analysis in 2 and 3 dimensions we find that the two regimes are separated by a
finite-disorder critical point which we characterize. We discuss similarities
and differences between the present model and models of sheared amorphous
solids.

<br>
<br>
Structural investigations conducted using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) on LuH2 synthesized under atmospheric pressure (AP-LuH2) and
nitrogen-doped LuH2 synthesized under high pressure (HP-LuH2) have revealed
numerous microstructural phenomena. Both materials show a clear superstructure
modulation with wave vector, q^* = 1/4 (2-20), and this modulation can be well
interpreted by the displacements of Lu atoms. Further investigations on the
nitrogen-doped HP-LuH2 materials reveal the appearance of high-density
antiphase boundaries, in particular, domain walls of a few atomic layer
thickness without structural modulation can be observed, suggesting possible
interface properties could be detected in this system. In-situ TEM observations
of AP-LuH2 suggest that no evident structural phase transition occurs between
94 K and 673 K.

<h3>Perfect Coulomb drag in a dipolar excitonic insulator</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Excitonic insulators (EIs), arising in semiconductors when the electron-hole
binding energy exceeds the band gap, are a solid-state prototype for bosonic
phases of matter. Unlike the charged excitations that are frozen and unable to
transport current, the neutral electron-hole pairs (excitons) are free to move
in EIs. However, it is intrinsically difficult to demonstrate exciton transport
in bulk EI candidates. The recently emerged dipolar EIs based on
Coulomb-coupled atomic double layers open the possibility to realize exciton
transport across the insulator because separate electrical contacts can be made
to the electron and hole layers. Here we show that the strong interlayer
excitonic correlation at equal electron and hole densities in the MoSe2/WSe2
double layers separated by a 2-nm barrier gives rise to perfect Coulomb drag. A
charge current in one layer induces an equal but opposite drag current in the
other. The drag current ratio remains above 0.9 up to about 20 K for low
exciton densities. As exciton density increases above the Mott density, the
excitons dissociate into the electron-hole plasma abruptly, and only weak Fermi
liquid frictional drag is observed. Our experiment moves a step closer to
realizing exciton circuitry and superfluidity.

Using x-ray tomography, we experimentally investigate the nematic transition
in granular spherocylinder packings induced by tapping. Upon the validation of
the Edwards ensemble framework in spherocylinders, we introduce an empirical
free energy that accounts for the influence of gravity and the mechanical
stability requirements specific to granular systems. This free energy can
predict not only the correct phase transition behavior of the system from a
disordered state to a nematic phase, but also a phase coexistence range and
nucleation energy barriers that agree with experimental observations.

In Ref. [1], Minkov et al. reported measurements of the magnetic moment that
remains after a magnetic field is turned on and then turned off for hydride
materials under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell. In Refs. [2,3], Minkov
et al. reported magnetization measurements on the same samples as a function of
applied magnetic field. Here we argue that the latter indicate that the signal
measured in the former does not provide evidence for superconductivity in these
samples. Instead, the measured signal likely originates in ferromagnetism of
either the sample or the background.

Imaging of nanoscale magnetic textures within extended material systems is of
critical importance both to fundamental research and technological
applications. Whilst high resolution magnetic imaging of thin nanoscale samples
is well-established with electron and soft X-ray microscopy, the extension to
micrometer-thick systems with hard X-rays currently limits high resolution
imaging to rare-earth magnets. Here we overcome this limitation by establishing
soft X-ray magnetic imaging of micrometer-thick systems using the pre-edge
phase X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism signal, thus making possible the study
of a wide range of magnetic materials. By performing dichroic
spectro-ptychography, we demonstrate high spatial resolution imaging of
magnetic samples up to 1.7 {\mu}m thick, an order of magnitude higher than
conventionally possible with absorption-based techniques. This new regime of
magnetic imaging makes possible the study of extended non rare-earth systems
that have until now been inaccessible, from magnetic textures for future
spintronic applications to non-rare-earth permanent magnets.

It is frequently hypothesized that cortical networks operate close to a
critical point. Advantages of criticality include rich dynamics well-suited for
computation and critical slowing down, which may offer a mechanism for dynamic
memory. However, mean-field approximations, while versatile and popular,
inherently neglect the fluctuations responsible for such critical dynamics.
Thus, a renormalized theory is necessary. We consider the
Sompolinsky-Crisanti-Sommers model which displays a well studied chaotic as
well as a magnetic transition. Based on the analogue of a quantum effective
action, we derive self-consistency equations for the first two renormalized
Greens functions. Their self-consistent solution reveals a coupling between the
population level activity and single neuron heterogeneity. The quantitative
theory explains the population autocorrelation function, the single-unit
autocorrelation function with its multiple temporal scales, and cross
correlations.

<br>
<br>
Understanding the physics of a three-phase contact line between gas, liquid,
and solid is important for numerous applications. At the macroscale, the
three-phase contact line response to an external force action is often
characterized by a contact angle hysteresis, and several models are presented
in the literature for its description. Yet, there is still a need for more
information about such model applications at the nanoscale. In this study, a
molecular dynamics approach was used to investigate the shape of a liquid
droplet under an external force for different wetting regimes. In addition, an
analytic model for describing the droplet shape was developed. It gives us the
possibility to evaluate the receding and advancing wetting angle accurately.
With our modeling, we found that the interplay between capillary forces and
viscous forces is crucial to characterize the droplet shape at the nanoscale.
In this frame, the importance of the rolling movement of the interface between
liquid and vapor was pointed out. We also demonstrate that in the range of the
external forces when capillary forces are most significant compared to others,
hysteresis is well described by the macroscale Cox-Voinov model.

<br>
<br>
We propose a new avenue in which percolation, which has been much associated
with critical phase transitions, can also dictate the asymptotic dynamics of
non-Hermitian systems by breaking PT symmetry. Central to it is our
newly-designed mechanism of topologically guided gain, where chiral edge
wavepackets in a bilayer topological system experience non-Hermitian gain or
loss based on how they are topologically steered. For sufficiently wide
topological islands, this leads to irreversible growth due to positive feedback
from inter-layer tunneling. As such, a percolation transition that merges small
topo islands into larger ones also drives the edge spectrum across a real to
complex transition. Our discovery showcases intriguing dynamical consequences
from the triple interplay of chiral topology, directed gain and inter-layer
tunneling, and suggests new routes for topology to be harnessed in the control
of feedback systems.

Slow fluctuations of Overhauser fields are an important source for
decoherence in spin qubits hosted in III-V semiconductor quantum dots. Focusing
on the effect of the field gradient on double-dot singlet-triplet qubits, we
present two adaptive Bayesian schemes to estimate the magnitude of the gradient
by a series of free induction decay experiments. We concentrate on reducing the
computational overhead, with a real-time implementation of the schemes in mind.
We show how it is possible to achieve a significant improvement of estimation
accuracy compared to more traditional estimation methods. We include an
analysis of the effects of dephasing and the drift of the gradient itself.

Quantum emitters in two-dimensional layered hexagonal boron nitride are
quickly emerging as a highly promising platform for next-generation quantum
technologies. However, precise identification and control of defects are key
parameters to achieve the next step in their development. We conducted a
comprehensive study by analyzing over 10,000 photoluminescence emission lines,
revealing 11 distinct defect families within the 1.6 to 2.2 eV energy range.
This challenges hypotheses of a random energy distribution. We also reported
averaged defect parameters, including emission linewidths, spatial density,
phonon side bands, and the Debye-Waller factors. These findings provide
valuable insights to decipher the microscopic origin of emitters in hBN hosts.
We also explored the influence of hBN host morphology on defect family
formation, demonstrating its crucial impact. By tuning flake size and
arrangement we achieve selective control of defect types while maintaining high
spatial density. This offers a scalable approach to defect emission control,
diverging from costly engineering methods. It highlights the importance of
investigating flake morphological control to gain deeper insights into the
origins of defects and to expand the spectral tailoring capabilities of defects
in hBN.

Nonequilibrium phase transitions are notably difficult to analyze because
their mechanisms depend on the system's dynamics in a complex way due to the
lack of time-reversal symmetry. To complicate matters, the system's
steady-state distribution is unknown in general. Here, the phase diagram of the
active Model B is computed with a deep neural network implementation of the
geometric minimum action method (gMAM). This approach unveils the
unconventional reaction paths and nucleation mechanism by which the system
switches between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases in the binodal
region. Our main findings are: (i) the mean time to escape the phase-separated
state is (exponentially) extensive in the system size $L$, but it increases
non-monotonically with $L$; (ii) the mean time to escape the homogeneous state
is always finite, in line with the recent work of Cates and Nardini~[Phys. Rev.
Lett. 130, 098203]; (iii) at fixed $L$, the active term increases the stability
of the homogeneous phase, eventually destroying the phase separation in the
binodal for large but finite systems. Our results are particularly relevant for
active matter systems in which the number of constituents hardly goes beyond
$10^7$ and where finite-size effects matter.

We find the single exciton's fine structure splitting (FSS), which splits its
degenerate ground state manifold into singlets, nearly vanishes in highly
asymmetric quantum dots due to the cancellation of splitting effects with
markedly different origin. The dots simulated are those that emerge on top of
etch pits through the droplet epitaxy growth process; these etch pit dots break
square ($C_{4v}$) spatial symmetry, which has been previously associated with
small FSS. Configuration interaction calculations predict a vanishing FSS at a
specific finite etch pit displacement from the center of the dot, for a
structure far from square symmetry. We thus predict that highly asymmetric
quantum dots may still display negligible fine structure splitting, providing
new avenues for high-fidelity generation of indistinguishable, polarization
entangled photon pairs on demand.

Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity with $T_c \sim 80$ K
in pressurized La3Ni2O7 [Nature 621, 493 (2023)], we explore the structural and
electronic properties in A3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates (A=La-Lu, Y, Sc) as a
function of hydrostatic pressure (0-150 GPa) from first principles including a
Coulomb repulsion term. At $\sim 20$ GPa, we observe an
orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at variance with
recent x-ray diffraction data, which points to so-far unresolved complexities
at the onset of superconductivity, e.g., charge doping by variations in the
oxygen stoichiometry. We compile a structural phase diagram with particular
emphasis on the $b/a$ ratio, octahedral anisotropy, and octahedral rotations.
Intriguingly, chemical and external pressure emerge as two distinct and
counteracting control parameters. We find unexpected correlations between $T_c$
and the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, two novel
structural phases with significant $c^+$ octahedral rotations and in-plane bond
disproportionations are uncovered for A=Nd-Lu, Y, Sc that exhibit a surprising
pressure-driven electronic reconstruction in the Ni $e_g$ manifold. By
disentangling the involvement of basal versus apical oxygen states at the Fermi
surface, we identify Tb$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an interesting candidate for
superconductivity at ambient pressure. These results suggest a profound
tunability of the structural and electronic phases in this novel materials
class and are key for a fundamental understanding of the superconductivity
mechanism.

<h3>Strong pairing from doping-induced Feshbach resonance and second Fermi  liquid through doping a bilayer spin-one Mott insulator: application to  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

We study the physics of doping a bilayer spin-one Mott insulator with $S=1$
moment formed by $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, motivated by the
superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. When the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is Mott
localized, the itinerant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital inherits a large inter-layer
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\perp$, but we show here that a one-orbital
bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_\perp$ model for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital only misses
the important ingredients of polaron formation between hole in $d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbital and local spin moment from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. We argue that the
minimal model should be the type II t-J model proposed by the two of us.
Through DMRG calculation of the type II t-J model in a two-leg ladder
configuration ($L_z=2$, $L_y=1$, $L_x\rightarrow \infty$), we find that the
pairing gap increases with hole doping $x$ (per site per layer) until $x
\approx 0.5$ and then decreases, in contrast to the conventional t-J model.

Many magnetic materials are predicted to exhibit bosonic topological edge
modes in their excitation spectra, because of the nontrivial topology of their
magnon, triplon or other quasi-particle band structures. However, there is a
discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which
suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected
experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions
that are not accounted for in the non-interacting quasi-particle picture are
most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge
modes. Here we report stable bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder
quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full
many-body interaction. For the first time, we use tensor network methods to
resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and
the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We
further show that these edge modes have anomalously long time coherence,
discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the
fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material
candidates.

We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological
quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with
all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or
non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general
symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may
contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to
all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice
systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies.
We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian
Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$
symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times
U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times
SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$,
$p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$,
$p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively.
In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids
that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including
examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.
