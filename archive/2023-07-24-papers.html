Controlled charge flows are fundamental to many areas of science and
technology, serving as carriers of energy and information, as probes of
material properties and dynamics, and as a means of revealing or even inducing
broken symmetries. Emerging methods for light-based current control offer
promising routes beyond the speed and adaptability limitations of conventional
voltage-driven systems. However, optical manipulation of currents at nanometer
spatial scales remains a basic challenge and a key step toward scalable
optoelectronic systems and local probes. Here, we introduce vectorial
optoelectronic metasurfaces as a new class of metamaterial in which ultrafast
charge flows are driven by light pulses, with actively-tunable directionality
and arbitrary patterning down to sub-diffractive nanometer scales. In the
prototypical metasurfaces studied herein, asymmetric plasmonic nanoantennas
locally induce directional, linear current responses within underlying
graphene. Nanoscale unit cell symmetries are read out via polarization- and
wavelength-sensitive currents and emitted terahertz (THz) radiation. Global
vectorial current distributions are revealed by spatial mapping of the THz
field polarization, also demonstrating the direct generation of elusive
broadband THz vector beams. We show that a detailed interplay between
electrodynamic, thermodynamic, and hydrodynamic degrees of freedom gives rise
to these currents through rapidly-evolving nanoscale forces and charge flows
under extreme spatial and temporal localization. These results set the stage
for versatile patterning and optical control over nanoscale currents in
materials diagnostics, nano-magnetism, microelectronics, and ultrafast
information science.

<h3>RÃ©nyi negativities in non-equilibrium open free-boson chains</h3>

In this paper, we consider the dynamics of R\'enyi negativities after a
quantum quench in the free-boson chain with homogeneous dissipation. Initially
we prepare the system in the squeezed thermal state, and then let it evolves
under the tight-binding bosonic Hamiltonian with local linear dissipation. We
use the Lindblad equation to solve the time evolution of the covariance matrix,
from which one can obtain the time dependence of R\'enyi negativities. We are
interested in the weak dissipation hydrodynamic limit where a quasi-particle
picture emerges. In this limit, exact results of non-equilibrium dynamics of
R\'enyi negativities can be obtained using the stationary phase method. We
consider the R\'enyi negativities between both adjacent and disjoint regions in
a infinite chain. We numerically test our analytical predictions and perfect
matches have found.

<h3>Dynamics of a Passive Droplet in Active Turbulence</h3>

<br>
<i>Chamkor Singh, Abhishek Chaudhuri</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically study the effect of an active turbulent environment on a
passive deformable droplet. The system is simulated using coupled hydrodynamic
and nematodynamic equations for nematic liquid crystals with an active stress
which is non-zero outside the droplet, and is zero inside. The droplet
undergoes deformation fluctuations and its movement shows periods of ``runs"
and ``stays". The mean square displacement of the geometric center of the
droplet shows an extended ballistic regime and a transition to normal diffusive
regime which depends on the size of the droplet. We relate this transition with
a temporal scale associated with velocity autocorrelation function of the
droplet trajectories, and with a spatial scale associated with one-time
two-point velocity correlation function of the surrounding active medium. As
the radius is decreased below the integral length scale, the velocity
autocorrelation time of trajectories increases and the transition to normal
diffusion is delayed.

<h3>Protein sizing with Differential Dynamic Microscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Introduced more than fifty years ago, dynamic light scattering is routinely
used to determine the size distribution of colloidal suspensions, as well as of
macromolecules in solution, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and their
complexes. More recently, differential dynamic microscopy has been proposed as
a way to perform dynamic light scattering experiments with a microscope, with
much less stringent constraints in terms of cleanliness of the optical
surfaces, but a potentially lower sensitivity due to the use of camera-based
detectors. In this work, we push bright-field differential dynamic microscopy
beyond known limits and show it to be sufficiently sensitive to size small
macromolecules in diluted solutions. By considering solutions of three
different proteins (Bovine Serum Albumin, Lysozyme, and Pepsin), we accurately
determine the diffusion coefficient and hydrodynamic radius of both single
proteins and small protein aggregates down to concentrations of a few
milligrams per milliliter. In addition, we present preliminary results showing
unexplored potential for the determination of virial coefficients. Our results
are in excellent agreement with the ones obtained in parallel with a
state-of-the-art commercial dynamic light scattering setup, showing that
differential dynamic microscopy represents a valuable alternative for rapid,
label-free protein sizing with an optical microscope.

<h3>Phonon damping in a 2D superfluid: insufficiency of Fermi's golden rule  at low temperature</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is generally accepted that the phonon gas of a superfluid always enters a
weak coupling regime at sufficiently low temperatures, whatever the strength of
the interactions between the underlying particles (constitutive of the
superfluid). Thus, in this limit, we should always be able to calculate the
damping rate of thermal phonons by applying Fermi's golden rule to the $H\_3$
Hamiltonian of cubic phonon-phonon coupling taken from quantum hydrodynamics,
at least in the case of a convex acoustic branch and in the collisionless
regime (where the eigenfrequency of the considered phonons remains much greater
than the gas thermalization rate). Using the many-body Green's function method,
we predict that, unexpectedly, this is not true in two dimensions, contrary to
the three-dimensional case. We confirm this prediction with classical
phonon-field simulations and a non-perturbative theory in $H\_3$, where the
fourth order is regularized by hand, giving a complex energy to the virtual
phonons of the four-phonon collisional processes. For a weakly interacting
fluid and a phonon mode in the long-wavelength limit, we predict a damping rate
about three times lower than that of the golden rule.

<h3>Flow states of two dimensional active gels driven by external shear</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12910</a>
<br>
<i>Wan Luo, Aparna Baskaran, Robert A. Pelcovits, Thomas R. Powers</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a minimal hydrodynamic model, we theoretically and computationally
study active gels in straight and annular two-dimensional channels subject to
an externally imposed shear. The gels are isotropic in the absence of
externally- or activity-driven shear, but have nematic order that increases
with shear rate. Using the finite element method, we determine the possible
flow states for a range of activities and shear rates. Linear stability
analysis of an unconfined gel in a straight channel shows that an externally
imposed shear flow can stabilize an extensile fluid that would be unstable to
spontaneous flow in the absence of the shear flow, and destabilize a
contractile fluid that would be stable against spontaneous flow in the absence
of shear flow. These results are in rough agreement with the stability
boundaries between the base shear flow state and the nonlinear flow states that
we find numerically for a confined active gel. For extensile fluids, we find
three kinds of nonlinear flow states in the range of parameters we study:
unidirectional flows, oscillatory flows, and dancing flows. To highlight the
activity-driven spontaneous component of the nonlinear flows, we characterize
these states by the average volumetric flow rate and the wall stress. For
contractile fluids, we only find the linear shear flow and a nonlinear
unidirectional flow in the range of parameters that we studied. For large
magnitudes of the activity, the unidirectional contractile flow develops a
boundary layer. Our analysis of annular channels shows how curvature of the
streamlines in the base flow affects the transitions among flow states.

<h3>Collective epithelial migration is mediated by the unbinding of hexatic  defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12956" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12956</a>

<br>
Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: i.e. a
local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to
swap their positions. While in common with foams and other passive cellular
fluids, intercalation in epithelia crucially depends on active processes, where
the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein
conspire to produce an ``avalanche'' of remodelling events, which collectively
give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we
formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon
recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered)
structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and
cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation
takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by
fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between
passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light
on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in
epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in
vitro epithelial layers.

<h3>Unraveling the role of interactions in non-equilibrium transformations</h3>

<br>
<i>Maria Rose, Sreekanth K Manikandan</i>
<br>
<br>
For arbitrary non-equilibrium transformations in complex systems, we show
that the distance between the current state and a target state can be
decomposed into two terms: one corresponding to an \textit{independent}
estimate of the distance, and another corresponding to interactions, quantified
using the relative mutual information between the variables. This decomposition
is a special case of a more general decomposition involving successive orders
of correlation or interactions among the system's degrees of freedom. To
illustrate its practical significance, we study the thermalization of two
optically trapped colloidal particles with hydrodynamic coupling. Our results
show that, increasing pairwise interaction strength enhances the separation
between the time-dependent non-equilibrium state and the final state,
prolonging the non-equilibrium state's longevity. In more general setups, where
it is possible to control the strength of different orders of interactions, our
findings offer a way to disentangle their effects on the transformation
process.

<h3>Using dark solitons from a Bose-Einstein condensate necklace to imprint  soliton states in the spectral memory of a free boson gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11803" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11803</a>
<br>
<i>Alain M. Dikande</i>
<br>
<br>
A possible use of matter-wave dark-soliton crystal produced by a
Bose-Einstein condensate with ring geometry, to store soliton states in the
quantum memory of a free boson gas, is explored. A self-defocusing nonlinearity
combined with dispersion and the finite size of the Bose-Einstein condensate,
favor the creation of dark-soliton crystals that imprint quantum states with
Jacobi elliptic-type soliton wavefunctions in the spectrum of the free boson
gas. The problem is formulated by considering the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
with a positive scattering length, coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation
for the free boson gas. With the help of the matter-wave dark soliton-crystal
solution, the spectrum of bound states created in the free boson gas is shown
to be determined by the Lam\'e eigenvalue problem. This spectrum consists of
$\vert \nu, \mathcal{L} \rangle$ quantum states whose wave functions and energy
eigenvalues can be unambiguously identified. Among these eigenstates some have
their wave functions that are replicas of the generating dark soliton crystal.

<h3>Complex magnetic and spatial symmetry breaking from correlations in  kagome flat bands</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present the mean-field phase diagram of electrons in a kagome flat band
with repulsive interactions. In addition to flat-band ferromagnetism, the
Hartree-Fock analysis yields cascades of unconventional magnetic orders driven
by onsite repulsion as filling changes. These include a series of
antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-charge stripe orders, as well as an evolution from
$120^\circ$AFM to intriguing noncoplanar spin orders with tetrahedral
structures. We also map out the phase diagram under extended repulsion at half
and empty fillings of the flat band. To examine the possibilities beyond
mean-field level, we conduct a projective symmetry group analysis and identify
the feasible $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquids and the magnetic orders derivable from
them. The theoretical phase diagrams are compared with recent experiments on
FeSn and FeGe, enabling determination of the most likely magnetic instabilities
in these and similar kagome flat-band materials.

<h3>Gaussian state approximation of quantum many-body scars</h3>

<br>
<i>Wouter Buijsman, Yevgeny Bar Lev</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum many-body scars are atypical, highly nonthermal eigenstates of
kinetically constrained systems embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. These
special eigenstates are characterized, for example, by a bipartite entanglement
entropy that scales as most logarithmically with subsystem size. We use
numerical optimization techniques to investigate if quantum many-body scars of
the experimentally relevant PXP model are well approximated by Gaussian states.
These states are described by a number of parameters that scales quadratically
with system size, thereby having a much lower complexity than generic quantum
many-body states. We find that this is a good description for the quantum
many-body scars away from the center of the spectrum.

<h3>Fragmented superconductivity in the Hubbard model as solitons in  Ginzburg-Landau theory</h3>

<br>
<i>NiccolÃ² Baldelli, Benedikt Kloss, Matthew Fishman, Alexander Wietek</i>
<br>
<br>
The phenomena of superconductivity and charge density waves are observed in
close vicinity in many strongly correlated materials. Increasing evidence from
experiments and numerical simulations suggests both phenomena can also occur in
an intertwined manner, where the superconducting order parameter is coupled to
the electronic density. Employing density matrix renormalization group
simulations, we investigate the nature of such an intertwined state of matter
stabilized in the phase diagram of the elementary $t$-$t^\prime$-$U$ Hubbard
model in the strong coupling regime. Remarkably, the condensate of Cooper pairs
is shown to be fragmented in the presence of a charge density wave where more
than one pairing wave function is macroscopically occupied. Moreover, we
provide conclusive evidence that the macroscopic wave functions of the
superconducting fragments are well-described by soliton solutions of a
Ginzburg-Landau equation in a periodic potential constituted by the charge
density wave. In the presence of an orbital magnetic field, the order
parameters are gauge invariant, and superconducting vortices are pinned between
the stripes. This intertwined Ginzburg-Landau theory is proposed as an
effective low-energy description of the stripe fragmented superconductor.

<h3>Obstructed swelling and fracture of hydrogels</h3>

<br>
<br>
Obstructions influence the growth and expansion of bodies in a wide range of
settings -- but isolating and understanding their impact can be difficult in
complex environments. Here, we study obstructed growth/expansion in a model
system accessible to experiments, simulations, and theory: hydrogels swelling
around fixed cylindrical obstacles with varying geometries. When the obstacles
are large and widely-spaced, hydrogels swell around them and remain intact. In
contrast, our experiments reveal that when the obstacles are narrow and
closely-spaced, hydrogels unexpectedly fracture as they swell. We use finite
element simulations to map the magnitude and spatial distribution of stresses
that build up during swelling at equilibrium, providing a route toward
predicting when this phenomenon of self-fracturing is likely to arise. Applying
lessons from indentation theory, poroelasticity, and nonlinear continuum
mechanics, we also develop a theoretical framework for understanding how the
maximum principal tensile and compressive stresses that develop during swelling
are controlled by obstacle geometry and material parameters. These results thus
help to shed light on the mechanical principles underlying growth/expansion in
environments with obstructions.

<h3>Wavelength Dependence of the Electrical and Optical Readout of NV  Centers in Diamond</h3>

We study the contrast for electrical and optical readout of NV centers in
diamond in dependence of the optical excitation wavelength using different
excitation schemes. While the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
works efficiently between 480 and 580 nm, electrically detected magnetic
resonance (EDMR) shows a strong dependence on the excitation dynamics. The
highest, electrically detected contrast of -23% is achieved by resonantly
exciting the zero-phonon line of the neutral charge state of NV at 575 nm. EDMR
is also enhanced at 521 nm, possibly due to a further excited state of NV$^-$.

<h3>Data-Induced Interactions of Sparse Sensors</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently has
low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few
eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially
localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex
system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of
sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the
sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization
have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm
that outputs a singular "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a thermodynamic
view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the
training data. The landscape takes the form of the Ising model in statistical
physics, and accounts for both the data variance captured at each sensor
location and the crosstalk between sensors. Mapping out these data-induced
sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and
anticipating sensor replacement impacts.

<h3>First-principles Calculations of MoSeTe/WSeTe Bilayers: Stability,  Phonons, Electronic Band Offsets, and Rashba Splitting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11839" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11839</a>
<br>
<i>Hamid Mehdipour, Peter Kratzer</i>
<br>
<br>
Janus materials have attracted much interest due to their intrinsic electric
dipole moment which, among other consequences, triggers Rashba band splitting.
We show that, by building bilayers of MoSeTe and WSeTe with different chalcogen
atom sequences and different stacking patterns, one can modulate the net dipole
moment strength and thus the Rashba effect, as well as the band alignment of
the MoSeTe/WSeTe bilayer. Type-II band alignment is found which can be
exploited to create long-lived interlayer excitons. Moreover, it is shown that
the atomic sequence and stacking play pivotal roles in the interlayer distance
of MoSeTe/WSeTe and thus its electronic structure and vibrational, especially
low-frequency, characteristics. The long-range dispersion forces between atoms
are treated with a conventional additive pairwise, as well as a
many-body-dispersion method. It is shown that under the many-body dispersion
method, more clear and rational thermodynamic trends of bilayer stacking are
realized and interface distances are estimated more accurately. Vibrational
spectra of the bilayers are calculated using first-principles phonon
calculations and the fingerprints of monolayer attraction and repulsion are
identified. An anti-correlation between distance and the shearing mode
frequency of the rigid monolayers is demonstrated which agrees well with
experimental findings. The results suggest that the judicious selection of the
atomic sequence and stacking helps to widen the scope of the low-dimensional
materials by adding or enhancing properties for specific applications, e.g. for
spintronics or valleytronics devices.

<h3>Frustrated charge order and cooperative distortions in ScV6Sn6</h3>

<br>
<br>
Here we study the stability of charge order in the kagome metal ScV6Sn6.
Synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements reveal high-temperature, short-range
charge correlations at the wave vectors along q=(1/3,1/3,1/2) whose inter-layer
correlation lengths diverge upon cooling. At the charge order transition, this
divergence is interrupted and long-range order freezes in along
q=(1/3,1/3,1/3), as previously reported, while disorder enables the charge
correlations to persist at the q=(1/3,1/3,1/2) wave vector down to the lowest
temperatures measured. Both short-range and long-range charge correlations
seemingly arise from the same instability and both are rapidly quenched upon
the introduction of larger Y ions onto the Sc sites. Our results validate the
theoretical prediction of the primary lattice instability at q=(1/3,1/3,1/2),
and we present a heuristic picture for viewing the frustration of charge order
in this compound.

<h3>Illumination protocols for non-linear phononics in bismuth and antimony</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the optical generation and control of coherent phonons in elemental
bismuth (Bi) and antimony (Sb) using a classical equation of motion informed by
first-principles calculations of the potential energy surface and the
frequency-dependent macroscopic dielectric function along the zone-centered
optical phonons coordinates. Using this approach, we demonstrate that phonons
with the largest optomechanical couplings, also have the strongest degree of
anharmonicity, a result of the broken symmetry structural ground state of Bi
and Sb. We show how this anharmonicity, explaining the light-induced phonon
softening observed in experiments, prevents the application of standard
phonon-amplification and annihilation protocols. We introduce a simple
linearization protocol that extends the use of such protocols to the case of
anharmonic phonons in broken symmetry materials, and demonstrate its efficiency
at high displacement amplitudes. Our formalism and results provide a path for
improving optical control in non-linear phononics.

We study the temperature-dependent optical properties of gold over a broad
energy spectrum covering photon energies below and above the interband
threshold. We apply a semi-analytical Drude-Lorentz model with
temperature-dependent oscillator parameters. Our approximations are based on
the distribution of electrons over the active bands with a density of states
provided by density functional theory. This model can be easily adapted to
other materials with similar band structures and can also be applied to the
case of occupational nonequilibrium. Our calculations show a strong enhancement
of the intraband response with increasing electron temperature while the
interband component decreases. Moreover, our model compares well with density
functional theory-based calculations for the reflectivity of highly excited
gold and reproduces many of its key features. Applying our methods to thin
films shows a sensitive nonlinear dependence of the reflection and absorption
on the electron temperature. These features are more prominent at small photon
energies and can be highlighted with polarized light. Our findings offer
valuable insights for modeling ultrafast processes, in particular, the pathways
of energy deposition in laser-excited samples.

<h3>Higher-order Topological Point State</h3>

<br>
<br>
Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) have attracted increasing
interest as a unique class of topological quantum materials. One distinct
property of HOTIs is the crystalline symmetry-imposed topological state at the
lower-dimensional outer boundary, e.g. the zero-dimensional (0D) corner state
of a 2D HOTI, used exclusively as a universal signature to identify
higher-order topology but yet with uncertainty. Strikingly, we discover the
existence of inner topological point states (TPS) in a 2D HOTI, as the embedded
"end" states of 1D first-order TI, as exemplified by those located at the
vacancies in a Kekule lattice. Significantly, we demonstrate that such inner
TPS can be unambiguously distinguished from the trivial point-defect states, by
their unique topology-endowed inter-TPS interaction and correlated magnetic
response in spectroscopy measurements, overcoming an outstanding experimental
challenge. Furthermore, based on first-principles calculations, we propose
{\gamma}-graphyne as a promising material to observe the higher-order TPS. Our
findings shed new light on our fundamental understanding of HOTIs, and also
open an avenue to experimentally distinguishing and tuning TPS in the interior
of a 2D sample for potential applications.

Quasicrystal (QC) has no periodicity but has a unique rotational symmetry
forbidden in periodic crystals. Lack of microscopic theory of the crystalline
electric field (CEF) in the QC and approximant crystal (AC) has prevented us
from understanding the electric property, especially the magnetism. By
developing the general formulation of the CEF in the rare-earth based QC and
AC, we have analyzed the CEF in the QC Au-SM-Tb and AC (SM=Si, Ge, and Ga). The
magnetic anisotropy arising from the CEF plays an important role in realizing
unique magnetic states on the icosahedron (IC). By constructing the minimal
model with the magnetic anisotropy, we have analyzed the ground-state
properties of the IC, 1/1 AC, and QC. The hedgehog state is characterized by
the topological charge of one and the whirling-moment state is characterized by
the topological charge of three. The uniform arrangement of the ferrimagnetic
state is stabilized in the QC with the ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, which is
a candidate for the magnetic structure recently observed FM long-range order in
the QC Au-Ga-Tb. The uniform arrangement of the hedgehog state is stabilized in
the QC with the antiferromagnetic interaction, which suggests the possibility
of the topological magnetic long-range order.

This paper presents the investigation of convolutional neural network (CNN)
prediction successfully recognizing the temperature of the non-equilibrium
phases and phase transitions in two-dimensional (2D) Ising spins on
square-lattice. The model uses image snapshots of ferromagnetic 2D spin
configurations as an input shape to provide the average out put predictions. By
considering supervised machine learning techniques, we perform the (modified)
Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to generate the equilibrium (and
non-equilibrium) configurations. In equilibrium Ising model, the Metropolis
algorithm respects detailed balance condition (DBC), while its modified
non-equilibrium version violates the DBC. Violating the DBC of the algorithm is
characterized by a parameter $-8 < \varepsilon < 8$. We find the exact result
of the transition temperature in terms of $\varepsilon$. This solution is used
to encode the two (high-and low-temperature) phases through an order parameter
of the model. If we set $\varepsilon = 0$, the usual single spin flip algorithm
can be restored and the equilibrium configurations (training dataset) generated
with such set up are used to train our model. For $\varepsilon \neq 0$, the
system attains the non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), and the modified
algorithm generates NESS configurations (test dataset), not defined by
Boltzmann distribution. Finally, the trained model has been validated and
successfully tested on the test dataset. Our result shows that CNN can
correctly determine the nonequilibrium phase transition temperature $T_c$ for
various $\varepsilon$ values, consistent with the exact result (our study) and
also in agreement with MC result (literature).

Robust spin-photon interfaces in solids are essential components in quantum
networking and sensing technologies. Ideally, these interfaces combine a
long-lived spin memory, coherent optical transitions, fast and high-fidelity
spin manipulation, and straightforward device integration and scaling. The
tin-vacancy center (SnV) in diamond is a promising spin-photon interface with
desirable optical and spin properties at 1.7 K. However, the SnV spin lacks
efficient microwave control and its spin coherence degrades with higher
temperature. In this work, we introduce a new platform that overcomes these
challenges - SnV centers in uniformly strained thin diamond membranes. The
controlled generation of crystal strain introduces orbital mixing that allows
microwave control of the spin state with 99.36(9) % gate fidelity and spin
coherence protection beyond a millisecond. Moreover, the presence of crystal
strain suppresses temperature dependent dephasing processes, leading to a
considerable improvement of the coherence time up to 223(10) ${\mu}$s at 4 K, a
widely accessible temperature in common cryogenic systems. Critically, the
coherence of optical transitions is unaffected by the elevated temperature,
exhibiting nearly lifetime-limited optical linewidths. Combined with the
compatibility of diamond membranes with device integration, the demonstrated
platform is an ideal spin-photon interface for future quantum technologies.

<br>
<br>
We report magnetic and transport properties of single-crystalline
EuZn$_{2}$P$_{2}$, which has trigonal CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type crystal structure and
orders antiferromagnetically at $\approx$23~K. Easy $ab$-plane
magneto-crystalline anisotropy was confirmed from the magnetization isotherms,
measured with a magnetic field applied along different crystallographic
directions ($ab$-plane and $c$-axis). Positive Curie-Weiss temperature
indicates dominating ferromagnetic correlations. Electrical resistivity
displays insulating behavior with a band-gap of $\approx\,$0.177~eV, which
decreases to $\approx\,$0.13~eV upon application of a high magnetic field. We
explained the intriguing presence of magnetic interactions in an intermetallic
insulator by the mechanism of extended superexchange, with phosphorus as an
anion mediator, which is further supported by our analysis of the charge and
spin density distributions. We constructed the effective Heisenberg model, with
exchange parameters derived from the \textit{ab initio} DFT calculations, and
employed it in Monte-Carlo simulations, which correctly reproduced the
experimental value of N\'eel temperature.

We study a microscopic model for four spinless fermions on the square lattice
which exhibits a quartet bound state in the strong coupling regime. The
four-particle quantum states are analyzed using symmetry arguments and by
introducing a zoo of relevant lattice animals. These considerations, as well as
variational and exact diagonalization calculations demonstrate the existence of
a narrow quartet band at small hopping and a first order transition to
delocalized fermions at a critical hopping parameter, in qualitative contrast
to, e. g., the BCS-BEC crossover in the attractive Hubbard model. In the case
of pure attraction, an intermediate phase is found, in which a more extended
and presumably more mobile hybrid quartet dominates the ground state. We
comment on the relevance of the spin degree of freedom and on the reasons why
electron quartetting is rarely observed in real materials.

Synthetic nanomotors powered by chemical reactions have been designed to act
as vehicles for active cargo transport, drug delivery as well as a variety of
other uses. Collections of such motors, acting in consort, can self-assemble to
form swarms or clusters, providing opportunities for applications on various
length scales. While such collective behavior has been studied when the motors
move in a chemically inactive fluid environment, when the medium in which they
move is a chemical network that supports complex spatial and temporal patterns
we show that collective behavior changes. Spatial patterns in the environment
can guide and control motor collective states, and interactions of the motors
with their environment can give rise to distinctive spatiotemporal motor
patterns. The results are illustrated by studies of the motor dynamics in
systems that support Turing patterns and spiral waves. This work is relevant
for potential applications that involve many active nanomotors moving in
complex chemical or biological environments.

We study theoretically the effect of electronic interactions in 1d systems on
electron injection using periodic Lorentzian pulses, known as Levitons. We
consider specifically a system composed of a metallic single-wall carbon
nanotube, described with the Luttinger liquid formalism, a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) tip, and metallic leads. Using the out-of-equilibrium Keldysh
Green function formalism, we compute the current and current noise in the
system. We prove that the excess noise vanishes when each Leviton injects an
integer number of electrons from the STM tip into the nanotube. This extends
the concept of minimal injection with Levitons to strongly correlated,
uni-dimensional non-chiral systems. We also study the time-dependent current
profile, and show how it is the result of interferences between pulses
non-trivially reflected at the nanotube/lead interface.

<br>
<br>
When viewed with a cross-polarized optical microscope (POM), liquid crystals
display interference colors and complex patterns that depend on the material's
microscopic orientation. That orientation can be manipulated by application of
external fields, which provides the basis for applications in optical display
and sensing technologies. The color patterns themselves have a high information
content. Traditionally, however, calculations of the optical appearance of
liquid crystals have been performed by assuming that a single-wavelength light
source is employed, and reported in a monochromatic scale. In this work, the
original Jones matrix method is extended to calculate the colored images that
arise when a liquid crystal is exposed to a multi-wavelength source. By
accounting for the material properties, the visible light spectrum and the CIE
color matching functions, we demonstrate that the proposed approach produces
colored POM images that are in quantitative agreement with experimental data.
Results are presented for a variety of systems, including radial, bipolar, and
cholesteric droplets, where results of simulations are compared to experimental
microscopy images. The effects of droplet size, topological defect structure,
and droplet orientation are examined systematically. The technique introduced
here generates images that can be directly compared to experiments, thereby
facilitating machine learning efforts aimed at interpreting LC microscopy
images, and paving the way for the inverse design of materials capable of
producing specific internal microstructures in response to external stimuli.

When intense light is shone through a transparent medium, the strong,
time-periodic potential from the radiation field reshapes the many-body
Hamiltonian. Crucially, this interaction does not involve light absorption and,
in principle, does not generate any heat. The incident radiation can
nonetheless be used to optically tailor various degrees of freedom, leading to
the possibility of photo-controlling macroscopic properties of matter. Here, we
show that when inversion symmetry is broken by the antiferromganetic spin
arrangement in Cr$_2$O$_3$, transmitting linearly polarized light through the
crystal gives rise to a purely electronic dipole moment by way of a two-photon
Stark effect. Using interferometric time-resolved second harmonic generation,
we show that the threefold rotational symmetry of the crystal is broken only
while the pump pulse is present; the timescale indicates that an electronic
response is generated without affecting the magnetic or crystal structures. The
orientation of the induced moment depends on the incident light polarization,
which allows for contact-free control of the dipole moment vector. Our results
establish a dissipationless optical protocol by which to selectively polarize
the electronic subsystem and provides a method to manipulate electronic
symmetries in noncentrosymmetric insulators.

<h3>The mechanical response of fire ant rafts</h3>

Fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) cohesively aggregate via the formation of
voluntary ant-to-ant attachments when under confinement or exposed to water.
Once formed, these aggregations act as viscoelastic solids due to dynamic bond
exchange between neighboring ants as demonstrated by rate-dependent mechanical
response of 3D aggregations, confined in rheometers. We here investigate the
mechanical response of 2D, planar ant rafts roughly as they form in nature.
Specifically, we load rafts under uniaxial tension to failure, as well as to
50% strain for two cycles with various recovery times between. We do so while
measuring raft reaction force (to estimate network-scale stress), as well as
the networks' instantaneous velocity fields and topological damage responses to
elucidate the ant-scale origins of global mechanics. The rafts display
brittle-like behavior even at slow strain rates (relative to the unloaded bond
detachment rate) for which Transient Network Theory predicts steady-state
creep. This provides evidence that loaded ant-to-ant bonds undergo
mechanosensitive bond stabilization or act as \say{catch bonds}. This is
further supported by the coalescence of voids that nucleate due to biaxial
stress conditions and merge due to bond dissociation. The characteristic
timescales of void coalescence due to chain dissociation provide evidence that
the local detachment of stretched bonds is predominantly strain- (as opposed to
bond lifetime-) dependent, even at slow strain rates, implying that bond
detachment rates diminish significantly under stretch. Significantly, when the
voids are closed by restoring the rafts to unstressed conditions, mechanical
recovery occurs, confirming the presence of concentration-dependent bond
association that - combined with force-diminished dissociation - could further
bolster network cohesion under certain stress states.

Understanding the nature of vortices in type-II superconductors has been
vital for deepening the physics of exotic superconductors and applying
superconducting materials to future electronic devices. A recent study has
shown that the LiTi2O4(111) thin film offers a unique experimental platform to
unveil the nature of the vortex along the curved Josephson junction. This study
successfully visualized individual Josephson vortices along the curved
Josephson junctions using in-situ spectroscopic scanning tunneling microscopy
on LiTi2O4 (111) epitaxial thin films. Notably, the local curvature of the
Josephson junction was discovered to control the position of Josephson
vortices. Furthermore, the numerical simulation reproduces the critical role of
the curvature of the Josephson junction. This study provides guidelines to
control Josephson vortices through geometrical ways, such as mechanical
controlling of superconducting materials and their devices.

Inspired by recent advances in the fabrication of surface superlattices, and
in particular the triangular lattice made of tin (Sn) atoms on silicon, we
study an extended Hubbard mode on a triangular lattice. The observations of
magnetism in these systems justify the inclusion of a strong on-site repulsion
and the observation of superconductivity suggests including an effective,
nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The attractive interaction mimics the
effect of strong on-site repulsion near half filling, which can be seen in
strong coupling vertex calculations such as the Eliashberg method. With this
extended Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with its geometrical
frustration, we find a rich phase diagram of various magnetic orders and
pairing functions, within the framework of self-consistent mean field theory.
We uncover the competition among magnetism and unconventional
superconductivity, and their coexistence for triplet pairings. We follow the
Fermi surface of the system as the system is doped away from half filling and
find nesting vectors and a Lifshitz transition which provide an intuitive
understanding of the phase transitions between the many orders we consider.

We investigate the performance of a Brownian thermal machine working in a
heterogeneous heat bath. The mobility of the heat bath fluctuates and it is
modelled as an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. We trap the Brownian particle with
time-dependent harmonic potential and by changing the stiffness coefficient and
bath temperatures, we perform a Stirling cycle. We numerically calculate the
average absorbed work, the average ejected heat and the performance of the heat
pump. For shorter cycle times, we find that the performance of a Brownian yet
non-Gaussian heat pump is significantly higher than the normal (Gaussian) heat
pump. We numerically find the coefficient of performance at maximum heating
power.

We investigate the nature of quantum criticality and topological phase
transitions near the critical lines obtained for the extended Kitaev chain with
next nearest neighbor hopping parameters and non-Hermitian chemical potential.
We surprisingly find multiple gap-less points, the locations of which in the
momentum space can change along the critical line unlike the Hermitian
counterpart. The interesting simultaneous occurrences of vanishing and sign
flipping behavior by real and imaginary components, respectively of the lowest
excitation is observed near the topological phase transition. Introduction of
non- Hermitian factor leads to an isolated critical point instead of a critical
line and hence, reduced number of multi-critical points as compared to the
Hermitian case. The critical exponents obtained for the multi-critical and
critical points show a very distinct behavior from the Hermitian case.

For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the
room-temperature superconductor (Tc above 400 K, 127 oC) working at ambient
pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The superconductivity
of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature (Tc), Zero-resistivity,
Critical current (Ic), Critical magnetic field (Hc), and the Meissner effect.
The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by
a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external factors such as temperature
and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu2+ substitution of Pb2+(2) ions in
the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It
concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in
distortion of the cylindrical column interface, which creates superconducting
quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat capacity results indicated that
the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The
unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be
maintained in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains
and exhibits superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.

Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have recently been discovered to
share both similarities and differences with cuprate superconductors. Notably,
the incorporation of hydrogen (H) through topotactic reduction has been found
to play a critical role in their electronic structure and, consequently, their
superconductivity. In this study, we utilized a theoretical approach combining
density-functional theory and impurity approximation to design three
characteristic multi-orbital Hubbard models representing low, moderate, and
high concentrations of topotactic-hydrogen. Consistent with experimental
findings, our simulations revealed that both low and high concentrations of
topotactic-hydrogen induce high-spin states ($S$=1) that are composed by holes
at $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals and consequently the emergent
inter-site hopping between $d_{z^2}$ to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ is unfavorable for
superconductivity. Conversely, an optimal concentration of 25\% H aligns with
the single Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band picture of superconductivity in infinite-layer
nickelates, demonstrating its beneficial effect on promoting superconducting
behavior.

The material exhibits the Ohmic metal characteristic of Pb(6s^1) above its
superconducting critical temperature, Tc, and the levitation phenomenon as
Meissner effect of a superconductor at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure below Tc. A LK-99 sample shows Tc above 126.85C (400 K). We analyze
that the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in this material is
attributed to two factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting
from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the
second being on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural
deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain along the c-axis) structure owing
to superconducting condensation at T_c. The mechanism of the room-temperature
T_c is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.

<br>
<br>
Many-body localized systems exhibit a unique characteristic of avoiding
thermalization, primarily attributed to the presence of a local disorder
potential in the Hamiltonian. In recent years there has been an interest in
simulating these systems on quantum devices. However, actual quantum devices
are subject to unavoidable decoherence that can be modeled as coupling to a
bath or continuous measurements. The quantum Zeno effect is also known to
inhibit thermalization in a quantum system, where repeated measurements
suppress transport. In this work we study the interplay of many-body
localization and the many-body quantum Zeno effect. In a prethermal regime, we
find that the signatures of many-body localization are enhanced when the system
is coupled to a bath that contains measurements of local fermion population,
subject to the appropriate choice of system and bath parameters.

In recent experiments, unprecedentedly large values for the conductivity of
electrolytes through carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been measured, possibly owing
to flow slip and a high pore surface charge density whose origin is still
unknown. By accounting for the coupling between the {quantum} CNT and the
{classical} electrolyte-filled pore capacitances, we study the case where a
gate voltage is applied to the CNT. The computed surface charge and
conductivity dependence on reservoir salt concentration and gate voltage are
intimately connected to the CNT electronic density of states. This approach
provides key insight into why metallic CNTs have larger conductivities than
semi-conducting ones.

<br>
We study quasi-bound states of two electrons that arise in two-dimensional
materials with a Mexican-hat dispersion (MHD) at an energy above its central
maximum. The width of the resonance of the local density of states created by
pairs is determined by the hybridization of atomic orbitals, due to which the
MHD is formed. The mechanism of the quasi-bound state formation is due to the
fact that effective reduced mass of electrons near the MHD top is negative. An
unusual feature of quasi-bound states is that the resonance width can vanish
and then they transform into bound states in continuum. We study in detail the
quasi-bound states for topological insulators, when the MHD is due to the
hybridization of inverted electron and hole bands. In this case, the resonance
width is extremely small at weak hybridization. The highest binding energy is
achieved for singlet quasi-bound pairs with zero angular number.

The valley Hall effect arises from valley contrasting Berry curvature and
requires inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we propose a nonlinear mechanism to
generate a valley Hall current in systems with both inversion and time-reversal
symmetry, where the linear and second-order Hall charge currents vanish along
with the linear valley Hall current. We show that a second-order valley Hall
signal emerges from the electric field correction to the Berry curvature,
provided a valley-contrasting anisotropic dispersion is engineered. We
demonstrate the nonlinear valley Hall effect in tilted massless Dirac fermions
in strained graphene and organic semiconductors. Our work opens up the
possibility of controlling the valley degree of freedom in inversion symmetric
systems via nonlinear valleytronics.

Magnetic excitations in the spin chain candidate Sr$_2$V$_3$O$_9$ have been

formed by alternating magnetic V$^{4+}$ and nonmagnetic V$^{5+}$ ions.
Incipient magnetic Bragg peaks due to weak ferromagnetic interchain couplings
emerge when approaching the magnetic transition at $T_N\sim 5.3$ K while the
excitations remain gapless within the instrumental resolution. Comparisons to
the Bethe ansatz, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, and
effective field theories confirm Sr$_2$V$_3$O$_9$ as a host of weakly coupled

Halide perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials for
photovoltaic applications. A challenge in these applications is how to prevent
the crystal structure from degradation to photovoltaically inactive phases,
which requires an understanding of the free energy landscape of these
materials. Here, we uncover the free energy landscape of two prototypical
halide perovskites, CsPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$ via atomic scale simulations using
umbrella sampling and machine-learned potentials. For CsPbBr$_3$ we find very
small free energy differences and barriers close to the transition temperatures
for both the tetragonal-to-cubic and the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition.
For MAPbI$_3$, however, the situation is more intricate. In particular the
orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition exhibits a large free energy barrier and
there are several competing tetragonal phases. Using large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations we explore the character of these transition and observe
latent heat and a discrete change in structural parameters for the
tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition in both CsPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$
indicating first-order transitions. We find that in MAPbI$_3$ the orthorhombic
phase has an extended metastability range and furthermore identify a second
metastable tetragonal phase. Finally, we compile a phase diagram for MAPbI$_3$
that includes potential metastable phases.

The commercial introduction of a novel electronic device is often preceded by
a lengthy material optimization phase devoted to the suppression of device
noise as much as possible. The emergence of novel computing architectures,
however, triggers a paradigm change in noise engineering, demonstrating that a
non-suppressed, but properly tailored noise can be harvested as a computational
resource in probabilistic computing schemes. Such strategy was recently
realized on the hardware level in memristive Hopfield neural networks
delivering fast and highly energy efficient optimization performance. Inspired
by these achievements we perform a thorough analysis of simulated memristive
Hopfield neural networks relying on realistic noise characteristics acquired on
various memristive devices. These characteristics highlight the possibility of
orders of magnitude variations in the noise level depending on the material
choice as well as on the resistance state (and the corresponding active region
volume) of the devices. Our simulations separate the effects of various device
non-idealities on the operation of the Hopfield neural network by investigating
the role of the programming accuracy, as well as the noise type and noise
amplitude of the ON and OFF states. Relying on these results we propose
optimized noise tailoring, noise annealing, and external noise injection
strategies.

Global symmetries of quantum many-body systems can be spontaneously broken.
Whenever this mechanism happens, the ground state is degenerate and one
encounters an ordered phase. In this study, our objective is to investigate
this phenomenon by examining the entanglement asymmetry of a specific region.
This quantity, which has recently been introduced in the context of $U(1)$
symmetry breaking, is extended to encompass arbitrary finite groups $G$. We
also establish a field theoretic framework in the replica theory using twist
operators. We explicitly demonstrate our construction in the ordered phase of
the Ising field theory in 1+1 dimensions, where a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is
spontaneously broken, and we employ a form factor bootstrap approach to
characterise a family of composite twist fields. Analytical predictions are
provided for the entanglement asymmetry of an interval in the Ising model as
the length of the interval becomes large. We also propose a general conjecture
relating the entanglement asymmetry and the number of degenerate vacua,
expected to be valid for a large class of states, and we prove it explicitly in
some cases.

Quantifying electron-phonon interactions for the surface states of
topological materials can provide key insights into surface-state transport,
topological superconductivity, and potentially how to manipulate the surface
state using a structural degree of freedom. We perform time-resolved x-ray
diffraction (XRD) and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements on
Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$, following the excitation of coherent A$_{1g}$
optical phonons. We extract and compare the deformation potentials coupling the
surface electronic states to local A$_{1g}$-like displacements in these two
materials using the experimentally determined atomic displacements from XRD and
electron band shifts from ARPES.We find the coupling in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ to be similar and in general in agreement with expectations from
density functional theory. We establish a methodology that quantifies the
mode-specific electron-phonon coupling experimentally, allowing detailed
comparison to theory. Our results shed light on fundamental processes in
topological insulators involving electron-phonon coupling.

The impurity incorporation in host high-spin orbit coupling materials like
platinum has shown improved charge-to-spin conversion by modifying the up-spin
and down-spin electron trajectories by bending or skewing them in opposite
directions. This enables efficient generation, manipulation, and transport of
spin currents. In this study, we irradiate the platinum with non-focus dense
plasma to incorporate the oxygen ion species. We systematically analyze the
spin Hall angle of the oxygen plasma irradiated Pt films using spin torque
ferromagnetic resonance. Our results demonstrate a 2.4 times enhancement in the
spin Hall effect after plasma treatment of Pt as compared to pristine Pt. This
improvement is attributed to the introduction of disorder and defects in the Pt
lattice, which enhances the spin-orbit coupling and leads to more efficient
charge-to-spin conversion without breaking the spin-orbit torque symmetries.
Our findings offer a new method of dense plasma-based modification of material
for the development of advanced spintronic devices based on Pt and other heavy
metals.

liquid-vapor equilibrium of Yukawa attractive fluid in the two dimensions. The
construction of tangent to the binodal of the fluid in the low-temperature
region is performed based on the Zeno-element. The dependence of Zeno-element
and Boyle parameters on interaction parameters is also studied. It is shown
that the asymptotic behavior of the Zeno-element parameters can serve as a

We introduce a practical and efficient approach for calculating the
all-electron full potential bandstructure in real space, employing a finite
element basis. As an alternative to the k-space method, the method involves the
self-consistent solution of the Kohn-Sham equation within a larger finite
system that encloses the unit-cell. It is based on the fact that the net
potential of the unit-cell converges at a certain radius point. Bandstructure
results are then obtained by performing non-self-consistent calculations in the
Brillouin zone. Numerous numerical experiments demonstrate that the obtained
valence and conduction bands are in excellent agreement with the
pseudopotential k-space method. Moreover, we successfully observe the band
bending of core electrons.

In a trapped spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate with miscible interactions, a
two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling can introduce an unconventional spatial
separation between the two components. We reveal the physical mechanism of such
a spin-orbit-coupling-induced phase separation. Detailed features of the phase
separation are identified in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. We further
analyze differences of phase separation in Rashba and anisotropic

<i>David M T Kuo</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, we investigate the charge transport properties of
semiconducting armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) and heterostructures
through their topological states (TSs), with a specific focus on the Coulomb
blockade region. Our approach employs a two-site Hubbard model that takes into
account both intra- and inter-site Coulomb interactions. Using this model, we
calculate the electron thermoelectric coefficients and tunneling currents of
serially coupled TSs (SCTSs). In the linear response regime, we analyze the
electrical conductance ($G_e$), Seebeck coefficient ($S$), and electron thermal
conductance ($\kappa_e$) of finite AGNRs. Our results reveal that at low
temperatures, the Seebeck coefficient is more sensitive to many-body spectra
than the electrical conductance. Furthermore, we observe that the optimized $S$
at high temperature is less sensitive to electron Coulomb interactions than
$G_e$ and $\kappa_e$. In the nonlinear response regime, we observe a tunneling
current with negative differential conductance through the SCTSs of finite
AGNRs. This current is generated by electron inter-site Coulomb interactions
rather than intra-site Coulomb interactions. Additionally, we observe current
rectification behavior in asymmetrical junction systems of SCTSs of AGNRs.
Notably, we also uncover the remarkable current rectification behavior of SCTSs
of 9-7-9 AGNR heterostructure in the Pauli spin blockade configuration.
Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the charge transport
properties of TSs in finite AGNRs and heterostructures. We emphasize the
importance of considering electron-electron interactions in understanding the
behavior of these materials.

The electron's kinetic energy plays a pivotal role in magnetism. While
virtual electron hopping promotes antiferromagnetism in an insulator, the real
process usually favors ferromagnetism. But in kinetically frustrated systems,
such as hole doped triangular lattice Mott insulators, real hopping has been
shown to favor antiferromagnetism. Kinetic frustration has also been predicted
to induce a new quasiparticle -- a bound state of the doped hole and a spin
flip called a spin polaron -- at intermediate magnetic fields, which could form
an unusual metallic state. However, the direct experimental observation of spin
polarons has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of spin polarons
in triangular lattice MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers by the reflective magnetic
circular dichroism measurements. We identify a spin polaron phase at lattice
filling factor between 0.8-1 and magnetic field between 2-4 T; it is separated
from the fully spin polarized phase by a metamagnetic transition. We determine
that the spin polaron is a spin-3/2 particle and its binding energy is
commensurate to the kinetic hopping energy. Our results open the door for
exploring spin polaron pseudogap metals, spin polaron pairing and other new
phenomena in triangular lattice moir\'e materials.

<h3>Novel $Ï$-type vortex in a nanoscale extreme type-II superconductor:  Induced by quantum-size effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
By numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we report a novel
$\pi$-type vortex state whose order parameter near the core undergoes an
extraordinary $\pi$-phase change for a quantum-confined extreme type-II
$s$-wave superconductor. Its supercurrent behaves as the cube of the radial
coordinate near the core, and its local density of states spectrum exhibits a
significant negative-shifted zero-bias peak. Such $\pi$-type vortex state is
induced by quantum-size effect, and can survive thermal smearing at
temperatures up to a critical value $T_\tau$. The Anderson's approximation
indicates that the $\pi$-type vortex may remain stable under sufficiently week
magnetic field in the case less deep in the type-II limit. Moreover, we find
that its appearance is governed by the sample size and $k_F\xi_0$ with $k_F$
the Fermi wave number and $\xi_0$ the zero-temperature coherence length.
Similar effects may be expected in quantum-confined ultracold superfluid Fermi
gasses, or even high-$T_c$ superconductors with proper $k_F\xi_0$ value.

Transition metal clusters have a broad spectrum of potential applications in

In this study, we optimized five core shell structures, C$_{80}$+M$_{13}$ (V,
Mn, Cr, Ni, Co), and calculated their electromagnetic properties using density
functional theory.We determined that there is electron transfer between
C$_{80}$ and the transition metal clusters near the Fermi surface, and that the
d orbitals contribute most to the magnetism of the structure.
C$_{80}$+Ni$_{13}$ was antiferromagnetic. The magnetic properties of the
clusters were significantly altered, revealing antiferromagnetism. The results
establish a theoretical starting point for tuning the electronic and magnetic
properties of 13-atom clusters embedded in fullerene cages.

The Fermi surface symmetric mass generation (SMG) is an intrinsically
interaction-driven mechanism that opens an excitation gap on the Fermi surface
without invoking symmetry-breaking or topological order. We explore this
phenomenon within a bilayer square lattice model of spin-1/2 fermions, where
the system can be tuned from a metallic Fermi liquid phase to a
strongly-interacting SMG insulator phase by an inter-layer spin-spin
interaction. The SMG insulator preserves all symmetries and has no mean-field
interpretation at the single-particle level. It is characterized by zeros in
the fermion Green's function, which encapsulate the same Fermi volume in
momentum space as the original Fermi surface, a feature mandated by the
Luttinger theorem. Utilizing both numerical and field-theoretical methods, we
provide compelling evidence for these Green's function zeros across both strong
and weak coupling regimes of the SMG phase. Our findings highlight the
robustness of the zero Fermi surface, which offers promising avenues for
experimental identification of SMG insulators through spectroscopy experiments
despite potential spectral broadening from noise or dissipation.

Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is the mostly used material for solid-state hydrogen
storage. However, their slow kinetics and highly unfavorable thermodynamics
make them unsuitable for the practical applications. The current study
describes the unusual catalytic action of a new class of catalyst, a
high-entropy alloy (HEA) of Al20Cr16Mn16Fe16Co16Ni16, on the
de/re-hydrogenation properties of MgH2. The onset desorption temperature of
MgH2 is reduced significantly from 376 {\deg}C (for pristine MgH2) to 338 degC
when it is catalyzed with a HEA-based catalyst. On the other hand, a fast
de/re-hydrogenation kinetics of MgH2 was observed during the addition of
HEA-based catalyst. It ab sorbs 6.1 wt% of hydrogen in just 2 minutes at a
temperature of 300 degC under 10 atm hydrogen pressure and desorbs ~ 5.4 wt%
within 40 minutes. At moderate temperatures and low pressure, the HEA-based
catalyst reduced desorption temperatures and improved re-hydrogenation
kinetics. Even after 25 cycles of de/re-hydrogenation, the storage capacity of
MgH2 catalyzed with the leached version of HEA degrades negligibly.

In transition-metal-oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing
interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room
temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma
of mutually strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions.
Here, we exploit the Ru doping-enhanced AHE in LSMRO epitaxial films. As the
B-site Ru doping level increases up to 20 percent, the anomalous Hall
resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from nOhmcm to uOhmcm scale. Ru
doping leads to strong competition between ferromagnetic double-exchange
interaction and antiferromagnetic super-exchange interaction. The resultant
spin frustration and spin-glass state facilitate a strong skew-scattering
process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. Our findings could
pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of
oxide-based spintronic devices.

Intermetallics are an important playground to stabilize a large variety of
physical phenomena, arising from their complex crystal structure. The ease of
their chemical tuneabilty makes them suitable platforms to realize targeted
electronic properties starting from the symmetries hidden in their unit cell.
Here, we investigate the family of the recently discovered intermetallics
MCo$_2$Al$_9$ (M: Sr, Ba) and we unveil their electronic structure for the
first time. By using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and density
functional theory calculations, we discover the existence of Dirac-like
dispersions as ubiquitous features in this family, coming from the hidden
kagome and honeycomb symmetries embedded in the unit cell. Finally, from
calculations, we expect that the spin-orbit coupling is responsible for opening
energy gaps in the electronic structure spectrum, which also affects the
majority of the observed Dirac-like states. Our study constitutes the first
experimental observation of the electronic structure of MCo$_2$Al$_9$ and
proposes these systems as hosts of Dirac-like physics with intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling. The latter effect suggests MCo$_2$Al$_9$ as a future platform for
investigating the emergence of non-trivial topology.

The quantization of conductance in the presence of non-magnetic point defects
is a consequence of topological protection and the spin-momentum locking of
helical edge states in two-dimensional topological insulators. This protection
ensures the absence of backscattering of helical edge modes in the quantum Hall
phase of the system. However, our study focuses on exploring a novel approach
to disrupt this protection. We propose that a linear arrangement of on-site
impurities can effectively lift the topological protection of edge states in
the Kane-Mele model. To investigate this phenomenon, we consider an armchair
ribbon containing a line defect spanning its width. Utilizing the tight-binding
model and non-equilibrium Green's function method, we calculate the
transmission coefficient of the system. Our results reveal a suppression of
conductance at energies near the lower edge of the bulk gap for positive
on-site potentials. To further comprehend this behavior, we perform analytical
calculations and discuss the formation of an impurity channel. This channel
arises due to the overlap of in-gap bound states, linking the bottom edge of
the ribbon to its top edge, consequently facilitating backscattering. Our
explanation is supported by the analysis of the local density of states at
sites near the position of impurities.

We study many-body localization transition in one dimensional systems in the
presence of a deterministic quasi-periodic potential. We focus on
single-particle excitations produced in highly excited many-body eigenstates
obtained through single-particle Green's function in real space. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the ratio of the typical to average value of the local
density of states of single particle excitations is performed assuming that the
correlation length $\xi$ diverges at the transition point with a power-law $\xi
\sim |h-h_c|^{-\nu}$. Both for the Aubry-Andre (AA) model and the generalized
AA model, the finite size scaling of the local density of states obeys the
single parameter scaling. A good quality scaling collapse is obtained for $\nu
\ge 1$ which satisfies the generalized Luck's criterion for quasiperiodic
systems. This analysis supports the continuous nature of the many-body
localization transition in systems with AA and generalized AA potentials.

Quantum spin liquids are tantalizing phases of frustrated quantum magnets. A
complicating factor in their realization and observation in materials is the
ubiquitous presence of other degrees of freedom, in particular lattice
distortion modes (phonons). These provide additional routes for relieving
magnetic frustration, thereby possibly destabilizing spin-liquid ground states.
In this work, we focus on triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets, where
recent numerical evidence suggests the presence of an extended U(1) Dirac spin
liquid phase which is described by compact quantum electrodynamics in 2+1
dimensions (QED$_3$), featuring gapless spinons and monopoles as gauge
excitations. Its low energy theory is believed to flow to a strongly-coupled
fixed point with conformal symmetries. Using complementary perturbation theory
and scaling arguments, we show that a symmetry-allowed coupling between
(classical) finite-wavevector lattice distortions and monopole operators of the
U(1) Dirac spin liquid generally induces a spin-Peierls instability towards a
(confining) 12-site valence-bond solid state. We support our theoretical
analysis with state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group
simulations. Away from the limit of static distortions, we demonstrate that the
phonon energy gap establishes a parameter regime where the spin liquid is
expected to be stable.

used to confirm the spinel structure of CFO and the perovskite structure of
BCTSn. The magnetic character of the resultant CFO@BCTSn NFs was determined by
SQUID magnetometry. The piezoelectricity was verified using piezo-response

outline, in accordance with SEM and TEM observations. The magnetoelectric (ME)
coefficient was measured as a function of the applied external DC magnetic
field. The maximum ME coefficient obtained for the CFO@BCTSn NFs was 346 mV

correlated. We compute, analytically -- using a general theoretical framework
-- and via Langevin dynamics simulations, the mean square displacement of a
network bead. Following a short-time super-diffusive behavior, force monopoles
yield anomalous subdiffusion with an exponent identical to that of the thermal
system. Force dipoles do not induce subdiffusion, and result in rotational
motion of the whole network -- as found for micro-swimmers -- and network
collapses beyond a critical force amplitude. The collapse persists with
increasing system size, signifying a true first-order dynamical phase
transition. We conclude that the observed identical subdiffusion exponents of
chromosomal loci in normal and ATP-depleted cells are attributed to active
force monopoles rather than force dipoles.

Discovering the nonlinear transport features in antiferromagnets is of
fundamental interest in condensed matter physics as it offers a new frontier of
the understanding deep connections between multiple degrees of freedom,
including magnetic orders, symmetries, and band geometric properties.
Antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi${_2}$Te${_4}$ has provided a
highly tunable platform for experimental explorations due to its rich magnetic
structures and striking topological band structures. Here, we experimentally
investigate the third-order nonlinear transport properties in bulk
MnBi${_2}$Te${_4}$ flakes. The measured third-harmonic longitudinal
($V_{xx}^{3{\omega}}$) and transverse ($V_{xy}^{3{\omega}}$) voltages show
intimate connection with magnetic transitions of MnBi${_2}$Te${_4}$ flakes and
their magnitudes change abruptly as MnBi${_2}$Te${_4}$ flakes go through
magnetic transitions with varying temperature and magnetic fields. In addition,
the measured $V_{xx}^{3{\omega}}$ exhibits an even-symmetric feature with
changing magnetic field direction and the $V_{xy}^{3{\omega}}$ shows an
odd-symmetric property, which are believed to be related to the quantum metric
and the emergency of non-zero Berry curvature quadrupole with broken ${PT}$
symmetry and non-degenerate band structures under external magnetic fields,
respectively. Our work shows great advances in the understanding of the
underlying interactions between multiple geometric quantities.

<br>
<br>
Color can originate from wavelength-dependence in the absorption of pigments
or the scattering of nanostructures. While synthetic colors are dominated by
the former, vivid structural colors found in nature have inspired much research
on the latter. However, many of the most vibrant colors in nature involve the
interactions of structure and pigment. Here, we demonstrate that pigment can be
exploited to efficiently create bright structural color at wavelengths outside
its absorption band. We created pigment-enhanced Bragg reflectors by
sequentially spin-coating layers of poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and polystyrene
(PS) loaded with $\beta$-carotene (BC). With only 10 double layers, we acheived
a peak reflectance over $0.8$ at 550 nm and normal incidence. A pigment-free
multilayer made of the same materials would require 25 double layers to achieve
the same reflectance. Further, pigment loading suppressed the Bragg reflector's
characteristic iridescence. Using numerical simulations, we further show that
similar pigment loadings could significantly expand the gamut of non-iridescent
colors addressable by photonic glasses.

We analyze a setup composed of a correlated quantum dot (QD) coupled to one
metallic lead and one end of topological chain hosting a Majorana zero mode
(MZM). In such a hybrid structure, a leakage of the MZM into the region of the
QD competes with the Kondo resonance appearing as a consequence of the
spin-exchange interactions between the dot and the lead. In the work, we use
the nontrivial technique called the continuous unitary transformation (CUT) to
analyze this competition. Using the CUT technique, we inspect the influence of
the coupling between the QD and the chain on effective exchange interactions
and calculate the resultant Kondo temperature.

The expected utility hypothesis is a popular concept in economics that is
useful for making decisions when the payoff is uncertain. In this paper, we
investigate the implications of a fluctuation theorem in the theory of expected
utility. In particular, we wonder whether entropy could serve as a guideline
for gambling. We prove the existence of a bound involving the certainty
equivalent which depends on the entropy produced. Then, we examine the
dependence of the certainty equivalent on the entropy by looking at specific
situations, for instance, the work extraction from a non-equilibrium initial
state.

Knitting interloops one-dimensional yarns into three-dimensional fabrics that
exhibit behaviours beyond their constitutive materials. How extensibility and
anisotropy emerge from the hierarchical organization of yarns into knitted
fabrics has long been unresolved. We sought to unravel the mechanical roles of
tensile mechanics, assembly and dynamics arising from the yarn level on fabric
nonlinearity by developing a yarn-based dynamical model. This physically
validated model captures the fundamental mechanical response of knitted
fabrics, analogous to flexible metamaterials and biological fiber networks due
to geometric nonlinearity within such hierarchical systems. We identify the
dictating factors of the mechanics of knitted fabrics, highlighting the
previously overlooked but critical effect of pre-tension. Fabric anisotropy
originates from observed yarn--yarn rearrangements during alignment dynamics
and is topology-dependent. This yarn-based model also provides design
flexibility of knitted fabrics to embed functionalities by allowing variation
in both geometric configuration and material property. Our hierarchical
approach to build up a knitted fabrics computationally modernizes an ancient
craft and represents a first step towards mechanical programmability of knitted
fabrics in wide engineering applications.

<h3>Spin Space Group Theory and Unconventional Magnons in Collinear Magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaobing Chen, Jun Ren, Jiayu Li, Yuntian Liu, Qihang Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological magnons have received substantial interest for their potential in
both fundamental research and device applications due to their exotic uncharged
yet topologically protected boundary modes. However, their understanding has
been impeded by the lack of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic
materials, of which the spin Hamiltonians are essentially determined by the
isotropic Heisenberg interaction. The corresponding magnon band structures
allows for more symmetry operations with separated spin and spatial operations,
forming spin space groups (SSGs), than the conventional magnetic space groups.
Here we developed spin space group (SSG) theory to describe collinear magnetic
configurations, identifying all the 1421 collinear SSGs and categorizing them
into four types, constructing band representations for these SSGs, and
providing a full tabulation of SSGs with exotic nodal topology. Our
representation theory perfectly explains the band degeneracies of previous
experiments and identifies new magnons beyond magnetic space groups with
topological charges, including duodecuple point, octuple nodal line and
charge-4 octuple point. With an efficient algorithm that diagnoses topological
magnons in collinear magnets, our work offers new pathways to exploring exotic
phenomena of magnonic systems, with the potential to advance the
next-generation spintronic devices.

Recently a novel surface pair-density-wave (PDW) superconducting state has
been discovered in Refs. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{122}, 165302 (2019)] and
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{101}, 054506 (2020)], which may go through a distinct
multiple phase transition (MPT) when the superconductivity fades away from bulk
to the boundary (e.g. edges and corners). Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations for the attractive tight-binding Hubbard modal in a one-dimensional
chain, we demonstrate that the surface PDW state has a non-gapless
quasiparticle spectrum, which is contrary to the conventional surface
superconducting state. Moreover, we find that the MPT is associated with a
zero-bias fast oscillating pattern in the LDOS near the surface. Our findings
provide a potential experimental clue to identify the surface PDW state.

<h3>Stark many-body localization with long-range interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12376" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12376</a>
<br>
<i>Xiang-Ping Jiang, Rui Qi, Sheng Yang, Yayun Hu, Guangwen Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
In one-dimensional (1D) disorder-free interacting systems, a sufficiently
strong linear potential can induce localization of the many-body eigenstates, a
phenomenon dubbed as Stark many-body localization (MBL). In this paper, we
investigate the fate of Stark MBL in 1D spinless fermions systems with
long-range interactions, specifically focusing on the role of interaction
strength. We obtain the Stark MBL phase diagrams by computing the mean gap
ratio and many-body inverse participation ratio at half-filling. We show that,
for short-range interactions, there is a qualitative symmetry between the
limits of weak and strong interactions. However, this symmetry is absent in the
case of long-range interactions, where the system is always Stark many-body
localized at strong interactions, regardless of the linear potential strength.
Furthermore, we study the dynamics of imbalance and entanglement with various
initial states using time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) numerical
methods. We reveal that the dynamical quantities display a strong dependence on
the initial conditions, which suggests that the Hilbert-space fragmentation
precludes thermalization. Our results demonstrate the robustness of Stark MBL
even in the presence of long-range interactions and offer an avenue to explore
MBL in disorder-free systems with long-range interactions.

<h3>Topological transition from nodal to nodeless Zeeman splitting in  altermagnets</h3>

<i>Rafael M. Fernandes, Vanuildo S. de Carvalho, Turan Birol, Rodrigo G. Pereira</i>
<br>
<br>
In an altermagnet, the symmetry that relates configurations with flipped
magnetic moments is a rotation. This makes it qualitatively different from a
ferromagnet, where no such symmetry exists, or a collinear antiferromagnet,
where this symmetry is a lattice translation. In this paper, we investigate the
impact of the crystalline environment on the magnetic and electronic properties
of an altermagnet. We find that, because each component of the magnetization
acquires its own angular dependence, the Zeeman splitting of the bands has
symmetry-protected nodal lines residing on mirror planes of the crystal. Upon
crossing the Fermi surface, these nodal lines give rise to pinch points that
behave as single or double type-II Weyl nodes. We show that an external
magnetic field perpendicular to these mirror planes can only move the nodal
lines, such that a critical field value is necessary to collapse the nodes and
make the Weyl pinch points annihilate. This unveils the topological nature of
the transition from a nodal to a nodeless Zeeman splitting of the bands. We
also classify the altermagnetic states of common crystallographic point groups
in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, revealing that a broad family of
magnetic orthorhombic perovskites can realize altermagnetism.

<h3>Structural and double magnetic transitions in the frustrated  spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ capped-kaogme antiferromagnet  (RbCl)Cu$_{5}$P$_{2}$O$_{10}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The structural and magnetic properties of the geometrically frustrtaed
spin-$1/2$ capped-kagome antiferromagnet (RbCl)Cu$_{5}$P$_{2}$O$_{10}$ are
investigated via temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat
capacity, and $^{31}$P NMR experiments on a polycrystalline sample. It
undergoes a structural transition at around $T_{\rm t} \simeq 310$ K from high
temperature trigonal ($P\bar{3}m1$) to a low temperature monoclinic ($C2/c$)
unit cell, where the low temperature structure features the capped-kagome
geometry of Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Interestingly, it shows the onset of two successive
magnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 20$ K and $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 7$ K.
The shape of $^{31}$P NMR spectra unfold the possible nature of the transitions
below $T_{\rm N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$ to be incommensurate and commensurate
antiferromagnetic type, respectively. A large value of Curie-Weiss temperature
as compared to $T_{\rm N1}$ sets the frustration parameter $f \simeq 8$,
ensuring strong magnetic frustration in the compound. From the $^{31}$P NMR
spin-lattice relaxation rate, the leading antiferromagnetic exchange coupling
is estimated to be $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 117$ K. This unusual double magnetic
transitions make this compound beguiling for further investigations.

Motivated by advances in hydrogen-rich superconductors in the past decades,
we conducted variable-composition structural searches in Mo-H binary system at
high pressure. A new composition-pressure phase diagram of thermodynamically
stable structures has been derived. Besides all previously discovered
superconducting molybdenum hydrides, we also identified series of
thermodynamically metastable superconducting structures, including
I4/mmm-Mo$_3$H$_{14}$, I4cm-MoH$_9$, P4/nmm-MoH$_{10}$ and P42$_1$2-MoH$_{10}$,
with the superconducting transition temperatures from 55 to 126 K at 300 GPa.
In these superconducting molybdenum hydrides, vibrations of the Mo-atoms
contributes significantly to the electron-phonon coupling and the
superconducting transition temperature, in complementary to the contributions
by the vibrations of the H-atoms. Our works highlight the importance of
compounds with non-integer composition ratio and metastable states in material
searches, for example the potential high temperature superconductors.

<h3>Macroscopic Stochastic Thermodynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Gianmaria Falasco, Massimiliano Esposito</i>
<br>
<br>
Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic
thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, we identify the scaling
conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic
dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. We then use
large deviations theory to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this
deterministic behavior, which we show preserves the fluctuation theorem. For
many systems (e.g. chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, Potts
models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches
(obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics) which,
if used, are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of
Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at
equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum, the free
energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasi-potential (or
self-information) which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics.
Remarkably, thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and
escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential, thus constraining
the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A
coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is
also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, we derive a
nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics.
Finally, we coarse grain the macroscopic stochastic dynamics into a Markov jump
process describing transitions among deterministic attractors and formulate the
stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it.

<h3>Statistics of matrix elements of local operators in integrable models</h3>

We study the statistics of matrix elements of local operators in the basis of
energy eigenstates in a paradigmatic integrable many-particle quantum theory,
the Lieb-Liniger model of bosons with repulsive delta-function interaction.
Using methods of quantum integrability we determine the scaling of matrix
elements with system size. As a consequence of the extensive number of
conservation laws the structure of matrix elements is fundamentally different
from, and much more intricate than, the predictions of the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis for generic models. We uncover an interesting
connection between this structure for local operators in interacting integrable
models, and the one for local operators that are not local with respect to the
elementary excitations in free theories. We find that typical off-diagonal
matrix elements $\langle\boldsymbol{\mu}|O|\boldsymbol{\lambda}\rangle$ in the
same macro-state scale as $\exp(-c^{
O}L\ln(L)-LM^{O}_{\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\lambda}})$ where the
probability distribution function for
$M^{O}_{\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\lambda}}$ are well described by Fr\'echet
distributions and $c^{O}$ depends only on macro-state information. In contrast,
typical off-diagonal matrix elements between two different macro-states scale
as $\exp(-d^{ O}L^2)$, where $d^{O}$ depends only on macro-state information.
Diagonal matrix elements depend only on macro-state information up to
finite-size corrections.

We demonstrate an exceptional ability of a high-polarisation 3D ferroelectric
liquid to form freely-suspended fluid fibres at room temperature. Unlike fluid
threads in modulated smectics and columnar phases, where translational order is
a prerequisite for forming liquid fibres, recently discovered ferroelectric
nematic forms fibres with solely orientational molecular order. Additional
stabilisation mechanisms based on the polar nature of the mesophase are
required for this. We propose a model for such a mechanism and show that these
fibres demonstrate an exceptional non-linear optical response and exhibit
electric field-driven instabilities.

<br>
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD) have been used to study transition metal impurities on K and Na films.
The multiplet structure of the XAS spectra indicates that Fe, Co, and Ni have
localized atomic ground states with predominantly d7, d8, and d9 character,
respectively. XMCD shows that the localized impurity states possess large,
atomiclike, magnetic orbital moments that are progressively quenched as
clusters are formed. Ni impurities on Na films are found to be nonmagnetic,
with a strongly increased d10 character of the impurity state. The results show
that the high magnetic moments of transition metals in alkali hosts originate
from electron localization.

A construction of a quasi-random potential for cold atoms using dark states
emerging in $\Lambda$ {level configuration} is proposed. Speckle laser fields
are used as a source of randomness.
Anderson localisation in such potentials is studied and compared with the
known results for the speckle potential itself. It is found out that the
localisation length is greatly decreased due to the non-linear fashion in which
dark-state potential is obtained. In effect, random dark state potentials
resemble those occurring in random Kronig-Penney-type Hamiltonians.

<br>
<br>
Amorphous polymers are considered promising materials for separations due to
their excellent transport properties and low fabrication costs. The separation
performance of a membrane material is characterized by its permeability
(overall throughput of components), and selectivity (efficiency of separation).
Both permeability and selectivity are controlled by the diffusion of different
penetrants through the matrix, which is strongly influenced by the distribution
and morphology of the free volume elements (FVEs). FVEs are void spaces in the
polymer matrix that result from the inefficient packing of bulky and rigid
groups on the polymer backbone. Thus, FVEs dictate the efficiency of membrane
polymers, and it is imperative to understand how processing conditions such as
high pressure influence their structure. In this paper, we apply uniaxial
tensile deformation on three polymers, namely polystyrene (PS),
polymethylpentene (PMP), and HAB-6FDA thermally rearranged polymer (TRP), at
varying temperatures and strain rates. We calculate the stress strain curve,
tensile modulus, and free volume element evolution at these conditions. We find
that PMP and PS with low and moderate glass transition temperature,
respectively, exhibit the most change in mechanical properties as a function of
strain rate and temperature. The properties of TRP, however, do not vary as
much. We also find that FVEs become larger with deformation, and the extent of
this change is in line with the overall change of mechanical properties of the
material.

The electrified solid-liquid interface plays an essential role in many
renewable energy-related applications, including hydrogen production and
utilization. Limitations in computational modelling of the electrified
solid-liquid interface have held back the understanding of its properties at
the atomic-scale level. In this study, we applied the grand canonical density
functional theory (GC-DFT) combined with a hybrid implicit/explicit solvation
model to reinvestigate the widely studied electrified platinum-water interface
affordably. This GC-DFT method was validated by successfully reproducing the
experimental potential of zero charge (PZC) of the Pt(111)-water interface. The
calculated capacitances of the Pt(111)-water interface over the applied bias
potential closely match the experimental and previous theoretical data from
expensive ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. The structural analysis of
the interface models reveals that the applied bias potential can significantly
affect the Pt(111)-water atomic interface configurations. The orientation of
the water molecules next to the Pt(111) surface is vital for correctly
describing the PZC and capacitance. Additionally, our GC-DFT results confirm
that the absorption of the hydrogen atom under applied bias potential can
significantly affect the electrified interfacial properties. The developed
affordable GC-DFT approach, therefore, offers an efficient and accurate means
to enhance the understanding of electrified solid-liquid interfaces.

Photoemission orbital tomography (POT) from photoelectron momentum maps
(PMMs) has enabled detailed analysis of the shape and energy of molecular
orbitals in the adsorbed state. This study proposes a new POT method based on
the PhaseLift. Molecular orbitals, including three-dimensional phases, can be
identified from a single PMM by actively providing atomic positions and basis.
Moreover, our method is robust to noise and can perfectly discriminate
adsorption-induced molecular deformations with an accuracy of 0.05 [angstrom].
Our new method enables simultaneous analysis of the three-dimensional shapes of
molecules and molecular orbitals and thus paves the way for advanced
quantum-mechanical interpretation of adsorption-induced electronic state
changes and photo-excited inter-molecular interactions.

Topological phases are greatly enriched by including non-Hermiticity. While
most works focus on the topology of the eigenvalues and eigenstates, how
topologically nontrivial non-Hermitian systems behave in dynamics has only
drawn limited attention. Here, we consider a breathing honeycomb lattice known
to emulate the quantum spin Hall effect and exhibits higher-order corner modes.
We find that non-reciprocal intracell couplings introduce gain in one
pseudo-spin subspace while loss with the same magnitude in the other. In
addition, non-reciprocal intracell couplings can also suppress the spin mixture
of the edge modes at the boundaries and delocalize the higher-order corner
mode. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian topological phases
and bring in the spin degree of freedom in manipulating the dynamics in
non-Hermitian systems.

The algebraic tools used to study topological phases of matter are not
clearly suited to studying processes in which the bulk energy gap closes, such
as phase transitions. We describe an elementary two edge thought experiment
which reveals the effect of an anyon condensation phase transition on the
robust edge properties of a sample, bypassing a limitation of the algebraic
description. In particular, the two edge construction allows some edge degrees
of freedom to be tracked through the transition, despite the bulk gap closing.
The two edge model demonstrates that bulk anyon condensation induces symmetry
breaking in the edge model. Further, the construction recovers the expected
result that the number of chiral current carrying modes at the edge cannot
change through anyon condensation. We illustrate the construction through
detailed analysis of anyon condensation transitions in an achiral phase, the
toric code, and in chiral phases, the Kitaev spin liquids.

Liquid droplets hanging from solid surfaces are commonplace, but their
physics is complex. Examples include dew or raindrops hanging onto wires or
droplets accumulating onto a cover placed over warm food or windshields. In
these scenarios, determining the force of detachment is crucial to rationally
design technologies. Despite much research, a quantitative theoretical
framework for detachment force remains elusive. In response, we interrogated
the elemental droplet surface system via comprehensive laboratory and
computational experiments. The results reveal that the Young Laplace equation
can be utilized to accurately predict the droplet detachment force. When
challenged against experiments with liquids of varying properties and droplet
sizes, detaching from smooth and microtextured surfaces of wetting and non
wetting chemical makeups, the predictions were in an excellent quantitative
agreement. This study advances the current understanding of droplet physics and
will contribute to the rational development of technologies.

We study the relation between the quantum geometry of wave functions and the
Landau level (LL) spectrum of two-band Hamiltonians with a quadratic band
crossing point (QBCP) in two-dimensions. By investigating the influence of
interband coupling parameters on the wave function geometry of general QBCPs,
we demonstrate that the interband coupling parameters can be entirely
determined by the projected elliptic image of the wave functions on the Bloch
sphere, which can be characterized by three parameters, i.e., the major $d_1$
and minor $d_2$ diameters of the ellipse, and one angular parameter $\phi$
describing the orientation of the ellipse. These parameters govern the
geometric properties of the system such as the Berry phase and modified LL
spectra. Explicitly, by comparing the LL spectra of two quadratic band models
with and without interband couplings, we show that the product of $d_1$ and
$d_2$ determines the constant shift in LL energy while their ratio governs the
initial LL energies near a QBCP. Also, by examining the influence of the
rotation and time-reversal symmetries on the wave function geometry, we
construct a minimal continuum model which exhibits various wave function
geometries. We calculate the LL spectra of this model and discuss how interband
couplings give LL structure for dispersive bands as well as nearly flat bands.

The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of
bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value
of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via
numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We
study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a
recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model
shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to
O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise
for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also
report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al.
and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.

<br>
<br>
We investigate an energy flow in an extended Holstein model describing
electron systems coupled to hot-phonons and heat-bath phonons. To analyze the
relaxation process after the photo-excitation of electrons, we employ the
nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We find the backward energy
flow during the relaxation, where the direction of energy transfer between
electrons and hot-phonons is reversed. To clarify the microscopic mechanism of
the backward energy flow, we introduce the approximated energy flows, which are
calculated with the gradient and quasiparticle approximations and are related
to the nonequilibrium distribution functions. We compare these approximated
energy flows with the full energy flows calculated from the nonequilibrium
DMFT. We find that, in the weak electron-hot-phonon coupling regime, the full
and approximated energy flows are almost the same, meaning that the relaxation
dynamics can be correctly understood in terms of the nonequilibrium
distribution functions. As the strength of the electron-hot-phonon coupling
increases, the approximated energy flow fails to qualitatively reproduce the
full energy flow. This indicates that the microscopic origin of the energy flow
cannot be solely explained by the nonequilibrium distribution functions. By
comparing the energy flows with different levels of approximation, we reveal
the role of the gradient and quasiparticle approximations.

The quest for quantum spin liquids has garnered significant attention due to
their rich physics and disruptive prospects in quantum communication and
computation. Spin-orbit coupling, electron correlation, and structural
distortion play critical roles in the candidate materials that eventually order
antiferromagnetically at low temperatures. We introduce quantum electron
confinement to the existing complexity and explore the interplay between
Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions in ultrathin \ce{Na2IrO3} layers using
first-principles calculations. The zigzag antiferromagnetic state in the
monolayer is reinforced and pushed further away from the Kitaev spin liquid
state due to the increased strength of Heisenberg and off-diagonal exchange
interactions. In contrast, the carrier-doped flakes undergo a Mott
insulator-to-metal transition accompanied by an antiferromagnetic to
ferromagnetic transition. These findings present exciting prospects for
comprehending magnetism in a novel two-dimensional framework of non-van der
Waals correlated oxide flakes.

<br>
<br>
Recently a highly ordered Moir\'e dislocation lattice was identified at the
interface between a \ce{SrTiO3} (STO) thin film and the
(LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrate. A fundamental
understanding of the local ionic and electronic structure around the
dislocation cores is crucial to further engineer the properties of these
complex multifunctional heterostructures. Here we combine experimental
characterization via analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy with
results of molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations to
gain insights into the structure and defect chemistry of these dislocation
arrays. Our results show that these dislocations lead to undercoordinated Ta/Al
cations at the dislocation core, where oxygen vacancies can easily be formed,
further facilitated by the presence of cation vacancies. The reduced Ti$^{3+}$
observed experimentally at the dislocations by electron energy-loss
spectroscopy are a consequence of both the structure of the dislocation itself,
as well as of the electron-doping due to oxygen vacancy formation. Finally, the
experimentally observed Ti diffusion into LSAT around the dislocation core
occurs only together with cation-vacancy formation in LSAT or Ta diffusion into
STO.

Developing behavioral policies designed to efficiently solve target-search
problems is a crucial issue both in nature and in the nanotechnology of the
21st century. Here, we characterize the target-search strategies of simple
microswimmers in a homogeneous environment containing sparse targets of unknown
positions. The microswimmers are capable of controlling their dynamics by
switching between Brownian motion and an active Brownian particle and by
selecting the time duration of each of the two phases. The specific conduct of
a single microswimmer depends on an internal decision-making process determined
by a simple neural network associated with the agent itself. Starting from a
population of individuals with random behavior, we exploit the genetic
algorithm NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies to show how an evolutionary
pressure based on the target-search performances of single individuals helps to
find the optimal duration of the two different phases. Our findings reveal that
the optimal policy strongly depends on the magnitude of the particle's
self-propulsion during the active phase and that a broad spectrum of network
topology solutions exists, differing in the number of connections and hidden
nodes.

<h3>A Unified Perspective on Sampling Algorithms for Rare Trajectories of  Discrete Markov Processes</h3>

<br>

This article analyzes and compares two general techniques of rare event
simulation for generating paths of Markov processes over fixed time horizons:
backtracking and exponential tilting. These two methods allow to compute the
probability that the process ends within a rare region, which is unlikely to be
attained. Backtracking consists in reversing the time of the process: the path
is obtained backwards, from the terminal point until the initial one. The
terminal point is generated from an appropriately chosen distribution that
covers well the arrival region. Exponential tilting is a general technique for
obtaining an alternative sampling probability measure, under which the process
is likely to hit the rare region at terminal time. We show that both methods
belong to the same class of importance sampling procedures, by providing the
common mathematical framework of these two conceptually different methods of
sampling rare trajectories. Besides this analytical comparison, we compare the
two methods numerically, by means of a simple random walk and a process with
meta-stable states. The numerical analysis shows that both methods possess
distinct areas of application where they exhibit greater efficiency. Detailed
algorithms of the proposed simulation methods are provided.

The intermetallic LaFeSi and the derived superconducting compounds LaFeSiH
and LaFeSiO have been investigated by polarized Raman spectroscopy. The
frequency and symmetry of the Raman phonons modes are well-reproduced by
ab-initio calculations. The ionic character of the spacer in this series of
compounds and its coupling with the FeSi layers as compared to As-based
compounds are discussed. Already at room temperature, Fano-shape modes are
reported in the A1g channel while an intriguing doubling of the Fe-based B1g
phonon is measured in LaFeSiH. Origins of these observations are discussed
based on electron diffraction data and the different scenarios for the origin
of such splitting are explored. Furthermore, there is no signature of a
structural transition nor long range magnetic ordering in LaFeSiH down to 9 K.

<h3>Fate of localization in coupled free chain and disordered chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12631" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12631</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
It has been widely believed that almost all states in one-dimensional (1d)
disordered systems with short-range hopping and uncorrelated random potential
are localized. Here, we consider the fate of these localized states by coupling
between a disordered chain (with localized states) and a free chain (with
extended states), showing that states in the overlapped and un-overlapped
regimes exhibit totally different localization behaviors, which is not a phase
transition process. In particular, while states in the overlapped regime are
localized by resonant coupling, in the un-overlapped regime of the free chain,
significant suppression of the localization with a prefactor of $\xi^{-1}
\propto t_v^4/\Delta^4$ appeared, where $t_v$ is the inter-chain coupling
strength and $\Delta$ is the energy shift between them. This system may exhibit
localization lengths that are comparable with the system size even when the
potential in the disordered chain is strong. We confirm these results using the
transfer matrix method and sparse matrix method for systems $L \sim 10^6 -
10^9$. These findings extend our understanding of localization in
low-dimensional disordered systems and provide a concrete example, which may
call for much more advanced numerical methods in high-dimensional models.

We carry out dynamical microwave transport experiments in aperiodic Vogel
spiral arrays of cylinders with high dielectric permittivity. We experimentally
disclose the electromagnetic modal structure of these structures in real space
showing that they simultaneously support long-lived modes with Gaussian,
exponential, and power law spatial decay. This unique modal structure, which
cannot be found in traditional periodic or disordered photonic materials, is
shown to be at the origin of strong localization in Vogel spirals that survives
even in three dimensions. Altogether our results unveil the manifestations of
the rich, unprecedented, spatial structure of electromagnetic modes supported
by aperiodic photonic systems in wave transport and localization.

<h3>Vibrational Entropic Stabilization of Layered Chalcogenides: From  Ordered Vacancy Compounds to 2D Layers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite the rapid pace of computationally and experimentally discovering new
two-dimensional layered materials, a general criteria for a given compound to
prefer a layered structure over a non-layered one remains unclear. Articulating
such criteria would allow one to identify materials at the verge of an
inter-dimensional structural phase transition between a 2D layered phase and 3D
bulk one, with potential applications in phase change memory devices. Here we
identify a general stabilization effect driven by vibrational entropy that can
favor 2D layered structures over 3D bulk structures at higher temperatures,
which can manifest in ordered vacancy compounds where phase competition is
tight. We demonstrate this vibrational-entropy stabilization effect for three
prototypical ordered vacancy chalcogenides, ZnIn2S4 and In2S3, and Cu3VSe4,
either by vacancy rearrangement or by cleaving through existing vacancies. The
relative vibrational entropy advantage of the 2D layered phase originates
mainly from softened out-of-plane dilation phonon modes.

<br>
<br>
Understanding the profound impact of correlation effects and crystal
imperfections is essential for an accurate description of solids. Here we study
the role of correlation, disorder, and multi-magnon processes in THz magnons.
Our findings reveal that a significant part of the electron self-energy, which
goes beyond the adiabatic local spin density approximation, arises from the
interaction between electrons and a virtual magnon gas. This interaction leads
to a substantial modification of the exchange splitting and a renormalization
of magnon energies, in agreement with the experimental data. We establish a
quantitative hierarchy of magnon relaxation processes based on first
principles.

We investigate nanoscale domain engineering via epitaxial coupling in a set
of SrRuO$_3$/PbTiO$_3$/SrRuO$_3$ heterostructures epitaxially grown on
(110)$_o$-oriented DyScO$_3$ substrates. The SrRuO$_3$ layer thickness is kept
at 55 unit cells, whereas the PbTiO$_3$ layer is grown to thicknesses of 23, 45
and 90 unit cells. Through a combination of atomic force microscopy, x-ray
diffraction and high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
studies, we find that above a certain critical thickness of the ferroelectric
layer, the large structural distortions associated with the ferroelastic
domains propagate through the top SrRuO$_3$ layer, locally modifying the
orientation of the orthorhombic SrRuO$_3$ and creating a modulated structure
that extends beyond the ferroelectric layer boundaries.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that the spin wave Cherenkov effect can be used to design the
unidirectional spin wave emitter with tunable frequency and switchable
direction of emission. In our numerical studies, we propose to use a pair of
traveling profiles of the magnetic field which generate the spin waves, for
sufficiently large velocity of their motion. In the considered system, the spin
waves of shorter (longer) wavelengths are induced at the front (back) of the
moving profiles and interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the
velocity of the profiles. Moreover, we showed that the spin waves can be
confined between the pair of traveling profiles of the magnetic field. This
work opens the perspectives for the experimental studies in hybrid
magnonic-superconducting systems where the magnetic vortices in a
superconductor can be used as moving sources of the magnetic field driving the
spin waves in the ferromagnetic subsystem.

<br>
<br>
We perform micro-photoluminescence and Raman experiments to examine the
impact of biaxial tensile strain on the optical properties of WS2 monolayers. A
strong shift on the order of -130 meV per % of strain is observed in the
neutral exciton emission at room temperature. Under near-resonant excitation we
measure a monotonic decrease in the circular polarization degree under applied
strain. We experimentally separate the effect of the strain-induced energy
detuning and evaluate the pure effect coming from biaxial strain. The analysis
shows that the suppression of the circular polarization degree under biaxial
strain is related to an interplay of energy and polarization relaxation
channels as well as to variations in the exciton oscillator strength affecting
the long-range exchange interaction.

<h3>Charge transfer-induced Lifshitz transition and magnetic symmetry  breaking in ultrathin CrSBr crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ultrathin CrSBr flakes are exfoliated \emph{in situ} on Au(111) and Ag(111)
and their electronic structure is studied by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. The thin flakes' electronic properties are drastically different
from those of the bulk material and also substrate-dependent. For both
substrates, a strong charge transfer to the flakes is observed, partly
populating the conduction band and giving rise to a highly anisotropic Fermi
contour with an Ohmic contact to the substrate. The fundamental CrSBr band gap
is strongly renormalized compared to the bulk. The charge transfer to the CrSBr
flake is substantially larger for Ag(111) than for Au(111), but a rigid energy
shift of the chemical potential is insufficient to describe the observed band
structure modifications. In particular, the Fermi contour shows a Lifshitz
transition, the fundamental band gap undergoes a transition from direct on
Au(111) to indirect on Ag(111) and a doping-induced symmetry breaking between
the intra-layer Cr magnetic moments further modifies the band structure.
Electronic structure calculations can account for non-rigid Lifshitz-type band
structure changes in thin CrSBr as a function of doping and strain. In contrast
to undoped bulk band structure calculations that require self-consistent $GW$
theory, the doped thin film properties are well-approximated by density
functional theory if local Coulomb interactions are taken into account on the
mean-field level and the charge transfer is considered.

<h3>Exploring the equilibrium and dynamic phase transition properties of  Ising ferromagnet on a decorated triangular lattice</h3>

<i>Yusuf YÃ¼ksel</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the equilibrium and dynamic phase transition properties of
two-dimensional Ising model on a decorated triangular lattice under the
influence of a time-dependent magnetic field composed of a periodic square wave
part plus a time independent bias term. Using Monte Carlo simulations with
standard Metropolis algorithm, we determine the equilibrium critical behavior
in zero field. At a fixed temperature corresponding to the multidroplet regime,
we locate the relaxation time and the dynamic critical half-period at which a
dynamic phase transition takes place between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic
states. Benefiting from finite-size scaling theory, we estimate the dynamic
critical exponent ratios for the dynamic order parameter and its scaled
variance, respectively. The response function of the average energy is found to
follow a logarithmic scaling as a function of lattice size. At the critical
half-period and in the vicinity of small bias field regime, average of the
dynamic order parameter obeys a scaling relation with a dynamic scaling
exponent which is very close to the equilibrium critical isotherm value.
Finally, in the slow critical dynamics regime, investigation of metamagnetic
fluctuations in the presence of bias field revels a symmetric double-peak
behavior for the scaled variance contours of dynamic order parameter and
average energy. Our results strongly resemble those previously reported for
kinetic Ising models.

Magnon gap excitations selectively coupled to phonon modes have been studied
in FePSe$_3$ layered antiferromagnet with magneto-Raman scattering experiments
performed at different temperatures. The bare magnon excitation in this
material has been found to be split (by $\approx~1.2$ cm$^{-1}$) into two
components each being selectively coupled to one of the two degenerated, nearby
phonon modes. Lifting the degeneracy of the fundamental magnon mode points out
toward the biaxial character of the FePS$_3$ antiferromagnet, with an
additional in-plane anisotropy complementing much stronger, out-of-plane
anisotropy. Moreover, the tunability, with temperature, of the phonon- versus
the magnon-like character of the observed coupled modes has been demonstrated.

In this study, we investigate dynamic light scattering (DLS) from both
randomly diffusing silica particles and acousto-responsive microgels in aqueous
dispersions under ultrasonic vibration. Employing high-frequency ultrasound
(US) with low amplitude ensures that the polymers remain intact without damage.
We derive theoretical expressions for the homodyne autocorrelation function,
incorporating the US term alongside the diffusion term. Subsequently, we
successfully combine US with a conventional DLS system to experimentally
characterize compact silica particles and microgels under the influence of US.
Our model allows us to extract essential parameters, including particle size,
frequency, and amplitude of particle vibration, based on the correlation
function of the scattered light intensity. The studies involving non-responsive
silica particles demonstrate that US does not disrupt size determination,
establishing them as suitable reference systems. Microgels show the same
swelling/shrinking behavior as that induced by temperature, but with
significantly faster kinetics. The findings of this study have potential
applications in various industrial and biomedical fields that benefit from the
characterization of macromolecules subjected to US.

We study the statistics of random functionals
$\mathcal{Z}=\int_{0}^{\mathcal{T}}[x(t)]^{\gamma-2}dt$, where $x(t)$ is the
trajectory of a one-dimensional Brownian motion with diffusion constant $D$
under the effect of a logarithmic potential $V(x)=V_0\ln(x)$. The trajectory
starts from a point $x_0$ inside an interval entirely contained in the positive
real axis, and the motion is evolved up to the first-exit time $\mathcal{T}$
from the interval. We compute the exact PDF of $\mathcal{Z}$ for $\gamma=0$,
and its Laplace transform for $\gamma\neq0$, which can be inverted for
particular combinations of $\gamma$ and $V_0$. Then we consider the dynamics in
$(0,\infty)$ up to the first-passage time to the origin, and obtain the exact
distribution for $\gamma>0$ and $V_0>-D$. By using a mapping between Brownian
motion in logarithmic potentials and heterogeneous diffusion, we extend this
result to functionals measured over trajectories generated by
$\dot{x}(t)=\sqrt{2D}[x(t)]^{\theta}\eta(t)$, where $\theta<1$ and $\eta(t)$ is
a Gaussian white noise. We also emphasize how the different interpretations
that can be given to the Langevin equation affect the results. Our findings are
illustrated by numerical simulations, with good agreement between data and
theory.

Kite growth is a process that utilizes laminar gas flow in chemical vapor
deposition to grow long, well-aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are suitable
for electronic application. This process uses metal nanoparticles as catalytic
seeds for CNT growth. However, these nanoparticles remain as impurities in the
grown CNT. In this study, nanodiamonds (NDs) with negligible catalytic activity
were utilized as nonmetallic seeds instead of metal catalysts because they are
stable at high temperatures and facilitate the growth of low-defect CNTs
without residual metal impurities. Results demonstrate the successful growth of
over 100-$\mu$m-long CNTs by carefully controlling the growth conditions.
Secondary electron (SE) yield and atomic force microscopy analyses revealed
that most of the aligned CNTs were grown from ND, and not the metal impurities,
via the tip-growth mode. Structural characterizations revealed the high
crystallinity of CNTs, with relatively small diameters. This study presents the
first successful use of nonmetallic seeds for kite growth and provides a
convincing alternative for starting materials to prepare long, aligned CNTs
without metal impurities. The findings of this study pave the way for more
convenient fabrication of aligned CNT-based devices, potentially simplifying
the production process by avoiding the need for the removal of metal
impurities.

NiPS3 is a Van der Waals antiferromagnet that has been found to display
spin-charge and spin-phonon coupling in its antiferromagnetically ordered state
below TN = 155 K. Here, we study high-quality crystals of site-diluted
Ni1-xZnxPS3 (0 < x < 0.2) using temperature-dependent specific heat and Raman
spectroscopy probes. The site dilution suppresses the antiferromagnetic
ordering in accordance with the mean-field prediction. In NiPS3, we show that
the phonon mode P2 (176 cm-1) associated with Ni vibrations show a distinct
asymmetry due to the Fano resonance, which persists only in the paramagnetic
phase, disappearing below T_N = 155 K. This was further supported by
temperature-dependent Raman data on an 8% Zn-doped crystal (T_N = 135 K) where
Fano resonance similarly van in the magnetically ordered phase. This is
contrary to the behaviour of the Raman mode P9 (570 cm-1), which shows a Fano
resonance at low temperatures below T_N due to its coupling with the two-magnon
continuum. We show that the Fano resonance of P2 arises from its coupling with
an electronic continuum that weakens considerably upon cooling to low
temperatures. In the doped crystals, the Fano coupling is found to enhance with
Zn-doping. These observations suggest the presence of strong electron-phonon
coupling in the paramagnetic phase of NiPS3 due to charge density fluctuations
associated with the negative charge transfer state of Ni.

Halide double perovskite semiconductors such as Cs2AgBiBr6 are widely
investigated as a more stable, less toxic alternative to lead-halide
perovskites in light conversion applications including photovoltaics and
photoredox catalysis. However, the relatively large and indirect bandgap of
Cs2AgBiBr6 limits efficient sunlight absorption. Here, we show that controlled
replacement of Bi3+ with Fe3+ via mechanochemical synthesis results in a
remarkable tunable absorption onset between 2.1 and ~1 eV. Our first-principles
density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that this bandgap
reduction originates primarily from a lowering of the conduction band upon
introduction of Fe3+. Furthermore, we find that the tunability of the
conduction band energy is reflected in the photoredox activity of these
semiconductors. Finally, our DFT calculations predict a direct bandgap when
>50% of Bi3+ is replaced with Fe3+. Our findings open new avenues for enhancing
the sunlight absorption of double perovskite semiconductors and for harnessing
their full potential in sustainable energy applications.

We show how residual stresses emerge in a visco-elastic material as a
signature of its past flow history, through an interplay between flow-modified
microscopic relaxation and macroscopic features of the flow. Long-lasting
temporal-history dependence of the microscopic dynamics and nonlinear rheology
are incorporated through the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition
(MCT). The theory's integral constitutive equation (ICE) is coupled to
continuum mechanics in a finite-element method (FEM) scheme that tracks the
flow history through the Finger tensor. The method is suitable for a
calculation of residual stresses from a "first-principles" starting point
following well-understood approximations. As an example, we calculate within a
schematic version of MCT the stress-induced optical birefringence pattern of an
amorphous solid cast into the shape of a slab with a cylindrical obstacle and
demonstrate how FEM-MCT can predict the dependence of material properties on
the material's processing history.

Herein, NiO nanosheets supported with Ag single atoms are synthesized for
photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to achieve 1065 mmol g-1 h-1 of CO production
rate under 1 sun irradiation, revealing the unparalleled weak sunlight driven
reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) activity. This performance is
attributed to the coupling effect of Ag-O-Ni sites to enhance the hydrogenation
of CO2 and weaken the CO adsorption, resulting in 1434 mmol g-1 h-1 of CO yield
at 300 degree, surpassing any low-temperature RWGS performances ever reported.
Building on this, we integrated the 2D Ni1Ag0.02O1 supported photothermal RWGS
with commercial photovoltaic electrolytic water splitting, leading to the
realization of 103 m2 scale artificial photosynthesis system with a daily CO
yield of 18.70 m3, a photochemical energy conversion efficiency of >16%, over
90% H2 ultilazation efficiency, outperforming other types of artificial
photosynthesis. The results of this research chart a promising course for
designing practical, natural sunlight-driven artificial photosynthesis systems
and highly efficient platinum-free CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. This work is a
significant step towards harnessing solar energy more efficiently and
sustainably, opening exciting possibilities for future research and development

<h3>The Spin Point Groups and their Representations</h3>

The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space
and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case
where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The
magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong
spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the
intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were
introduced in the 1960's and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we
complete the theory of spin point groups by presenting an account of these
groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the
so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering 598 groups) have co-irreps
corresponding exactly to the (co-)irreps of regular or black and white groups
and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total
spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group,
has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We
provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new
forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit
the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a
number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.

<h3>Dimensionless Numbers Reveal Distinct Regimes in the Structure and  Dynamics of Pedestrian Crowds</h3>

<br>
<br>
In fluid mechanics, dimensionless numbers like the Reynolds number help
classify flows. We argue that such a classification is also relevant for crowd
flows by putting forward the dimensionless Intrusion and Avoidance
numbers.Using an extensive dataset, we show that these delineate regimes that
are characterized by distinct structural signatures, best probed in terms of
distances at low Avoidance number and times-to-collision at low Intrusion
number.These findings prompt a perturbative expansion of the agent-based
dynamics; the generic models thus obtained perform well in (and only in) the
regime in which they were derived.

<h3>Non-equilibrium memory effects: granular fluids and beyond</h3>

<br>
In this perspective paper, we look into memory effects in out-of-equilibrium
systems. To be concrete, we exemplify memory effects with the paradigmatic case
of granular fluids, although extensions to other contexts such as molecular
fluids with non-linear drag are also considered. The focus is put on two
archetypal memory effects: the Kovacs and Mpemba effects. In brief, the first
is related to imperfectly reaching a steady state -- either equilibrium or
non-equilibrium, whereas the second is related to reaching a steady state
faster despite starting further. Connections to optimal control theory thus
naturally emerge and are briefly discussed.

<h3>Coherent Dynamics of Charge Carriers in Î³-InSe Revealed by  Ultrafast Spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
For highly efficient ultrathin solar cells, layered indium selenide (InSe), a
van der Waals solid, has shown a great promise. In this paper, we study the
coherent dynamics of charge carriers generation in {\gamma}-InSe single
crystals. We employ ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy to examine the
dynamics of hot electrons after resonant photoexcitation. To study the effect
of excess kinetic energy of electrons after creating A exciton (VB1 to CB
transition), we excite the sample with broadband pulses centered at 600, 650,
700 and 750 nm, respectively. We analyze the relaxation and recombination
dynamics in {\gamma}-InSe by global fitting approach. Five decay associated
spectra with their associated lifetimes are obtained, which have been assigned
to intraband vibrational relaxation and interband recombination processes. We
extract characteristic carrier thermalization times from 1 to 10 ps. To examine
the coherent vibrations accompanying intraband relaxation dynamics, we analyze
the kinetics by fitting to exponential functions and the obtained residuals are
further processed for vibrational analysis. A few key phonon coherences are
resolved and ab-initio quantum calculations reveal the nature of the associated
phonons. The wavelet analysis is employed to study the time evolution of the
observed coherences, which show that the low-frequency coherences last for more
than 5 ps. Associated calculations reveal that the contribution of the
intralayer phonon modes is the key determining factor for the scattering
between free electrons and lattice. Our results provide fundamental insights
into the photophysics in InSe and help to unravel their potential for
high-performance optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Patterning of multicomponent elastic shells by Gaussian curvature</h3>

<br>
<i>Curt Waltmann, Ahis Shrestha, Monica Olvera de la Cruz</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent findings suggest that shell protein distribution and morphology of
bacterial microcompartments regulate the chemical fluxes facilitating reactions
which dictate their biological function. We explore how the morphology and
component patterning are coupled through the competition of mean and Gaussian
bending energies in multicomponent elastic shells that form three component
irregular polyhedra. We observe two softer components with lower bending
rigidities allocate on the edges and vertices while the harder component
occupies the faces. When subjected to a non-zero interfacial line tension, the
two softer components further separate and pattern into subdomains that are
mediated by the Gaussian curvature. We find that this degree of fractionation
is maximized when there is a weaker line tension and when the ratio of bending
rigidities between the two softer domains $\approx 2$. Our results reveal a
patterning mechanism in multicomponent shells that can capture the observed
morphologies of bacterial microcompartments and, moreover, can be realized in
synthetic vesicles.

<h3>A quantitative theoretical model of the boson peak based on stringlet  excitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12839" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12839</a>
<br>
<i>Cunyuan Jiang, Matteo Baggioli, Jack F. Douglas</i>
<br>
<br>
The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states
over the phonon Debye contribution, is usually identified as one of the
distinguishing features between ordered crystals and amorphous solid materials.
Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery and
a consensus on its theoretical derivation has not yet been achieved. Recently,
it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem
from intrinsic localized modes which involve string-like excitations
("stringlets") having a one-dimensional (1D) nature. In this work, we build on
a theoretical framework originally proposed by Lund that describes the
localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size
distribution to be exponential, as observed in independent simulation studies.
We show that a generalization of this framework provides an analytically
prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well
below the glass transition temperature in both 2D and 3D amorphous systems. The
final result involves no free parameters and is in quantitative agreement with
prior simulation observations. Additionally, this stringlet theory of the BP
naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers
an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the
shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in cooled liquids.
Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping
for the stringlet modes at finite temperature which leads to a large
low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, as observed
in both experiments and simulations.

<h3>Coincidence detection probability of $(Î³, 2e)$ photoemission  measurement</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the study of the strongly correlated electrons, one of the challenging
core tasks is to develop the potential techniques for direct detection of the
many-body correlations of the strongly correlated electrons. $(\gamma, 2e)$
photoemission technique has been developed to investigate the two-body
correlations of the target correlated electrons. In this article, we will focus
on this technique for the correlated electrons near the Fermi energy. The
coincidence detection probability of the two emitted electrons in the $(\gamma,
2e)$ photoemission measurement is shown to be relevant to a two-body
Bethe-Salpeter wave function, which describes the dynamical two-body
correlations of the target correlated electrons. As the coincidence detection
probability involves an electron-electron interaction matrix element, the
arbitrary momentum and/or energy transfer due to this electron-electron
interaction makes the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique fail to reveal the
inner-pair structure of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function. However, the
center-of-mass momentum and energy of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function
can be distinctly resolved. Thus, the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique
can provide the center-of-mass physics of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave
function of the target correlated electrons. It would be one potential
technique to study the center-of-mass physics of the Cooper pairs in
superconductor.

<h3>Unconventional superconductivity protected from disorder on the kagome  lattice</h3>

<i>Sofie Castro HolbÃ¦k, Morten H. Christensen, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the kagome
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) metals, we perform a theoretical study of the
symmetry-allowed superconducting orders on the two-dimensional kagome lattice
with focus on their response to disorder. We uncover a qualitative difference
between the robustness of intraband spin-singlet (even-parity) and spin-triplet
(odd-parity) unconventional superconductivity to atomic-scale nonmagnetic
disorder. Due to the particular sublattice character of the electronic states
on the kagome lattice, disorder in spin-singlet superconducting phases becomes
non-pair-breaking despite the fact that the gap structure features sign
changes. By contrast, spin-triplet condensates remain fragile to disorder on
the kagome lattice. We demonstrate these effects in terms of the absence of
impurity bound states and an associated weak disorder-induced $T_c$-suppression
for spin-singlet order. We also discuss the consequences for quasi-particle
interference and their inherent tendency for momentum-space anisotropy due to
sublattice effects on the kagome lattice. For unconventional kagome
superconductors, our results imply that any allowed spin-singlet order,
including for example $d+id$-wave superconductivity, exhibits a
disorder-response qualitatively similar to standard conventional $s$-wave
superconductors.

The emergence of symmetry-breaking orders such as ferromagnetism and the weak
interlayer bonding in van der Waals materials, offers a unique platform to
engineer novel heterostructures and tune transport properties like thermal
conductivity. Here, we report the experimental and theoretical study of the
cross-plane thermal conductivity, $\kappa_\perp$, of the van der Waals 2D
ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. We observe a non-monotonic increase of
$\kappa_\perp$ with the thickness and a large suppression in
artificially-stacked layers, indicating a diffusive transport regime with
ballistic contributions. These results are supported by the theoretical
analyses of the accumulated thermal conductivity, which show an important
contribution of phonons with mean free paths between 10 and 200 nm. Moreover,
our experiments show a reduction of the $\kappa_\perp$ in the low-temperature
ferromagnetic phase occurring at the magnetic transition. The calculations show
that this reduction in $\kappa_\perp$ is associated with a decrease in the
group velocities of the acoustic phonons and an increase in the phonon-phonon
scattering of the Raman modes that couple to the magnetic phase. These results
demonstrate the potential of van der Waals ferromagnets for thermal transport
engineering.

We propose two methods for evaluating athermal recombination corrected (arc)
displacement damage parameters in ion irradiations employing the computer code
SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter). The first method consists of
post-processing the detailed SRIM output for all simulated damage events and
re-calculating according to the arc damage model. In the second method, an
approximate empirical formula is devised which gives the average displacements
in the arc damage model as a function of the corresponding quantity according
to the standard Norgett-Robinson-Torrens model, which is readily obtained from
SRIM.

<br>
<br>
Chemical substitution is commonly used to explore new ground states in
materials, yet the role of disorder is often overlooked. In Mn-substituted
BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (MnBFA), superconductivity (SC) is absent, despite being
observed for nominal hole-doped phases. Instead, a glassy magnetic phase
emerges, associated with the $S=5/2$ Mn local spins. In this work, we present a
comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of MnBFA using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that Mn causes
electron pockets to shrink, disrupting the nesting condition in MnBFA. Notably,
we propose that electronic disorder, along with magnetic scattering, primarily
contributes to suppressing the itinerant magnetic order in MnBFA. This finding
connects the MnBFA electronic band structure properties to the glassy magnetic
behavior observed in these materials and suggests that SC is absent because of
the collective magnetic impurity behavior that scatters the Fe-derived
excitations. Moreover, we suggest that Mn tunes MnBFA to a phase in between the
correlated metal in BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and the Hund insulator phase in
BaMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$.

<br>
<br>
Excitonic states trapped in harmonic moir\'e wells of twisted heterobilayers
is an intriguing testbed. However, the moir\'e potential is primarily governed
by the twist angle, and its dynamic tuning remains a challenge. Here we
demonstrate anharmonic tuning of moir\'e potential in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterobilayer through gate voltage and optical power. A gate voltage can result
in a local in-plane perturbing field with odd parity around the high-symmetry
points. This allows us to simultaneously observe the first (linear) and second
(parabolic) order Stark shift for the ground state and first excited state,
respectively, of the moir\'e trapped exciton - an effect opposite to
conventional quantum-confined Stark shift. Depending on the degree of
confinement, these excitons exhibit up to twenty-fold gate-tunability in the
lifetime ($100$ to $5$ ns). Also, exciton localization dependent dipolar
repulsion leads to an optical power-induced blueshift of $\sim$1 meV/$\mu$W - a
five-fold enhancement over previous reports.

<br>
<br>
In quasi-two-dimensional experiments with photoelastic particles confined to
an annular region, an intruder constrained to move in a circular path halfway
between the annular walls experiences stick-slip dynamics. We discuss the
response of the granular medium to the driven intruder, focusing on the
evolution of the force network during sticking periods. Because the available
experimental data does not include precise information about individual contact
forces, we use an approach developed in our previous work (Basak et al, J. Eng.
Mechanics (2021)) based on networks constructed from measurements of the
integrated strain magnitude on each particle. These networks are analyzed using
topological measures based on persistence diagrams, revealing that force
networks evolve smoothly but in a nontrivial manner throughout each sticking
period, even though the intruder and granular particles are stationary.
Characteristic features of persistence diagrams show identifiable changes as a
slip is approaching, indicating the existence of slip precursors. Key features
of the dynamics are similar for granular materials composed of disks or
pentagons, but some details are consistently different. In particular, we find
significantly larger fluctuations of the measures computed based on persistence
diagrams, and therefore of the underlying networks, for systems of pentagonal
particles.

The stochastic trajectories of molecules in living cells, as well as the
dynamics in many other complex systems, often exhibit memory in their path over
long periods of time. In addition, these systems can show dynamic
heterogeneities due to which the motion changes along the trajectories. Such
effects manifest themselves as spatiotemporal correlations. Despite the broad
occurrence of heterogeneous complex systems in nature, their analysis is still
quite poorly understood and tools to model them are largely missing. We
contribute to tackling this problem by employing an integral representation of
Mandelbrot's fractional Brownian motion that is compliant with varying motion
parameters while maintaining long memory. Two types of switching fractional
Brownian motion are analysed, with transitions arising from a Markovian
stochastic process and scale-free intermittent processes. We obtain simple
formulas for classical statistics of the processes, namely the mean squared
displacement and the power spectral density. Further, a method to identify
switching fractional Brownian motion based on the distribution of displacements
is described. A validation of the model is given for experimental measurements
of the motion of quantum dots in the cytoplasm of live mammalian cells that
were obtained by single-particle tracking.

Thermal rectifiers are devices that have different thermal conductivities in
opposing directions of heat flow. The realization of practical thermal
rectifiers relies significantly on a sound understanding of the underlying
mechanisms of asymmetric heat transport, and two-dimensional materials offer a
promising opportunity in this regard owing to their simplistic structures
together with a vast possibility of tunable imperfections. However, the
in-plane thermal rectification mechanisms in 2D materials like graphene having
directional gradients of grain sizes have remained elusive. In fact,
understanding the heat transport mechanisms in polycrystalline graphene, which
are more practical to synthesize than large-scale single-crystal graphene,
could potentially allow a unique opportunity to combine with other defects and
designs for effective optimization of the thermal rectification property. In
this work, we investigated the thermal rectification behavior in periodic
atomistic models of polycrystalline graphene whose grain arrangements were
generated semi-stochastically in order to have different gradient grain-density
distributions along the in-plane heat flow direction. We employed the centroid
Voronoi tessellation technique to generate realistic grain boundary structures
for graphene, and the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations method was
used to calculate the thermal conductivities and thermal rectification values.
Additionally, detailed phonon characteristics and propagating phonon spatial
energy densities were analyzed based on the fluctuation-dissipation theory to
elucidate the competitive interplay between two underlying mechanisms that
determine the degree of asymmetric heat flow in graded polycrystalline
graphene.

components at $T_P = 127$ K. We follow their doping dependence as Sn is
replaced with In, which causes a reduction of $T_C$ and $T_P$. Importantly,
both transitions follow the same doping dependence, indicating a single energy
scale involved with both processes.
