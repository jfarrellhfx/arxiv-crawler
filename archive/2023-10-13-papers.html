<h3>$T$-linear conductance in electron hydrodynamics</h3>

A $T$-linear temperature dependence of transport coefficients in metals is
habitually viewed as a signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics, whereas the the
hallmark of Fermi-liquid physics is a $T^2$ scaling. Here we demonstrate that
two-dimensional electron fluids with simple Fermi surfaces feature conductivity
that scales linearly with temperature. The $T$-linear scaling originates from
nonclassical hydrodynamics in 2D Fermi systems governed by long-lived
excitations and non-Newtonian viscous modes. This behavior stands in sharp
contrast with the conventional Gurzhi hydrodynamics in 3D systems that features
a $T^2$ scaling of conductivity. The linear $T$ dependence, predicted to occur
in a wide range of temperatures, provides a smoking gun for nonclassical
hydrodynamics. These findings explain the linear $T$ dependence of conductance
recently measured in 2D electron fluids.

<h3>Wigner crystallization in Bernal bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07751" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07751</a>
<br>
<i>Sandeep Joy, Brian Skinner</i>
<br>
<br>
In Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG), a perpendicular displacement field flattens
the bottom of the conduction band and thereby facilitates the formation of
strongly-correlated electron states at low electron density. Here, we focus on
the Wigner crystal (WC) state, which appears in a certain regime of
sufficiently large displacement field, low electron density, and low
temperature. We first consider a model of BBG without trigonal warping, and we
show theoretically that Berry curvature leads to a new kind of WC state in
which the electrons acquire a spontaneous orbital magnetization when the
displacement field exceeds a critical value. We then consider the effects of
trigonal warping in BBG, and we show that they lead to an unusual ``doubly
re-entrant" behavior of the WC phase as a function of density. The rotational
symmetry breaking associated with trigonal warping leads to a nontrivial
``minivalley order" in the WC state, which changes abruptly at a critical value
of displacement field. In both cases, we estimate the phase boundary of the WC
state in terms of density, displacement field, and temperature.

<h3>Extended critical phase in quasiperiodic quantum Hall systems</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider the effects of quasiperiodic spatial modulation on the quantum
Hall plateau transition, by analyzing the Chalker-Coddington network model for
the integer quantum Hall transition with quasiperiodically modulated link
phases. In the conventional case (uncorrelated random phases), there is a
critical point separating topologically distinct integer quantum Hall
insulators. Surprisingly, the quasiperiodic version of the model supports an
extended critical phase for some angles of modulation. We characterize this
critical phase and the transitions between critical and insulating phases. For
quasiperiodic potentials with two incommensurate wavelengths, the transitions
we find are in a different universality class from the random transition. Upon
adding more wavelengths they undergo a crossover to the uncorrelated random
case. We expect our results to be relevant to the quantum Hall phases of
twisted bilayer graphene or other Moir\'e systems with large unit cells.

<h3>Tunable non-Fermi liquid phase from coupling to two-level systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07768</a>
<br>
<i>Noga Bashan, Evyatar Tulipman, Jörg Schmalian, Erez Berg</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a controlled large-$N$ theory of electrons coupled to dynamical
two-level systems (TLSs) via spatially-random interactions. Such a physical
situation arises when electrons scatter off low-energy excitations in a
metallic glass, such as a charge or stripe glass. Our theory is governed by a
non-Gaussian saddle point, which maps to the celebrated spin-boson model. By
tuning the coupling strength we find that the model crosses over from a Fermi
liquid at weak coupling to an extended region of non-Fermi liquid behavior at
strong coupling, and realizes a marginal Fermi liquid at the crossover. Beyond
a critical coupling strength, the TLSs freeze and Fermi-liquid behavior is
restored. Our results are valid for generic space dimensions $d>1$.

<h3>Multifunctional magnetic oxide-MoS$_2$ heterostructures on silicon</h3>

<br>
<br>
Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing
future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their
integration with other materials, especially on Si-based platforms, is
challenging. Here, van der Waals heterostructures of
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO), a correlated manganite perovskite, and
MoS$_2$ are demonstrated on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome
the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving
freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force-mediated transfer are used
to fabricate the LSMO-MoS$_2$ heterostructures. The LSMO-MoS$_2$
heterostructures exhibit a gate-tunable rectifying behavior, based on which
metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) with on-off ratios of
over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO-MoS$_2$ heterostructures can function as
photodiodes displaying considerable open-circuit voltages and photocurrents. In
addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO-MoS$_2$
heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room
temperature. This work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO-MoS$_2$
heterostructure devices on Si-based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm
to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate
properties.

<h3>The Fractal-Lattice Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07813</a>
<br>
<i>Monica Conte, Vinicius Zampronio, Malte Röntgen, Cristiane Morais Smith</i>
<br>
<br>
Here, we investigate the fractal-lattice Hubbard model using various
numerical methods: exact diagonalization, the self-consistent diagonalization
of a (mean-field) Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian and state-of-the-art Auxiliary-Field
Quantum Monte Carlo. We focus on the Sierpinski triangle with Hausdorff
dimension $1.58$ and consider several generations. In the tight-binding limit,
we find compact localised states, which are also explained in terms of symmetry
and linked to the formation of a ferrimagnetic phase at weak interaction.
Simulations at half-filling revealed the persistence of this type of magnetic
order for every value of interaction strength and a Mott transition for U/t
$\sim$ 4.5. In addition, we found a remarkable dependence on the Hausdorff
dimension regarding $i)$ the number of compact localised states in different
generations, $ii)$ the scaling of the total many-body ground-state energy in
the tight-binding limit, and $iii)$ the density of the states at the corners of
the lattice for specific values of electronic filling. Moreover, in the
presence of an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, the zero-energy compact localized
states become entangled and give rise to inner and outer corner modes.

<h3>Quantitative Analysis of MoS$_2$ Thin Film Micrographs with Machine  Learning</h3>

Isolating the features associated with different materials growth conditions
is important to facilitate the tuning of these conditions for effective
materials growth and characterization. This study presents machine learning
models for classifying atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of thin film
MoS$_2$ based on their growth temperatures. By employing nine different
algorithms and leveraging transfer learning through a pretrained ResNet model,
we identify an effective approach for accurately discerning the characteristics
related to growth temperature within the AFM micrographs. Robust models with up
to 70% test accuracies were obtained, with the best performing algorithm being
an end-to-end ResNet fine-tuned on our image domain. Class activation maps and
occlusion attribution reveal that crystal quality and domain boundaries play
crucial roles in classification, with models exhibiting the ability to identify
latent features beyond human visual perception. Overall, the models
demonstrated high accuracy in identifying thin films grown at different
temperatures despite limited and imbalanced training data as well as variation
in growth parameters besides temperature, showing that our models and training
protocols are suitable for this and similar predictive tasks for accelerated 2D
materials characterization.

<h3>Precise Fermi-level engineering in a topological Weyl semimetal via fast  ion implantation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The precise controllability of the Fermi level is a critical aspect of
quantum materials. For topological Weyl semimetals, there is a pressing need to
fine-tune the Fermi level to the Weyl nodes and unlock exotic electronic and
optoelectronic effects associated with the divergent Berry curvature. However,
in contrast to 2D materials, where the Fermi level can be controlled through
various techniques, the situation for bulk crystals beyond laborious chemical
doping poses significant challenges. Here, we report the meV-level
ultra-fine-tuning of the Fermi level of bulk topological Weyl semimetal TaP
using accelerator-based high-energy hydrogen implantation and theory-driven
planning. By calculating the desired carrier density and controlling the
accelerator profiles, the Fermi level can be fine-tuned from 5 meV to only
$\sim$0.5 meV (DFT calculations) away from the Weyl nodes. The Weyl nodes are
preserved, while the carrier mobility is largely retained. Our work
demonstrates the viability of this generic approach to tune the Fermi level in
semimetal systems and could serve to achieve property fine-tuning for other
bulk quantum materials with ultrahigh precision.

<h3>Mid-Infrared Detectors and Imagers Integrating All-Group IV Nanowires</h3>

Cost-effective mid-wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronic devices are of utmost
importance to a plethora of applications such as night vision, thermal sensing,
autonomous vehicles, free-space communication, and spectroscopy. To this end,
leveraging the ubiquitous silicon-based processing has emerged as a powerful
strategy that can be accomplished through the use of group IV germanium-tin
(GeSn) alloys. Indeed, due to their compatibility with silicon and their
tunable bandgap energy covering the entire MWIR range, GeSn semiconductors are
frontrunner platforms for compact and scalable MWIR technologies. However, the
GeSn large lattice parameter has been a major hurdle limiting the quality of
GeSn epitaxy on silicon wafers. Herein, it is shown that sub-20 nm Ge nanowires
(NWs) provide effective compliant substrates to grow Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ alloys
with a composition uniformity over several micrometers with a very limited
build-up of the compressive strain. Ge/Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ core/shell NWs with
Sn content spanning the 6 to 18 at.$\%$ range are demonstrated and integrated
in photoconductive devices exhibiting a high signal-to-noise ratio at room
temperature and a tunable cutoff wavelength covering the 2.0 $\mu$m to 3.9
$\mu$m range. Additionally, the processed NW-based detectors were used in
uncooled imagers enabling the acquisition of high-quality images under both
broadband and laser illuminations without a lock-in technique.

<h3>Charge Separation at Interfaces of Phase-Separated Coacervates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07835</a>
<br>
<i>Arghya Majee, Christoph A. Weber, Frank Jülicher</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theory for phase-separated liquid coacervates with salt, taking
into account spatial heterogeneities and interfacial profiles. We find that
charged layers of alternating sign can form around the interface while the bulk
phases remain approximately charge-neutral. We show that the salt concentration
regulates the number of layers and the amplitude of the layer's charge density
and electrostatic potential. Such charged layers can either repel or attract
single-charged molecules diffusing across the interface. Our theory could be
relevant for artificial systems and biomolecular condensates in cells. Our work
suggests that interfaces of biomolecular condensates could mediate
charge-specific transport similar to membrane-bound compartments.

<h3>Revolutionising inverse design of magnesium alloys through generative  adversarial networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07836" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07836</a>

The utility of machine learning (ML) techniques in materials science has
accelerated materials design and discovery. However, the accuracy of ML models
- particularly deep neural networks - heavily relies on the quality and
quantity of the training data. Data collection methods often have limitations
arising from cost, difficulty, and resource-intensive human efforts. Thus,
limited high-quality data, especially for novel materials, poses a significant
challenge in developing reliable ML models. Generative adversarial networks
(GANs) offer one solution to augment datasets through synthetic sample
generation. The present work explores the application of GANs in magnesium (Mg)
alloy design, by training two deep neural networks within the structure of a
Wasserstein GAN to generate new (novel) alloys with desired mechanical
properties. This data augmentation-based strategy contributes to model
robustness, particularly in cases where traditional data collection is
impractical. The approach presented may expedite Mg alloy development, through
a GAN assisted inverse design approach.

<h3>Towards a complete mean-field theory for the ductile and brittle  yielding of amorphous solids: beyond the paradigm of the Ising model in a  random field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07843</a>
<br>
<i>Jack T. Parley, Peter Sollich</i>
<br>
<br>
Developing a unified theory describing both ductile and brittle yielding
constitutes a fundamental challenge of non-equilibrium statistical physics.
Recently, it has been proposed that the nature of the yielding transition is
controlled by physics akin to that of the quasistatically driven Random field
Ising model (RFIM), which has served as the paradigm for understanding the
effect of quenched disorder in slowly driven systems with short-ranged
interactions. However, this theoretical picture neglects both the dynamics of,
and the elasticity-induced long-ranged interactions between, the mesoscopic
material constituents. Here, we address these two aspects and provide a unified
theory building on the H\'ebraud-Lequeux elastoplastic description. The first
aspect is crucial to understanding the competition between the imposed
deformation rate and the finite timescale of plastic rearrangements: we provide
a dynamical description of the macroscopic stress drop and predictions for the
divergence of the peak susceptibility with inverse shear rate. The second is
essential in order to capture properly the behaviour in the limit of
quasistatic driving, where avalanches of plasticity diverge with system size at
any value of the strain. We fully characterise the avalanche behaviour, which
is radically different to that of the RFIM. In the quasistatic, infinite size
limit, we find that both models have mean-field Landau exponents, obscuring the
effect of the interactions. We show, however, that the latter profoundly affect
the behaviour of finite systems approaching the spinodal-like brittle yield
point, where we recover qualitatively the finite-size trends found in particle
simulations, and modify the nature of the random critical point separating
ductile and brittle yielding, where we predict critical behaviour on top of the
marginality present at any value of the strain.

<h3>Towards Foundation Models for Materials Science: The Open MatSci ML  Toolkit</h3>

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have shown great promise in
their ability to accelerate novel materials discovery. As researchers and
domain scientists seek to unify and consolidate chemical knowledge, the case
for models with potential to generalize across different tasks within materials
science - so-called "foundation models" - grows with ambitions. This manuscript
reviews our recent progress with development of Open MatSci ML Toolkit, and
details experiments that lay the groundwork for foundation model research and
development with our framework. First, we describe and characterize a new
pretraining task that uses synthetic data generated from symmetry operations,
and reveal complex training dynamics at large scales. Using the pretrained
model, we discuss a number of use cases relevant to foundation model
development: semantic architecture of datasets, and fine-tuning for property
prediction and classification. Our key results show that for simple
applications, pretraining appears to provide worse modeling performance than
training models from random initialization. However, for more complex
instances, such as when a model is required to learn across multiple datasets
and types of targets simultaneously, the inductive bias from pretraining
provides significantly better performance. This insight will hopefully inform
subsequent efforts into creating foundation models for materials science
applications.

<h3>Cover times of many random walkers on a discrete network</h3>

<br>
<i>Hyunjoong Kim, Sean D Lawley</i>
<br>
<br>
The speed of an exhaustive search can be measured by a cover time, which is
defined as the time it takes a random searcher to visit every state in some
target set. Cover times have been studied in both the physics and probability
literatures, with most prior works focusing on a single searcher. In this
paper, we prove an explicit formula for all the moments of the cover time for
many searchers on an arbitrary discrete network. Our results show that such
cover times depend only on properties of the network along the shortest paths
to the most distant parts of the target. This mere local dependence contrasts
with the well-known result that cover times for single searchers depend on
global properties of the network. We illustrate our rigorous results by
stochastic simulations.

<h3>Thickness-dependent Characteristics and Oxidation of Cadmium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07909</a>
<br>
<i>Arda Gulucu, Hasan Sahin</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, the structural, electronic and vibrational properties of
thinnest possible Cadmium crystal are investigated by performing
first-principle calculations. Total energy optimization and dynamic stability
calculations reveal that the thinnest possible crystal structure is a
double-layered structure consisting of alternating layers formed by trigonal
arrangements of Cd atoms. Excessive softening of optical phonons occurs as a
result of structural relaxation when going from a bulk to a single layer (SL)
structure. It is also shown that thinnest structure obtained from bulk Cd
crystals maintains its metallic feature despite the dimensional crossover. In
addition, it is predicted through calculations that the SL Cd crystal strongly
interacts with oxygen and that the oxidized regions even undergo chemical
transformation to form the CdO crystal. In the double-layer CdO crystal
resulting from the oxidation of individual Cd layers, the layers are connected
to each other with strong covalent bonds, and this structure is a semiconductor
with a band gap of 2.10 eV. While the robust metallic structure of the thinnest
possible Cd crystal provides flexibility in terms of its use in nanoscale
applications, on the other hand, the fact that its electronic properties can be
changed by oxidation is important for optoelectronic device applications.

<h3>Rheological signatures of a glass-glass transition in an aging colloidal  clay</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07910</a>

<br>
<br>
The occurrence of non-equilibrium transitions between arrested states has
recently emerged as an intriguing issue in the field of soft glassy materials.
The existence of one such transition has been suggested for aging colloidal
clays (Laponite$^{\circledR}$ suspensions) at weight concentration 3.0%,
although further experimental evidences are necessary to validate this
scenario. Here, we test the occurrence of this transition for spontaneously
aged (non-rejuvenated) samples, by exploiting the rheological tools of
Dynamical Mechanical Analysis. On imposing consecutive compression cycles to
differently aged clay suspensions, we find that a quite abrupt change of
rheological parameters occurs for ages around three days. For the Young and
elastic moduli, the change with the waiting time is essentially independent
from the deformation rate, whereas other "fluid-like" properties, such as the
loss modulus, do clearly display some rate dependence. We also show that the
crossover identified by rheology coincides with deviations of the relaxation
time (obtained through X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy) from its expected
monotonic increase with aging. Thus, our results robustly support the existence
of a glass-glass transition in aging colloidal clays, highlighting
characteristic features of of their viscoelastic behaviour.

<h3>The emergence of the de Haas van Alphen Effect on the deformed Graphene</h3>

A study of strongly curved graphene magnetization and magnetic susceptibility
is carried out. Through a Dirac model complemented with a tight-binding model
analysis, we are able to show that mechanical deformations solve the
long-standing problem of graphene's theoretically calculated diamagnetic
divergence at low temperatures. This suggests that corrugations and mechanical
defects in graphene are the cause of finite experimentally measurable magnetic
susceptibility. Furthermore, a mechanical effect is also found due to an
electronic contribution, which produces a pseudo-de Haas van Alphen (dHvA)
effect. This effect is related to oscillating (electronic) forces that oppose
deformations; these forces are divergent in flat graphene, indicating that
graphene (without substrate) achieves mechanical equilibrium by corrugations.
In addition, paramagnetism is predicted for graphene with negative curvature
under strong magnetic fields.

<h3>Enhanced sampling of Crystal Nucleation with Graph Representation Learnt  Variables</h3>

<i>Ziyue Zou, Pratyush Tiwary</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, we present a graph neural network-based learning approach
using an autoencoder setup to derive low-dimensional variables from features
observed in experimental crystal structures. These variables are then biased in
enhanced sampling to observe state-to-state transitions and reliable
thermodynamic weights. Our approach uses simple convolution and pooling
methods. To verify the effectiveness of our protocol, we examined the
nucleation of various allotropes and polymorphs of iron and glycine from their
molten states. Our graph latent variables when biased in well-tempered
metadynamics consistently show transitions between states and achieve accurate
free energy calculations in agreement with experiments, both of which are
indicators of dependable sampling. This underscores the strength and promise of
our graph neural net variables for improved sampling. The protocol shown here
should be applicable for other systems and with other sampling methods.

Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are comprised of layers of atomically
thin sheets, making them ideal platforms for studying magnetism at the
two-dimensional (2D) limit. These materials are at the center of a host of
novel types of experiments, however, there are notably few pathways to directly
probe their magnetic structure. We report the magnetic order within a single
crystal of NiPS$_3$ and show it can be accessed with resonant elastic X-ray
diffraction along the edge of the vdW planes in a carefully grown crystal by
detecting structurally forbidden resonant magnetic X-ray scattering. We find
the magnetic order parameter has a critical exponent of $\beta\sim0.36$,
indicating that the magnetism of these vdW crystals is more adequately
characterized by the three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg universality class. We
verify these findings with first-principle density functional theory,
Monte-Carlo simulations, and density matrix renormalization group calculations.

<h3>Charge-Driven Liquid-Crystalline Behavior of Ligand-Functionalized  Nanorods in Apolar Solvent</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07959</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Concentrated colloidal suspensions of nanorods often exhibit
liquid-crystalline (LC) behavior. The transition to a nematic LC phase, with
long-range orientational order of the particles, is usually well captured by
Onsager's theory for hard rods, at least qualitatively. The theory shows how
the volume fraction at the transition decreases with increasing aspect ratio of
the rods. It also explains that the long-range electrostatic repulsive
interaction occurring between rods stabilized by their surface charge can
significantly increase their effective diameter, resulting in a decrease of the
volume fraction at the transition, as compared to sterically stabilized rods.
Here, we report on a system of ligand-stabilized LaPO4 nanorods, of aspect
ratio around 11, dispersed in apolar medium exhibiting the counter-intuitive
observation that the onset of nematic self-assembly occurs at an extremely low
volume fraction of around 0.25%, which is lower than observed (around 3%) with
the same particles when charge-stabilized in polar solvent. Furthermore, the
nanorod volume fraction at the transition increases with increasing
concentration of ligands, in a similar way as in polar media where increasing
the ionic strength leads to surface-charge screening. This peculiar system was
investigated by dynamic light scattering, Fourier-Transform Infra-Red
spectroscopy, zetametry, electron microscopy, polarized-light microscopy,
photoluminescence measurements, and X-ray scattering. Based on these
experimental data, we formulate several tentative scenarios that might explain
this unexpected phase behavior. However, at this stage, its full understanding
remains a pending theoretical challenge. Nevertheless, this study shows that
dispersing anisotropic nanoparticles in an apolar solvent may sometimes lead to
spontaneous ordering events that defy our intuitive ideas about colloidal
systems.

symmetries of the semi-vortex (SV) and mixed-mode (MM) types, which can be
created in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates of Rydberg atoms under the action
of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By means of systematic numerical
computations, we demonstrate that the interplay of SOC and long-range
spherically symmetric Rydberg interactions stabilize the 3D solitons, improving
their resistance to collapse. We find how the stability range depends on the
strengths of the SOC and Rydberg interactions and the soft-core atomic radius.

We study Anderson localization in disordered tight-binding models on
hyperbolic lattices. Such lattices are geometries intermediate between ordinary
two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which localize at infinitesimal disorder,
and Bethe lattices, which localize at strong disorder. Using state-of-the-art
computational group theory methods to create large systems, we approximate the
thermodynamic limit through appropriate periodic boundary conditions and
numerically demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization transition on
the $\{8,3\}$ and $\{8,8\}$ lattices. We find unusually large critical disorder
strengths and determine critical exponents.

<br>
<br>
We apply a strong magnetic field to a kagome Mott insulator with
antiferromagnetic interactions which does not show magnetic ordering down to
low temperatures. We observe a plateau at magnetization 1/9 Bohr magneton per
magnetic ion (Cu). Furthermore, in the vicinity of this plateau we observe sets
of strong oscillations in the magnetic torque, reminiscent of quantum
oscillations in metals. Such oscillations have never been seen in a wide gap
insulator and point to an exotic origin. While the temperature dependence of
these oscillations follows Fermi-liquid-theory predictions, they are
approximately periodic in the magnetic field $H$, as opposed to $1/H$ in
conventional metals. Furthermore, a strong angular dependence is observed for
the period, which indicates an orbital origin for this effect. We show that the
1/9 plateau and the associated oscillations are consistent with the appearance
of a quantum-spin-liquid state whose excitations are fermionic spinons that
obey a Dirac spectrum. The oscillations are in response to an emergent gauge
field. Our results provide strong evidence that fractionalized particles
coupled to the elusive emergent gauge field have been observed.

<br>
We report the transport properties of ${\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$/bilayer graphene
heterostructures, where carrier doping is induced by a work function
difference, resulting in distinct electron and hole populations in
${\alpha}$-RuCl3 and bilayer graphene, respectively. Through a comprehensive
analysis of multi-channel transport signatures, including Hall measurements and
quantum oscillation, we unveil significant band modifications within the
system. In particular, we observe the emergence of spin and valley polarized
multiple hole-type Fermi pockets, originating from the spin-selective band
hybridization between ${\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$ and bilayer graphene, breaking the
spin degree of freedom. Unlike ${\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$ /monolayer graphene system,
the presence of different hybridization strengths between ${\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$
and the top and bottom graphene layers leads to an asymmetric behavior of the
two layers, confirmed by effective mass experiments, resulting in the
manifestation of valley-polarized Fermi pockets. These compelling findings
establish ${\alpha}$-RuCl$_3$ proximitized to bilayer graphene as an
outstanding platform for engineering its unique low-energy band structure.

<h3>What can we learn from the experiment of electrostatic conveyer for  excitons?</h3>

<br>
<i>T. T. Zhao, C. S. Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the experiment of electrostatic conveyer for indirect excitons
[A. G. Winbow, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 196806 (2011)], we studied the
exciton patterns to understand the exciton dynamics. By analyzing the exciton
diffusion, we found that the patterns were from two kinds of excitons
approximately. The patterns near the laser spot came from the hot excitons
which can be taken as classical particles. However, the patterns far from the
laser spot were formed by the cooled excitons or coherent excitons. Considering
the Bosonic excitons with the limited lifetime and the interactions, we set up
a time-dependent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation including the non-Hermitian
dissipation to depict the coherent exciton dynamics. The real-time and
imaginary-time evolutions were used alternately to solve the Schr\"odinger
equation to study the exciton diffusion accompanied by the exciton cooling in
the moving lattices. By calculating the escape probability, we got
theoretically the transport distances of the coherent excitons in the conveyer
which is consistent with the experimental data. The exciton cooling speed was
found to be the key element to the coherent exciton transport. Moreover, the
plateau in the average transport distance as a function of the conveyer
amplitude cannot be explained by the dynamical localization-delocalization
transition due to the disorder.

We present a detailed exposition of the design for time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy using a UV probe laser source that combines the
nonlinear effects of \b{eta}-BaB2O4 and KBe2BO3F2 optical crystals. The photon
energy of the probe laser can be switched between 6.0 and 7.2 eV, with the
flexibility to operate each photon energy setting under two distinct resolution
configurations. Under the fully optimized energy resolution configuration, we
achieve an energy resolution of 8.5 meV at 6.0 eV and 10 meV at 7.2 eV.
Alternatively, switching to the other configuration enhances temporal
resolution, yielding a temporal resolution of 72 fs for 6.0 eV and 185 fs for
7.2 eV. We validated the performance and reliability of our system by applying
it to measuring two typical materials: the topological insulator MnBi2Te4 and
excitonic insulator candidate Ta2NiSe5.

The exploration of ferroelectric phase transitions enables an in-depth
understanding of ferroelectric switching and promising applications in
information storage. However, controllably tuning the dynamics of ferroelectric
phase transitions remains challenging owing to inaccessible hidden phases.
Here, using protonic gating technology, we create a series of metastable
ferroelectric phases and demonstrate their reversible transitions in van der
Waals ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 transistors. By varying the gate bias,
protons can be incrementally injected or extracted, achieving controllable
tuning of the ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 protonic dynamics across the
channel and obtaining numerous intermediate phases. Combining piezoelectric
force microscopy and electrical hysteresis measurements, we surprisingly
discover that the gate tuning of {\alpha}-In2Se3 protonation is volatile,
unlike the conventional gating effect, and the created new phases remain polar.
Their origin, revealed by first-principles calculations, is related to the
formation of metastable hydrogen-stabilized {\alpha}-In2Se3 phases with
switchable dipoles. Furthermore, our approach enables ultralow gate-voltage
switching of different phases (below 0.4 V), and easy integration with
transistor components. This work provides fundamental insights into the
interactions between protons and ferroelectric phase transitions, providing a
possible avenue for accessing hidden phases in ferroelectric switching and for
developing energy-efficient, multilevel-switching memory devices.

<h3>Self acceleration from spectral geometry in dissipative quantum-walk  dynamics</h3>

Dynamic behaviors of a physical system often originate from its spectral
properties. In open systems, where the effective non-Hermitian description
enables a wealth of spectral structures on the complex plane, the concomitant
dynamics is significantly enriched, whereas the identification and
comprehension of the underlying connections are challenging. Here we
experimentally demonstrate the correspondence between the transient self
acceleration of local excitations and the non-Hermitian spectral topology using
lossy photonic quantum walks. Focusing first on one-dimensional quantum walks,
we show that the measured short-time acceleration of the wave function is
proportional to the area enclosed by the eigenspectrum. We then reveal similar
correspondence in two-dimension quantum walks, where the self acceleration is
proportional to the volume enclosed by the eigenspectrum in the complex
parameter space. In both dimensions, the transient self acceleration crosses
over to a long-time behavior dominated by a constant flow at the drift
velocity. Our results unveil the universal correspondence between spectral
topology and transient dynamics, and offer a sensitive probe for phenomena in
non-Hermitian systems that originate from spectral geometry.

<h3>Gate-controlled suppression of light-driven proton transport through  graphene electrodes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent experiments demonstrated that proton transport through graphene
electrodes can be accelerated by over an order of magnitude with low intensity
illumination. Here we show that this photo-effect can be suppressed for a
tuneable fraction of the infrared spectrum by applying a voltage bias. Using
photocurrent measurements and Raman spectroscopy, we show that such fraction
can be selected by tuning the Fermi energy of electrons in graphene with a
bias, a phenomenon controlled by Pauli blocking of photo-excited electrons.
These findings demonstrate a dependence between graphene's electronic and
proton transport properties and provide fundamental insights into molecularly
thin electrode-electrolyte interfaces and their interaction with light.

<br>
In recent years, notable progress has been made in the study of hole qubits
in planar germanium, and circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) has
emerged as a promising approach for achieving long-range coupling and scaling
up of qubits. Here, we demonstrate the coupling between holes in a planar
germanium double quantum dot (DQD) and photons in a microwave cavity.
Specifically, a real-time calibrated virtual gate method is developed to
characterize this hybrid system, which in turn allows us to determine the
typical parameters sequentially through single-parameter fitting instead of
conventional multi-parameter fitting with additional uncertainty, and gives the
hole-photon coupling rate of $g_0/2\pi$ = 21.7 MHz. This work is a step toward
further research on hole-photon interactions and long-range qubit coupling in
planar germanium. The experimental method developed in this work contributes to
the more accurate and efficient characterization of hybrid cavity-QED systems.

<h3>Interaction quenches in nonzero temperature fermionic condensates</h3>

<br>
<br>
We revisit the study of amplitude oscillations in a pair condensate of
fermions after an interaction quench, and generalize it to nonzero temperature.
For small variations of the order parameter, we show that the energy transfer
during the quench determines both the asymptotic pseudo-equilibrated value of
the order parameter and the magnitude of the oscillations, after multiplication
by, respectively, the static response of the order parameter and spectral
weight of the pair-breaking threshold. Since the energy transferred to the
condensed pairs decreases with temperature as the superfluid contact, the
oscillations eventually disappear at the critical temperature. For deeper
quenches, we generalize the regimes of persistent oscillations and monotonic
decay to nonzero temperatures, and explain how they become more abrupt and are
more easily entered at high temperatures when the ratio of the initial to final
gap either diverges, when quenching towards the normal phase, or tends to zero,
when quenching towards the superfluid phase. Our results are directly relevant
for existing and future experiments on the non-equilibrium evolution of Fermi
superfluids near the phase transition.

The Anderson-Higgs mechanism provides mass to the photon in a superconductor,
resulting in the Meissner effect, representing a one-to-one analogy to
high-energy physics. We report on the direct observation of the Higgs
excitation in d-wave high-temperature superconductors by developing an
innovative technique to study the Higgs mode after a soft quench of the
Mexican-hat free-energy potential by light: Non-Equilibrium Anti-Stokes Raman
Scattering (NEARS) identifies the Higgs mode by its distinct characteristic
symmetry-dependent excitation energy below twice the energy of the
superconducting gap of optimally-doped Bi-2212. Disentangling the Higgs mode
from different types of superconductivity-induced excitations opens the avenue
for Higgs spectroscopy and provides a unique pathway to study exotic forms of
superconductivity at interfaces and in transient states.

<h3>Optimising motion-induced spin transfer</h3>

In this paper, the spin tunnelling transport between two ferromagnetic
insulators is studied. There is a narrow gap between the ferromagnetic
insulators so that they are weakly interacting with each other. One of the
ferromagnetic insulators is moving at a constant speed while the other is at
rest; hence, the system is out of equilibrium. In the presence of the shearing
motion, the interaction amplitude is periodically modulated at the Doppler
frequency. A unitary transformation allows us to regard the periodic modulation
of the interaction amplitude as an effective potential, which drives the spin
tunnelling transport. The amount of the spin current is controlled by the
spectral overlap and the carrier population difference between the two
ferromagnetic media. If the spectra of the two ferromagnets are moderately
broadened, the overlap in the spectral domain increases, enlarging the spin
current. However, too much broadening spoils the spectral overlap and, hence,
the spin current. This implies that there is an optimal condition for
maximising the spin transfer.

<br>
<br>
Carnivory in plants is an unusual trait that has arisen multiple times,
independently, throughout evolutionary history. Plants in the genus Genlisea
are carnivorous, and feed on microorganisms that live in soil using modified
subterranean leaf structures (rhizophylls). A surprisingly broad array of
microfauna has been observed in the plants' digestive chambers, including
ciliates, amoebae and soil mites. Here we show, through experiments and
simulations, that Genlisea exploit active matter physics to 'rectify' bacterial
swimming and establish a local flux of bacteria through the structured
environment of the rhizophyll towards the plant's digestion vesicle. In
contrast, macromolecular digestion products are free to diffuse away from the
digestion vesicle and establish a concentration gradient of carbon sources to
draw larger microorganisms further inside the plant. Our experiments and
simulations show that this mechanism is likely to be a localised one, and that
no large-scale efflux of digested matter is present.

<h3>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of the Jeff = 1/2 Mott insulator  Sr2IrO4 from the density-functional theory</h3>

<i>V.N. Antonov, D.A. Kukusta, L.V. Bekenov</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated the electronic structure of Sr2IrO4 within the
density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation while
taking into account strong Coulomb correlations in the framework of the fully
relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear MT orbital band structure method. We
have investigated the x-ray absorption spectra, x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra at the Ir L3 and O K
edges. The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data.
The RIXS spectrum of Sr2IrO4 at the Ir L3 edge in addition to the elastic
scattering peak at 0 eV possesses a sharp feature below 1.5 eV corresponding to
transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2 eV to 5 eV
is due to t2g-eg transitions. The third wide structure situated at 5-12 eV
appears due to transitions between the Ir 5d_O states derived from the tails of
oxygen 2p states and eg and t2g states. The RIXS spectrum of Sr2IrO4 at the O K
edge consists of three major inelastic excitations at 0.7 eV, 3.5 eV, and
around 6.2 eV. We have found that the first low energy feature is due to
interband transitions between occupied and empty O t2g transitions, which
appear due to the strong hybridization between oxygen 2p and Ir t2g states in
the close vicinity of the Fermi level. The next two peaks at around 3.5 and 6.2
eV reflect the interband transitions from the occupied O 2p states and the
empty oxygen states which arise from the hybridization with Ir t2g and eg
states, respectively. We have found that the theory reproduces well the shape
and energy position of the low energy feature, but the second and the third
peaks are shifted towards smaller energy in comparison with the experimental
measurements.

Pseudopotential locality errors have hampered the applications of the
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method in materials containing transition metals,
in particular oxides. We have developed locality error free effective core
potentials, pseudo-Hamiltonians, for transition metals ranging from Cr to Zn.
We have modified a procedure published by some of us in [M.C. Bennett et al,
JCTC 18 (2022)]. We carefully optimized our pseudo-Hamiltonians and achieved
transferability errors comparable to the best semilocal pseudopotentials used
with DMC but without incurring in locality errors. Our pseudo-Hamiltonian set
(named OPH23) bears the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of
many-body-first-principles calculations in fundamental science research of
complex materials involving transition metals.

A two-dimensional superconducting adlayer grown on a magnetic topological
insulator (MTI) has the potential to exhibit proximity induced
superconductivity, facilitate the existence of Majorana fermions and find
applications in the field of quantum computing. In this work, we demonstrate
the formation of bilayer stanene on an MTI substrate, specifically
Mn(Bi$_{0.74}$Sb$_{0.26}$)$_2$Te$_4$ (MBST), through utilization of a
combination of techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT),
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and low energy electron diffraction
(LEED). The stanene related bands observed in ARPES have been corroborated by
our DFT calculations. Atomic resolution STM topography images confirm the
formation of monolayer as well as bilayer stanene. A buffer layer -- formed due
to chemical bonding of Sn with the upper two layers of MBST (Te and Bi/Sb) --
facilitates the growth of stanene.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have received extensive research attentions
over the past two decades due to their intriguing physical properties (such as
the ultrahigh mobility and strong light-matter interaction at atomic thickness)
and a broad range of potential applications (especially in the fields of

emphasis on single crystals. We first summarize the major growth strategies for
monolayer 2D single crystals. Following that, we discuss the growth of
multilayer single crystals, including the control of thickness, stacking
sequence, and heterostructure composition. Then we highlight the exploration of
2D single crystals in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Finally, a
perspective is given to outline the research opportunities and the remaining
challenges in this field.

We propose and study a simple, physical model for phagocytosis, i.e. the
active, actin-mediated uptake of micron-sized particles by biological cells.
The cell is described by the phase field method and the driving mechanisms of
uptake are actin ratcheting, modeled by a dynamic vector field, as well as
cell-particle adhesion due to receptor-ligand binding. We first test the
modeling framework for the symmetric situation of a spherical cell engulfing a
fixed spherical particle. We then exemplify its versatility by studying various
asymmetric situations like different particle shapes and orientations, as well
as the simultaneous uptake of two particles. In addition, we perform a
perturbation theory of a slightly modified model version in the symmetric
setting, allowing to derive a reduced model, shedding light on the effective
driving forces and being easier to solve. This work is meant as a first step in
describing phagocytosis and we discuss several effects that are amenable to
future modeling within the same framework.

Femtosecond pulses have been used to reveal hidden broken symmetry states and
induce transitions to metastable states. However, these states are mostly
transient and disappear after laser removal. Photoinduced phase transitions
towards crystalline metastable states with a change of topological order are
rare and difficult to predict and realize experimentally. Here, by using
constrained density functional perturbation theory and accounting for
light-induced quantum anharmonicity, we show that ultra-fast lasers can
permanently transform the topologically-trivial orthorhombic structure of SnSe
into the topological crystalline insulating rocksalt phase via a first-order
non-thermal phase transition. We describe the reaction path and evaluate the
critical fluence and the possible decay channels after photoexcitation. Our
simulations of the photoexcited structural and vibrational properties are in
excellent agreement with recent pump-probe data in the intermediate fluence
regime below the transition with an error on the curvature of the quantum free
energy of the photoexcited state that is smaller than 2%.

Heat control is a key issue in nano-electronics, where new efficient energy
transfer mechanisms are highly sought after. In this respect, indirect evidence
has indicated that high-mobility hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-encapsulated
graphene exhibits near-field out-of-plane radiative energy transfer when driven
out-of-equilibrium. Here we directly observe near-field radiative energy
transfer in intrinsic graphene devices under large bias. We employ mid-infrared
spectroscopy and pyrometry to demonstrate the out-of-plane energy transfer
mediated by the near-field phonon-polariton modes of the hBN encapsulant. By
using different hBN crystals of varied crystalline quality, we also demonstrate
the ability to engineer the energy transfer efficiency, a valuable asset
towards its use for compact thermal management of electronic circuits.

Directed atomic fabrication using an aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) opens new pathways for atomic
engineering of functional materials. In this approach, the electron beam is
used to actively alter the atomic structure through electron beam induced
irradiation processes. One of the impediments that has limited widespread use
thus far has been the ability to understand the fundamental mechanisms of
atomic transformation pathways at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we
develop a workflow for obtaining and analyzing high-speed spiral scan STEM
data, up to 100 fps, to track the atomic fabrication process during nanopore
milling in monolayer MoS2. An automated feedback-controlled electron beam
positioning system combined with deep convolution neural network (DCNN) was
used to decipher fast but low signal-to-noise datasets and classify
time-resolved atom positions and nature of their evolving atomic defect
configurations. Through this automated decoding, the initial atomic disordering
and reordering processes leading to nanopore formation was able to be studied
across various timescales. Using these experimental workflows a greater degree
of speed and information can be extracted from small datasets without
compromising spatial resolution. This approach can be adapted to other 2D
materials systems to gain further insights into the defect formation necessary
to inform future automated fabrication techniques utilizing the STEM electron

deviates from models developed for all-organic or all-inorganic materials
systems. Here, we reveal the complexity of exciton-phonon interactions in a
recently discovered 2D layered hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductor, silver
phenylselenolate (AgSePh). Using femtosecond resonant impulsive vibrational
spectroscopy and non-resonant Raman scattering, we measure multiple hybrid
organic-inorganic vibrational modes and identify a subset of these modes that
strongly couple to the electronic excited state. Calculations by density
functional perturbation theory show that these strongly coupled modes exhibit
large out-of-plane silver atomic motions and silver-selenium spacing
displacements. Moreover, analysis of photoluminescence fine-structure splitting
and temperature-dependent peak-shifting/linewidth-broadening suggests that
light emission in AgSePh is most strongly affected by a compound 100 cm-1 mode
involving the wagging motion of phenylselenolate ligands and accompanying
metal-chalcogen stretching. Finally, red-shifting of vibrational modes with
increasing temperature reveals a high degree of anharmonicity arising from
non-covalent interactions between phenyl rings. These findings reveal the
unique effects of hybrid vibrational modes in organic-inorganic semiconductors
and motivate future work aimed at specifically engineering such interactions
through chemical and structural modification.

The advent of monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy has enabled
atomic-resolution vibrational spectroscopy, which triggered interest in
spatially localized or quasi-localized vibrational modes in materials. Here we
report the discovery of phonon vortices at heavy impurities in two-dimensional
materials. We use density-functional-theory calculations for two configurations
of Si impurities in graphene, Si-C3 and Si-C4, to examine atom-projected phonon
densities of states and display the atomic-displacement patterns for select
modes that are dominated by impurity displacements. The vortices are driven by
large displacements of the impurities, and reflect local symmetries. Similar
vortices are found at phosphorus impurities in hexagonal boron nitride,
suggesting that they may be a feature of heavy impurities in crystalline
materials. Phonon vortices at defects are expected to play a role in thermal
conductivity and other properties.

The thermoelectric response of thermally activated electrolytes (TAE) in a
slit channel is studied theoretically and by numerical simulations. The term
TAE refers to electrolytes whose charge carrier concentration is a function of
temperature, as recently suggested for ionic liquids and highly concentrated
aqueous electrolyte solutions. Two competing mechanisms driving charge
transport by temperature gradients are identified. For suitable values of the
activation energy that governs the generation of charge carriers, a giant
thermoelectric response is found, which could help explaining recent
experimental results for nanoporous media infiltrated with TAEs.

<h3>Characterizing Floquet topological phases by quench dynamics: A  multiple-subsystem approach</h3>

<br>

We investigate the dynamical characterization theory for periodically driven
systems in which Floquet topology can be fully detected by emergent topological
patterns of quench dynamics in momentum subspaces called band-inversion
surfaces. We improve the results of a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 125},
183001 (2020)] and propose a more flexible scheme to characterize a generic
class of $d$-dimensional Floquet topological phases by applying a quench along
an arbitrary spin-polarization axis. Our basic idea is that by disassembling
the Floquet system into multiple static subsystems that are periodic in
quasienergy, a full characterization of Floquet topological phases reduces to
identifying a series of bulk topological invariants for time-independent
Hamiltonians, which greatly enhances the convenience and flexibility of the
measurement. We illustrate the scheme by numerically analyzing two
experimentally realizable models in two and three dimensions, respectively, and
adopting two different but equivalent viewpoints to examine the dynamical
characterization. Finally, considering the imperfection of experiment, we
demonstrate that the present scheme can also be applied to a general situation
where the initial state is not completely polarized. This study provides an
immediately implementable approach for dynamically classifying Floquet
topological phases in ultracold atoms or other quantum simulators.

Spintronics aims at establishing an information technology relying on the
spins of electrons. Key to this vision is the spin-to-charge conversion (and
vice versa) enabled by spin-orbit coupling, which represents the intimate bond
between spins and charges. Here, we set the foundations to manipulate the
spin-orbit coupling in Rashba systems in a coherent way at THz frequencies
without parasitic electronic dissipation. Our approach relies on the generation
of coherent lattice dynamics in BiTeI. Using ultrashort laser pulses ranging
from the visible to the mid-infrared spectral range we establish quantitatively
the conditions for an effective generation of coherent THz phonons, with the
required symmetry for a manipulation of the Rashba coupling. Furthermore, we
conclude an open discussion on the possibility of photoinducing of a spin
current in BiTeI, proving that this is not the case. We envision a direct
application of our pumping scheme in a photoemission experiment, which can
directly disclose the THz dynamics of the Rashba splitting.

Bound states in the continuum have recently been utilized in photonic crystal
gratings to achieve strong coupling and ultralow power-driven condensation of
bosonic exciton-polariton quasiparticles with atypical Dirac-like features in
their dispersion relation. Here, we develop the single- and many-body theory of
these new effective relativistic exciton-polaritons modes and describe their
mean field condensation dynamics facilitated by the interplay between
protection from the radiative continuum and negative-mass pump induced optical
trapping. Our theory accounts for many tunable grating parameters giving full
control over the diffractive coupling properties between guided polaritons and
the radiative continuum previously unexplored in the context of driven
condensation. In particular, we discover stable cyclical condensate solutions
mimicking a driven-dissipative analog of the zitterbewegung effect
characterized by coherent superposition of both ballistic (rapid phase front)
and trapped (slow phase front) polariton waves. Finally, important distinctions
are drawn between the concepts of near field and far field in the photonic
grating, clarifying recent experimental observations on the emission
characteristics of these long lived nonlinear Dirac polaritons.

<h3>Theory of weak localization in graphene with spin-orbit interaction</h3>

Theory of weak localization in graphene with Rashba splitting of energy
spectrum is developed. Anomalous magnetoresistance caused by weak localization
is calculated with account for inter- and intravalley, spin-orbit and
spin-valley scattering processes. It is shown that the anomalous
magnetoresistance is described by the expression different from the traditional
Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formula. The reason is that the effect of Rashba
splitting gives rise to the spin-orbit vector potential which is not reduced to
a spin dephasing only. The developed theory can be applied to heterostructures
of graphene with transition metal dichalcogenides.

Recently PdTe was identified as a spin-orbit coupled topological Dirac
semimetal and was claimed to exhibit both bulk-nodal and surface-nodeless
superconducting gaps. Here we report the ultralow-temperature thermal
conductivity measurements on PdTe single crystals with $T_c$ = 4.5 K to
investigate its superconducting gap structure. It is found that the residual
linear term $\kappa_0/T$ is negligible in zero magnetic field. Furthermore, the
field dependence of $\kappa_0(H)/T$ exhibits an $\sf S$-shaped curve. These
results suggest that PdTe has multiple nodeless superconducting gaps, which is
at odds with the claimed bulk-nodal gap. The reason for the discrepancy is
likely that previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements
were only performed down to 2 K and cannot observe the smaller nodeless gap.
The fully gapped superconducting state in PdTe is compatible with it being a
topological superconductor candidate.

<h3>Willis elasticity from microcontinuum field theories: Asymptotics,  microstructure-property relationships, and cloaking</h3>

Willis elasticity is an effective medium theory for linearly elastic
composites that incorporates an unusual coupling between stress and velocity,
as well as between momentum and strain. Interest in the theory peaked following
the discovery that its formulation is invariant under curvilinear changes of
coordinates and that, consequently, it can be used to inverse-design
``invisibility'' cloaks for elastodynamics. That said, the
microstructure-property relationships in Willis elasticity are poorly
understood and, in particular, the mechanics that underlie the coupling are
largely unknown. Thus, no such cloaks were constructed.
Here, we put forward the idea that Willis elasticity is a particular
microcontinuum field theory where the (generalized) micro-displacements have
been eliminated in favor of the macroscopic displacement field as if by Schur
completion. The field theory is special in that it features an inertial
coupling between the micro- and macro-displacements that, upon completion,
re-emerges as the coupling term in Willis elasticity. Concretely, we analyze an
asymptotic regime where mechanical lattices exhibit a kinematic enrichment with
a strong (leading-order) inertial coupling. We provide, in closed-form, the
resulting microstructure-property relationships. As an application, and in
light of the gained insights, we design an ``invisibility'' cloak resolved into
Willis-elastic mechanical lattices.

<h3>Topologically protected subdiffusive transport in two-dimensional  fermionic wires</h3>

The conductance at the band edges of one-dimensional fermionic wires, with
$N$ sites, has been shown to have subdiffusive $(1/N^2)$ behavior. We
investigate this issue in two-dimensional fermionic wires described by a
hopping model on an $N_x\times N_y$ rectangular lattice comprised of vertical
chains with a Hermitian intra-chain and inter-chain hopping matrices given by
$H_0$ and $H_1$, respectively. We study particle transport using the
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, and show that the asymptotic
behavior of the conductance, $T(\omega)$, at the Fermi level $\omega$, is
controlled by the spectrum of a dimensionless matrix
$A(\omega)=(-\omega+H_0)H_1^{-1}$. This gives three simple conditions on the
spectrum of $A(\omega)$ for observing ballistic, subdiffusive, and
exponentially decaying $T(\omega)$ with respect to $N_x$. We show that certain
eigenvalues of $A(\omega)$ give rise to subdiffusive contributions in the
conductance, and correspond to the band edges of the isolated wire. We
demonstrate that the condition for observing the subdiffusive behavior can be
satisfied if $A(\omega)$ has nontrivial topology. In that case, a transition
from ballistic behavior to subdiffusive behavior of the conductance is observed
as the hopping parameters are tuned within the topological regime. We argue
that at the transition point, different behaviors of the conductance can arise
as the trivial bulk bands of $A(\omega)$ also contribute subdiffusively. We
illustrate our findings in a simple model by numerically computing the
variation of the conductance with $N_x$. Our numerical results indicate a
different subdiffusive behavior ($1/N_x^3$) of the conductance at the
transition point. We find the numerical results in good agreement with the
theoretical predictions.

<h3>TASEP Exit Times</h3>

We address the question of the time needed by $N$ particles, initially
located on the first sites of a finite 1D lattice of size $L$, to exit that
lattice when they move according to a TASEP transport model. Using analytical
calculations and numerical simulations, we show that when $N \ll L$, the mean
exit time of the particles is asymptotically given by $T_N(L) \sim L+\beta_N
\sqrt{L}$ for large lattices. Building upon exact results obtained for 2
particles, we devise an approximate continuous space and time description of
the random motion of the particles that provides an analytical recursive
relation for the coefficients $\beta_N$. The results are shown to be in very
good agreement with numerical results. This approach sheds some light on the
exit dynamics of $N$ particles in the regime where $N$ is finite while the
lattice size $L\rightarrow \infty$. This complements previous asymptotic
results obtained by Johansson in \cite{Johansson2000} in the limit where both
$N$ and $L$ tend to infinity while keeping the particle density $N/L$ finite.

<h3>Heterogeneous nucleation in the random field Ising model</h3>

We investigate the nucleation dynamics of the three-dimensional random field
Ising model (RFIM) under an external field. We use umbrella sampling to compute
the free-energy cost of a critical nucleus, and use forward flux sampling for
the direct estimation of nucleation rates. For moderate to strong disorder, our
results indicate that the size of the nucleating cluster is not a good reaction
coordinate, contrary to the pure Ising model. We rectify this problem by
introducing a coordinate that also accounts for the location of the nucleus.
Using the free energy barrier to predict the nucleation rate, we find
reasonable agreement, although deviations become stronger as disorder
increases. We attribute this effect to cluster shape fluctuations. We also
discuss finite-size effects on the nucleation rate.

<h3>Abelian Higgs gauge theories with multicomponent scalar fields and  multiparameter scalar potentials</h3>

<i>Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider multicomponent Abelian Higgs (AH) gauge theories with
multiparameter scalar quartic potentials that are extensions, with a smaller
global symmetry group, of $SU(N)$-invariant AH theories. In particular, we
consider an AH model with a two-parameter scalar potential and $SO(N)$ global
symmetry. We discuss the renormalization-group flow of the $SO(N)$-invariant AH
field theory and the phase diagram and critical behavior of a corresponding
three-dimensional (3D) noncompact lattice AH model. We argue that the phase
diagram of 3D noncompact $SO(N)$- and $SU(N)$-symmetric lattice AH models are
qualitatively similar. In both cases there are three phases: the
high-temperature Coulomb phase, and the low-temperature molecular and Higgs
phases that differ for the topological properties of the gauge correlations.
However, the main features of the low-temperature ordered phases, and in
particular of the Higgs phase, differ significantly in $SO(N)$ and $SU(N)$
models. In particular, in $SO(N)$ models they depend on the sign of the
self-interaction parameter $v$ that controls the symmetry breaking from $SU(N)$
to $SO(N)$. As a consequence, also the universal features of the transitions
related with the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry (those between the
high-temperature Coulomb phase and the low-temperature molecular and Higgs
phases) depend on the sign of $v$.

We find a closed-form expression for the Poisson's coefficient of
curved-crease variants of the ``Miura ori'' origami tessellation. This is done
by explicitly constructing a continuous one-parameter family of isometric
piecewise-smooth surfaces that describes the action of folding out of a
reference state. The response of the tessellations in bending is investigated
as well: \comment{using a numerical convergence scheme,} the effective normal
curvatures under infinitesimal bending are found to occur in a ratio equal and
opposite to the Poisson's coefficient. These results are the first of their
kind and, by their simplicity, should provide a fruitful benchmark for the
design and modeling of curved-crease origami and compliant shell mechanisms.
Here, the developed methods are used to design a curved crease 3D morphing
solid with a tunable self-locked state.

We study the dispersion properties of electron plasma waves, or plasmons,
which can be excited in quantum plasmas in the nonlinear regime. In order to
describe nonlinear electron response to finite amplitude plasmons, we apply the
Volkov approach to non-relativistic electrons. For that purpose, we use the
Schr\"odinger equation and describe the electron population of a quantum plasma
as a mixture of quantum states. Within the kinetic framework that we are able
to derive from the Volkov solutions, we discuss the role of the wave amplitude
on the nonlinear plasma response. Finally, we focus on the quantum properties
of nonlinear Landau damping and study the contributions of multi-plasmon
absorption and emission processes.

The screening of an impurity spin in the Kondo model occurs over a
characteristic length scale $\xi_K$, that defines the size of the Kondo
screening cloud or ``mist". The presence of such a length sc A consistent way
to show the presence of the screening cloud is to demonstrate scaling in the
spatial correlations depending on $r$, in terms of the single variable
$r/\xi_K$ rather than depending on $r$ and $\xi_K$ separately. Here we study
the paradigmatic one channel Kondo model using a spin chain representation,
with an impurity spin at one end of the chain coupled with a strength $J_K'$.
Using Fermi liquid theory combined with numerical results, we obtain new high
precision estimates of the non-universal terms in the entanglement entropy
which leads to a verification of the expected non-integer ground-state
degeneracy, $g$. This then allows us to study the impurity contribution to the
entanglement in detail. If the impurity coupling $J_K'$ is varied, a precise
determination of $\xi_K$ can then be obtained. The length scale, $\xi_K$, is
then shown to characterize the scaling of both the uniform and alternating part
of a measure of the magnetization of part of an odd length chain with.

We study the nonlinear $\sigma$-model in ${(d+1)}$-dimensional spacetime with
connected target space $K$ and show that, at energy scales below singularities
(e.g., vortices, hedgehogs, etc.), it has an emergent non-invertible higher
symmetry. The symmetry defects of the emergent symmetry are described by the
$d$-representations of a discrete $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$, so the emergent
symmetry is the dual of the invertible $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ symmetry.
The $d$-group $\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is determined such that its classifying space
$B\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is given by the $d$-th Postnikov stage of $K$. In $(2+1)$D
for finite $\mathbb{G}^{(2)}$, this symmetry is always holo-equivalent to an
invertible ${0}$-form $\unicode{x2013}$ ordinary $\unicode{x2013}$ symmetry
with potential 't Hooft anomaly. The singularity-free disordered phase of the
nonlinear $\sigma$-model spontaneously breaks this symmetry, and when
$\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ is finite, it is described by the deconfined phase of
$\mathbb{G}^{(d)}$ higher gauge theory. We consider examples of such disordered
phases. We focus on a singularity-free $S^2$ nonlinear $\sigma$-model in
${(3+1)}$D and show that its disordered phase is described by axion
electrodynamics and has two gapless modes corresponding to a photon and a
massless axion. This result is obtained via its emergent symmetry, which is the
dual of a $\mathbb{G}^{(3)}$ symmetry. Its classifying space
$B\mathbb{G}^{(3)}$ satisfies $\pi_1(B\mathbb{G}^{(3)})=0$,
$\pi_2(B\mathbb{G}^{(3)})=\mathbb{Z}$, $\pi_3(B\mathbb{G}^{(3)})=\mathbb{Z}$,
and has a nontrivial Postnikov invariant that describes the interplay between
$\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$. This means that the emergent symmetry is an exotic
continuous non-invertible symmetry in ${(3+1)}$D, while just an ordinary $U(1)$
invertible ${0}$-form symmetry in ${(2+1)}$D.

One of the most pronounced non-Hermitian phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin
effect, which refers to the exponential localization of bulk eigenstates near
the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems. Whereas non-Bloch band theory has been
developed to describe the non-Hermitian skin effect in lattice systems, its
counterpart in continuum systems still lacks a quantitative characterization.
Here, we generalize the non-Bloch band theory to non-Hermitian continuum
systems. In contrast to lattice systems for which the bulk Hamiltonian alone
determines the non-Hermitian skin effect and energy spectrum, we find for
continuum systems that the number of boundary conditions must also be included
as essential information. We show that the appropriate discretization of
continuum systems into lattice models requires matching the hopping range of
the latter to the number of boundary conditions in the former. Furthermore, in
periodic non-Hermitian continuum systems, we highlight the application of the
transfer matrix in determining the generalized Brillouin zone. Our theory
serves as a useful toolbox for investigating the rich non-Bloch physics in
non-Hermitian continuum systems, such as photonic crystals, elastic media, and
certain cold-atom systems.

Numerically simulating spinful, fermionic systems is of great interest from
the perspective of condensed matter physics. However, the exponential growth of
the Hilbert space dimension with system size renders an exact parameterization
of large quantum systems prohibitively demanding. This is a perfect playground
for neural networks, owing to their immense representative power that often
allows to use only a fraction of the parameters that are needed in exact
methods. Here, we investigate the ability of neural quantum states (NQS) to
represent the bosonic and fermionic $t-J$ model - the high interaction limit of
the Fermi-Hubbard model - on different 1D and 2D lattices. Using autoregressive
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with 2D tensorized gated recurrent units, we
study the ground state representations upon doping the half-filled system with
holes. Moreover, we present a method to calculate dispersion relations from the
neural network state representation, applicable to any neural network
architecture and any lattice geometry, that allows to infer the low-energy
physics from the NQS. To demonstrate our approach, we calculate the dispersion
of a single hole in the $t-J$ model on different 1D and 2D square and
triangular lattices. Furthermore, we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of
the RNN approach for fermionic systems, pointing the way for an accurate and
efficient parameterization of fermionic quantum systems using neural quantum
states.
