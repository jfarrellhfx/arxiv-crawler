<h3>Microrollers Flow Uphill as Granular Media</h3>

Pour sand into a container and only the grains near the top surface move. The
collective motion associated with the translational and rotational energy of
the grains in a thin flowing layer is quickly dissipated as friction through
multibody interactions. Alternatively, consider what would happen to a bed of
particles if one applies a torque to each individual particle. In this paper,
we demonstrate an experimental system where torque and friction is
independently applied at the constituent level through a rotating magnetic
field in a dense bed of microrollers. The net result is the grains roll uphill,
forming a heap with a negative angle of repose. Velocimetry of the flowing
layer reveals the collective motion of these responsive particles scales in a
similar way to flowing bulk granular flows. In contrast to the response of
active or responsive particles that mimic thermodynamic principles, this system
results in macroscopic collective behavior that behaves as the inverse bulk
rheology and kinematics of a purely dissipative granular system.

<h3>Squigglebot: a battery powered spherical rolling robot as a model active  matter system to measure its energetics</h3>

Active matter systems use their internal or ambient source of energy and
dissipate them at the scale of individual constituent particles to generate
motion. Direct measurement of the energy influx for individual particles has
not been achieved in the experiments. Here we present "Squigglebot" - a battery
powered spherical rolling robot based on open source hardware as an artificial
active matter system whose energy consumption as well as the energy dissipation
into different modes of motion both can be measured experimentally. This can
serve as a prototype system to study a number of interesting problems in
non-equilibrium statistical physics, where details of the energetics are
required.

<h3>Catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium:  Configuring a cooperative mechanism at the Ag-Ag$_2$S-MoS$_2$ interface</h3>

<br>
Designing electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline conditions to overcome the
sluggish kinetics associated with the additional water dissociation step is a
recognized challenge in promoting the hydrogen economy. To this end, delicately
tuning the atomic-scale structure and surface composition of nanoparticles is a
common strategy and, specifically, making use of hybrid structures, can produce
synergistic effects that lead to highly active catalysts. Here, we present a
core-shell catalyst of Ag@MoS$_2$ that shows promising results towards the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M KOH. In this
hybrid structure, the MoS$_2$ shell is strained and defective, and charge
transfer occurs between the conductive core and the shell, contributing to the
electrocatalytic activity. The shelling process results in a large fraction of
Ag$_2$S in the cores, and adjusting the relative fractions of Ag, Ag$_2$S, and
MoS$_2$ leads to improved catalytic activity and fast charge-transfer kinetics.
We suggest that the enhancement of alkaline HER is associated with a
cooperative effect of the interfaces, where the Ag(I) sites in Ag$_2$S drive
the water dissociation step, and the formed hydrogen subsequently recombines on
the defective MoS$_2$ shell. This study demonstrates the benefits of hybrid
structures as functional nanomaterials and provides a scheme to activate
MoS$_2$ for HER in alkaline conditions.

<h3>Flow network controlled shape transformation of a thin membrane through  differential fluid storage and surface expansion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04575</a>

<br>
The mechanical properties of a thin, planar material, perfused by an embedded
flow network, can be changed locally and globally by the fluid transport and
storage, resulting in small or large-scale deformation, such as out-of-plane
buckling. Fluid absorption and storage eventually cause the material to locally
swell. Different parts can hydrate and swell unevenly, prompting a differential
expansion of the surface. In order to computationally study the hydraulically
induced differential swelling and buckling of such a membrane, we develop a
network model that describes both the membrane shape and fluid movement,
coupling mechanics with hydrodynamics. We simulate the time-dependent fluid
distribution in the flow network based on a spatially explicit resistor network
model with local fluid-storage capacitance. The shape of the surface is modeled
by a spring network produced by a tethered mesh discretization, in which local
bond rest lengths are adjusted instantaneously according to associated local
fluid content in the capacitors in a quasi-static way. We investigate the
effects of various designs of the flow network, including overall hydraulic
traits (resistance and capacitance) and hierarchical architecture (arrangement
of major and minor veins), on the specific dynamics of membrane shape
transformation. To quantify these effects, we explore the correlation between
local Gaussian curvature and relative stored fluid content in each hierarchy by
using linear regression, which reveals that stronger correlations could be
induced by less densely connected major veins. This flow-controlled mechanism
of shape transformation was inspired by the blooming of flowers through the
unfolding of petals. It can potentially offer insights for other reversible
motions observed in plants induced by differential turgor and water transport
through the xylem vessels, as well as engineering applications.

<h3>Dynamics of equilibrium linked colloidal gels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04580" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04580</a>
<br>
<i>Taejin Kwon, Tanner A. Wilcoxson, Delia J. Milliron, Thomas M. Truskett</i>
<br>
Colloids that attractively bond to only a few neighbors (e.g., patchy
particles) can form equilibrium gels with distinctive dynamic properties that
are stable in time. Here, we use a coarse-grained model to explore the dynamics
of linked networks of patchy colloids whose average valence is macroscopically,
rather than microscopically, constrained. Simulation results for the model show
dynamic hallmarks of equilibrium gel formation and establish that the
colloid-colloid bond persistence time controls the characteristic slow
relaxation of the self-intermediate scattering function. The model features
re-entrant network formation without phase separation as a function of linker
concentration, centered at the stoichiometric ratio of linker ends to
nanoparticle surface bonding sites. Departures from stoichiometry result in
linker-starved or site-starved networks with reduced connectivity and shorter
characteristic relaxation times with lower activation energies. Underlying the
re-entrant trends, dynamic properties vary monotonically with the number of
effective network bonds per colloid, a quantity that can be predicted using
Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory. These behaviors suggest
macroscopic in situ strategies for tuning the dynamical response of colloidal
networks.

<h3>Clustering and finite size effects in a two-species exclusion process</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04633</a>
<br>
<i>Jim Chacko, Sudipto Muhuri, Goutam Tripathy</i>
<br>
We study the cluster size distribution of particles for a two-species
exclusion process which involves totally asymmetric transport process of two
oppositely directed species with stochastic directional switching of the
species on a 1D lattice. As a function of $Q$ - the ratio of the translation
rate and directional switching rate of particles, in the limit of $Q
\rightarrow 0$, the probability distribution of the cluster size is an
exponentially decaying function of cluster size $m$ and is exactly similar to
the cluster size distribution of a TASEP. For $Q>>1$, the model can be mapped
to persistent exclusion process (PEP) and the average cluster size, $\langle m
\rangle \propto Q^{1/2} $. We obtain an approximate expression for the average
cluster size in this limit. For finite system size system of $L$ lattice sites,
for a particle number density $\rho$, the probability distribution of cluster
sizes exhibits a distinct peak which corresponds to the formation of a single
cluster of size $m_s = \rho L$. However this peak vanishes in the thermodynamic
limit $ L \rightarrow \infty$. Interestingly, the probability of this largest
size cluster, $P(m_s)$, exhibits scaling behaviour such that in terms of scaled
variable $Q_1 \equiv Q/L^2 \rho(1-\rho)$, data collapse is observed for the
probability of this cluster. The statistical features related to clustering
observed for this minimal model may also be relevant for understanding
clustering characteristics in {\it active } particles systems in confined 1D
geometry.

<h3>Mechanical and geometrical properties of jammed wet granular materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04709</a>
<br>
<i>Kiwamu Yoshii, Michio Otsuki</i>
<br>
We numerically investigate the mechanical and geometrical properties of dense
wet granular particles with irreversible attractive interaction. The shear
modulus exhibits two inflection points as the packing fraction increases, and
the bulk modulus shows a non-monotonic behavior. The coordination number also
exhibits two inflection points. The peak position in the pair correlation
function shifts to a lower value due to attractive interaction. The Voronoi
tessellation of the particle configuration reveals that the probability density
function for the volume of the Voronoi cell broadens as the packing fraction
approaches the jamming point.

<h3>Activity-induced droplet propulsion and multifractality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04864" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04864</a>
<br>
<i>Nadia Bihari Padhan, Rahul Pandit</i>
<br>
We develop a minimal hydrodynamic model, without an orientational order
parameter, for assemblies of contractile swimmers encapsulated in a droplet of
a binary-fluid emulsion. Our model uses two coupled scalar order parameters,
$\phi$ and $\psi$, which capture, respectively, the droplet interface and the
activity of the contractile swimmers inside this droplet. These order
parameters are also coupled to the velocity field $\bm u$. At low activity, our
model yields a self-propelling droplet whose center of mass $(CM)$ displays
rectilinear motion, powered by the spatiotemporal evolution of the field
$\psi$, which leads to a time-dependent vortex dipole at one end of the
droplet. As we increase the activity, this $CM$ shows chaotic super-diffusive
motion, which we characterize by its mean-square displacement; and the droplet
interface exhibits multifractal fluctuations, whose spectrum of exponents we
calculate. We explore the implications of our results for experiments on active
droplets of contractile swimmers.

<h3>Two-dimensional Janus Si dichalcogenides: A first-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05027" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05027</a>
<br>

<br>
Strong structural asymmetry is actively explored in two-dimensional (2D)
materials, because it can give rise to many interesting physical properties.
Motivated by the recent synthesis of monolayer $\mathrm{Si_2Te_2}$, we explore
a family of 2D materials, termed as the Janus Si dichalcogenides (JSD), which
parallel the Janus transition metal dichalcogenides and exhibit even stronger
inversion asymmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate
excellent stability of these materials. We show that their strong structural
asymmetry leads to pronounced intrinsic polar field, sizable spin splitting due
to spin-orbit coupling, and large piezoelectric response. The spin splitting
involves an out-of-plane component, which is beyond the linear Rashba model.
The piezoelectric tensor has large value in both in-plane $d_{11}$ coefficient
and out-of-plane $d_{31}$ coefficient, making the monolayer JSDs distinct among
the existing 2D piezoelectrics. In addition, we find interesting strain-induced
phase transitions in these materials. Particularly, there are multiple valleys
in the conduction band that compete for the conduction band minimum, which will
lead to notable changes in optical and transport properties under strain. Our
work reveals a new family of Si based 2D materials, which could find promising
applications in spintronic and piezoelectric devices.

<h3>Interface roughening in nonequilibrium phase-separated systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05096" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05096</a>
<br>
<i>Marc Besse, Giordano Fausti, Michael E. Cates, Bertrand Delamotte, Cesare Nardini</i>
<br>
Interfaces of phase-separated systems roughen in time due to capillary waves.
Due to fluxes in the bulk, their dynamics is nonlocal in real space and is not
described by the Edwards-Wilkinson or Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equations, nor their
conserved counterparts. We show that in the absence of detailed balance, the
phase-separated interface is described by a new universality class that we term
|q|KPZ. We compute the associated critical exponents via one-loop
renormalization group, and corroborate the results by numerical integration of
the |q|KPZ equation. Deriving the effective interface dynamics from a minimal
field theory of active phase separation, we finally argue that the |q|KPZ
universality class generically describes liquid-vapor interfaces in active
systems.

<h3>Cluster formation and the link to viscosity in antibody solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05182</a>
<br>

<br>
Monoclonal antibody solutions are set to become a major therapeutic tool in
the years to come, capable of targeting various diseases by clever designing
their antigen binding site. However, the formulation of stable solutions
suitable for patient self-administration typically presents challenges, as a
result of the increase in viscosity that often occurs at high concentrations.
Here, we establish a link between the microscopic molecular details and the
resulting properties of an antibody solution through the characterization of
clusters, which arise in the presence of self-associating antibodies. In
particular, we find that experimental small-angle X-ray scattering data can be
interpreted by means of analytical models previously exploited for the study of
polymeric and colloidal objects, based on the presence of such clusters. The
latter are determined by theoretical calculations and computer simulations of a
coarse-grained minimal model, in which antibodies are treated as Y-shaped
colloidal molecules and attractive domains are designed as patches. Using the
predicted cluster size distributions, we are able to determine how the
concentration-dependent increase in viscosity is indeed originated by the
presence of small and medium-sized clusters. Our findings provide new insights
on the aggregation of monoclonal antibodies, which can be exploited for guiding
the formulation of stable and effective antibody solutions.

<h3>Dynamic path dependence of phase behaviors in dense active system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05362</a>
<br>
<i>Lu Chen, Bokai Zhang, Z.C.Tu</i>
<br>
There are rich emergent phase behaviors in nonequilibrium active systems.
Flocking and clustering are two representative dynamic phases. Their
complementary shapes in phase diagrams suggest some subtle relationships, which
are still an open problem. By numerical simulation of self-propelled particles
with active reorientation, we investigate the time evolution of order
parameters under different initial states. This work reveals that the
steady-state phase behaviors are strongly dependent on dynamic historical path.
The distributions of order parameters of flocking and clustering in the
long-time steady states show bi-stable state. The existence of these bi-stable
states is due to the change of dynamic paths arising from different initial
states. Accordingly, we propose a method to eliminate the bi-stable state by
controlling the ordering of the initial state. By increasing (decrease) the

We analyse pattern formation in systems of active particles with right/left
asymmetry of the interaction forces in the context of pedestrian dynamics. To
describe the inter-particle interactions we utilize the standard social force
model and supplement it with the new type of force, reflecting the chirality of
pedestrians. We perform numerical simulations of two pedestrian flows moving in
opposite directions in a long corridor and observe, as in previous studies, a
phase transition from a disordered motion to multi-lane motion. Additionally,
we observe a novel phase transition, from the multi-lane to two-lane motion,
which occurs with varying density and strength of the chirality force. We
perform a qualitative analysis to predict the critical density of the first and
second transition, and its dependence on the chirality. The results of our
analysis agree fairly well with the simulation data. Our findings may find
applications in urbanistic and transport problems.

The two-dimensional materials are an exciting platform for various types of
studies because of their tunability and versatility. However, creating devices
from such materials is cumbersome. One of the burden is searching for images of
candidate crystals from exfoliated bunch that vary in shapes and sizes. We
propose the methods to accurately search for desired crystals by combining
reinforcement learning and object detection. Our method utilizes the unique
image settings of exfoliated crystals to reduce the computation power. The
proposed method showed enhancement in performance compared to the baseline.
Finally, we quantify the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning agent in
searching. Codes are available at

<h3>Vortex Fermi Liquid and Strongly Correlated Bad Metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04472</a>
<br>
<i>Nayan Myerson-Jain, Chao-Ming Jian, Cenke Xu</i>
<br>
The semiclassical description of two-dimensional ($2d$) metals based on the
quasiparticle picture suggests that there is a universal threshold of the
resistivity: the resistivity of a $2d$ metal is bounded by the so called
Mott-Ioffe-Regal (MIR) limit, which is at the order of $h/e^2$. If a system
remains metallic while its resistivity is beyond the MIR limit, it is referred
to as a "bad metal", which challenges our theoretical understanding as the very
notion of quasiparticles is invalidated. The description of the system becomes
even more challenging when there is also strong correlation between the
electrons. Partly motivated by the recent experiment on transition metal
dichalcogenides moir\'{e} heterostructure, we seek for understanding of
strongly correlated bad metals whose resistivity far exceeds the MIR limit. For
some strongly correlated bad metals, though a microscopic description based on
electron quasiparticles fails, a trackable dual description based on the
"vortex of charge" is still possible. We construct a concrete example of such
strongly correlated bad metals where vortices are fermions with a Fermi
surface, and we demonstrate that its resistivity can be exceptionally large at
zero temperature. And when extra charge $\delta n_e$ is doped into the system
away from half-filling, a small Drude weight proportional to $(\delta n_e)^2$
will emerge in the optical conductivity .

<br>
The Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) model is a classical model for magnetic hysteresis
of single-domain particles. For two-dimensional magnets at finite temperature,
the SW model must be extended to include intrinsic strong spin fluctuations. We
predict several fundamentally different hysteresis properties between 2D and 3D
magnets. The magnetization switching diagram known as the Asteroid figure in
the conventional SW model becomes highly temperature dependent and asymmetric
with respect to the transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields. Our results
provide new insights for 2D magnetic materials based spintronics applications.

<h3>Magnetization dynamics and reversal of two-dimensional magnets</h3>

<i>Essa M. Ibrahim, Shufeng Zhang</i>
<br>
Micromagnetics simulation based on the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) equation has long been a powerful method for modeling magnetization
dynamics and reversal of three-dimensional (3D) magnets. For two-dimensional
(2D) magnets, the magnetization reversal always accompanies the collapse of the
magnetization even at low temperatures due to intrinsic strong spin
fluctuation. We propose a micromagnetic theory that explicitly takes into
account the rapid demagnetization and remagnetization dynamics of 2D magnets
during magnetization reversal. We apply the theory to a single-domain magnet to
illustrate fundamental differences in magnetization trajectories and reversal
times for 2D and 3D magnets.

<br>
The infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS), a type of tensor
network (TN) state, has been used successfully for simulating and
characterizing non-chiral spin liquids on the kagome lattice. Here, we
demonstrate that iPESS also provides a faithful representation of a chiral spin
liquid (CSL) on the same lattice, namely the ground state of the spin-$1/2$
kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a scalar chirality. By classifying local
tensors according to SU$(2)$ and point group symmetries, we construct a chiral
ansatz breaking reflection $P$ and time reversal $T$ symmetries while
preserving $PT$. The variational TN states are shown to host, for bond
dimension $D\ge 8$, a chiral gapless entanglement spectrum following SU$(2)_1$
conformal field theory. The correlation function shows a small weight
long-range tail complying with the prediction of the TN bulk-edge
correspondence. Lastly, we discuss the transition from the non-chiral spin
liquid to the CSL induced by the scalar chirality term.

<h3>Tuning the Topology of a Two-Dimensional Catenated DNA Network</h3>

Molecular topology of polymers plays a key role in determining their physical
properties. We studied herein the topological effects on the static and dynamic
properties of a 2D catenated network of DNA rings called a kinetoplast.
Restriction enzymes, that cleave DNA at sequence-specific sites, are used to
selectively cut and remove rings from the network and hence tune the molecular
topology while maintaining overall structural integrity. We find that topology
has minimal effects over the spatial extension of the 2D network, however, it
significantly affects the relaxation behavior. The shape fluctuations of the
network are governed by two distinct characteristic time scales attributed to
the thermal fluctuations and confinement of the network. The relationship
between the time constant of thermal relaxation and the amplitude of anisotropy
fluctuations yields a universal scaling. Interestingly, this scaling is
independent of the detailed arrangements of rings and/or perforation within the
catenated networks. This study provides a route to tune the elastic properties
of 2D catenated DNA networks by modifying the underlying topology in a rational
and highly controllable manner.

A series of experiments were conducted using the STM instrument, which
involves a conducting tip probe to analyse sample surfaces by measurements of a
tunnelling current. In this experiment, STM was used to (1) determine the
lattice constant of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) by acquiring
atomic resolution images of its surface, (2) measure the work functions of gold
(Au) and HOPG samples using the STS mode and, (3) compare the variation of the
Local Density of States (LDOS) of gold, graphite and Silicon (Si) samples with
respect to bias voltage V. Experimental values of the lattice constant of HOPG
and work functions for gold and graphite were determined as 0.27 +/- 0.2 nm,
0.7 +/- 0.1 eV and 0.5 +/- 0.1 eV respectively. The lattice constant deviated
slightly from the literature value of 0.246 nm, whereas the work functions
deviated significantly from the literature values of 5.40 eV for gold and 4.62
eV for graphite. The LDOS for gold was found to be the highest, followed by
graphite, then silicon. These findings will be discussed.

<h3>Magnetic impurities in a charge-ordered background</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04498" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04498</a>
<br>
<i>Sebastião dos Anjos Sousa-Júnior, Raimundo R. dos Santos, Natanael C. Costa</i>
<br>
We investigate how magnetic impurities may affect a system exhibiting
charge-density wave (CDW) in its ground state. We consider a disordered
Hubbard-Holstein model with a homogeneous electron-phonon interaction, but with
a (randomly chosen) fraction of sites displaying a non-zero Coulomb repulsion,
$U$, and perform state-of-the-art finite-temperature quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. For a single magnetic impurity, charge-charge correlations hamper
the spin-spin ones around the repulsive site, thus requiring a strong enough
value of $U$ to create non-negligible antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations. As
the number of magnetic impurities increases, these AFM correlations become
deleterious to CDW order and its features. First, the critical temperature is
drastically reduced, and seems to vanish around 40$\%$ of impurities (for fixed
$U/\lambda=2$), which we correlate with the classical percolation threshold. We
also notice that just a small amount of disorder suffices to create a
\textit{bad insulating} state, with the suppression of both Peierls and spin
gaps, even within the charge-ordered phase. Finally, we have also found that
pairing correlations are enhanced at large doping, driven by the competition
between CDW and AFM tendencies.

<h3>Control of magnetic states and spin interactions in bilayer CrCl$_{3}$  with strain and electric fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04527</a>
<br>
<i>Ali Ebrahimian, Anna Dyrdał, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</i>
<br>
Using ab initio density functional theory (DFT), we demonstrated the
possibility of controlling the magnetic ground-state properties of bilayer
CrCl$_{3}$ by means of mechanical strains and electric fields. In principle, we
investigated the influence of these two fields on parameters describing the
spin Hamiltonian of the system. The obtained results show that biaxial strains
change the magnetic ground state between ferromagnetic (FM) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM). The mechanical strain also affects the direction and
amplitude of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (MAE). Importantly, the direction
and amplitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors are also
highly tunable under external strain and electric fields. The competition
between nearest neighbor interaction, MAE, and DMI can lead to the
stabilization of various exotic spin textures and novel magnetic excitations.
The high tunability of magnetic properties by external fields makes bilayer
CrCl$_{3}$ a promising candidate for application in the emerging field of
two-dimensional quantum spintronics and magnonics.

<h3>Low-temperature electron mobility in doped semiconductors with high  dielectric constant</h3>

We propose and study theoretically a new mechanism of electron-impurity
scattering in doped seminconductors with large dielectric constant. It is based
upon the idea of \textit{vector} character of deformations caused in the
crystalline lattice by any point defects siting asymmetrically in the unit
cell. In result, local lattice compression due to the elastic deformations
decay as $1/r^2$ with distance from impurity. Electron scattering (due to
standard deformation potential) on such defects leads to low-temperature
mobility $\mu(n)$ scaling with electron density $n$ of the form $\mu(n) \propto
n^{-2/3}$ that is close to experimental observations on a number of relevant
materials.

<h3>Thermodynamic-Dynamic Interrelations in Glass-Forming Polymer Fluids</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaolei Xu, Jack F. Douglas, Wen-Sheng Xu</i>
<br>
We utilize the lattice cluster theory (LCT) of polymer fluids to show that
the configurational entropy, enthalpy, and internal energy are all closely
interrelated, as suggested by recent measurements by Caruthers and Medvedev, so
that the generalized entropy theory (GET) of glass formation, a combination of
the LCT and Adam-Gibbs model, can be recast in terms of any of these
thermodynamic properties as a matter of convenience. Thermodynamic scaling, a
form of density-temperature scaling exhibited by dynamic and some thermodynamic
properties, is used to assess which thermodynamic properties are most naturally
linked to dynamics, and we explore the origin of this scaling by both direct
calculations based on the GET and molecular dynamics simulations of a
coarse-grained polymer model. Through a combination of our comprehensive
modeling of thermodynamic properties using the LCT and the highly predictive
GET model for how the fluid thermodynamics relate to its dynamics, along with
simulation results confirming these theoretical frameworks, we obtain insights
into thermodynamic aspects of collective motion and the slow $\beta$-relaxation
processes of glass-forming liquids.

<h3>Persistent entanglement of valley exciton qubits in transition metal  dichalcogenides integrated into a bimodal optical cavity</h3>

<br>
We report dissipative dynamics of two valley excitons residing in the $K$ and
$K^\prime$-valleys of bare WSe$_2$ monolayer and the one being integrated into
a bimodal optical cavity. In the former, only when the exciton-field detunings
in the $K$ and $K^\prime$-valleys are rigorously equal (resonant detuning),
partially entangled stationary states can be created. Otherwise the concurrence
of exciton qubits turns to zero. Remarkably, in the latter (the WSe$_2$
monolayer in a bimodal optical cavity), the transfers of entanglement from one
subsystem (exciton/light) to the other (light/exciton) take place. Hence a
finite stationary concurrence of exciton qubits is always generated,
independent of whether the exciton-field detuning in two valleys is resonant or
non-resonant. In addition, it can even reach as high as 1 (maximally entangled
state of two valley excitons). Since there no real system which has a strictly
resonant detuning, an immersion of the WSe$_2$ monolayer in a bimodal optical
cavity provides an opportunity to overcome the challenge facing by the bare
WSe$_2$, opening a novel realm of potential qubits.

<br>
The magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional van der Waals magnet
Fe$_{5-\delta}$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT), which has a high ferromagnetic ordering
temperature $T_{\text{C}}$ $\sim$ 315 K, remains to be better understood. It
has been demonstrated that the magnetization of F5GT is sensitive to both the
Fe deficiency ${\delta}$ and the thermal cycling history. Here, we investigate
the structural and magnetic properties of F5GT with a minimal Fe deficiency
($|{\delta}|$ $\le$ 0.1), utilizing combined x-ray and neutron scattering
techniques. Our study reveals that the quenched F5GT single crystals experience
an irreversible, first-order transition at $T_{\text{S}}$ $\sim$ 110 K upon
first cooling, where the stacking order partly or entirely converts from
ABC-stacking to AA-stacking order. Importantly, the magnetic properties,
including the magnetic moment direction and the enhanced $T_{\text{C}}$ after
the thermal cycling, are intimately related to the alteration of the stacking
order. Our work highlights the significant influence of the lattice symmetry to
the magnetism in F5GT.

<h3>Strong-Weak Duality via Jordan-Wigner Transformation: Using Fermionic  Methods for Strongly Correlated $su(2)$ Spin Systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Thomas M. Henderson, Guo P. Chen, Gustavo E. Scuseria</i>
<br>
The Jordan-Wigner transformation establishes a duality between $su(2)$ and
fermionic algebras. We present qualitative arguments and numerical evidence
that when mapping spins to fermions, the transformation makes strong
correlation weaker, as demonstrated by the Hartree-Fock approximation to the
transformed Hamiltonian. This result can be rationalized in terms of rank
reduction of spin shift terms when transformed to fermions. Conversely, the
mapping of fermions to qubits makes strong correlation stronger, complicating
its solution when one uses qubit-based correlators. The presence of string
operators poses challenges to the implementation of quantum chemistry methods
on classical computers, but these can be dealt with using established
techniques of low computational cost. Our proof of principle results for XXZ
and J$_1$-J$_2$ Heisenberg (in 1D and 2D) indicate that the JW transformed
fermionic Hamiltonian has reduced complexity in key regions of their phase
diagrams, and provides a better starting point for addressing challenging spin
problems.

<br>
Quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a disordered state of quantum-mechanically
entangled spins commonly arising from frustrated magnetic dipolar interactions.
However, QSL in some pyrochlore magnets can also come from frustrated magnetic
octupolar interactions. Although the key signature for both dipolar and
octupolar interaction-driven QSL is the presence of a spin excitation continuum
(spinons) arising from the spin quantum number fractionalization, an external
magnetic field-induced ferromagnetic order will transform the spinons into
conventional spin waves in a dipolar QSL. By contrast, in an octupole QSL, the
spin waves carry octupole moments that do not couple, in the leading order, to
the external magnetic field or to neutron moments but will contribute to the
field dependence of the heat capacity. Here we use neutron scattering to show
that the application of a large external magnetic field to Ce2Zr2O7, an
octupolar QSL candidate, induces an Anderson-Higgs transition by condensing the
spinons into a static ferromagnetic ordered state with octupolar spin waves
invisible to neutrons but contributing to the heat capacity. Our theoretical
calculations also provide a microscopic, qualitative understanding for the
presence of octupole scattering at large wavevectors in Ce2Sn2O7 pyrochlore,
and its absence in Ce2Zr2O7. Therefore, our results identify Ce2Zr2O7 as a
strong candidate for an octupolar U (1) QSL, establishing that frustrated
magnetic octupolar interactions are responsible for QSL properties in Ce-based
pyrochlore magnets.

<br>
The pair density wave (PDW) is an extraordinary superconducting state where
Cooper pairs carry nonzero momentum. It can emerge when the full condensation
of zero momentum Cooper pairs is frustrated. Evidence for the existence of
intrinsic PDW order in high-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductors and
kagome superconductors has emerged recently. However, the PDW order in
iron-based high-Tc superconductors has not been observed experimentally. Here,
using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the discovery of
the PDW state in monolayer iron-based high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films grown on
SrTiO3(001) substrates. The PDW state with a period of {\lambda}~3.6a_Fe (a_Fe
is the distance between neighboring Fe atoms) is observed at the domain walls
by the spatial electronic modulations of the local density of states,
superconducting gap, and the {\pi}-phase shift boundaries of the PDW around the
dislocations of the intertwined charge density wave order. The discovery of the
PDW state in the monolayer Fe(Te,Se) film provides a low-dimensional platform
to study the interplay between the correlated electronic states and
unconventional Cooper pairing in high-Tc superconductors.

<h3>Self-Consistent Computation of Spin Torques and Magneto-Resistance in  Tunnel Junctions and Magnetic Read-Heads with Metallic Pinhole Defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04613" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04613</a>
<br>
<i>Serban Lepadatu, Alexey Dobrynin</i>
<br>
A three-dimensional self-consistent spin transport model is developed, which
includes both tunnelling transport, as well as metallic transport. Using the
spin accumulation computed either side of a tunnel barrier, spin torques are
obtained, and it is shown the model reproduces both damping-like and field-like
spin-transfer torques, with the expected sinusoidal angular dependence, and
inverse ferromagnetic layer thickness dependence. An explicit solution to the
drift-diffusion model is derived, which allows analysing the effect of both the
reference and free layer thickness on the spin-transfer torque polarization and
field-like coefficient. In particular, when the layers are thin, additional
spin-dependent scattering contributions due to incomplete absorption of
transverse spin components reduce both the damping-like and field-like spin
torques. It is shown the model developed here can be used to compute the
signal-to-noise ratio in realistic magnetic read-heads, where spin
torque-induced fluctuations and instabilities limit the maximum operating
voltage. The effect of metallic pinhole defects in the insulator layer is also
analysed, which results in a mixture of metallic and tunnelling transport, and
highly non-uniform charge and spin currents, requiring the full spin transport
model to compute the resulting magneto-resistance and spin torques. Increasing
the area covered by pinholes results in a rapid degradation of the
magneto-resistance, following an inverse dependence. Moreover, the spin torque
angular dependence becomes skewed, and the spin-transfer torque polarization
decreases. The same results are obtained when considering tunnel junctions with
a single pinhole defect, but decreasing cross-sectional area, showing that even
a single pinhole defect can significantly degrade the performance of tunnel
junctions and magnetic read-heads below the 40 nm node.

<h3>First-principles analysis of intravalley and intervalley electron-phonon  scattering in thermoelectric materials</h3>

<i>Vahid Askarpour, Jesse Maassen</i>
<br>
Intervalley collisions, which scatter electrons from one valley or band to
another, can be detrimental to thermoelectric performance in materials with
multiple valleys/bands. In this study, density functional theory is used to
investigate the electron-phonon scattering characteristics of three lead
chalcogenides (PbS, PbSe, PbTe) and three half-Heuslers (ScNiBi, ScPdSb,
ZrNiSn), which all possess multiple equivalent conduction valleys, in order to
characterize and analyze their intravalley/intervalley components. To elucidate
what controls the degree of intravalley and intervalley transitions, the
scattering rates are decomposed into the product of the phase space (a measure
of how much scattering is possible) and the average electron-phonon coupling.
To help guide the search for improved thermoelectric and high-conductivity
materials, simple and approximate approaches are demonstrated that can be
adopted to identify materials with reduced intervalley scattering, which
circumvent the need for computationally-demanding electron-phonon scattering
calculations. In addition, the benefits of selecting materials with
large-energy zone-edge phonons are explored in the limit $\hbar\omega \gg
k_BT$, and found to potentially suppress intervalley processes by up to an
order of magnitude, leading to a 70% and 100% increase in conductivity and
power factor, respectively.

With the goal of maximizing the thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit $ZT$,
Mahan and Sofo [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93, 7436 (1996)] found that the
optimal transport distribution (TD) is a delta function. Materials, however,
have TDs that appear to always be finite and non-diverging. Motivated by this
observation, this study focuses on deriving what is the optimal bounded TD,
which is determined to be a boxcar function for $ZT$ and a Heaviside function
for power factor. From these optimal TDs upper limits on $ZT$ and power factor
are obtained; the maximum $ZT$ scales with $\Sigma_{\rm max} T /\kappa_l$,
where $\Sigma_{\rm max}$ is the TD magnitude and $\kappa_l$ is the lattice
thermal conductivity. These results help establish practical upper limits on
the performance of TE materials and provide target TDs to guide band/scattering
engineering strategies.

<br>
A synthesis of single crystals of chiral dichalcogenides $TM_{3}X_{6}$ ($T$:
3$d$ transition metal, $M$: Nb or Ta, $X$: S or Se) remains an intriguing issue
for the investigation of emergent quantum properties such as chiral
helimagnetism. In this study, we investigated a correlation between the
quantity of Cr intercalation $x$ and magnetic property in single crystals of a
chromium (Cr) intercalated chiral disulfide Cr$_x$Nb$_3$S$_6$ in order to
optimize the synthesis condition for the intercalation-controlled single
crystals. The magnetic properties including a magnetic transition temperature
$T_{c}$ take different values depending on the samples. We systematically grew
single crystals of Cr$_{x}$Nb$_{3}$S$_{6}$ with $x$ ranged from 0.89 to 1.03
and found that the amount of the Cr intercalation $x$ is an essential factor in
controlling the magnetic properties of the grown crystals. The magnetization
anomaly, which appears in the temperature dependence as evidence of the
formation of chiral magnetic soliton lattice (CSL), was observed only in a
narrow region of $x$ from 0.98 to 1.03. The single crystals with $x$ being 0.98
and 0.99 showed the CSL behavior with the highest $T_{c}$ of 133 K. These
results indicate that small amount of defects on the sites for $T$ ions
dramatically affects the quality of the single crystals in the synthesis of
$TM_{3}$S$_{6}$. We also discuss an importance of synthesizing enantiopure
single crystals of chiral dichalgogenides in order to observe chiral physical

Density-functional theory is used to study the electronic structure of
quantum dots in a magnetic field. New series of magic numbers are found for the
total angular momentum of electrons. The empirical formula for the plateau
width is obtained. The effect of a charged impurity on the electronic structure
of a quantum dot has been studied.

An antiferromagnetic Chern insulator (AFCI) can exist if the effect of the
time-reversal transformation on the electronic state cannot be compensated by a
space group operation. The AFCI state with collinear magnetic order is already
realized in noncentrosymmetric honeycomb structures through the
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of the
collinear AFCI in a square lattice model which preserves the inversion
symmetry. Our study relies on the time-reversal-invariant
Harper-Hofstadter-Hubbard model extended by a next-nearest-neighbor hopping
term including spin-orbit coupling and a checkerboard potential. We show that
an easy $z$-axis AFCI appears between the band insulator at weak and the easy
$xy$-plane AF Mott insulator at strong Hubbard repulsion provided the
checkerboard potential is large enough. The close similarity between our
results and the results obtained for the noncentrosymmetric Kane-Mele-Hubbard
model suggests the AFCI as a generic consequence of spin-orbit coupling and
strong electronic correlation which exists beyond a specific model or lattice
structure. An AFCI with the electronic and the magnetic properties originating
from the same strongly interacting electrons is promising candidate for a
strong magnetic blue shift of the charge gap below the N\'eel temperature and
for realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect at higher temperatures so that
applications for data processing become possible.

The energy of an Andreev bound state in a clean normal metal in contact with
two superconductors disperses with the difference $\Delta \phi$ in the
superconducting phase between the superconductors in much the same way as the
energies of electrons in a one-dimensional crystal disperse with the crystal
momentum $k$ of the electrons. A normal metal with $n$ superconductors maps on
to a $n-1$ dimensional crystal, each dimension corresponding to the phase
difference $\phi_i$ between a specific pair of superconductors. The resulting
band structure as a function of the phase differences $\{\Delta \phi_i\}$ has
been proposed to have a topological nature, with gapped regions characterized
by different Chern numbers separated by regions where the gap in the
quasiparticle spectrum closes. A similar complex evolution of the quasiparticle
spectrum with $\{\Delta \phi_i\}$ has also been predicted for diffusive normal
metals in contact with multiple superconductors. Here we show that the
variation of the density of states at the Fermi energy of such a system can be
directly probed by relatively simple conductance measurements, allowing rapid
characterization of the energy spectrum.

<h3>Theory of elastic interaction between axially symmetric 3D skyrmions in  confined chiral nematic liquid crystals and in skyrmion bags</h3>

<br>
We study axially symmetrical 3D skyrmionic particles (torons, hopfions) in a
thin homeotropic cell filled with a cholesteric liquid crystal. In this case,
the contribution of the chirality term on far distances becomes small and a 3D
skyrmion can be described as a very specific particle in nematic with multipole
moments of different chiralities. We show that small skyrmions asymptotically
can be presented as a particle with six multipole moments. Thus, we find the
exact analytical solution for the far field director configuration around the
3D skyrmion and the exact analytical expression for the elastic interaction
potential between 3D skyrmions in a homeotropic cell with thickness $L$. The
comparison with the experiment allows us to recover approximately multipole
coefficients of one small 3D skyrmion. We also describe the expansion of the
skyrmion bag analytically depending on the number $N$ of anti-skyrmions in it
and obtain an agreement with the experiment.
Along the way, we determined the director field around a chiral axially
symmetric colloidal particle in the unlimited nematic liquid crystal and in the
confined homeotropic cell, taking into account higher order elastic terms with
orders $l=1\div 6$. We also have found the elastic interaction potential
between such particles.

<br>
It is now routine to make Bose-Einstein condensates of polaritons with long
enough lifetime and low enough disorder to travel ballistically for hundreds of
microns in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) wires. We present observations of a
polariton condensate injected at one point in a quasi-1D ring, with a
well-defined initial velocity and direction. A clear precession of the circular
polarization is seen, which arises from an effective spin-orbit coupling term
in the Hamiltonian. Our theoretical model accurately predicts the
experimentally observed behavior, and shows that "zitterbewegung" behavior
plays a role in the motion of the polaritons.

<br>
As a nontrivial solid state of matter, the glassy-crystal state embraces
physical features of both crystalline and amorphous solids, where a long-range
ordered periodic structure formed by the mass centers of constituent molecules
accommodates orientational glasses. Here, we discover and validate a
glassy-crystal state in 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMP, C4H11NO2) by
neutron scattering and complementary broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS)
measurements. The freezing process of the dynamic orientational disorder is
manifested at relaxation times well described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann
(VFT) law and the strongly frequency-dependent freezing temperature ranging
from around 225 K at 0.1 Hz to above room temperature in the GHz region. At
room temperature, the supercooled state is extremely sensitive to pressure such
that a few MPa pressure can induce crystallization to the ordered crystal
state, eventually leading to a temperature increase by 48 K within 20 s, a
significant reduction of visible light transmittance from about 95% to a few
percentages, and a remarkable decrease of electrical conductivity by three
orders of magnitude. These ultrasensitive baroresponsivities might find their
applications in low-grade waste heat recycling, pressure sensors and
non-volatile memory devices. It is expected that glassy crystals serve as an
emerging platform for exploiting exotic states of matter and the associated
fantastic applications.

<h3>Correlation-corrected band topology and topological surface states in  iron-based superconductors</h3>

<br>
Iron-based superconductors offer an ideal platform for studying topological
superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this paper, we carry out a
comprehensive study of the band topology and topological surface states of a
number of iron-based superconductors using a combination of density functional
theory (DFT) and dynamical mean field theory. We find that the strong
electronic correlation of Fe 3d electrons plays a crucial role in determining
the band topology and topological surface states of iron-based superconductors.
Electronic correlation not only strongly renormalizes the bandwidth of Fe 3d
electrons, but also shifts the band positions of both Fe 3d and As/Se p
electrons. As a result, electronic correlation moves the DFT-calculated
topological surface states of many iron-based superconductors much closer to
the Fermi level, which is crucial for realizing topological superconducting
surface states and observing Majorana zero modes as well as achieving practical
applications, such as quantum computation. More importantly, electronic
correlation can change the band topology and make some iron-based
superconductors topologically nontrivial with topological surface states
whereas they have trivial band topology and no topological surface states in
DFT calculations. Our paper demonstrates that it is important to take into
account electronic correlation effects in order to accurately determine the
band topology and topological surface states of iron-based superconductors and
other strongly correlated materials.

<br>
We develop a theory of anomalous elasticity in disordered two-dimensional
flexible materials with orthorhombic crystal symmetry. Similar to the clean
case, we predict existence of infinitely many flat phases with anisotropic
bending rigidity and Young's modulus showing power-law scaling with momentum
controlled by a single universal exponent the very same as in the clean
isotropic case. With increase of temperature or disorder these flat phases
undergo crumpling transition. Remarkably, in contrast to the isotropic
materials where crumpling occurs in all spatial directions simultaneously, the
anisotropic materials crumple into tubular phase. In distinction to clean case
in which crumpling transition happens at unphysically high temperatures, a
disorder-induced tubular crumpled phase can exist even at room-temperature
conditions. Our results are applied to anisotropic atomic single layers doped
by adatoms or disordered by heavy ions bombarding.

<br>
High-entropy alloys have shown much interest and unusual materials
properties. The stability of equimolar single-phase solid solution of five or
more elements is likely to be rare and identifying the existence of such alloys
has been very challenging because of the very large space of possible
combinations. Herein, based on high-throughput density-functional theory
calculations, we construct a chemical map of single-phase equimolar high
entropy alloys by investigating over 650000 equimolar quinary alloys through a
binary regular solid-solution model. We identify more than 30000 potential
single-phase equimolar alloys (5% of the possible combinations) forming mainly
in body-centered cubic structures. We unveil the chemistries that are likely to
form high-entropy alloys, and identify the complex interplay among mixing
enthalpy, intermetallics formation, and melting point that drives the formation
of these solid solutions. We demonstrate the power of our method by predicting
the existence of two new high entropy alloys, i.e. the body-centered cubic
AlCoMnNiV and the face-centered cubic CoFeMnNiZn, which are successfully
synthesized.

<h3>Hard Optimization Problems have Soft Edges</h3>

Finding a Maximum Clique is a classic property test from graph theory; find
any one of the largest complete subgraphs in an Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi $G(N,p)$
random graph. It is the simplest of many such problems in which algorithms
requiring only a small power of $N$ steps cannot reach solutions which
probabilistic arguments show must exist, exposing an inherently "hard" phase
within the solution space of the problem. Such "hard" phases are seen in many
NP-Complete problems, in the limit when $N \to \infty$. But optimization
problems arise and must be solved at finite N. We use this simplest case,
MaxClique, to explore the structure of the problem as a function of $N$ and
$K$, the clique size. It displays a complex phase boundary, a staircase of
steps at each of which $2 \log_2N$ and $K_{\text{max}}$, the maximum size of
clique that can be found, increase by $1$. Each of its boundaries have finite
width, and these widths allow local algorithms to find cliques beyond the
limits defined by the study of infinite systems. We explore the performance of
a number of extensions of traditional fast local algorithms, and find that much
of the "hard" space remains accessible at finite $N$.
The "hidden clique" problem embeds a clique somewhat larger than those which
occur naturally in a $G(N,p)$ random graph. Since such a clique is unique, we
find that local searches which stop early, once evidence for the hidden clique
is found, may outperform the best message passing or spectral algorithms.

<h3>Statistical mechanics of deep learning beyond the infinite-width limit</h3>

<br>
Modern deep neural networks represent a formidable challenge for theorists:
even simple one hidden layer fully-connected architectures are in general not
analytically tractable with statistical physics techniques. This fact
constitutes a barrier against a comprehensive theoretical understanding of deep
learning. Huge simplifications arise in the so-called infinite-width limit,
where the size of the each hidden layer $N_\ell$ ($\ell=1, \dots, L$, $L$ being
the total number of hidden layers of the architecture) is much larger than the
size of the dataset $P$. Infinite-width neural networks are well understood
since they are equivalent to a particular kernel learning problem. Here we show
that the thermodynamics of deep learning with a quadratic loss function, i.e.
the calculation of the partition function, is an analytically tractable problem
also far away from this limit and, more importantly, at fixed realization of
the training set, at least in the asymptotic limit where the size of the hidden
layers tends to infinity at fixed ratios $\alpha_\ell = P/N_\ell$. This means
that the computation of an extensive number of integrals over the weights of
the deep neural networks can be reduced to a saddle-point integration over a
finite number of order parameters. In the case of one hidden layer
architectures we are able to prove that our result is correct as long as the
covariance matrix of the training data satisfies the assumptions of a
generalized central limit theorem due to Breuer and Major. In the general case
of $L$ hidden layers we derive a $L$-dimensional effective action for the
learning problem, which is obtained by iterative integration of the weights
starting from the input layer.

<h3>A Statistical Perspective for Predicting the Strength of Metals:  Revisiting the Hall-Petch Relationship using Machine Learning</h3>

<i>Yejun Gu, Christopher D. Stiles, Jaafar A. El-Awady</i>
<br>
The mechanical properties of a material are intimately related to its
microstructure. This is particularly important for predicting mechanical
behavior of polycrystalline metals, where microstructural variations dictate
the expected material strength. Until now, the lack of microstructural
variability in available datasets precluded the development of robust
physics-based theoretical models that account for randomness of
microstructures. To address this, we have developed a probabilistic machine
learning framework to predict the flow stress as a function of variations in
the microstructural features. In this framework, we first generated an
extensive database of flow stress for a set of over a million randomly sampled
microstructural features, and then applied a combination of mixture models and
neural networks on the generated database to quantify the flow stress
distribution and the relative importance of microstructural features. The
results show excellent agreement with experiments and demonstrate that across a
wide range of grain size, the conventional Hall-Petch relationship is
statistically valid for correlating the strength to the average grain size and
its comparative importance versus other microstructural features. This work
demonstrates the power of the machine-learning based probabilistic approach for
predicting polycrystalline strength, directly accounting for microstructural
variations, resulting in a tool to guide the design of polycrystalline metallic
materials with superior strength, and a method for overcoming sparse data
limitations.

<br>
We show that the $t_{2g}^2$ perovskite LaVO$_3$, in its orthorhombic phase,
is a rare case of a system hosting an orbital-ordering Kugel-Khomskii phase
transition, rather than being controlled by the Coulomb-enhanced crystal-field
splitting. We find that, as a consequence of this, the magnetic transition is
close to (and even above) the super-exchange driven orbital-ordering
transition, whereas typically magnetism arises at much lower temperatures than
orbital ordering. Our results support the experimental scenario of
orbital-ordering and G-type spin correlations just above the
monoclinic-to-orthorhombic structural change. To explore the effects of
crystal-field splitting and filling, we compare to YVO$_3$ and $t_{2g}^1$
titanates. In all these materials the crystal-field is sufficiently large to
suppress the Kugel-Khomskii phase transition.

<br>
The Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) condensation and Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) are the two limiting ground states of paired Fermion
systems, and the crossover between these two limits has been a source of
excitement for both fields of high temperature superconductivity and cold atom
superfluidity. For superconductors, ultra-low doping systems like graphene and
LixZrNCl successfully approached the crossover starting from the BCS-side.
These superconductors offer new opportunities to clarify the nature of
charged-particles transport towards the BEC regime. Here we report the study of
vortex dynamics within the crossover using their Hall effect as a probe in
LixZrNCl. We observed a systematic enhancement of the Hall angle towards the
BCS-BEC crossover, which was qualitatively reproduced by the phenomenological
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory. LixZrNCl exhibits a band
structure free from various electronic instabilities, allowing us to achieve a
comprehensive understanding of the vortex Hall effect and thereby propose a
global picture of vortex dynamics within the crossover. These results
demonstrate that gate-controlled superconductors are ideal platforms towards
investigations of unexplored properties in BEC superconductors.

We develop a two-orbital Hubbard model of electron correlations in ultrathin
(111)-oriented fcc films of late transition metals such as Co and Ni. Our model
indicates that the Mott-Hund's interaction results in singlet orbital
correlations characterized by ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor orbital coupling.
Correlations are expected to be manifested by the dependence of magnetic
anisotropy on the hopping amplitude, which may provide an efficient approach to
controlling the magnetic properties of thin films for nanodevice applications.

ZrNCl and HfNCl belong to a class of layered transition metal nitride halides
MNCl (M= Zr,H). They are from the space group R-3m (No-166) and crystallize in
the rhombohedral structure. Both of these materials have shown promising
semiconducting behaviors. Recent studies have shown their versatility as
semiconductors and also as superconductors when intercalated with alkaline
metals. This paper explores the mechanical, optical and electronic properties
of these two semiconducting crystals in depth. A comparative study between the
two materials in their elastic constants, anisotropy measures, electronic
density of states and band structures, optical spectra has been performed with
first principles density functional theory (DFT) based calculations within the
local density approximation (with appropriate U for the energy gap calculations
in case of HfNCl). HfNCl is more machinable than ZrNCl and is relatively softer
as indicated by the lower Debye temperature. ZrNCl has stronger layering due to
which it exhibits brittle nature. HfNCl has a larger band gap. ZrNCl is a
better reflector of ultraviolet radiation. On the other hand HfNCl is a good
ultraviolet absorber. Both materials are anisotropic in regards to structure,
electronic energy dispersion and optical parameters. Overall, the degree of
anisotropy is more prominent in ZrNCl compared to that in HfNCl. Possible
sectors for applications of ZrNCl and HfNCl semiconductors are discussed.

Moir\'e materials, with superlattice periodicity many times the atomic length
scale, have enabled the studies of strong electronic correlations and band
topology with unprecedented tunability. However, nonvolatile control of the
moir\'e potentials, which could allow on-demand switching of the superlattice
effects, has not been achieved to date. Here we demonstrate the switching of
the correlated and moir\'e band insulating states and the associated nonlinear
anomalous Hall effect by the ferroelectric effect. This is achieved in a
ferroelectric WTe2 bilayer of the Td structure with a centered-rectangular
moir\'e superlattice induced by interfacing with a WSe2 monolayer of the H
structure. The results can be understood in terms of polarization-dependent
charge transfer between two WTe2 monolayers, which possess very different
moir\'e potential depths; ferroelectric switching thus turns on/off the
superlattice. Our study demonstrates the potential of creating new functional
moir\'e materials by incorporating intrinsic symmetry-breaking orders.

The Fe-based superconductor Fe (Se,Te) combines non-trivial topology with
unconventional superconductivity and may be an ideal platform to realize exotic
states such as high-order topological corner modes and Majorana modes. Thin
films of Fe (Se,Te) are important for device fabrication, phase sensitive
transport measurements and for realizing proposals to engineer higher-order
modes. However, while bulk Fe (Se,Te) has been extensively studied with a
variety of techniques, the nature of the superconducting order parameter in the
monolayer limit has not yet been explored. In this work, we study monolayer
films of Fe (Se,Te) on Bi2Te3 with scanning tunneling spectroscopy and
Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI). We discover that the monolayer Fe
(Se,Te)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures host a robust, multigap superconducting state
that strongly resembles the bulk. BQPI maps at the gap energies show a strong
spatial modulation, oriented 45 degrees to the Fe-Se bond direction. Analysis
of the phase-referenced quasiparticle interference signal reveals a
sign-changing s-wave order parameter similar to the bulk. Moreover, we observe
a unique pattern of sign changes in the BQPI signal which have not been
observed in the bulk. Our work establishes monolayer Fe (Se,Te)/Bi2Te3 as a
robust multi-band unconventional superconductor and sets the stage for
explorations of non-trivial topology in this highly-tunable system.

Incorporating relativistic physics into quantum tunneling can lead to exotic
behavior such as perfect transmission via Klein tunneling. Here, we probe the
tunneling properties of spin-momentum locked relativistic fermions by designing
and implementing a tunneling geometry that utilizes nanowires of the
topological Kondo insulator candidate, SmB6. The nanowires are attached to the
end of scanning tunneling microscope tips, and used to image the bicollinear
stripe spin-order in the antiferromagnet Fe1.03Te with a Neel temperature of
~50 K. The antiferromagnetic stripes become invisible above 10 K concomitant
with the suppression of the topological surface states. We further demonstrate
that the direction of spin-polarization is tied to the tunneling direction. Our
technique establishes SmB6 nanowires as ideal conduits for spin-polarized
currents.

The core structure of dislocations is critical to their mobility, cross slip,
and other plastic behaviors. Atomistic simulation of the core structure is
limited by the size of first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculation and the accuracy of classical molecular dynamics with empirical
interatomic potentials. Here, we utilize a Deep Potential (DP) method learned
from DFT calculations to investigate the dislocations of face-centered cubic
copper on a large scale and obtain their core structures and energies. The
validity of the DP description of the core structure and elastic strain from
dislocation is confirmed by a fully discrete Peierls model. Moreover, the DP
method can be further extended easily to dislocations with defects such as
surface or vacancy, and our study will pave a way in the large-scale atomistic
simulation of dislocation on the DFT level.

We study the phase diagram of the spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain
with uniaxial anisotropy and applied magnetic field in terms of the genuine
multipartite entanglement as witnessed by the mean quantum Fisher information
density. By generalizing the manifold studied in [1] to the many body case, we
connect the state space curvature in the vicinity of the ground state of the
Heisenberg chain to the genuine multipartite entanglement. Our analysis
demonstrates that the quantum critical points and SPT phase exhibit large
positive state space curvature. We further show that the entanglement in the
SPT phase is enhanced by the presence of uniaxial anisotropy, and undiminished
in the presence of uniform magnetic fields. The magnon condensate phase induced
by large fields is shown to emanate from the Gaussian critical point, and
exhibits massive multipartite entanglement over a robust region of the
parameter space.

Here we report successful synthesis of single crystalline magnetic Weyl
semimetal Co3Sn2S2. The synthesized crystal is characterized through various
tools viz. X-ray diffraction, field emission electron microscopy and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. A clear ferromagnetic transition is observed in
magnetization and heat capacity at around 175K, which is further verified
through electrical transport measurements. Hysteresis is observed in R-T
measurements in cooling and warming cycle, showing the presence of first order
phase transition and charge ordering in the synthesized sample. The synthesized
Co3Sn2S2 exhibits high magnetoresistance of around 230% at 2K. The transport
phenomenon in synthesized Co3Sn2S2 appears to have contributions from
topological surface states at low temperature below say 70 K, and above that
the same is found to be strongly dependent on its bulk magnetic state.
Magnetoconductivity data at low fields of up to plus minus 1T (Tesla) is fitted
with Hikami Larkin Nagaoka model, which shows the presence of weak
antilocalization effect in synthesized Co3Sn2S2 crystal at low temperatures

We predicted a new ternary hydride Li$_2$SiH$_6$ at high pressures. A
systematic structure search in Li$_2$SiH$_6$ compound reveals novel stable
phases with intriguing electronic and phonon properties. It is found that
Li$_2$SiH$_6$ is dynamically stable from ambient pressure up to 400 GPa with
three novel phases: P312, P$\bar{3}$, and P$\bar{6}$2m. The calculation of
electron-phonon coupling combined with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer's argument
indicates that this compound may be a candidate for high $T_c$ superconductors
under high pressures. In particular, the maximum $T_c$ of
$P\bar{6}2m$-Li$_2$SiH$_6$ at 400 GPa reaches 56 K. These findings may pave the
way for obtaining room temperature superconductors in dense hydrogen-rich
compounds.

<br>
Moir\'e superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
heterostructures give rise to rich excitonic phenomena associated with the
interlayer twist angle and induced changes in the involved quantum states.
Theoretical calculations of excitons in such systems are typically based on
model moir\'e potentials to mitigate the computational cost. However, an ab
initio understanding of the electron-hole coupling dominating the excitations
is crucial to realize the twist-induced modifications of the optical selection
rules. In this work we use many-body perturbation theory to compute and analyze
the relation between twist angle and exciton properties in twisted TMD
heterostructures. We present a general approach for unfolding excitonic states
from the moir\'e Brillouin zone onto the Brillouin zones of the separate
layers. Applying this method to a twisted MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ bilayer, we find
that the optical excitation spectrum is dominated by mixed transitions between
electrons and holes with different momenta in the separate monolayers, leading
to unexpected and angle-dependent hybridization between interlayer and
intralayer excitons. Our findings offer a design pathway for tuning exciton
layer-localization in TMD heterostructures as a function of twist angle.

<h3>Divergent phonon angular momentum driven by temperature and strain</h3>

<br>
<i>Young-Jae Choi, Seung-Hoon Jhi</i>
<br>
The phonon angular momentum (PAM) may exhibit exotic temperature dependence
as it is sensitive to the phonon lifetime. Constant phonon-lifetime
approximation fails to depict such behavior. Here, we study the PAM of AlN,
GaN, and graphene-like boron nitride (g-BN) monolayer with full consideration
of phonon lifetime using first-principles calculations. We show that wurtzite
AlN and GaN acquire divergent PAM at low temperatures from their lowest-lying
phonon branches. The g-BN monolayer, on the other hand, does not have finite
PAM at equilibrium structure. Rather it shows intriguing strain-dependence in
PAM; the compressive strain greater than the critical size generates divergent
PAM at low temperatures due to the divergent lifetime of TA phonons. As PAM
couples with rotational excitations in solids associated with charge, spin, or
electromagnetic fields, our study demonstrates a possibility of mechanical and
thermal engineering of such excitations.

<i>Tao Chen, Fengbo Yuan, Jianchuan Liu, Huayun Geng, Linfeng Zhang, Han Wang, Mohan Chen</i>
<br>
Constructing an accurate atomistic model for the high-pressure phases of tin
(Sn) is challenging because properties of Sn are sensitive to pressures. We
develop machine-learning-based deep potentials for Sn with pressures ranging
from 0 to 50 GPa and temperatures ranging from 0 to 2000 K. In particular, we
find the deep potential, which is obtained by training the ab initio data from
density functional theory calculations with the state-of-the-art SCAN
exchange-correlation functional, is suitable to characterize high-pressure
phases of Sn. We systematically validate several structural and elastic
properties of the {\alpha} (diamond structure), {\beta}, bct, and bcc
structures of Sn, as well as the structural and dynamic properties of liquid
Sn. The thermodynamics integration method is further utilized to compute the
free energies of the {\alpha}, {\beta}, bct, and liquid phases, from which the
deep potential successfully predicts the phase diagram of Sn including the
existence of the triple-point that qualitatively agrees with the experiment.

<br>
Delocalized carbon-based radical species with unpaired spin, such as
phenalenyl (PLY) radical, opened avenues for developing multifunctional organic
spintronic devices. Here we develop a novel technique based on a
three-dimensional shadow mask and the in-situ deposition to fabricate PLY-,
Cu-PLY-, and Zn-PLY-based organic magnetic tunnel junctions (OMTJs) with area
3x8 {\mu}m2 and improved morphology. The nonlinear and weakly
temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in combination with
the low organic barrier height suggest tunneling as the dominant transport
mechanism in the structurally and dimensionally optimized OMTJs. Cu-PLY-based
OMTJs, show a significant magnetoresistance up to 14 percent at room
temperature due to the formation of hybrid states at the metal-molecule
interfaces called spinterface, which reveals the importance of spin-dependent
interfacial modification in OMTJs design. In particular, Cu-PLY OMTJs shows a
stable voltage-driven resistive switching response that suggests their use as a
new viable and scalable platform for building molecular scale quantum
memristors and processors.

<h3>Role of particles size on the cohesive strength of non-sintered (green)  ceramics</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Hristova, I. Lesov, L. Mihaylov, N. Denkov, S. Tcholakova</i>
<br>
Preparation of particle-loaded foams, followed by drying, sintering and/or
cross-linking are widely explored routes for developing lightweight ceramics
with high mechanical strength. The non-sintered dry ceramic foams are less
studied due to their intricate production and the assumed poor mechanical
strength of the obtained "green" materials. Here we produce lightweight
ceramics from foamed particle suspensions containing spherical silica particles
with radii varied between 4.5 nm and 7 {\mu}m. The wet foams were prepared in
the presence of cationic surfactant and were dried at ambient conditions to
obtain porous materials with mass densities between 100 and 700 kg/m3. The
materials containing smaller particles exhibited much higher strength (up to
2000 times), approaching that of the sintered materials. A new theoretical
expression for predicting the mechanical strength of such materials was derived
and was used to explain the measured strengths of the produced materials
through the van der Waals attractions between the particles in the final dry
materials.

<h3>Flat bands, edge states and possible topological phases in a branching  fractal</h3>

<br>
<i>Sougata Biswas, Amrita Mukherjee, Arunava Chakrabarti</i>
<br>
We address the problem of analytically extracting a countable infinity of
flat, non-dispersive bands in a periodic array of cells that comprise branching
Vicsek geometries of higher and higher generations. Through a geometric
construction, followed by an exact real space renormalization scheme we unravel
clusters of compact localized states, corresponding to densely packed groups of
flat bands, sometimes in close proximity with the dispersive ones, as the unit
cells accommodate Vicsek fractal motifs of higher and higher generations. In
such periodic arrays, energy bands close and open at energies that can be
calculated exactly, and the precise correlation between the overlap integrals
describing the tight binding systems can be worked out. The possibility of a
topological phase transition is pointed out through an explicit construction of
the edge states, weakly protected against disorder, though it is argued that
the typical bulk-boundary correspondence is not holding good in such cases.

<br>
Mixtures of quantum fluids, that is gases or liquids, are considered with the
emphasis on the conditions characterizing the stability of the mixtures. The
mixtures, that can be formed by cold atoms or molecules, are assumed to be
quantum requiring the description using quantum techniques, but not so cold
that to exhibit superfluidity or superconductivity. Reviewing the stability
conditions of such normal quantum systems is important for the comparison of
these conditions with the stability conditions of, e.g., Bose-condensed
mixtures. The behavior of observable quantities under the stratification of
quantum mixtures is discussed.

<h3>Holes and magnetic polarons in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<i>Jasper van de Kraats, Kristian K. Nielsen, Georg M. Bruun</i>
<br>
The intricate interplay between charge motion and magnetic order in
geometrically frustrated lattices is central for the properties of many
two-dimensional quantum materials. The triangular lattice antiferromagnet is a
canonical example of a frustrated system, and here we analyse the dynamics of a
hole in such a lattice focusing on observables that have become accessible in a
new generation of experiments. Using the $t$-$J$ model, we solve the problem
exactly within linear spin wave theory in the limit of strong magnetic
interactions, showing that the ground state is described by a coherent state of
spin waves. The derivation highlights the crucial role played by the
interaction between a static hole and the neighboring spins, which originates
in the geometric frustration and has often been omitted in earlier works.
Furthermore, we show that the non-equilibrium dynamics after a hole has
abruptly been inserted at a lattice site is given exactly by a coherent state
with time-dependent oscillatory coefficients. Physically, this describes a
burst of magnetic frustration propagating through only two-thirds of the
lattice sites, since a destructive interference of spin waves leaves spins
parallel to that removed by the hole unperturbed. After the wave has propagated
through the lattice, the magnetization relaxes to that of the ground state. We
then use our analytical solution to benchmark the widely used self-consistent
Born approximation (SCBA), showing that it is very accurate also for a
triangular lattice. The magnetic polaron spectrum is analysed for general
magnetic interactions using the SCBA, and we compare our results with those for
a square lattice.

<br>
Sessile droplets of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline material were
exposed to surface electric fields produced by pyroelectric and photogalvanic
(photovoltaic) effects in X-cut iron-doped lithium niobate crystals. The
resulting dynamic processes were monitored by polarization optical
(video)microscopy (POM). During heating/cooling cycles, at first, the droplets
change their shape from spherical to extended ellipsoidal. Then they start to
move rapidly along the surface electric field, i.e., along the crystal's polar
axis (c-axis). During this motion, several droplets merge into running streams
(tendrils) extending towards the edges of the top surface area. Finally,
practically all liquid crystalline material is transported from the top surface
to the side surfaces of the crystal. At stabilized temperature, laser
illumination of the assembly causes dynamic processes that are localized to the
illuminated area. Also, in this case, the LC droplets merge into several
tendril-like formations that are preferentially oriented along the c-axis of
the crystal. The pattern of tendrils fluctuates with time, but it persists as
long as the illumination is present. In this case, the LC material is
transported between the central and the edge region of the illuminated area.

<br>
Motivated by the presence of an extremely small electron pocket in the
electronic band structure of infinite-layer (IL) nickelate superconductors, we
systematically explore the superconducting (SC) properties of a two-dimensional
Hubbard model influenced by a conduction band with small occupancy (dry Fermi
sea). Our dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo calculations demonstrated the
unusual impact of this additional dry metallic layer, which shifts the SC dome
of the correlated Hubbard layer towards the overdoped regime, namely the
$d$-wave SC can be enhanced (suppressed) by a dry conduction band in the
overdoped (underdoped) regime. Simultaneously, the pseudogap (PG) crossover
line shifts to the same higher doping regime as well. Our analysis revealed the
interplay of the effective pairing interaction, pair-field susceptibility, and
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the underlying non-monotonic physics. We
postulate on the physical picture of SC dome shift in terms of the Kondo-type
electron-hole binding. Our investigation provided valuable new insights on
tuning the SC properties via external dry bands.

<h3>Modeling X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Macromolecules Using GW</h3>

<br>
We propose a simple additive approach to simulate X-ray photoelectron spectra
(XPS) of macromolecules based on the $GW$ method. Single-shot $GW$ ($G_0W_0$)
is a promising technique to compute accurate core-electron binding energies
(BEs). However, its application to large molecules is still unfeasible. To
circumvent the computational cost of $G_0W_0$, we break the macromolecule into
tractable building blocks, such as isolated monomers, and sum up the
theoretical spectra of each component, weighted by their molar ratio. In this
work, we provide a first proof of concept by applying the method to four test
polymers and one copolymer, and show that it leads to an excellent agreement
with experiments. The method could be used to retrieve the composition of
unknown materials and study chemical reactions, by comparing the simulated
spectra with experimental ones.

Organic semiconductor crystals stand out as an efficient, cheap and diverse
platform for realising optoelectronic applications. The optical response of
these crystals is governed by a rich tapestry of exciton physics. So far,
little is known on the phonon-driven singlet exciton dynamics in this class of
materials. In this joint theory-experiment work, we combine the fabrication of
a high-quality oligoacene semiconductor crystal and characterization via
photoluminescence measurements with a sophisticated approach to the microscopic
modeling in these crystals. This allows us to investigate singlet exciton
optics and dynamics. We predict phonon-bottleneck effects in pentacene
crystals, where we find dark excitons acting as crucial phonon-mediated
relaxation scattering channels. While the efficient singlet fission in
pentacene crystals hampers the experimental observation of this bottleneck
effect, we reveal both in theory and experiment a distinct polarisation- and
temperature-dependence in absorption and photoluminescence spectra of tetracene
crystals, including microscopic origin of exciton linewidths, the activation of
the higher Davydov states at large temperatures, and polarisation-dependent
quenching of specific exciton resonances. Our joint theory-experiment study
represents a significant advance in microscopic understanding of singlet
exciton optics and dynamics in oligoacene crystals.

<h3>Evidence of exchange-striction and charge disproportionation in the  magneto-electric material Ni3TeO6</h3>

<br>
The chiral magneto-electric compound Ni3TeO6 is investigated through
temperature-dependent synchrotron-based powder x-ray diffraction and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy between 15 to 300 K. Our work provides direct evidence
for the exchange-striction in the material around the concomitant onset point
of collinear antiferromagnetic and magneto-electric phases. The x-ray
absorption near edge spectra and x-ray photoelectron spectra show that the
sample consists of both Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions in the lattice. The ionic state of
Ni is found to be quite robust, and it is largely independent of the
preparation route. Additionally, the minority Te4+ state is found to coexist
with the majority Te6+ state, which may arise from the charge
disproportionation between Ni and Te ions (Ni2+ + Te6+ --> Ni3+ + Te4+). The
observed mixed valency of Ni is also confirmed by the total paramagnetic moment
per Ni atom in the system. This mixed valency in the metal ions and the
exchange-striction may be attributed to the observed magneto-electric effect in
the system.

<h3>Pair binding and enhancement of pairing correlations in asymmetric  Hubbard ladders</h3>

Asymmetric two-leg Hubbard ladders with different on-site interactions $U_y$
and hoppings $t_y$ on each leg are investigated using the density matrix
renormalization group method and exact diagonalizations. The pairing found in
symmetric ladders is robust against the introduction of the leg asymmetry. When
studying pairing, one-band Hubbard ladder models are better described as
one-dimensional correlated two-band models than as sublattices of higher
dimensional systems. The asymmetric Hubbard ladder provides us with a simple
model for studying pairing in the crossover regime between charge transfer and
Mott insulators.

Quantum gas systems are ideal analog quantum simulation platforms for
tackling some of the most challenging problems in strongly correlated quantum
matter. However, they also expose the urgent need for new theoretical
frameworks. Simple models in one dimension, well studied with conventional
methods, have received considerable recent attention as test cases for new
approaches. Ladder models provide the logical next step, where established
numerical methods are still reliable, but complications of higher dimensional
effects like gauge fields can be introduced. In this paper, we investigate the
application of the recently developed neural-network quantum states in the
two-leg Bose-Hubbard ladder under strong synthetic magnetic fields. Based on
the restricted Boltzmann machine and feedforward neural network, we show that
variational neural networks can reliably predict the superfluid-Mott insulator
phase diagram in the strong coupling limit comparable with the accuracy of the
density-matrix renormalization group. In the weak coupling limit, neural
networks also diagnose other many-body phenomena like the vortex, chiral and
biased-ladder phases. Our work demonstrates that the two-leg Bose-Hubbard model
with magnetic flux is an ideal test ground for future developments of
neural-network quantum states.

The recent discovery nickel oxides superconductors have highlighted the
importance of first-principles simulations for understanding the formation of
the bound electrons at the core of superconductivity. Nevertheless,
superconductivity in oxides is often ascribed to strong electronic correlation
effects that Density Functional Theory (DFT) cannot properly take into account,
thereby disqualifying this technique. Being isostructural to nickel oxides,
Sr1-xKxBiO3 superconductors form an ideal testbed for unveiling (i) the lowest
theory level needed to model complex superconductors and (ii) the underlying
pairing mechanism yielding superconductivity. Here I show that parameter-free
DFT simulations capture all the experimental features and related quantities of
Sr1-xKxBiO3 superconductors, encompassing the prediction of an insulating to
metal phase transition upon increasing the K doping content and of an
electron-phonon coupling constant of 1.22 in sharp agreement with the
experimental value of 1.3 +/- 0.2. Proximity of a disproportionated phase is
further demonstrated to be a prerequisite for superconductivity in bismuthates.
This work highlights that appropriately executed DFT is a sufficient platform
for studying superconductivity in complex oxides.

<br>
Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and
spin-orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate
correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over
decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides are seldomly explored
due to the difficulty in synthesizing high-quality and correct composition
nitride films. Here we report the fabrication of single-crystalline
ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thickness. As film
thickness decreasing, the magnetization deteriorates dramatically, and
electronic state transits from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the
high-temperature ferromagnetism maintains in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down
to 2 u. c. (~ 8 {\AA}). The magnetoresistance exhibits a strong in-plane
anisotropy and meanwhile the anomalous Hall resistance reserves its sign when
Fe3N layer thickness exceeds 5 u. c. Furthermore, we observe a sizable exchange
bias at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic
CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depend on the
controllable bending curvature using cylinder diameter engineering (CDE)
technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This
work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying
their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives towards the practical
applications.

<i>Anirudha Mirmira, N.S. Vidhyadhiraja</i>
<br>
We study the steady-state dc transport characteristics of a system comprised
of an interacting quantum dot, modelled as an Anderson impurity, coupled to two
metallic non-interacting leads with Rashba SOC, using an interpolative
perturbative approach (IPA). The single-particle spectra, current and
differential conductance are obtained in weak and strong coupling regimes over
a wide range of SOC and bias values. Extensive benchmarking of the IPA
validates the method in the linear as well as non-linear response regime. The
universal, zero bias ($V_{sd}=0$) peak with a width proportional to the Kondo
scale ($T_K$) and two non-universal finite bias peaks around $V_{sd}=\pm U$ in
the zero temperature differential conductance show a clear separation with
increasing $U$ or increasing SOC. In the strong coupling regime, increasing
temperature induces melting of the zero bias peak leading to a crossover from a
three-peak conductance to a two-peak conductance. Recent experiments find the
emergence of a two-peak structure by increasing SOC at a fixed temperature. Our
results appear to provide a qualitative explanation of these observations as a
SOC tuned crossover from weak/intermediate to strong coupling, and a
simultaneous crossover from low $T/T_K$ to high $T/T_K$ ratio. We also
reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the zero bias
conductance.

The aim of this paper is to determine the behavior of the specific heat of
the 4-dimensional Ising model at the critical temperature, and via that
determine if the Ising model and the $\phi^4$-model belong to the same
universality class in dimension 4. In order to do this we have carried out what
is currently the largest scale simulations of the 4-dimensional Ising model,
extending the lattices size up to $L=256$ and the number of samples per size by
several orders of magnitude compared to earlier works, keeping track of data
for both the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. Our conclusion is that the
Ising model has a bounded specific heat, while the $\phi^4$-model is known to
have a logarithmic divergence at the critical point. Hence the two models
belong to distinct universality classes in dimension 4.

Ionic and molecular selectivity is considered unique for the nanoscale and
not realizable in microfluidics. This is due to the scale-matching problem -- a
difficulty to match the dimensions of ions and electrostatic potential
screening lengths with the micron-sized confinements. Here, we demonstrate a
microscale realization of the ionic transport processes closely resembling
those specific to ionic channels or in nanofluidic junctions, including
selectivity, guidance through complex geometries and flow focusing. As a model
system, we explore electrokinetic spherical Janus micromotors moving over
charged surfaces with a complex spatial charge distribution and without any
topographical wall. We discuss peculiarities of the long-range electrostatic
interaction on the behavior of the system including interface crossing and
reflection of positively charged particles from negatively charged interfaces.
These results are crucial for understanding the electrokinetic transport of
biochemical species under confinement, have the potential to increase the
precision of lab-on-chip-based assays, as well as broadening use cases and
control strategies of nano-/micromachinery.

<br>
In recent work, we developed a screening theory for describing the effect of
plastic events in amorphous solids on its emergent mechanics. The suggested
theory uncovered an anomalous mechanical response of amorphous solids where
plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are analogous to
dislocations in crystalline solids. The theory was tested against various
models of amorphous solids in two-dimensions, including frictional and
friction-less granular media and numerical models of amorphous glass. Here we
extend our theory to screening in three-dimensional amorphous solids and
predict the existence of anomalous mechanics similar to the one observed in
two-dimensional systems. We conclude by interpreting the mechanical response as
the formation of non-topological distributed dipoles that have no analogue in
the crystalline defects literature. Having in mind that the onset of dipole
screening is reminiscent of Kosterlitz-Thouless and Hexatic transitions, the
finding of dipole screening in three-dimensions is particularly novel.

The elucidation of the mechanisms behind chiral-induced spin selectivity
remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we consider the role of
delocalised phonon modes in electron transport in chiral structures and
demonstrate that spin selectivity can originate from spin-dependent energy and
momentum conservation in electron-phonon scattering events. While this
mechanism is robust to the specifical nature of the vibrational modes, the
degree of spin polarization depends on environmental factors, such as external
driving fields, temperatures and phonon relaxation rates. This dependence is
used to present experimentally testable predictions of our model.

FePS$_3$ is a prototype van der Waals layered antiferromagnet and a Mott
insulator under ambient conditions, which has been recently reported to go
through a pressure-induced dimensionality crossover and an insulator-to-metal
transition. These transitions also lead to the appearance of a novel magnetic
metallic state. To further understand these emergent structural and physical
properties we have performed a first-principles study using van der Waals and
Hubbard U corrected density functional theory including a random structure
search. Our computational study attempts to interpret the experimental
co-existence of the low- and intermediate-pressure phases and we predict a
novel high-pressure phase with distinctive dimensionality and different
possible origins of metallicity.

Biaxial nematic ($N_B$) liquid crystals have been indicated as promising
candidates for the design of next-generation displays with novel
electro-optical properties and faster switching times. While at the molecular
scale their existence is still under debate, experimental evidence, supported
by theory and simulation, has unambiguously proved that suitable colloidal
particles can indeed form $N_B$ fluids under specific conditions. While this
discovery has sparked a widespread interest in the characterisation of the
phase behaviour of $N_B$ liquid crystals, significantly less attention has been
devoted to the study of their transport properties. To bridge this gap, by
Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations we have investigated the equilibrium dynamics
of field-induced $N_B$ phases comprising monodisperse hard cuboids. In
particular, we calculated the long-time self-diffusion coefficients of cuboids
over a wide range of anisotropies, spanning prolate to oblate geometries.
Additionally, we have compared these diffusivities with those that, upon
switching the external field off, are measured in the thermodynamically-stable
isotropic or uniaxial nematic phases at the same density. Our results indicate
that while prolate cuboids diffuse significantly faster in biaxial nematics
than in less ordered fluids, we do not observe such an increase with oblate
cuboids at high packing fractions. We show that these changes are most likely
due to the field-induced freezing of the axes perpendicular to the nematic
director, along with a substantial increase in the ordering of the resulting
$N_B$ phase.

<h3>Thermodynamics, formation dynamics and structural correlations in the  bulk amorphous phase of the phase-field crystal model</h3>

We investigate bulk thermodynamic and microscopic structural properties of
amorphous solids in the framework of the phase-field crystal (PFC) model. These
are metastable states with a non-uniform density distribution having no
long-range order. From extensive numerical simulations we determine the
distribution of free energy density values in varying size amorphous systems
and also the point-to-set correlation length, which is the radius of the
largest volume of amorphous one can take while still having the particle
arrangements within the volume determined by the particle ordering at the
surface of the chosen volume. We find that in the thermodynamic limit, the free
energy density of the amorphous tends to a value that has a slight dependence
on the initial state from which it was formed -- i.e.\ it has a formation
history dependence. The amorphous phase is observed to form on both sides of
the liquid linear-stability limit, showing that the liquid to amorphous
transition is first order, with an associated finite free energy barrier when
the liquid is metastable. In our simulations this is demonstrated when noise in
the initial density distribution is used to induce nucleation events from the
metastable liquid. Depending on the strength of the initial noise, we observe a
variety of nucleation pathways, in agreement with previous results for the PFC
model, and which show that amorphous precursor mediated multi-step crystal
nucleation can occur in colloidal systems.

<h3>Direct measurement of electrocaloric effect based on multi-harmonic  lock-in thermography</h3>

<br>
In this study, we report on a direct measurement method for the
electrocaloric effect, the heating/cooling upon application/removal of an
electric field in dielectric materials, based on a lock-in thermography
technique. By use of sinusoidal excitation and multi-harmonic detection, the
actual temperature change can be measured by a single measurement in the
frequency domain even when the electrocaloric effect shows nonlinear response
to the excitation field. We have demonstrated the method by measuring the
temperature dependence of the electric-field-induced temperature change for two
Sr-doped BaTiO$_3$ systems with different ferroelectric-paraelectric phase
transition temperatures, where the procedure for extracting the pure
electrocaloric contribution free from heat losses and Joule heating due to
leakage currents is introduced. This method can be used irrespective of the
type of dielectric materials and enables simultaneous estimation of the
polarization change and power dissipation during the application of the
electric field, being a convenient imaging measurement method for the
electrocaloric effect.

<h3>An Ising model for the thermal and dynamic properties of supercooled  liquids and the glass transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05388" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05388</a>

We describe the behavior of an Ising model with orthogonal dynamics, where
changes in energy and changes in alignment never occur during the same Monte
Carlo (MC) step. This orthogonal Ising model (OIM) allows conservation of
energy and conservation of momentum to proceed independently, on their own
preferred time scales. MC simulations of the OIM mimic more than twenty
distinctive characteristics that are commonly found above and below the glass
temperature, Tg. Examples include a specific heat that has hysteresis around
Tg, out-of-phase loss that exhibits primary and secondary peaks,
super-Arrhenius T dependence for the alpha response time, and fragilities that
increase with increasing system size (N). Mean-field theory for energy
fluctuations in the OIM yields a novel expression for the super-Arrhenius
divergence. Because this divergence is reminiscent of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann
(VFT) law squared, we call it the VFT2 law. A modified Stickel plot, which
linearizes the VFT2 law, gives qualitatively consistent agreement with
measurements of primary response (from the literature) on five glass-forming
liquids. Such agreement with the OIM suggests that several basic features
govern supercooled liquids. The freezing of a liquid into a glass involves an
underlying 2nd-order transition that is broadened by finite-size effects. The
VFT2 law comes from energy fluctuations that enhance the pathways through an
entropy bottleneck, not activation over an energy barrier. Primary response
times vary exponentially with inverse N, consistent with the distribution of
relaxation times deduced from measurements. System sizes found via the T
dependence of the primary response are similar to sizes of independently
relaxing regions measured by nuclear magnetic resonance for simple-molecule
glass-forming liquids. The OIM provides a broad foundation for more-detailed
models of liquid-glass behavior.

<h3>High-temperature kinetic magnetism in triangular lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05398" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05398</a>
<br>
<i>Ivan Morera, Márton Kanász-Nagy, Tomasz Smolenski, Livio Ciorciaro, Ataç Imamoğlu, Eugene Demler</i>
<br>
We study kinetic magnetism for the Fermi-Hubbard models in triangular type
lattices, including a zigzag ladder, four- and six-legged triangular cylinders
and a full two-dimensional triangular lattice. We focus on the regime of strong
interactions, $U\gg t$ and filling factors around one electron per site. For
temperatures well above the hopping strength, the Curie-Weiss form of the
magnetic susceptibility suggests effective antiferromagnetic correlations for
systems that are hole doped with respect to $\nu=1$, and ferromagnetic
correlations for systems with electron dopings. We show that these correlations
arise from magnetic polaron dressing of charge carrier propagating in a spin
incoherent Mott insulator. Effective interactions corresponding to these
correlations can strongly exceed the magnetic super-exchange energy. In the
case of hole doping, antiferromagnetic polarons originate from kinetic
frustration of individual holes in a triangular lattice. In the case of
electron doping, Nagaoka type ferromagnetic correlations are induced by
propagating doublons. These results provide a theoretical explanation of recent
experimental results in moire TMDC materials. To understand many-body states
arising from antiferromagentic polarons at low temperatures, we study hole
doped systems in finite magnetic fields. At low dopings and intermediate
magnetic fields we find a magnetic polaron phase, separated from the fully
polarized state by a metamagnetic transition. With decreasing magnetic field
the system shows a tendency to phase separate, with hole rich regions forming
antiferromagnetic spinbags. We demonstrate that direct observations of magnetic
polarons in triangular lattices can be achieved in experiments with ultracold
atoms, which allow measurements of three point hole-spin-spin correlations.

<h3>Pseudogap metal and magnetization plateau from doping moiré Mott  insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05430" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05430</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Zhang, Liang Fu</i>
<br>
The problem of doping Mott insulators is of fundamental importance and
long-standing interest in the study of strongly correlated electron systems.
The advent of semiconductor based moir\'e materials opens a new ground for
simulating the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice and exploring the rich
phase diagram of doped Mott insulators as a function of doping and external
magnetic field. Based on our recent identification of spin polaron
quasiparticle in Mott insulator, in this work we predict a new metallic state
emerges at small doping and intermediate field range, a pseudogap metal that
exhibits a single-particle gap and a doping-dependent magnetization plateau.
