<h3>Velocity-Dependent Forces and Non-Hydrodynamic Initial Conditions in  Quantum and Classical Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06157" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06157</a>

<i>T.R. Kirkpatrick, D. Belitz</i>

We consider a fermionic fluid in a non-equilibrium steady state where the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not valid and fields conjugate to the
hydrodynamic variables are explicitly required to determine response functions.
We identify velocity-dependent forces in the kinetic equation that are
equivalent to such fields. They lead to driving terms in the hydrodynamic
equations and to corrections to the hydrodynamic initial conditions.

<h3>Quantum Phases in the Honeycomb-Lattice $J_1$--$J_3$  Ferro-Antiferromagnetic Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06062" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06062</a>
<br>
<i>Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, A. L. Chernyshev</i>
<br>
<br>
Using large-scale density-matrix renormalzation group calculations and
minimally augmented spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that the phase diagram of
the quantum $S\!=\!\frac12$ $J_1$--$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic model on the
honeycomb lattice differs dramatically from the classical one. It hosts
double-zigzag and Ising-z phases, as unexpected intermediaries between
ferromagnetic and zigzag states that are also extended beyond their classical
regions of stability. In broad agreement with quantum order-by-disorder
arguments, these collinear phases replace the classical spiral state.

<h3>Tunneling spectra of impurity states in unconventional superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06069</a>
<br>
<i>P. O. Sukhachov, Felix von Oppen, L. I. Glazman</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the role of the Bloch functions and superconducting gap
symmetries on the formation and properties of impurity-induced resonances in a
2D superconductor, and elucidate their manifestation in scanning tunneling
spectra. We use and extend a recently developed scattering approach,
conveniently formulating the results in terms of the phase shifts of electron
scattering off the impurity. We find that the discrete subgap states in a
nodeless-gap superconductor are insensitive to the potential scattering phase
shift (common for the two spin species) if time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is
preserved. The independence of potential scattering is exact for $s$-wave
superconductors. It remains an accurate approximation over a broad range of
subgap energies when the gap function breaks the lattice point symmetry, except
for a narrow region below the gap edge. Breaking of TRS makes potential
scattering capable of creating spin-degenerate subgap states, which may be
further split by spin-dependent scattering. In nodal-gap superconductors,
impurity-induced resonances are broadened by coupling to the quasiparticle
continuum. We identify the conditions allowing for the formation of narrow
resonances. In addition to finding the energy spectrum, we evaluate the
spin-resolved differential conductance for all of the considered symmetries and
gap structures.

<h3>Numerical simulations of long-range open quantum many-body dynamics with  tree tensor networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06075</a>
<br>
<i>Dominik Sulz, Christian Lubich, Gianluca Ceruti, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo</i>
<br>
<br>
Open quantum systems provide a conceptually simple setting for the
exploration of collective behavior stemming from the competition between
quantum effects, many-body interactions, and dissipative processes. They may
display dynamics distinct from that of closed quantum systems or undergo
nonequilibrium phase transitions which are not possible in classical settings.
However, studying open quantum many-body dynamics is challenging, in particular
in the presence of critical long-range correlations or long-range interactions.
Here, we make progress in this direction and introduce a numerical method for
open quantum systems, based on tree tensor networks. Such a structure is
expected to improve the encoding of many-body correlations and we adopt an
integration scheme suited for long-range interactions and applications to
dissipative dynamics. We test the method using a dissipative Ising model with
power-law decaying interactions and observe signatures of a first-order phase
transition for power-law exponents smaller than one.

<h3>Finite temperature second harmonic generation in Kitaev magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06076</a>
<br>
<i>Olesia Krupnitska, Wolfram Brenig</i>
<br>
<br>
We study electric field induced second harmonic generation (2HG) in the
Kitaev model. This frustrated magnet hosts a quantum spin-liquid, featuring
fractionalization in terms of mobile Majorana fermion and static
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux-vison elementary excitations. We show that finite
temperature 2HG allows to probe characteristic features of both fractional
quasiparticle types. In the homogeneous flux state at low-temperatures, the 2HG
susceptibility displays an oscillatory spectrum, which is set by only the
fermionic excitations and is subject to temperature induced Fermi-blocking,
generic to all higher harmonic generation (HHG). In the intermediate to high
temperature range, intrinsic randomness, which emerges from thermally excited
visons leads to drastic changes of the 2HG susceptibility, resulting from
resonance decoupling over a wide range of energies. At the flux proliferation
crossover, we suggest an interpolation between these two temperature regimes.
Our results satisfy previously established symmetries for electric field
induced 2HG in Kitaev magnets.

<h3>Generic mobility edges in several classes of duality-breaking  one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06081</a>
<br>
<i>DinhDuy Vu, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
We obtain exact and almost-exact analytical solutions defining the mobility
edge separating localized and extended states for several classes of generic
one-dimensional quasiperiodic models. We validate our analytical ansatz with
exact numerical calculations. Rather amazingly, we provide a single simple
ansatz for the generic mobility edge, which is satisfied by quasiperiodic
models involving many different types of nonsinusoidal incommensurate
potentials as well as many different types of long-range hopping models. Our
ansatz agrees precisely with the well-known limiting cases of the
Aubry-Andr\'{e} model (which has no mobility edge) and the generalized
Aubry-Andr\'{e} models (which have analytical mobility edges). Our work
establishes the unexpected richness of quasiperiodic localization, reflecting
subtle internal mathematical structures leading to analytically tractable
generic localization conditions.

<h3>Phonon-Induced Collective Modes in Spin-Orbit Coupled Polar Metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06083</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishek Kumar, Premala Chandra, Pavel A. Volkov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the interplay between collective electronic and lattice modes in
polar metals in an applied magnetic field aligned with the polar axis. Static
spin-orbit coupling leads to the appearance of a particle-hole spin-flip
continuum that is gapped at low energies in a finite field. We find that a weak
spin-orbit assisted coupling between electrons and polar phonons leads to the
appearance of new electronic collective modes. The strength of the applied
magnetic field tunes the number of modes and their energies, which can lie both
above and below the particle-hole continuum. For a range of field values, we
identify Fano-like interference between the electronic continuum and phonons.
We show that signatures of these collective modes can be observed in electron
spin resonance experiments, and we provide the corresponding theoretical
predictions.

<h3>The emergence of interface states in graphene/transition metal  dichalcogenides heterostructure with lateral interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06086" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06086</a>
<br>
<i>Zahra Khatibi, Stephen R. Power</i>
<br>
<br>
The relative strength of different proximity spin-orbit couplings in graphene
on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) can be tuned via the metal
composition in the TMDC layer. While Gr/MoSe$_2$, has a normal gap, proximity
to WSe$_2$ instead leads to valley-Zeeman-driven inverted bands. Although the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ index vanishes, these systems enable a concentration-dependent
topological crossover with band gap closure when graphene is stacked on a
composite or alloyed TMDC layer. This is due to a nonzero Berry curvature at
the individual valleys and a change of the valley Chern index at a critical
composition ratio. Therefore, inherently, we also expect that stacked
heterostructures of graphene on composite TMDC layers should host localised
boundary modes due to the presence of Gr/WSe$_2$- and Gr/MoSe$_2$-like domains
with opposite valley Chern indices. In this study, we show that a
Gr/(Mo-W)Se$_2$ heterostructure with a lateral interface in the TMDC layer can
indeed host topologically protected in-gap propagating modes, similar to those
at the border of commensurate AB and BA domains in biased minimally-twisted
bilayer graphene. However, the stability of these modes depends crucially on
the system size. We demonstrate that the electronic behaviour of
Gr/(Mo-W)Se$_2$ heterostructures evolves from a homogeneous effective medium to
a superposition of domain-localised bands and zero-energy branch crossings as
the domain size in the alloyed TMDC layer is increased.

<h3>Selective thermal evolution of native oxide layer in Nb and Nb3Sn-coated  SRF grade Nb: An in-situ angular XPS study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06112</a>
<br>
<i>Arely Cano, Grigory V. Eremeev, Juan R. Zuazo, Jaeyel Lee, Bing Luo, Martina Martinello, Alexander Romanenko, Sam Posen</i>
<br>
<br>
This contribution discusses the results of an in-situ angular XPS study on
the thermal evolution of the native oxide layer on Nb3Sn and pure Nb. XPS data
were recorded with conventional spectrometers using an AlK(alpha) X-ray source
for spectra collected up to 600 C, and an MgK(Alpha) X-rays source for
temperatures above 600 C. The effect of the thickness, composition, and thermal
stability of that oxide layer is relevant to understanding the functional
properties of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities used in particle
accelerators. There is a consensus that oxide plays a role in surface
resistance (Rs). The focus of this study is Nb3Sn, which is a promising
material that is used in the manufacturing of superconducting radiofrequency
(SRF) cavities as well as in quantum sensing, and pure Nb, which was included
in the study for comparison. The thermal evolution of the oxide layer in these
two materials is found to be quite different, which is ascribed to the
influence of the Sn atom on the reactivity of the Nb atom in Nb3Sn films. Nb
and Sn atoms in this intermetallic solid have different electronegativity, and
the Sn atom can reduce electron density around neighbouring Nb atoms in the
solid, thus reducing their reactivity for oxygen. This is shown in the
thickness, composition, and thermal stability of the oxide layer formed on
Nb3Sn. The XPS spectra were complemented by grazing incident XRD patterns
collected using the ESRF synchrotron radiation facility. The results discussed
herein shed light on oxide evolution in the Nb3Sn compound and guide its
processing for potential applications of the Nb3Sn-based SRF cavities in
accelerators and other superconducting devices.

The ultimate goal of this research proposal is the creation of a
micro-optomechanical intelligence. The proposal centers on the development and
investigation of very large-scale integrated (VLSI) arrays of coupled M/NEMS
devices as platforms for the experimental study of nonlinear dynamics of
high-dimensional systems. The potential of VLSI M/NEMS arrays to function as
advanced sensors will be demonstrated through the novel idea of a MEMS EYE, an
electronics-free platform that combines imaging and pattern recognition
functionality.

<h3>Dynamics of packed swarms: time-displaced correlators of two dimensional  incompressible flocks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06139</a>

<br>

We analytically calculate the scaling exponents of a two-dimensional KPZ-like
system: coherently moving incompressible polar active fluids. Using three
different renormalization group approximation schemes, we obtain values for the
``roughness" exponent $\chi$ and anisotropy exponent $\zeta$ that are extremely
near the known exact results. This implies our prediction for the previously
completely unknown dynamic exponent $z$ is quantitatively accurate.

<h3>Evidence of Weyl Fermion Enhanced Thermal Conductivity Under Magnetic  Fields in Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator Mn(Bi(1-x)Sb(x))2Te4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06154</a>
<br>
<i>Robert A. Robinson, Seng Huat Lee, Lujin Min, Jinliang Ning, Jianwei Sun, Zhiqiang Mao</i>
<br>
<br>
We report thermal conductivity and Seebeck effect measurements on
Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST) with x = 0.26 under applied magnetic fields below 50 K.
Our data shows clear indications of the electronic structure transition induced
by the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition driven by
applied magnetic field as well as significant positive magnetothermal
conductivity in the Weyl semimetal state of MBST. Further, by examining the
dependence of magnetothermal conductivity on field orientation for MBST and
comparison with the magnetothermal conductivity of MnBi2Te4 we see evidence of
a contribution to thermal conductivity due to Weyl fermions in the FM phase of
MBST. From the temperature dependence of Seebeck coefficient under magnetic
fields for MBST, we also observed features consistent with the Fermi surface
evolution from a hole pocket in the paramagnetic state to a Fermi surface with
coexistence of electron and hole pockets in the FM state. These findings
provide further evidence for the field-driven topological phase transition from
an AFM topological insulator to a FM Weyl semimetal.

<h3>Dimerisation, electronic structure, and magnetic properties in  Ba$_6$Cr$_2$S$_{10}$ compounds: First principles studies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06156" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06156</a>
<br>
<i>Jianfeng Zhang, Hunching Yang, Wei Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Quasi-one-dimensional systems are fascinating as they can exhibit very rich
and interesting physics. The spin chain compound Ba$_6$Cr$_2$S$_{10}$ has been
synthesised experimentally under extreme conditions recently, which has shown
interesting magnetic and toroidal properties due to dimerisation. Here we have
performed first principles calculations to compute the electronic structure and
magnetic properties of Ba$_6$Cr$_2$S$_{10}$, which are consistent with the
experimental results for the magnetic structure and properties shown in [Zhang,
et al, Adv. Mat. 34 (12), 2106728 (2022)]. Moreover, based on our calculations,
we can find more interesting physics, including (i) the small size of the
Hubbard $U$ parameter that implies the screening effect of surrounding Ba
atoms, (ii) the dimerisation of Cr atoms mainly induced by the sulfur ligands,
and (iii) the next-nearest-neighbouring anti-ferromagnetic interaction along
the spin chain, which could bring forward spin frustration, thus spin liquid.

<h3>Potential Major Improvement in Superconductors for High-Field Magnets</h3>

Fusion reactors are limited by the magnetic field available to confine their
plasma. The commercial fusion industry uses the larger magnetic field and
higher operating temperature of the cuprate superconductor
$\mathbf{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$ (YBCO) in order to confine their plasma
into a dense volume. A superconductor is a macroscopic quantum state that is
protected from the metallic (resistive) state by an energy gap. Unfortunately,
YBCO has an anisotropic gap, known as D-wave because it has the shape of a
$\mathbf{d_{x^2-y^2}}$ chemical orbital. This D-wave gap means that
poly-crystalline wire cannot be made because a few degree misalignment between
grains in the wire leads to a drastic loss in its supercurrent carrying
ability, and thereby its magnetic field limit. The superconductor industry has
responded by growing nearly-single-crystal superconducting YBCO films on
carefully prepared substrate tapes kilometers in length. Heroic development
programs have made such tapes commercially available, but they are very
expensive and delicate. MRI magnet superconductors, such as $\mathbf{NbTi}$ and
$\mathbf{Nb_{3}Sn}$, are formed into poly-crystalline wires because they have
an isotropic gap in the shape of an s chemical orbital (called S-wave) that
makes them insensitive to grain misalignment. However, these materials are
limited to lower magnetic fields and liquid-He temperatures. Here, we modified
YBCO by doping the Y site with Ca and Ce atoms to form
$\mathbf{(Y_{1-x-y}Ca_{x}Ce_{y})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$, and show evidence
that it changes to an S-wave gap. Its superconducting transition temperature,
$\mathbf{T_c}$, of $\mathbf{\sim 70K}$, while lower than that of D-wave YBCO at
$\mathbf{\sim 90K}$, is easily maintained using common, economic cryogenic
equipment.

<h3>Optimizing persistent currents in a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate  using machine learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06199</a>
<br>
<i>Simeon Simjanovski, Guillaume Gauthier, Matthew J. Davis, Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop, Tyler W. Neely</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a method for generating persistent currents in Bose-Einstein
condensates by using a Gaussian process learner to experimentally control the
stirring of the superfluid. The learner optimizes four different outcomes of
the stirring process: (O.I) targeting and (O.II) maximization of the persistent
current winding number; and (O.III) targeting and (O.IV) maximization with time
constraints. The learner optimizations are determined based on the achieved
winding number and the number of spurious vortices introduced by stirring. We
find that the learner is successful in optimizing the stirring protocols,
although the optimal stirring profiles vary significantly depending strongly on
the choice of cost function and scenario. These results suggest that stirring
is robust and persistent currents can be reliably generated through a variety
of stirring approaches.

<h3>Vortex nucleation in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates with  density-dependent gauge potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06208" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06208</a>
<br>
<i>Ishfaq Ahmad Bhat, Thudiyangal Mithun, Bishwajyoti Dey</i>
<br>
<br>
We study numerically the vortex dynamics and vortex-lattice formation in a
rotating density-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), characterized by the
presence of nonlinear rotation. By varying the strength of nonlinear rotation
in density-dependent BECs, we calculate the critical frequency,
$\Omega_{\text{cr}}$, for vortex nucleation both in adiabatic and sudden
external trap rotations. The nonlinear rotation modifies the extent of
deformation experienced by the BEC due to the trap and shifts the
$\Omega_{\text{cr}}$ values for vortex nucleation. The critical frequencies and
thereby, the transition to vortex-lattices in an adiabatic rotation ramp,
depend on conventional $\textit{s}$-wave scattering lengths through the
strength of nonlinear rotation, $\mathit{C}$, such that
$\Omega_{\text{cr}}(\mathit{C}>0) < \Omega_{\text{cr}}(\mathit{C}=0) <
\Omega_{\text{cr}}(\mathit{C}<0)$. In an analogous manner, the critical
ellipticity ($\epsilon_{\text{cr}}$) for vortex nucleation during an adiabatic
introduction of trap ellipticity ($\epsilon$) depends on the nature of
nonlinear rotation besides trap rotation frequency. The nonlinear rotation
additionally affects the vortex-vortex interactions and the motion of the
vortices through the condensate by altering the strength of Magnus force on
them. The combined result of these nonlinear effects is the formation of the
non-Abrikosov vortex-lattices and ring-vortex arrangements in the
density-dependent BECs.

<h3>Irrelevant corrections at the quantum Hall transition</h3>

<br>

The quantum Hall effect is one of the most extensively studied topological
effects in solid state physics. The transitions between different quantum Hall
states exhibit critical phenomena described by universal critical exponents.
Numerous numerical finite size scaling studies have focused on the critical
exponent $\nu$ for the correlation length. In such studies it is important to
take proper account of irrelevant corrections to scaling. Recently, Dresselhaus
et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 026801(2022)] proposed a new scaling
ansatz, which they applied to the two terminal conductance of the
Chalker-Coddington model. In this paper their proposal is applied to our
previously reported data for the Lyapunov exponents of that model using both
polynomial fitting and Gaussian process fitting.

<h3>Magnetism in twisted triangular bilayer graphene quantum dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06228" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06228</a>
<br>
<i>M. Mirzakhani, H. C. Park, F. M. Peeters, D. R. da Costa</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a tight-binding model along with the mean-field Hubbard method, we
investigate the effect of twisting angle on the magnetic properties of twisted
bilayer graphene (tBLG) quantum dots (QDs) with triangular shape and zigzag
edges. We consider such QDs in two configurations: when their initial untwisted
structure is a perfect AA- or AB-stacked BLG, referred to as AA- or AB-like
dots. We find that AA-like dots exhibit an antiferromagnetic spin polarization
for small twist angles, which transits to a ferromagnetic spin polarization
beyond a critical twisting angle $\theta_c$. Our analysis shows that $\theta_c$
decreases as the dot size increases, obeying a criterion, according to which
once the maximum energy difference between electron and hole edge states (in
the single-particle picture) is less than $(U / \gamma_0)\, t_0$, the
spin-polarized energy levels are aligned ferromagnetically [$U$ is the Hubbard
parameter and $\gamma_0$ ($t_0$) the graphene intralayer (interlayer) hopping].
Unlike AA-like dots, AB-like dots exhibit finite magnetization for any twist
angle. Furthermore, in the ferromagnetic polarization state, the ground net
spin for both dot configurations agrees with prediction from Lieb's theorem.

<h3>Mitigation of Nitrogen Vacancy Ionization from Material Integration for  Quantum Sensing</h3>

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond has demonstrated great
promise in a wide range of quantum sensing. Recently, there have been a series
of proposals and experiments using NV centers to detect spin noise of quantum
materials near the diamond surface. This is a rich complex area of study with
novel nano-magnetism and electronic behavior, that the NV center would be ideal
for sensing. However, due to the electronic properties of the NV itself and its
host material, getting high quality NV centers within nanometers of such
systems is challenging. Band bending caused by space charges formed at the
metal-semiconductor interface force the NV center into its insensitive charge
states. Here, we investigate optimizing this interface by depositing thin metal
films and thin insulating layers on a series of NV ensembles at different
depths to characterize the impact of metal films on different ensemble depths.
We find an improvement of coherence and dephasing times we attribute to
ionization of other paramagnetic defects. The insulating layer of alumina
between the metal and diamond provide improved photoluminescence and higher
sensitivity in all modes of sensing as compared to direct contact with the
metal, providing as much as a factor of 2 increase in sensitivity, decrease of
integration time by a factor of 4, for NV $T_1$ relaxometry measurements.

<h3>High-performance descriptor for magnetic materials:Accurate  discrimination of magnetic symmetries</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetic structure is crucial in determining the physical properties
inherent in magnetic compounds. We present an adequate descriptor for magnetic
structure with proper magnetic symmetry and high discrimination performance,
which does not depend on artificial choices for coordinate origin, axis, and
magnetic unit cell in crystal. We extend the formalism called ``smooth overlap
of atomic positions'' (SOAP) providing a numerical representation of atomic
configurations to that of magnetic moment configurations. We introduce the
descriptor in terms of the vector spherical harmonics to describe a magnetic
moment configuration and partial spectra from the expansion coefficients. We
discuss that the lowest order partial spectrum is insufficient to discriminate
the magnetic structures with different magnetic anisotropy, and a higher order
partial spectrum is required in general to characterize detailed magnetic
structures on the same atomic configuration. We then introduce the fourth-order
partial spectrum and evaluate the discrimination performance for different
magnetic structures, mainly focusing on the difference in magnetic symmetry.
The modified partial spectra that are defined not to reflect the difference of
magnetic anisotropy are also useful in evaluating magnetic structures obtained
from first-principles calculations without spin-orbit coupling. We apply the
present method to the symmetry-classified magnetic structures for the crystals
of Mn$_3$Ir and Mn$_3$Sn, which are known to exhibit anomalous transport under
the antiferromagnetic order, and examine the discrimination performance of the
descriptor for different magnetic structures on the same crystal.

<h3>Majorana differential shot noise and its universal thermoelectric  crossover</h3>

Nonequilibrium states driven by both electric bias voltages $V$ and
temperature differences $\Delta T$ (or thermal voltages $eV_T\equiv k_B\Delta
T$) are unique probes of various systems. Whereas average currents $I(V,V_T)$
are traditionally measured in majority of experiments, an essential part of
nonequilibrium dynamics, stored particularly in fluctuations, remains largely
unexplored. Here we focus on Majorana quantum dot devices, specifically on
their differential shot noise $\partial S^>(V,V_T)/\partial V$, and demonstrate
that in contrast to the differential electric or thermoelectric conductance,
$\partial I(V,V_T)/\partial V$ or $\partial I(V,V_T)/\partial V_T$, it reveals
a crossover from thermoelectric to pure thermal nonequilibrium behavior. It is
shown that this Majorana crossover in $\partial S^>(V,V_T)/\partial V$ is
induced by an interplay of the electric and thermal driving, occurs at an
energy scale determined by the Majorana tunneling amplitude, and exhibits a
number of universal characteristics which may be accessed in solely noise
experiments or in combination with measurements of average currents.

We investigate the morphologies of the Ge(001) surface that are produced by
bombardment with a normally incident, broad argon ion beam at sample
temperatures above the recrystallization temperature. Two previously-observed
kinds of topographies are seen, i.e., patterns consisting of upright and
inverted rectangular pyramids, as well as patterns composed of shallow,
isotropic basins. In addition, we observe the formation of an unexpected third
type of pattern for intermediate values of the temperature, ion energy and ion
flux. In this type of transitional morphology, isolated peaks with rectangular
cross sections stand above a landscape of shallow, rounded basins. We also
extend past theoretical work to include a second order correction term that
comes from the curvature dependence of the sputter yield. For a range of
parameter values, the resulting continuum model of the surface dynamics
produces patterns that are remarkably similar to the transitional morphologies
we observe in our experiments. The formation of the isolated peaks is the
result of a term that is not ordinarily included in the equation of motion, a
second order correction to the curvature dependence of the sputter yield.

Dynamically tunable nanoengineered structures for coloration show promising
applications in sensing, displays, and communication. However, their potential
challenge remains in having a scalable manufacturing process over large scales
in tens of cm of area. For the first time, we report a novel approach for
fabricating chromogenic nanostructures that respond to mechanical stimuli by
utilizing the fluidic properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a substrate
and the interfacial tension of liquid metal-based plasmonic nanoparticles.
Relying on the PDMS tunable property and a physical deposition method, our
approach is single-step, scalable, and does not rely on high carbon footprint
lithographic processes. By tuning the oligomer content in PDMS, we show that
varieties of structural colors covering a significant gamut in CIE coordinates
are achieved. We develop a model which depicts the formation of Ga nanodroplets
from the capillary interaction of oligomers in PDMS with Ga. We showcase the
capabilities of our processing technique by presenting prototypes of reflective
displays and sensors for monitoring body parts, smart bandages, and the
capacity of the nanostructured film to map force in real time. These examples
illustrate this technology's broad range of applications, such as large-area
displays, devices for human-computer interactions, healthcare, and visual
communication.

Band topology of materials describes the extent Bloch wavefunctions are
twisted in momentum space. Such descriptions rely on a set of topological
invariants, generally referred to as topological charges, which form a
characteristic class in the mathematical structure of fiber bundles associated
with the Bloch wavefunctions. For example, the celebrated Chern number and its
variants belong to the Chern class, characterizing topological charges for
complex Bloch wavefunctions. Nevertheless, under the space-time inversion
symmetry, Bloch wavefunctions can be purely real in the entire momentum space;
consequently, their topological classification does not fall into the Chern
class, but requires another characteristic class known as the Stiefel-Whitney
class. Here, in a three-dimensional acoustic crystal, we demonstrate a
topological nodal-line semimetal that is characterized by a doublet of
topological charges, the first and second Stiefel-Whitney numbers,
simultaneously. Such a doubly charged nodal line gives rise to a doubled
bulk-boundary correspondence: while the first Stiefel-Whitney number induces
ordinary drumhead states of the nodal line, the second Stiefel-Whitney number
supports hinge Fermi arc states at odd inversion-related pairs of hinges. These
results establish the Stiefel-Whitney topological charges as intrinsic
topological invariants for topological materials, with their unique
bulk-boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework of topological
band theory.

<h3>Capacitance characterization of Graphene/n-Si Schottky junction solar  cell with MOS capacitor</h3>

We have demonstrated a simple and accurate method for characterizing the
capacitance of Graphene/n-Si Schottky junction solar cells (GSSCs) which embed
the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. We measured two types of GSSCs,
one with thermal annealing treatments (w-a) and one without (wo-a). It was
found that the wo-a GSSC exhibits a two-step feature in the phase versus
forward bias voltage relationship, which may be attributed to the presence of
polymethyl methacrylate residues. By considering the capacitance of the MOS
capacitor (Cmos) and its standard deviation, we successfully obtained the
capacitance of the Schottky junction (CSch), and evaluated meaningful built-in
potentials (Schottky barrier heights) which are 0.51V (0.78eV) and 0.47V
(0.75eV) for the w-a and wo-a GSSCs, respectively, by the Mott-Schottky
analysis. We also briefly discuss the relationship between CSch and the Nyquist
and Bode plots, finding that the RC time constant decreases due to the
subtraction of Cmos.

The magic angle twisted bilayer systems give rise to many exotic phenomena in
two-dimensional electronic or photonic platforms. Here, we study the twisted
near-field energy radiation between graphene metasurfaces with nonequilibrium
drifted Dirac electrons. Anomalously, we find unconventional radiative flux
that directs heat from cold to hot. This far-from-equilibrium phenomenon leads
to a heating-cooling transition beyond a thermal magic twist angle, facilitated
by twist-induced photonic topological transitions. The underlying mechanism is
related to the spectrum match and mismatch caused by the cooperation between
the non-reciprocal nature of drifted plasmon polaritons and their topological
features. Furthermore, we report the unintuitive distance dependence of
radiative energy flux under large twist angles. The near-field radiation
becomes thermal insulating when increasing to a critical distance, and
subsequently reverses the radiative flux to increase the cooling power as the
distance increases further. Our results indicate the promising future of
nonequilibrium drifted and twisted devices and pave the way towards tunable
radiative thermal management.

<h3>Magnon squeezing in conical spin spirals</h3>

<br>
We investigate squeezing of magnons in a conical spin spiral configuration.
We find that while the energy of magnons propagating along the $\boldsymbol{k}$
and the $-\boldsymbol{k}$ directions can be different due to the non-reciprocal
dispersion, these two modes are connected by the squeezing, hence can be
described by the same squeezing parameter. The squeezing parameter diverges at
the center of the Brillouin zone due to the translational Goldstone mode of the
system, but the squeezing also vanishes for certain wave vectors. We discuss
possible ways of detecting the squeezing.

Spiking neural networks aim to emulate the brain's properties to achieve
similar parallelism and high-processing power. A caveat of these neural
networks is the high computational cost to emulate, while current proposals for
analogue implementations are energy inefficient and not scalable. We propose a
device based on a single magnetic tunnel junction to perform neuron firing for
spiking neural networks without the need of any resetting procedure. We
leverage two physics, magnetism and thermal effects, to obtain a bio-realistic
spiking behavior analogous to the Huxley-Hodgkin model of the neuron. The
device is also able to emulate the simpler Leaky-Integrate and Fire model.
Numerical simulations using experimental-based parameters demonstrate firing
frequency in the MHz to GHz range under constant input at room temperature. The
compactness, scalability, low cost, CMOS-compatibility, and power efficiency of
magnetic tunnel junctions advocate for their broad use in hardware
implementations of spiking neural networks.

Microswimmers are microscopic active agents capable of harvesting energy from
the surrounding environment and converting it into self-propulsion and directed
motion. This peculiar feature characterizes them as out-of-equilibrium systems
that break microscopic reversibility. The problem of finding a specific target
in a complex environment is essential for these agents since it is employed for
a variety of purposes, from foraging nourishment to escaping potential threats.
Here, we provide a detailed study of the target search process for
microswimmers exploring complex environments. To this end, we generalize
Transition Path Theory, the rigorous statistical mechanics description of
transition processes, to the target-search problem. One of the main results of
this thesis is the generalization to non-equilibrium systems of the Transition
Path Sampling (TPS) algorithm, which was originally designed to simulate rare
transitions in passive systems. The TPS algorithm relies on microscopic
reversibility for its functioning, therefore its generalization to
out-of-equilibrium systems lacking detailed balance and microscopic
reversibility has remained a major challenge. Within this work, we generalize
the TPS algorithm to the case of an active Brownian particle, i.e. a
paradigmatic model for microswimmers, and we obtain a first insight into the
counterintuitive target-search pathways explored by these agents. The second
result of this thesis is a systematic characterization of the target-search
path ensemble for an active particle exploring an energy landscape. The third
and final original contribution of this Ph.D. thesis is the generalization of
the concept of the committor function to target-search problems, with a
validation of our theory against experiments of a camphor self-propelled disk.

Optical lattice plays an important role on stability and dynamics of quantum
droplets. In this letter, we investigate the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum of
quantum droplets in optical lattice in the thermodynamic limit. We classify the
collective excitations as synchronous modes, Bloch phononic modes, and
site-density imbalanced modes. For synchronous modes, we measure the dipole
oscillation frequencies by quench dynamics with a sudden shift of the optical
lattice, and the breathing frequencies by Floquet dynamics with a periodic
change of the lattice depth. Bloch phononic modes are observable from the
Landau critical velocity of the droplets. We further discuss the instability
induced by the site-dependent density fluctuations, and calculate the critical
filling of atoms where the growth of lattice vacancy breaks down the
translational symmetry of the system. This work makes essential steps towards
measuring the excitation spectrum and understanding the superfluid nature of
quantum droplets in optical lattice.

Controlling the charge density in low-dimensional materials with an
electrostatic potential is a powerful tool to explore and influence their
electronic and optical properties. Conventional solid gates impose strict
geometrical constraints to the devices and often absorb electromagnetic
radiation in the infrared (IR) region. A powerful alternative is ionic liquid
(IL) gating. This technique only needs a metallic electrode in contact with the
IL and the highest achievable electric field is limited by the electrochemical
interactions of the IL with the environment. Despite the excellent gating
properties, a large number of ILs is hardly exploitable for optical experiments
in the mid-IR region, because they typically suffer from low optical
transparency and degradation in ambient conditions. Here, we report the
realization of two electrolytes based on bromide ILs dissolved in polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA). We demonstrate that such electrolytes can induce
state-of-the-art charge densities as high as $20\times10^{15}\
\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Thanks to the low water absorption of PMMA, they work both
in vacuum and in ambient atmosphere after a simple vacuum curing. Furthermore,
our electrolytes can be spin coated into flat thin films with optical
transparency in the range from 600 cm$^{-1}$ to 4000 cm$^{-1}$. Thanks to these
properties, the electrolytes are excellent candidates to fill the gap as
versatile gating layers for electronic and mid-IR optoelectronic devices.

The control over the self-assembly of complex structures is a long-standing
challenge of material science, especially at the colloidal scale, as the
desired assembly pathway is often kinetically derailed by the formation of
amorphous aggregates. Here we investigate in detail the problem of the
self-assembly of the three Archimedean shells with five contact points per
vertex, i.e. the icosahedron, the snub cube, and the snub dodecahedron. We use
patchy particles with five interaction sites (or patches) as model for the
building blocks, and recast the assembly problem as a Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT) for the patch-patch interactions. This allows us to find
effective designs for all targets, and to selectively suppress unwanted
structures. By tuning the geometrical arrangement and the specific interactions
of the patches, we demonstrate that lowering the symmetry of the building
blocks reduces the number of competing structures, which in turn can
considerably increase the yield of the target structure. These results cement
SAT-assembly as an invaluable tool to solve inverse design problems.

We develop a general classification of the nature of the instabilities
yielding spatial organization in open non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems.
This encompasses dynamics where chemical species diffuse, interact with each
other, and undergo chemical reactions driven out-of-equilibrium by external
chemostats. We find analytically that these instabilities can be of two types:
instabilities caused by molecular interactions (Cahn-Hilliard type), and
instabilities caused by multimolecular out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions
(Turing type). Furthermore, we identify a class of chemical reaction networks,
extending beyond unimolecular networks, that can only undergo Cahn-Hilliard
instabilities. We illustrate our analytical findings with numerical simulations
on two reaction-diffusion models, each displaying one of the two types of
instability.

The Mpemba effect refers to the anomalous relaxation phenomenon wherein an
initially hotter system equilibrates faster than an initially colder system
when both are quenched to the same low temperature. Experiments on a single
colloidal particle trapped in a carefully shaped double well potential have
demonstrated the effect. In this paper, we present an exact analysis, based on
the eigenspectrum analysis of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, of the
Mpemba effect in such systems by considering a piece-wise linear double well
potential. The role of metastable states in the energy landscape as well as the
initial distribution of the population of the particle in its confined domain
is discussed. We also show that a metastable state is not a necessary condition
for the Mpemba effect.

<br>
Self-doping can not only suppress the photogenerated charge recombination of
semiconducting quantum dots by self-introducing trapping states within the
bandgap, but also provide high-density catalytic active sites as the
consequence of abundant non-saturated bonds associated with the defects. Here,
we successfully prepared semiconducting copper selenide (CuSe) confined quantum
dots with abundant vacancies and systematically investigated their
photoelectrochemical characteristics. Photoluminescence characterizations
reveal that the presence of vacancies reduces the emission intensity
dramatically, indicating a low recombination rate of photogenerated charge
carriers due to the self-introduced trapping states within the bandgap. In
addition, the ultra-low charge transfer resistance measured by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy implies the efficient charge transfer of CuSe
semiconducting quantum dots-based photoelectrocatalysts, which is guaranteed by
the high conductivity of their confined structure as revealed by
room-temperature electrical transport measurements. Such high conductivity and
low photogenerated charge carriers recombination rate, combined with
high-density active sites and confined structure, guaranteeing the remarkable
photoelectrocatalytic performance and stability as manifested by
photoelectrocatalysis characterizations. This work promotes the development of
semiconducting quantum dots-based photoelectrocatalysis and demonstrates CuSe
semiconducting quantum confined catalysts as an advanced photoelectrocatalysts
for oxygen evolution reaction.

RE-Ba-Cu-O (RE denotes rare earth elements) single-grain superconductors have
garnered considerable attention owning to their ability to trap strong magnetic
field and self-stability for maglev. Here, we employed a modified melt-growth
method by adding liquid source (LS) to provide a liquid rich environment during
crystal growth. It further enables a significantly low maximum processing
temperature (Tmax) even approaching peritectic decomposition temperature. This
method was referred as the liquid source rich low Tmax (LS+LTmax) growth method
which combines the advantage of Top Seeded Infiltration Growth (TSIG) into Top
Seeded Melt-texture Growth (TSMG). The LS+LTmax method synergistically
regulates the perfect appearance and high superconducting performance in REBCO
single grains. The complementary role of liquid source and low Tmax on the
crystallization has been carefully investigated. Microstructure analysis
demonstrates that the LS+LTmax processed GdBCO single grains show clear
advantages of uniform distribution of RE3+ ions as well as RE211 particles. The
inhibition of Gd211 coarsening leads to improved pining properties. GdBCO
single-grain superconductors with diameter of 18 mm and 25 mm show maximum
trapped magnetic field of 0.746 T and 1.140 T at 77 K. These trapped fields are
significantly higher than those of conventional TSMG samples. Particularly, at
grain boundaries with reduced RE211 density superior flux pinning performance
has been observed. It indicates the existence of multiple pinning mechanisms at
these areas. The presented strategy provides essential LS+LTmax technology for
processing high performance single-grain superconductors with improved
reliability which is considered important for engineering applications.

Charge density wave (CDW) orders in vanadium-based kagome metals have
recently received tremendous attention due to their unique properties and
intricate interplay with exotic correlated phenomena, topological and
symmetry-breaking states. However, the origin of the CDW order remains a topic
of debate. The discovery of ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$, a vanadium-based bilayer kagome
metal exhibiting an in-plane $\sqrt{3}$ x $\sqrt{3} $ $\textit{R}$30${\deg}$
CDW order with time-reversal symmetry breaking, provides a novel platform to
explore the underlying mechanism behind the unconventional CDW. Here, we
combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, Raman
scattering measurements and density functional theory to investigate the
electronic structures and phonon modes of ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ and their evolution
with temperature. We identify topologically nontrivial Dirac surface states and
multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the vicinity of the Fermi level, with
one VHS near the K point exhibiting nesting wave vectors in proximity to the
$\sqrt{3}$ x $\sqrt{3}$ $\textit{R}$30${\deg}$ CDW wave vector. Additionally,
Raman measurements indicate a strong intrinsic electron-phonon coupling in
ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$, as evidenced by the presence of a two-phonon mode and a
large frequency amplitude mode. Our findings highlight the fundamental role of
lattice degrees of freedom in promoting the CDW in ScV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ and
provide important insights into the fascinating correlation phenomena observed

Charge ordered kagome lattices have been demonstrated to be intriguing
platforms for studying the intertwining of topology, correlation, and
magnetism. The recently discovered charge ordered kagome material ScV_6Sn_6
does not feature a magnetic groundstate or excitations, thus it is often
regarded as a conventional paramagnet. Here, using advanced muon-spin rotation
spectroscopy, we uncover an unexpected hidden magnetism of the charge order. We
observe a striking enhancement of the internal field width sensed by the muon
ensemble, which takes place within the charge ordered state. More remarkably,
the muon spin relaxation rate below the charge ordering temperature is
substantially enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. Taken together
with the hidden magnetism found in AV_3Sb_5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) and FeGe kagome
systems, our results suggest ubiqitous time-reversal symmetry-breaking in
charge ordered kagome lattices.

Diamond displays outstanding chemical, physical, and tribological properties,
making it attractive for numerous applications ranging from biomedicine to
tribology. However, the reaction of the materials with molecules present in the
air, such as oxygen, hydrogen, and water, could significantly change the
electronic and tribological properties of the films. In this study, we
performed several density functional theory calculations to construct a
database for the adsorption energies and dissociation barriers of these
molecules on the most relevant diamond surfaces, including C(111), C(001), and
C(110). The adsorption configurations, reaction paths, activation energies, and
their influence on the structure of diamond surfaces are discussed. The results
indicate that there is a strong correlation between adsorption energy and
surface energy. Moreover, we found that the dissociation processes of oxygen
molecules on these diamond surfaces can significantly alter the surface
morphology and may affect the tribological properties of diamond films. These
findings can help to advance the development and optimization of devices and
antiwear coatings based on diamond.

Ascertainment of the nature of the slow relaxation processes observed after
melting in glass-forming eutectic melts is the subject of this work. We claim
that the diffusion processes nonlinearity in heterogeneous melt with inclusions
of refractory stoichiometry is the origin of this phenomenon. The cause for
this nonlinearity is the thermodynamic instability similar to one taking place
at spinodal decomposition, and indispensable condition is the initially
non-homogenous. For confirmation of our devotes, we consider the model of
liquid solution of a binary system, which evolution described by the
Cahn-Hilliard equation with combined Gibbs potential assuming the presence of
remains after melting stoichiometric phase. Exemplified by the Al-Y and Al-Yb
alloys, using Gibbs potentials from a standard database we show that subject to
initial heterogeneity in these systems the instability can develop leading to
the slow relaxation processes, and determine the regions of this instability in
the phase diagrams.

We theoretically investigate a novel supersolid structure taking the form of
stacked, disk-shaped superfluid droplets connected via a dilute superfluid, in
an antidipolar condensate. A phase diagram is determined for varying the
particle number and scattering length, identifying the regions of a regular
dipolar superfluid, supersolid stacks, and isolated stacked disk-shaped
droplets in an experimentally realizable trapping potential. The collective
Bogoliubov excitation spectrum across the superfluid-supersolid phase
transition is studied, and the transition point is found to be associated with
the breaking of the degeneracy of the two lowest-lying modes. The dynamical
generation of the supersolid stacks is also investigated by ramping down the
scattering length across the phase transition. Moreover, we have studied the
impact of vortex-line penetration on the phase transition. We have found that
the presence of a vortex line causes the supersolid region to move towards
weaker contact interactions. Our detailed numerical simulations highlight that
an antidipolar condensate can create such supersolid stacks within an
experimentally reachable parameter regime.

properties of SmCo$_{5}$ thin films synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy. A
series of thin films with varying concentrations of Cu were grown under
otherwise identical conditions to disentangle structural and compositional
effects on the magnetic behavior. The combined experimental and theoretical
studies show that Cu substitution at the Co$_{3g}$ sites not only stabilizes
the formation of the SmCo$_{5}$ structure but enhances magnetic anisotropy and
coercivity. Density functional theory calculations indicate that
Sm(Co$_4$Cu$_{3g}$)$_5$ possesses a higher single-ion anisotropy as compared to
pure SmCo$_{5}$. In addition, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals that Cu
substitution causes an increasing decoupling of the Sm 4\textit{f} and Co
3\textit{d} moments. Scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms
predominantly SmCo$_{5}$ phase formation and reveals nanoscale inhomogeneities
in the Cu and Co distribution. Our study based on thin film model systems and
advanced characterization as well as modeling reveals novel aspects of the
complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to magnetic
hysteresis in rare earth-based magnets, \textit{i.e.} the combination of
increased intrinsic anisotropy due to Cu substitution and the extrinsic effect
of inhomogeneous elemental distribution of Cu and Co.

<h3>Importance of the catalytic effect of the substrate in the functionality  of lubricant additives: the case of MoDTC</h3>

Molybdenum dithiocarbamates (MoDTCs) are lubricant additives very efficient
in reducing the friction of steel and they are employed in a number of
industrial applications. The functionality of these additives is ruled by the
chemical interactions occurring at the buried sliding interface, which are of
key importance for the improvement of the lubrication performance. Yet, these
tribochemical processes are very difficult to monitor in real time. Ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations are the ideal tool to shed light into such a
complicated reactivity. In this work we perform ab initio simulations, both in
static and tribological conditions, to understand the effect of surface
oxidation on the tribochemical reactivity of MoDTC and we find that when the
surfaces are covered by oxygen, the first dissociative steps of the additives
are significantly hindered. Our preliminary tribological tests on oxidized
steel discs support these results. Bare metallic surfaces are necessary for a
stable adsorption of the additives, their quick decomposition, and the
formation of a durable MoS$_2$ tribolayer. This work demonstrates the
importance of the catalytic role of the substrate and confirms the full
capability of the computational protocol in the pursuit of materials and
compounds more efficient in reducing friction.

In the pursuit of sustainable lubricant materials, the conversion of common
organic molecules into graphitic material has been recently shown to
effectively reduce friction of metallic interfaces. Aromatic molecules are
perfect candidates due to their inertness and possibility to form carbon-based
tribofilms. Among many promising possibilities, we selected a group of common
aromatic compounds and we investigated their capability to reduce the adhesion
of iron interface. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations of the sliding
interface show that hypericin, a component of St. John's wort, effectively
separates the mating iron surfaces better than graphene. This phenomenon is due
to the size of the molecule, the reactivity of the moieties at its edges and
the possibility to stack several of these structures that can easily slide on
top of each other. The decomposition of the lateral groups of hypericin
observed in the dynamic simulations suggests that the clustering of several
molecules is possible, offering innovative paths to lubricate sliding contacts
with compounds not typically employed in tribology.

In the rapidly expanding field of two-dimensional materials, magnetic
monolayers show great promise for the future applications in nanoelectronics,
data storage, and sensing. The research in intrinsically magnetic
two-dimensional materials mainly focuses on synthetic iodide and telluride
based compounds, which inherently suffer from the lack of ambient stability. So
far, naturally occurring layered magnetic materials have been vastly
overlooked. These minerals offer a unique opportunity to explore air-stable
complex layered systems with high concentration of local moment bearing ions.
We demonstrate magnetic ordering in iron-rich two-dimensional phyllosilicates,
focusing on mineral species of minnesotaite, annite, and biotite. These are
naturally occurring van der Waals magnetic materials which integrate local
moment baring ions of iron via magnesium/aluminium substitution in their
octahedral sites. Due to self-inherent capping by silicate/aluminate
tetrahedral groups, ultra-thin layers are air-stable. Chemical
characterization, quantitative elemental analysis, and iron oxidation states
were determined via Raman spectroscopy, wavelength disperse X-ray spectroscopy,
X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry measurements were
performed to examine the magnetic ordering. These layered materials exhibit
paramagnetic or superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature. At low
temperature ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering occurs, with the
critical ordering temperature of 38.7 K for minnesotaite, 36.1 K for annite,
and 4.9 K for biotite. In-field magnetic force microscopy on iron bearing
phyllosilicates confirmed the paramagnetic response at room temperature,
present down to monolayers.

<h3>Theoretical study of the competition between folding and contact  interactions on the properties of polymers using self-avoid random walk  algorithm</h3>

<br>
<br>
The self-avoid random walk algorithm has been extensively used in the study
of polymers. In this work we study the basic properties of the trajectories
generated with this algorithm when two interactions are added to it: contact
and folding interaction. These interactions represent the internal forces of
the polymer as well as the effect of the solvent. When independently added to
the algorithm, the contact interaction creates the compact phase while the
folding one creates the extended phase. These are the consequences of the
typical event of each interaction. On the other hand, when this typical event
is avoided there is no established phase on the system. When simultaneously
added, there is a competition between the interactions and the folding one is
dominant over the contact one. The resulting phase is always the extended one
with and without the contact interaction.

Diamond-based coatings are employed in several technological applications,
for their outstanding mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and chemical
stability. Of significant relevance is the interface with silicon oxide, where
phenomena of adhesion, friction, and wear can affect drastically the
performance of the coating. Here we monitor such phenomena in real-time by
performing massive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in tribological
conditions. We take into account many relevant factors that can play a role,
i.e. the diamond surface orientation and reconstruction, silanol density, as
well as, the type and concentration of passivating species. The large systems
size and the long simulations time, put our work at the frontier of what can be
currently done with fully ab initio molecular dynamics. The results of our work
point to full hydrogenation as an effective way to reduce both friction and
wear for all diamond surfaces, while graphitization is competitive only on the
(111) surface. Overall we expect that our observations will be useful to
improve technological applications where the silica-diamond interface plays a
key role. Moreover, we demonstrate that realistic and accurate in silico
experiments are feasible nowadays exploiting HPC resources and HPC optimized
software, paving the way to a more general understanding of the relationship
between surface chemistry and nanoscale-tribology.

What defines the lifetime of electronic states in artificial quantum
structures? We measured the spectral widths of resonant eigenstates in a
circular, CO-based quantum corral on a Cu(111) surface and found that the
widths are related to the size of the corral and that the line shape is
essentially Gaussian. A model linking the energy dependence with the movement
of single surface electrons shows that the observed behavior is consistent with
lifetime limitations due to interaction with the corral walls.

<h3>Optimum transport in systems with time-dependent drive and short-ranged  interactions</h3>

We study one-dimensional hardcore lattice gases, with nearest-neighbor
interactions, in the presence of an external potential barrier, that moves on
the periodic lattice with a constant speed. We investigate how the nature of
the interaction (attractive or repulsive) affects particle transport and
determine, using numerical simulations and mean-field calculations, the
conditions for an optimum transport in the system. Physically, the particle
current induced by the time-dependent potential is opposed by a diffusive
current generated by the density inhomogeneity (a traveling wave) built up in
the system, resulting in a current reversal, that crucially depends on the
speed of the barrier and particle-number density. Indeed the presence of
nearest-neighbor interaction has a significant impact on the current: Repulsive
interaction enhances the current, whereas attractive interaction suppresses it
considerably. Quite remarkably, when the number density is low, the current
increases with the strength of the repulsive interaction and the maximum
current is obtained for the strongest possible repulsion strength, i.e., for
the nearest-neighbor exclusion. However, at high density, very strong repulsion
makes particle movement difficult in an overcrowded environment and, in that
case, the maximal current is achieved for weaker repulsive interaction
strength.

The exploitation of spin Berry phases to generate emergent fields for
producing miniaturized and high-quality inductors has enjoyed considerable
popularity among proponents of quantum technologies [Nature 586, 202 (2020)}].
Inspired by this breakthrough, we extend its mechanism to spin thermoelectrics
by probing responses of ferrimagnetic domain walls (DWs) to thermal gradients.
Similarly, voltages here stem from DW-spin collective motion, in contrast to
normal electron transport phenomena. We further develop finite-temperature
dynamics to investigate thermoelectric figures of merit and attribute
corresponding quantum superiority to ultrafast spin evolution of ferrimagnetism
with tunable non-Abelian phases. We propose a more likely cause of DW motion
towards hot or cold regions (contrary to conclusions of previous reports) and
verify existence of efficient magnon-momentum transfers. These findings deepen
our understanding of heat-driven DW kinetics and suggest profitable new
directions in an emerging realm of spincaloritronics.

We show that a lattice mode of arbitrary symmetry induces a well-defined
macroscopic polarization at first order in the momentum and second order in the
amplitude. We identify a symmetric flexoelectric-like contribution, which is
sensitive to both the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions, and an
antisymmetric Dzialoshinskii-Moriya-like term, which is unaffected by either.
We develop the first-principles methodology to compute the relevant coupling
tensors in an arbitrary crystal, which we illustrate with the example of the
antiferrodistortive order parameter in SrTiO$_3$.

Artificial networks have been studied through the prism of statistical
mechanics as disordered systems since the 80s, starting from the simple models
of Hopfield's associative memory and the single-neuron perceptron classifier.
Assuming data is generated by a teacher model, asymptotic generalisation
predictions were originally derived using the replica method and the online
learning dynamics has been described in the large system limit. In this
chapter, we review the key original ideas of this literature along with their
heritage in the ongoing quest to understand the efficiency of modern deep
learning algorithms. One goal of current and future research is to characterize
the bias of the learning algorithms toward well-generalising minima in a
complex overparametrized loss landscapes with many solutions perfectly
interpolating the training data. Works on perceptrons, two-layer committee
machines and kernel-like learning machines shed light on these benefits of
overparametrization. Another goal is to understand the advantage of depth while
models now commonly feature tens or hundreds of layers. If replica computations
apparently fall short in describing general deep neural networks learning,
studies of simplified linear or untrained models, as well as the derivation of
scaling laws provide the first elements of answers.

We show that pressure applied to twisted WSe$_2$ can enhance the many-body
gap and region of stability of a fractional Chern insulator at filling $\nu =
1/3$. Our results are based on exact diagonalization of a continuum model,
whose pressure-dependence is obtained through {\it ab initio} methods. We
interpret our results in terms of a {\it magic line} in the pressure-{\it
vs}-twist angle phase diagram: along the magic line, the bandwidth of the
topmost moir\'e valence band is minimized while simultaneously its quantum
geometry nearly resembles that of an ideal Chern band. We expect our results to
generalize to other twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers.

In this work, we resolve conflicting experimental and theoretical findings
related to the dynamical stability and superconducting properties of
$Fm\overline{3}m$-LuH$_3$, which, according to Dasenbrock-Gammon \textit{et
al.}~[Nature 615, 244 (2023)], is the parent phase harboring room-temperature
superconductivity at near-ambient pressures. Including temperature and quantum
anharmonic lattice effects in our calculations, we demonstrate that the
theoretically predicted structural instability of the $Fm\overline{3}m$ phase
near ambient pressures is suppressed for temperatures above $200\,\text{K}$. We
provide a $p$--$T$ phase diagram for stability up to pressures of
$6\,\text{GPa}$, where the required temperature for stability is reduced to
$T>80\,\text{K}$. We also determine the superconducting critical temperature
$T_\text{c}$ of $Fm\overline{3}m$-LuH$_3$ within the Migdal-Eliashberg
formalism, using temperature- and quantum-anharmonically-corrected phonon
dispersions, finding that the expected $T_\text{c}$ for electron-phonon
mediated superconductivity is in the range of $50$--$60\,\text{K}$, i.e., well
below the temperatures required to stabilize the lattice. When taking into
account moderate doping based on rigidly shifting the Fermi level, $T_\text{c}$
decreases for both hole and electron doping. Our results thus provide evidence
that any observed room-temperature superconductivity in pure or doped
$Fm\overline{3}m$-LuH$_3$, if confirmed, cannot be explained by a conventional
electron-phonon mediated pairing mechanism.

Interfacial charge transfer in oxide heterostructures gives rise to a rich
variety of electronic and magnetic phenomena. Designing heterostructures where
one of the thin-film components exhibits a metal-insulator transition opens a
promising avenue for controlling such phenomena both statically and
dynamically. In this letter, we utilize a combination of depth-resolved soft
X-ray standing-wave and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies in conjunction
with polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the
effects of the metal-insulator transition in $LaNiO_{3}$ on the electronic and
magnetic states at the $LaNiO_{3}/CaMnO_{3}$ interface. We report on a direct
observation of the reduced effective valence state of the interfacial Mn
cations in the metallic superlattice with an above-critical $LaNiO_{3}$
thickness (6 u.c.) due to the leakage of itinerant Ni 3d $e_{g}$ electrons into
the interfacial $CaMnO_{3}$ layer. Conversely, in an insulating superlattice
with a below-critical $LaNiO_{3}$ thickness of 2 u.c., a homogeneous effective
valence state of Mn is observed throughout the $CaMnO_{3}$ layers due to the
blockage of charge transfer across the interface. The ability to switch and
tune interfacial charge transfer enables precise control of the emergent
ferromagnetic state at the $LaNiO_{3}/CaMnO_{3}$ interface and, thus, has
far-reaching consequences on the future strategies for the design of
next-generation spintronic devices.

<h3>Topological enhancement of non-normality in non-Hermitian skin effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
The non-Hermitian skin effects are representative phenomena intrinsic to
non-Hermitian systems: the energy spectra and eigenstates under the open
boundary condition (OBC) drastically differ from those under the periodic
boundary condition (PBC). Whereas a non-trivial topology under the PBC
characterizes the non-Hermitian skin effects, their proper measure under the
OBC has not been clarified yet. This paper reveals that topological enhancement
of non-normality under the OBC accurately quantifies the non-Hermitian skin
effects. Correspondingly to spectrum and state changes of the skin effects, we
introduce two scalar measures of non-normality and argue that the non-Hermitian
skin effects enhance both macroscopically under the OBC. We also show that the
enhanced non-normality correctly describes phase transitions causing the
non-Hermitian skin effects and reveals the absence of non-Hermitian skin
effects protected by average symmetry. The topological enhancement of
non-normality governs the perturbation sensitivity of the OBC spectra and the
anomalous time-evolution dynamics through the Bauer-Fike theorem.

Molecular motors fulfill critical functions within all living beings.
Understanding their underlying working principles is therefore of great
interest. Here we develop a simple model inspired by the two-component
biomolecular motor Fo-F1 ATP synthase. We analyze its energetics and
characterize information flows between the machine's components. At maximum
output power we find that information transduction plays a minor role for
free-energy transduction. However, when the two components are coupled to
different environments (e.g., when in contact with heat baths at different
temperatures), we show that information flow becomes a resource worth
exploiting to maximize free-energy transduction. Our findings suggest that
real-world powerful and efficient information engines could be found in
machines whose components are subjected to fluctuations of different strength,
since in this situation the benefit gained from using information for work
extraction can outweigh the costs of information generation.

<br>
<br>
Bilayers consisting of two-dimensional (2D) electron and hole gases separated
by a 10 nm thick AlGaAs barrier are formed by charge accumulation in
epitaxially grown GaAs. Both vertical and lateral electric transport are
measured in the millikelvin temperature range. The conductivity between the
layers shows a sharp tunnel resonance at a density of $1.1 \cdot 10^{10} \text{
cm}^{-2}$, which is consistent with a Josephson-like enhanced tunnel
conductance. The tunnel resonance disappears with increasing densities and the
two 2D charge gases start to show 2D-Fermi-gas behavior. Interlayer
interactions persist causing a positive drag voltage that is very large at
small densities. The transition from the Josephson-like tunnel resonance to the
Fermi-gas behavior is interpreted as a phase transition from an exciton gas in
the Bose-Einstein-condensate state to a degenerate electron-hole Fermi gas.

We explore the dynamics of a tuneable box-trapped Bose gas under strong
periodic forcing in the presence of weak disorder. In absence of interparticle
interactions, the interplay of the drive and disorder results in an isotropic
nonthermal momentum distribution that shows subdiffusive dynamic scaling, with
sublinear energy growth and the universal scaling function captured well by a
compressed exponential. For increasing interaction strength, the gas behavior
crosses over to wave turbulence characterized by a power-law momentum
distribution.

<h3>Asymmetric Thermal Relaxation in Driven Systems: Rotations go Opposite  Ways</h3>

<br>
It was predicted and recently experimentally confirmed that systems with
microscopically reversible dynamics in locally stable potentials warm up faster
than they cool down. This thermal relaxation asymmetry challenged the
local-equilibrium paradigm valid near equilibrium. Because the intuition and
proof hinged on the dynamics obeying detailed balance, the asymmetry was
expected to break down in systems with irreversible dynamics. Contrary to
intuition, we here prove the relaxation asymmetry for systems driven out of
equilibrium by a general linear drift. The asymmetry persists due to a
non-trivial isomorphism between driven and reversible processes. Moreover,
rotational motions emerge at strong driving that, strikingly, occur in opposite
directions during heating and cooling. This highlights that noisy systems do
not relax by passing through local equilibria.
