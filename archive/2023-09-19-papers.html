<h3>Reconstructing bifurcation diagrams of chaotic circuits with reservoir  computing</h3>

Model-free reconstruction of the bifurcation diagrams of Chua's circuits by
the technique of parameter-aware reservoir computing is investigated. We
demonstrate that: (1) reservoir computer can be utilized as a noise filter to
recover the system trajectory from noisy signals; (2) for a single Chua
circuit, the machine trained by the noisy time series measured at several
sampling states is capable of reconstructing the whole bifurcation diagram of
the circuit with a high precision; (3) for two coupled chaotic Chua circuits of
mismatched parameters, the machine trained by the noisy time series measured at
several coupling strengths is able to anticipate the variation of the
synchronization degree of the coupled circuits with respect to the coupling
strength over a wide range. The studies verify the capability of the technique
of parameter-aware reservoir computing in learning the dynamics of chaotic
circuits from noisy signals, signifying the potential application of this
technique in reconstructing the bifurcation diagram of real-world chaotic
systems.

Parity violating superconductors can support a low-dimension local
interaction that becomes, upon condensation, a purely spatial Chern-Simons
term. Solutions to the resulting generalized London equations can be obtained
from solutions of the ordinary London equations with a complex penetration
depth, and suggest several remarkable physical phenomena. The problem of flux
exclusion by a sphere brings in an anapole moment; the problem of
current-carrying wires brings in an azimuthal magnetic field; the problem of
vortices brings in currents along the vortices. We demonstrate that
interactions of this kind, together with a conceptually related dimensionally
reduced Chern-Simons interaction, can arise from physically plausible
microscopic interactions.

<h3>Origin of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene: The magic ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10026</a>

<br>
<br>
The unexpected discovery of superconductivity and strong electron correlation
in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a system containing only sp electrons, is
considered as one of the most intriguing developments in two-dimensional
materials in recent years. The key feature is the emergent flat energy bands
near the Fermi level, a favorable condition for novel many-body phases, at the
so-called "magic angles". The physical origin of these interesting flat bands
has been elusive to date, hindering the construction of an effective theory for
the unconventional electron correlation. In this work, we have identified the
importance of charge accumulation in the AA region of the moire supercell and
the most critical role of the Fermi ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We
show that the magic angles can be predicted by the moire periodicity determined
by the size of this Fermi ring. The resonant criterion in momentum space makes
it possible to coherently combine states on the Fermi ring through scattering
by the moire potential, leading to flat bands near the Fermi level. We thus
establish the physical origin of the magic angles in TBG and identify the
characteristics of one-particle states associated with the flat bands for
further many-body investigations.

The nature of the interplay between fluctuations and quenched random disorder
is a long-standing open problem, particularly in systems with a continuous
order parameter. This lack of a full theoretical treatment has been underscored
by recent advances in experiments on charge density wave materials. To address
this problem, we formulate an exactly solvable model of a two-dimensional
randomly pinned incommensurate charge density wave, and use the large-$N$
technique to map out the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our
approach captures the physics of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition in the clean limit at large $N$. We pay particular attention to the
roles of thermal fluctuations and quenched random field disorder in destroying
long-range order, finding a novel crossover between weakly- and
strongly-disordered regimes.

<h3>Topological quantum chains protected by dipolar and other modulated  symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10036" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10036</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the physics of one-dimensional symmetry protected topological
(SPT) phases protected by symmetries whose symmetry generators exhibit spatial
modulation. We focus in particular on phases protected by symmetries with
linear (i.e., dipolar), quadratic and exponential modulations. We present a
simple recipe for constructing modulated SPT models by generalizing the concept
of decorated domain walls to spatially modulated symmetry defects, and develop
several tools for characterizing and classifying modulated SPT phases. A
salient feature of modulated symmetries is that they are generically only
present for open chains, and are broken upon the imposition of periodic
boundary conditions. Nevertheless, we show that SPT order is present even with
periodic boundary conditions, a phenomenon we understand within the context of
an object we dub a ``bundle symmetry''. In addition, we show that modulated SPT
phases can avoid a certain no-go theorem, leading to an unusual algebraic
structure in their matrix product state descriptions.

<br>
<br>
Ferroelectricity in van der Waals (vdW) layered material has attracted a
great deal of interest recently. CuInP$_2$S$_6$ (CIPS), the only vdW layered
material whose ferroelectricity in the bulk was demonstrated by direct
polarization measurements, was shown to remain ferroelectric down to a
thickness of a few nanometers. However, its ferroelectric properties have just
started to be explored in the context of potential device applications. We
report here the preparation and measurements of metal-ferroelectric
semiconductor-metal heterostructures using nanosheets of CIPS obtained by
mechanical exfoliation. Four bias voltage and polarization dependent resistive
states were observed in the current-voltage characteristics, which we attribute
to the formation of ferroelectric Schottky diode, along with switching
behavior.

<h3>Tuning domain wall oscillation frequency in bent nanowires through a  mechanical analogy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10051</a>
<br>
<i>G. H. R. Bittencourt, V. L. Carvalho-Santos, D. Altbir, O. Chubykalo-Fesenko, R. Moreno</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we present a theoretical model for domain wall (DW)
oscillations in a curved magnetic nanowire with a constant curvature under the
action of a uniaxial magnetic field. Our results show that the DW dynamics can
be described as that of the mechanical pendulum, and both the NW curvature and
the external magnetic field influence its oscillatory frequency. A comparison
between our theoretical approach and experimental data in the literature shows
an excellent agreement. The results presented here can be used to design
devices demanding the proper control of the DW oscillatory motion in NWs.

<h3>Incorporation of random alloy GaBi$_{x}$As$_{1-x}$ barriers in InAs  quantum dot molecules: alloy strain and orbital effects towards enhanced  tunneling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10115" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10115</a>
<br>
<i>Arthur Lin, Matthew F. Doty, Garnett W. Bryant</i>
<br>
<br>
Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence
times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as
building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically
stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be
resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the
hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot.
Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their
stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for
an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin
mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the
tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs
inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an
atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected
by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier,
which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the
presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between
the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss
device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.

<h3>Charge and spin gaps of the ionic Hubbard model with density-dependent  hopping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10126</a>
<br>
<i>Oscar A. Moreno Segura, Karen Hallberg, Armando A. Aligia</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the charge gap $\Delta E_C$ and the spin gap $\Delta E_S$ of the
ionic Hubbard chain including electron-hole symmetric density-dependent
hopping. The vanishing of $\Delta E_C$ ($\Delta E_S$) signals a quantum
critical point (QCP) in the charge (spin) sector. Between both critical points,
the system is a fully gapped spontaneously dimerized insulator (SDI). We focus
our study in this region. Including alternation in the hopping, it is possible
to perform an adiabatic Thouless pump of one charge per cycle, but with a
velocity limited by the size of the gaps.

<h3>A faster direct sampling algorithm for equilateral closed polygons</h3>

<br>
<i>Jason Cantarella, Henrik Schumacher, Clayton Shonkwiler</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a faster direct sampling algorithm for random equilateral closed
polygons in three-dimensional space. This method improves on the moment
polytope sampling algorithm of Cantarella, Duplantier, Shonkwiler, and Uehara
and has (expected) time per sample quadratic in the number of edges in the
polygon.

<h3>Generative modeling, design and analysis of spider silk protein  sequences for enhanced mechanical properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10170</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Lu, David L. Kaplan, Markus J. Buehler</i>
<br>
<br>
Spider silks are remarkable materials characterized by superb mechanical
properties such as strength, extensibility and lightweightedness. Yet, to date,
limited models are available to fully explore sequence-property relationships
for analysis and design. Here we propose a custom generative large-language
model to enable design of novel spider silk protein sequences to meet complex
combinations of target mechanical properties. The model, pretrained on a large
set of protein sequences, is fine-tuned on ~1,000 major ampullate spidroin
(MaSp) sequences for which associated fiber-level mechanical properties exist,
to yield an end-to-end forward and inverse generative strategy. Performance is
assessed through: (1), a novelty analysis and protein type classification for
generated spidroin sequences through BLAST searches, (2) property evaluation
and comparison with similar sequences, (3) comparison of molecular structures,
as well as, and (4) a detailed sequence motif analyses. We generate silk
sequences with property combinations that do not exist in nature, and develop a
deep understanding the mechanistic roles of sequence patterns in achieving
overarching key mechanical properties (elastic modulus, strength, toughness,
failure strain). The model provides an efficient approach to expand the silkome
dataset, facilitating further sequence-structure analyses of silks, and
establishes a foundation for synthetic silk design and optimization.

<h3>Unconventional transport properties in systems with triply degenerate  quadratic band crossings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10198" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10198</a>
<br>
<i>Zhihai Liu, Luyang Wang, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
A quadratic band crossing (QBC) is a crossing of two bands with quadratic
dispersion, which has been intensively investigated due to its appearance in
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. Here, we study an extension of QBCs, the
triply degenerate quadratic band crossing (TQBC), which is a three-band
crossing node containing two quadratic dispersing bands and a flat band. We
focus on two types of TQBCs. The first type contains a symmetry-protected QBC
and a free-electron band, the prototype of which is the AA-stacked bilayer
squareoctagon lattice. In a magnetic field, such a TQBC exhibits an anomalous
Landau level structure, leading to a distinctive quantum Hall effect which
displays an infinite ladder of Hall plateaus when the chemical potential
approaches zero. The other type of TQBC can be viewed as a pseudospin-1
extension of the bilayer-graphene QBC. Under perturbations, this type of TQBCs
may split into linear pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl fermions. When tunneling through
a potential barrier, the transmission probability of the first type decays
exponentially with the barrier width for any incident angle, similar to the
free-electron case, while the second type hosts an all-angle perfect reflection
when the energy of the incident particles is equal to half the barrier height.

<h3>Anomalous normal state gap in an electron-doped cuprate</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the underdoped n-type cuprate Nd2-xCexCuO4, long-ranged antiferromagnetic
order reconstructs the Fermi surface, resulting in a putative antiferromagnetic
metal with small pockets. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
observe an anomalous energy gap, an order of magnitude smaller than the
antiferromagnetic gap, in a wide range of the underdoped regime and smoothly
connecting to the superconducting gap at optimal doping. After carefully
considering all the known ordering tendencies in tandem with the phase diagram,
we hypothesize that the normal state gap in the underdoped n-type cuprates
originates from Cooper pairing. The high temperature scale of the normal state
gap raises the prospect of engineering higher transition temperatures in the
n-type cuprates comparable to that of the p-type cuprates.

<h3>Low-temperature hysteresis broadening emerging from domain-wall creep  dynamics in a two-phase competing system</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hysteretic behaviour accompanies any first-order phase transition, forming a
basis for many applications. However, its quantitative understanding remains
challenging, and even a qualitative understanding of pronounced hysteresis
broadening at low temperature, which is often observed in
magnetic-field-induced first-order phase transition materials, is unclear.
Here, we show that such pronounced hysteresis broadening emerges if the
phase-front velocity during the first-order phase transition exhibits an
activated behaviour as a function of both temperature and magnetic field. This
is demonstrated by using real-space magnetic imaging techniques, for the
magnetic-field-induced first-order phase transition between antiferromagnetic
and ferrimagnetic phases in (Fe$_{0.95}$Zn$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. When
combined with the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi model, the observed activated
temperature- and field-dependences of the growth velocity of the emerging
antiferromagnetic domain quantitatively reproduce the pronounced hysteresis
broadening. Furthermore, the same approach also reproduces the field-sweep-rate
dependence of the transition field observed in the experiment. Our findings
thus provide a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of pronounced
hysteresis broadening from the microscopic perspective of domain growth.

<h3>Field Orientation Dependent Magnetic Phases In Weyl Semimetal Co3Sn2S2</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Magnetism plays a key role in the emergence of topological phenomena in the
Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, which exhibits a ferromagnetic (FM) interactions along
the c-axis of the crystal and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions within
the ab plane. Extensive studies on the temperature dependence of the magnetism
with the magnetic field along the c-axis have uncovered a number of magnetic
phases. Currently, the nature and origins of the reported magnetic phases are
under debate. Here we report on magnetic field orientation effects on the
magnetism in Co3Sn2S2. The shape of the hysteresis loop of the Hall resistance
at a fixed temperature is found to change from rectangular to bow-tie-like as
the magnetic field is tilted from the c-axis towards the ab plane, resembling
that reported for magnetic fields along the c-axis as the temperature
approaches the Curie temperature from below. Unlike their temperature-dependent
counterparts, the newly observed bow-tie-like hysteresis loops show exchange
bias. Our results showcase the contribution of the in-plane AFM interactions to
the magnetism in Co3Sn2S2 and demonstrate a new way to tune its magnetic
phases. They also shed light on the temperature-dependent magnetic phases
occurring in the magnetic field along the c-axis of the crystal.

<h3>Thermodynamics of spin-1/2 fermions on coarse temporal lattices using  automated algebra</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10222" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10222</a>
<br>
<i>K. J. Morrell, A. J. Czejdo, N. Carter, J. E. Drut</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent advances in automated algebra for dilute Fermi gases in the virial
expansion, where coarse temporal lattices were found advantageous, motivate the
study of more general computational schemes that could be applied to arbitrary
densities, beyond the dilute limit where the virial expansion is physically
reasonable. We propose here such an approach by developing what we call the
Quantum Thermodynamics Computational Engine (QTCE). In QTCE, the imaginary-time
direction is discretized and the interaction is accounted for via a quantum
cumulant expansion, where the coefficients are expressed in terms of
noninteracting expectation values. The aim of QTCE is to enable the systematic
resolution of interaction effects at fixed temporal discretization, as in
lattice Monte Carlo calculations, but here in an algebraic rather than
numerical fashion. Using this approach, in combination with numerical
integration techniques (both known and alternative ones proposed here), we
explore the thermodynamics of spin-1/2 fermions, focusing on the unitary limit
in 3 spatial dimensions, but also exploring the effects of continuously varying
the spatial dimension below 3. We find that, remarkably, extremely coarse
temporal lattices, when suitably renormalized using known results from the
virial expansion, yield stable partial sums for QTCE's cumulant expansion which
are qualitatively and quantitatively correct in wide regions, compared with
known experimental results.

<h3>Disorder and diffuse scattering in single-chirality (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I  crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
The quasi-one-dimensional chiral compound (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I has been
extensively studied as a prime example of a topological Weyl semimetal. Upon
crossing its phase transition temperature $T_\textrm{CDW}$ $\approx$ 263 K,
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I exhibits incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) modulations
described by the well-defined propagation vector $\sim$(0.05, 0.05, 0.11),
oblique to the TaSe$_4$ chains. Although optical and transport properties
greatly depend on chirality, there is no systematic report about chiral domain
size for (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I. In this study, our single-crystal scattering
refinements reveal a bulk iodine deficiency, and Flack parameter measurements
on multiple crystals demonstrate that separate (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I crystals have
uniform handedness, supported by direct imaging and helicity dependent THz
emission spectroscopy. Our single-crystal X-ray scattering and calculated
diffraction patterns identify multiple diffuse features and create a real-space
picture of the temperature-dependent (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I crystal structure. The
short-range diffuse features are present at room temperature and decrease in
intensity as the CDW modulation develops. These transverse displacements, along
with electron pinning from the iodine deficiency, help explain why
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I behaves as an electronic semiconductor at temperatures above
and below $T_\textrm{CDW}$, despite a metallic band structure calculated from
density functional theory of the ideal structure.

<h3>Impact of strain on the SOT-driven dynamics of thin film Mn$_3$Sn</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10246</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Mn$_3$Sn, a metallic antiferromagnet with an anti-chiral 120$^\circ$ spin
structure, generates intriguing magneto-transport signatures such as a large
anomalous Hall effect, spin-polarized current with novel symmetries, anomalous
Nernst effect, and magneto-optic Kerr effect. When grown epitaxially as
MgO(110)[001]$\parallel$ Mn$_3$Sn($0\bar{1}\bar{1}0$)[0001], Mn$_3$Sn
experiences a uniaxial tensile strain, which changes the bulk six-fold
anisotropy landscape to a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with two stable
states. In this work, we investigate the field-assisted spin orbit-torque
(SOT)-driven response of the order parameter in single-domain Mn$_3$Sn with
uniaxial tensile strain. We find that for a non-zero external magnetic field,
the order parameter can be switched between the two stable states if the
magnitude of the input current is between two field-dependent critical
currents. Below the lower critical current, the order parameter exhibits a
stationary state in the vicinity of the initial stable state. On the other
hand, above the higher critical current, the order parameter shows oscillatory
dynamics which could be tuned from the 100's of megahertz to the gigahertz
range. We obtain approximate expressions of the two critical currents and find
them to agree very well with the numerical simulations for experimentally
relevant magnetic fields. We also obtain unified functional form of the
switching time versus the input current for different magnetic fields. Finally,
we show that for lower values of Gilbert damping ($\alpha \leq 2\times
10^{-3}$), the critical currents and the final steady states depend
significantly on the damping constant. The numerical and analytic results
presented in our work can be used by both theorists and experimentalists to
understand the SOT-driven order dynamics in PMA Mn$_3$Sn and design future
experiments and devices.

<h3>Observation of universal dissipative dynamics in strongly correlated  quantum gas</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dissipation is unavoidable in quantum systems. It usually induces
decoherences and changes quantum correlations. To access the information of
strongly correlated quantum matters, one has to overcome or suppress
dissipation to extract out the underlying quantum phenomena. However, here we
find an opposite effect that dissipation can be utilized as a powerful tool to
probe the intrinsic correlations of quantum many-body systems. Applying
highly-controllable dissipation in ultracold atomic systems, we observe a
universal dissipative dynamics in strongly correlated one-dimensional quantum
gases. The total particle number of this system follows a universal
stretched-exponential decay, and the stretched exponent measures the anomalous
dimension of the spectral function, a critical exponent characterizing strong
quantum fluctuations of this system. This method could have broad applications
in detecting strongly correlated features, including spin-charge separations
and Fermi arcs in quantum materials.

<h3>Prediction of superconductivity in metallic boron-carbon compounds from  0 to 100 GPa by high-throughput screening</h3>

<br>
<br>
Boron carbon compounds have been shown to have feasible superconductivity. In
our earlier paper [Zheng et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 014508 (2023)], we
identified a new conventional superconductor of LiB3C at 100 GPa. Here, we aim
to extend the investigation of possible superconductivity in this structural
framework by replacing Li atoms with 27 different cations under pressures
ranging from 0 to 100 GPa. Using the high-throughput screening method of
zone-center electron-phonon interaction, we find that ternary compounds like
CaB3C, SrB3C, TiB3C, and VB3C are promising candidates for superconductivity.
The consecutive calculations using the full Brillouin zone confirm that they
have Tc < 31 K at moderate pressures. Our study demonstrates that fast
screening of superconductivity by calculating zone-center electron-phonon
coupling strength is an effective strategy for high-throughput identification
of new superconductors.

<h3>From infinite bond-dimension matrix product states to parent  Hamiltonians</h3>

The study of frustration-free Hamiltonians and their relation to finite bond
dimension matrix-product-states (MPS) has a long tradition. However, fractional
quantum Hall states do not quite fit into this theme, since the known MPS
representations of their ground states have infinite bond dimensions, which
considerably obscures the relations between such MPS representations and the
existence of frustration-free parent Hamiltonians. This is related to the fact
that the latter necessarily are of infinite range in the orbital basis. Here we
present a Theorem taylored to establishing the existence of frustration free
parent Hamiltonians in such a context. We explicitly demonstrate the utility of
this Theorem in the context of non-Abelian Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall
states, but argue the applicability of this Theorem to transcend considerably
beyond the realm of conformal-field-theory-derived matrix product states, or
quasi-one-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

The evolution of excitons from 2D to 3D is of great importance in
photo-physics, yet the layer-dependent exciton polarizability has not been
investigated in 2D semiconductors. Here, we determine the exciton
polarizabilities for 3- to 11-layer black phosphorus-a direct bandgap
semiconductor regardless of the thickness-through frequency-resolved
photocurrent measurements on dual-gate devices and unveil the carrier screening
effect in relatively thicker samples. By taking advantage of the broadband
photocurrent spectra, we are also able to reveal the exciton response for
higher-index subbands under the gate electrical field. Surprisingly, dark
excitons are brightened with intensity even stronger than the allowed
transitions above certain electrical field. Our study not only sheds light on
the exciton evolution with sample thickness, but also paves a way for
optoelectronic applications of few-layer BP in modulators, tunable
photodetectors, emitters and lasers.

In our study, we conduct magnetization and heat capacity measurements to
investigate field-induced magnetic phase transitions within the newly
synthesized compound K2Ni2(SeO3)3, a spin-1 dimer system arranged on a
triangular lattice. The Ni-Ni dimers exhibit a ferromagnetic intra-dimer
interaction, effectively behaving as an ensemble with a total spin of S=2. In
contrast, antiferromagnetic interactions manifest between these dimers on the
triangular lattice. The trigonal distortion of the NiO6 octahedra introduces
easy-axis magnetic anisotropy, accounting for the distinct magnetic phase
diagrams observed when applying c-axis directional and in-plnae magnetic
fields. Notably, our investigation unveils a two-step phase transition with the
magnetic field aligned with the c direction. We propose that the system at the
first transition is from a paramagnetic state to an up-up-down state,
characterized by the Z3 lattice-symmetry breaking. Subsequently, a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, involving the breaking of the
c-axis spin-rotation symmetry, leads to the formation of the ``Y state'' at low
temperatures. These findings yield valuable insights into the magnetic phase
transitions inherent to geometrically frustrated magnetic systems featuring
dimer structures.

The chiral nature of active matter plays an important role in the dynamics of
active matter interacting with chiral structures. Magnetic skyrmions are chiral
objects, and their interaction with chiral nanostructures can lead to
intriguing phenomena. Here, we explore the dynamics of a thermally activated
chiral skyrmion interacting with a chiral flower-like obstacle in a
ferromagnetic layer with chiral exchange interactions. The chiralities from
different aspects in the studied system give rise to nontrivial random-walk
dynamics that may have implications for spintronic applications. We demonstrate
that the thermal random walk of chiral skyrmions interacting with chiral
flowers could lead to deterministic outcomes that are topology-dependent. It is
a spontaneous mesoscopic order-from-disorder phenomenon driven by the thermal
fluctuations and topological nature of skyrmions, which exists only in
ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic substrates with chiral flower-like obstacles.
The interactions between the skyrmions and chiral flowers at finite
temperatures can be utilized to control the skyrmion position and distribution
without the application of any external driving force or temperature gradient.
The fact that a thermally activated skyrmion could be dynamically coupled to a
chiral flower may open a new way for the design of topological sorting devices
based on chiral flower-like nanostructures.

<h3>Theory of Nonequilibrium Symmetry-Breaking Coexistence and Active  Crystallization</h3>

Crystallization is perhaps the most familiar example of a symmetry-breaking
transition. In equilibrium, thermodynamic arguments result in a powerful and
convenient set of criteria for determining the coexistence curves associated
with these transitions. In recent years, nonequilibrium symmetry-breaking
transitions have been routinely observed in a variety of natural and synthetic
systems. The breaking of detailed balance, and the resulting absence of
Boltzmann statistics, motivates the need for a symmetry-breaking coexistence
theory that is independent of the underlying distribution of microstates. Here,
we develop such a theory, relying only on mechanics, balance laws, and system
symmetries. In doing so, we develop a generalized Gibbs-Duhem relation that
results in nonequilibrium coexistence criteria solely in terms of bulk
equations of state. We apply our framework to active crystallization,
developing a complete description of the phase diagram of active Brownian hard
spheres. Our predicted phase diagram quantitatively recapitulates the
solid-fluid coexistence curve as well as other key features of active phase
behavior, such as the liquid-gas coexistence binodal and solid-liquid-gas
triple point. Our findings offer a concrete path forward towards the
development of a general theory for nonequilibrium coexistence.

Various parameters affect the foam stability: surface and bulk rheology of
the solution, gravitational drainage, mechanical vibrations, bubble gas
composition, and also evaporation. Evaporation is often considered through the
prism of a liquid loss, but it also induces a cooling effect due to the
enthalpy of vaporization. In this study, we combine a theoretical and
experimental approach to explore the temperature field in a foam column
evaporating from the top. We show that a measurable temperature profile exists
in this geometry with temperatures at the interface lower than the
environmental temperature by few degrees. We demonstrate that the temperature
profile is the result of a balance between the enthalpy of vaporization and
heat fluxes originating from the thermal conduction of foam and air and the
thermal radiation. For small foam thicknesses compared to the radius, we found
that the temperature gradient is established over the foam thickness while for
large aspect ratios, the gradient is spanning over a lengthscale comparable to
the tube radius.

<h3>Guest-induced phase transition leads to polarization enhancement in  MHyPbCl3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10386" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10386</a>

<br>
<br>
We present a detailed first-principles investigation of the structural and
polar properties of 3D hybrid perovskite, methylhydrazinium lead chloride,
MHyPbCl3, as it transitions from a highly polar Phase-I (high temperature, HT)
to less polar Phase-II (low temperature, LT) from the perspective of host/guest
interactions. Structurally, the two phases vary in the orientation of the guest
and the two differently distorted host layers. The transition character (TC)
across the path of phase transition and a relatively high guest-reorientation
barrier tells that the transition is primarily governed by guest-reorientation.
This overall guest/host transition is interesting because it leads to
enhancement in polarization with temperature which is quite unusual. Maximally
localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) have been used to probe into the atomistic
origin of this enhancement which establishes the leading role of the host
atoms, especially those lying in the more distorted octahedral layer, with only
a negligible contribution from the guest, despite the fact that it is the
primary effect leading to transition. Furthermore, we also find a significant
feedback polarization of ~9% that the host distortion induces on the guest.
This has a direct effect on the density of states occupied by the guest, which
shifts away from the band edge with the increase in the host distortion (for
Phase-II guest orientation). Thus the organic cations in 3D perovskites can
also have a non-trivial contribution to the optoelectronic properties and
exciton binding energies.

<h3>Anomalous Field-Temperature Phase Diagram of Superconductivity in Sn-Pb  Solder</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sn-Pb solders are superconducting materials whose Sn and Pb are perfectly
phase-separated. Recently, anomalous magnetic-flux trapping in a Sn45-Pb55
solder has been revealed where the magnetic fluxes are selectively trapped in
the Sn regions due to the supercurrents in the surrounding Pb regions. Here, we
report on the observation of the anomalous critical field (Hc)-temperature (T)
phase diagram of superconductivity in the Sn45-Pb55 solder. Although the Hc(T)
for the Pb regions decreases with increasing field as in normal type-I
superconductors and is consistent with the conventional trend with Hc(0) ~ 800
Oe, the Hc(T) for the Sn regions exhibits anomalous behaviors. The most
noticeable trend was observed in the field-cooled (under 1500 Oe) solder. The
Hc-T phase diagram for the Sn regions largely varies when the applied external
field is reversed, and Tc increases with increasing field amplitude when H < 0
Oe is applied. On the basis of the flux trapping and the observed anomalous
Hc-T phase diagrams, we propose that the field-robust superconductivity in the
Sn regions is related to the ferromagnetically-aligned magnetic fluxes (or
formation of vortices) in the Sn regions of the Sn45-Pb55 solder.

An improved description of electronic correlation in molecules and materials
can only be achieved by uncovering connections between different areas of
electronic structure theory. A general unifying relationship between the
many-body self-energy and coupled-cluster theory has remained hitherto unknown.
Here, we present a formalism for constructing the coupled-cluster self-energy
from the coupled-cluster ground state energy. Our approach illuminates the
fundamental connections between the many-body self-energy and the
coupled-cluster equations. As a consequence, we naturally arrive at the
coupled-cluster quasiparticle and Bethe-Salpeter equations describing
correlated electrons and excitons. This deep underlying structure explains the
origin of the connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory,
whilst also elucidating the relationship between vertex corrections and the
amplitude equations.

<br>
<br>
In gate-based dispersive sensing, the response of a resonator attached to a
quantum dot gate is detected by a reflected radio-frequency signal. This
enables fast readout of spin qubits and tune up of arrays of quantum dots, but
comes at the expense of increased susceptibility to crosstalk, as the resonator
can amplify spurious signals and induce fluctuations in the quantum dot
potential. We attach tank circuits with superconducting NbN inductors and
internal quality factors $Q_{\mathrm{i}}$>1000 to the interdot barrier gate of
silicon double quantum dot devices. Measuring the interdot transition in
transport, we quantify radio-frequency crosstalk that results in a ring-up of
the resonator when neighbouring plunger gates are driven with frequency
components matching the resonator frequency. This effect complicates qubit
operation and scales with the loaded quality factor of the resonator, the
mutual capacitance between device gate electrodes, and with the inverse of the
parasitic capacitance to ground. Setting qubit frequencies below the resonator
frequency is expected to substantially suppress this type of crosstalk.

Appearance of quantum oscillations (QO) in both thermodynamic and transport
properties of metals at low temperatures is the most striking experimental
consequence of the existence of a Fermi surface (FS). The frequency of these
oscillations and the temperature dependence of their amplitude provides
essential information about the FS topology and fermionic quasiparticle
properties. Here, we report the observation of an anomalous suppression of the
QO amplitude seen in resistivity (Shubnikov de-Haas effect) at sub-kelvin
temperatures in ZrTe5 samples with a single small FS sheet comprising less than
5% of the first Brillouin zone. By comparing these results with measurements of
the magneto-acoustic QO and the recovery of the usual Lifshitz-Kosevich
behavior of the Shubnikov de-Haas (SdH) effect in ZrTe$_5$ samples with a
multi-sheet FS, we show that the suppression of the SdH effect originates from
a decoupling of the electron liquid from the lattice. On crossing the so-called
Bloch-Gr\"uneisen temperature, T$_BG$, electron-phonon scattering becomes
strongly suppressed and in the absence of Umklapp scattering the electronic
liquid regains Galilean invariance. In addition, we show, using a combination
of zero-field electrical conductivity and ultrasonic-absorption measurements,
that entering this regime leads to an abrupt increase of electronic viscosity.

We study the response of generating functionals to a variation of parameters
(couplings) in equilibrium systems i.e. in quantum field theory (QFT) and
equilibrium statistical mechanics. These parameters can be either physical ones
such as coupling constants or artificial ones which are intentionally
introduced such as the renormalization scale in field theories. We first derive
general functional flow equations for the generating functional
(grand-canonical potential) $W[J]$ of the connected diagrams. Then, we obtain
functional flow equations for the one-particle irreducible ($1$PI) vertex
functional (canonical potential) $\Gamma[\phi]$ by performing the Legendre
transformation. By taking the functional derivatives of the flow equations, we
can obtain an infinite hierarchical equations for the $1$PI vertices. We also
point out that a Callan-Symanzik type equation holds among the vertices when
partition function is invariant under some changes of the parameters. After
discussing general aspects of parameter response, we apply our formalism to
several examples and reproduce the well-known functional flow equations. Our
response theory provides us a systematic and general way to obtain various
functional flow equations in equilibrium systems.

The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a
significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers
with equal area and angular rotation velocity. As a result, there have been
suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors
and graphene. However, in the case of monolayer graphene, its quasiparticles
exhibit a linear dispersion, thus making the Sagnac effect in graphene
comparable to that of for light. We investigate the Sagnac effect in the Dirac
materials governed by the relativistic dispersion law and find the value of the
fringe shift. The analysis reveals that optimal sensitivity is achieved in
materials featuring a reduced value of Fermi velocity. Notably, the sign of the
fringe shift depends on the nature of the charge carriers -- whether they are
electrons or holes.

We propose an exactly solvable momentum-space Kondo-BCS model to study heavy
fermion superconductivity. The Kondo interaction is local in momentum space,
which can be derived from an Anderson lattice with a Hatsugai-Kohmoto
interaction between $f$-electrons. By increasing the Kondo interaction, the
model exhibits a crossover from a weak-coupling BCS superconductor to a
strong-coupling heavy fermion superconductor featured with a large gap ratio
and a large specific heat jump anomaly. Accordingly, the normal state evolves
from a Fermi liquid above the BCS superconductor to a non-Fermi liquid
two-fluid state above the heavy fermion superconductor. The two-fluid normal
state also leads to two types of Cooper pairs, one between conduction
electrons, the other between composite fermions formed by conduction electrons
and $f$-spins, which is responsible for the strong coupling behaviors of heavy
fermion superconductivity.

$\mathrm{AuSn_4}$ is the example of an orthorhombic compound that exhibits
topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of
the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry.
Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound with
these symmetries. Interestingly, our main result indicates that
$\mathrm{AuSn_4}$ is unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the
soft modes in the phonon spectra. We find that the $\mathrm{AuSn_4}$ can be
stable with Pbcm at low temperatures using the soft mode analysis. We also show
that the theoretical electronic spectra are well reproduced, and have a good
resemblance with the experimental ARPES spectra. Our findings may be valuable
to the theoretical investigations of $\mathrm{AuSn_4}$ in future.

Information engines model ``Maxwell's demon" mechanistically. However, the
demon's strategy is pre-described by an external experimenter, and information
engines are conveniently designed such that observables contain complete
information about variables pertinent to work extraction. In real world
scenarios, it is more realistic to encounter partial observability, which
forces the physical observer, a necessary part of the information engine, to
make inferences from incomplete knowledge. Here, we use the fact that an
algorithm for computing optimal strategies can be directly derived from
maximizing overall engine work output. For a stylizedly simple decision
problem, we discover interesting optimal strategies that differ notably from
naive coarse graining. They inspire simple, yet compelling, parameterized soft
coarse grainings, as a model class of near-perfect approximations.

The magnetization and electric polarization of a polar antiferromagnet
Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ are studied up to 66 T for spin-saturation magnetic fields
applied along the polar axis. The magnetization process at 1.4 K exhibited
multistep structures below the saturation field of 65 T. The electric
polarization along the polar axis exhibits a similar multistep behavior with a
total change of 1.2 $\rm{\mu}C/cm^{2}$. A combined triangular-lattice
antiferromagnetic model with strong Ising-type spin anisotropy reproduces this
multistep magnetoelectric (ME) effect. The exchange striction mechanism
explains the remarkable ME response in the two sub-lattice type-I multiferroic
materials. These results and interpretation demonstrate a method for realizing
multistage magnetoelectric effects in hybrid spin systems.

<br>
<br>
The approximate power-law dependence of the apparent viscosity of liquids on
shear rate is often argued to arise from a distribution of energy barriers.
However, recent work on the Prandtl model, which consists of a point mass being
dragged by a damped, harmonic spring past a sinusoidal potential, revealed a
similar dependence of the friction on velocity as that of many liquids. Here,
we demonstrate that this correlation is not only qualitative but can also be
made quantitative over a broad temperature range using merely three
dimensionless parameters, at least for alkanes, in particular hexadecane, at
elevated pressure p. These and other observations made on our all-atom alkane
simulations at elevated pressure point to the existence of an elementary
instability causing shear thinning. In addition, the equilibrium viscosity
shows power law dependence on p near the cavitation pressure but an exponential
dependence at large p, while the additional parameter(s) in the Carreau-Yasuda
equation compared to other rheological models turn out justifiable.

We study an s-wave superconductivity in a one-dimensional dimerized diamond
lattice in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. The considered
diamond lattice, comprising of three sublattices per unitcell and having flat
band, has two dimerization patterns; the intra unitcell hoppings have the same
(opposite) dimerization pattern as the corresponding inter unitcell hoppings,
namely, neighboring (facing) dimerization. Using the mean-field theory, we
calculate the superconducting order parameter self-consistently and examine the
stability of the superconducting phase against the spin-orbit coupling, and
Zeeman splitting, dimerization, and temperature. We find that the spin-orbit
coupling or Zeeman splitting individually has a detrimental effect on the
superconductivity, mostly for the facing dimerization. But their mutual effect
revives the superconductivity at charge neutrality point for the facing
dimerization.

Antimony shows promise as a two-dimensional (2D) mono-elemental crystal,
referred to as antimonene. When exposed to ambient conditions, antimonene
layers react with oxygen, forming new crystal structures, leading significant
changes in electronic properties. These changes are influenced by the degree of
oxidation. Utilizing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, stable
configurations of bilayer antimony oxide and their corresponding electronic
properties are studied. Additionally, different stacking arrangements and their
effects on the physical properties of the materials are investigated.
Furthermore, the analysis encompasses strain-free hetero-bilayers containing
both pristine and oxidized antimonene layers, aiming to understand the
interplay between these materials and their collective impact on the bilayer
properties. Our results provide insight into how the properties of
antimony-based bilayer structures can be modified by adjusting stoichiometry
and stacking configurations.

The previously proposed approach for the microscopic description of the
critical behavior of Morse liquids based on the cell fluid model is applied to
the case where the parameters of the Morse interaction potential correspond to
alkali metals (sodium and potassium). The critical temperatures, densities, and
pressures obtained for sodium and potassium agree with the experimental
results. The thermodynamic coefficients (isothermal compressibility, density
fluctuations, and thermal expansion) of sodium are investigated in the
supercritical temperature region. Numerical calculations of thermodynamic
coefficients are performed close to the critical point, where carrying out
theoretical and experimental research is challenging. The change in
compressibility with increasing density at various temperature values is
traced. The behavior of density fluctuations approaching the critical point is
shown for different temperatures. The variation in the magnitude of the thermal
expansion with increasing temperature for different pressure values is
illustrated.

We present the first numerically exact study of self-trapped, a.k.a. soliton,
states of electrons that form in materials with strong quadratic coupling to
the phonon coordinates. Previous studies failed to observe predictions based on
the variational approach in continuum space because soliton states form only
when system parameters are taken to the extreme limit. At the variational
level, we establish that finite-radius solitons emerge through the weak
first-order transition as the coupling strength is increased, and subsequently
collapse to the single-site state through strong first-order transition. Both
transitions transform into smooth crossovers between the light and heavy
polaron states in the full quantum treatment. The most surprising effect not
observed in any other polaron model is non-monotonic dependence of the soliton
effective mass and the residue at strong coupling.

hard (high anisotropy)-soft (high magnetization) composite magnets hold promise
as alternative magnets that could replace modern permanent magnets, such as
rare-earth-based and ceramic magnets, in certain applications. However, so far,
the magnetic properties reported for hard-soft composites have been
underwhelming. Here, an attempt to further understand the correlation between
magnetic and microstructural properties in strontium ferrite-based composites,
hard SrFe12O19 (SFO) ceramics with different contents of Fe particles as soft
phase, both in powder and in dense injection molded magnets, is presented. In
addition, the influence of soft phase particle dimension, in the nano- and
micron-sized regimes, on these properties is studied. While Fe and SFO are not
exchange-coupled in our magnets, a remanence that is higher than expected is
measured. In fact, in composite injection molded anisotropic (magnetically
oriented) magnets, remanence is improved by 2.4% with respect to a pure ferrite
identical magnet. The analysis of the experimental results in combination with
micromagnetic simulations allows us to establish that the type of interaction
between hard and soft phases is of a dipolar nature, and is responsible for the
alignment of a fraction of the soft spins with the magnetization of the hard.
The mechanism unraveled in this work has implications for the development of
novel hard-soft permanent magnets.

We investigate the memory effects under oscillatory shear deformation of
amorphous solids through computer simulations. Applications of shear
deformations in all orthogonal directions show that encoded memories via this
protocol are more robust while performing reading. Our extensive system size
analysis of memory effects shows that memory encoding in small systems is
faster than in larger systems and is probably impossible in thermodynamically
large system sizes. In addition to demonstrating how to encode robust memories
in 3D bulk amorphous materials, we devise protocols for encoding and reading
memories in pseudo-1D materials in the form of amorphous nano-rods. With this,
we show that memory encoding and retrieving can also be done in systems with
open surfaces, which all materials would necessarily have in practice, and is
thus essential to capitalise on the effectiveness of smaller system sizes to
encode memories faster. All in all, we provide protocols for encoding robust
and faster memories in amorphous solids both at bulk and nanoscale.

<h3>Ni/Bi bilayers: The effect of thickness on the superconducting  properties</h3>

Nickel/Bismuth (Ni/Bi) bilayers have recently attracted attention due to the
occurrence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state.
Here, we report on the structural, magnetic and electric characterization of
thin film Ni/Bi bilayers with several Bi thicknesses. We observed the formation
of a complex layered structure depending on the Bi thickness caused by the
inter-diffusion of Bi and Ni which leads to the stabilization of NiBi$_{3}$ at
the Bi/Ni interface. The superconducting transition temperature and the
transition width are highly dependent on the Bi thickness and the layer
structure. Magnetoelectric transport measurements in perpendicular and parallel
magnetic fields were used to investigate the temperature-dependent upper
critical field within the framework of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory
and the Werthamer Helfand Hohenberg model. For thicker samples, we observed a
conventional behavior, similar to that shown by NiBi$_{3}$ bulk samples,
including a small Maki parameter ($\alpha_{M}$ = 0), no spin-orbit scattering
($\lambda_{SO}$= 0) and nearly isotropic coherence length ($\gamma$ =
$\xi_{\perp}$(0)/$\xi_{\parallel}$(0) $\approx$ 1). The values obtained for
these properties are close to those characterizing NiBi$_{3}$ single crystals.
On the other hand, in very thin samples the Maki parameter increases to about
$\alpha_{M}$ = 2.8. In addition, the coherence length becomes anisotropic
($\gamma$ = 0.32) and spin-orbit scattering ($\lambda_{SO}$= 1.2) must be taken
into account. Our results unequivocally show that the properties characterizing
the superconducting state in the Ni/Bi are strongly dependent on the sample
thickness.

In this paper, we have analyzed the spectral and transport properties of a
weakly correlated single-level quantum dot hybridized with one normal
conducting and another Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting lead
(N-QD-S system) in the presence of an external magnetic field. We have employed
Green's function equation of motion (EOM) approach within a self-consistent
Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field approximation to analyze the Hamiltonian. We
studied the effect of on-dot Coulomb correlation and an external magnetic field
on the sub-gap Andreev levels of a quantum dot, strongly coupled to a
conventional s-wave superconductor as a function of impurity parameters. We
have shown that for a finite magnetic field, the Andreev bound states (ABSs)
split into a spin-up and spin-down contribution (i.e. Zeeman splitting) and
cross the Fermi energy level, resulting in a quantum phase transition, which is
an indication of a change in the fermion parity of the ground state. Further,
within the non-linear regime, we discuss the total electrical conductance for
various values of Zeeman energy and on-dot Coulomb interactions. We have
compared our results with the existing experimental and theoretical results.

<h3>Molecular dynamics study of diffusionless phase transformations in HMX:  $Œ≤$-HMX twinning and $Œ≤$-$Œµ$ phase transition</h3>

We use molecular dynamics to study mechanism of deformation twinning of
$\beta$-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane ($\beta$-HMX) in the $P2_1/n$
space group setting for the twin system specified by $K_1=(101)$,
$\eta_1=[10\overline{1}]$, $K_2=(10\overline{1})$, and $\eta_2=[101]$ at $T=1$
K and 300 K. Twinning of a single perfect crystal was induced by imposing
increasing stress. The following three forms of stress were considered:
uniaxial compression along $[001]$, shear stress in $K_1$ plane along $\eta_1$
direction, and shear stress in $K_2$ plane along $\eta_2$ direction. In all
cases the crystal transforms to its twin by the same mechanism: as the stress
increases, the $a$ and $c$ lattice parameters become, respectively, longer and
shorter; soon after the magnitude of $a$ exceeds that of $c$ the system
undergoes a quick phase-transition-like transformation. This transformation can
be approximately separated into two stages: glide of the essentially intact
$\{101\}$ crystal planes along $\langle10\overline{1}\rangle$ crystal
directions followed by rotations of all HMX molecules accompanied by N-NO$_2$
and CH$_2$ group rearrangements. The overall process corresponds to a military
transformation. If uniaxial compression along $[001]$ is applied to a
$\beta$-HMX crystal which is already subject to a hydrostatic pressure $\gtrsim
10$ GPa, the transformation described above proceeds through the crystal-plane
gliding stage but only minor molecular rearrangements occurs. This results in a
high-pressure phase of HMX which belongs to the $P2_1/n$ space group. The
coexistence curve for this high-pressure phase and $\beta$-HMX is constructed
using the harmonic approximation for the crystal Hamiltonians.

Due to its extremely short timescale, the non-equilibrium melting of metals
is exceptionally difficult to probe experimentally. The knowledge of melting
mechanisms is thus based mainly on the results of theoretical predictions. This
work reports on the investigation of ultrafast melting of thin polycrystalline
Pd films studied by optical laser pump - X-ray free-electron laser probe
experiments and molecular-dynamics simulations. By acquiring X-ray diffraction
snapshots with sub-picosecond resolution, we capture the sample's atomic
structure during its transition from the crystalline to the liquid state.
Bridging the timescales of experiments and simulations allows us to formulate a
realistic microscopic picture of melting. We demonstrate that the existing
models of strongly non-equilibrium melting, developed for systems with
relatively weak electron-phonon coupling, remain valid even for ultrafast
heating rates achieved in femtosecond laser-excited Pd. Furthermore, we
highlight the role of pre-existing and transiently generated crystal defects in
the transition to the liquid state.

The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is an antisymmetric exchange
interaction, which is responsible for the formation of topologically protected
spin textures in chiral magnets. Here, by measuring the dispersion relation of
the DM energy, we quantify the atomistic DMI in a model system, i.e., a Co
double layer on Ir(001). We unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a
chirality-inverted DMI, i.e., a sign change in the chirality index of DMI from
negative to positive, when comparing the interaction between nearest neighbors
to that between neighbors located at longer distances. The effect is in analogy
to the change in the character of the Heisenberg exchange interaction from,
e.g., ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic. We show that the pattern of the
atomistic DMI in epitaxial magnetic structures can be very complex and provide
critical insights into the nature of DMI. We anticipate that the observed
effect is general and occurs in many magnetic nanostructures grown on
heavy-element metallic substrates.

<h3>Engineering skyrmion from spin spiral in transition metal multilayers</h3>

Skyrmions having topologically protected field configurations with
particle-like properties play an important role in various field of science.
Our present study focus on the generation of skyrmion from spin spiral in the
magnetic multilayers of 4d-Fe/Ir(111) with 4d = Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh. Here we
investigate the impact of 4d transition metals on the isotropic Heisenberg
exchanges and anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions originating
from the broken inversion symmetry at the interface of 4d-Fe/Ir(111)
multilayers. We find a strong exchange frustration due to the hybridization of
the Fe-3d layer with both 4d and Ir-5d layers which modifies due to band
filling effects of the 4d transition metals. We strengthen the analysis of
exchange frustration by shedding light on the orbital decomposition of
isotropic exchange interactions of Fe-3d orbitals. Our spin dynamics and Monte
Carlo simulations indicate that the magnetic ground state of 4d-Fe/Ir(111)
transition multilayers is a spin spiral in the $ab$-plane with a period of 1 to
2.5 nm generated by magnetic moments of Fe atoms and propagating along the
$a$-direction. The spiral wavelengths in Y-Fe/Ir(111) are much larger compared
to Rh-Fe/Ir(111). In order to manipulate the skyrmion phase in 4d-Fe/Ir(111),
we investigate the magnetic ground state of 4d-Fe/Ir(111) transition
multilayers with different external magnetic field. An increasing external
magnetic field of $\sim$ 12 T is responsible for deforming the spin spiral into
a isolated skyrmion which flips into skyrmion lattice phase around $\sim$ 18 T
in Rh-Fe/Ir(111). Our study predict that the stability of magnetic skyrmion
phase in Rh-Fe/Ir(111) against thermal fluctuations is upto temperature T $\leq
90$ K.

<h3>Thermoelectric response in two-dimensional nodal-point semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this review, we discuss the computation of thermoelectric properties in
two-dimensional (2D) nodal-point semimetals with two bands, and show that the
expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending
on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport. We
consider scatterings arising from short-ranged disorder potential and screened
charged impurities. In all the cases considered, an anisotropy in the band
spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly. We illustrate
this by comparing the results for a semi-Dirac semimetal with those for the
isotropic case (captured by the dispersion of a single valley of graphene). We
also consider the scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied
perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal. For a weak external magnetic
field, when we can ignore the formation of Landau levels, a complex dependence
of the thermopower on $B$ emerges for the anisotropic case. We also describe
the behaviour of the thermoelectric coefficients in the presence of a strong
quantizing magnetic field. Overall, the interplay of anisotropy and strengths
of the external fields provides a promising platform for achieving high
thermoelectric figure-of-merit.

Non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) problems are ubiquitous in almost
every field of study. Recently, all-optical approaches have been explored for
solving classic NP problems based on the spin-glass Ising Hamiltonian. However,
obtaining programmable spin-couplings in large-scale optical Ising simulators,
on the other hand, remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate control of the
interaction length between user-defined parts of a fully-connected Ising
system. This is achieved by exploiting the knowledge of the transmission matrix
of a random medium and by using diffusers of various thickness. Finally, we
exploit our spin-coupling control to observe replica-to-replica fluctuations
and its analogy to standard replica symmetry breaking.

Alloys based on lanthanum phosphate (LaPO$_{4}$) are often employed as
thermal barrier coatings, due to their low thermal conductivity and structural
stability over a wide temperature range. To enhance the thermal-insulation
performance of these alloys, it is essential to comprehensively understand the
fundamental physics governing their heat conduction. Here, we employ the Wigner
formulation of thermal transport in conjunction with first-principles
calculations to elucidate how the interplay between anharmonicity and
compositional disorder determines the thermal properties of
La$_x$Gd$_{1{-}x}$PO$_{4}$ alloys, and discuss the fundamental physics
underlying the emergence and coexistence of particle-like and wave-like
heat-transport mechanisms. Our predictions for microscopic vibrational
properties (temperature-dependent Raman spectrum) and for macroscopic thermal
conductivity are validated against experiments. Finally, we leverage these
findings to devise strategies to optimize the performance of thermal barrier
coatings.

We study the stochastic dynamics of a two-dimensional particle assuming that
the components of its position are two coupled random-acceleration processes
evolving in a confining parabolic potential and are the subjects of independent
Gaussian white noises with different amplitudes (temperatures). We determine
the standard characteristic properties, i.e., the moments of position's
components and their velocities, mixed moments and two-time correlations, as
well as the position-velocity probability density function (pdf). We show that
if the amplitudes of the noises are not equal, then the particle experiences a
non-zero (on average) torque, such that the angular momentum L and the angular
velocity W have non-zero mean values. Both are
(irregularly) oscillating with time t, such that the characteristics of a
rotational motion are changing their signs. We also evaluate the pdf-s of L and
W and show that the former has exponential tails for any fixed t, and hence,
all moments. In addition, in the large-time limit this pdf converges to a
uniform distribution with a diverging variance. The pdf of W possesses heavy
power-law tails such that the mean W is the only existing moment. This pdf
converges to a limiting form which, surprisingly, is completely independent of
the amplitudes of noises.

<h3>Bond Breaking Kinetics in Mechanically Controlled Break Junction  Experiments: A Bayesian Approach</h3>

Breakjunction experiments allow investigating electronic and spintronic
properties at the atomic and molecular scale. These experiments generate by
their very nature broad and asymmetric distributions of the observables of
interest, and thus a full statistical interpretation is warranted. We show here
that understanding the complete distribution is essential for obtaining
reliable estimates. We demonstrate this for Au atomic point contacts, where by
adopting Bayesian reasoning we can reliably estimate the distance to the
transition state, $x{\ddag}$, the associated free energy barrier,
${\Delta}G{\ddag}$, and the curvature $\nu$ of the free energy surface.
Obtaining robust estimates requires less experimental effort than with previous
methods, fewer assumptions, and thus leads to a significant reassessment of the
kinetic parameters in this paradigmatic atomic-scale structure. Our proposed
Bayesian reasoning offers a powerful and general approach when interpreting
inherently stochastic data that yield broad, asymmetric distributions for which
analytical models of the distribution may be developed.
