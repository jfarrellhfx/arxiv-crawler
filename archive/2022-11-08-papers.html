<h3>Ab initio study of proton-exchanged LiNbO3(I): Structural,  thermodynamic, dielectric, and optical properties</h3>

Using first principles calculations, we study the ground-state structure of
bulk proton-exchanged lithium niobate, which is also called hydrogen niobate
and is widely used in waveguides. Thermodynamics helps to establish the most
favorable nonpolar surface as well as the water-deficient and water-rich phases
under different ambient conditions, which we refer to as "dehydrated" and
"rehydrated" phases, respectively. We compute the low-frequency dielectric
response and the optical refractive indices of hydrogen niobate in different
phases. The dielectric constant is greatly enhanced compared to lithium
niobate. At shorter wavelengths, the refractive indices vary between each phase
and have a sharp contrast to lithium niobate. Our study characterizes the
structures and thermal instabilities of this compound and reveals its excellent
dielectric and optical properties, which can be important in the future
application in waveguides.

Gravitational effects in colloidal suspensions can be easily turned off by
matching the density of the solid microparticles with the one of the
surrounding fluid. By studying the motion of catalytic microswimmers with
tunable buoyant weight, we show that this strategy cannot be adopted for active
colloidal suspensions. If the average buoyant weight decreases, pronounced
accumulation at the top wall of a sample cell is observed due to a
counter-alignment of the swimming velocity with the gravitational field. Even
when the particles reach a flat wall, gravitational torques still determine the
properties of the quasi two-dimensional active motion. Our results highlight
the subtle role of gravity in active systems.

<h3>Current and diffusion of Overdamped Active Brownian Particles in a  Ratchet Potential</h3>

The transport properties of a spherical active Brownian particle in a
periodic potential under heavy damping are considered. The self-propelled
particle is subjected to the asymmetric potential, detailed balance is lost and
the particles generate a non-zero drift speed.
The average current is calculated and the diffusivity of the particle is
analyzed from the effective diffusion coefficient. For chiral active particles,
the diffusivity decreases with increasing the angular velocity, confining the
particle near the initial position, and reducing the average current.

<h3>Optimal shepherding and transport of a flock</h3>

We investigate how a shepherd should move in order to effectively herd and
guide a flock of agents towards a target. Using a detailed agent-based model
(ABM) for the members of the flock, we pose and solve an optimization problem
for the shepherd that has to simultaneously work to keep the flock cohesive
while coercing it towards a prescribed project. We find that three distinct
strategies emerge as potential solutions as a function of just two parameters:
the ratio of herd size to shepherd repulsion length and the ratio of herd speed
to shepherd speed. We term these as: (i) mustering, in which the shepherd
circles the herd to ensure compactness, (ii) droving, in which the shepherd
chases the herd in a desired direction, and (iii) driving, a hitherto
unreported strategy where the flock surrounds a shepherd that drives it from
within. A minimal dynamical model for the size, shape and position of the herd
captures the effective behavior of the ABM, and further allows us to
characterize the different herding strategies in terms of the behavior of the
shepherd that librates (mustering), oscillates (droving) or moves steadily
(driving). All together, our study yields a simple and intuitive classification
of herding strategies that ought to be of general interest in the context of
controlling the collective behavior of active matter.

<h3>Automated discovery of generalized standard material models with EUCLID</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04453" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04453</a>
<br>
<i>Moritz Flaschel, Siddhant Kumar, Laura De Lorenzis</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend the scope of our approach for unsupervised automated discovery of
material laws (EUCLID) to the case of a material belonging to an unknown class
of behavior. To this end, we leverage the theory of generalized standard
materials, which encompasses a plethora of important constitutive classes. We
show that, based only on full-field kinematic measurements and net reaction
forces, EUCLID is able to automatically discover the two scalar thermodynamic
potentials, namely, the Helmholtz free energy and the dissipation potential,
which completely define the behavior of generalized standard materials. The a
priori enforced constraint of convexity on these potentials guarantees by
construction stability and thermodynamic consistency of the discovered model;
balance of linear momentum acts as a fundamental constraint to replace the
availability of stress-strain labeled pairs; sparsity promoting regularization
enables the automatic selection of a small subset from a possibly large number
of candidate model features and thus leads to a parsimonious, i.e., simple and
interpretable, model. Importantly, since model features go hand in hand with
the correspondingly active internal variables, sparse regression automatically
induces a parsimonious selection of the few internal variables needed for an
accurate but simple description of the material behavior. A fully automatic
procedure leads to the selection of the hyperparameter controlling the weight
of the sparsity promoting regularization term, in order to strike a
user-defined balance between model accuracy and simplicity. By testing the
method on synthetic data including artificial noise, we demonstrate that EUCLID
is able to automatically discover the true hidden material model from a large
catalog of constitutive classes, including elasticity, viscoelasticity,
elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity, isotropic and kinematic hardening.

<h3>Classification of Interacting Dirac Semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03802" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03802</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng-Jie Huang, Jiabin Yu, Rui-Xing Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological band theory predicts a $\mathbb{Z}$ classification of
three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals (DSMs) at the single-particle level.
Namely, an arbitrary number of identical bulk Dirac nodes will always remain
locally stable and gapless in the single-particle band spectrum, as long as the
protecting symmetry is preserved. In this work, we find that this
single-particle classification for $C_n$-symmetric DSMs will break down to
$\mathbb{Z}_{n/\text{gcd}(2,n)}$ in the presence of symmetry-preserving
electron interactions. Our theory is based on a dimensional reduction strategy
which reduces a 3D Dirac fermions to 1D building blocks, i.e., vortex-line
modes, while respecting all the key symmetries. Using bosonization technique,
we find that there exists a minimal number $N=n/\text{gcd}(2,n)$ such that the
collection of vortex-line modes in $N$ copies of DSMs can be symmetrically
eliminated via four-fermion interactions. While this gapping mechanism does not
have any free-fermion counterpart, it yields an intuitive ``electron-trion
coupling" picture. By developing a topological field theory for DSMs and
further checking the anomaly-free condition, we independently arrive at the
same classification results. Our theory paves the way for understanding
topological crystalline semimetallic phases in the strongly correlated regime.

<h3>Universal correlations along the BEC-BCS crossover</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03832</a>
<br>
<i>J.C. Obeso-Jureidini, G.A. Dominguez-Castro, E. Neri, R. Paredes, V. Romero-Rochin</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the long-distance behavior of the two-body density correlation
functions and the Cooper-pair probability density of a balanced mixture of a
two-component Fermi gas at $T = 0$, is universal along the BEC-BCS crossover.
Our result is demonstrated by numerically solving the mean-field BCS model for
different finite short-range atomic interaction potentials. We find an analytic
expression for the correlation length in terms of the chemical potential and
the energy gap at zero momentum.

<h3>A size-consistent Grüneisen-quasiharmonic approach for lattice thermal  conductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03960</a>
<br>
<i>Chee Kwan Gan, Eng Kang Koh</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a size-consistent Gr\"uneisen-quasiharmonic approach (GQA) to
calculate the lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_l$ where the Gr\"uneisen
parameters that measure the degree of phonon anharmonicity are calculated
directly using first-principles calculations. This is achieved by identifying
and modifying two existing equations related to the Slack formulae for
$\kappa_l$ that suffer from the size-inconsistency problem when dealing with
non-monoatomic primitive cells (where the number of atoms in the primitive cell
$n$ is greater than one). In conjunction with other thermal parameters such as
the acoustic Debye temperature $\theta_a$ that can also be obtained within the
GQA, we predict $\kappa_l$ for a range of materials taken from the diamond,
zincblende, rocksalt, and wurtzite compounds. The results are compared with
that from the experiment and the quasiharmonic Debye model (QDM). We find that
in general the prediction of $\theta_a$ is rather consistent among the GQA,
experiment, and QDM. However, while the QDM somewhat overestimates the
Gr\"uneisen parameters and hence underestimates $\kappa_l$ for most materials,
the GQA predicts the experimental trends of Gr\"uneisen parameters and
$\kappa_l$ more closely. We expect the GQA with the modified Slack formulae
could be used as an effective and practical predictor for $\kappa_l$,
especially for crystals with large $n$.

<h3>Equilibrium thermodynamic properties of binary hard-sphere mixtures from  integral equation theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03961</a>
<br>
<i>Banzragch Tsednee, Tsogbayar Tsednee, Tsookhuu Khinayat</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an equilibrium thermodynamic properties of binary hard-sphere
mixtures from integral equation approach combined with the Percus-Yevick (PY)
and the Martynov-Sarkisov (MS) approximations.
We use the virial, the compressibility and the
Boubl\'{i}k-Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland (BMCSL) equations of state in the
PY approximation, while the virial equation of state is only employed in the MS
approximation. We employ a closed-form expression for evaluating the excess
chemical potential. The excess Helmholtz free energy is obtained using the
Euler relation of thermodynamics. For a number of binary sets of the mixtures
we compare our findings for thermodynamic properties with previously obtained
results in the literature. Generally, the findings from the MS approximation
show better agreement with the results than those from the PY approximation.

The performance of nanoscale electronic devices based on a two-three
dimensional (2D-3D) interface is significantly affected by the electrical
contacts that interconnect these materials with external circuitry. This work
investigates charge transport effects at the 2D-3D ohmic contact coupled with
the thermionic injection model for graphene/Si Schottky junction. Here, w e
focus on the intrinsic properties of graphene-metal contacts, paying particular
attention to the nature of the contact failure mechanism under high electrical
stress. According to our findings, severe current crowding (CC) effects in
highly conductive electrical contact significantly affect device failure that
can be reduced by spatially varying the contact properties and geometry. The
impact of electrical breakdown on material degradation is systematically
analyzed by atomic force, Raman, scanning electron, and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopies. Our devices withstand high electrostatic discharge spikes over
a longer period, manifesting high robustness and operational stability. This
research paves the way towards a highly robust and reliable graphene/Si
heterostructure in futuristic on-chip integration in dynamic switching. The
methods we employed here can be extended for other nanoscale electronic devices
based on 2D-3D interfaces

Strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields offer the possibility of realizing zero
magnetic field Quantum Hall effect in graphene, possibly up to room
temperature, representing a promising avenue for lossless charge transport
applications. Strain engineering on graphene has been achieved via random
nanobubbles or artificial nanostructures on the substrate, but the highly
localized and non-uniform pseudomagnetic fields can make spectroscopic probes
of electronic structure difficult. Heterostructure engineering offers an
alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals
material with large lattice mismatch at a desired twist angle, it is possible
to generate large strain-induced pseudo magnetic fields uniformly over the
entire heterostructure. Here, we report using nano-angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) to probe the electronic bandstructure of a
graphene/black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP). By directly measuring the
iso-energy contours of graphene and black phosphorus we determine a twist angle
of 20-degrees in our heterostructure. High-resolution nano-ARPES of the
graphene bands near the Fermi level reveals the emergence of flat bands located
within the Dirac cone. The spacing of the flat bands is consistent with Landau
level formation in graphene, and corresponds to a pseudo-field of 11.36 T. Our
work provides a new way to study quantum Hall phases induced by strain in 2D
materials and heterostructures.

<h3>On the topological surface states of the intrinsic magnetic topological  insulator Mn-Bi-Te family</h3>

<br>
<br>
We review recent progress in the electronic structure study of intrinsic
magnetic topological insulators (MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$
($n=0,1,2,3$) family. Specifically, we focus on the ubiquitously (nearly)
gapless behavior of the topological surface state Dirac cone observed by
photoemission spectroscopy, even though a large Dirac gap is expected because
of surface ferromagnetic order. The dichotomy between experiment and theory
concerning this gap behavior is perhaps the most critical and puzzling question
in this frontier. We discuss various proposals accounting for the lack of
magnetic effect on the topological surface state Dirac cone, which are mainly
categorized into two pictures, magnetic reconfiguration, and topological
surface state redistribution. Band engineering towards opening a magnetic gap
of topological surface states provides great opportunities to realize quantized
topological transport and axion electrodynamics at higher temperatures.

<h3>Thermally Induced Structural Evolution and Nanoscale Interfacial  Dynamics in Layered Metal Chalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
Layered chalcogenides including Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi-Sb-Te ternary alloys and
heterostructures are known as great thermoelectric, topological insulators and
recently highlighted as plasmonic building blocks beyond noble metals. Here, we
conduct a joint in situ transmission electron microscopy (in situ TEM) and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the temperature
dependent nanoscale dynamics, interfacial properties and further identifying
the role of native defects and edge configurations in anisotropic sublimations
of Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 in-plane heterostructure and Sb2-xBixTe3 alloy. Structural
dynamics including edge evolution, formation, expansion, and coalescence of
thermally induced polygonal nanopores are reported. The nanopores appear to be
initiated by preferential dissociation of chalcogenide species (Te) from the
center, heterointerface and edges in the heterostructure and only from the
outer edges in the alloy counterpart. This results in a reduced thermal
stability and significantly different sublimation pathways of the
heterostructure. Furthermore, triangular and quasi hexagonal configurations are
observed to be the dominant nanopores configurations in the heterostructure.
Additionally, our DFT calculations provide a mechanistic understanding on the
role of native defects and edge formation energies, revealing the antisite
defects TeBi to be the dominant native defect in a Te-rich condition and
playing a key role on the defects assisted sublimation. These findings
significantly impact our understanding of controlling the nanoscale sublimation
dynamics and can ultimately assist us in designing tunable low-dimensional
chalcogenides.

<h3>Quantum metallic state in the titanium sesquioxide heterointerface  superconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
The emergence of the quantum metallic state marked by a saturating finite
electrical resistance in the zero-temperature limit in a variety of
two-dimensional superconductors injects a new momentum to the realm of
unconventional superconductivity. Despite much research efforts over last few
decades, there is not yet a general consensus on the nature of this unexpected
quantum metal. Here, we report the unique quantum metallic state within the
hallmark of Bose-metal characterized by the saturated resistance and
simultaneously vanished Hall resistance in the titanium sesquioxide
heterointerface superconductor Ti$_2$O$_3$/GaN. Strikingly, the quantum bosonic
metallic state proximate to the two-dimensional superconductivity-metal
transition tuned by magnetic fields persists in the normal phase, suggesting
that the existence of composite bosons formed by electron Cooper pairs survives
even in the normal phase. Our work marks the observation of the preformed
electron Cooper pairs in heterointerface superconductor and sheds new light on
understanding the underlying pairing mechanism of unconventional
superconductivity.

<h3>Transparent electrodes based on a mixture of wanowires and nanorings</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have studied the electrical conductance of two-dimensional random
percolating networks of zero-width metallic nanowires (a mixture of rings and
sticks). We toke into account the nanowire resistance per unit length and the
junction (nanowire/nanowire contact) resistance. Using a mean-field
approximation (MFA), we derived the total electrical conductance of the
nanowire-based networks as a function of their geometrical and physical
parameters. The MFA predictions have been confirmed by our Monte Carlo (MC)
numerical simulations. MC simulations were focused on the case when the
circumferences of the rings and the lengths of the wires are equal. In this
case, the electrical conductance of the network is almost insensitive to the
proportions of rings and sticks when the wire resistance and the junction
resistance are equal. When the junction resistance dominates over the wire
resistance, a linear dependency of the electrical conductance of the network on
the proportions of rings and sticks was observed.

Ferroelectrics are essential in low-dimensional memory devices for multi-bit
storage and high-density integration. A polar structure is a necessary premise
for ferroelectricity, mainly existing in compounds. However, it is usually rare
in elemental materials, causing a lack of spontaneous electric polarization.
Here, we report an unexpected room-temperature ferroelectricity in few-chain Te
nanowires. Out-of-plane ferroelectric loops and domain reversal are observed by
piezoresponse force microscopy. Through density functional theory, we attribute
the ferroelectricity to the ion-displacement created by the interlayer
interaction between lone pair electrons. Ferroelectric polarization can induce
a strong field effect on the transport along the Te chain, supporting a
self-gated field-effect transistor. It enables a nonvolatile memory with high
in-plane mobility, zero supply voltage, multilevel resistive states, and a high
on/off ratio. Our work provides new opportunities for elemental ferroelectrics
with polar structures and paves a way towards applications such as low-power
dissipation electronics and computing-in-memory devices.

Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating
periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these
oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron dynamics
and mechanical motion. Due to the complexity of this mechanism, these
self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable behavior causing
hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles and characterize the
stability of different regimes in single and double quantum dot configurations.
In particular cases, we find these oscillations stable for over 20 seconds,
many orders of magnitude above electronic and mechanical characteristic
timescales, revealing the robustness of the mechanism at play. The experimental
results are reproduced by our theoretical model that provides a complete
understanding of bistability in nanoelectromechanical devices.

<h3>Efficient low temperature simulations for fermionic reservoirs with the  hierarchical equations of motion method: Application to the Anderson impurity  model</h3>

The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach is an accurate method to
simulate open system quantum dynamics, which allows for systematic convergence
to numerically exact results. To represent the effects of the bath, the
reservoir correlation functions are usually decomposed into the summation of
multiple exponential terms in the HEOM method. Since the reservoir correlation
functions become highly non-Markovian at low temperatures or when the bath has
complex band structures, a present challenge is to obtain accurate exponential
decompositions that allow efficient simulation with the HEOM. In this work, we
employ the barycentric representation to approximate the Fermi function and
hybridization functions in the frequency domain. The new method, by
approximating these functions with optimized rational decomposition, greatly
reduces the number of basis functions in decomposing the reservoir correlation
functions, which further allows the HEOM method to be applied to ultra-low
temperature and general bath structures. We demonstrate the efficiency,
accuracy, and long-time stability of the new decomposition scheme by applying
it to the Anderson impurity model (AIM) in the low-temperature regime with the
Lorentzian and tight-binding hybridization functions.

<h3>Hall Effect in Doped Mott - Hubbard Insulator</h3>

<br>
We present theoretical analysis of Hall effect in doped Mott - Hubbard
insulator, considered as a prototype of cuprate superconductor. We consider the
standard Hubbard model within DMFT approximation. As a typical case we consider
the partially filled (hole doping) lower Hubbard band. We calculate the doping
dependence of both the Hall coefficient and Hall number and determine the value
of carrier concentration, where Hall effect changes its sign. We obtain a
significant dependence of Hall effect parameters on temperature. Disorder
effects are taken into account in a qualitative way.We also perform a
comparison of our theoretical results with some known experiments on doping
dependence of Hall number in the normal state of YBCO and Nd-LSCO,
demonstrating rather satisfactory agreement of theory and experiment. Thus the
doping dependence of Hall effect parameters obtained within Hubbard model can
be considered as an alternative to a popular model of the quantum critical
point.

<h3>Large shift current, $π$ Zak phase and unconventional nature in Se and  Te</h3>

Recently, unconventional materials (or obstructed atomic insulators) have
attracted lots of attention owing to the unconventional feature of mismatch
between Wannier centers and atomic positions. In this paper, we demonstrate
that the trigonal Selenium and Tellurium host unconventional nature in both
electronic and phonon spectra. In electronic band structures, the band
representation (BR) decomposition for occupied bands has to contain the
essential BR of $A@3b$, and the real-space invariant is $\delta_1@3b=-1$. The
unconventional nature is related to the $\pi$ Zak phase, suggesting that the
one-dimensional Se/Te chain is a chiral Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. The
effective magnetism can be induced by $p$ states at ends. More importantly, a
large shift current is obtained in Se quantum well, making it a good candidate
for the utilization of solar energy via bulk photovoltaic effect. In addtion,
in phonon spectra, three sets of phonon bands are well separated and assigned
to $B@3b$, $B@3a$, and $A@3b$ BRs, respectively. Thus, the obstructed phonon
states are predicted on the (0001)-surface phonon spectrum. As the prototypes
of unconventional materials in both electronic and phonon spectra, our findings
could intrigue much interest on the study of obstructed surface electronic and
phonon states in this kind of novel materials.

The interplay between ferroelectricity and band topology can give rise to a
wide range of both fundamental and applied research. Here, we map out the
emergence of nontrivial corner states in two-dimensional ferroelectrics, and
remarkably demonstrate that ferroelectricity and corner states are coupled
together by crystallographic symmetry to realize the electric control of
higher-order topology. Implemented by density functional theory, we identify a
series of experimentally synthesized two-dimensional ferroelectrics, such as
In$_2$Se$_3$, BN bilayers, and SnS, as realistic material candidates for the
proposed ferroelectric higher-order topological insulators. Our work not only
sheds new light on traditional ferroelectric materials but also opens an avenue
to bridge the higher-order topology and ferroelectricity that provides a
nonvolatile handle to manipulate the topology in next-generation electronic
devices.

<br>
More and more materials, with a growing variety of properties, are built into
electronic devices. This is motivated both by increased device performance and
by the studies of materials themselves. An important type of device is a
Josephson junction based on the proximity effect between a quantum material and
a superconductor, useful for fundamental research as well as for quantum and
other technologies. When both junction contacts are placed on the same surface,
such as a two-dimensional material, the junction is called ``planar". One
outstanding challenge is that not all materials are amenable to the standard
planar junction fabrication. The device quality, rather than the intrinsic
characteristics, may be defining the results. Here, we introduce a technique in
which nanowires are placed on the surface and act as a shadow mask for the
superconductor. The advantages are that the smallest dimension is determined by
the nanowire diameter and does not require lithography, and that the junction
is not exposed to chemicals such as etchants. We demonstrate this method with
an InAs quantum well, using two superconductors - Al and Sn, and two
semiconductor nanowires - InAs and InSb. The junctions exhibit critical current
levels consistent with transparent interfaces and uniform width. We show that
the template nanowire can be operated as a self-aligned electrostatic gate.
Beyond single junctions, we create SQUIDs with two gate-tunable junctions. We
suggest that our method can be used for a large variety of quantum materials
including van der Waals layers, topological insulators, Weyl semimetals and
future materials for which proximity effect devices is a promising research
avenue.

In this work, we investigate the multimode Brownian oscillators in
nonequilibrium scenarios with multiple reservoirs at different temperatures.
For this purpose, an algebraic method is proposed. This approach directly gives
the exact time--local equation of motion for reduced density operator, from
which we can easily extract both the reduced system and hybrid bath dynamical
informations. Two representative entangled system--bath quantities, the heat
transport and the thermodynamics of quantum mixing, are studied. It is
anticipated that the method developed in this work would constitute a crucial
component for nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for open quantum systems.

The optical and electrical properties of films made of nanoparticles of

material for transparent electrodes, smart windows, and nonlinear optics
components. In this work, a systematic study of the resistance in ITO
nanocrystalline films, as a function of post fabrication parameters, such as
the temperature and time of annealing, has been performed. A tunability of the
resistance with the annealing parameters, in a range of three orders of

<h3>A time-based Chern number in periodically-driven systems in the  adiabatic limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04150</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
To define the topology of driven systems, recent works have proposed
synthetic dimensions as a way to uncover the underlying parameter space of
topological invariants. Using time as a synthetic dimension, together with a
momentum dimension, gives access to a synthetic 2D Chern number. It is,
however, still unclear how the synthetic 2D Chern number is related to the
Chern number that is defined from a parametric variable that evolves with time.
Here we show that in periodically driven systems in the adiabatic limit, the
synthetic 2D Chern number is a multiple of the Chern number defined from the
parametric variable. The synthetic 2D Chern number can thus be engineered via
how the parametric variable evolves in its own space. We justify our claims by
investigating Thouless pumping in two 1D tight-binding models, a three-site
chain model and a two-1D-sliding-chains model. The present findings could be
extended to higher dimensions and other periodically driven configurations.

<h3>Composition Dependent Instabilities in Mixtures With Many Components</h3>

<br>
<i>Filipe C Thewes, Matthias Krüger, Peter Sollich</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding the phase behavior of mixtures with many components is
important in many contexts, including as a key step toward a physics-based
description of intracellular compartmentalization. Here, we study the
instabilities of a mixture model where the second virial coefficients are taken
as random Gaussian variables. Using tools from free probability theory we
obtain the exact spinodal curve and the nature of instabilities for a mixture
with an arbitrary composition, thus lifting the assumption of uniform mixture
component densities pervading previous studies. We show that, by controlling
the volume fraction of only a few components, one can systematically change the
nature of the spinodal instability and achieve demixing for realistic scenarios
by a strong {\em composition imbalance amplification}. This results from a
non-trivial interplay of entropic effects due to non-uniform composition and
complexity in the interactions. Our approach allows for the inclusion of any
finite number of structured interactions, leading to a competition between
different forms of demixing as density is varied.

<h3>Optimal model of semi-infinite graphene for ab initio calculations of  reactions at graphene edges by the example of zigzag edge reconstruction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04181" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04181</a>
<br>
<i>Yulia G. Polynskaya, Irina V. Lebedeva, Andrey A. Knizhnik, Andrey M. Popov</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate how parameters of the model of semi-infinite graphene based on
a graphene nanoribbon under periodic boundary conditions affect the accuracy of
ab initio calculations of reactions at graphene edges by the example of the
first stage of reconstruction of zigzag graphene edges, formation of a
pentagon-heptagon pair. It is shown that to converge properly the results, the
nanoribbon should consist of at least 6 zigzag rows and periodic images of the
pair along the nanoribbon axis should be separated by at least 6 hexagons. The
converged reaction energy and activation barrier for formation of an isolated
pentagon-heptagon pair are found to be -0.15 eV and 1.61 eV, respectively. It
is also revealed that such defects reduce the graphene edge magnetization only
locally but ordering of spins at opposite nanoribbon edges switches from the
antiparallel (antiferromagnetic) to parallel one (ferromagnetic) upon
increasing the defect density.

<h3>Light-amplified Landau-Zener conductivity in gapped graphene monolayers:  a simulacrum of photo-catalyzed vacuum instability</h3>

<br>
<i>Selym Villalba-Chávez, Oliver Mathiak, Reinhold Egger, Carsten Müller</i>
<br>
<br>
Interband transitions of electrons in a gapped graphene monolayer are highly
stimulated near the Fermi surface when a high-frequency electric wave of weak
intensity and a strong constant electric field are superposed on its surface.
We consider the situation in which the photon energy associated with the
fast-oscillating field is slightly below the graphene gap so that the quantum
transitions still occur through tunneling effects while being facilitated by
multiphoton absorption channels. In the considered parameter regime the
photo-catalyzed current linked to the described setup is shown to exceed the
one driven by the strong field solely by several orders of magnitude.
Optimization conditions are revealed and an asymptotic formula for the current
density is derived. The robustness of our assessment supports the viability of
detecting this phenomenon in graphene, which would serve as a
first-principle-proof of concept of the dynamically-assisted Schwinger
mechanism in QED.

<h3>Charge fluctuations above $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ revealed by glasslike thermal  transport in kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs)</h3>

<br>
<i>Kunya Yang, Wei Xia, Xinrun Mi, Long Zhang, Yuhan Gan, Aifeng Wang, Yisheng Chai, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Xiaolong Yang, Yanfeng Guo, Mingquan He</i>
<br>
<br>
We present heat capacity, electrical and thermal transport measurements of
kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). In all three compounds,
development of short-range charge fluctuations above the charge density wave
(CDW) transition temperature $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ strongly scatters phonons via
electron-phonon coupling, leading to glasslike phonon heat transport, i.e.,
phonon thermal conductivity decreases weakly upon cooling. Once the long-range
charge order sets in below $T_\mathrm{CDW}$, short-range charge fluctuations
are quenched, and the typical Umklapp scattering dominated phonon heat
transport is recovered. The charge-fluctuations-induced glasslike phonon
thermal conductivity implies sizable electron-phonon coupling in
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$.

<h3>A novel approach for modeling the non-Newtonian behavior of simple  liquids: application to liquid water viscosity from low to high shear rates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04228" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04228</a>
<br>
<i>Frédéric Aitken, Ferdinand Volino</i>
<br>
<br>
The aim of this paper is to present a modeling for the rheological behavior
of simple liquids as a function of the amplitude of the imposed shear stress or
strain. The elastic mode theory (Ref. 6) is first generalized to take into
account the fact that during a flow experiment, mechanical energy is injected
in a system initially at thermodynamic equilibrium. This generalized theory can
be seen as a particular aspect of the general problem of perturbation by the
measurement, associated with that of the coupling between fluctuation and
dissipation. This generalization leads to a "finitary" character of the model.
It is then combined with the inertial mode theory (Ref. 7). The formalism thus
obtained allows to model the rheological behavior of liquids over a wide range
of velocity gradients, including the intermediate narrow range corresponding to
the Newtonian regime. As experimental tests, viscosity measurements with two
kinds of moving rotor rheometers were performed. Only data obtained with liquid
water at room temperature are presented and quantitatively analyzed here. It is
also shown that liquid n-octane exhibits the same qualitative behaviors as
those of liquid water. In the appendices, connection of this theory with
quantum mechanics and turbulence phenomena are discussed, and the notion of
viscous mass is introduced.

<br>
<br>
We study the valence crossover and strong electron-phonon coupling of
EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ by polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy. The fully-symmetric
phonon mode shows strongly asymmetric lineshape at low temperature, indicating
Fano-type interaction between this mode and a continuum of electron-hole
excitations. Moreover, the frequency and linewidth of the phonon modes exhibit
anomalies across the valence-crossover temperature, suggesting the coupling
between valence fluctuations and lattice vibration. In particular, two phonon
modes show significantly enhanced Gr\"uneisen parameter, suggesting proximity
to a critical elasticity regime. The relative contribution of the structural
change and valence change to the phonon anomalies is evaluated by density
functional theory calculations.

We extract the vortex lattice parameters using low-frequency two-coil mutual

fit the temperature dependence of ac penetration depth in the mixed state using

vortex lattice parameters such as pinning constant, vortex lattice drag

<h3>Microwave-assisted thermoelectricity in SIS' tunnel junctions</h3>

<i>A. Hijano, F. S. Bergeret, F. Giazotto, A. Braggio</i>
<br>
<br>
Asymmetric superconducting tunnel junctions with gaps $\Delta_1>\Delta_2$
have been proven to show a peculiar nonlinear bipolar thermoelectric effect.
This arises due to the spontaneous breaking of electron-hole symmetry in the
system, and it is maximized at the matching-peak bias
$|V|=V_p=(\Delta_1-\Delta_2)/e$. In this paper, we investigate the interplay of
photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) and bipolar thermoelectric generation. In
particular, we show how thermoelectricity, at the matching peak, is supported
by photon absorption/emission processes at the frequency-shifted sidebands
$V=\pm V_p+n\hbar\omega$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This represents a sort of
microwave-assisted thermoelectricity. We show the existence of multiple stable
solutions, being associated with different photon sidebands, when a load is
connected to the junction. Finally, we discuss how the nonlinear cooling
effects are modified by the PAT. The proposed device can detect millimeter
wavelength signals by converting a temperature gradient into a thermoelectric
current or voltage.

<h3>Upper Critical Field of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under In-Plane Uniaxial Pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
In-plane uniaxial pressure has been shown to strongly tune the
superconducting state of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ by approaching a Lifshitz transition and
associated Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states. At the VHS,
$T_c$ and the in- and out-of-plane upper critical fields are all strongly
enhanced, and the latter has changed its curvature as a function of temperature
from convex to concave. However, due to strain inhomogeneity it has not been
possible so far to determine how the upper critical fields change with strain.
Here, we show the strain dependence of both upper critical fields, which was
achieved due to an improved sample preparation. We find that the in-plane upper
critical field is mostly linear in $T_c$. On the other hand, the out-of-plane
upper critical field varies with a higher power in $T_c$, and peaks strongly at
the VHS. The strong increase in magnitude and the change in form of
$H_\mathrm{c2||c}$ occur very close to the Van Hove strain, and points to a
strong enhancement of both the density of states and the gap magnitude at the
Lifshitz transition.

<br>
<br>
Extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) is a geometric magnetoresistance effect
occurring in hybrid devices consisting of a high-mobility material joined by a
metal. The change in resistance can exceed 107% at room temperature when a
magnetic field of 5 T is applied. Magnetic field sensors based on EMR hold the
potential formeasuring weak magnetic fields with an unprecedented sensitivity,
yet, to date this potential is largely unmet. In this work, we provide an
extensive review of the current state-of-the-art in EMR sensors with a focus on
the hybrid device geometries, the constituent material properties and
applications of EMR. We present a direct comparison of the best devices in
literature across magnetoresistance, sensitivity and noise equivalent field for
different materials and geometric designs. The compilation of studies collected
in this review illustrates the extremely rich possibilities for tuning the
magnetoresistive behavior varying the device geometry and material properties.
In addition, we aim to improve the understanding of the EMR effect and its
interplay with geometry and material properties. Finally, we discuss recent
trends in the field and future perspectives for EMR.

A variational method for studying the ground state of strongly interacting
quantum many-body bosonic systems is presented. Our approach constructs a class
of extensive variational non-Gaussian wavefunctions which extend Gaussian
states by means of nonlinear canonical transformations (NLCT) on the fields of
the theory under consideration. We illustrate this method with the one
dimensional Bose-Hubbard model for which the proposal presented here, provides
a family of approximate ground states at arbitrarily large values of the
interaction strength. We find that, for different values of the interaction,
the non-Gaussian NLCT-trial states sensibly improve the ground state energy
estimation when the system is in the Mott phase.

<i>Jonathan D'Emidio, Roman Orus, Nicolas Laflorencie, Fernando de Juan</i>
<br>
<br>
The entanglement entropy is a unique probe to reveal universal features of
strongly interacting many-body systems. In two or more dimensions these
features are subtle, and detecting them numerically requires extreme precision,
a notoriously difficult task. This is especially challenging in models of
interacting fermions, where many such universal features have yet to be
observed. In this paper we tackle this challenge by introducing a new method to
compute the R\'enyi entanglement entropy in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, where we treat the entangling region itself as a stochastic
variable. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method by extracting, for the
first time, universal subleading logarithmic terms in a two dimensional model
of interacting fermions, focusing on the honeycomb Hubbard model at $T=0$. We
detect the universal corner contribution due to gapless fermions throughout the
Dirac semi-metal phase and at the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point, as well as
the universal Goldstone mode contribution in the antiferromagnetic Mott
insulating phase.

<br>
<br>
The second harmonic generation (SHG) effect is a powerful tool for
characterizing the magnetic structures of materials. Bridging the connection
between the SHG effect and the symmetries of magnetic materials has been at the
frontier of fundamental research in condensed matter physics. The construction
of a complete and exclusive classification of SHG effect of magnetic materials
offers a straightforward approach to insight into these intriguing connections.
In this work, we proposed a comprehensive classification of the SHG effect in
magnetic materials using \emph{isomorphic group} method. Seven types of SHG
effect in magnetic materials have been classified by considering the symmetries
of the magnetic phases and the corresponding parent phases. This classification
clearly depicts the physical origins of the SHG effect in magnetic materials
with various symmetries. Specifically, the classification predicts that the
magnetism could also purely contribute to the even parts (not invariant under
time reversal operation, or $i$-type) of the SHG effect, which enriches the
conventional understandings. In addition, a dictionary containing SHG and
linear magneto-optic effect of magnetic materials in MANGDATA database is
further established. The first-principles calculations on some representative
magnetic materials further validate the effectiveness of the proposed
classification. Our findings provide an efficient way to reveal the underlying
physics of the SHG effect in magnetic materials, and can help us to explore
magnetic properties via the SHG effect more conveniently and instructively.

We investigate native point defects and rare-earth (co)dopants in
SrAl$_2$O$_4$ using hybrid density-functional defect calculations. Europium
(Eu) and dysprosium (Dy) are found to be mixed valence and energetically most
favorable at the Sr lattice sites. However, unlike Eu where both Eu$^{2+}$ and
Eu$^{3+}$ can be realized in synthesis, Dy is stable predominantly as
Dy$^{3+}$, and the divalent Dy$^{2+}$ may only be photogenerated under
irradiation. On the basis of an analysis of Eu-related band--defect (including
charge-transfer) and interconfigurational $5d$--$4f$ optical transitions, we
assign the characteristic broad blue (445 nm) and green (520 nm) emission bands
in Eu$^{2+}$-doped SrAl$_2$O$_4$ to the $4f^65d^1$ $\rightarrow$ $4f^7$
transition in Eu$^{2+}$ incorporated at the Sr1 and Sr2 sites, respectively.
Strontium interstitials (not oxygen vacancies, in contrast to what is commonly
believed) and Dy$_{\rm Sr}$ can act as efficient electron traps for
room-temperature persistent luminescence. This work calls for a re-assessment
of certain assumptions regarding specific carrier trapping centers made in all
mechanisms previously proposed for the persistent luminescence in Eu- and
(Eu,Dy)-doped SrAl$_2$O$_4$. It also serves as a methodological template for
the understanding and design of rare-earth doped phosphors.

Multi-flagellated microorganisms can buckle and writhe under their own
activity as they swim through a viscous fluid. New equilibrium configurations
and steady-state dynamics then emerge which depend on the organism's mechanical
properties and on the oriented distribution of flagella along its surface.
Modeling the cell body as a semi-flexible Kirchhoff rod and coupling the
mechanics to a dynamically evolving flagellar orientation field, we derive the
Euler-Poincar{\'e} equations governing dynamics of the system, and rationalize
experimental observations of buckling and writhing of elongated swarmer {\it P.
mirabilis} cells. A sequence of bifurcations is identified as the body is made
more compliant, due to both buckling and torsional instabilities. The results
suggest that swarmer cells invest no more resources in maintaining membrane
integrity than is necessary to prevent self-buckling.

Landau - de Gennes mean field model predicts the discontinuous transition for
the Isotropic - Nematic transition, associated with uniaxial and quadrupolar

dielectric studies for rod-like nematogenic pentylcyanobiphenyl (5CB) and its
nanocolloids with BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The scan of dielectric constant
revealed the continuous I-N transition in a compressed nanocolloid with a tiny
amount of nanoparticles (x=0.1%). For the nematic phase in 5CB and its x=1%
nanocolloid the enormous values of dielectric constant and the bending-type
long-range pretransitional behavior were detected. The 'shaping' influence of
pretransitional fluctuations was also detected for the ionic-related
contribution to dielectric permittivity in the isotropic phase. For the
high-frequency relaxation domain, this impact was tested for the primary
relaxation time and the translational-orientaional decoupling.

First-principles computational spectroscopy is a critical tool for
interpreting experiment, performing structure refinement, and developing new
physical understanding. Systematically setting up input files for different
simulation codes and a diverse class of materials is a challenging task with a
very high barrier-to-entry, given the complexities and nuances of each
individual simulation package. This task is non-trivial even for experts in the
electronic structure field and nearly formidable for non-expert researchers.
Lightshow solves this problem by providing a uniform abstraction for writing
computational x-ray spectroscopy input files for multiple popular codes,
including FEFF, VASP, OCEAN, EXCITING and XSPECTRA. Its extendable framework
will also allow the community to easily add new functions and to incorporate
