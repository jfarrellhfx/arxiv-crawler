<h3>Universal Relations of Energy Flow, Acoustic Spin and Torque for  Near-Field Acoustic Tweezers</h3>

Acoustic spin, radiation torque, energy flow, and reactive power are of
significant importance from both fundamental and practical aspects, responsible
for flexible tweezer manipulations and near-field sound directionality.
Nevertheless, the intrinsic relations among these physical quantities are far
from clear. Here, we prove the universal geometric relations among them in
acoustics, independent on wave structure details. Particularly, we connect
acoustic spin and torque to the cross product of time-averaged energy flow and
reactive power, as well as to the local vorticity of energy flow. These
relations are universally valid, verified in a variety of different acoustic
systems. We also demonstrate the multipole mechanical torques and forces
generated in three acoustic near-field sources: Janus, Huygens and Spin
sources, applying on small lossy particles. These universal geometric relations
uncover hidden locking relations beyond simple spin-momentum locking of
near-field waves, and show the basic principles between the acoustic spin,
radiation torque, and energy flow, reactive power.

The study of active soft matter has developed into one of the most rapidly
growing areas of physics. Field theories, which can be developed either via
phenomenological considerations or by coarse-graining of a microscopic model,
are a very useful tool for understanding active systems. Here, we provide a
detailed review of a particular coarse-graining procedure, the
interaction-expansion method (IEM). The IEM allows for the systematic
microscopic derivation of predictive field theories for systems of interacting
active particles. We explain in detail how it can be used for a microscopic
derivation of active model B+, which is a widely used scalar active matter
model. Extensions and possible future applications are also discussed.

We summarize and extend some of the results obtained recently for the
microscopic and macroscopic behavior of a pinned harmonic chain, with random
velocity flips at Poissonian times, acted on by a periodic force {at one end}
and in contact with a heat bath at the other end. Here we consider the case
where the system is in contact with two heat baths at different temperatures
and a periodic force is applied at any position. This leads in the hydrodynamic
limit to a heat equation for the temperature profile with a discontinuous slope
at the position where the force acts. Higher dimensional systems, unpinned
cases and anharmonic interactions are also considered.

Bilayer graphene is an attractive material that realizes high-quality
two-dimensional electron gas with a controllable bandgap. By utilizing the
bandgap, electrical gate tuning of the carrier is possible and formation of
nanostructures such as quantum dots have been reported. To probe the dynamics
of the electronics states and realize applications for quantum bit devices,
RF-reflectometry which enables high-speed electric measurements is important.
Here we demonstrate RF-reflectometry in bilayer graphene devices. We utilize a
micro graphite back-gate and an undoped Si substrate to reduce the parasitic
capacitance which degrades the RF-reflectometry. We measure the resonance
properties of a tank circuit which contains the bilayer graphene device. We
form RF-reflectmetory setup and compared the result with the DC measurement,
and confirmed their consistency. We also measure Coulomb diamonds of quantum
dots possibly formed by bubbles and confirm that RF-reflectometry of quantum
dots can be performed. This technique enables high-speed measurements of
bilayer graphene quantum dots and contributes to the research of bilayer
graphene-based quantum devices by fast readout of the states.

Bioactive glasses (BGs) and glass-ceramics (BGCs) have become a diverse
family of materials being applied for treatment of many medical conditions. The
traditional understanding of bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics pins them to
bone-bonding capability without considering the other fields where they excel,
such as soft tissue repair. We attempt to provide an updated definition of BGs
and BGCs by comparing their structure, processing, and properties to those of
other biomaterials. The proposed modern definition allows for consideration of
all applications where the BGs and BGCs are currently used in the clinic and
where the future of these promising biomaterials will grow. The new proposed
definition of a bioactive glass is "a non-equilibrium, non-crystalline material
that has been designed to induce specific biological activity". The proposed
definition of a bioactive glass-ceramic is "an inorganic, non-metallic material
that contains at least one crystalline phase within a glassy matrix and has
been designed to induce specific biological activity." BGs and BGCs can bond to
bone and soft tissues or contribute to their regeneration. They can deliver a
specified concentration of inorganic therapeutic ions, heat for
magnetic-induced hyperthermia or laser-induced phototherapy, radiation for
brachytherapy, and drug delivery to combat pathogens and cancers.

<h3>Microdomains and Stress Distributions in Bacterial Monolayers on Curved  Interfaces</h3>

Monolayers of growing non-motile rod-shaped bacteria act as active nematic
materials composed of hard particles rather than the flexible components of
other commonly studied active nematics. The organization of these granular
monolayers has been studied on flat surfaces but not on curved surfaces, which
are known to change the behavior of other active nematics. We use molecular
dynamics simulations to track alignment and stress in growing monolayers fixed
to curved surfaces, and investigate how these vary with changing surface
curvature and cell aspect ratio. We find that the length scale of alignment
(measured by average microdomain size) increases with cell aspect ratio and
decreases with curvature. Additionally, we find that alignment controls the
distribution of extensile stresses in the monolayer by concentrating stress in
low-order regions. These results connect active nematic physics to bacterial
monolayers and can be applied to model bacteria growing on droplets, such as
marine oil-degrading bacteria.

<h3>Feedback-controlled solute transport through chemo-responsive polymer  membranes</h3>

Polymer membranes are typically assumed to be inert and nonresponsive to the
flux and density of the permeating particles in transport processes. Here, we
study theoretically the consequences of membrane responsiveness and feedback on
the steady-state force--flux relations and membrane permeability using a
nonlinear-feedback solution-diffusion model of transport through a slab-like
membrane. Therein, the solute concentration inside the membrane depends on the
bulk concentration, $c_0$, the driving force, $f$, and the polymer volume
fraction, $\phi$. In our model, solute accumulation in the membrane causes a
sigmoidal volume phase transition of the polymer, changing its permeability,
which, in return, affects the membrane's solute uptake. This feedback leads to
nonlinear force--flux relations, $j(f)$, which we quantify in terms of the
system's differential permeability, $\mathcal{P}_\text{sys}^{\Delta}\propto
{\mathrm{d}j}/{\mathrm{d}f}$. We find that the membrane feedback can increase
or decrease the solute flux by orders of magnitude, triggered by a small change
in the driving force, and largely tunable by attractive versus repulsive
solute--membrane interactions. Moreover, controlling the input, $c_0$ and $f$,
can lead to steady-state bistability of $\phi$ and hysteresis in the
force--flux relations. This work advocates that the fine-tuning of the
membrane's chemo-responsiveness will enhance the nonlinear transport control
features, providing great potential for future (self-)regulating membrane
devices.

<h3>Numerical simulation of two-component attractive Fermi gases based on  parametrized partition function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00580" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00580</a>

The zero-temperature and finite-temperature thermodynamics of two-component
Fermi gases with finite-range attractive interaction suffer from fermion sign
problem, which seems like an insurmountable problem in exact numerical
simulations. In a recent work, we find a reliable method to simulate the
thermodynamic properties of single-component Fermi gases for both
noninteracting and repulsively interacting cases based on the method of
parametrized partition function and the $\xi_E$ curve of constant energy. In
the present work, this method is generalized to two-component Fermi gases with
finite-range attractive interaction, which shows clearly that our method has
good chance to apply to various Fermi systems. From the simulated heat
capacity, we find a peak at the temperature below the Fermi temperature which
implies the pairing of fermions with different spin. At high temperature, the
simulated heat capacity approaches the classical value. The reasonable result
in this work validates the application of our method to attractive cases, which
implies a wide range of applications, from nuclear physics, BCS-BEC crossover,
superconductivity, to neutron star, etc..

<h3>An insight into the properties of ATiO3 (A=Ti,Sr) materials for  photovoltaic applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00635</a>

<i>Lynet Allan, Robinson Musembi, Julius Mwabora</i>
<br>
<br>
One of the most active research areas in the world is the search for
effective materials for use in the fields of optoelectronics and photovoltaics.
The potential of materials like ATiO3 (A=Ti,Sr) is yet largely untapped. Ab
initio studies based on density functional theory (DFT) have been used to
comprehensively explore the structural, electronic, elastic, and optical
properties of Ti2O3 and SrTiO3. In this study, the ground state properties were
computed with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), without spin-orbit coupling, and with
the inclusion of Hubbard U parameter. The electronic bandgaps of Ti2O3 have
been found to be 0.059 eV without SOC, 0.131 eV with SOC, and 1.665 eV with
Hubbard U. Electronic bandgaps of 1.612 eV, 1.761 eV, and 2.769 eV have been
obtained for SrTiO3, respectively, without SOC, with SOC, and with Hubbard U.
In every single case, it has been found that Ti-4d orbitals predominate close
to the top of the valence band. The bandgap and estimated lattice constants for
ATiO3 (A=Ti,Sr) were not significantly affected by SOC. The mechanical
stability test showed that ATiO3 (A=Ti,Sr) is mechanically stable at zero
pressure. The optical band gap has been seen to increase when Hubbard U is
taken into account. In general, the Hubbard U parameter enhances bandgap and
optical property predictions. Ti2O3 and SrTiO3 are good UV-Vis absorbers and
appropriate for photovoltaic applications owing to the optical absorption
coefficient curves being found to cover the ultraviolet to visible (UV-Vis)
ranges.

<h3>Spatiotemporal control of active topological defects</h3>

Topological defects play a central role in the physics of many materials,
including magnets, superconductors and liquid crystals. In active fluids,
defects become autonomous particles that spontaneously propel from internal
active stresses and drive chaotic flows stirring the fluid. The intimate
connection between defect textures and active flow suggests that properties of
active materials can be engineered by controlling defects, but design
principles for their spatiotemporal control remain elusive. Here we provide a
symmetry-based additive strategy for using elementary activity patterns, as
active topological tweezers, to create, move and braid such defects. By
combining theory and simulations, we demonstrate how, at the collective level,
spatial activity gradients act like electric fields which, when strong enough,
induce an inverted topological polarization of defects, akin to an exotic
negative susceptibility dielectric. We harness this feature in a dynamic
setting to collectively pattern and transport interacting active defects. Our
work establishes an additive framework to sculpt flows and manipulate active
defects in both space and time, paving the way to design programmable active
and living materials for transport, memory and logic.

<h3>Interpreting Deep Learning by Establishing a Rigorous Corresponding  Relationship with Renormalization Group</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00005" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00005</a>

<i>Fuzhou Gong, Zigeng Xia</i>

In this paper, we focus on the interpretability of deep neural network. Our
work is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) in statistical mechanics.
RG plays the role of a bridge connecting microscopical properties and
macroscopic properties, the coarse graining procedure of it is quite similar
with the calculation between layers in the forward propagation of the neural
network algorithm. From this point of view we establish a rigorous
corresponding relationship between the deep neural network (DNN) and RG.
Concretely, we consider the most general fully connected network structure and
real space RG of one dimensional Ising model. We prove that when the parameters
of neural network achieve their optimal value, the limit of coupling constant
of the output of neural network equals to the fixed point of the coupling
constant in RG of one dimensional Ising model. This conclusion shows that the
training process of neural network is equivalent to RG and therefore the
network extract macroscopic feature from the input data just like RG.

<h3>Configurational Forces in Penetration Processes</h3>

<br>

With a loose reference to problems of penetration in biomechanics (for
instance, a nanoparticle penetrating through a cell's membrane or a cell sucked
with a pipette), the role of configurational forces is investigated during the
process in which a compliant intruder is inserted into an elastic structure.
For insertion into a rigid constraint, a configurational force proportional to
the square of the strain needed to deform the body, which is penetrating, is
found. This force has a more complex structure when the compliance of the
constraint is kept into account, but in all cases, it tends to expel the
penetrating body.

<h3>Effects of target anisotropy on harmonic measure and mean first-passage  time</h3>

<br>

In this paper, we investigate the influence of target anisotropy on two
characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions: harmonic measure density and
mean first-passage time. First, we compute the volume-averaged harmonic measure
density on prolate and oblate spheroidal targets inside a confining domain in
three dimensions. This allows us to quantify the uniformity of this density in
the small target limit. Second, we derive an explicit expression of the mean
first-passage time to such targets and analyze the effect of anisotropy. In
particular, we illustrate the accuracy of the capacitance approximation for
small targets.

<h3>Interacting Topological Quantum Chemistry in 2D: Many-body Real Space  Invariants</h3>

The topological phases of non-interacting fermions have been classified by
their symmetries, culminating in a modern electronic band theory where
wavefunction topology can be obtained (in part) from momentum space. Recently,
Real Space Invariants (RSIs) have provided a spatially local description of the
global momentum space indices. The present work generalizes this real space
classification to interacting 2D states. We construct many-body local RSIs as
the quantum numbers of a set of symmetry operators on open boundaries, but
which are independent of the choice of boundary. Using the $U(1)$ particle
number, they yield many-body fragile topological indices, which we use to
identify which single-particle fragile states are many-body topological or
trivial at weak coupling. To this end, we construct an exactly solvable
Hamiltonian with single-particle fragile topology that is adiabatically
connected to a trivial state through strong coupling. We then define global
many-body RSIs on periodic boundary conditions. They reduce to Chern numbers in
the band theory limit, but also identify strongly correlated stable topological
phases with no single-particle counterpart. Finally, we show that the many-body
local RSIs appear as quantized coefficients of Wen-Zee terms in the topological
quantum field theory describing the phase.

<h3>Quantum and classical Floquet prethermalization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00041</a>

<br>
Time-periodic (Floquet) driving is a powerful way to control the dynamics of
complex systems, which can be used to induce a plethora of new physical
phenomena. However, when applied to many-body systems, Floquet driving can also
cause heating, and lead to a featureless infinite-temperature state, hindering
most useful applications. It is therefore important to find mechanisms to
suppress such effects. Floquet prethermalization refers to the phenomenon where
many-body systems subject to a high-frequency periodic drive avoid heating for
very long times, instead tending to transient states that can host interesting
physics. Its key signature is a strong parametric suppression of the heating
rate as a function of the driving frequency. Here, we review our present
understanding of this phenomenon in both quantum and classical systems, and
across various models and methods. In particular, we present rigorous theorems
underpinning Floquet prethermalization in quantum spin and fermionic lattice
systems, extensions to systems with degrees of freedom that have unbounded
local dimension. Further, we briefly describe applications to novel
nonequilibrium phases of matter, and recent experiments probing
prethermalization with quantum simulators. We close by describing the frontiers
of Floquet prethermalization beyond strictly time-periodic drives, including
time-quasiperiodic driving and long-lived quasi-conserved quantities enabled by
large separation of energy scales.

<h3>$\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquids in the higher spin-$S$ Kitaev honeycomb  model: An exact deconfined $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge structure in a non-integrable  model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The higher spin Kitaev model prominently features the extensive locally
conserved quantities the same as the spin-$1/2$ Kitaev honeycomb model,
although it is not exactly solvable. It remains an open question regarding the
physical meaning of these conserved quantities in the higher spin model. In
this work, by introducing a Majorana parton construction for a general spin-$S$
we uncover that these conserved quantities are exactly the $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge
fluxes in the general spin-$S$ model, including the case of spin-$1/2$.
Particularly, we find an even-odd effect that the $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge charges
are fermions in the half integer spin model, but are bosons in the integer spin
model. We further prove that the fermionic $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge charges are
always deconfined, hence the half integer spin Kitaev model would have
non-trivial spin liquid ground states regardless of interaction strengths in
the Hamiltonian. The bosonic $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge charges of the integer spin
model, on the other hand, could condense leading to a trivial product state,
and it is indeed the case at the anisotropic limit of the model.

<h3>Electric backaction on moiré mechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00082</a>

<i>Héctor Ochoa</i>
<br>
<br>
A lattice mismatch between Van der Waals layers produces a moir\'e pattern
and a subsequent electron band reconstruction. When the bilayer is charged, the
sliding motion of one layer with respect to the other produces electric
pumping. Here I discuss the reciprocal process: that a voltage bias produces a
layer-shear mechanical force. The effect is deduced from the lowest-order
correction to the mechanical action by the coupling with electrons in an
external field. In twisted bilayer graphene the new mechanical force is shown
to be perpendicular to the applied field (due to C$_2$ symmetries exchanging
the layers) and proportional to the charge density measured from neutrality.
This is strictly true when the chemical potential is within a gap opened by the
moir\'e potential due to a topological quantization, and approximately true
when the chemical potential crosses the flat bands in a model including the
self-consistent Hartree interaction. In a mechanical device the effect should
be manifested as an apparent enhancement of the friction between layers when
the system is charged. Depinning fields for the sliding motion of the layers
are estimated in the order of $\mathcal{E}_c\sim$ kV/cm around the magic angle.

Magnetic state of ferrimagnets composed of several magnetic sublattices is
described by a phase diagram owing a specific temperature point of
magnetization compensation. Up to now spin dynamics in ferrimagnets has been
investigated mostly in the collinear phase and most of the effects specific for
the non-colinear phase near the compensation point were overlooked. Here we
synthetized a dielectric ferrimagnetic with compensation point around room
temperature to fill this gap. Peculiarities of quasi-ferromagnetic and
-antiferromagnetic modes excited by ultrashort laser pulses in the
non-collinear state are identified. The noncollinearity makes
quasi-antiferromagnetic mode sensitive to the external magnetic field and
brings frequencies of the two modes much closer together. The
quasi-ferromagnetic mode frequency maximizes near the compensation point and
vanishes towards the collinear phase. At the phase transition its amplitude
angle significantly increases reaching 7{\deg}. This opens new opportunities
for the applications of laser induced spin dynamics in ferrimagnets for
magnonics.

<h3>Dynamic Light Scattering based microrheology of End-functionalised  triblock copolymer solutions</h3>

<br>
<br>
'Soft' patchy surfactant micelles have become an additional building tool in
self-assembling systems. The triblock copolymer, Pluronic F108, forms spherical
micelles in aqueous solutions upon heating leading to a simple phase diagram
with a micellar crystalline solid at higher temperatures and concentrations.
Here we report the strong influence of end-functionalising the chain ends
either with an azide or azide-DNA complex on the systems' phase behaviour. We
find that the azide(N3)- functionalisation renders the chain ends weakly
hydrophobic at lower temperatures, causing them to self-assemble into
flower-micelles. This hydrophobicity increases with increasing temperature and
poses a competing self-assembling mechanism to the solvent induces hydrophobic
interactions between the middle-blocks of F108 at higher temperatures and leads
to a macroscopic phase separation that is absent in the pure F108 system.
However, when we attached short, hydrophilic single-stranded (ss)DNA to the
azide groups via click chemistry the chain ends became 'sticky' due to DNA
hybridisation below the melting temperature of the complementary ssDNA ends
while reverting to hydrophilic behaviour above. We characterise their
structural and rheological properties via Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and
DLS-based passive microrheology with an improved time-frequency domain
inversion step. We present the structural behaviour of dilute and semi-dilute
solutions of the original F108 system and compare the results with solutions
containing either the F108- azide (F108-N3) or partially DNA-functionalised
F108-azide chains. Our DLS and microrheology studies inform us on how the
attachment of azide groups on F108 changes the mechanical and structural
properties of micellar fluids pioneering further characterisation and design of
these hybrid systems.

<h3>Tailoring the dielectric screening in WS$_2$-graphene heterostructures</h3>

We investigate the tuning of the band gap and the exciton binding energy in
the two-dimensional semiconductor \WS\ via the external dielectric screening.
Embedding \WS\ in van der Waals heterostructures with graphene and hBN spacers
of thicknesses between one and 16 atomic layers, we experimentally determine
both energies as a function of the \WS-to-graphene interlayer distance. We find
that the modification to the band gap as well as the exciton binding energy are
well described by a one-over-distance dependence, with a significant effect
remaining at several nm distance, at which the two layers are electrically well
isolated. This observation is explained by a screening arising from an image
charge induced by the graphene layer. Furthermore, we find that the
effectiveness of graphene to screen Coulomb interactions in nearby \WS\ depends
on its doping level and can therefore be controlled via the electric field
effect. We determine that, at room temperature, it is modified by approximately
20\% for charge carrier densities of $2\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$.

<h3>On the nature of overcharging and charge inversion in electrical double  layers</h3>

Understanding overcharging and charge inversion is one of the long-standing
challenges in soft matter and biophysics. To study these phenomena, we apply
the modified Gaussian renormalized fluctuation theory, which for the first time
self-consistently accounts for spatially varying ionic strength, dielectric
permittivity, and excluded volume effect. The underlying dependence of
overcharging on the electrostatic coupling is elucidated by varying surface
charge, counterion valency, and dielectric contrast. Three characteristic
regimes corresponding to weak, moderate, and strong coupling are identified.
Important features like the inversion of zeta potential, crowding, and ionic
layering at the surface are successfully captured. Our theory predicts
non-monotonic dependence of charge inversion on multivalent salt concentration
as well as the addition of monovalent salt, in quantitative agreement with
experiments.

<h3>Asymptotic Homogenization in the Determination of Effective Intrinsic  Magnetic Properties of Composites</h3>

We present a computational framework for two-scale asymptotic homogenization
to determine the intrinsic magnetic permeability of composites. To this end,
considering linear magnetostatics, both vector and scalar potential
formulations are used. Our homogenization algorithm for solving the cell
problem is based on the displacement method presented in Lukkassen et al. 1995,
Composites Engineering, 5(5), 519-531. We propose the use of the meridional
eccentricity of the permeability tensor ellipsoid as an anisotropy index
quantifying the degree of directionality in the linear magnetic response. As
application problems, 2D regular and random microstructures with overlapping
and nonoverlapping monodisperse disks, all of which are periodic, are
considered. We show that, for the vanishing corrector function, the derived
effective magnetic permeability tensor gives the (lower) Reuss and (upper)
Voigt bounds with the vector and scalar potential formulations, respectively.
Our results with periodic boundary conditions show an excellent agreement with
analytical solutions for regular composites, whereas, for random heterogeneous
materials, their convergence with volume element size is fast. Predictions for
material systems with monodisperse overlapping disks for a given inclusion
volume fraction provide the highest magnetic permeability with the most
increased inclusion interaction. In contrast, the disk arrangements in regular
square lattices result in the lowest magnetic permeability and inadequate
inclusion interaction. Such differences are beyond the reach of the isotropic
effective medium theories, which use only the phase volume fraction and shape
as mere statistical microstructural descriptors.

<br>
<br>
Mechanically quenching a thin film of smectic-C liquid crystal results in the
formation of a dense array of thousands of topological defects in the director
field. The subsequent rapid coarsening of the film texture by the mutual
annihilation of defects of opposite sign has been captured using high-speed,
polarized light video microscopy. The temporal evolution of the texture has
been characterized using an object-detection convolutional neural network to
determine the defect locations, and a binary classification network customized
to evaluate the brush orientation dynamics around the defects in order to
determine their topological signs. At early times following the quench,
inherent limits on the spatial resolution result in undercounting of the
defects and deviations from expected behavior. At intermediate to late times,
the observed annihilation dynamics scale in agreement with theoretical
predictions and simulations of the $2$D XY model.

<h3>Resolving stress state at crack tip to elucidate nature of elastomeric  fracture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00159</a>
<br>
<i>Zehao Fan, Shi-Qing Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on spatial-temporal resolved measurements of the stress field at crack
tip based on polarized optical microscopy (str-POM), the stress analysis
approach to elastomeric fracture uncovers new insights. We show new
phenomenology in contrast to the standard description of linear elastic
fracture mechanics (LEFM). First, str-POM measurements show emergence of a
stress saturation zone whose dimension r_ss is independent of the stress
intensity factor K. This elastic zone is plastic zone whose size would scale
quadratically with K. The absence of stress divergence allows us to measure tip
stress s_tip at the onset of fracture, identified as inherent material
strength, i.e., s_tip(F) = s_F(inh). We are able to explain why LEFM applies
well to elastomers, i.e., why toughness (either given as critical energy
release rate Gc or critical stress intensity factor Kc) is a material constant,
and we have identified parameters that determine the magnitude of toughness.
Second, the popular Rivlin-Thomas energy balance description of elastomeric
fracture in pure shear has acquired a fresh and different interpretation based
on str-POM observations, which show that the stress buildup at cut tip
explicitly scales with specimen height h0, leading to Gc = wch0 being constant.
Third, the str-POM observations reveal how elastomeric fracture occurs at a
common Kc independent of specimen thickness. At a given load there is weaker
stress buildup for a thicker specimen due to greater stress saturation at cut
tip, and fracture is observed to occur at lower tip stress for a thicker
specimen.

<h3>Emergent Orbital Skyrmion Lattice in a Triangular Atom Array</h3>

Multi-orbital optical lattices have been attracting rapidly growing research
interests in the last several years, providing fascinating opportunities for
orbital-based quantum simulations. Here, we consider bosonic atoms loaded in
the degenerate $p$-orbital bands of a two-dimensional triangular optical
lattice. This system is described by a multi-orbital Bose-Hubbard model. We
find the confined atoms in this system develop spontaneous orbital
polarization, which forms a chiral Skyrmion lattice pattern in a large regime
of the phase diagram. This is in contrast to its spin analogue which largely
requires spin-orbit couplings. The emergence of the Skyrmion lattice is
confirmed in both bosonic dynamical mean-field theory (BDMFT) and exact
diagonalization (ED) calculations. By analyzing the quantum tunneling induced
orbital-exchange interaction in the strong interaction limit, we find the
Skyrmion lattice state arises due to the interplay of $p$-orbital symmetry and
the geometric frustration of the triangular lattice. We provide experimental
consequences of the orbital Skyrmion state, that can be readily tested in cold
atom experiments. Our study implies orbital-based quantum simulations could
bring exotic scenarios unexpected from their spin analogue.

<h3>Ground state dynamically stable phases for fluorine in the TPa pressure  regime by evolutionary algorithms</h3>

<br>
<i>Beatriz Helena Cogollo-Olivo, Javier A. Montoya</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we employed \textit{ab initio} methods combined with
evolutionary algorithms for searching stable structures for fluorine in the
terapascal (TPa) regime. We performed several structural searches using the
USPEX code, at pressures that spanned from 1 to 5 TPa and considered up to 16
atoms per cell for selected pressures. Our findings partially support recent
studies by validating the transformation of fluorine from a molecular form,
$Cmca$, into an intermediate polymeric form before its eventual dissociation.
In fact, the enthalpy comparisons between candidate structures of fluorine at
high pressure show a direct transition from the molecular phase $Cmca$ into a
$Pm\bar{3}n$ extended structure at 2.7 TPa, the later consisting of linear
chains and independent atoms, which disagrees with previous conflicting reports
that proposed other intermediate phases to also exist as stable crystalline
forms close to 3 TPa.

<br>
<br>
By using a non-self-consistent many-body $T$-matrix theory, we calculate the
finite-temperature Raman spectroscopy of a mobile impurity immersed in a Fermi
bath in three dimensions. The dependences of the Raman spectrum on the
transferred momentum, temperature, and impurity-bath interaction are discussed
in detail. We confirm that the peak in the Raman spectrum shows a weaker
dependence on the impurity concentration than that in the radio-frequency
spectroscopy, due to the nonzero transferred momentum, as anticipated. We
compare our theoretical prediction with the recent measurement by Gal Ness
\textsl{et al.} in Physical Review X \textbf{10}, 041019 (2020) without any
adjustable parameters. At weak coupling, we find a good quantitative agreement.
However, close to the Feshbach resonance the agreement becomes worse. At strong
coupling, we find that an unrealistic Fermi bath temperature might be needed,
in order to account for the experimental data.

<br>
<br>
We study Josephson junctions based on InSb nanowires with Sn shells. We
observe skewed critical current diffraction patterns: the maxima in forward and
reverse current bias are at different magnetic flux, with a displacement of
20-40 mT. The skew is greatest when the external field is nearly perpendicular
to the nanowire, in the substrate plane. This orientation suggests that
spin-orbit interaction plays a role. We develop a phenomenological model and
perform tight-binding calculations, both methods reproducing the essential
features of the experiment. The effect modeled is the $\phi$0-Josephson
junction with higher-order Josephson harmonics. The system is of interest for
Majorana studies: the effects are either precursor to or concomitant with
topological superconductivity. Current-phase relations that lack inversion
symmetry can also be used to design quantum circuits with engineered
nonlinearity.

<h3>Nonreciprocal Phonon Propagation in a Metallic Chiral Magnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
The phonon magnetochiral effect (MChE) is the nonreciprocal acoustic and
thermal transports of phonons caused by the simultaneous breaking of the mirror
and time-reversal symmetries. So far, the phonon MChE has been observed only in
a ferrimagnetic insulator Cu2OSeO3, where the nonreciprocal response disappears
above the Curie temperature of 58 K. Here, we study the nonreciprocal acoustic
properties of a room-temperature ferromagnet Co9Zn9Mn2 for unveiling the phonon
MChE close to the room temperature. Surprisingly, the nonreciprocity in this
metallic compound is enhanced at higher temperatures and observed up to 250 K.
This clear contrast between insulating Cu2OSeO3 and metallic Co9Zn9Mn2 suggests
that metallic magnets have a mechanism to enhance the nonreciprocity at higher
temperatures. From the ultrasound and microwave-spectroscopy experiments, we
conclude that the magnitude of the phonon MChE of Co9Zn9Mn2 mostly depends on
the magnon bandwidth, which increases at low temperatures and hinders the
magnon-phonon hybridization. Our results suggest that the phonon nonreciprocity
could be further enhanced by engineering the magnon band of materials.

The unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has long served as a
benchmark for theories of correlated-electron materials. The determination of
the superconducting pairing mechanism requires detailed experimental
information on collective bosonic excitations as potential mediators of Cooper
pairing. We have used Ru $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to
obtain comprehensive maps of the electronic excitations of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ over
the entire Brillouin zone. We observe multiple branches of dispersive spin and
orbital excitations associated with distinctly different energy scales. The
spin and orbital dynamical response functions calculated within the dynamical
mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Our
results highlight the Hund metal nature of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and provide key
information for the understanding of its unconventional superconductivity.

The newly synthesized BeN4 monolayer has introduced a novel group of 2D
materials called nitrogen-rich 2D materials. In the present study, the
anisotropic mechanical and thermal properties of three members of this group,
BeN4, MgN4, and PtN4, are investigated. To this end, a machine learning-based
interatomic potential (MLIP) is developed on the basis of the moment tensor
potential (MTP) method and utilized in classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation. Mechanical properties are calculated by extracting the
stress-strain curve and thermal properties by non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD) method. Acquired results show the anisotropic elastic modulus
and lattice thermal conductivity of these materials. Generally, elastic modulus
and thermal conductivity in the armchair direction are higher than in the
zigzag direction. Also, the elastic anisotropy is almost constant at every
temperature for BeN4 and MgN4, while for PtN4, this parameter is decreased by
increasing the temperature. The findings of this research are not only evidence
of the application of machine learning in MD simulations, but also provide
information on the basic anisotropic mechanical and thermal properties of these
newly discovered 2D nanomaterials.

<h3>Tuning Structural and Electro-Magnetic Properties of Epitaxial SrRuO3  through Ba-Substitution</h3>

<br>
<br>
The perovskite ruthenates (ARuO3, A = Ca, Ba, or Sr) exhibit unique
properties owing to a subtle interplay of crystal structure and electronic-spin
degrees of freedom. Here, we demonstrate an intriguing continuous tuning of
crystal symmetry from orthorhombic to tetragonal (no octahedral rotations)
phases in epitaxial SrRuO3 achieved via Ba-substitution (Sr1-xBaxRuO3 with 0 <
x < 0.7). This structural tuning leads to competing effects between RuO6
octahedral bond angle and Ru-O bond length, directly impacting the
ferromagnetism in the system. An initial Ba-substitution to SrRuO3 not only
changes the ferromagnetic properties, but also tunes the perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy via flattening the Ru-O-Ru bond angle (to 180{\deg}), resulting in
the maximum Curie temperature and an extinction of RuO6 rotational distortions
at x ~ 0.20. Further increasing x gradually enhances the tetragonal distortion,
resulting in the tuning of Ru-4d orbital occupancy and suppression of
ferromagnetism. Our results demonstrate that isovalent substitution of the
A-site cations significantly and controllably impacts both electronic and
magnetic properties of perovskite oxides.

<h3>Cyclic Superconducting Quantum Refrigerators Using Guided Fluxon  Propagation</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose cyclic quantum refrigeration in solid-state, employing a gas of
magnetic field vortices in a type-II superconductor -- also known as fluxons --
as the cooling agent. Refrigeration cycles are realized by envisioning a
racetrack geometry consisting of both adiabatic and isothermal arms, etched
into a type-II superconductor. The guided propagation of fluxons in the
racetrack is achieved by applying an external electrical current, in a Corbino
geometry, through the sample. A gradient of magnetic field is set across the
racetrack allowing one to adiabatically cool down and heat up the fluxons,
which subsequently exchange heat with the cold, and hot reservoirs,
respectively. We characterize the steady state of refrigeration cycles
thermodynamically for both $s-$wave and $d-$wave pairing symmetries, and
present their figures of merit such as the cooling power delivered, and the
coefficient of performance. Our cooling principle can offer significant cooling
for on-chip micro-refrigeration purposes, by locally cooling below the base
temperatures achievable in a conventional dilution refrigerator. We estimate
$10\mathrm{nW}/\mathrm{mm}^2$ of cooling power per unit area under typical
operating conditions. Integrating the fluxon fridge to quantum circuits can
enhance their coherence time by locally suppressing thermal fluctuations, and
improve the efficiency of single photon detectors and charge sensors.

The reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method is widely used in structural modelling
and analysis of experimental data. More recently, RMC has been applied to the
calculation of equilibrium thermodynamic properties and dynamic problems. These
studies point to the importance of properly converging RMC calculations and
understanding the relaxation behavior in RMC. From our detailed RMC
calculations, we show that the relaxation comprises of both fast and slow
aspects. A metric is introduced to assess whether fast equilibration is
achieved, i.e., detailed balance condition is satisfied. The metric,
essentially an equilibrium constant for RMC, is used as a test for
quasi-equilibration. The slow evolution is analogous to glassy materials, i.e.,
it is characterized empirically in terms of the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)
function, i.e., stretched exponentials. This feature can be exploited to
estimate the convergence error or to extrapolate statistical quantities from
short RMC calculations.

We demonstrate the application of artificial neural network (ANN) models to
reverse Monte Carlo based thermodynamic calculations. Adsorption isotherms are
generated for 2D square and triangular lattices. These lattices are considered
because of their importance to catalytic applications. In general,
configurational free energy terms that arise from adsorbate arrangements are
challenging to handle and are typically evaluated using computationally
expensive Monte Carlo simulations. We show that a combination of reverse Monte
Carlo (RMC) and ANN model can provide an accurate estimate of the
configurational free energy. The ANN model is trained/constructed using data
generated with the help of RMC simulations. Adsorption isotherms are accurately
obtained for a range of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, coverages and
temperatures within few seconds on a desktop computer using this method. The
results are validated by comparing to MC calculations. Additionally, H
adsorption on Ni(100) surface is studied using the ANN/RMC approach.

The phase diagram of ice is complex and contains many phases, but the most
common (frozen water at ambient pressure, also known as 1h ice) is a non-polar
material despite individual water molecules being polar themselves1,2.
Consequently, ice is not piezoelectric and does not generate electricity under
pressure3. In theory, however, ice can be flexoelectric4,5 and should be able
to polarize under bending. Here we report the measurement of the
flexoelectricity of ice, which turns out to be comparable with that of
benchmark dielectric ceramics such as SrTiO3 or TiO2. In addition, thanks to
the sensitivity of flexoelectricity to surface boundary conditions, the
experiments have revealed a phase transition around -110 {\deg}C (163 K) in the
surface of bulk ice. Besides potential applications for low-cost
transducers/energy harvesters made at the point-of-need by freezing water in
cold environments, we show that the flexoelectricity of ice has quantifiable
repercussions for electrifications occurring in natural phenomena.

A bulk material without inversion symmetry can generate a direct current
under uniform illumination. This interface-free current generation mechanism,
referred to as the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), has the potential to
overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit of traditional solar cells based on
$p$-$n$ junctions. Here, we explore the shift current generation, a major
mechanism responsible for the BPVE, in single-element two-dimensional
ferroelectrics represented by phosphorene-like monolayers of As, Sb, and Bi.
The strong covalency and large joint density of states afforded by these
elemental 2D materials give rise to colossal shift currents, outperforming many
state-of-the-art materials over a wide range of wavelengths including the
visible light spectrum. For a given frequency and polarization of an incoming
light, we find that the shift current, due to its topological nature, depends
sensitively on the details of the Bloch wave functions. It is crucial to
consider the electronic exchange-correlation potential beyond the generalized
gradient approximation as well as the spin-orbit interaction in density
functional theory calculations to obtain reliable photon frequency-dependent
shift current responses.

We study the electronic transport properties of a superconductor (S) with a
mixed s+p-wave pairing attached to a ferromagnetic metal (F) and a normal
electrode (N) in an SFN configuration. Using the quasiclassical Green's
function method, we compute the differential conductance $\sigma$ of the
junction and demonstrate its dependence on the direction of the exchange field
relative to the direction of the d-vector of the pair potential. If the p-wave
triplet dominates the pairing, the zero bias conductance depends on the
relative direction between the triplet d-vector and the exchange field. In
contrast, if the s-wave singlet dominates the pairing, the zero bias
conductance is isotropic with respect to the field direction. Furthermore, at
zero temperature, the zero bias conductance height can only take two values as
a function of $r$, the parameter quantifying the relative amount of s- and
p-wave pairing, with an abrupt change at $r=1$ when the superconductor goes
from a singlet to triplet dominated ground state. Moreover, we show that the
relative amount of s- and p-wave pairing, can be estimated from the dependence
of the finite bias conductance on the exchange field direction. Our results
provide a way to characterize parity-mixed superconductors performing
electrical measurements.

<h3>Extrinsic to intrinsic mechanism crossover of anomalous Hall effect in  the Ir-doped MnPtSn Heusler system</h3>

Recent findings of large anomalous Hall signal in nonferromagnetic and
nonferrimagnetic materials suggest that the magnetization of the system is not
a critical component for the realization of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE).
Here, we present a combined theoretical and experimental study demonstrating
the evolution of different mechanisms of AHE in a cubic Heusler system
MnPt$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$Sn. With the help of magnetization and neutron diffraction
studies, we show that the substitution of nonmagnetic Ir in place of Pt
significantly reduces the net magnetic moment from 4.17 $ \mu _B$/f.u. in
MnPtSn to 2.78 $ \mu _B$/f.u. for MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. In contrast, the
anomalous Hall resistivity is enhanced by nearly three times from 1.6 $ \mu
\Omega $ cm in MnPtSn to about 5 $ \mu \Omega $ cm for
MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn. The power law analysis of the Hall resistivity data
suggests that the extrinsic contribution of AHE that dominates in the case of
the parent MnPtSn almost vanishes for MnPt$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$Sn, where the
intrinsic mechanism plays the major role. The experimental results are well
supported by our theoretical study, which shows a considerable enhancement of
the spin-orbit coupling when Ir is introduced into the system. Our finding of a
crossover of the anomalous Hall effect with chemical engineering is a major
contribution toward the recent interest in controlling the band topology of
topological materials, both in bulk and thin-film forms.

Employing tight-binding model we investigate the effects of a uniform
Y-shaped Kekule lattice distortion on the electronic spectrum and optical
conductivity of graphene. We derive a low-energy effective Hamiltonian which is
found to be in excellent agreement with one calculated from a diagonalization
of the full tight-binding Hamiltonian. Then using the low-energy Hamiltonian
and Kubo formula we obtain an analytical expression for the real part of the
optical conductivity used to explore the effects of chemical potential,
temperature and on-site and hopping energy deviations in details. In particular
we find that Y-shaped Kekue-patterned graphene at finite chemical potential
displays a large optical response called band nesting resonance. This effect is
shown to be robust against increasing temperature, facilitating its detection
as an optical signature for the Y-shaped Kekule distortion even at room
temperature.

We analyse the scaling properties of the energy spectra in fully developed
incompressible turbulence in forced, rotating fluids in three dimensions (3D),
which are believed to be characterised by universal scaling exponents in the
inertial range. To elucidate the scaling regimes, we set up a scaling analysis
of the 3D Navier-Stokes equation for a rotating fluid that is driven by
large-scale external forces. We use scaling arguments to extract the scaling
exponents, which characterise the different scaling regimes of the energy
spectra. We speculate on the intriguing possibility of two-dimensionalisation
of 3D rotating turbulence within our scaling theory. Our results can be tested
in large scale simulations and relevant laboratory-based experiments.

<br>
<br>
Magnetoresistance, that is, the change of the resistance with the magnetic
field, is usually a quadratic function of the field strength. A linear
magnetoresistance usually reveal extraordinary properties of a system. In the
quantum limit where only the lowest Landau band is occupied, a quantum linear
magnetoresistance was believed to be the signature of the Weyl fermions with 3D
linear dispersion. Here, we comparatively investigate the quantum-limit
magnetoresistance of systems with different band dispersions as well as
different types of impurities. We find that the magnetoresistance can also be
linear for the quadratic energy dispersion. We show that both longitudinal and
transverse magnetoresistance can be linear if long-range-Gaussian-type
impurities dominate, but Coulomb-type impurities can only induce linear
transverse magnetoresistance. Our findings well explain some of the linear
magnetoresistance observed in the experiments and provide new insights to the
understanding of quantum-limit magnetoresistance.

quantum-device design, as much effort has been devoted to its engineering and
manipulation. Here we experimentally demonstrate non-reciprocal transport in a
two-dimensional quantum walk of photons, where the directional propagation is
highly tunable through dissipation and synthetic magnetic flux. The
non-reciprocal dynamics hereof is a manifestation of the non-Hermitian skin
effect, with its direction continuously adjustable through the photon-loss
parameters. By contrast, the synthetic flux originates from an engineered
geometric phase, which competes with the non-Hermitian skin effect through
magnetic confinement. We further demonstrate how the non-reciprocity and
synthetic flux impact the dynamics of the Floquet topological edge modes along
an engineered boundary. Our results exemplify an intriguing strategy for
achieving tunable non-reciprocal transport, highlighting the interplay of
non-Hermiticity and gauge fields in quantum systems of higher dimensions.

We study the effects of quasidisorder and Anderson disorder on a two
dimensional topological superconductor with an applied external magnetic field.
The cases of a $p$-wave superconductor and a noncentrosymmetric superconductor
with mixed $p$ and $s$-wave pairings and Rashba spin-orbit coupling are
studied. We show that, for a perpendicular magnetic field, the introduction of
quasidisorder leads to the appearance of topological phases in new regions,
characterised by an integer value of the Chern number. For a parallel magnetic
field, we identify regimes with the appearance of new Majorana flat bands and
also new unidirectional Majorana edge states, as quasidisorder is introduced.
We show that the Majorana flat bands have a quantized Berry phase of $\pi$ and
identify it as a topological invariant. Two topological transitions are
identified and the values of the critical exponents $z$ and $\nu$ are obtained.
The fractal nature of the eigenstates is discussed both for Anderson disorder
and Aubry-Andr\'e disorder.

The purpose of this study is to inspect the combined effect of reinforcement
shape and packing on the macroscopic behaviour of particulate composites. The
introduced micromechanical approach modifies the Morphologically Representative
Pattern scheme with the Replacement Mori-Tanaka Model. The statistical volume
elements have randomly placed inclusions with a selected shape. Four shapes of
inhomogeneities are studied: a sphere, a prolate spheroid, three prolate
spheroids crossing at right angles, and a drilled spheroid. The concentration
tensors of non-ellipsoidal inhomogeneities are found numerically using simple
simulations of a single particle. The extension to the regime of non-linear
material behaviour is performed by employing the tangent or secant incremental
linearization of the material response. The results are compared with the
outcomes of numerical simulations and predictions of the classical mean-field
models based on the Eshelby solution, e.g., the Mori-Tanaka model or the
Self-Consistent scheme. It is found that the proposed modification of the
Morphologically Representative Pattern approach can be used as an alternative
to computational homogenization in the case of elastic-plastic composites with
different shapes and packings of particles.

Additive Manufacturing (AM) has enabled the fabrication of metallic cellular
materials that are of interest in the design of lightweight impact resistant
structures. However, there is a need to understand the interactions between:
(i) the material architecture, (ii) the AM process parameters, and (iii) the
as-built geometry, microstructure and energy absorbing properties. In this
work, we investigate the quasi-static and dynamic behaviour of cellular
materials manufactured from 316L stainless steel using laser powder bed fusion
(LPBF). Four cellular architectures are considered (octet lattice,
lattice-walled square honeycomb, origami and square honeycomb), as well as
three sets of AM process parameters, characterised by laser powers of 50, 125
and 200 W. The exposure time is adjusted to deliver the same total heat input.
The 125 W case leads to material with the highest strength and ductility. The
cellular materials with this process variant match their nominal densities most
closely, and have the highest strength and energy absorption. Either reducing
(50 W) or increasing (200 W) the power leads to a significant increase in
porosity, reducing strength and energy absorption. However, we find that
changes due to process-induced porosity have a smaller influence than those
resulting from the choice of cellular architecture.

Recent studies of secondary electron (SE) emission in scanning transmission
electron microscopes suggest that material's properties such as electrical
conductivity, connectivity, and work function can be probed with atomic scale
resolution using a technique known as secondary electron e-beam-induced current
(SEEBIC). Here, we apply the SEEBIC imaging technique to a stacked 2D
heterostructure device to reveal the spatially resolved electron orbital
ionization cross section of an encapsulated WSe2 layer. We find that the double
Se lattice site shows higher emission than the W site, which is at odds with
first-principles modelling of ionization of an isolated WSe2 cluster. These
results illustrate that atomic level SEEBIC contrast within a single material
is possible and that an enhanced understanding of atomic scale SE emission is
required to account for the observed contrast. In turn, this suggests that
subtle information about interlayer bonding and the effect on electron orbitals
can be directly revealed with this technique.

<h3>Symmetry Classification of Many-Body Lindbladians: Tenfold Way and  Beyond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00474" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00474</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas Sá, Pedro Ribeiro, Tomaž Prosen</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform a systematic symmetry classification of many-body Lindblad
superoperators describing general (interacting) open quantum systems coupled to
a Markovian environment. Our classification is based on the behaviour of the
many-body Lindbladian under antiunitary symmetries and unitary involutions. We
find that Hermiticity preservation reduces the number of symmetry classes,
while trace preservation and complete positivity do not, and that the set of
admissible classes depends on the presence of additional unitary symmetries: in
their absence or in sectors containing steady states, many-body Lindbladians
belong to one of ten non-Hermitian symmetry classes; if however, there are
additional symmetries and we consider non-steady-state sectors, they belong to
a different set of 18 classes. In both cases, it does not include any classes
with Kramer's degeneracy. Remarkably, our classification admits a
straightforward generalization to the case of non-Markovian, and even
non-trace-preserving, open quantum dynamics. While the abstract classification
is completely general, we then apply it to general (long-range, interacting,
spatially inhomogeneous) spin-$1/2$ chains. We explicitly build examples in all
ten classes of Lindbladians in steady-state sectors, describing standard
physical processes such as dephasing, spin injection and absorption, and
incoherent hopping, thus illustrating the relevance of our classification for
practical physics applications. Finally, we show that the examples in each
class display unique random-matrix correlations. To fully resolve all
symmetries, we employ the combined analysis of bulk complex spacing ratios and
the overlap of eigenvector pairs related by symmetry operations. We further
find that statistics of levels constrained onto the real and imaginary axes,
and close to the origin, are not universal due to spontaneous breaking of
Lindbladian PT symmetry.

<h3>How droplets dry on stretched soft substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00485</a>

<br>
<br>
Liquid droplets usually wet smooth and homogeneous substrates isotropically.
Recent research works have revealed that droplets sit, slide and spread
anisotropically on uniaxially stretched soft substrates, showing an enhanced
wettability and contact line mobility along the stretching direction. This
phenomenon arises from the anisotropic deformation of the substrate below the
contact line. Here, we investigate how the stretching of soft substrates
affects droplets drying. We observe that water droplet evaporates with an
elongated non-circular contact line on the stretched substrates and switches
the elongation direction during evaporation. The contact line velocity and its
temporal evolution depend on the orientation of the contact line relative to
the stretching direction. On the substrate stretched by 250%, the contact line
recedes about 20% of the droplet lifetime earlier along the stretching
direction and faster than its perpendicular direction. When nanoparticles are
added into the liquid, the circular deposition pattern, i.e., the so-called
coffee-ring, becomes elongated along the direction perpendicular to the
stretching direction. Particularly, such non-circular deposition pattern
exhibits periodic height gradients along its rim. The finer structure of the
pattern can be controlled by applying different stretching ratios to the soft
substrate and thus are correlated to the anisotropic surface stresses near the
contact line.

We study analytically and numerically a couple of paradigmatic spin models,
each described in terms of two sets of variables attached to two different
thermal baths with characteristic timescales $T$ and $\tau$ and inverse
temperatures $B$ and $\beta$. In the limit in which one bath becomes extremely
slow ($\tau \to \infty$), such models amount to a paramagnet and to a
one-dimensional ferromagnet, in contact with a single bath. We show that these
systems reach a stationary state in a finite time for any choice of $B$ and
$\beta$. We determine the non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation
between the autocorrelation and the response function in such state and, from
that, we discuss if and how thermalization with the two baths occurs and the
emergence of a non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation ratio.

<br>
<br>
We study thermalization of transverse field Ising chain with power law
decaying interaction $\sim 1/r^{\alpha}$ following a global quantum quench of
the transverse field to two different dynamical regimes. We quantify the
thermalization behavior by comparing the full probability distribution function
(PDF) of the evolving states with the corresponding thermal state given by the
Gibbs canonical ensemble (GCE). To this end, we use matrix product state (MPS)
based time dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate both
real time evolution following a global quantum quench and the finite
temperature density operator. We observe that thermalization is strongly
suppressed in the region with strong confinement for all the interaction
strength $\alpha$ considered whereas thermalization occurs in the region with
weak confinement.

Bernal bilayer graphene exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the
infrared with an electric field. We show that sublattice odd commensurate
twisted bilayer graphene (C-TBG) exhibits a band gap that is tunable through
the terahertz with an electric field. We show that from the perspective of
terahertz optics the sublattice odd and even forms of C-TBG are "inflated"
versions of Bernal and AA stacked bilayer graphene respectively with energy
scales reduced by a factor of 110 for the 21.79 degree commensurate unit cell.
This lower energy scale is accompanied by a correspondingly smaller gate
voltage, which means that the strong-field regime is more easily accessible
than in the Bernal case. Finally, we show that the interlayer coherence energy
is a directly accessible experimental quantity through the position of a
power-law divergence in the optical conductivity.

Silicon carbide has excellent physical properties, such as high stability,
thermal conductivity, and mechanical strength. It has been widely used in
high-power devices, catalysis, material processing, and other fields and is of
great significance in basic discipline research. We used crystal structure
search and first principles calculation to predict four new silicon carbide
structures stabilized within 3TPa. Pnma (SiC) replaces B1 (SiC) above 2.6TPa,
and the new component Si3C2 becomes the most stable after 2.5TPa. P4/mbm phase
Si3C2 under high pressure has electrode characteristics. The silicon-carbide
structure is metallic in the study pressure range, and the electrons contribute
most of the thermal conductivity, which is of great significance for the
thermal evolution of silicon-carbide-like terrestrial planets. In addition, we
propose a new silicon carbide planetary model and calculate the sound velocity
of Si3C2 under TPa. Therefore, our research has deepened the understanding of
silicon-carbide terrestrial planets' internal structure and thermal evolution,
explored the complex silicon-carbide phase space, and enriched the
silicon-carbide phase diagram.

On the basis of density functional theory calculations we predict Weyl points
in rhombohedral structure of PtNiO$_2$ having symmorphic symmetry. From the
formation energy and phonon calculations, PtNiO$_2$ is found to be structurally
stable. The magnetic ground state is ferromagnetic with an effective magnetic
moment of 1.01 $\mu_B$ per unit cell. The electronic structure shows major
contributions from Pt-$5d$, Ni-$3d$ and O-$2p$ orbitals with band crossing
close to the Fermi level. The orbital contribution around 8 eV above the Fermi
level are from the Pt-$s,p$ orbitals forming a kagome like electronic structure
confirmed by surface Fermi surface spectral function. We found 20 pairs of
confirmed Weyl nodes along the magnetic easy axis [100]. These results are
expected to provide a useful and exciting platform for exploring and
understanding the magnetic Weyl physics in delafossites.

<br>
We develop a theory of symmetry in open quantum systems. Using the
operator-state mapping, we characterize symmetry of Liouvillian superoperators
for the open quantum dynamics by symmetry of operators in the double Hilbert
space and apply the 38-fold internal-symmetry classification of non-Hermitian
operators. We find rich symmetry classification due to the interplay between
symmetry in the corresponding closed quantum systems and symmetry inherent in
the construction of the Liouvillian superoperators. As an illustrative example
of open quantum bosonic systems, we study symmetry classes of dissipative
quantum spin models. For open quantum fermionic systems, we develop the
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ classification of fermion parity symmetry and antiunitary
symmetry in the double Hilbert space, which contrasts with the $\mathbb{Z}_8$
classification in closed quantum systems. We also develop the symmetry
classification of open quantum fermionic many-body systems -- a dissipative
generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model described by the Lindblad
master equation. We establish the periodic tables of the SYK Lindbladians and
elucidate the difference from the SYK Hamiltonians. Furthermore, from extensive
numerical calculations, we study its complex-spectral statistics and
demonstrate dissipative quantum chaos enriched by symmetry.

We consider dense, associative neural-networks trained by a teacher (i.e.,
with supervision) and we investigate their computational capabilities
analytically, via statistical-mechanics of spin glasses, and numerically, via
Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we obtain a phase diagram summarizing
their performance as a function of the control parameters such as quality and
quantity of the training dataset, network storage and noise, that is valid in
the limit of large network size and structureless datasets: these networks may
work in a ultra-storage regime (where they can handle a huge amount of
patterns, if compared with shallow neural networks) or in a ultra-detection
regime (where they can perform pattern recognition at prohibitive
signal-to-noise ratios, if compared with shallow neural networks). Guided by
the random theory as a reference framework, we also test numerically learning,
storing and retrieval capabilities shown by these networks on structured
datasets as MNist and Fashion MNist. As technical remarks, from the analytic
side, we implement large deviations and stability analysis within Guerra's
interpolation to tackle the not-Gaussian distributions involved in the
post-synaptic potentials while, from the computational counterpart, we insert
Plefka approximation in the Monte Carlo scheme, to speed up the evaluation of
the synaptic tensors, overall obtaining a novel and broad approach to
investigate supervised learning in neural networks, beyond the shallow limit,
in general.

The current burst in research activities on disordered semiconductors calls
for the development of appropriate theoretical tools that reveal the features
of electron states in random potentials while avoiding the time-consuming
numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. Among various approaches
suggested so far, the low-pass filter approach of Halperin and Lax (HL) and the
so-called localization landscape technique (LLT) have received most recognition
in the community. We prove that the HL approach becomes equivalent to the LLT
for the specific case of a Lorentzian filter when applied to the Schr\"odinger
equation with a constant mass. Advantageously, the low-pass filter approach
allows further optimization beyond the Lorentzian shape. We propose the global
HL filter as optimal filter with only a single length scale, namely, the size
of the localized wave packets. As an application, we design an optimized
potential landscape for a (semi-)classical calculation of the number of
strongly localized states that faithfully reproduce the exact solution for a
random white-noise potential in one dimension.

<br>
The space- and temperature-dependent electron distribution $n(\mathbf r,T)$
is essential for the theoretical description of the opto-electronic properties
of disordered semiconductors. We present two powerful techniques to access
$n(\mathbf r,T)$ without solving the Schr\"odinger equation. First, we derive
the density for non-degenerate electrons by applying the Hamiltonian
recursively to random wave functions (RWF). Second, we obtain a
temperature-dependent effective potential from the application of a universal
low-pass filter (ULF) to the random potential acting on the charge carriers in
disordered media. Thereby, the full quantum-mechanical problem is reduced to
the quasi-classical description of $n(\mathbf r,T)$ in an effective potential.
We numerically verify both approaches by comparison with the exact
quantum-mechanical solution. Both approaches prove superior to the widely used
localization landscape theory (LLT) when we compare our approximate results for
the charge carrier density and mobility at elevated temperatures obtained by
RWF, ULF, and LLT with those from the exact solution of the Schr\"odinger
equation.

We measured the flux-flow Hall effect in a multi-band superconductor FeSe
pure single crystal to investigate the nature of the vortex core state by means
of the cross-shaped bimodal cavity technique. We found that the flux-flow Hall
angle of FeSe is about 0.5 at low temperatures, which is equal to or smaller
than that evaluated by the effective viscous drag coefficient measurements, and
the Hall angle, as a function of the magnetic field, behaves in a different
manner from the viscous drag coefficient measurements. These features contrast
the cuprate superconductors. The conductivity tensor of multi-band
superconductros that are contributed from holes and eloctrons explains the
observed behaviors. This means that the observed results are due to partial
cancellation of the flux-flow Hall voltage by the electrons and holes.
Therefore, our study is the first demonstration of a novel feature
characteristic of flux flow in multi-band superconductors.

Gapless materials in electronic contact with superconductors acquire
proximity-induced superconductivity in a region near the interface. Numerous
proposals build on this addition of electron pairing to originally
non-superconducting systems like ferromagnets and predict intriguing quantum
phases of matter, including topological-, odd-frequency-, or nodal-point
superconductivity. However, atomic-scale experimental investigations of the
microscopic mechanisms leading to proximity-induced Cooper pairing in surface
or interface states are missing. Here, we investigate the most miniature
example of the proximity effect on only a single quantum level of a surface
state confined in a quantum corral on a superconducting substrate, built
atom-by-atom by a scanning tunneling microscope. Whenever an eigenmode of the
corral is pitched close to the Fermi energy by adjusting the corral's size, a
pair of particle-hole symmetric states enters the superconductor's gap. We
identify the in-gap states as scattering resonances theoretically predicted 50
years ago by Machida and Shibata, which had so far eluded detection. We further
show that the observed anticrossings of the in-gap states indicate
proximity-induced pairing in the quantum corral's eigenmodes. Our results have
direct consequences on the interpretation of in-gap states in unconventional or
topological superconductors, corroborate concepts to induce superconductivity
into a single quantum level and further pave the way towards superconducting
artificial lattices.

First isolated in 2004, graphene monolayers display unique properties and
promising technological potential in next generation electronics,
optoelectronics, and energy storage. The simple yet effective methodology,
mechanical exfoliation followed by optical microscopy inspection, used for
fabricating graphene has been exploited to discover many more two-dimensional
(2D) atomic crystals which show distinct physical properties from their bulk
counterpart, opening the new era of materials research. However, manual
inspection of optical images to identify 2D flakes has the clear drawback of
low-throughput and hence is impractical for any scale-up applications of 2D
samples, albert their fascinating physical properties. Recent integration of
high-performance machine-learning, usually deep learning, techniques with
optical microscopy has accelerated flake identification. Despite the
advancement brought by deep learning algorithms, their high computational
complexities, large dataset requirements, and more importantly, opaque
decision-making processes limit their accessibilities. As an alternative, we
investigate more transparent tree-based machine-learning algorithms with
features that mimic color contrast for the automated identification of
exfoliated 2D atomic crystals (e.g., MoSe2) under different optical settings.
We compare the success and physical nature of the decisions of these tree-based
algorithms to ResNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We show that
decision trees, gradient boosted decision trees, and random forests can
successfully classify optical images of thin materials with transparent
decisions that rely on physical image features and do not suffer from extreme
overfitting and large dataset requirements.

Supersymmetry and supergravity were invented in the 1970s to solve
fundamental problems in high-energy physics. Even though neither of these ideas
has yet been confirmed in high-energy and cosmology experiments, they have been
beneficial in constructing numerous theoretical models, including superstring
theory. Despite the absence of supersymmetry in particle physics, it can
potentially emerge in exotic phases of strongly correlated condensed matter
systems. In this paper, we propose a supergravity model that describes the
low-energy physics of the Haldane-Rezayi state, a gapless quantum Hall state
that occurs in a half-filled Landau level. We show that the corresponding edge
modes of the Haldane-Rezayi state and the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra
appear naturally in the supergravity model. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical findings with numerical exact diagonalization calculations that
support the appearance of the emergent graviton and gravitino excitations in
the Haldane-Rezayi state.

We study the transmission of Dirac fermions in graphene through a tilted
barrier potential in the presence of a laser field. By using Floquet theory, we
solve the Dirac equation and then obtain the energy spectrum. The boundary
conditions together with the transfer matrix method allow us to determine the
transmission probabilities corresponding to all energy bands. For numerical
purposes, we only study the central band $l=0$ and the two first side bands
$l=\pm 1$ under various conditions. It has been discovered that the laser field
and potential influence the amplitude and shape of the transmission
probabilities. In fact, different oscillations are observed, the Klein effect
is still present, and the transmission of all bands is almost zero inside the
barrier.

We review recent progress in optimal control in stochastic thermodynamics.
Theoretical advances provide in-depth insight into minimum-dissipation control
with either full or limited (parametric) control, and spanning the limits from
slow to fast driving and from weak to strong driving. Known exact solutions
give a window into the properties of minimum-dissipation control, which are
reproduced by approximate methods in the relevant limits. Connections between
optimal-transport theory and minimum-dissipation protocols under full control
give deep insight into the properties of optimal control and place bounds on
the dissipation of thermodynamic processes. Since minimum-dissipation protocols
are relatively well understood and advanced approximation methods and numerical
techniques for estimating minimum-dissipation protocols have been developed,
now is an opportune time for application to chemical and biological systems.

model, which contains anisotropic nearest-neighbour couplings $J_{1x}$ and
$J_{1y}$, and next nearest-neighbour coupling $J_2$. For small $J_{1y}/J_{1x}$,
by tuning $J_2$, a direct continuous transition between the AFM and
valence-bond solid (VBS) phase is observed. With growing $J_{1y}/J_{1x}$, a
gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase gradually emerges in between the AFM
and VBS phase. We observe an emergent O(4) symmetry along the AFM-VBS
transition line, which is consistent with the prediction of the deconfined
quantum critical point (DQCP) theory. Most surprisingly, we find that such an
emergent O(4) symmetry still holds for the whole QSL-VBS transition line. These
findings reveal the intrinsic relationship between QSL and DQCP, which also
provide us with a very strong constraint on quantum field theory description of
the QSL phase. The phase diagram and critical exponents therein are also of
direct relevance to future experiments on frustrated magnets.

The growing field of quantum information technology requires propagation of
information over long distances with efficient readout mechanisms. Excitonic
quantum fluids have emerged as a powerful platform for the realization of such
long-range transport due to their straightforward electro-optical conversion.
In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the coupling
between spin and valley provides exciting opportunities for harnessing,
manipulating and storing bits of information. However, the large inhomogeneity
of single layer TMDs cannot be compensated by the weak mutual interaction of
bright excitons, hindering spin-valley transport. Nonetheless, the rich band
structure of monolayer TMDs supports dark excitonic states with a permanent
out-of-plane dipole, strong binding energy and long lifetime, ideally suited to
overcome these challenges. Here we show that dark excitons can be used as
sturdy information carriers due to their strong interaction that results in
diffusion over several micrometers. Experiments conducted in engineered
potential energy landscapes show that this repulsion-driven propagation is
robust across non-uniform samples including over uphill energy landscapes, and
that the information readout is mediated by chiral phonons. The long-range
propagation of dark states provides a new concept of excitonic devices for
applications in both classical and quantum information technology.

Immersed in external magnetic fields, strained graphene constitutes an ideal
tabletop setup, manifesting a confluence of Abelian ($B$) and axial ($b$)
magnetic fields. In such a system, here we numerically compute two-terminal
conductance ($G$), and four- as well as six-terminal Hall conductivity
($\sigma_{xy}$) for spinless fermions. In unstrained graphene ($b=0$), the
$B$-field produces quantized plateaus at $G=\pm |\sigma_{xy}|=(2n+1) e^2/h$,
where $n=0,1,2, \cdots$. Strain induced $b$-field lifts the two-fold valley
degeneracy of higher Landau levels and leads to the formation of additional
even integer plateaus at $G=\pm |\sigma_{xy}|= (2,4,\cdots)e^2/h$, when $B>b$.
While the same sequence of plateaus is observed for $G$ when $b>B$, any clear
quantization of $\sigma_{xy}$ in Hall bar geometries is absent due to numerical
instability. A plateau at $G=\sigma_{xy}=0$ always appears with the onset of a
charge-density-wave order, causing a staggered pattern of fermionic density
between two sublattices of honeycomb lattice.
