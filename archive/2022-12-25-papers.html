<h3>Nucleation of chemically active droplets</h3>

Driven chemical reactions can control the macroscopic properties of droplets,
like their size. Such active droplets are critical in structuring the interior
of biological cells. Cells also need to control where and when droplets appear,
so they need to control droplet nucleation. Our numerical simulations
demonstrate that reactions generally suppress nucleation if they stabilize the
homogeneous state. An equilibrium surrogate model reveals that reactions
increase the effective energy barrier of nucleation, enabling quantitative
predictions of the increased nucleation times. Moreover, the surrogate model
allows us to construct a phase diagram, which summarizes how reactions affect
the stability of the homogeneous phase and the droplet state. This simple
picture provides accurate predictions of how driven reactions delay nucleation,
which is relevant for understanding droplets in biological cells and chemical
engineering.

The interplay between spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and magnetic order is
currently one of the most active research fields in condensed matter physics
and leading the search for materials with novel and tunable magnetic and spin
properties. Here we report on a variety of unexpected and unique observations
in thin multiferroic \Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te films. The ferrimagnetic order in this
ferroelectric semiconductor is found to reverse with current pulses six orders
of magnitude lower as for typical spin-orbit torque systems. Upon a switching
event, the magnetic order spreads coherently and collectively over macroscopic
distances through a correlated spin-glass state. Lastly, we present a novel
methodology to controllably harness this stochastic magnetization dynamics,
allowing us to detect spatiotemporal nucleation of topological spin textures we
term ``skyrmiverres''.

<h3>Surface Coverage Dynamics for Reversible Dissociative Adsorption on  Finite Linear Lattices</h3>

Unlike molecular (or non-dissociative) adsorption, dissociative adsorption
introduces correlations between neighboring sites. We study the resulting
effects on surface coverage dynamics for reversible dissociative adsorption of
dimers on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice system consisting of independent
strips of reactive sites. We first show that the effect of finite system size
on surface coverage dynamics becomes significant when dissociative adsorption
is much slower or faster than the corresponding associative desorption. To this
end, we derive analytic formulas for the equilibrium surface coverage and the
correlation coefficient for the occupancy of neighboring sites as a function of
system size (more specifically, the number of reactive sites in a strip) and
the ratio of the adsorption and desorprtion rates. Second, we show that the
validity of cluster-expansion-based approximations also largely depends on the
ratio of adsorption and desorprtion rates. While the mean-field approximation
and pair approximation predict the correct equilibrium surface coverage, they
fail to predict the temporal growth of the surface coverage from an initially
unoccupied lattice when adsorption is much slower than desorption. This implies
that site correlation cannot be naively ignored nor approximated using a simple
expression during a nonequilibrium process of dissociative adsorption. We show
that the surface diffusion of adsorbed atoms can reduce correlations between
sites and the fast-diffusion limit can be described by the mean-field
approximation that assumes there is no correlation between sites. We also
present kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results for the validation of our
analytic results as well as the comparison of the surface coverage growth with
the cluster-expansion-based approximations.

<h3>Field Theory of Active Brownian Particles in Potentials</h3>

The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model exemplifies a wide class of active
matter particles. In this work, we demonstrate how this model can be cast into
a field theory in both two and three dimensions. Our aim is manifold: we wish
both to extract useful features of the system, as well as to build a framework
which can be used to study more complex systems involving ABPs, such as those
involving interaction. Using the two-dimensional model as a template, we
calculate the mean squared displacement exactly, and the one-point density in
an external potential perturbatively. We show how the effective diffusion
constant appears in the barometric density formula to leading order, and
determine the corrections to it. We repeat the calculation in three dimensions,
clearly a more challenging setup. Comparing different ways to capture the
self-propulsion, we find that its perturbative treatment results in more
tractable derivations without loss of exactness, where this is accessible.

<h3>A Continuum Model for Morphology Formation from Interacting Ternary  Mixtures: Simulation Study of the Formation and Growth of Patterns</h3>

Our interest lies in exploring the ability of a coupled nonlocal system of
two quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations to produce phase
separation patterns. The obtained patterns are referred here as morphologies.
Our target system is derived in the literature as the rigorous hydrodynamic
limit of a suitably scaled interacting particle system of Blume--Capel--type
driven by Kawasaki dynamics. The system describes in a rather implicit way the
interaction within a ternary mixture that is the macroscopic counterpart of a
mix of two populations of interacting solutes in the presence of a background
solvent. Our discussion is based on the qualitative behavior of numerical
simulations of finite volume approximations of smooth solutions to our system
and their quantitative postprocessing in terms of two indicators (correlation
and structure factor calculations). Our results show many similar features
compared to what one knows at the level of the stochastic Blume--Capel dynamics
with three interacting species. The properties of the obtained morphologies
(shape, connectivity, and so on) can play a key role in, e.g., the design of
the active layer for efficient organic solar cells.

<h3>Scattering and transport properties of the three classical Wigner-Dyson  ensembles at the Anderson transition</h3>

<br>
An extensive numerical analysis of the scattering and transport properties of
the power-law banded random matrix model (PBRM) at criticality in the presence
of orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic symmetries is presented. Our results
show a good agreement with existing analytical expressions in the metallic
regime and with heuristic relations widely used in studies of the PBRM model in
the presence of orthogonal and unitary symmetries. Moreover, our results
confirm that the multifractal behavior of disordered systems at criticality can
be probed by measuring scattering and transport properties, which is of
paramount importance from the experimental point of view. Thus, a full picture
of the scattering and transport properties of the PBRM model at criticality
corresponding to the three classical Wigner-Dyson ensembles is provided.

<h3>Dynamics of a quantum polariton vortex: Low excitation scenario</h3>

Vorticity has been traditionally investigated within the frame of many-body
phenomena; under the mean-field or coherent approaches. In the present work, we
demonstrate that the fully quantized picture describes richer dynamics at the
quantum coupling limit, where two systems exchange an indivisible excitation.
The quantum correlations intrinsic to our formalism, account for the emergence
of a family of trajectories that differs from the circular paths known in
macroscopic vorticity phenomena. This result enables the establishment of a
criterion to differentiate the behavior at the edge between the quantum and
classical polariton vortex dynamics.

<h3>Domain wall qubits on magnetic racetracks</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a scalable implementation of a quantum computer based on
hardware-efficient mobile domain walls on magnetic racetracks. In our proposal,
the quantum information is encoded in the chirality of the spin structure of
nanoscale domain walls. We estimate that these qubits are long-lived and could
be operated at sweet spots reducing possible noise sources. Single-qubit gates
are implemented by controlling the movement of the walls in magnetic nanowires,
and two-qubit entangling gates take advantage of naturally emerging
interactions between different walls. These gates are sufficient for universal
quantum computing and are fully compatible with current state-of-the-art
experiments on racetrack memories. Possible schemes for qubit readout and
initialization are also discussed.

In recent years, nanostructures with hexagonal polytypes of gold have been
synthesised, opening new possibilities in nanoscience and technology. As bulk
gold crystallizes in the \textit{fcc} phase, surface effects can play an
important role in stabilizing hexagonal gold nanostructures. Here we
investigate several hetero-structures with Ge substrate, including the
\textit{fcc} and \textit{hcp} phases of gold that have been observed
experimentally. We determine and discuss their interfacial energies and
optimized atomic arrangements, comparing the theory results with available
experimental data. Our calculations for the Au-\textit{fcc}(011)/Ge(001) show
how the presence of defects in the interface layer can help to stabilize the
atomic pattern consistent with microscopic images. The Au-\textit{hcp}/Ge
interface with the significant mismatch between two surfaces reveals large
atomic displacements, which might indicate that the (111) germanium substrate
is not responsible for the formation of the \textit{hcp} phase of gold.
Finally, analyzing the electronic properties, we demonstrate that Au/Ge systems
have metallic character but covalent-like bonding states between interfacial Ge
and Au atoms are also present.

<h3>Dynamical large deviations of linear diffusions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Linear diffusions are used to model a large number of stochastic processes in
physics, including small mechanical and electrical systems perturbed by thermal
noise, as well as Brownian particles controlled by electrical and optical
forces. Here, we use techniques from large deviation theory to study the
statistics of time-integrated functionals of linear diffusions, considering
three classes of functionals or observables relevant for nonequilibrium systems
which involve linear or quadratic integrals of the state in time. For these, we
derive exact results for the scaled cumulant generating function and the rate
function, characterizing the fluctuations of observables in the long-time
limit, and study in an exact way the set of paths or effective process that
underlies these fluctuations. The results gives a complete description of how
fluctuations arise in linear diffusions in terms of effective forces that
remain linear in the state or, alternatively, in terms of fluctuating densities
and currents that solve Riccati-type equations. We illustrate these results
using two common nonequilibrium models, namely, transverse diffusions in two
dimensions involving a non-conservative rotating force, and two interacting
particles in contact with heat baths at different temperatures.

As a result of extreme weather conditions, such as heavy precipitation,
natural hillslopes can fail dramatically; these slope failures can occur on a
dry day due to time lags between rainfall and pore-water pressure change at
depth, or even after days to years of slow-motion. While the pre-failure
deformation is sometimes apparent in retrospect, it remains challenging to
predict the sudden transition from gradual deformation (creep) to runaway
failure. We use a network science method -- multilayer modularity optimization
-- to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of deformation in a region near
the 2017 Mud Creek, California landslide. We transform satellite radar data
from the study site into a spatially-embedded network in which the nodes are
patches of ground and the edges connect the nearest neighbors, with a series of
layers representing consecutive transits of the satellite. Each edge is
weighted by the product of the local slope (susceptibility to failure) measured
from a digital elevation model and ground surface deformation (current
rheological state) from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). We
use multilayer modularity optimization to identify strongly-connected clusters
of nodes (communities) and are able to identify both the location of Mud Creek
and nearby creeping landslides which have not yet failed. We develop a metric,
community persistence, to quantify patterns of ground deformation leading up to
failure, and find that this metric increases from a baseline value in the weeks
leading up to Mud Creek's failure. These methods promise as a technique for
highlighting regions at risk of catastrophic failure.

<h3>Genuine many-body quantum scars along unstable modes in Bose-Hubbard  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12046" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12046</a>
<br>
<i>Quirin Hummel, Klaus Richter, Peter Schlagheck</i>
<br>
<br>
The notion of many-body quantum scars is associated with special eigenstates,
usually concentrated in certain parts of Hilbert space, that give rise to
robust persistent oscillations in a regime that globally exhibits
thermalization. Here we extend these studies to many-body systems possessing a
true classical limit characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic phase space,
which are not subject to any particular dynamical constraint. We demonstrate
genuine quantum scarring of wave functions concentrated in the vicinity of
unstable classical periodic mean-field modes in the paradigmatic Bose-Hubbard
model. These peculiar quantum many-body states exhibit distinct phase-space
localization about those classical modes. Their existence is consistent with
Heller's scar criterion and appears to persist in the thermodynamic
long-lattice limit. Launching quantum wave packets along such scars leads to
observable long-lasting oscillations, featuring periods that scale
asymptotically with classical Lyapunov exponents, and displaying intrinsic
irregularities that reflect the underlying chaotic dynamics, as opposed to
regular tunnel oscillations.

<h3>Breakdown of the scaling relation of anomalous Hall effect in Kondo  lattice ferromagnet USbTe</h3>

<br>
<br>
The interaction between strong correlation and Berry curvature is an open
territory of in the field of quantum materials. Here we report large anomalous
Hall conductivity in a Kondo lattice ferromagnet USbTe which is dominated by
intrinsic Berry curvature at low temperatures. However, the Berry curvature
induced anomalous Hall effect does not follow the scaling relation derived from
Fermi liquid theory. The onset of the Berry curvature contribution coincides
with the Kondo coherent temperature. Combined with ARPES measurement and DMFT
calculations, this strongly indicates that Berry curvature is hosted by the
flat bands induced by Kondo hybridization at the Fermi level. Our results
demonstrate that the Kondo coherence of the flat bands has a dramatic influence
on the low temperature physical properties associated with the Berry curvature,
calling for new theories of scaling relations of anomalous Hall effect to
account for the interaction between strong correlation and Berry curvature.

<h3>Lattice constants and magnetism of L10-ordered FePt under high pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
We studied the relationship between the lattice constant and magnetism of
L10-ordered FePt under high pressure by means of first-principles calculations
and synchrotron x-ray measurements. Based on our calculations, we found that
the c/a ratio shows an anomaly at ~ 20 GPa and that the Pt magnetic moment is
sharply suppressed at ~ 60 GPa. As for the c/a, we experimentally verified the
anomaly at ~ 20 GPa by powder x-ray diffraction. We also measured the x-ray
magnetic circular dichroism at the Pt L edge up to ~ 20 GPa. Any significant
change of the Pt magnetic moment was not observed, in agreement with the
calculations. These results thus indicate the possibility that novel magnetic
states can be created in L10-ordered FePt by lattice deformation under high
pressure.

<h3>Enhancing two-photon spontaneous emission in rare earths using graphene  and graphene nanoribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12066</a>
<br>
<i>Colin Whisler, Gregory Holdman, D. D. Yavuz, Victor W. Brar</i>
<br>
<br>
The enhancement of two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) from trivalent and
divalent rare earth ions in proximity to graphene and graphene nanoribbons is
calculated for achievable experimental conditions using a combination of finite
difference time domain simulations and direct computation of transition rates
between energy levels in rare earths. For Er$^{3+}$, we find that the 2PSE rate
is initially 8 orders lower than the single-photon spontaneous emission rate
but that, with enhancement, 2PSE can reach 2.5% of the overall decay. When
graphene nanoribbons are used, we also show that the emission of free-space
photon pairs from Er$^{3+}$ at 3 - 3.2 $\mu$m via 2PSE can be increased by
$\sim 400$. Our calculations show significantly less relative graphene-enhanced
2PSE than previous works, and we attribute this variation to differences in
emitter size and assumed graphene mobility. We also show that the internal
energy structure of the ion can have an impact on degree of 2PSE enhancement
achievable and find that divalent rare earths are more favorable.

<h3>Nonlocal transport signatures of Andreev bound states</h3>

<br>
In this PhD thesis, quantum devices based on molecular-beam epitaxy grown
InAs semiconductor with an in-situ grown epitaxial Al film were investigated.
Novel device geometries were realized that allow for the study of bound states
that emerge at low temperatures in semiconducting nanowires due to the presence
of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman effect, and superconducting proximity effect.
Experiments utilizing either gate-defined nanowires in two-dimensional
heterostructures or vapor-liquid-solid grown nanowires with a full-shell of Al
are presented. Devices and experimental methods were developed that allow for
tunneling spectroscopy at multiple locations of a nanowire. Results of nonlocal
conductance transport measurements of Andreev bound states are discussed. Due
to their extended wavefunction, bound states that are locally hybridized with a
quantum dot show characteristic signatures in tunneling spectroscopy at
neighboring measurement locations. If the distance between neighboring
tunneling measurement locations is larger than 0.8 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ no
signatures of extended bound states was observed.

<h3>Universal thermodynamic bounds on symmetry breaking in biochemical  systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Living systems are maintained out-of-equilibrium by external driving forces,
thus continuously dissipating energy. Non-equilibrium steady states are
characterized by emergent selection phenomena that break equilibrium symmetries
dictated solely by energetic properties. Here, we use the matrix-tree theorem
to derive universal thermodynamic bounds on these symmetry-breaking features in
biochemical systems. The presented bounds are independent of the kinetics and
hold for both closed and open reaction networks, whether they are uni-molecular
or catalytic. Our results can also be extended to the Master Equations in the
chemical space. Using our framework, we recover the thermodynamic constraints
in kinetic proofreading. Finally, we show that the contrast of
reaction-diffusion patterns can be bounded only by the non-equilibrium driving
force. The generality of these results paves the way to understanding
potentialities and limitations of non-equilibrium conditions in shaping
steady-state properties of biochemical systems.

<h3>Thermodynamic geometry of ideal quantum gases: a general framework and a  geometric picture of BEC-enhanced heat engines</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12076</a>
<br>
<i>Joshua Eglinton, Tuomas Pyharanta, Keiji Saito, Kay Brandner</i>
<br>
<br>
Thermodynamic geometry provides a physically transparent framework to
describe thermodynamic processes in meso- and micro-scale systems that are
driven by slow variations of external control parameters. Focusing on periodic
driving for thermal machines, we extend this framework to ideal quantum gases.
To this end, we show that the standard approach of equilibrium physics, where a
grand-canonical ensemble is used to model a canonical one by fixing the mean
particle number through the chemical potential, can be extended to the slow
driving regime in a thermodynamically consistent way. As a key application of
our theory, we use a Lindblad-type quantum master equation to work out a
dynamical model of a quantum many-body engine using a harmonically trapped Bose
gas. Our results provide a geometric picture of the BEC-induced power
enhancement that was previously predicted for this type of engine on the basis
of an endoreversible model [New J. Phys. 24, 025001 (2022)]. Using an earlier
derived universal trade-off relation between power and efficiency as a
benchmark, we further show that the Bose-gas engine can deliver significantly
more power at given efficiency than an equally large collection of single-body
engines. Our work paves the way for a more general thermodynamic framework that
makes it possible to systematically assess the impact of quantum many-body
effects on the performance of thermal machines.

<h3>Automated determination of grain boundary energy and  potential-dependence using the OpenKIM framework</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12081</a>

<i>Brendon Waters, Daniel S. Karls, Ilia Nikiforov, Ryan S. Elliott, Ellad B. Tadmor, Brandon Runnels</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a systematic methodology, built within the Open Knowledgebase of
Interatomic Models (OpenKIM) framework (https://openkim.org), for quantifying
properties of grain boundaries (GBs) for arbitrary interatomic potentials
(IPs), GB character, and lattice structure and species. The framework currently
generates results for symmetric tilt GBs in cubic materials, but can be readily
extended to other types of boundaries. In this paper, GB energy data are
presented that were generated automatically for Al, Ni, Cu, Fe, and Mo with 225
IPs; the system is installed on openkim.org and will continue to generate
results for all new IPs uploaded to OpenKIM. The results from the atomistic
calculations are compared to the lattice matching model, which is a
semi-analytic geometric model for approximating GB energy. It is determined
that the energy predicted by all IPs (that are stable for the given boundary
type) correlate closely with the energy from the model, up to a multiplicative
factor. It thus is concluded that the qualitative form of the GB energy versus
tilt angle is dominated more by geometry than the choice of IP, but that the IP
can strongly affect the energy level. The spread in GB energy predictions
across the ensemble of IPs in OpenKIM provides a measure of uncertainty for GB
energy predictions by classical IPs.

<h3>Delamination-assisted ultrafast wrinkle formation in a freestanding film</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12082</a>

<br>
<br>
The ability to synthesize and control two-dimensional (2D) crystals creates
numerous opportunities for studying emergent states of matter and their novel
functionalities. Freestanding films provide a particularly versatile platform
for materials engineering in 2D thanks to additional structural motifs not
found in films adhered to a flat substrate. A ubiquitous example is wrinkles,
yet little is known about how they can develop over as fast as a few
picoseconds due to a lack of experimental probes to visualize their dynamics in
real time at the nanoscopic scale. Here, we use ultrafast electron diffraction
to directly observe light-activated wrinkling formation in a freestanding
La$_{2/3}$Ca$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ film. Via a ``lock-in'' analysis of a single mode
of oscillation in the diffraction peak position, intensity, and width, we are
able to quantitatively reconstruct how wrinkles develop at the picosecond
timescale. Contrary to the common assumption of a fixed boundary condition for
freestanding films, we found that wrinkle development is associated with
ultrafast delamination at the contact point between the film boundary and the

work provide a generic protocol to quantify wrinkling dynamics in freestanding
films, it also highlights the importance of film-substrate interaction for
determining the properties of freestanding structures.

We report the use of suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (S-MBE) to grow
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ at a growth rate of ~1 ${\mu}$m/h with control of the
silicon doping concentration from 5x10$^{16}$ to 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$. In S-MBE,
pre-oxidized gallium in the form of a molecular beam that is 99.98\% Ga$_2$O,
i.e., gallium suboxide, is supplied. Directly supplying Ga2O to the growth
surface bypasses the rate-limiting first step of the two-step reaction
mechanism involved in the growth of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ by conventional MBE. As
a result, a growth rate of ~1 ${\mu}$m/h is readily achieved at a relatively
low growth temperature (T$_{sub}$ = 525 $^\circ$C), resulting in films with
high structural perfection and smooth surfaces (rms roughness of < 2 nm on ~1
${\mu}$m thick films). Silicon-containing oxide sources (SiO and SiO$_2$)
producing an SiO suboxide molecular beam are used to dope the
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ layers. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements on a
1 ${\mu}$m thick film with a mobile carrier concentration of 2.7x10$^{17}$
cm$^{-3}$ reveal a room-temperature mobility of 124 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$
that increases to 627 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at 76 K; the silicon dopants are
found to exhibit an activation energy of 27 meV. We also demonstrate working
MESFETs made from these silicon-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown by S-MBE
at growth rates of ~1 ${\mu}$m/h.

Strongly correlated electronic systems exhibit a wealth of unconventional
behavior stemming from strong electron-electron interactions. The
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure supports rich and varied
low-temperature transport characteristics including low-density
superconductivity, and electron pairing without superconductivity for which the
microscopic origins is still not understood. LAO/STO also exhibits inexplicable
signatures of electronic nematicity via nonlinear and anomalous Hall effects.
Nanoscale control over the conductivity of the LAO/STO interface enables
mesoscopic experiments that can probe these effects and address their
microscopic origins. Here we report a direct correlation between electron
pairing without superconductivity, anomalous Hall effect and electronic
nematicity in quasi-1D ballistic nanoscale LAO/STO Hall crosses. The
characteristic magnetic field at which the Hall coefficient changes directly
coincides with the depairing of non-superconducting pairs showing a strong
correlation between the two distinct phenomena. Angle-dependent Hall
measurements further reveal an onset of electronic nematicity that again
coincides with the electron pairing transition, unveiling a rotational symmetry
breaking due to the transition from paired to unpaired phases at the interface.
The results presented here highlights the influence of preformed electron pairs
on the transport properties of LAO/STO and provide evidence of the elusive
pairing ''glue'' that gives rise to electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$-based
systems.

Fast and accurate prediction of optimal crystal structure, topology, and
microstructures is important for accelerating the design and discovery of new
materials. A challenge lies in the exorbitantly large structural and
compositional space presented by the various elements and their combinations.
Speed, accuracy, and scalability are three desirables for any inverse design
tool to sample efficiently across such a vast space. While traditional global
optimization approaches (e.g., evolutionary algorithm, random sampling based)
have demonstrated the ability to predict new crystal structures that can be
used as super-hard materials, semiconductors, and photovoltaic materials to
name a few, it is highly desirable to develop approaches that converge faster
to the solution, have better solution quality, and are scalable to high
dimensionality. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are emerging as powerful
design tools capable of addressing these issues but primarily operate in
discrete action space. In this work, we introduce CASTING, which is an RL-based
scalable framework for crystal structure, topology, and potentially
microstructure prediction. CASTING employs an RL-based continuous search space
decision tree (MCTS -Monte Carlo Tree Search) algorithm with three important
modifications (i) a modified rewards scheme for improved search space
exploration (ii) a 'windowing' or 'funneling' scheme for improved exploitation
and (iii) adaptive sampling during playouts for efficient and scalable search.
Using a set of representative examples ranging from metals such as Ag to
covalent systems such as C and multicomponent systems (graphane, boron nitride,
and complex correlated oxides), we demonstrate the accuracy, the speed of
convergence, and the scalability of CASTING to discover new metastable crystal
structures and phases that meet the target objective.

<h3>Tailing Magnetoelectric properties of Cr2Ge2Te6 by Engineering  Covalently bonded Cr Self-intercalation: Ferromagnetic Half-metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional intrinsic ferromagnetic half-metal (HM) are important for the
spintronics. Manipulating the interlayer magnetic coupling of van der Waals
magnetic materials is an important method to control magnetoelectric
properties, which is especially useful for the spintronics. Here, based on
systematical research of CrGeTe3 (CGT) bilayer and multilayers with s of
self-intercalated (SI) Cr atom, we find that self-intercalation can enhance the
interlayer magnetic coupling. The super-exchange interaction still dominates
interlayer magnetic exchange interaction, which results in ferromagnetic
coupling between neighboring vdW layers. CGT bilayer keeps HM with FM order
after Cr self-intercalation, independent of self-intercalated Cr (CrSI) atoms'
concentration. Most importantly, self-intercalated CrGeTe3 (SI-CGT) bilayers
show ferromagnetic HM, independent of stacking orders. Moreover, SI-CGT
multilayers keep FM order, independent of films' thickness. However, SI-CGT
multilayers transform from HM into normal spin-polarized metal, as the states
at the Fermi-level increases. Moreover, magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of
SI-CGT-AA and SI-CGT-AB are -0.160 and -0.42 meV/.f.u., which are modulated by
CrSI atoms. The MAE of SI-CGT-AA and SI-CGT-AB are different, as the
hybridization interaction between Cr's d orbitals is different. SI-CGT
multilayers' magnetic easy axis (EA) switches from [001] of CGT to [100]
direction, independent of stacking orders. It origins that MAE mainly
contributed by hybridization between Te atoms' px and py, py and pz orbitals is
obvious weakened as CrSI is introduced. SI-CGT multilayers show good dynamical,
thermal, and magnetic stability at 300 and 500 K. These findings find a
promising way to manipulate interlayer exchange interaction and magnetoelectric
properties of CGT multilayers and other vdW magnets.

<br>
<br>
Tuning dimensionality in van der Waals materials with finite interlayer
coupling has introduced various electronic phase transitions by conventional
mechanical exfoliation. Particularly when the electronic order is tied to the
modulation of the interlayer coupling, such dimensional tunability has a strong
impact on its stability and properties, which has rarely been investigated
experimentally. Here, we demonstrate a dimensional crossover of charge order in
IrTe$_2$ from genuine two- to quasi-three-dimension using low-temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Employing atomically thin
IrTe$_2$ flakes ranging from monolayer to multilayer, we observe a gradual
phase transition of charge order and exponential decay of Coulomb gap with
increasing thickness. Moreover, we find a suppression of the density of states
emerging at an abrupt lateral interface between two- and three-dimension. These
findings are attributed to the interplay between the strongly coupled layers
and substrate-driven perturbation, which can provide a new insight into the
dimensional crossover of strongly coupled layered materials with hidden
electronic phases.

<h3>Thickness Dependent Itinerant Ferromagnetism in Ultrathin Ba-Doped  SrRuO3 films</h3>

<br>
<br>
The electronic and magnetic properties in ABO3 perovskite oxides are
extremely sensitive to lattice structure but also the dimensionality, such as
the thickness in thin film form. Here, we report the thickness-dependent
electro-magnetic properties of ultrathin epitaxially stabilized Sr1-xBaxRuO3 (x
= 0.08, 0.2) thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrate. The results reveal that the
Ba-doping (0.08 < x < 0.20) reduces RuO6 orthorhombic distortions existing in
SrRuO3 and induces a tetragonal distortion as evidenced by out-of-plane lattice
expansion. A metal-to-insulator transition, accompanied by a ferromagnetic to
non-magnetic transition occurs with reducing film thickness from 10 to 3
unit-cell (u.c.) for both x = 0.08 and 0.2, regardless of the doping level. The
results suggest that the effects of compositional vacancies and
surface/interface contributions introduced via dimensional confinement are more
dominant than A-site chemical disorder or structural distortion for the loss of
metallicity and ferromagnetism in ultra-thin epitaxial films.

<h3>In-situ scanning tunneling microscopy observation of thickness-dependent  air-sensitive layered materials and heterodevices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quasi-two-dimensional (Quasi-2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials can be
mechanically or chemically exfoliated down to monolayer because of their strong
intralayer bonding and the weak interlayer vdW interaction. Thanks to this
unique property, one can often find exotic thickness-dependent electronic
properties from these quasi-2D vdW materials, which can lead to band gap
opening, emerging superconductivity, or enhanced charge density waves with
decreasing thickness. Surface-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can
provide direct observation of structural and electronic characteristics of such
layered materials with atomic precision in real space. However, it is very
challenging to preserve the intrinsic surfaces of air-sensitive quasi-2D
materials between preparation and measurement. In addition, vdW 2D crystals
after exfoliation are extremely hard to explore with a typical STM setup due to
their small size (< 10 {\mu}m). Here, we present a straightforward method
compatible with any STM setup having optical access: (1) exfoliating and/or
stacking layered materials in a glove box, (2) transferring them to an
ultra-high vacuum STM chamber using a suitcase without exposure to air, and (3)
navigating surface to locate exfoliated vdW 2D flakes with different
thicknesses. We successfully demonstrated that the clean surfaces of the
air-sensitive Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ can be effectively protected from unwanted
oxidation during transfer. Furthermore, our method provides a simple but useful
way to access a specific tiny stack of layered materials without any ex-situ
fabrication processes for STM navigation. Our experimental improvement will
open up a new way to investigate air-sensitive layered vdW materials with
various thicknesses via surface-sensitive techniques including STM.

We investigate mechanically exfoliated thin 1T-TaS$_2$ with scanning
tunneling microscopy at room temperature. Sample preparation without air
exposure enables access to intrinsic charge-density-wave (CDW) phases of thin
1T-TaS$_2$. At room temperature, we can observe the expected nearly
commensurate CDW (NCCDW) phase on thin flakes similar to bulk 1T-TaS$_2$.
Further analysis reveals that the CDW domains in the NCCDW phase become smaller
and have more anisotropic shape with decreasing thickness in the range of 8-28
layers. Our findings demonstrate that the anisotropic CDW nature of thin
1T-TaS$_2$ would be crucial to understand its exotic CDW-related phenomena and
demand a systematic study on its correlation between the thickness-driven CDW
domain anisotropy and the intermediate CDW states in thin 1T-TaS$_2$.

Isostatic frames are mechanical networks that are simultaneously rigid and
free of self-stress states, and is a powerful concept in understanding phase
transitions in soft matter and designing of mechanical metamaterials. Here we
analyze substructures of isostatic frames, by generalizing ``Assur graphs'' to
the torus and examine them in physical systems. We show that the contact
network of marginally jammed packings approach torus Assur graphs in the
thermodynamic limit, and demostrate how Assur graphs offer a new design
principle for mechanical metamaterials in which motion and stress can propagate
in reconfigurable pathways, while rigidity of the entire structure is

The power of surface chemistry to create atomically precise nanoarchitectures
offers intriguing opportunities to advance the field of quantum technology.
Strategies for building artificial electronic lattices by individually
positioning atoms or molecules result in precisely tailored structures but lack
structural robustness. Here, taking the advantage of strong bonding of Br atoms
on noble metal surfaces, we report the production of stable quantum corrals by
dehalogenation of hexabromobenzene molecules on a preheated Au(111) surface.
The byproducts, Br adatoms, are confined within a new surface reconstruction
pattern and aggregate into nanopores with an average size of 3.7+-0.1 nm, which
create atomic orbital-like quantum resonance states inside each corral due to
the interference of scattered electron waves. Remarkably, the atomic orbitals
can be hybridized into molecular-like orbitals with distinct bonding and
anti-bonding states. Our study opens up an avenue to fabricate quantum
structures with high yield and superior robustness.

<h3>Opinion formation models with extreme switches and disorder: critical  behaviour and dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Kathakali Biswas, Parongama Sen</i>
<br>
<br>
In a three state kinetic exchange opinion formation model, the effect of
extreme switches was considered in a recent paper. In the present work, we
study the same model with disorder. Here disorder implies that negative
interactions may occur with a probability $p$. In absence of extreme switches,
the known critical point is at $p_c =1/4$ in the mean field model. With a
nonzero value of $q$ that denotes the probability of such switches, the
critical point is found to occur at $ p = \frac{1-q}{4}$ where the order
parameter vanishes with a universal value of the exponent $\beta =1/2$.
Stability analysis of initially ordered states near the phase boundary reveals
the exponential growth/decay of the order parameter in the ordered/disordered
phase with a timescale diverging with exponent $1$. The fully ordered state
also relaxes exponentially to its equilibrium value with a similar behaviour of
the associated timescale. Exactly at the critical points, the order parameter
shows a power law decay with time with exponent $1/2$. Although the critical
behaviour remains mean field like, the system behaves more like a two state
model as $q \to 1$. At $q=1$ the model behaves like a binary voter model with
random flipping occurring with probability $p$.

In purple bacteria, the fundamental charge-separation step that drives the
conversion of radiation energy into chemical energy proceeds along one branch -
the A branch - of a heterodimeric pigment-protein complex, the reaction center.
Here, we use first principles time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
with an optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functional to investigate the
electronic and excited-state structure of the primary six pigments in the
reaction center of \textit{Rhodobacter sphaeroides}. By explicitly including
amino-acid residues surrounding these six pigments in our TDDFT calculations,
we systematically study the effect of the protein environment on energy and
charge-transfer excitations. Our calculations show that a forward charge
transfer into the A branch is significantly lower in energy than the first
charge transfer into the B branch, in agreement with the unidirectional charge
transfer observed experimentally. We further show that inclusion of the protein
environment redshifts this excitation significantly, allowing for energy
transfer from the coupled $Q_x$ excitations. Through analysis of transition and
difference densities, we demonstrate that most of the $Q$-band excitations are
strongly delocalized over several pigments and that both their spatial
delocalization and charge-transfer character determine how strongly affected
they are by thermally-activated molecular vibrations. Our results suggest a
mechanism for charge-transfer in this bacterial reaction center and pave the
way for further first-principles investigations of the interplay between
delocalized excited states, vibronic coupling, and the role of the protein
environment of this and other complex light-harvesting systems.

<br>

The electrostatic screening properties of ionic fluids are of paramount
importance in countless physical processes. Yet, the behavior of ionic
conductors out of thermal equilibrium remains largely unexplored. We introduce
a theory of ionic screening under a stationary temperature profile which is
grounded on a gradient expansion of the local excess free energy. By borrowing
mathematical methods commonly used in the semiclassical approximation of
quantum particles, we find analytical solutions to the asymptotic decay of the
charge density which can be used to describe the non-equilibrium response of
the system to external charged perturbations. Notably, a transition between
monotonic and oscillatory screening regimes is observed as an effect of the
temperature variation which generalizes the Fisher-Widom line at thermal
equilibrium. Our findings pave the way to the rigorous treatment of
non-equilibrium steady states in ionic systems with potentially vast
applications to the study of energy materials and waste-heat-recovery
technologies.

<br>
Electron-phonon interaction and phonon frequencies of doped polar
semiconductors are sensitive to long-range Coulomb forces and can be strongly
affected by screening effects of free carriers, the latter changing
significantly when approaching the two-dimensional limit. We tackle this
problem within a linear-response dielectric-matrix formalism, where screening
effects can be properly taken into account by generalized effective charge
functions and the inverse scalar dielectric function, allowing for controlled
approximations in relevant limits. We propose complementary computational
methods to evaluate from first principles both effective charges --
encompassing all multipolar components beyond dynamical dipoles and quadrupoles
-- and the static dielectric function of doped two-dimensional semiconductors,
and provide analytical expressions for the long-range part of the dynamical
matrix and the electron-phonon interaction in the long-wavelength limit. As a
representative example, we apply our approach to study the impact of doping in
disproportionated graphene, showing that optical Fr\"ohlich and acoustic
piezoelectric couplings, as well as the slope of optical longitudinal modes,
are strongly reduced, with a potential impact on the electronic/intrinsic
scattering rates and related transport properties.

Understanding and controlling decoherence in open quantum systems is of
fundamental interest in science, while achieving long coherence times is
critical for quantum information processing. Although great progress was made
for individual, isolated systems, and electron spin resonance (ESR) of single
spins with nanoscale resolution has been demonstrated, the construction of
complex solid-state quantum devices requires ultimately controlling the
environment down to atomic scales, as potentially enabled by scanning probe
microscopy with its atomic and molecular characterization and manipulation
capabilities. Consequently, the recent implementation of ESR in scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) represents a milestone towards this goal and was
quickly followed by the demonstration of coherent oscillations, tunable dipolar
and exchange couplings and access to nuclear spins with real-space atomic
resolution. Atomic manipulation even fueled the ambition to realize first
artificial atomic-scale quantum devices. However, the current-based sensing
inherent to this method limits coherence times. Here, we demonstrate pump-probe
ESR atomic force microscopy detection of electron spin transitions between
non-equilibrium triplet states of individual pentacene molecules. Spectra of
these transitions exhibit sub-nanoelectronvolt energy resolution, allowing
local discrimination of molecules that only differ in their isotopic
configuration. Furthermore, the electron spins can be coherently manipulated
over tens of microseconds, likely not limited by the detection method but by
the molecular properties. Single-molecule ESR atomic force microscopy can be
combined with atomic manipulation and characterization, and thereby paves the
way for atomically well-defined quantum components with long coherence times
and local quantum-sensing experiments.

The study of quantum vortex dynamics in He II holds great promise to refine
quantum-fluid models. Bose-Einstein condensates, neutron stars or even
superconductors exhibit quantum vortices, whose interactions are a key element
of dissipation in these systems. These quantum objects have their velocity
circulation around their core quantized and, in He II, a core as thin as a
helium atom. They have been observed experimentally by indirect means, such as
second sound attenuation or electron bubble imprints on photo sensitive
material, and for the last twenty years, decorating cryogenic flows with
particles has proved to be a powerful method to study these vortices. However,
in these recent particle visualization observations, experimental stability,
initial condition, stationarity and reproducibility are elusive or fragmented
and 2d dynamical analysis are performed although most of the considered flows
are inherently 3d. Here we show that we are able to visualize these vortices in
the canonical and higher symmetry case of a stationary rotating superfluid
bucket. Using direct visualization, we quantitatively verify Feynman's rule
linking the resulting quantum vortex density to the imposed rotational speed.
Our statistically meaningful results demonstrate that decorated quantum
vortices behave as Feynman predicted. It follows that hydrogen flakes are good
tracers of quantum vortices for stationary cases in He II. The observed vortex
lattices are analogous to Abrikosov lattices found in superconductors and
Bose-Einstein condensates. Moreover, these lattices aligned with the rotation
axis can play the role of a well-defined and controlled initial condition for
dynamical cases. We make the most of this stable configuration by observing
collective wave mode propagation along quantum vortices and quantum vortex
interactions in rotating He II. These results provide a new experimental
baseline for models to evolve towards a better description of all
quantum-fluids.

A paramagnetic-ferromagnetic quantum phase transition is known to occur at
zero temperature in a two-dimensional coherently-coupled Bose mixture of dilute
ultracold atomic gases provided the interspecies interaction strength is large
enough. Here we study the fate of such a transition at finite temperature by
performing numerical simulations with the stochastic (projected)
Gross-Pitaevskii formalism, which includes both thermal and beyond mean-field
effects. By extracting the average magnetization, the magnetic fluctuations and
characteristic relaxation frequency (or, critical slowing down), we identify a
finite temperature critical line for the transition. We find that the critical
point shifts linearly with temperature and, in addition, the three quantities
used to probe the transition exhibit a temperature power-law scaling. The
scaling of the critical slowing down is found to be consistent with thermal
critical exponents and is very well approximated by the square of the spin
excitation gap at the zero-temperature.

<h3>Unexpected results of the phase transitions of four-state Potts model on  the square and the honeycomb lattices</h3>

<i>Jhao-Hong Peng, Fu-Jiun Jiang</i>
<br>
<br>
It is widely believed that the phase transition for the four-state
ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is of the pseudo-first order.
Specifically, it is expected that first-order phase transition behavior is
found on small lattices and that the true nature of second-order phase
transition only emerges with large system sizes. It is also intuitively
expected that for other geometries, the types of the associated phase
transitions should be identical to that of the square lattice. However, after
simulating more than 16 million spins for the four-state Pott model, we observe
that a feature of first-order phase transition persists on the square lattice.
Additionally, a characteristic of second-order phase transition already appears
on a small honeycomb lattice. Indications of a pseudo-first-order phase
transition were not found in our investigation. This suggests that a thorough
analytic calculation may be required to develop a better understanding of the
presented results.

Graphene nanoslit pore is used for nanofluidic devices like water
desalination, ion-selective channels, ionic transistors, sensing, molecular
sieving, blue energy harvesting, and protein sequencing. It is a strenuous task
to prepare nanofluidic devices because a small misalignment leads to a
significant alteration in various properties of the devices. Here we focus on
the rotational misalignment between two parallel graphene sheets. Using
molecular dynamics simulation, we probe the structure and dynamics of monolayer
water confined inside graphene nanochannels for a range of commensurate twist
angles. With SPC/E and TIP4P/2005 water model, our simulations reveal the
independence of equilibrium number density $(n \sim 13 nm^{-2})$ for SPC/E and
$(n \sim 11.5 nm^{-2})$ for TIP4P/2005) across twists. Based on the respective
densities of water models, the structure and dielectric constant are invariant
of twist angles. The confined water structure at this shows square ice ordering
for SPC/E water only. TIP4P/2005 shows ordering at the vicinity of a critical
density $(n \sim 12.5 nm^{-2})$. The average perpendicular dielectric constant
of the confined water remains anomalously low ($\sim 2$ for SPC/E and $\sim 6$
for TIP4P/2005) for studied twist angles. We find that the friction coefficient
of confined water molecules varies for small twist angles while becoming
independent for twists greater than $5.1^{o}$. Our results indicate that small
angular misalignment will not impair the dielectric properties of monolayer
water within graphene slit-pore but can significantly influence its dynamics.

We have performed magnetic torque and resistivity measurements on a
centrosymmetric skyrmion-host GdRu2Si2, in which the dominant magnetic
interaction leading to skyrmion formation is under debate. We observe both the
de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the forced
ferromagnetic phase. The angular dependence of the quantum oscillation
frequencies can be reproduced by the ab-initio calculation. The de Haas-van
Alphen oscillation is also observed in the double-Q phase with a different
frequency to that in the forced ferromagnetic phase, indicating a Fermi surface
reconstruction due to the coupling between localized spins and conduction
electrons. Based on these experimental findings, the magnetic interactions in
this system are discussed.

We study the localization and topological transitions of non-Hermitian SSH
models, where the non-Hermiticities are introduced by the complex quasiperiodic
hopping and the nonreciprocal hopping. The winding numbers of energy and the
Lyapunov exponents in analytic form are obtained to characterize the transition
points. Under the open boundary condition, two delocalization transitions are
found due to the competition between the boundary localization and the Anderson
localization. Although the second transition can be characterized by the
winding numbers, all the two delocalization transitions don't accompany the
topological transition. The second delocalization transition is dominated by
the quasiperiodic hopping due to the lack of boundary locations which is
similar to the periodic boundary case. Furthermore, the on-site non-Hermiticity
and non-Hermitian skin effect are detrimental to the boundary localization and
topological transitions. However, the non-Hermitian skin effect enhances the
Anderson localizations. The above analyses are verified by calculating the
energy gap and the inverse of the participation ratio numerically.

The local equilibrium thermodynamics is a basic assumption of macroscopic
descriptions of the out of equilibrium dynamics for Hamiltonian systems. We
numerically analyze the Hamiltonian Potts model in two dimensions to study the
violation of the assumption for phase coexistence in heat conduction. We
observe that the temperature of the interface between ordered and disordered
states deviates from the equilibrium transition temperature, indicating that
metastable states at equilibrium are stabilized by the influence of a heat
flux. We also find that the deviation is described by the formula proposed in
an extended framework of the thermodynamics.

<br>
We develop a pairing-field formalism for ab initio studies of
non-relativistic two-component fermions on a $(d\!+\!1)$-dimensional spacetime
lattice. More specifically, we focus on theories where the interaction between
the two components can be described by the exchange of a corresponding pairing
field. The introduction of a pairing field may indeed be convenient for studies
of, e.g., the finite-temperature phase structure and critical behavior of,
e.g., ultracold atomic Fermi gases. Moreover, such a formalism allows to
directly compute the momentum and frequency dependence of the pair propagator,
from which the pair-correlation function can be extracted. For a first
illustration of the application of our formalism, we compute the density
equation of state and the superfluid order parameter for a gas of unpolarized
fermions in $(0\!+\!1)$ dimensions by employing the complex Langevin approach
to surmount the sign problem.

Single-electron sources are an essential component of modern quantum
nanoelectronic devices. Owing to their high accuracy and stability, they have
been successfully employed for metrology applications, studying fundamental
matter interactions and more recently for electron quantum optics. They are
traditionally driven by state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators that are
capable of producing single-electron pulses in the sub-100 ps timescale. In
this work, we use an alternative approach for generating ultrashort electron
wavepackets. By combining several harmonics provided by a frequency comb, we
synthesise Lorentzian voltage pulses and then use them to generate electron
wavepackets. Through this technique, we report on the generation and detection
of an electron wavepacket with temporal duration of 27 ps generated on top of
the Fermi sea of a 2-dimensional electron gas - the shortest reported to date.
Electron pulses this short enable studies on elusive, ultrafast fundamental
quantum dynamics in nanoelectronic systems and pave the way to implement flying
electron qubits by means of Levitons.

Low dimensionality in CDW systems leads to anisotropic optical properties, in
both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. Here we perform polarized
two-color pump probe measurements on a quasi-1D material ZrTe$_3$, in order to
study the anisotropic transient optical response in the CDW state. Profound
in-plane anisotropy is observed with respect to polarization of probe photons.
Below $T_\mathrm{CDW}$ both the quasi-particle relaxation signal and amplitude
mode (AM) oscillation signal are much larger with $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr}$
nearly parallel to $a$ axis ($\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr} \parallel a$) than for
$\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr}$ parallel to $b$ axis ($\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr}
\parallel b$). This reveals that $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr} \parallel a$ signal is
much more sensitive to the variation of the CDW gap. Interestingly, the
lifetime of the AM oscillations observed with $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr} \parallel
b$ is longer than $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr} \parallel a$. Moreover, at high pump
fluence where the electronic order melts and the AM oscillations vanish for
$\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr} \parallel a$ , the AM oscillatory response still
persists for $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{pr} \parallel b$. We discuss possible origins
that lead to such unusual discrepancy between the two polarizations.

Fast feedback from cryogenic electrical characterization measurements is key
for the development of scalable quantum computing technology. At room
temperature, high-throughput device testing is accomplished with a probe-based
solution, where electrical probes are repeatedly positioned onto devices for
acquiring statistical data. In this work we present a probe station that can be
operated from room temperature down to below 2$\,$K. Its small size makes it
compatible with standard cryogenic measurement setups with a magnet. A large
variety of electronic devices can be tested. Here, we demonstrate the
performance of the prober by characterizing silicon fin field-effect
transistors as a host for quantum dot spin qubits. Such a tool can massively
accelerate the design-fabrication-measurement cycle and provide important
feedback for process optimization towards building scalable quantum circuits.

Superconducting circuits are an extremely versatile platform to realize
quantum information hardware, and, as was recently realized, to emulate
topological materials, such as three-dimensional Weyl semimetals or
two-dimensional Chern insulators. We here show how a simple arrangement of
capacitors and conventional superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS)
junctions can realize a nonlinear capacitive element with a surprising
property: it can be quasiperiodic with respect to the quantized Cooper-pair
charge. Integrating this element into a larger circuit opens the door towards
the engineering of an even broader class of systems. First, we use it to
simulate a protected Dirac material defined in the transport degrees of
freedom. The presence of the Dirac points leads to a suppression of the
classical part of the finite-frequency current noise. Second, we exploit the
quasiperiodicity to implement the Aubry-Andr\'e model, and thereby emulate
Anderson localization in charge space. Importantly, the realization by means of
transport degrees of freedom allows for a straightforward generalization to
arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, our setup implements a truly non-interacting
version of the model, in which the macroscopic quantum mechanics of the circuit
already incorporates microscopic interaction effects. We propose that
measurements of the quantum fluctuations of the charge can be used to directly
probe the localization effect. Finally, we present an outlook in which the
nonlinear capacitance is employed in a quantum circuit emulating a magic-angle
effect akin to twisted bilayer graphene.

<h3>Surface ferromagnetism in a chiral topological semimetal CoSi</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite the chiral topological semimetal CoSi is known as bulk diamagnetic,
it shows unusual surface ferromagnetism of debatable origin. The ferromagnetic
ordering has been attributed to the distorted bonds, the superlattice of
ordered vacancies, or even to topological surface textures due to the spin
polarization in the neighboring Fermi arcs. We experimentally compare
magnetization reversal curves for initially oxidized CoSi single crystals and
cleaved samples with a fresh, oxide-free surface. While the oxidized CoSi
samples do not show sizable ferromagnetism, the fresh CoSi surface gives a
strong ferromagnetic response, which is accompanied by the pronounced
modulation of the angle dependence of magnetization, as it can be expected for
easy and hard axes in a ferromagnet. In addition to the first order reversal
curves analysis, this observation allows us to distinguish between different
mechanisms of the ferromagnetic ordering in CoSi single crystals. We conclude
that the surface states-induced RKKY interaction between distorted bonds near
the sample surface is responsible for the strong ferromagnetic multi-domain
behavior for freshly cleaved samples.

The cross-over from quasi-two- to quasi-one-dimensional electron transport
subject to transverse electric fields and perpendicular magnetic fields are
studied in the diffusive to quasi-ballistic and zero-field to quantum Hall
regime. In-plane gates and Hall-bars have been fabricated from an
InGaAs/InAlAs/InAs quantum well hosting a 2DEG with carrier density of about
6.8$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, mobility of 1.8$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and an
effective mass of 0.042$m_e$ after illumination. Magnetotransport measurements
at temperatures down to 50 mK and fields up to 12 T yield a high effective
Land\'e-factor of |g$^*$| = 16, enabling the resolution of spin-split subbands
at magnetic field of 2.5 T. In the quantum Hall regime, electrostatic control
of an effective constriction width enables steering of the reflection and
transmission of edge channels, allowing a separation of fully spin-polarized
edge channels at filling factors ${\nu}$ = 1 und ${\nu}$ = 2. A change in the
orientation of a transverse in-plane electric field in the constriction shifts
the transition between Zeeman-split quantum Hall plateaus by ${\Delta}$B
$\approx$ 0.1 T and is consistent with an effective magnetic field of B$_{eff}$
$\approx$ 0.13 T by spin-dependent backscattering, indicating a change in the
spin-split density of states.

<h3>Quantum nonlinear planar Hall effect in bilayer graphene: an orbital  effect of a steady in-plane magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the quantum nonlinear planar Hall effect in bilayer graphene under a
steady in-plane magnetic field. When time-reversal symmetry is broken by the
magnetic field, a charge current occurs in the second-order response to an
external electric field, as a result of the Berry curvature dipole in momentum
space. We have shown that a nonlinear planar Hall effect originating from the
anomalous velocity is deduced by an orbital effect of an in-plane magnetic
field on electrons in bilayer graphene in the complete absence of spin-orbit
coupling. Taking into account the symmetry analysis, we derived the dominant
dependence of Berry curvature dipole moment on the magnetic field components.
Moreover, we illustrate how to control and modulate the Berry curvature dipole
with an external planar magnetic field, gate voltage, and Fermi energy.

A scheme is presented to calculate on a first-principles level
the spin-lattice coupling (SLC) parameters needed to perform
combined molecular-spin dynamics (MSD) simulations. By treating changes to
the spin configuration and atomic positions on the same level, closed
expressions for the atomic SLC parameters could be derived in a coherent way up
to any order. The properties of the SLC parameters are discussed considering
separately the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the SLC tensor. The changes
due to atomic displacements of the spin-spin exchange coupling (SSC) parameters
estimated using the SLC parameters are compared with the SSC parameters
calculated for an embedded cluster with the central atom displaced,
demonstrating good agreement of these results. Moreover, this allows to study
the impact of different SLC contributions, linear and quadratic with respect to
displacements, on the properties of the modified SSC parameters. In addition,
we represent an approach to calculate the site-diagonal SLC parameters
characterizing local magnetic anisotropy induced by a lattice distortion, which
is a counterpart of the approach based on magnetic torque used for the
investigations of magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) as well as for
calculations of the MCA constants. In particular, the dependence of the induced
magnetic torque on different types of atomic displacements is analyzed.

<br>
Recently, anomalies in the temperature dependences of the carrier density
and/or mobility derived from analysis of the magnetoresistivities using the
conventional two-band model have been used to unveil intriguing
temperature-induced Lifshitz transitions in various materials. For instance,
two temperature-driven Lifshitz transitions were inferred to exist in the Dirac
nodal-line semimetal ZrSiSe, based on two-band model analysis of the Hall
magnetoconductivities where the second band exhibits a change in the carrier
type from holes to electrons when the temperature decreases below T = 106 K and
a dip is observed in the mobility versus temperature curve at T = 80 K. Here,
we revisit the experiments and two-band model analysis on ZrSiSe. We show that
the anomalies in the second band may be spurious, because the first band
dominates the Hall magnetoconductivities at T > 80 K, making the carrier type
and mobility obtained for the second band from the two-band model analysis
unreliable. That is, care must be taken in interpreting these anomalies as
evidences for temperature-driven Lifshitz transitions. Our skepticism on the
existence of such phase transitions in ZrSiSe is further supported by the
validation of the Kohler's rule for magnetoresistances at temperatures below
180 K. This work showcases potential issues in interpreting anomalies in the
temperature dependence of the carrier density and mobility derived from the
analysis of magnetoconductivities or magnetoresistivities using the
conventional two-band model.

The synergy between free electrons and light has recently been leveraged to
reach an impressive degree of simultaneous spatial and spectral resolution,
enabling applications in microscopy and quantum optics. However, the required
combination of electron optics and light injection into the spectrally narrow
modes of arbitrary specimens remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate
microelectronvolt spectral resolution in the nanoscale mapping of photonic
modes with quality factors as high as 10$^4$. We rely on mode-matching of a
tightly focused laser beam to whispering gallery modes to achieve a 10$^8$-fold
increase in light-electron coupling efficiency. By adapting the shape and size
of free-space optical beams to address specific physical questions, our
approach allows us to interrogate any type of photonic structure with

The stability of molecular junctions under transport is of the utmost
importance for the field of molecular electronics. This question is often
addressed within the paradigm of current-induced heating of nuclear degrees of
freedom or current-induced forces acting upon the nuclei. At the same time, an
essential characteristic of the failure of a molecular electronic device is its
changing conductance -- typically from a finite value for the intact device to
zero for a device that lost its functionality. In this publication, we focus on
the current-induced changes in the molecular conductance, which are inherent to
molecular junctions at the limit of mechanical stability. We employ a
numerically exact framework based on the hierarchical equations of motion
approach, which treats both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom on an
equal footing and does not impose additional assumptions. Studying generic
model systems for molecular junctions with dissociative potentials for a wide
range of parameters spanning the adiabatic and the nonadiabatic regime, we find
that molecular junctions that exhibit a decrease in conductance upon
dissociation are more stable than junctions that are more conducting in their
dissociated state. This represents a new mechanism that stabilizes molecular
junctions under current. Moreover, we identify characteristic signatures in the
current of breaking junctions related to the interplay between changes in the
conductance and the nuclear configuration and show how these are related to
properties of the leads rather than characteristics of the molecule itself.

Crystal structure, thermodynamic properties, and adiabatic demagnetization
refrigeration (ADR) effect in the spin-7/2 triangular antiferromagnet
KBaGd(BO3)2 are reported. With the average nearest-neighbor exchange coupling
of 44 mK, this compound shows magnetic order below $T_N = 263$\,mK in zero
field. The ADR tests reach the temperature of $T_{min} = 122$ mK, more than
twice lower than $T_N$, along with the entropy storage capacity of 192
mJK$^{-1}$cm$^{-3}$ and the hold time of more than 8 hours in the PPMS setup,
both significantly improved compared to the spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ analog. We argue
that KBaGd(BO3)2 shows a balanced interplay of exchange and dipolar couplings
that together with structural randomness and geometrical frustration shift
$T_{min}$ to well below the ordering temperature $T_N$, therefore facilitating
the cooling.

Molecule- and particle-based simulations provide the tools to test, in
microscopic detail, the validity of classical nucleation theory. In this
endeavour, determining nucleation mechanisms and rates for phase separation
requires an appropriately defined reaction coordinate to describe the
transformation of an out-of-equilibrium parent phase, for which myriad options
are available to the simulator. In this article, we describe the application of
the variational approach to Markov processes (VAMP) to quantify the suitability
of reaction coordinates to study crystallisation from supersaturated colloid
suspensions. Our analysis indicates that collective variables (CVs) that
correlate with the number of particles in the condensed phase, the system
potential energy and approximate configurational entropy often feature as the
most appropriate order parameters to quantitatively describe the
crystallisation process. We apply time-lagged independent component analysis to
reduce high-dimensional reaction coordinates constructed from these CVs to
build Markov State Models (MSMs), which indicate that two barriers separate a
supersaturated fluid phase from crystals in the simulated environment. The MSMs
provide consistent estimates for crystal nucleation rates, regardless of the
dimensionality of the order parameter space adopted; however, the two-step
mechanism is only consistently evident from spectral clustering of the MSMs in
higher dimensions. As the method is general and easily transferable, the
variational approach we adopt could provide a useful framework to study
controls for crystal nucleation.

Highly excited Rydberg atoms are a powerful platform for quantum simulation
and information processing. Here, we propose atomic ring networks to study
chiral currents of Rydberg excitations. The currents are controlled by a phase
pattern imprinted via a Raman scheme and can persist even in the presence of
dephasing. Depending on the interplay between the Rabi coupling of Rydberg
states and the dipole-dipole atom interaction, the current shows markedly
different features. The excitations propagate with a velocity displaying a
characteristic peak in time, that is found to be a universal function of
interaction and number of atoms. We find that the time-averaged current in a
quench behaves similar to the ground-state current. This analysis paves the way
for the development of new methods to transport information in atomic networks.

SnSe is a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor exhibiting record setting
thermoelectric properties driven by anharmonic phonons and intrinsic lattice
instabilities. In this work, we use time-resolved multi-THz spectroscopy to
observe a non-thermal, ultrafast electronic phase change in SnSe driven by
above band gap photoexcitation. The THz photoconductivity is polaronic in
nature and exhibits bimodal sub-picosecond dynamics with both fast (sub-30 fs)
and slow (100-200 fs) components attributed to the injection of both free and
polaronic charge carriers, respectively. Both the sub-picosecond dynamics and
the conductivity spectra show a drastic change at a critical excitation fluence
of approx. 6 mJ/cm2. Above this fluence, the THz mobility is reduced and
polaron formation is suppressed indicative of a photo-induced phase change and
an accompanying increase in charge scattering. We discuss the origin of this
transition in light of several recent works reporting photo-induced structural
phase changes sensed by light and electron scattering techniques. This work
provides important insights into the electronic response of functional
materials driven far beyond thermal perturbation.

We have observed a fluctuation-driven reduction in the viscosity of bulk
$^3$He in the normal state near the superfluid transition. While fluctuations
are ubiquitous in two dimensional superconducting materials, in three
dimensions fluctuations are thought to be limited to a very narrow region near
the superfluid transition temperature, $T_c$, and thus uncommon. The
observation of the fluctuation precursor is particularly relevant for
measurements of transport to expose the topological nature of $^3$He under
strong confinement, where $T_c$ is reduced. The normalized pressure dependence
of the fluctuation contribution is found to be monotonic, and increases with
pressure.

For decades transition-metal oxides have generated a huge interest due to the
multitude of physical phenomena they exhibit. In this class of materials, the
rare-earth nickelates, $R$NiO$_3$, stand out for their rich phase diagram
stemming from complex couplings between the lattice, electronic and magnetic
degrees of freedom. Here, we present a first-principles study of the
low-temperature phase for two members of the $R$NiO$_3$ series, with $R=$ Pr,
Y. We employ density-functional theory with Hubbard corrections accounting not
only for the on-site localizing interactions among the Ni--$3d$ electrons
($U$), but also the inter-site hybridization effects between the
transition-metals and the ligands ($V$). All the \textit{U} and \textit{V}
parameters are calculated from first-principles using density-functional
perturbation theory, resulting in a fully \emph{ab initio} methodology. Our
simulations show that the inclusion of the inter-site interaction parameters
$V$ is necessary to simultaneously capture the features well-established by
experimental characterizations of the low-temperature state: insulating
character, antiferromagnetism and bond disproportionation. On the contrary, for
some magnetic orderings the inclusion of on-site interaction parameters $U$
alone completely suppresses the breathing distortion occurring in the
low-temperature phase and produces an erroneous electronic state with a
vanishing band gap. In addition -- only when both the \textit{U} and \textit{V}
are considered -- we predict a polar phase with a magnetization-dependent
electric polarization, supporting very recent experimental observations that
suggest a possible occurrence of type-II multiferroicity for these materials.
