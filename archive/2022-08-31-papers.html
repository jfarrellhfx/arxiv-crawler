<h3>Structural Dynamics of Polymer:Non-Fullerene Organic Solar Cell Blends:  A Neutron Spectroscopy Perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00106</a>
<br>
<i>Mohamed Zbiri, Peter A. Gilhooly-Finn, Peter Fouquet, Christian B. Nielsen, Anne A. Y. Guilbert</i>
<br>
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on ADA-type (acceptor-donor-acceptor)
non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit improved power conversion efficiency
(PCE) compared to the conventional fullerene-based analogues. The
optoelectronic properties of OSC active layer blends are correlated to their
underlying structural dynamics and therefore influence the device performance.
Using synergistically different neutron spectroscopy techniques, we studied the
dynamics of binary and ternary blends made of the NFAs O-IDTBR and O-IDFBR and
the regioregular donor polymer P3HT. Deuteration was considered for a contrast
variation purpose. In addition to shedding light on the miscibilty and alloying
characters of the blends, a main outcome of this work is the evidenced similar
dynamical response of the blend components. This finding is in contrast with
our previous neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics studies of the
fullerene-based blend P3HT:PCBM, where we highlighted distinct behaviors of
P3HT and PCBM in terms of the vitrification/frustration of P3HT and the
plasticization of PCBM by P3HT upon blending. Alike P3HT vitrification is not
presently observed. The absence or the weak vitrification evidenced here is in
line with recent reports and is likely related to the improved PCE exhibited by
the ADA-type NFA-based OSCs.

<h3>Cooperation and competition in the collective drive by motor proteins:  Mean active force, fluctuations, and self-load</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00266</a>
<br>
<i>Chitrak Karan, Debasish Chaudhuri</i>
<br>
We consider the dynamics of a bio-filament under the collective drive of
motor proteins. They are attached irreversibly to a substrate and undergo
stochastic attachment-detachment with the filament to produce a directed force
on it. We establish the dependence of the mean directed force and force
correlations on the parameters describing the individual motor proteins using
analytical theory and direct numerical simulations. The effective Langevin
description for the filament motion gives mean-squared displacement, asymptotic
diffusion constant, and mobility leading to an effective temperature. Finally,
we show how competition between motor protein extensions generates a self-load,
describable in terms of the effective temperature, affecting the filament
motion.

<h3>Theoretical description of the first-order phase transition of aluminum  from a superconducting to normal state by the current-density functional  theory for superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00298" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00298</a>
<br>
<i>Katsuhiko Higuchi, Masahiko Higuchi</i>
<br>
We show that the current-density functional theory for superconductors
(sc-CDFT) can describe the magnetic-field-induced first-order phase transition
of aluminum from a superconducting state to a normal state. This is
accomplished by introducing a model for the magnetic field dependence of the
attractive interaction between superconducting electrons. This model states
that the surface potential well produced by the penetrating magnetic field
leads to the magnetic field dependence of the attractive interaction.
Specifically, the electron density near the surface increases with the magnetic
field due to the surface potential well, which causes the reduction in the
attractive interaction due to the screening effect. We also develop the
calculation scheme to solve the gap equation of the sc-CDFT with taking into
account the magnetic field dependence of the attractive interaction. It is
shown that calculation results of the magnetic field dependence of the
superconducting gap are in good agreement with experimental results of the
first-order phase transition.

<h3>Defect self-propulsion in active nematic films with spatially-varying  activity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00333" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00333</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Rønning, M. Cristina Marchetti, Luiza Angheluta</i>
<br>
We study the dynamics of topological defects in active nematic films with
spatially-varying activity and consider two setups: i) a constant activity
gradient, and ii) a sharp jump in activity. A constant gradient of extensile
(contractile) activity endows the comet-like $+1/2$ defect with a finite
vorticity that drives the defect to align its nose in the direction of
decreasing (increasing) gradient. A constant gradient does not, however, affect
the known self-propulsion of the $+1/2$ defect and has no effect on the $-1/2$
that remains a non-motile particle. A sharp jump in activity acts like a wall
that traps the defects, affecting the translational and rotational motion of
both charges. The $+1/2$ defect slows down as it approaches the interface and
the net vorticity tends to reorient the defect polarization so that it becomes
perpendicular to the interface. The $-1/2$ defect acquires a self-propulsion
towards the activity interface, while the vorticity-induced active torque tends
to align the defect to a preferred orientation. This effective attraction of
the negative defects to the wall is consistent with the observation of an
accumulation of negative topological charge at both active/passive interfaces
and physical boundaries.

<h3>Active microrheology of colloidal suspensions of hard cuboids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00350" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00350</a>
<br>
<i>Effran Mirzad Rafael, Luca Tonti, Fabián A. García Daza, Alessandro Patti</i>
<br>
By performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the
microrheology of isotropic suspensions of hard-core colloidal cuboids. In
particular, we infer the local viscoelastic behaviour of these fluids by
studying the dynamics of a probe spherical particle that is incorporated in the
host phase and is dragged by an external force. This technique, known as active
microrheology, allows one to characterise the microscopic response of soft
materials upon application of a constant force, whose intensity spans here
three orders of magnitude. By tuning the geometry of cuboids from oblate to
prolate as well as the system density, we observe different responses that are
quantified by measuring the effective friction perceived by the probe particle.
The resulting friction coefficient exhibits a linear regime at forces that are
much weaker and larger than the thermal forces, whereas a non-linear,
force-thinning regime is observed at intermediate force intensities.

<h3>Tuning nucleation kinetics via nonequilibrium chemical reactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00542</a>
<br>
<i>Yongick Cho, William M. Jacobs</i>
<br>
Unlike fluids at thermal equilibrium, biomolecular mixtures in living systems
can sustain nonequilibrium steady states, in which active processes modify the
conformational states of the constituent molecules. Despite qualitative
similarities between liquid-liquid phase separation in these systems, the
extent to which the phase-separation kinetics differ remains unclear. Here we
show that inhomogeneous chemical reactions can alter the nucleation kinetics of
liquid-liquid phase separation in a manner that is consistent with classical
nucleation theory, but can only be rationalized by introducing a nonequilibrium
interfacial tension. We identify conditions under which nucleation can be
accelerated without changing the energetics or supersaturation, thus breaking
the correlation between fast nucleation and strong driving forces that is
typical of phase separation and self-assembly at thermal equilibrium.

<h3>Many-Body Superconductivity in Topological Flat Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00007</a>
<br>
<i>Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Aaron Chew, Kukka-Emilia Huhtinen, Päivi Törmä, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<br>
In a flat band superconductor, bosonic excitations can disperse while
unpaired electrons are immobile. To study this strongly interacting system, we
construct a family of multi-band Hubbard models with exact eta-pairing ground
states in all space groups. We analytically compute their many-body excitations
and find that the Cooper pair bound states and density excitations obey an
effective single-particle Hamiltonian written in terms of the non-interacting
wavefunctions. These bound states possess a unique zero-energy excitation whose
quadratic dispersion is determined by the minimal quantum metric. The rest of
the bound state spectrum is classified by topological quantum chemistry, which
we use to identify Cooper pairs with Weyl nodes, higher angular momentum
pairing, and fragile topology. We also add electron kinetic energy as a
perturbation to show that the strongest pairing occurs at half filling and not
at the highest density of states. This is similar in spirit to the
superconductivity observed in twisted bilayer graphene.

<h3>Where Is The Quantum Spin Nematic?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00010</a>
<br>
<i>Shengtao Jiang, Judit Romhányi, Steven R. White, M. E. Zhitomirsky, A. L. Chernyshev</i>
<br>
We use analytical and density-matrix renormalization group approaches to
study spin-nematic states in a paradigmatic $J_1$--$J_2$
ferro-antiferromagnetic square-lattice Heisenberg model. Rigorous analytical
and unequivocal numerical evidence is provided in favor of the $d$-wave nematic
state of spin-flip pairs, but in a significantly narrower region than
anticipated. We also conjecture a devil's staircase of the multi-pair
condensates arising from attraction of the spin-flip pairs, with a stronger
attraction near the zero-field phase boundary leading to a first-order collapse
of magnetization and no nematic state. The outlined scenario and phase diagram
should be common to other models.

<h3>Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from a  $\mathcal{C}_4$-symmetric Dirac semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00022" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00022</a>
<br>
<i>Zhenfei Wu, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<br>
We analyze the topological properties of the possible superconducting states
emerging from a Cd$_3$As$_2$-like, $\mathcal{C}_4$-symmetric Dirac semimetal,
with two four-fold degenerate Dirac points separated in the $k_z$ direction.
Unlike the simplest Weyl semimetal for which all pairing orders are
topologically obstructed and nodal, we show that the topological obstruction
for pairing in Dirac semimetals crucially only exists for certain pairing
symmetries. In particular, we focus on odd-parity $B_{1u}$ and $B_{2u}$ pairing
states, both of which can be induced by Ising ferromagnetic fluctuations. The
$B_{1u}$ and $B_{2u}$ pairing states inherit the topological obstruction from
the normal state, which dictates that these states necessarily hosts four BdG
Dirac point nodes protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole charge. By a Wannier
state analysis, we show that the topological obstruction in the superconducting
states is of higher-order nature. As a result, in a rod geometry with gapped
surfaces, arcs of higher-order Majorana zero modes exist in certain $k_z$
regions of the hinges between the BdG Dirac points. Unlike Fermi arcs in Weyl
semimetals, the higher-order Majorana arcs are stable against self-annihilation
due to an additional $\mathbb{Z}$-valued monopole charge of the BdG Dirac
points protected by $\mathcal{C}_4$ symmetry. We find that the same
$\mathbb{Z}$-valued charge is also carried by $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels,
where the BdG spectrum hosts bulk ``nodal cages", i.e., cages formed by nodal
lines, that are stable against symmetry preserving perturbations.

<h3>Topological Field Theories of Three-Dimensional Rotation Symmetric  Insulators: Coupling Curvature and Electromagnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00026</a>
<br>
<i>Julian May-Mann, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Xuchen Cao, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<br>
Quantized responses are important tools for understanding and characterizing
the universal features of topological phases of matter. In this work, we
consider a class of topological crystalline insulators in $3$D with $C_n$
lattice rotation symmetry along a fixed axis, in addition to either mirror
symmetry or particle-hole symmetry. These insulators can realize quantized
mixed geometry-charge responses. When the surface of these insulators is
gapped, disclinations on the surface carry a fractional charge that is half the
minimal amount that can occur in purely $2$D systems. Similarly, disclination
lines in the bulk carry a fractionally quantized electric polarization. These
effects, and other related phenomena, are captured by a $3$D topological
response term that couples the lattice curvature to the electromagnetic field
strength. Additionally, mirror symmetric insulators with this response can be
smoothly deformed into a higher-order octopole insulator with quantized corner
charges. We also construct a symmetry indicator form for the topological
invariant that describes the quantized response of the mirror symmetric
topological crystalline insulators, and discuss an unusual response
quantization in time-reversal breaking systems.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Pfaffian invariant identifies magnetic obstructed atomic insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00029" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00029</a>
<br>
<i>Isidora Araya Day, Anastasiia Varentcova, Daniel Varjas, Anton R. Akhmerov</i>
<br>
We derive a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological invariant that extends beyond symmetry
eigenvalues and Wilson loops and classifies two-dimensional insulators with a
$C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry. To formulate this invariant, we consider an
irreducible Brillouin zone and constrain the spectrum of the open Wilson lines
that compose its boundary. We fix the gauge ambiguity of the Wilson lines by
using the Pfaffian at high symmetry momenta. As a result, we distinguish the
four $C_4 \mathcal{T}$-protected atomic insulators, each of which is
adiabatically connected to a different atomic limit. We establish the
correspondence between the invariant and the obstructed phases by constructing
both the atomic limit Hamiltonians and a $C_4 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric model that
interpolates between them. The phase diagram shows that $C_4 \mathcal{T}$
insulators allow $\pm 1$ and $2$ changes of the invariant, where the latter is
overlooked by symmetry indicators.

<h3>Bose-Einstein condensation in honeycomb dimer magnets and $\rm Yb_2 \rm  Si_2 \rm O_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00032</a>
<br>
<i>Chunhan Feng, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Alexander Wietek</i>
<br>
An asymmetric Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) dome was observed in a recent
experiment on the quantum dimer magnet $\rm Yb_2Si_2O_7$, which is modeled by a
"breathing" honeycomb lattice Heisenberg model with possible anisotropies. We
report a remarkable agreement between key experimental features and predictions
from numerical simulations of the magnetic model. Both critical fields, as well
as critical temperatures of the BEC dome, can be accurately captured, as well
as the occurrence of two regimes inside the BEC phase. Furthermore, we
investigate the role of anisotropies in the exchange coupling and the
$g$-tensor. While we confirm a previous proposal that anisotropy can induce a
zero temperature phase transition at magnetic fields smaller than the fully
polarizing field strength, we find that this effect becomes negligible at
temperatures above the anisotropy scale. Instead, the two regimes inside the
BEC dome are found to be due to a non-linear magnetization behavior of the
isotropic breathing honeycomb Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Our analysis is
performed by combining the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method
with the finite-temperature techniques of minimally entangled typical thermal
states (METTS) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC).

<h3>Multiversality and unnecessary criticality in one dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00037</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishodh Prakash, Michele Fava, S.A. Parameswaran</i>
<br>
We present microscopic models of spin ladders which exhibit continuous
critical surfaces whose properties and existence, unusually, cannot be inferred
from those of the flanking phases. These models exhibit either `multiversality'
-- the presence of different universality classes over finite regions of a
critical surface separating two distinct phases -- or its close cousin,
`unnecessary criticality'-- the presence of a stable critical surface within a
single, possibly trivial, phase. We elucidate these properties using Abelian
bosonization and density-matrix renormalization-group simulations, and attempt
to distill the key ingredients required to generalize these considerations.
<br>

<h3>Driven-dissipative Rydberg blockade in optical lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00039" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00039</a>
<br>
<i>Javad Kazemi, Hendrik Weimer</i>
<br>
While dissipative Rydberg gases exhibit unique possibilities to tune
dissipation and interaction properties, very little is known about the quantum
many-body physics of such long-range interacting open quantum systems. We
theoretically analyze the steady state of a van der Waals interacting Rydberg
gas in an optical lattice based on a variational treatment that also includes
long-range correlations necessary to describe the physics of the Rydberg
blockade, i.e., the inhibition of neighboring Rydberg excitations by strong
interactions. In contrast to the ground state phase diagram, we find that the
steady state undergoes a single first order phase transition from a blockaded
Rydberg gas to a facilitation phase where the blockade is lifted. The first
order line terminates in a critical point when including sufficiently strong
dephasing, enabling a highly promising route to study dissipative criticality
in these systems. In some regimes, we also find good quantitative agreement
with effective short-range models despite the presence of the Rydberg blockade,
justifying the wide use of such phenomenological descriptions in the
literature.

<h3>Quantitative Microscale Thermometry in Droplets Loaded with Gold  Nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00041</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas Sixdenier, Guillaume Baffou, Christophe Tribet, Emmanuelle Marie</i>
<br>
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are increasingly used for their thermoplasmonic
properties, i.e. their ability to convert light into heat upon plasmon
resonance. However, measuring temperature gradients generated at the microscale
by assemblies of AuNPs remains challenging, especially when they are randomly
distributed in three dimensions. Here, we introduce a label-free thermometry
approach, combining optical wavefront microscopy and numerical simulations, to
infer the heating power dissipated by a three-dimensional model system
consisting in emulsion microdroplets loaded with AuNPs. This approach gives
access to the temperature reached in the core of droplets upon irradiation
without need of extrinsic calibration. These quantitative results are validated
qualitatively via the observation of the phase transition of a thermoresponsive
polymer added in the droplet as an in situ thermal probe. This versatile
thermometry approach is promising for non-invasive temperature measurements in
various three-dimensional microsystems involving AuNPs as colloidal heat
sources, such as several light-responsive drug delivery systems.

<h3>Probabilistic buckling of imperfect hemispherical shells containing a  distribution of defects</h3>

<br>
The buckling of spherical shells is plagued by a strong sensitivity to
imperfections. Traditionally, imperfect shells tend to be characterized
empirically by the knockdown factor, the ratio between the measured buckling
strength and the corresponding classic prediction for a perfect shell.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the knockdown factor of a shell
containing a single imperfection can be predicted when there is detailed a
priori knowledge of the defect geometry. Still, addressing the analogous
problem for a shell containing many defects remains an open question. Here, we
use finite element simulations, which we validate against precision
experiments, to investigate hemispherical shells containing a well-defined
distribution of imperfections. Our goal is to characterize the resulting
knockdown factor statistics. First, we study the buckling of shells containing
only two defects, uncovering nontrivial regimes of interactions that echo
existing findings for cylindrical shells. Then, we construct statistical
ensembles of imperfect shells, whose defect amplitudes are sampled from a
lognormal distribution. We find that a 3-parameter Weibull distribution is an
excellent description for the measured statistics of knockdown factors,
suggesting that shell buckling can be regarded as an extreme-value statistics
phenomenon.

<h3>Large Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetostriction in Thin Films of  CoV$_2$O$_4$</h3>

<br>
Spinel Cobalt Vanadate CoV$_2$O$_4$ has been grown on (001) SrTiO$_3$
substrates. Using torque magnetometry experiments, we find that the previously
observed temperature induced anisotropy change, where the easy axis changes
from the out of plane [001] direction to a biaxial anisotropy with planar <100>
easy axes, occurs in a gradual second-order structural phase transition. This
work characterizes this transition and the magnetic anisotropies in the (001),
(100), and (-110) rotation planes, and explores their field dependence up to
30~T. Below 80~K, hysteretic features appear around the hard axes, i.e., the
out-of-plane direction in (-110) and (010) rotations and the planar <110>
directions in (001) rotations. This is due to a Zeeman Energy that originates
from the lag of the magnetization with respect to the applied magnetic field as
the sample is rotated. The appearance of the hysteresis, which persist up to
very high fields, shows that the anisotropy at low temperature is rather
strong. Additionally, field dependent distortions to the symmetry of the torque
response in increasing applied fields shows that magnetostriction plays a large
role in determining the direction and magnitude of the anisotropy.

We report the isotropic plasma atomic layer etching (ALE) of aluminum nitride
using sequential exposures of SF$_6$ plasma and trimethylaluminum
(Al(CH$_3$)$_3$, TMA). ALE was observed at temperatures greater than 200
$^\circ$C, with a maximum etch rate of 1.9 \r{A}/cycle observed at 300
$^\circ$C as measured using ex-situ ellipsometry. After ALE, the etched surface
was found to contain a lower concentration of oxygen compared to the original
surface and exhibited a $\sim 35$% decrease in surface roughness. These
findings have relevance for applications of AlN in nonlinear photonics and wide
bandgap semiconductor devices.

<br>
A spontaneous ferromagnetic moment can be induced in Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ thin
films below a temperature $T\approx 16$~K by the introduction of Mn dopants. We
demonstrate that films grown via molecular beam epitaxy with the stoichiometry
Mn$_{0.14}$Bi$_{1.86}$Te$_{3}$ maintain the crystal structure of pure
Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. The van der Waals nature of inter-layer forces in the
Mn$_{0.14}$Bi$_{1.86}$Te$_{3}$ crystal causes lattice mismatch with the
underlayer to have a limited effect on the resulting crystal structure, as we
demonstrate by thin film growth on tetragonal MgF$_{2}$ and NiF$_{2}$ (110).
Magnetic heterostructures consisting of Mn$_{0.14}$Bi$_{1.86}$Te$_{3}$ grown on
thin film antiferromagnetic NiF$_{2}$ show magnetic behavior consistent with a
coexistence of two decoupled magnetic layers. Electronic transport measurements
in the Mn$_{0.14}$Bi$_{1.86}$Te$_{3}$ films exhibit the onset of the anomalous
Hall effect at low temperatures. An inverse correlation between the magnitude
of the anomalous Hall effect and the electron carrier density is observed in
the samples. This correlation demonstrates that as the Fermi level is lowered
and approaches the bulk band gap, the magnetic moment of the film increases,
suggesting that topological surface states play a role in the development of
ferromagnetism.

<h3>Magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetoelasticity in weak ferromagnetic  RuF$_4$ monolayer</h3>

<br>
<i>Na Wang, Jun Chen, Ning Ding, Huimin Zhang, Shuai Dong, Shan-Shan Wang</i>
<br>
Considerable research interest has been attracted to noncollinear magnetic
structures for their intriguing physics and promising applications. In this
work, based on relativistic density functional theory, we reveal the
interesting magnetic order and relevant properties in monolayer RuF$_4$, which
can be exfoliated from its bulk phase. Although the spins on Ru ions are almost
antiferromagnetically aligned between nearest-neighbors, weak ferromagnetism is
generated because of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as
well as the single-ion anisotropy. A prominent magneto-optical Kerr effect can
be observed for this antiferromagnet, similar to those of regular strong
ferromagnets. In addition, a uniaxial strain can induce a ferroelastic
switching together with the in-plane rotation of spin direction, giving rise to
a strong intrinsic magnetoelasticity. Our work not only suggests an alternative
direction for two-dimensional magnetic materials, but also provides hints to
future devices based on antiferromagnetic magnetoelastic or magneto-optical
materials.

<h3>Magnon dynamics in parity-time-symmetric dipolarly coupled waveguides  and magnonic crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00180" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00180</a>
<br>
<i>Xi-guang Wang, Dominik Schulz, Guang-hua Guo, Jamal Berakdar</i>
<br>
We consider the magnonic properties of two dipolarly coupled magnetic
stripes, both deposited on a normal conductive substrate with strong spin-orbit
coupling. A charge current in the substrate acts on the adjacent magnets with
spin-orbit torques, which result in magnonic damping or antidamping of the spin
waves, and hence a gain-loss coupling of the two magnetic stripes. The whole
setup is demonstrated to exhibit features typical for parity-time (PT)
symmetric systems. Phenomena are demonstrated that can be functionalized in
magnonic devices, including reconfigurable magnonic diodes and logic devices.
Alternative stripes designs and PT-symmetric, periodic, coupled magnonic
textures are studied. Analytical and full numerical analysis identify the
conditions for the appearance of exceptional points (EPs), where magnonic gain
and loss are balanced and evidence nonreciprocal magnon propagation and
enhanced magnon excitation around EPs. Furthermore, the dipolar coupling is
shown to bring in a wave vector-dependent PT-symmetric behavior. Proposing and
simulating a PT-symmetric magnonic crystal, we show how EPs and hence
associated phenomena can be steered to a particular wave vector in a gaped
spectrum via material design. The phenomena offer additional tools for
magnonic-based communication and computational devices.

<i>Yi-Fan Zhang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Trinanjan Datta, Meng Wang, Dao-Xin Yao, Kun Cao</i>
<br>
Kagome antiferromagnetic metal FeSn has become an attracting platform for the
exploration of novel electronic states, such as topological Dirac states and
the formation of flat bands by localized electrons. Apart from the electronic
properties, Dirac magnons and flat magnon bands have also been proposed by
applying simplified Heisenberg models to kagome magnetic systems.Inelastic
neutron scattering studies on FeSn found well defined magnon dispersions at low
energies,but magnons at high energies are strongly dampled, which can not be
explained by localized spin models. In this paper, we utilize both linear spin
wave theory and time-dependent density functional perturbation theory to
investigate spin fluctuations of FeSn. Through the comparison of calculated
spin wave spectra and Stoner continuum, we explicitly show that the damping of
magnons at high energies are due to the Landau damping, and the appearance of
high energy optical-magnon like branches at the M and K point are resulted by
relatively low Stoner excitation intensity at those regions.

<h3>Ultrahigh measured electrostrain in polycrystalline bulk piezoceramics:  Role of mechanically relaxed grains</h3>

<br>
<i>Gobinda Das Adhikary, Rajeev Ranjan</i>
<br>
Recently we found that when conventional bulk polycrystalline piezoceramics
discs (~ 10 mm diameter) are thinned down to thickness ~ 200 microns or below,
the measured unipolar electrostrain (UES) values increased phenomenally
(arXiv:2208.07134). Here we demonstrate that this anomalous phenomenon
correlates strongly with the decrease in the degree of mutual mechanical
clamping between the grains which in turn enables enhanced switching of the
ferroelastic domains.

We investigate the electronic structure and magnetic properties of a
$J_\text{eff} = 1/2$ iridate Ca$_4$IrO$_6$ and the implications of doping
electrons and holes using ab initio density functional theory. Our calculations
considering spin-orbit interaction reveal that although the Mott-insulating
parent compound transforms into a conductor upon doping, antiferromagnetism
sustains in the doped system, albeit with a grossly noncollinear arrangement of
the spins. We find a strong spin-orbit interaction and magneto-crystalline
anisotropy, causing frustration in the system, possibly leading to the highly
noncollinear arrangement of spins upon non-magnetic doping. Our results may be
important from the viewpoint of spintronics using iridates or other $5d$
materials.

We study the target search of interacting Brownian particles in a finite
domain, focusing on the effect of inter-particle interactions on the search
time. We derive the integral equation for the mean first-passage time and
acquire its solution as a series expansion in the orders of the Mayer function.
For dilute systems relevant to most target search problems, we analytically
obtain the leading order correction to the search time and prove a universal
relation given by the particle density and the second virial coefficient.
Finally, we validate our theoretical prediction by Langevin dynamics
simulations for the various types of the interaction potential.

<h3>Structural properties of TaAs Weyl semimetal thin films grown by  molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(001) substrates</h3>

<br>
Thin crystalline layers of TaAs Weyl semimetal (9 and 18 nm thick) are grown
by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(001) substrates. The (001) planes of the
tetragonal TaAs lattice are parallel to the GaAs(001) substrate, but the
corresponding in-plane crystallographic directions of the substrate and the
layer are rotated by 45{\deg}. In spite of a substantial lattice mismatch
(about 19%) between GaAs(001) substrate and TaAs epilayer no misfit
dislocations are observed at the GaAs(001)/TaAs(001) interface. Only stacking
fault defects in TaAs are detected with transmission electron microscopy.
Thorough X-ray diffraction measurements and analysis of the in-situ reflection
high energy electron diffraction images indicates that TaAs layers are fully
relaxed already at the initial deposition stage. Atomic force microscopy
imaging reveals the columnar structure of the layers, with lateral (parallel to
the layer surface) columns about 20 nm wide and 200 nm long. Both X-ray
diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements indicate that the
columns share the same orientation and crystalline structure.

<h3>Uniaxial strain, topological band singularities and pairing symmetry  changes in superconductors</h3>

<br>

<br>
Uniaxial strain affects pairing symmetry states in superconductors by
changing the lattice symmetry, and by altering Fermi surface topology. Here, we
present a systematic study of these effects within a one-band negative-U
Hubbard model for s, p and d-wave pairing states. We consider a general 2D
model that can be applied to superconductors under uniaxial strain, modelled
via hopping anisotropy, on a square lattice. The results presented here model
an in plane compression along the x-axis, which reduces the lattice symmetry
from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic crystal space group. The effects of
hopping anisotropy on the different types of gap pairings are explored. We show
that changes in Tc are tunable with hopping anisotropy and depend on the
orientation of the gap function in relation to the opening of the Fermi surface
during the Lifshitz transition. In comparing the model results to experimental
data for the case of Sr2RuO4 it is found that both the d + id and d + ig
pairings best describe the changes in Tc for the superconducting state in
regards to its response to small uniaxial strain.

<br>
Lithium borosilicate (LBS) glass is a prototypical lithium-ion conducting
oxide glasses available for an all-solid state buttery. Nevertheless, the
atomistic modeling of LBS glass using $ab$ $initio$ (AIMD) and classical
molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations have critical limitations due to
computational cost and inaccuracy in reproducing the glass microstructures,
respectively. To overcome these difficulties, a machine-learning potential
(MLP) was examined in this work for modeling LBS glasses using DeepMD. The
glass structures obtained by this MLP possessed fourhold-coordinated boron
($^4$B) confirmed well with the experimental data and abundance of
three-membered rings. The models were energetically more stable compared with
those constructed with a functional force-field even though both the models
included reasonable $^4$B. The results confirmed MLP to be superior to model
the boron-containing glasses and address the inherent shortcomings of the AIMD
and CMD. This study also discusses some limitations of MLP for modeling
glasses.

We performed ultrasonic and temperature measurements under pulsed magnetic
fields on CeIrIn$_5$ to investigate whether or not the origin of metamagnetic
transition and field-induced Lifshitz transition was described by the
anisotropic electronic ordering with crystal symmetry breaking. We observed
elastic anomalies with the negative magnetocaloric effects around the
field-induced Lifshitz transition and the metamagnetic transition. On the other
hand, the elastic anomalies appeared both in the transverse elastic constants
$(C_{11} - C_{12})/2$ and $C_{66}$ in CeIrIn$_5$ while $(C_{11} - C_{12})/2$
showed significant elastic anomaly at the crystal symmetry breaking fields in
CeRhIn$_5$. These results indicate that the anisotropic electronic ordering
with crystal symmetry breaking is absent in high-magnetic fields in
CeIrIn$_{5}$.

<br>
Half topological states of matter and two-dimensional (2D) magnetism have
gained much attention recently. In this paper, we propose a special topological
semimetal phase called a 2D half Chern-Weyl semimetal (HCWS), which is a 2D
magnetic Weyl semimetal bound to the half Chern insulator phase by symmetry,
and the two phases can be converted to each other by manipulating the
magnetization direction. We provide the symmetry conditions to realize this
state in 2D systems with multiple screw axes. Tight-binding models with
multiple basis and a predicted 2D material, monolayer TiTe, are shown as the
concrete examples for HCWSs. The TiTe monolayer was shown to have a high
ferremagnetic Curie temperature (~966 K) as well as a Coulomb
correlation-enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and further demonstrates the
effect of correlation-enhanced SOC on magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and
energy gap opening. Our work reveals a state with switchable and spin-resolved
half body charge currents as well as half boundary charge currents, and will
provide a platform for novel and high-performance topological spintronics
devices.

Raising the temperature of a material enhances the thermal motion of
particles. Such an increase in thermal energy commonly leads to the melting of
a solid into a fluid and eventually vaporises the liquid into a gaseous phase
of matter. Here, we study the finite-temperature physics of dipolar quantum
fluids and find surprising deviations from this general phenomenology. In
particular, we describe how heating a dipolar superfluid from near-zero
temperatures can induce a phase transition to a supersolid state with a broken
translational symmetry. The predicted effect agrees with experimental
measurements on ultracold dysprosium atoms, which opens the door for exploring
the unusual thermodynamics of dipolar quantum fluids.

<br>
A precise discussion of a single bond requires consideration of two-particle
wave function for the particles involved. Here we define and determine
rigorously the intrinsic covalency and connected characteristics on the
canonical example of \ch{H2} molecule. This is achieved by starting from
analytic form for the two--particle wave function for electrons forming the
bond, in which we single out the atomic contribution (\textit{atomicity}) in an
unequivocal manner. The presence the of atomicity and ionicity factors
complements the existing attributes of the bond. In this way, a gradual
evolution of the molecular state to its two-atomic correspondant is traced
systematically with increasing interatomic distance. In effect, a direct
relation to the onset of incipient Mott-Hubbard atomicity (\textit{Mottness})
to the intrinsic covalency and ionicity is established. This goal is achieved
by combining the single--particle wave function readjustment with a
simultaneous determination of two--particle states in the particle
(second--quantization) representation.

<h3>Discrete global symmetries and dynamics of emergent fermions</h3>

<br>
<i>Fan Yang, Fei Zhou</i>
<br>
Global symmetries that define the number of low energy degrees of freedom
have profound consequences on universal properties near topological quantum
critical points and in other gapless or nearly gapless states of emergent
fermions. We take a $Z_2$ global symmetry (such as the time-reversal one) as an
example to study its effect on thermodynamic and transport properties. Although
the density of thermal entropy of $Z_2$ symmetric systems is simply twice of
their counterparts without any global symmetries or $Z_1$ case, the temperature
dependence of thermal conductivity $\kappa$ is distinctly and drastically
different for different symmetries. In the $Z_2$ symmetric case, we have
$\kappa\propto T^{-(d-1)}$ in the quantum critical regime near weakly
interacting fixed points, while for systems with no global symmetries or $Z_1$
case, $\kappa\propto T^{-(d+3)}$ with $d$ the spatial dimension. Only near
strong coupling fixed points, both cases with or without $Z_2$ global
symmetries follow the single scaling function, $\kappa \propto T^{d-1}$. These
distinct scalings of thermal conductivity can also appear in other gapless
fermion systems, such as surface states and Majorana wires at
superconductor--topological-insulator--superconductor junctions that are
experimentally accessible.

<br>
<i>Carmine Ortix, Jeroen van den Brink</i>
<br>
Magnetoelectric crystals have the interesting property that they allow
electric fields to induce magnetic polarizations, and vice versa, magnetic
fields to generate ferroelectric polarizations. Having such a magnetoelectric
coupling usually requires complex types of magnetic textures, e.g., of
spiralling type. Here we establish a novel approach to generate a linear
magnetoelectric coupling in insulators with a conventional, ferromagnetic
ground state. We show that nanoscale curved geometries lead to a reorganization
of the magnetic texture that spontaneously breaks inversion symmetry and
thereby induces macroscopic magnetoelectric multipoles. Specifically, we prove
that structural deformation in the form of controlled ripples activate a
magnetoelectric monopole in the recently synthesised two-dimensional magnets.
We also demonstrate that in zig-zag shaped ferromagnetic wires in planar
architectures, a magnetic toroidal moment triggers a direct linear
magnetoelectric coupling.

<br>
<i>Antonio Picano, Francesco Grandi, Philipp Werner, Martin Eckstein</i>
<br>
We discuss a semiclassical approach to solve the quantum impurity model
within non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory for electron-lattice models.
The effect of electronic fluctuations on the phonon is kept beyond Ehrenfest
dynamics, leading to a stochastic phonon evolution with damping and noise terms
that are self-consistently determined by the electronic correlation functions
in the fluctuating phonon field. Together with a solution of the electronic
model based on a non-perturbative quantum Boltzmann equation, the approach can
be used to address the coupled dynamics of the electrons and the lattice during
photo-induced phase transitions. Results for the Anderson-Holstein model are
benchmarked against numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo data. We find good
agreement for the phonon distribution function at temperatures comparable to
the charge ordering temperature. The general formulation can be extended to
models with electron-electron interactions or multi-orbital systems.

We theoretically demonstrate that the vortex supercurrent can be reversed by
odd-frequency Cooper pairs accompanied by surface Andreev bound states. The
surface of a three-dimensional superconductor pierced by a flux quantum is
considered. We compare the vortex supercurrents near the surface of the
spin-singlet $s$-wave and spin-triplet $p_z$-wave superconductors using
quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, where the surface is perpendicular to the
$z$ direction. We demonstrate that the vortex supercurrent near the surface of
a $p_z$-wave superconductor is reversed compared to those far from the surface,
whereas that of an $s$-wave superconductor is not. The splitting of the
zero-energy states caused by the interference of the surface Andreev bound
states and Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon modes is demonstrated.

<br>
We derive holographic superconductivity from a Hamiltonian that describes
pairing of two-dimensional electrons near a ferromagnetic quantum-critical
point. At low energies the theory maps onto a four-dimensional gravity
description with Lifshitz spacetime and dynamic scaling exponent $z=3/2$. The
curved spacetime is due to powerlaw correlations of the critical normal state.
The Lifshitz anisotropy is caused by phase-space constraints near the Fermi
surface. The pairing instabilities obtained in Lifshitz space and from the
Eliashberg formalism are found to be identical. We also formulate the
holographic map for values of the dynamic scaling exponent $1<z<\infty$. Our
result provides an explicit realization of the holographic correspondence in
two dimensions.

Quantum vortices are often endowed with an effective inertial mass, due, for
example, to massive particles in their cores. Such "massive vortices" display
new phenomena beyond the standard picture of superfluid vortex dynamics, where
the mass is neglected. In this work, we demonstrate that massive vortices are
allowed to collide, as opposed to their massless counterparts. We propose a
scheme to generate controllable, repeatable, deterministic collisional events
in pairs of quantum vortices. We demonstrate two mass-driven fundamental
processes: (i) the annihilation of two counter-rotating vortices and (ii) the
merging of two co-rotating vortices, thus pointing out new mechanisms
supporting incompressible-to-compressible kinetic energy conversion, as well as
doubly-quantized vortices stabilization in flat superfluids.

Transcription Factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate gene expression. The
regulation mechanism is via the binding of a TF to a specific part of the gene
associated with it, the TF's target. The target of a specific TF corresponds to
a vanishingly small part of the entire DNA, where at the same time the search
must end in a matter of tens of seconds at most for its biological purpose to
be fulfilled - this makes the search a problem of high interest. Facilitated
Diffusion is a mechanism used in nature for a robust and efficient search
process. This mechanism combines 1D diffusion along the DNA and "excursions" of
diffusion in 3D that help the TF to quickly arrive at distant parts of the DNA.
In this paper we provide a derivation concerning this mechanism that links this
search process to fundamental concepts in probability theory (conditional
probability).

CO oxidation on Ru(0001) is a long-standing example of a reaction that, being
thermally forbidden in ultra-high vacuum, can be activated by femtosecond laser
pulses. In spite of its relevance, the precise dynamics of the photo-induced
oxidation process as well as the reasons behind the dominant role of the
competing CO photo-desorption remain unclear. Here we use ab initio molecular
dynamics with electronic friction that account for the highly excited and
non-equilibrated system created by the laser to investigate both reactions. Our
simulations successfully reproduce the main experimental findings: the
existence of photo-induced oxidation and desorption, the large desorption to
oxidation branching ratio, and the changes in the O K-edge X-ray absorption
spectra attributed to the initial stage of the oxidation process. Now, we are
able to monitor in detail the ultrafast CO desorption and CO oxidation
occurring in the highly-excited system and to disentangle what causes the
unexpected inertness to the otherwise energetically favored oxidation.

We propose a geometric theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, namely
geometric thermodynamics, using our recent developments of
differential-geometric aspects of entropy production rate in non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. By revisiting our recent results on geometrical aspects of
entropy production rate in stochastic thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck
equation, we introduce the geometric framework of non-equilibrium
thermodynamics in terms of information geometry and optimal transport theory.
We show that the proposed geometric framework is useful for obtaining several
non-equilibrium thermodynamic relations, such as thermodynamic trade-off
relations between the thermodynamic cost and the fluctuation of the observable,
optimal protocols for the minimum thermodynamic cost and the decomposition of
the entropy production rate for the non-equilibrium system. We clarify several
stochastic-thermodynamic links between information geometry and optimal
transport theory via excess entropy production rate based on a relation between
the gradient flow expression and information geometry in the space of
probability densities and a relation between the velocity field in optimal
transport and information geometry in the space of path probability densities.

We propose and demonstrate complete spin state readout of a two-electron
system in a double quantum dot probed by an electrometer. The protocol is based
on repetitive single shot measurements using Pauli spin blockade and our
ability to tune on fast timescales the detuning and the interdot tunnel
coupling between the GHz and sub-Hz regime. A sequence of three distinct
manipulations and measurements allows establishing if the spins are in S,
Tzero, Tplus or Tminus state. This work points at a procedure to reduce the
overhead for spin readout, an important challenge for scaling up spin qubit
platforms.

To seek the high-$T_c$ pairing mechanism, many scientists have focused on the
mysterious spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking above Tc, such as nematic
order at $q=0$ and smectic order at $q\ne0$. Such exotic correlation-driven
symmetry breaking in metals has become a central issue in condensed matter
physics. We demonstrate the emergence of the nematic and smectic orders due to
orbital polarization ($n_{xz}\ne n_{yz}$) and the symmetry breaking in the
correlated intersite hopping (= bond order $\delta t_{i,j}$) in Fe-based and
cuprate superconductors. In addition, we discuss exotic spontaneous loop
current orders driven by the pure imaginary $\delta t_{i,j}$. These interesting
``unconventional density-waves'' originate from the quantum interference
between different spin fluctuations that is described by the vertex correction
(VC) in the field theory. In the next stage, we discuss electron-correlation
driven superconductivity due to the fluctuations of unconventional
density-waves. For this purpose, we suggest the beyond-Migdal-Eliashberg gap
equation by including the VCs into the equation. In Fe-based superconductors,
high-$T_c$ $s$-wave superconductivity can be mediated by nematic and smectic
fluctuations because the pairing interaction is magnified by the VCs. We also
discuss the multipolar fluctuation pairing mechanism in heavy fermion systems,
owing to the cooperation between the strong spin-orbit interaction and the
strong electron correlation. To summarize, we suggest that the quantum
interference mechanism described by the VCs is the key ingredients to explain
not only various unconventional density-waves, but also exotic superconducting
states in many strongly correlated metals. We finally discuss some interesting
future issues with respect to the quantum interference mechanism.

The growth and characterization of Bismuth (Bi) substituted YIG (Bi-YIG,
Bi0.1Y2.9Fe5O12) thin films are reported. Pulsed laser deposited (PLD) films
with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 150 nm were grown on Gadolinium Gallium
Garnet substrates. Two substrate orientations of (100) and (111) were
considered. The enhanced distribution of Bi3+ ions at dodecahedral site along
(111) is observed to lead to an increment in lattice constant from 12.379
angstrom in (100) to 12.415 angstrom in (111) oriented films. Atomic force
microscopy images showed decreasing roughness with increasing film thickness.
Compared to (100) grown films, (111) oriented films showed an increase in
ferromagnetic resonance linewidth and consequent increase in Gilbert damping.
The lowest Gilbert damping values are found to be (1.06) * 10E-4 for (100) and
(2.30) * 10E-4 for (111) oriented films with thickness of 150 nm. The observed
values of extrinsic linewidth, effective magnetization, and anisotropic field
are related to thickness of the films and substrate orientation. In addition,
the in-plane angular variation established four-fold symmetry for the (100)
deposited films unlike the case of (111) deposited films. This study prescribes
growth conditions for PLD grown single-crystalline Bi-YIG films towards desired
high frequency and magneto-optical device applications.

<h3>Dissipation indicates memory formation in driven disordered systems</h3>

Disordered and amorphous materials often retain memories of perturbations
they have experienced since preparation. Studying such memories is a gateway to
understanding this challenging class of systems, yet it often requires the
ability to measure local structural changes in response to external drives.
Here we show that dissipation is a generic macroscopic indicator for the memory
of the largest perturbation. Through experiments in crumpled sheets under
cyclic drive, we show that dissipation transiently increases when first
surpassing the largest perturbation due to irreversible structural changes with
unique statistics. This is used to devise novel memory readout protocols based
on global observables only. The general applicability of this approach is
demonstrated by revealing a similar memory effect in a three-dimensional
amorphous solid.

<h3>Revised Tolmachev-Morel-Anderson pseudopotential for layered  conventional superconductors with nonlocal Coulomb interaction</h3>

We study the effects of static nonlocal Coulomb interactions in layered
conventional superconductors and show that they generically suppress
superconductivity and reduce the critical temperature. Although the nonlocal
Coulomb interaction leads to a significant structure in the superconducting gap
function, we find that most properties can be effectively described by means of
an appropriately revised local Coulomb pseudopotential $\tilde{\mu}_C^*$, which
is larger than the commonly adopted retarded Tolmachev-Morel-Anderson
pseudopotential $\mu^*_C$. To understand this, we analyze the Bethe-Salpeter
equation describing the screening of Coulomb interaction in the superconducting
state and obtain an expression for $\tilde{\mu}_C^*$, which is valid in the
presence of nonlocal Coulomb interactions. This analysis also reveals how the
structure of the nonlocal Coulomb interaction weakens the screening effects
from high-energy pair fluctuations and therefore yields larger values of the
pseudopotential. Our findings are especially important for layered conventional
superconductors with small Fermi energies and can be easily taken into account
ab initio studies.

<h3>Anderson localisation of emergent quasiparticles: Spinon and vison  interplay at finite temperature in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory in three  dimensions</h3>

Fractional statistics of quasiparticle excitations often plays an important
role in the detection and characterisation of topological systems. In this
paper, we investigate the case of a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge
theory, where the excitations take the form of bosonic spinon quasiparticle and
vison flux tubes, with mutual semionic statistics. We focus on an
experimentally relevant intermediate temperature regime, where sparse spinons
hop coherently on a dense quasistatic and stochastic vison background. The
effective Hamiltonian reduces to a random-sign bimodal tight-binding model,
where both the particles and the disorder are borne out of the same underlying
quantum spin liquid degrees of freedom, and the coupling between the two is
purely driven by the mutual fractional statistics. We study the localisation
properties and observe a mobility edge located close to the band edge, whose
transition belongs to the 3D Anderson model universality class. Spinons allowed
to propagate through the quasistatic vison background appear to display quantum
diffusive behaviour. When the visons are allowed to relax, in response to the
presence of spinons in equilibrium, we observe the formation of vison depletion
regions slave to the support of the spinon wavefunction. We discuss how this
behaviour can give rise to measurable effects in the relaxation, response and
transport properties of the system and how these may be used as signatures of
the mutual semionic statistics and as precursors of the quantum spin liquid
phase arising in the system at lower temperatures.
