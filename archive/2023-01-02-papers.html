<h3>Understanding the Role of Non-Fullerene Acceptors Crystallinity on the  Charge Transport Properties and Performance of Organic Solar Cells</h3>

The active layer crystallinity has long been associated with favourable
organic solar cells (OSCs) properties such as high mobility and Fill Factor. In
particular, this applies to acceptor materials such as fullerene-derivatives
and the most recent Non-Fullerene Acceptors (NFAs), which are now surpassing
19% of Power Conversion Efficiency. Despite these advantages are being commonly
attributed to their 3-dimensional crystal packing motif in the single crystal,
the bridge that links the acceptor crystal packing from single crystals to
solar cells has not clearly been shown yet. In this work, we investigate the
molecular organisation of seven NFAs (o-IDTBR, IDIC, ITIC, m-ITIC, 4TIC, 4TICO,
m-4TICO), following the evolution of their packing motif in single-crystals,
powder and thin films made with pure NFAs and donor:NFA blends. In general, we
observed a good correlation between the NFA single crystal packing and their
molecular arrangement in the bulk heterojunction. However, the NFA packing
motif is not directly affecting the device parameters but it provide an impact
on the material propensity to form highly crystalline domain in the blend.
Although that NFA crystallinity is required to obtain high mobility, the domain
purity is more important to limit the bimolecular recombination and to obtain
high efficiency organic solar cells.

Quantum many-body phases offer unique properties and emergent phenomena,
making them an active area of research. A promising approach for their
experimental realization in model systems is to adiabatically follow the ground
state of a quantum Hamiltonian from a product state of isolated particles to
one that is strongly-correlated. Such protocols are relevant also more broadly
in coherent quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing. Here we explore
one such protocol in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A fully
magnetized state is connected to a correlated zero-magnetization state (an
xy-ferromagnet) by a many-body spin rotation, realized by sweeping the detuning
and power of a microwave field. The efficiency is characterized by applying a
reverse sweep with a variable relative phase. We restore up to 50% of the
original magnetization independent of the relative phase, evidence for the
formation of correlations. The protocol is limited by the many-body gap of the
final state, which is inversely proportional to system size, and technical
noise. Our experimental and theoretical studies highlight the potential and
challenges for adiabatic preparation protocols to prepare many-body eigenstates
of spin Hamiltonians.

<h3>Bosonization of the interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h3>

<br>
We derive the bosonization of the interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) with open boundaries. We use the classical Euler-Lagrange equations of
motions of the bosonized theory to compute the density profile of the Majorana
edge mode and observe excellent agreement with numerical results, notably the
localization of the mode near the boundaries. Remarkably, we find that
repulsive or attractive interactions do not systematically localize or
delocalize the edge mode but their effects depend on the value of the
staggering parameter. We provide quantitative predictions of these effects on
the localization length of the edge mode.

<h3>Non-Equilibrium Spark Plasma Reactive Doping Enables Highly Adjustable  Metal to Insulator Transitions and Improved Mechanical Stability for VO2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Although vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits the most abrupt metal to insulator
transition (MIT) properties near room-temperature, the present regulation of
their MIT functionalities is insufficient owing to the high complexity and
susception associated with V4+. Herein, we demonstrate a spark plasma assisted
reactive sintering (SPARS) approach to simultaneously achieve in situ doping
and sintering of VO2 within largely short period (~10 minutes). This enables
high convenience and flexibility in regulating the electronic structure of VO2
via dopant elements covering Ti, W, Nb, Mo, Cr and Fe, leading to a wide
adjustment in their metal to insulator transition temperature (TMIT) and basic
resistivity. Furthermore, the mechanical strengths of the doped-VO2 were
meanwhile largely improved via the compositing effect of high melting-point
dopant oxide. The high adjustability in MIT properties and improved mechanical
properties further paves the way towards practical applications of VO2 in power
electronics, thermochromism and infrared camouflage.

<h3>Subharmonic fidelity revival in a driven PXP model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00020" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00020</a>
<br>
<i>HaRu K. Park, SungBin Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
The PXP model hosts a special set of nonergodic states, referred to as
quantum many-body scars. One of the consequences of quantum scarring is the
periodic revival of the wave function fidelity. It has been reported that
quantum fidelity revival occurs in the PXP model for certain product states,
and periodic driving of chemical potential can enhance the magnitude of quantum
revival, and can even change the frequencies of revival showing the subharmonic
response. Although the effect of the periodic driving in the PXP model has been
studied in the limit of certain perturbative regimes, the general mechanism of
such enhanced revival and frequency change has been barely studied. In this
work, we investigate how periodic driving in the PXP model can systematically
control the fidelity revival. Particularly, focusing on the product state so
called a Neel state, we analyze the condition of driving to enhance the
magnitude of revival or change the frequencies of revival. To clarify the
reason of such control, we consider the similarities between the PXP model and
the free spin-1/2 model in graph theoretical analysis, and show that the
quantum fidelity feature in the PXP model is well explained by the free
spin-1/2 model. In addition, under certain limit of the driving parameters,
analytic approach to explain the main features of the fidelity revival is also
performed. Our results give an insight of the scarring nature of the
periodically driven PXP model and pave the way to understand their
(sub-)harmonic responses and controls.

<h3>Anyon statistics through conductance measurements of time-domain  interferometry</h3>

<br>
We propose a method to extract the mutual exchange statistics of the anyonic
excitations of a general Abelian fractional quantum Hall state, by comparing
the tunneling characteristics of a quantum point contact in two different
experimental conditions. In the first, the tunneling current between two edges
at different chemical potentials is measured. In the second, one of these edges
is strongly diluted by an earlier point contact. We describe the case of the
dilute beam in terms of a time-domain interferometer between the anyons flowing
along the edge and quasiparticle-quasihole excitations created at the tunneling
quantum point contact. In both cases, temperature is kept large, such that the
measured current is given to linear response. Remarkably, our proposal does not
require the measurement of current correlations, and allows us to carefully
separate effects of the fractional charge and statistics from effects of intra-
and inter-edge interactions.

Three-dimensional (3D) electronic band structure is fundamental for
understanding a vast diversity of physical phenomena in solid-state systems,
including topological phases, interlayer interactions in van der Waals
materials, dimensionality-driven phase transitions, etc. Interpretation of
ARPES data in terms of 3D electron dispersions is commonly based on the
free-electron approximation for the photoemission final states. Our soft-X-ray
ARPES data on Ag metal reveals, however, that even at high excitation energies
the final states can be a way more complex, incorporating several Bloch waves
with different out-of-plane momenta. Such multiband final states manifest
themselves as a complex structure and excessive broadening of the spectral
peaks from 3D electron states. We analyse the origins of this phenomenon, and
trace it to other materials such as Si and GaN. Our findings are essential for
accurate determination of the 3D band structure over a wide range of materials
and excitation energies in the ARPES experiment.

Superconducting topological systems formed by a strong 3D topological
insulator (TI) in proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor (SC) have
been intensely studied as they may host Majorana zero modes. However, there are
limited experimental realizations of TI-SC systems in which robust
superconducting pairing is induced on the surface states of the TI and a
topological superconducting state is established. Here, we fabricate a novel
TI-SC system by depositing, via focused ion beam, tungsten (W) nanoscale
clusters on the surface of TI Bi$_{0.91}$Sb$_{0.09}$. We find that the
resulting heterostructure supports phase-slip lines that act as effective
Josephson junctions. We probe the response of the system to microwave
radiation. We find that for some ac frequencies, and powers, the resulting
Shapiro steps' structure of the voltage-current characteristic exhibits a
missing first step and an unexpectedly wide second Shapiro step. The
theoretical analysis of the measurements shows that the unusual Shapiro
response arises from the interplay between a static Josephson junction and a
dynamic one, and allows us to identify the conditions under which the missing
first step can be attributed to the topological nature of the Josephson
junctions formed by the phase-slip lines. Our results suggest a new approach to
induce superconductivity in a TI, a novel route to realizing highly-transparent
topological Josephson junctions, and show how the response of superconducting
systems to microwave radiation can be used to infer the dynamics of phase-slip
lines.

Two types of long range interactions, dipolar interaction and cavity-mediated
interaction lead to exotic quantum phases. Both interactions have been realized
and observed in optical lattice setups. Here, we study quantum phases of
dipolar bosons trapped in optical lattices and coupled to a high-finesse cavity
where both dipolar interaction and cavity-mediated interaction coexist. We
perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and find that the checkerboard solid
is enhanced and the checkerboard supersolid phase can exist in a wide range of
densities (e.g. $ 0.27\lesssim n\lesssim0.73 $). Our unbiased numerical results
suggest that both solid and supersolid phases can be achieved experimentally
with magnetic atoms coupled to a cavity.

<h3>Material vs. structure: Topological origins of band-gap truncation  resonances in periodic structures</h3>

While resonant modes do not exist within band gaps in infinite periodic
materials, they may appear as in-gap localized edge modes once the material is
truncated to form a finite periodic structure. Here, we provide an analysis
framework that reveals the topological origins of truncation resonances,
elucidating formally the conditions that influence their existence and
properties. Elastic beams with sinusoidal and step-wise property modulations
are considered as classical examples of periodic structures. Their non-trivial
topological characteristics stem from the consideration of a phason parameter
that produces spatial shifts of the property modulation while continuously
varying how the boundaries are truncated. In this context, non-trivial band
gaps are characterized by an integer topological invariant, the Chern number,
which is equal to the number of truncation resonances that traverse a band gap
as the phason is varied. We highlight the existence of multiple chiral edge
states that may be localized at opposite boundaries, and illustrate how these
can be independently tuned by modified boundary-specific phason parameters.
Furthermore, we show that the frequency location of a truncation resonance is
influenced by the modulation volume fraction, boundary conditions, and number
of cells comprising the finite structure, thus quantifying its robustness to
these factors. Non-topological in-gap resonances induced by a defect are also
demonstrated, showing that these can be coupled with topological modes when the
defect is located at an edge. Finally, experimental investigations on
bi-material phononic-crystal beams are conducted to support these findings. The
tunability of truncation resonances by material-property modulation may be
exploited in applications ranging from vibration attenuation and thermal
conductivity reduction to filtering and flow control by phononic subsurfaces.

<h3>Giant excitonic magneto-optical Faraday rotation in single semimagnetic  CdTe/Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te quantum ring</h3>

Magnetic tuning of the bound exciton states and corresponding giant Zeeman
splitting (GZS) between {\sigma}^{+} and {\sigma}^{-} excitonic transitions in
CdTe/Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te quantum ring has been investigated in the Faraday
configuration for various concentrations of Mn^{2+} ions at different
temperatures, using the variational technique in the effective mass
approximation. The sp-d exchange interaction between the localized magnetic
impurity ions and the delocalized charge carriers has been accounted via
mean-field theory with the inclusion of modified Brillouin function. The
enhancement of the GZS, and in turn, the effective Land\'e g-factor with the
application of an external magnetic field is strikingly manifested in type-I -
type-II transition in the band structure, which has been well explained by
computing the overlap integral between the electron and hole, and the in-plane
exciton radius. This highlights the extraordinary magneto-optical properties,
including the giant Faraday rotation and associated Verdet constant, which have
been calculated using a single oscillator model. The oscillator strength and
exciton lifetime have been estimated and are found to be larger than in the
bulk diluted magnetic semiconductors and quantum wells, reflecting stronger
confinement inside the quantum ring. The results show that the DMS-based
quantum ring exhibits more extensive Zeeman splitting and Faraday rotation
which are a few orders of magnitude larger than in the existing quantum systems
and magneto-optical materials.

<h3>Renormalization of Ising cage-net model and generalized foliation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00103</a>
<br>
<i>Zongyuan Wang, Xiuqi Ma, David T. Stephen, Michael Hermele, Xie Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
A large class of type-I fracton models, including the X-cube model, have been
found to be fixed points of the foliated renormalization group (RG). The system
size of such foliated models can be changed by adding or removing decoupled
layers of $2$D topological states and continuous deformation of the
Hamiltonian. In this paper, we study a closely related model -- the Ising
cage-net model -- and find that this model is not foliated in the same sense.
In fact, we point out certain unnatural restrictions in the foliated RG, and
find that removing these restrictions leads to a generalized foliated RG under
which the Ising cage-net model is a fixed point, and which includes the
original foliated RG as a special case. The Ising cage-net model thus gives a
prototypical example of the generalized foliated RG, and its system size can be
changed either by condensing / uncondensing bosonic planon excitations near a
2D plane or through a linear depth quantum circuit in the same plane. We show
that these two apparently different RG procedures are closely related, as they
lead to the same gapped boundary when implemented in part of a plane. Finally,
we briefly discuss the implications for foliated fracton phases, whose
universal properties will need to be reexamined in light of the generalized
foliated RG.

<h3>Diffusion within pores fully revealed by magnetic resonance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00116" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00116</a>
<br>
<i>Evren Özarslan, Cem Yolcu, Alfredo Ordinola, Deneb Boito, Tom Dela Haije, Mathias Højgaard Jensen, Magnus Herberthson</i>
<br>
<br>
Probing the transport of fluids within confined domains is important in many
areas including material science, catalysis, food science, and cell biology.
The diffusion propagator fully characterizes the diffusion process, which is
highly sensitive to the confining boundaries as well as the structure within
enclosed pores. While magnetic resonance has been used extensively to observe
various features of the diffusion process, its full characterization has been
elusive. Here, we address this challenge by employing a special sequence of
magnetic field gradient pulses for measuring the diffusion propagator, which
allows for `listening to the drum' and determining not only the pore's shape
but also diffusive dynamics within it.

<h3>Parameter-free analytic continuation for quantum many-body calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00129" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00129</a>
<br>
<i>Mancheon Han, Hyoung Joon Choi</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a reliable parameter-free analytic continuation method for quantum
many-body calculations. Our method is based on a kernel grid, a causal spline,
a regularization using the second-derivative roughness penalty, and the L-curve
criterion. We also develop the L-curve averaged deviation to estimate the
precision of our analytic continuation. To deal with statistically obtained
data more efficiently, we further develop a bootstrap-averaged analytic
continuation method. In the test using the exact imaginary-frequency Green's
function with added statistical error, our method produces the spectral
function that converges systematically to the exact one as the statistical
error decreases. As an application, we simulate the two-orbital Hubbard model
for various electron numbers with the dynamical-mean field theory in the
imaginary time and obtain the real-frequency self-energy with our analytic
continuation method, clearly identifying a non-Fermi liquid behavior as the
electron number approaches the half filling from the quarter filling. Our
analytic continuation can be used widely and it will facilitate drawing clear
conclusions from imaginary-time quantum many-body calculations.

<br>
The open-source python package diffpy.mpdf, part of the DiffPy suite for
diffraction and pair distribution function analysis, provides a user-friendly
approach for performing magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis.
The package builds on existing libraries in the DiffPy suite to allow users to
create models of magnetic structures and calculate corresponding
one-dimensional and three-dimensional mPDF patterns. diffpy.mpdf can be used to
perform fits to mPDF data either in isolation or in combination with atomic PDF
data for joint refinements of the atomic and magnetic structure. Examples are
given using MnO and MnTe as representative antiferromagnetic compounds and MnSb
as a representative ferromagnet.

<h3>Magnetic Pair Distribution Function Data Using Polarized Neutrons and ad  hoc Corrections</h3>

<i>Benjamin A. Frandsen, Raju Baral, Barry Winn, V. Ovidiu Garlea</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the first example of magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF)
data obtained through use of neutron polarization analysis. Using the
antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnTe as a test case, we present high-quality
mPDF data collected on the HYSPEC instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source
using longitudinal polarization analysis to isolate the magnetic scattering
cross section. Clean mPDF patterns are obtained for MnTe in both the
magnetically ordered state and the correlated paramagnet state, where only
short-range magnetic order is present. We also demonstrate significant
improvement in the quality of high-resolution mPDF data through application of
ad hoc corrections that require only minimal human input, minimizing potential
sources of error in the data processing procedure. We briefly discuss the
current limitations and future outlook of mPDF analysis using polarized
neutrons. Overall, this work provides a useful benchmark for mPDF analysis
using polarized neutrons and provides an encouraging picture of the potential
for routine collection of high-quality mPDF data.

<h3>An implementation of the density functional perturbation theory in the  PAW framework</h3>

<br>

Quantifying materials' dynamical responses to external electromagnetic fields
is central to understanding their physical properties. Here we present an
implementation of the density functional perturbation theory for the
computation of linear susceptibilities using the projector augmented-wave
method. The Sternheimer equations are solved self-consistently through a nested
iterative procedure to compute the first-order wavefunctions, from which the
linear susceptibilities are obtained. As a demonstration, we compute the spin
wave spectral functions of two magnetic metals. The computed magnon spectra for
half-metallic CrO$_2$ and a Heusler intermetallic Cu$_2$MnAl show gapless
Goldstone modes when spin rotation symmetry is preserved and display reasonable
agreement with available experimental data. The Landau damping is computed to
be small in CrO$_2$, but significant in Cu$_2$MnAl producing an asymmetric
Lorentzian spectral lineshape. The access to linear susceptibilities as well as
first-order wavefunctions offers a range of novel possibilities in quantitative
understanding of materials' electronic properties from \textit{ab initio}
methods.

<h3>Contrasting Analog and Digital Resistive Switching Memory  Characteristics in Solution-Processed Copper (I) Thiocyanate and Its Polymer  Electrolyte Based Memristive Devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00147</a>
<br>
<i>Rajesh Deb, Saumya R. Mohapatra, Manjula G. Nair, Ujjal Das</i>
<br>
<br>
Usually, resistive switching (RS) devices show digital RS memory (sharp SET
and RESET process), which is most suitable for digital data storage
applications. Some RS devices also manifest ideal memristive behavior or analog
memory characteristics (gradual change in resistance states). The analog RS
properties of memristive devices widen their application domain to a much
broader field of neuromorphic computing. The tunability of memristive devices
to digital or analog memory applications greatly depends upon the switching
medium. In this work, we report a comparative study on RS properties of two
kinds of memristive devices based upon copper (I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a
solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) made up of CuSCN as ionic moieties in
polyethylene oxide (PEO). The device (ITO/CuSCN/Cu), prepared by spin-coating
CuSCN layer between ITO and copper electrode, shows simultaneous analog and
digital RS characteristics. The RS property of the device is tunable by varying
the thickness of the CuSCN layer. The current-voltage characteristics reveal
that devices prepared at 3000 rpm (thicker) during the spin-coating show only
digital bipolar RS memory. In comparison, the devices deposited at 4000 rpm
(thinner) show both analog and digital RS memory. The conduction mechanism
responsible for RS behavior in CuSCN-based devices is Schottky emission
mediated charge trapping and de-trapping at the interfacial states.
Contrastingly, when the same CuSCN is used as the electrolyte in SPE film, the
device only shows bipolar digital non-volatile memory characteristics. The RS
behavior is due to the electrochemical metallization (ECM) mechanism. The ON
and OFF states are achieved by the formation and rupture of copper filaments
due to the redox reactions at the interface.

<h3>Kibble-Zurek scaling in one-dimensional localization transitions</h3>

In this work, we explore the driven dynamics of the one-dimensional ($1$D)
localization transitions. By linearly changing the strength of disorder
potential, we calculate the evolution of the localization length $\xi$ and the
inverse participation ratio (IPR) in a disordered Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) model,
and investigate the dependence of these quantities on the driving rate. At
first, we focus on the limit in the absence of the quasiperiodic potential. We
find that the driven dynamics from both ground state and excited state can be
described by the Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS). Then, the driven dynamics near the
critical point of the AA model is studied. Here, since both the disorder and
the quasiperiodic potential are relevant directions, the KZS should include
both scaling variables. Our present work not only extends our understanding of
the localization transitions but also generalize the application of the KZS.

<h3>Minimum in the pressure dependence of the interfacial free energy  between ice Ih and water</h3>

Despite the importance of ice nucleation, this process has been barely
explored at negative pressures. Here, we study homogeneous ice nucleation in
stretched water by means of Molecular Dynamics Seeding simulations using the
TIP4P/Ice model. We observe that the critical nucleus size, interfacial free
energy, free energy barrier, and nucleation rate barely change between isobars
from -2600 to 500 bar when they are represented as a function of supercooling.
This allows us to identify universal empirical expressions for homogeneous ice
nucleation in the pressure range from -2600 to 500 bar. We show that this
universal behavior arises from the pressure dependence of the interfacial free
energy which we compute by means of the mold integration technique finding a
shallow minimum around -2000 bar. Likewise, we show that the change in the
interfacial free energy with pressure is proportional to the excess entropy and
the slope of the melting line, exhibiting the latter a reentrant behavior also
at the same negative pressure. Finally, we estimate the excess energy and the
excess entropy of the ice Ih-water interface.

The design of new High Entropy Alloys that can achieve exceptional mechanical
properties is presently of great interest to the materials science community.
However, due to the difficulty of designing these alloys using traditional
methods, machine learning has recently emerged as an essential tool.
Particularly, the screening of candidate alloy compositions using surrogate
models has become a mainstay of materials design in recent years. Many of these
models use the atomic fractions of the alloying elements as inputs. However,
there are many possible representation schemes for encoding alloy compositions,
including both unstructured and structured variants. As the input features play
a critical role in determining surrogate model performance, we have
systematically compared these representation schemes on the basis of their
performance in single-task deep learning models and in transfer learning
scenarios. The results from these tests indicate that compared to the
unstructured and randomly ordered schemes, chemically meaningful arrangements
of elements within spatial representation schemes generally lead to better
models. However, we also observed that tree-based models using only the atomic
fractions as input were able to outperform these models in transfer learning.

<h3>Electrically Sign-Reversible Topological Hall Effect in a Top-Gated  Topological Insulator (Bi,Sb)2Te3 on a Ferrimagnetic Insulator Europium Iron  Garnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological Hall effect (THE), an electrical transport signature of systems
with chiral spin textures like skyrmions, has been observed recently in
topological insulator (TI)-based magnetic heterostructures. The strong
spin-orbit coupling and the broken spatial inversion symmetry in such
heterostructures could lead to a sizable interfacial Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya
interaction, favorable for skyrmion formation and pronounced THE. However, the
intriguing interplay between the topological surface state (TSS) and THE is yet
to be fully understood. In this work, we report an unprecedentedly large THE
signal (4.0 micro-ohm*cm at 2 K) with an electrically reversible sign in a
top-gated 4 nm TI (Bi0.3Sb0.7)2Te3 (BST) grown on a ferrimagnetic insulator
(FI) europium iron garnet (EuIG). Dependences of THE on temperature, external
magnetic field angle, and gate bias were investigated and are consistent with
the prediction of a skyrmion-driven THE, amenable to elucidate the origin of
THE that occurred in TI-based heterostructures. Moreover, a sign change in THE
was discovered as the Fermi level was tuned electrically from the upper
(electron-doped region) to the lower parts (hole-doped region) of the gapped
BST Dirac cone and vice versa. We show that the exploitation of the TSS
features has led to a sign-reversal of THE repeatedly in a TI/FI top-gate
stack. Ultimately, this discovery is anticipated to impact technological
applications in ultralow power skyrmion-based spintronics.

<h3>Walk ferroelectric liquid droplets with light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00219</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Marni, Giovanni Nava, Raouf Barboza, Tommaso Bellini, Liana Lucchetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on
a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of
moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet
diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid
crystal in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles
generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean
molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase droplets are either
attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of
the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam
results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the
substrate. We understand this behavior as due to the coupling between the
polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in
the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is
not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of
the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

<h3>Torus geometry eigenfunctions of an interacting multi-Landau level  Hamiltonian</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00240" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00240</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishek Anand, Songyang Pu, G J Sreejith</i>
<br>
<br>
A short-ranged, rotationally symmetric multi-Landau level model Hamiltonian
for strongly interacting electrons in a magnetic field was proposed in
Ref~[\onlinecite{Anand20}] with the key feature that it allows exact many-body
eigenfunctions on the disk not just for quasiholes but all charged and neutral
excitations of the entire Jain sequence filling fractions. We extend this to
geometries without full rotational symmetry, namely the torus and cylinder
geometries, and present their spectra. Exact diagonalization of the interaction
on the torus produces the low-energy spectra at filling fraction
$\nu=n/(2pn+1)$ that is identical, up to a topological $2pn+1$ fold
multiplicity, to that of the integer quantum Hall spectra at $\nu=n$, for the
incompressible state as well as all excitations. While the ansatz
eigenfunctions in the disk geometry cannot be generalized to closed geometries
such as torus or sphere, we show how to extend them to cylinder geometry.
Meanwhile, we show eigenfunctions for charged excitations at filling fractions
between $1/3$ and $2/5$ can be written down on the torus and the spherical
geometries.

<h3>What Promotes Smectic Order: Applying Mean Field Theory to the Ends</h3>

<br>
<i>David A. King, Randall D. Kamien</i>
<br>
<br>
Not every particle that forms a nematic liquid crystal makes a smectic. The
particle tip is critical for this behaviour. Ellipsoids do not make a smectic,
but sphero-cylinders do. Similarly, only those N-CB alkylcyanobiphenyls with
sufficiently long ($N\ge 8$ carbons) alkane tails form smectics. We understand
the role of the particle tip in the smectic transition by means of a simple
two-dimensional model. We model sphero-cylinders by "boubas" with rounded tips,
and ellipsoids by "kikis" with pointed tips. The N-CB molecules are modelled by
a small body with a polymer tail. We find that rounded tips and longer polymer
tails lead to a smectic at lower densities by making the space between layers
less accessible, destabilizing the nematic.

<h3>Strongly correlated physics in organic open-shell quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00282" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00282</a>
<br>
<i>G. Gandus, D. Passerone, R. Stadler, M. Luisier, A. Valli</i>
<br>
<br>
Strongly correlated physics arises due to electron-electron scattering within
partially-filled orbitals, and in this perspective, organic molecules in
open-shell configuration are good candidates to exhibit many-body effects. With
a focus on neutral organic radicals with a molecular orbital hosting a single
unpaired electron (SOMO) we investigate many-body effects on electron transport
in a single-molecule junction setup. Within a combination of density functional
theory and many-body techniques, we perform numerical simulations for an
effective model for which all the parameters, including the Coulomb tensor, are
derived ab-initio. We demonstrate that the SOMO resonance is prone towards
splitting, and identify a giant electronic scattering rate as the driving
many-body mechanism, akin to a Mott metal-to-insulator transition. The nature
of the splitting, and thus of the resulting gap, as well as the spatial
distribution of the SOMO and its coupling to the electrodes, have dramatic
effects on the transport properties of the junction. We argue that the
phenomenon and the underlying microscopic mechanism are general, and apply to a
wide family of open-shell molecular systems.

<h3>Local Einstein relation for fractals</h3>

<br>
<i>J. L. Iguain, L. Padilla</i>
<br>
<br>
We study single random walks and the electrical resistance for fractals
obtained as the limit of a sequence of periodic structures. In the long-scale
regime, power laws describe
both the mean-square displacement of a random walk as a function of time and
the electrical resistance as a function of length. We show that
the corresponding power-law exponents satisfy the Einstein relation. For
shorter scales, where these exponents depend on length, we find how the
Einstein relation can be generalized to hold locally. All these
findings were analytically derived and confirmed by numerical
simulations.

<h3>Bending Deformation Driven by Molecular Rotation</h3>

<br>
<i>Pedro A. Santos-Florez, Shinnosuke Hattori, Qiang Zhu</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, some molecular crystals have been found to be surprisingly flexible
by undergoing a large extent of elastic or plastic deformation upon various
mechanical loads. Despite the increasing experimental reports on mechanically
flexible crystals, this phenomenon has never been reproduced in numerical
simulation and thus there is no atomistic mechanism to explain its physical
origin. Using three recently reported naphthalene diimide derivatives as the
examples, we perform the first direct molecular dynamics simulation to model
their mechanical behaviors from brittle fracture to elastic/plastic deformation
upon mechanical bending. Our simulation reveals that molecular rotational
freedom is the key factor to determine the crystal's mechanical response.
Furthermore, we propose the use of rotation-dependent potential energy surface
to classify organic materials' mechanical response and screen new mechanically
flexible candidates in future.

<h3>Effect of Edge Roughness on resistance and switching voltage of Magnetic  Tunnel Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00318</a>
<br>
<i>Rachit R. Pandey, Sutapa Dutta, Heston A. Mendonca, Ashwin A. Tulapurkar</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the impact of edge roughness on the electrical transport
properties of magnetic tunnel junctions using non-equilibrium Greens function
formalism. We have modeled edge roughness as a stochastic variation in the
cross-sectional profile of magnetic tunnel junction characterized by the
stretched exponential decay of the correlation function. The stochastic
variation in the shape and size changes the transverse energy mode profile and
gives rise to the variations in the resistance and switching voltage of the
magnetic tunnel junction. We find that the variations are larger as the
magnetic tunnel junction size is scaled down due to the quantum confinement
effect. A model is proposed for the efficient calculation of edge roughness
effects by approximating the cross-sectional geometry to a circle with the same
cross-sectional area. Further improvement can be obtained by approximating the
cross-sectional area to an ellipse with an aspect ratio determined by the first
transverse eigenvalue corresponding to the 2D cross section. These results
would be useful for reliable design of the spin transfer torque-magnetic random
access memory (STT-MRAM) with ultra-small magnetic tunnel junctions.

<h3>Magic angle in thermal conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Yajuan Cheng, Zheyong Fan, Tao Zhang, Masahiro Nomura, Sebastian Volz, Guimei Zhu, Baowen Li, Shiyun Xiong</i>
<br>
<br>
In this Letter, we report a magic angle of 1.08$^\circ$ in the thermal
conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG). Within the supercell of a
moir\'{e} lattice, there exist sites with different staking modes between the
two graphene layers, which serve as scatterers for the phonons that reduce the
thermal conductivity of TBLG compared to that of untwisted bilayer graphene.
Our detailed study reveals that the thermal magic angle arises from the
competition between the weakened spatial dependence of vibrational amplitude
and stress on one hand, and the increased number of scattering sites on the
other hand. The rapid decrease of spatial mismatch for atomic vibrational
amplitudes and local stresses at small angles significantly weakens the
scattering strength of a single scatterer. In contrast, the reduced crystal
period with twist angle dramatically increases scatterer density. The
combination of the two effects eventually leads to the apparition of this
irregularity in heat conduction. Our work not only enriches the research of
twisted graphene, but also reveals the underlying physics of the thermal magic
angle, which should impact heat conduction in two-dimensional materials in
general.

<br>
<br>
Although the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in (001)
Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O/ZnO heterostructures has been discovered for about twenty
years, the origin of the 2DEG is still inconclusive. In the present letter, the
formation mechanisms of 2DEG near the interfaces of (001) Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O/ZnO
heterostructures were investigated via the first-principles calculations
method. It is found that the polarity discontinuity near the interface can
neither lead to the formation of 2DEG in devices with thick Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O
layers nor in devices with thin Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers. For the
heterostructure with thick Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers, the oxygen vacancies
near the interface introduce a defect band in the band gap, and the top of the
defect band overlaps with the bottom of the conduction band, leading to the
formation of the 2DEG near the interface of the device. For the heterostructure
with thin Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O layers, the absorption of hydrogen atoms, oxygen
atoms, or OH groups on the surface of Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_{x}$O film plays a key role
for the formation of 2DEG in the device. Our results manifest the sources of
2DEGs in Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O/ZnO heterostructures on the electronic structure
level.

Anisotropy of light-matter interactions in materials give remarkable
information about the phonons and their interactions with electrons. We report
the angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy of single-crystal of Bi2Se3 to
obtain the elements of Raman tensor for understanding the strength of
polarization along different crystallographic orientations. Intensity variation
in the polar plots corresponding to E_g^1 ~ 37 cm-1, A_1g^1 ~71 cm-1, E_g^2 ~
130 cm-1, and A_1g^2 ~ 173 cm-1 suggests the higher differential polarizability
along cross-plane (bc-plane). The polar patterns and the differences in
elements of the Raman tensor provides the evidence of the fundamental
electron-phonon and anisotropic light matter interactions in Bi2Se3.

The copper fluoride Cu$_2$F$_5$ is a compound with 2D-magnetic exchange
interactions between the Cu ions in the $S=1$ and $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spin-states.
Using ab-initio calculations, we predict that the existence of 5% vacancies in
the fluoride sublattice of Cu$_2$F$_5$ results in the drastic transformation of
the spin-state of all copper ions and the final spin-states are $S=\frac{1}{2}$
and $S=0$. Consequently, the anisotropy of magnetic interactions increases, and
the 1D linear chains of the Cu $d^9$, $S=\frac{1}{2}$ ions appear. We also
propose a microscopic mechanism of such exchange interaction transformation via
CuO$_6$ octahedra elongation.

We present a systematic investigation of the edge states of two-dimensional
{\alpha}-bismuthene ({\alpha}-Bi) structures self-assembled on HOPG substrates,
using scanning tunnelling microscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. The
measurements are carried out for 3ML, 5ML and 7ML thick Bi structures. Our
spectroscopy studies reveal clear features at the edges of the 5ML and 7ML
thick structures, and the positions of the edge states (ESs) coincide with the
topographical step edges. In contrast, in 3ML structures the ESs appear to be
absent and instead new states are sometimes observed, far from the
topographical edge. These states are associated with a moir\'e pattern and
result from strain-induced modulation of the topology. Our observations
demonstrate the impact on the edge states of coupling to adjacent structures.

We report the colloidal synthesis of 2D SnTe nanosheets through precursor
hot-injection in a nonpolar solvent. During the reaction, an important
intermediate - Sn-template - is formed which defines the confined growth of
SnTe. This "flake-like" structure gives the first evidence for the possible 2D
morphology formation prior to the anion precursor injection (TOP-Te).
Additionally, we explore the role of each ligand in the reaction process. Thus,
we explain the formation and morphology evolution of 2D SnTe nanostructures
from a mechanism perspective as well as the role of each ligand on the
molecular scale. The interplay of ligands provides the necessary conditions for
the realization of stable low-dimensional SnTe nanomaterials with tunable size

changes with increasing rotational frequencies, and decipher the stability

Some correlated materials display an insulator-to-metal transition as the
temperature is increased. In most cases this transition can also be induced
electrically, resulting in volatile resistive switching due to the formation of
a conducting filament. While this phenomenon has attracted much attention due
to potential applications, many fundamental questions remain unaddressed. One
of them is its characteristic lengths: what sets the size of these filaments,
and how does this impact resistive switching properties. Here we use a
combination of wide-field and scattering-type scanning near-field optical
microscopies to characterize filament formation in NdNiO3 and SmNiO3 thin
films. We find a clear trend: smaller filaments increase the current density,
yielding sharper switching and a larger resistive drop. With the aid of
numerical simulations, we discuss the parameters controlling the filament width
and, hence, the switching properties.

The combination of spin-orbit coupling driven effects and multiferroic
tunneling properties was explored experimentally in thin Pt/Co/BTO/LSMO
multilayers. The presence of a Pt heavy metal allows for the spin
current-induced magnetization precession of Co upon radio-frequency charge
current injection. The utilization of a BTO ferroelectric tunnel barrier
separating the Co and LSMO ferromagnetic electrodes gives rise to both
tunneling-magnetoresistance and electroresistance. Using the spin-orbit torque
ferromagnetic resonance, the maganetization dynamics of the Co/Pt bilayers was
studied at room temperature. Unexpectedly the magnetization dynamics study in
the same geometry performed at low temperature reveals the existence of both Co
and LSMO resonance peaks indicating efficient spin current generation both
using the spin Hall effect in Pt and spin pumping in LSMO that tunnel via the
BTO barrier.

<h3>Phase behaviour of coarse-grained fluids</h3>

Soft condensed matter structures often challenge us with complex many-body
phenomena governed by collective modes spanning wide spatial and temporal
domains. In order to successfully tackle such problems mesoscopic
coarse-grained (CG) statistical models are being developed, providing a
dramatic reduction in computational complexity. CG models provide an
intermediate step in the complex statistical framework of linking the
thermodynamics of condensed phases with the properties of their constituent
atoms and molecules. These allow us to offload part of the problem to the CG
model itself and reformulate the remainder in terms of reduced CG phase space.
However, such exchange of pawns to chess pieces, or ``Hamiltonian
renormalization'', is a radical step and the thermodynamics of the primary
atomic and CG models could be markedly different. Here, we present a
comprehensive study of the phase diagram including binodal and interfacial
properties of a novel soft CG model, which includes finite-range attraction and
supports liquid phases. Although the model is rooted in similar arguments to
the Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic pair potential, its phase behaviour is
qualitatively different from that of LJ and features several anomalies such as
an unusually broad liquid range, change in concavity of the liquid coexistence
branch with variation of the model parameters, volume contraction on fusion,
temperature of maximum density in the liquid phase and negative thermal
expansion in the solid phase. These results provide new insight into the
connection between simple potential models and complex emergent condensed
matter phenomena.

<h3>Short-range excitonic phenomena in low-density metals</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Excitonic effects in metals are commonly supposed to be weak, because the
Coulomb interaction is strongly screened. We investigate the low-density regime
of the homogeneous electron gas, where low-energy collective excitations and
ghost modes were anticipated. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we show
that both phenomena exist thanks to reduced screening at short distances. This
is not captured by common approximations used in ab initio BSE calculations,
but requires vertex corrections that take the fermionic nature of charges into
account. The electron-hole wavefunction of the low-energy modes shows strong
and very anisotropic electron-hole correlation, which speaks for an excitonic
character of these modes. The fact that short-range physics is at the origin of
these phenomena explains why, on the other hand, also the simple adiabatic
local density approximation to time-dependent density functional theory can
capture these effects.

In a recent work by Schrodi $\textit{et al.}$ [Phys. Rev. B. $\textbf{104}$,
L140506 (2021)], the authors find an unconventional superconducting state with
a sign-changing order parameter using the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, including
the first vertex correction. This unconventional solution arises despite using
an isotropic bare electron-phonon coupling in the Hamiltonian. We examine this
claim using hybrid quantum Monte Carlo for a single-band Holstein model with a
cuprate-like noninteracting band structure and identical parameters to Schrodi
$\textit{et al}$.. Our Monte Carlo results for these parameters suggest that
unconventional pairing correlations do not become dominant at any carrier
concentration we have checked. Instead, strong charge-density-wave correlations
persist at the lowest accessible temperatures for dilute and nearly half-filled
bands. Lastly, we present arguments for how vertex-corrected Migdal-Eliashberg
calculation schemes can lead to uncontrolled results in the presence of Fermi
surface nesting.

Novel two-dimensional (2D) atomically flat materials, such as graphene and

spectra. We propose to effectively engineer their interactions with cold atoms

collective quantum phases and phenomena. Dirac materials are susceptible to
manipulation and quantum engineering via changes in their electronic properties
by application of strain, doping with carriers, adjustment of their dielectric
environment, etc. Consequently the interaction of atoms with such materials,
namely the van der Waals / Casimir-Polder interaction, can be effectively
manipulated, leading to the potential observation of physical effects such as
Quantum Reflection off atomically thin materials and confined Bose-Einstein

Ferroelectric control of two-dimensional magnetism is promising in
fabricating electronic devices with high speed and low energy consumption. The
newly discovered layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ and their Sb
counterparts exhibit A-type antiferromagnetism with intriguing topological
properties. Here, we propose to obtain tunable magnetic multistates in their
thin films by ferroelectrically manipulating the interlayer magnetic couplings
(IMCs) based on the Heisenberg model and first-principles calculations. Our
strategy relies on that interfacing the thin films with appropriate
ferroelectric materials can switch on/off an interlayer hopping channel between
Mn-$e_g$ orbitals as the polarizations reversed, thus resulting in a switchable
interlayer antiferromagnetism-to-ferromagnetism transition. On the other hand,
the interface effect leads to asymmetric energy barrier heights for the two
polarization states. These properties allow us to build ferroelectrically
switchable triple and quadruple magnetic states with multiple Chern numbers in
thin films. Our study reveals that ferroelectrically switchable magnetic and
topological multistates in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ family can be obtained by rational
design for multifunctional electronic devices, which can also be applied to
other two-dimensional magnetic materials.

Grain boundary (GB) migration is widely believed to maintain a linear
relation between its displacement and time under a constant driving force. In
this study, we investigated the migration behaviors of a set of GBs in Ni by
applying the synthetic driving force and shear stress via atomistic
simulations. It was found that the displacements of some shear-coupling GBs do
not exhibit a linear or approximately linear relation with the time, as widely
assumed, but evidently exhibit an acceleration tendency. Moreover, the boundary
velocity significantly decreases when increasing the bicrystal size
perpendicular to the GB plane. These behaviors were verified to be independent
of the magnitude and type of driving force but closely related to the
temperature and revealed to be unique to shear-coupling GBs exhibiting a rise
in the kinetic energy component along the shear direction. Moreover, after many
attempts, we found that the acceleration in migration and size effect can be
largely alleviated by adopting one specific kind of boundary condition.
Nevertheless, the continuous rise of kinetic energy still exists and leads to
the true driving force for GB migration lower than the nominally applied value.
For that reason, a technique is proposed to extract the true driving force
based on a quantitative analysis of the work-energy relation in the bicrystal
system. Accordingly, the calculated true mobility shows that the recently
proposed mobility tensor may not be symmetric at relatively large driving
forces.

<h3>Performance of the r$^{2}$SCAN functional in transition metal oxides</h3>

We assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the recently developed
meta-generalized gradient approximation (metaGGA) functional, the restored
regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed (r$^2$SCAN), in
transition metal oxide (TMO) systems and compare its performance against SCAN.
Specifically, we benchmark the r$^2$SCAN-calculated oxidation enthalpies,
lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments, and band gaps of binary
3\textit{d} TMOs against the SCAN-calculated and experimental values.
Additionally, we evaluate the optimal Hubbard \emph{U} correction required for
each transition metal (TM) to improve the accuracy of the r$^2$SCAN functional,
based on experimental oxidation enthalpies, and verify the transferability of
the \emph{U} values by comparing against experimental properties on other
TM-containing oxides. Notably, including the \textit{U}-correction to r$^2$SCAN
increases the lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments and band gaps of
TMOs, apart from an improved description of the ground state electronic state
in narrow band gap TMOs. The r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} calculated
oxidation enthalpies follow the qualitative trends of SCAN and SCAN+\emph{U},
with r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} predicting marginally larger lattice
parameters, smaller magnetic moments, and lower band gaps compared to SCAN and
SCAN+\textit{U}, respectively. We observe that the overall computational time
(i.e., for all ionic+electronic steps) required for r$^2$SCAN(+\textit{U}) to
be lower than SCAN(+\textit{U}). Thus, the r$^2$SCAN(+\textit{U}) framework can
offer a reasonably accurate description of the ground state properties of TMOs
with better computational efficiency than SCAN(+\textit{U}).

Spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors are promising candidates for
topological superconductors. They have been proposed in various
heterostructures where a material with strong spin-orbit interaction is coupled
to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor by proximity effect. However,
topological superconductors existing in nature and driven purely by strong
electron correlations are yet to be studied. Here we propose a realization of
such a system in a class of Kondo lattice materials in the absence of
spin-orbit coupling and proximity effect. Therein, the odd-parity Kondo
hybridization mediates ferromagnetic spin-spin coupling and leads to
spin-triplet resonant-valence-bond ($t$-RVB) pairing between local moments.
Spin-triplet $p\pm i p^\prime$-wave topological superconductivity is reached
when Kondo effect co-exists with $t$-RVB. We identify the topological nature by
the non-trivial topological invariant and the Majorana fermions at edges. Our
results offer a comprehensive understanding of experimental observations on
UTe$_2$, a U-based ferromagnetic heavy-electron superconductor.

Controlled Aharonov-Bohm caging of wave train is reported in a quasi-one
dimensional version of Lieb geometry with next nearest neighbor hopping
integral within the tight-binding framework. This longer wavelength fluctuation
is considered by incorporating periodic, quasi-periodic or fractal kind of
geometry inside the skeleton of the original network. This invites exotic
eigenspectrum displaying a distribution of flat band states. Also a subtle
modulation of external magnetic flux leads to a comprehensive control over
those non-resonant modes. Real space renormalization group method provides us
an exact analytical prescription for the study of such tunable imprisonment of
excitation. The non-trivial tunability of external agent is important as well
as challenging in the context of experimental perspective.

<h3>Spin Hall and Edelstein Effects in pseudospin-1 systems: significant  contribution of vertex corrections</h3>

<br>
<br>
Edelstein and spin Hall effect response functions for a two-dimensional (2D)
system of pseudospin-1 particles is investigated. These two response functions
denoted by $ \sigma_{SH} $ and $ \sigma_{EE} $ have been analyzed in a
pseudospin-1 particle system in the presence of the Rashba-type spin-orbit
interaction using the Kubo-Streda technique and vertex corrections with
non-magnetic impurities. Then, for a given range of the Rashba coupling,
response functions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and Edelstein effect (EE) have
been estimated at various energy gaps and Fermi energies. Results indicate that
in this type of the two-dimensional materials, SHE and EE are essentially
induced by the vertex corrections and without considering these corrections the
amount of these effects are really negligible. It has also been realized that
SHE and EE conductivities can be modulated by the Rashba coupling strength at
low and intermediate level of this spin-orbit type interaction.

<h3>Sample-to-sample fluctuations of transport coefficients in the totally  asymmetric simple exclusion process with quenched disorders</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes on quenched
random energy landscapes. We show that the current and the diffusion
coefficient differ from those for homogeneous environments. Using the
mean-field approximation, we analytically obtain the site density when the
particle density is low or high. As a result, the current and the diffusion
coefficient are described by the dilute limit of particles or holes,
respectively. However, in the intermediate regime, due to the many-body effect,
the current and the diffusion coefficient differ from those for single-particle
dynamics. The current is almost constant and becomes the maximal value in the
intermediate regime. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient decreases with the
particle density in the intermediate regime. We obtain analytical expressions
for the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient based on the renewal
theory. The deepest energy depth plays a central role in determining the
maximal current and the diffusion coefficient. As a result, the maximal current
and the diffusion coefficient depend crucially on the disorder, i.e.,
non-self-averaging. Based on the extreme value theory, we find that
sample-to-sample fluctuations of the maximal current and diffusion coefficient
are characterized by the Weibull distribution. We show that the disorder
averages of the maximal current and the diffusion coefficient converge to zero
as the system size is increased and quantify the degree of the
non-self-averaging effect for the maximal current and the diffusion
coefficient.

<br>
Heterostructures based on two dimensional (2D) materials offer the
possibility to achieve synergistic functionalities which otherwise remain
secluded by their individual counterparts. Herein ferroelectric polarization
switching in alpha-In2Se3 has been utilized to engineer multilevel non-volatile
conduction states in partially overlapping alpha-In2Se3-MoS2 based
ferroelectric semiconducting field effect device. In particular, we demonstrate
how the intercoupled ferroelectric nature of alpha-In2Se3 allows to
non-volatilely switch between n-i and n-i-n type junction configurations based
on a novel edge state actuation mechanism, paving the way for sub-nanometric
scale non-volatile device miniaturization. Furthermore the induced asymmetric
polarization enables enhanced photogenerated carriers separation resulting in
extremely high photoresponse of 1275 AW-1 in the visible range and strong
non-volatile modulation of the bright A- and B- excitonic emission channels in
the overlaying MoS2 monolayer. Our results show significant potential to
harness the switchable polarization in partially overlapping alpha-In2Se3-MoS2
based FeFETs to engineer multimodal non-volatile nanoscale electronic and
optoelectronic devices.

Nuclear spins in quantum dots are promising candidates for fast and scalable
quantum memory. By utilizing the hyperfine interaction between the central
electron and its surrounding nuclei, quantum information can be transferred to
the collective state of the nuclei and be stored for a long time. However,
nuclear spin fluctuations in a partially polarized nuclear bath deteriorate the
quantum memory fidelity. Here we introduce a noise-resistant protocol to
realize fast and high-fidelity quantum memory through Hamiltonian engineering.
With analytics and numerics, we show that high-fidelity quantum state transfer
between the electron and the nuclear spins is achievable at relatively low
nuclear polarizations, due to the strong suppression of nuclear spin noises.
For a realistic quantum dot with $10^4$ nuclear spins, a fidelity surpassing
80% is possible at a polarization as low as 30%. Our approach reduces the
demand for high nuclear polarization, making experimentally realizing quantum
memory in quantum dots more feasible.

<h3>Tailoring the escape rate of a Brownian particle by combining a vortex  flow with a magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<i>Iman Abdoli, Hartmut Löwen, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
The probability per unit time for a thermally activated Brownian particle to
escape over a potential well is in general well-described by Kramers theory.
Kramers showed that the escape time decreases exponentially with increasing
barrier height. The dynamics slow down when the particle is charged and
subjected to a Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. This is evident
via a rescaling of the diffusion coefficient entering as a prefactor in the
Kramers escape rate without any impact on the barrier-height-dependent
exponent. Here we show that the barrier height can be effectively changed when
the charged particle is subjected to an external vortex flow. While the
external vortex alone does not affect the mean escape time of the particle,
when combined with a magnetic field it effectively pushes the fluctuating
particle either radially outside or inside depending on its sign relative to
that of the magnetic field. In particular, the effective potential over which
the particle escapes can be changed to a flat, a stable, and an unstable
potential by tuning the signs and magnitudes of the external vortex and the
applied magnetic field. Notably, the last case corresponds to enhanced escape
dynamics.

<h3>Double Half-Heusler Alloys X$_2$Ni$_2$InSb (X= Zr/Hf) with promising  Thermoelectric Performance: Role of varying structural phases</h3>

<br>
<br>
Double half-heusler alloys are the new class of compounds which can be seen
as transmuted version of two single half-heusler with higher flexibility of
tuning their properties. Here, we report a detailed study of thermoelectric
(TE) properties of two double half-heusler (HH) alloys X$_2$Ni$_2$InSb
(X=Hf/Zr), using first-principles calculation. These alloys exhibit a rich
phase diagram with the possibility of tetragonal, cubic and solid solution
phase at different temperature range. As such, a comparative study of TE
properties of all these phases is performed. The ordered phases show quite
favorable electronic transport as compared to the disordered ones in both
compounds. Lattice thermal conductivity of double HH alloys is lower than their
ternary counter-part, making them most promising for TE application. Simulated
band gap, obtained using hybrid functional, of ordered phases of
Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb and Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb lie in the range 0.24-0.4 eV and
0.17-0.59 eV respectively, while for disordered phase, it is 0.05- 0.06 eV.
Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb shows a reasonably high ZT value of $\sim$ 2.19, while
Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb yields 2.46 at high temperature for n-type conduction in
tetragonal phase. The ZT value for p-type conduction is also quite promising
($\sim$ 1.35 and $\sim$ 2.19 for Hf- and Zr-based compounds). In both the
compounds, electronic transport (Seebeck and electrical conductivity) plays the
dominant role for the high ZT-value. Keeping in mind the promising TE
performance, we propose immediate attention from experimentalists to synthesize
and cross validate our findings for these new candidate materials.

Domino tilings of Aztec diamonds are known to exhibit an arctic phenomenon,
namely a separation between frozen regions (in which all the dominoes have the
same orientation) and a central disordered region (where dominoes are found
without any apparent order). This separation was proved to converge, under a
suitable rescaling, to the Airy process whose $1$-point distribution is the
Tracy-Widom distribution. In this work, we conjecture, by means of numerical
analysis, that the boundary between the frozen and disordered regions,
converges, for the same rescaling, to the Airy line ensemble, a generalisation
of the Airy process.

<h3>The phonon thermal Hall angle in black phosphorus</h3>

<br>
The origin of phonon thermal Hall Effect (THE) observed in a variety of
insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on the observation of a
thermal Hall conductivity in a non-magnetic elemental insulator, with an
amplitude exceeding what has been previously observed. In black phosphorus
(BP), the longitudinal ($\kappa_{ii}$), and the transverse, $\kappa_{ij}$,
thermal conductivities peak at the same temperature and at this peak
temperature, the $\kappa_{ij}/\kappa_{jj}/B $ is $\approx 10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$
T$^{-1}$. Both these features are shared by other insulators displaying THE,
despite an absolute amplitude spreading over three orders of magnitude. The
absence of correlation between the thermal Hall angle and the phonon
mean-free-path imposes a severe constraint for theoretical scenarios of THE. We
show that in BP a longitudinal and a transverse acoustic phonon mode
anti-cross, facilitating wave-like transport across modes and the anisotropic
charge distribution surrounding atomic bonds, paving the way for coupling with
magnetic field.

We present a first-principles scheme for incorporating many-body interactions
into the unified description of the quadratic optical response to light of
noncentrosymmetric crystals. The proposed method is based on time-dependent
current-density response theory and includes the electron-hole attraction
\textit{via} a tensorial long-range exchange-correlation kernel, which we
calculate self-consistently using the bootstrap method. By bridging with the
Wannier-interpolation of the independent-particle transition matrix elements,
the resulting numerical scheme is very general and allows resolving narrow
many-body spectral features at low computational cost. We showcase its
potential by inspecting the second-harmonic generation in the benchmark
zinc-blende semiconductor GaAs, the layered graphitic semiconductor BC$_{2}$N
and the Weyl semimetal TaAs. Our results show that excitonic effects can give
rise to large and sharply localized one- and two-photon resonances that are
absent in the independent-particle approximation. We find overall good
agreement with available experimental measurements, capturing the magnitude and
peak-structure of the spectrum as well as the angular dependence at fixed
photon energy. The implementation of the method in Wannier-based code packages
can serve as a basis for performing accurate theoretical predictions of
quadratic optical properties in a vast pool of materials.

<h3>On the saturation stress of deformed metals</h3>

Crystalline materials exhibit an hysteresis behaviour when deformed
cyclically. The origins of this tension-compression asymmetry have been fully
understood only recently as being caused by an asymmetry in the junction
strength and a reduced mean free path of dislocations inherited from previous
deformation stage. Here, we investigate the saturation stress in fcc single-
and poly-crystals using a Crystal Plasticity framework derived from dislocation
dynamics simulations. In the absence of plastic localization and damage
mechanism, the single-crystal mechanical response eventually saturates. We show
that the cyclic saturation stress converges asymptotically to the monotonic
saturation stress as the cycle plastic increment increases, and this
convergence can be observed for some experimental conditions. The analysis of
the experimental literature suggests that the mechanisms controlling the
saturation in single crystals are the same controlling the cyclic response of
polycrystals with large grains. We propose also analytical and approximated
models to predict the saturation stress over the considered loading conditions.
The saturation stress appears as a fundamental property of dislocations,
explaining the consistency observed in the experimental literature. This work
provides a unified view on the monotonous and cyclic responses of fcc single
and poly-crystals, which may help in interpreting experimental data.

<h3>Coexistence of phononic Weyl, nodal line, and threefold excitations in  chalcopyrite CdGeAs$_{2}$ and associated thermoelectric properties</h3>

Realization of topologically protected quantum states leads to unprecedented
opportunities for fundamental science and device applications. Here, we
demonstrate the coexistence of multiple topological phononic states and
calculate the associated thermoelectric properties of a chalcopyrite material
CdGeAs$_2$ using first-principles theoretical modeling. CdGeAs$_{2}$ is a
direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of $0.65$ eV. By analysing the
phonon spectrum and associated symmetries, we show the presence of nearly
isolated Weyl, nodal line, and threefold band crossings in CdGeAs$_2$.
Specifically, the two triply degenerate points (TDPs) identified on the $k_{z}$
axis are formed by the optical phonons bands 7, 8, and 9 with type-II energy
dispersion. These TDPs form a time reversal pair and are connected by a
straight nodal line with zero Berry phase. The TDPs formed between bands 14,
15, and 16 exhibit type-I crossings and are connected through the open straight
nodal line. Our transport calculations show a large thermopower exceeding
$\sim$500 and $200$ $\rm \mu V/K$ for the hole and electron carriers,
respectively, above 500 K with a carrier doping of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. The
large thermopower in $p$-type CdGeAs$_{2}$ is a consequence of the sharp
density of states appear from the presence of a heavy hole band at the $\Gamma$
point. We argue that the presence of topological states in the phonon bands
could lead to low lattice thermal conductivity and drive a high figure-of-merit
in CdGeAs$_{2}$.

The synthesis and design of organic biradicals with tunable singlet-triplet
gaps has become the subject of significant research interest, owing to their
possible photochemical applications and use in the development of molecular
switches and conductors. Recently, tetrathiafulvalene tetrathiolate (TTFtt) has
been demonstrated to exhibit such organic biradical character in doubly ionized
bimetallic complexes. In this article we use high-level {\em ab initio}
calculations to interrogate the electronic structure of a series of
TTFtt-bridged metal complexes, resolving the factors governing their biradical
character and singlet-triplet gaps. We show that the degree of biradical
character correlates with a readily measured experimental predictor, the
central TTFtt C-C bond length, and that it may be described by a one-parameter
model, providing valuable insight for the future rational design of TTFtt based
biradical compounds and materials.

Seismic attenuation in granular porous media is of paramount importance in
rock physics and seismology. Unlike sandstones, shales are mixtures of sand
grains and clays with extremely low porosity and permeability. Swelling of
clays upon wetting induce micro-cracks at grain-clay interfaces and results in
the strong elastic wave scattering. Such scattering prevents adequate
measurements of the absorption from ballistic wave attenuations. Here we infer
this intrinsic attenuation from multiply scattered waves as in seismology and
ultrasonics. We find that increasing confining pressure reduces the scattering
attenuation by micro-crack closure but increases surprisingly the absorption,
likely due to the viscous dissipation involved with more liquids adsorbed in
clays and at grain surfaces. Also, we observe that cyclic heating and cooling
causes the shrinkage of clays and the growth of microcracks as well as the
nucleation of macro-fractures. This leads to a predominant chaotic
reverberation in this fractured shale. Numerical simulations based on X-ray
tomography of the fractured sample confirm the multiple scattering behavior and
reveal the increase of a characteristic length from an initial intact to a
finally fractured shale. This study helps to improve acoustic techniques for
multiscale exploration of gas and oil in shales and other fractured rocks.

Nb3Sn and V3Si thin films are promising candidates as thin films for the next
generation of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities. However,
sputtered films often suffer from stoichiometry and strain issues during
deposition and post annealing. In this study, we explore the structural and
chemical effects of thermal annealing, both in-situ and post-sputtering, on
DC-sputtered Nb3Sn and V3Si films of varying thickness on Nb or Cu substrates,
extending from our initial studies [1]. Through annealing at 950 {\deg}C, we
successfully enabled recrystallization of 100 nm thin Nb3Sn films on Nb
substrate with stoichiometric and strain-free grains. For 2 um thick films, we
observed the removal of strain and a slight increase in grain size with
increasing temperature. Annealing enabled a phase transformation from unstable
to stable structure on V3Si films, while we observed significant Sn loss in 2
um thick Nb3Sn films after high temperature anneals. We observed similar Sn and
Si loss on films atop Cu substrates during annealing, likely due to Cu-Sn and
Cu-Si phase generation and subsequent Sn and Si evaporation. These results
encourage us to refine our process to obtain high-quality sputtered films for
SRF use.

We filled a void with a regular or asymmetric pattern without overlap using a
time-dependent packing method termed random sequential adsorption (RSA). In the
infinite-time limit, the density of coverage frequently hits a limit. This
study focused on the saturation packing of squares and their dimers, trimers,
tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers, all of which were orientated in two
randomly chosen orientations (vertical and horizontal). Our results concurred
with those of previous extrapolation-based research1. We used the "separating
axis theorem" to detect if freshly added polygons and previously put ones
overlapped. When RSA insertion became disproportionately sluggish, we concluded
that saturation had been attained. We also discovered that the system's
capacity to fill the area decreased as squares were stretched into dimers and
trimmers. The microstructure of the resultant saturation was also thoroughly
investigated, including block function and the structural arrangement of dimers
and trimers. Based on results of ref2, it is predicted that layer adsorbed onto
a substrate will not hinder diffusion. Moreover, it was found that the adsorbed
rectangles' aspect ratio had an impact on the coverage percentage at the
jamming limit, with aspect ratios of 2 (like dimers here) producing the highest
jamming coverage. As a result, the current results are a more in-depth
expansion of the report in reference3.

Combining chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with electrochemical polish (EP)
operations is a promising route to producing performance-capable
superconducting films for use in the fabrication of cost-effective components
for superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) particle accelerators and
superconducting quantum computers. The post-deposition EP process enables a
critically necessary reduction in surface roughness of niobium thin films to
promote optimal superconducting surface conditions. In this work, surface
morphology, roughness, and crystal orientation of the CVD-grown and EP-polished
niobium films were investigated. The grain growth and polishing mechanisms were
analyzed. The CVD films were found to comprise steps, kinks, and pyramidal
features, resulting in undesirable large peak-to-valley distances. The
electrochemical polish was demonstrated to significantly diminish the height of
pyramids and effectively minimize the overall surface roughness. In contrast to
buffered chemical polishing (BCP), EP results showed a probable dependence on
crystal orientation, suggesting this process was influenced by locally enhanced
current density and thickness variations of oxide dielectrics. These
understandings identify the EP principles tied to CVD-grown Nb films that allow
further refinement of surface profiles for film-based SRF applications

Semiconductor moir\'e superlattices comprise an array of artificial atoms and
provide a highly tunable platform for exploring novel electronic phases. We
introduce a theoretical framework for studying moir\'e quantum matter, which
treats intra-moir\'e-atom interactions exactly and is controlled in the limit
of large moir\'e period. We reveal an abundance of new physics arising from
strong electron interactions when multiple occupancy of moir\'e atoms is
involved. In particular, Coulomb interaction in three-electron moir\'e atoms
leads to a three-lobed ``Wigner molecule'', which forms an emergent Kagome
lattice at filling factor $n=3$. Our work identifies two universal length
scales characterizing the kinetic and interaction energies in moir\'e materials
and demonstrates a rich phase diagram due to their interplay.
