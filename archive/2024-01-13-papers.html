<h3>Non-Gaussian diffusive fluctuations in Dirac fluids</h3>

<i>Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Ewan McCulloch, Romain Vasseur</i>
<p>Dirac fluids - interacting systems obeying particle-hole symmetry and Lorentz
invariance - are among the simplest hydrodynamic systems; they have also been
studied as effective descriptions of transport in strongly interacting Dirac
semimetals. Direct experimental signatures of the Dirac fluid are elusive, as
its charge transport is diffusive as in conventional metals. In this paper we
point out a striking consequence of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics: the
full counting statistics (FCS) of charge transport is highly non-gaussian. We
predict the exact asymptotic form of the FCS, which generalizes a result
previously derived for certain interacting integrable systems. A consequence is
that, starting from quasi-one dimensional nonequilibrium initial conditions,
charge noise in the hydrodynamic regime is parametrically enhanced relative to
that in conventional diffusive metals.

<h3>Self-supporting Structure of Bird Nests</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05371</a>
<br>
<i>Yuming Chen, Yifang Xu, Yiran Yao, Sihui Wang</i>
<p>The mystery behind the bird nest's construction is not well understood. Our
study focuses on the stability of a self-supporting nest-like structure.
Firstly, we derived a stable/unstable phase boundary for the structure at the
fixed coefficient of friction with varying geometrical parameters through force
analysis. Structures with a lower height and greater friction coefficient
between rods are more stable. The theoretical phase boundary matched the
experiment results well. Then we investigate the nest structure's stability
under applied weight. Static structures with lower height and more rods
(five>four>three) are more stable. Our theory also predicts a transition from
plastic phase to elastic phase. These theoretical predictions are all confirmed
by experiment. In the experiment, we also find that wet rod structures are more
stable than dry ones. The structures can support up to 100 times of it's
weight. Finally, we test the nest structure's stability under vibration. When
there are no weights applied, we are able to identify the appropriate geometric
configuration that can withstand the greatest vibration ($1g$ of vibration
acceleration and vibration energy up to $4\times10^{-4}$ times of a rod's
maximum potential energy). The critical vibration energy and acceleration
depend on the applied weights. They are increased by two and one order of
magnitude respectively under proper weight. We also make potential energy
analysis to explain the stability of the structure.

<h3>Vector Field Oriented Diffusion Model for Crystal Material Generation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05402</a>
<br>
<i>Astrid Klipfel, Yaël Fregier, Adlane Sayede, Zied Bouraoui</i>
<p>Discovering crystal structures with specific chemical properties has become
an increasingly important focus in material science. However, current models
are limited in their ability to generate new crystal lattices, as they only
consider atomic positions or chemical composition. To address this issue, we
propose a probabilistic diffusion model that utilizes a geometrically
equivariant GNN to consider atomic positions and crystal lattices jointly. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new generation metric
inspired by Frechet Inception Distance, but based on GNN energy prediction
rather than InceptionV3 used in computer vision. In addition to commonly used
metrics like validity, which assesses the plausibility of a structure, this new
metric offers a more comprehensive evaluation of our model's capabilities. Our
experiments on existing benchmarks show the significance of our diffusion
model. We also show that our method can effectively learn meaningful
representations.

<h3>On the zero-field quantization of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in  moiré 2D layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05485</a>
<br>
<i>Sankar Das Sarma, Ming Xie</i>
<p>In recent breakthrough experiments, twisted moir\'e layers of transition
metal dichalcogenides are found to manifest both integer (IQAHE) and fractional
(FQAHE) quantum anomalous Hall effects in zero applied magnetic field because
of the underlying flat band topology and spontaneous breaking of the time
reversal invariance. In the current work, we critically analyze the
experimental values of the quantized conductance in each case to emphasize the
role of disorder in the problem, pointing out that obtaining accurate quantized
conductance in future experiments would necessitate better contacts and lower
disorder.

<h3>Migdal-Eliashberg superconductivity in a Kondo lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05486</a>
<br>
<i>Samuel Awelewa, Maxim Dzero</i>
<p>We apply the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity to heavy-fermion
and mixed valence materials. Specifically, we extend the Anderson lattice model
to a case when there exists a strong coupling between itinerant electrons and
lattice vibrations. Using the saddle-point approximation, we derive a set of
coupled nonlinear equations which describe competition between the crossover to
a heavy-fermion or mixed-valence regimes and conventional superconductivity. We
find that superconductivity at strong coupling emerges on par with the
development of the many-body coherence in a Kondo lattice. Superconductivity is
gradually suppressed with the onset of the Kondo screening and for strong
electron-phonon coupling the Kondo screening exhibits a characteristic
re-entrant behavior. Even though for both weak and strong coupling limits the
suppression of superconductivity is weaker in the mixed-valence regime compared
to the local moment one, superconducting critical temperature still remains
nonzero. In the weak coupling limit the onset of the many body coherence
develops gradually, in the strong coupling limit it emerges abruptly in the
mixed valence regime while in the local moment regime the $f$-electrons remain
effectively decoupled from the conduction electrons. Possibility of
experimental realization of these effects in Ce-based compounds is also
discussed.

<h3>Topological superconductivity induced by a Kitaev spin liquid</h3>

<br>
<i>Sondre Duna Lundemo, Asle Sudbø</i>
<p>We study the effective low-energy fermionic theory of the Kondo-Kitaev model
to leading order in the Kondo coupling. Our main goal is to understand the
nature of the superconducting instability induced in the proximate metal due to
its coupling to spin fluctuations of the spin liquid. The special combination
of the low-energy modes of a graphene-like metal and the form of the
interaction induced by the Majorana excitations of the spin liquid furnish
chiral superconducting order with $p_x + \mathrm{i} p_y$ symmetry. Computing
its response to a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field moreover shows that this
superconducting state is topologically non-trivial, characterized by a first
Chern number of $\pm 2$.

<h3>A Cold-Atom Particle Collider</h3>

<br>
<i>Guo-Xian Su, Jesse Osborne, Jad C. Halimeh</i>
<p>A major objective of the strong ongoing drive to realize quantum simulators
of gauge theories is achieving the capability to probe collider-relevant
physics on them. In this regard, a highly pertinent and sought-after
application is the controlled collisions of elementary and composite particles,
as well as the scattering processes in their wake. Here, we propose
particle-collision experiments in a cold-atom quantum simulator for a $1+1$D
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory with a tunable topological $\theta$-term,
where we demonstrate an experimentally feasible protocol to impart momenta to
elementary (anti)particles and their meson composites. We numerically benchmark
the collisions of moving wave packets for both elementary and composite
particles, uncovering a plethora of rich phenomena, such as oscillatory string
dynamics in the wake of elementary (anti)particle collisions due to
confinement. We also probe string inversion and entropy production processes
across Coleman's phase transition through far-from-equilibrium quenches. We
further demonstrate how collisions of composite particles unveil their internal
structure. Our work paves the way towards the experimental investigation of
collision dynamics in state-of-the-art quantum simulators of gauge theories,
and sets the stage for microscopic understanding of collider-relevant physics
in these platforms.

<h3>Principles of 2D terahertz spectroscopy of collective excitations: the  case of Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05503" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05503</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Gómez Salvador, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Marios H. Michael, Albert Liu, Danica Pavicevic, Michael Fechner, Andrea Cavalleri, Eugene Demler</i>
<p>Two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS), a terahertz analogue of
nuclear magnetic resonance, is a new technique poised to address many open
questions in complex condensed matter systems. The conventional theoretical
framework used ubiquitously for interpreting multidimensional spectra of
discrete quantum level systems is, however, insufficient for the continua of
collective excitations in strongly correlated materials. Here, we develop a
theory for 2DTS of a model collective excitation, the Josephson plasma
resonance in layered superconductors. Starting from a mean-field approach at
temperatures well below the superconducting phase transition, we obtain
expressions for the multidimensional nonlinear responses that are amenable to
intuition derived from the conventional single-mode scenario. We then consider
temperatures near the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, where
dynamics beyond mean-field become important and conventional intuition fails.
As fluctuations proliferate near $T_c$, the dominant contribution to nonlinear
response comes from an optical parametric drive of counter-propagating
Josephson plasmons, which gives rise to 2D spectra that are qualitatively
different from the mean-field predictions. As such, and in contrast to
one-dimensional spectroscopy techniques, such as third harmonic generation,
2DTS can be used to directly probe thermally excited finite-momentum plasmons
and their interactions. Our theory provides a clear interpretation of recent
2DTS measurements on cuprates, and we discuss implications beyond the present
context of Josephson plasmons.

<h3>On the flattening trend of thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7 at  ultra-high temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05537" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05537</a>
<br>
<i>Hao Zhou, Janak Tiwari, Tianli Feng</i>
<p>Many crystals, such as lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7), exhibit a flattening
trend in thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon has
recently been attributed to the inter-band phonon tunneling (or diffuson)
contribution using different formalisms. However, the contributions of
finite-temperature corrections (e.g., higher-order phonon-scattering, phonon
renormalization, and phonon scattering cross-section softening effects) remain
unclear. In this work, we predict and compare the thermal conductivity of
La2Zr2O7 using three distinct first-principles methods. The first method is
Green-Kubo molecular dynamics (MD) based on temperature-dependent machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained from ab initio MD simulations,
which successfully predict the flattening trend at ultra-high temperatures. The
second method is the Peierls Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), within the
phonon particle framework, using phonon lifetime that includes all the
finite-temperature corrections. Four-phonon scattering is found large but is
cancelled by the phonon scattering cross-section softening effect. As a result,
BTE with temperature corrections does not reproduce the flattening of thermal
conductivity. The third method is Wigner formalism, which includes both phonon
particle and wave contributions, which successfully reproduce the flattening of
thermal conductivity. Diffuson and phonon contribute about 67% and 28% of
thermal conductivity at 1800 K, respectively. The radiation contribution to
thermal conductivity is around 5%. The scaling laws of the phonon, diffuson,
radiation, and total thermal conductivity are found to be ~T^-1, ~T^0.4, ~T^2,
and ~T^-0.4, respectively. This work clarifies the thermal transport mechanisms
in La2Zr2O7 at ultra-high temperatures from different aspects.

<h3>Static and fluctuating zigzag order, and possible signatures of Kitaev  physics, in torque measurements of $α$-RuCl${_3}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05546</a>
<br>
<i>Shaun Froude-Powers, Subin Kim, Jacob Gordon, Hae-Young Kee, Young-June Kim, Stephen R. Julian</i>
<p>We have measured magnetic torque on a T${_N}$ = 7 K single crystal of
${\alpha}$-RuCl${_3}$ , as a function of the field angle in the ab-plane,
focusing on temperatures between 2 and 20 K and fields from 0 to 9 T. We find a
rich spectrum of signals, many of which can be classified by their angular
periodicity. The sample shows an oscillation with a period of 180$^{\circ}$
(i.e. two-fold periodicity) which we argue is due to residual strain within the
crystal, rather than being intrinsic. In addition, within the magnetically
ordered zigzag phase there is a 60$^{\circ}$ period (i.e. six-fold) sawtooth
pattern, which can be explained by reorientation of the zigzag domains as the
crystal rotates in the applied field. Suppressing the zigzag order with an
applied field above ${\sim}$ 8 T at low temperature, a six-fold sinusoidal
signal remains, suggesting that there is fluctuating zigzag order in the
putative field-induced quantum spin liquid state. Finally, our key finding is a
sharp, step-like feature that appears at low temperature for fields just above
the zigzag phase boundary, at the so-called B2-axes. This is similar to
theoretically predicted behaviour for a state with Ising topological order,
which is expected for a Kitaev spin liquid in an applied magnetic field.

<h3>Cross-extrapolation reconstruction of low-rank functions and application  to quantum many-body observables in the strong coupling regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05547" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05547</a>
<br>
<i>Matthieu Jeannin, Yuriel Núñez-Fernández, Thomas Kloss, Olivier Parcollet, Xavier Waintal</i>
<p>We present a general-purpose algorithm to extrapolate a low rank function of
two variables from a small domain to a larger one. It is based on the
cross-interpolation formula. We apply it to reconstruct physical quantities in
some quantum many-body perturbative expansions in the real time Keldysh
formalism, considered as a function of time $t$ and interaction $U$. These
functions are of remarkably low rank. This property, combined with the
convergence of the perturbative expansion in $U$ both at finite $t$ (for any
$U$), and small $U$ (for any $t$), is sufficient for our algorithm to
reconstruct the physical quantity at long time, strong coupling regime. Our
method constitutes an alternative to standard resummation techniques in
perturbative methods, such as diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo. We benchmark it
on the single impurity Anderson model and show that it is successful even in
some regime where standard conformal mapping resummation techniques fail.

<h3>Transverse and longitudinal magnons in strongly anisotropic  antiferromagnet FePSe3</h3>

<i>F. Le Mardele, A. El Mendili, M. E. Zhitomirsky, I. Mohelsky, D. Jana, I. Plutnarova, Z. Sofer, C. Faugeras, M. Potemski, M. Orlita</i>
<p>FePSe3 is a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with an easy-axis anisotropy
and large spins S=2. It belongs to a family of magnetic van der Waals
materials, which recently attracted a considerable attention. In this work we
present an experimental magneto-optical study of the low-energy excitation
spectrum in FePSe3, together with its theoretical description. The observed
response contains several types of magnon excitations. Two of them are
conventional transverse magnons described by a classical theory of
antiferromagnetic resonance. Two other modes are identified as multimagnon
hexadecapole excitations with an anomalous g factor approximately equal to four
times the g factor of a single Fe^2+ ion. These quasiparticles correspond to
full reversals of iron spins that coherently propagate in the up-down
antiferromagnetic structure. They constitute a novel type of collective
excitations in anisotropic magnetic solids, called longitudinal magnons.
Comparison between theory and experiment allows us to estimate the microscopic
parameters of FePSe3 including exchange coupling constants and the single-ion
anisotropy.

<h3>Topological defects in multi-layered swarming bacteria</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05560" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05560</a>
<br>
<i>Victor Yashunsky, Daniel J.G. Pearce, Gil Ariel, Avraham Be'er</i>
<p>Topological defects, which are singular points in a director field, play a
major role in shaping active systems. Here, we experimentally study topological
defects and the flow patterns around them, that are formed during the highly
rapid dynamics of swarming bacteria. The results are compared to the
predictions of two-dimensional active nematics. We show that, even though some
of the assumptions underlying the theory do not hold, the swarm dynamics is in
agreement with two-dimensional nematic theory. In particular, we look into the
multi-layered structure of the swarm, which is an important feature of real,
natural colonies, and find a strong coupling between layers. Our results
suggest that the defect-charge density is hyperuniform, i.e., that long range
density-fluctuations are suppressed.

<h3>A Universal Scaling Law for Intrinsic Fracture Energy of Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05564</a>
<br>
<i>Chase Hartquist, Shu Wang, Qiaodong Cui, Wojciech Matusik, Bolei Deng, Xuanhe Zhao</i>
<p>Networks of interconnected materials permeate throughout nature, biology, and
technology due to exceptional mechanical performance. Despite the importance of
failure resistance in network design and utility, no existing physical model
effectively links strand mechanics and connectivity to predict bulk fracture.
Here, we reveal a universal scaling law that bridges these levels to predict
the intrinsic fracture energy of diverse networks. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate its remarkable applicability to a breadth of strand constitutive
behaviors, topologies, dimensionalities, and length scales. We show that local
strand rupture and nonlocal energy release contribute synergistically to the
measured intrinsic fracture energy in networks. These effects coordinate such
that the intrinsic fracture energy scales independent of the energy to rupture
a strand; it instead depends on the strand rupture force, breaking length, and
connectivity. Our scaling law establishes a physical basis for understanding
network fracture and a framework for fabricating tough materials from networks
across multiple length scales.

<h3>Phase discovery with active learning: Application to structural phase  transitions in equiatomic NiTi</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05568</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Vandermause, Anders Johansson, Yucong Miao, Joost J. Vlassak, Boris Kozinsky</i>
<p>Nickel titanium (NiTi) is a protypical shape-memory alloy used in a range of
biomedical and engineering devices, but direct molecular dynamics simulations
of the martensitic B19' -> B2 phase transition driving its shape-memory
behavior are rare and have relied on classical force fields with limited
accuracy. Here, we train four machine-learned force fields for equiatomic NiTi
based on the LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN DFT functionals. The models are trained
on the fly during NPT molecular dynamics, with DFT calculations and model
updates performed automatically whenever the uncertainty of a local energy
prediction exceeds a chosen threshold. The models achieve accuracies of 1-2
meV/atom during training and are shown to closely track DFT predictions of B2
and B19' elastic constants and phonon frequencies. Surprisingly, in large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations, only the SCAN model predicts a reversible B19'
-> B2 phase transition, with the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol models predicting a
reversible transition to a previously uncharacterized low-volume phase, which
we hypothesize to be a new stable high-pressure phase. We examine the structure
of the new phase and estimate its stability on the temperature-pressure phase
diagram. This work establishes an automated active learning protocol for
studying displacive transformations, reveals important differences between DFT
functionals that can only be detected in large-scale simulations, provides an
accurate force field for NiTi, and identifies a new phase.

<h3>Structural transition and uranium valence change in UTe$_2$ at high  pressure revealed by x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy</h3>

<i>Yuhang Deng, Eric Lee-Wong, Camilla M. Moir, Ravhi S. Kumar, Nathan Swedan, Changyong Park, Dmitry Yu Popov, Yuming Xiao, Paul Chow, Ryan E. Baumbach, Russell J. Hemley, M. Brian Maple</i>
<p>High pressure x-ray diffraction up to 30 GPa and resonant emission x-ray
spectroscopy and partial fluorescence yield x-ray absorption spectroscopy up to
52 GPa were used to study how the structural and electronic properties of
UTe$_2$ evolve with pressure at room temperature. An orthorhombic to tetragonal
phase transition was observed to occur between 5 and 7 GPa, with a large volume
collapse of nearly 11% and a nearest U-U distance increase by about 4%. This
lower to higher symmetry transition suggests less 5f electron participation in
bonding when the weakly correlated superconducting phase in the tetragonal
structure of UTe$_2$ appears. Beyond 7 GPa, no new structural transitions were
found up to 30 GPa. The resonant x-ray emission spectra clearly demonstrate an
intermediate valence of U, nearly +3.74 at 1.8 GPa and room temperature, and
reveal that the U valence shifts towards 4+, passes through a peak at 2.8 GPa,
and then decreases towards 3+ and settles down to a nearly constant value above
15 GPa. These experiments reveal that some fundamental structural and valence
changes occur in UTe2 at relatively low pressures, which could be responsible
for the interplay between unconventional superconductivity, magnetic ordering,
and weakly correlated superconductivity that is manifested in the
temperature-pressure phase diagram of UTe2.

<h3>Room-temperature Magnetic Thermal Switching by Suppressing Phonon-Magnon  Scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05607" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05607</a>
<br>
<i>Fanghao Zhang, Lokanath Patra, Yubi Chen, Wenkai Ouyang, Paul Sarte, Shantal Adajian, Xiangying Zuo, Runqing Yang, Tengfei Luo, Bolin Liao</i>
<p>Thermal switching materials, whose thermal conductivity can be controlled
externally, show great potential in contemporary thermal management.
Manipulating thermal transport properties through magnetic fields has been
accomplished in materials that exhibit a high magnetoresistance. However, it is
generally understood that the lattice thermal conductivity attributed to
phonons is not significantly impacted by the magnetic fields. In this study, we
experimentally demonstrate the significant impact of phonon-magnon scattering
on the thermal conductivity of the rare-earth metal gadolinium near room
temperature, which can be controlled by a magnetic field to realize thermal
switching. Using first-principles lattice dynamics and spin-lattice dynamics
simulations, we attribute the observed change in phononic thermal conductivity
to field-suppressed phonon-magnon scattering. This research suggests that
phonon-magnon scattering in ferromagnetic materials is crucial for determining
their thermal conductivity, opening the door to innovative
magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching materials.

<h3>Deciphering Interphase Instability of Lithium Metal Batteries with  Localized High-Concentration Electrolytes at Elevated Temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05671</a>
<br>
<i>Tao Meng, Shanshan Yang, Yitong Peng, Xiwei Lan, Pingan Li, Kangjia Hu, Xianluo Hu</i>
<p>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs), when coupled with a localized
high-concentration electrolyte and a high-voltage nickel-rich cathode, offer a
solution to the increasing demand for high energy density and long cycle life.
However, the aggressive electrode chemistry poses safety risks to LMBs at
higher temperatures and cutoff voltages. Here, we decipher the interphase
instability in LHCE-based LMBs with a Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode at elevated
temperatures. Our findings reveal that the generation of fluorine radicals in
the electrolyte induces the solvent decomposition and consequent chain
reactions, thereby reconstructing the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and
degrading battery cyclability. As further evidenced, introducing an acid
scavenger of dimethoxydimethylsilane (DODSi) significantly boosts CEI stability
with suppressed microcracking. A Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell with this
DODSi-functionalized LHCE achieves an unprecedented capacity retention of 93.0%
after 100 cycles at 80 {\deg}C. This research provides insights into
electrolyte engineering for practical LMBs with high safety under extreme
temperatures.

<h3>Josephson Junction of Nodal Superconductors with Rashba and Ising  Spin-Orbit coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05685</a>
<br>
<i>Gal Cohen, Ranjani Seshadri, Maxim Khodas, Dganit Meidan</i>
<p>We study the effect of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the nodal
superconducting phase of an Ising superconductor. Such nodal phase was
predicted to occur when applying an in-plane field beyond the Pauli limit to a
superconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). Generically,
Rashba spin-orbit is known to lift the chiral symmetry that protects the nodal
points, resulting in a fully gapped phase. However, when the magnetic field is
applied along the $\Gamma -K $ line, a residual vertical mirror symmetry
protects a nodal crystalline phase. We study a single-band tight-binding model
that captures the low energy physics around the $\Gamma $ pocket of monolayer
TMD. We calculate the topological properties, the edge state structure, and the
current phase relation in a Josephson junction geometry of the nodal
crystalline phase. We show that while the nodal crystalline phase is
characterized by localized edge modes on non-self-reflecting boundaries, the
current phase relation exhibits a trivial $2\pi $ periodicity in the presence
of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Atomic Scale Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Monolayer Graphene/$\rm  MnBi_{2}Te_{4}$ Heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<i>Yueh-Ting Yao, Suyang Xu, Tay-Rong Chang</i>
<p>The two-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is direct evidence of
non-trivial Berry curvature topology in condensed matter physics. Searching for
QAH in 2D materials, particularly with simplified fabrication methods, poses a
significant challenge in future applications. Despite numerous theoretical
works proposed for the QAH effect with $C=2$ in graphene, neglecting magnetism
sources such as proper substrate effects remain experimental evidence absent.
In this work, we propose the QAH effect in graphene/$\rm MnBi_{2}Te_{4}$ (MBT)
heterostructure based on density-functional theory (DFT). The monolayer MBT
introduces spin-orbital coupling, Zeeman exchange field, and Kekul$\rm
\acute{e}$ distortion as a substrate effect into graphene, resulting in QAH

<h3>Dynamical Chiral Symmetry and Symmetry-Class Conversion in Floquet  Topological Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697</a>
<br>
<i>Mohamed Assili, Panagiotis Kotetes</i>
<p>In this work, we discuss properties with no static counterpart arising in
Floquet topological insulators with a dynamical chiral symmetry (DCS), i.e., a
chiral symmetry which is present while driving. We explore the topological
properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not
survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives
and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency
space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving
has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero
quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\pi$
quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation
vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain
model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding
the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We
demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is
topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a
CI$\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor
topological $\pi$-modes. Notably, the arising topological phases strongly
depend on whether the DCS has a static analog or not. Our results bring Floquet
insulators with nonstandard DCS forward as ideal candidate platforms for
engineering and manipulating topological $\pi$-modes.

<h3>Orbital Hanle Magnetoresistance in a 3d Transition Metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05703</a>
<br>
<i>Giacomo Sala, Hanchen Wang, William Legrand, Pietro Gambardella</i>
<p>The Hanle magnetoresistance is a telltale signature of spin precession in
nonmagnetic conductors, in which strong spin-orbit coupling generates edge spin
accumulation via the spin Hall effect. Here, we report the existence of a large
Hanle magnetoresistance in single layers of Mn with weak spin-orbit coupling,
which we attribute to the orbital Hall effect. The simultaneous observation of
a sizable Hanle magnetoresistance and vanishing small spin Hall
magnetoresistance in BiYIG/Mn bilayers corroborates the orbital origin of both
effects. We estimate an orbital Hall angle of 0.016, an orbital relaxation time
of 2 ps and diffusion length of the order of 2 nm in disordered Mn. Our
findings indicate that current-induced orbital moments are responsible for
magnetoresistance effects comparable to or even larger than those determined by
spin moments, and provide a tool to investigate nonequilibrium orbital
transport phenomena.

<h3>Deterministic and stochastic aspects of current-induced magnetization  reversal in perpendicular nanomagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05704" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05704</a>
<br>
<i>Giacomo Sala, Jan Meyer, Anne Flechsig, Laura Gabriel, Pietro Gambardella</i>
<p>We study the incubation and transition times that characterize the
magnetization switching induced by spin-orbit torques in nanomagnets with
perpendicular anisotropy. We present a phenomenological model to interpret the
dependence of the incubation time on the amplitude of the voltage pulse and
assisting magnetic field and estimate the volume of the seed domain that
triggers the switching. Our measurements evidence a correlation between the
incubation and transition times that is mediated by the temperature variation
during the electric pulse. In addition, we discuss the stochastic distributions
of the two times in terms of the energy barriers opposing the nucleation and
expansion of the seed domain. We propose two models based on the log-normal and
gamma functions to account for the different origin of the variability of the
incubation and transition times, which are associated with a single nucleation
barrier and multiple pinning sites, respectively.

<h3>Disorder scattering in classical flat channel transport of particles  between twisted magnetic square patterns</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05706</a>
<br>
<i>Anna M. E. B. Rossi, Adrian Ernst, Magdalena Dörfler, Thomas M. Fischer</i>
<p>We measure the trajectories of macroscopic magnetic particles pulled against
gravity between twisted alternating magnetic square patterns in a superposed
homogeneous magnetic field normal to both patterns. The two patterns are built
from a set of magentic cubes having a distribution of magnetization. The
magnetic potential between the patterns is a sum of three contributions: two
being periodic on two lattices with different magnitude and orientation, and
the third random contribution arising from the distribution of magnetization of
the cubes. As one varies the twist angle between the two patterns each time the
twist angle coincides with a magic twist angle one of the two periodic lattices
becomes a sublattice of the other lattice. Simulations of particles moving
through patterns with a precise cube magnetization produce pronounced mobility
peaks near magic twist angles that are associated with flat channels. Weak
random fluctuations of the cube magnetization in the experiment and the
simulations cause enhanced random disorder of the potential and reduce the
mobility by scattering particles into the interior of the twisted Wigner Seitz
cells. The mobility undergoes an Anderson transition from magic to generic
behavior as the magnetization disorder increases beyond half of a percent of
the cube magnetization.

<h3>Micromagnetic simulations of the size dependence of the Curie  temperature in ferromagnetic nanowires and nanolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05722</a>
<br>
<i>Clémentine Courtès, Matthieu Boileau, Raphaël Côte, Paul-Antoine Hervieux, Giovanni Manfredi</i>
<p>We solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the finite-temperature
regime, where thermal fluctuations are modeled by a random magnetic field whose
variance is proportional to the temperature. By rescaling the temperature
proportionally to the computational cell size $\Delta x$ ($T \to T\,\Delta
x/a_{\text{eff}}$, where $a_{\text{eff}}$ is the lattice constant) [M. B. Hahn,
J. Phys. Comm., 3:075009, 2019], we obtain Curie temperatures $T_{\text{C}}$
that are in line with the experimental values for cobalt, iron and nickel. For
finite-sized objects such as nanowires (1D) and nanolayers (2D), the Curie
temperature varies with the smallest size $d$ of the system. We show that the
difference between the computed finite-size $T_{\text{C}}$ and the bulk
$T_{\text{C}}$ follows a power-law of the type: $(\xi_0/d)^\lambda$, where
$\xi_0$ is the correlation length at zero temperature, and $\lambda$ is a
critical exponent. We obtain values of $\xi_0$ in the nanometer range, also in
accordance with other simulations and experiments. The computed critical
exponent is close to $\lambda=2$ for all considered materials and geometries.
This is the expected result for a mean-field approach, but slightly larger than
the values observed experimentally.

<h3>Analytical impact excitation of Er/O/B co-doped Si light emitting diodes</h3>

<i>Xiaoming Wang, Jiajing He, Ao Wang, Kun Zhang, Yufei Sheng, Weida Hu, Chaoyuan Jin, Hua Bao, Yaping Dan</i>
<p>Er doped Si light emitting diodes may find important applications in the
generation and storage of quantum information. These diodes exhibit an emission
efficiency two orders of magnitude higher at reverse bias than forward bias due
to impact excitation. However, physics of impact excitation in these devices
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we fabricated an Er/O/B co-doped Si
light emitting diode which exhibits a strong electro-luminescence by the impact
excitation of electrons inelastically colliding the Er ions. An analytical
impact excitation theory was established to predict the electroluminescence
intensity and internal quantum efficiency which fit well with the experimental
data. From the fittings, we find that the excitable Er ions reach a record
concentration of 1.9 x 10^19 cm-3 and up to 45% of them are in excitation state
by impact excitation. This work has important implications for developing
efficient classical and quantum light sources based on rare earth elements.

<h3>Open-loop quantum control of small-size networks for high-order  cumulants and cross-correlations sensing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05766" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05766</a>
<br>
<i>Antonio D'Arrigo, Giulia Piccitto, Giuseppe Falci, Elisabetta Paladino</i>
<p>Quantum control techniques represent one of the most efficient tools to
attain high-fidelity quantum operations and a convenient approach for quantum
sensing and quantum noise spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate dynamical
decoupling while processing an entangling two-qubit gate based on an Ising-xx
interaction, each qubit being affected by pure dephasing classical correlated
1/ f -noises. To evaluate the gate error, we used the Magnus expansion
introducing generalized filter functions that describe decoupling while
processing and allow us to derive an approximate analytic expression as a
hierarchy of nested integrals of noise cumulants. The error is separated in
contributions of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, the corresponding generalized
filter functions being calculated up to the fourth order. By exploiting the
properties of selected pulse sequences, we show that it is possible to extract
the second-order statistics (spectrum and cross-spectrum) and to highlight
non-Gaussian features contained in the fourth-order cumulant. We discuss the
applicability of these results to state-of-the-art small networks based on
solid-state platforms.

<h3>There and back again: bridging meso- and nanoscales to understand lipid  vesicle patterning</h3>

<br>
<i>Julie Cornet, Nelly Coulonges, Weria Pezeshkian, Maël Penissat-Mahaut, Siewert-Jan Marrink, Nicolas Destainville, Matthieu Chavent, Manoel Manghi</i>
<p>We describe a complete methodology to bridge the scales between nanoscale
Molecular Dynamics and (micrometer) mesoscale Monte Carlo simulations in lipid
membranes and vesicles undergoing phase separation, in which curving molecular
species are furthermore embedded. To go from the molecular to the mesoscale, we
notably appeal to physical renormalization arguments enabling us to rigorously
infer the mesoscale interaction parameters from its molecular counterpart. We
also explain how to deal with the physical timescales at stake at the
mesoscale. Simulating the so-obtained mesoscale system enables us to
equilibrate the long wavelengths of the vesicles of interest, up to the vesicle
size. Conversely, we then backmap from the meso- to the nano- scale, which
enables us to equilibrate in turn the short wavelengths down to the molecular
length-scales. By applying our approach to the specific situation of the
patterning of a vesicle membrane, we show that macroscopic membranes can thus
be equilibrated at all length-scales in achievable computational time offering
an original strategy to address the fundamental challenge of time scale in
simulations of large bio-membrane systems.

<h3>Giant piezoelectric effects of topological structures in stretched  ferroelectric membranes</h3>

<br>
<i>Yihao Hu, Jiyuan Yang, Shi Liu</i>
<p>Freestanding ferroelectric oxide membranes emerge as a promising platform for
exploring the interplay between topological polar ordering and dipolar
interactions that are continuously tunable by strain. Our investigations
combining density functional theory (DFT) and deep-learning-assisted molecular
dynamics simulations demonstrate that DFT-predicted strain-driven morphotropic
phase boundary involving monoclinic phases manifest as diverse domain
structures at room temperatures, featuring continuous distributions of dipole
orientations and mobile domain walls. Detailed analysis of dynamic structures
reveals that the enhanced piezoelectric response observed in stretched
PbTiO$_3$ membranes results from small-angle rotations of dipoles at domain
walls, distinct from conventional polarization rotation mechanism and adaptive
phase theory inferred from static structures. We identify a ferroelectric
topological structure, termed "dipole spiral," which exhibits a giant intrinsic
piezoelectric response ($>$320 pC/N). This helical structure, primarily
stabilized by entropy and possessing a rotational zero-energy mode, unlocks new
possibilities for exploring chiral phonon dynamics and dipolar
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interactions.

<h3>Tuning the Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Double Transition Metal  MCrCT$_2$ (M = Ti, Mo) Janus MXenes for Enhanced Spintronics and  Nanoelectronics</h3>

<i>Swetarekha Ram, Namitha Anna Koshi, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee</i>
<p>Janus MXenes, a new category of two-dimensional (2D) materials, shows
promising potential for advances in optoelectronics, spintronics and
nanoelectronics. Our theoretical investigations not only provide interesting
insights but also highlight the promise of Janus MCrCT$_2$ (M = Ti, Mo; T = O,
F, OH) MXenes for future spintronic applications and highlight the need for
their synthesis. Electronic structure analysis shows different metallic and
semi-metallic properties: MoCrCF$_2$ exhibits metallic properties,
TiCrC(OH)$_2$ and MoCrCO$_2$ exhibit near semi-metallicity with spin
polarization values of 61\% and 86\%, respectively, while TiCrCO$_2$ and
TiCrCF$_2$ are completely half-metallic with 100\% spin polarization at the
Fermi level. All studied Janus MXenes exhibit intrinsic ferromagnetism, which
is mainly attributed to the chromium (Cr) atoms, as shown by the spin density
difference plots. Among them, the TiCrCO$_2$ monolayer stands out with the
highest exchange constant and ferromagnetic transition temperature (T$_c$).
Notably, the O-terminated Janus MXenes exhibit weak perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, in contrast to the in-plane anisotropy observed for F and
OH-terminated MXenes, making them particularly interesting for future
spintronic applications which we further demonstrate with micromagnetic
simulation which reveal distinct current-induced switching behaviors in these
Janus MXenes with different surface terminations.

<i>P.A. Gladilovich, A.V. Sabluk, P.S. Burtsev, R. Migdisov, N. Maleeva, S.V. Shitov</i>
<p>Various techniques are available in order to obtain information on samples of
a different nature in near-field scanning microwave microscopy (NSMM), with
transmission-line resonator (TLR) techniques considered as the most advanced in
terms of sensitivity and resolution. In this paper, we focus on development of
a TLR-based NSMM supplied by a new source of useful signal: coplanar waveguide
ground potentials imbalance. Electromagnetic modeling of the device and
experimental scanning of two planar structures are conducted to examine the
performance of the proposed technique. Both modeling and experimental results
demonstrate the ability to distinguish symmetric inhomogeneity positions with
respect to the central conductor of the coplanar waveguide by the phase of
imbalance signal. The thin-film structure scanning procedure displays the
possibility of proposed approach to resolve low-contrast structures with
accuracy up to 98.7 %.

<h3>Revisiting the Lindemann's criterion from a minimal viscosity  perspective</h3>

<br>
<i>Pablo G. Tello, Sauro Succi</i>
<p>A revisiting of the Lindemann criterion under the recently established
minimal viscosity formulation is proposed which uncovers intriguing insights
into the melting process. The approach suggests that melting involves
competition between the electron rest energy and the thermal one caused by
temperature increase when considering a defect-free crystal structure. However,
when accounting for the role of vacancies in the melting process, the analysis
suggests that the key competing factors are the thermal energy and the one
needed for vacancy migration. The estimated value of the Lindemann constant, in
this case, is close to the reported values and with recent simulations studying
the correlation between Born and Lindemann melting criteria.

<p>We investigate electric-field effects in dilute electrolytes with nonlinear
polarization. As a first example of such systems, we add a dipolar component
with a relatively large dipole moment $\mu_0$ to an aqueous electrolyte. As a
second example, the solvent itself exhibits nonlinear polarization near charged
objects. For such systems, we present a Ginzburg-Landau free energy and
introduce field-dependent chemical potentials, entropy density, and stress
tensor, which satisfy general thermodynamic relations. In the first example,
the dipoles accumulate in high-field regions, as predicted by Abrashikin {\it
et al}.$[$Phys.Rev.Lett. {\bf 99}, 077801 (2007)$]$. Finally, we consider the
case, where Bjerrum ion pairs form a dipolar component with nonlinear
polarization. The Bjerrum dipoles accumulate in high-field regions, while
field-induced dissociation was predicted by Onsager $[$J. Chem. Phys.{\bf 2},
599 (1934)$]$. We present an expression for the field-dependent association
constant $K(E)$, which depends on the field strength nonmonotonically.

<h3>Ferroelectric topological superconductor</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaoming Zhang, Pei Zhao, Feng Liu</i>
<p>Two-dimensional topological superconductor (TSC) represents an exotic quantum
material with quasiparticle excitation manifesting in dispersive Majorana mode
(DMM) at the boundaries. A domain-wall DMM can arise at the boundary between
two TSC domains with opposite Chern numbers or with a $\pi$-phase shift in
their pairing gap, which can only be tuned by magnetic field. Here we propose
the concept of ferroelectric (FE) TSC, which not only enriches the domain-wall
DMMs but also significantly makes them electrically tunable. The $\pi$-phase
shift of the pairing gap is shown to be attained between two TSC domains of
opposite FE polarization, and switchable by reversing FE polarizations. In
combination with ferromagnetic (FM) polarization, the domain wall can host
helical, doubled chiral, and fused DMMs, which can be transferred into each
other by changing the direction of electrical and/or magnetic field.
Furthermore, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate
$\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ to be a promising FE TSC candidate in proximity with a FM
layer and a superconductor substrate. We envision that FE TSC will
significantly ease the manipulation of DMM by electrical field to realize
fault-tolerant quantum computation.

<h3>Pushing the Pareto front of band gap and permittivity: ML-guided search  for dielectric materials</h3>

<i>Janosh Riebesell, T. Wesley Surta, Rhys Goodall, Michael Gaultois, Alpha A Lee</i>
<p>Materials with high-dielectric constant easily polarize under external
electric fields, allowing them to perform essential functions in many modern
electronic devices. Their practical utility is determined by two conflicting
properties: high dielectric constants tend to occur in materials with narrow
band gaps, limiting the operating voltage before dielectric breakdown. We
present a high-throughput workflow that combines element substitution, ML
pre-screening, ab initio simulation and human expert intuition to efficiently
explore the vast space of unknown materials for potential dielectrics, leading
to the synthesis and characterization of two novel dielectric materials,
CsTaTeO6 and Bi2Zr2O7. Our key idea is to deploy ML in a multi-objective
optimization setting with concave Pareto front. While usually considered more
challenging than single-objective optimization, we argue and show preliminary
evidence that the $1/x$-correlation between band gap and permittivity in fact
makes the task more amenable to ML methods by allowing separate models for band
gap and permittivity to each operate in regions of good training support while
still predicting materials of exceptional merit. To our knowledge, this is the
first instance of successful ML-guided multi-objective materials optimization
achieving experimental synthesis and characterization. CsTaTeO6 is a structure
generated via element substitution not present in our reference data sources,
thus exemplifying successful de-novo materials design. Meanwhile, we report the
first high-purity synthesis and dielectric characterization of Bi2Zr2O7 with a
band gap of 2.27 eV and a permittivity of 20.5, meeting all target metrics of
our multi-objective search.

<h3>Should you hire new searchers? Optimal number of agents in a collective  search, and when to launch them</h3>

<br>
<i>Hugues Meyer, Heiko Rieger</i>
<p>Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively look for a
randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually
decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires
resources to create and sustain more agents. In this letter, we consider a
collective search cost that not only accounts for the search time but also for
the cost associated to the creation and the maintenance of an agent. We first
present a general formalism for independent agents in terms of the survival
probability of the target for a single-agent search s(t), where we allow agents
to be introduced in the system one after the other. From this, we first derive
analytically the optimal number of searchers to launch initially in the system.
Then, we identify the optimal strategies for exponential and algebraic
single-agent survival probabilities by pointing out the ideal times at which
new searchers should be launched in the system. Our results show that all
searchers should be launched simultaneously in the exponential case, while some
should be launched at later times in the algebraic case. Finally, we compare
these results with numerical simulations of a strongly interacting collective
search, the true self-avoiding walk, and show how the optimal strategy differ
from the non-interacting case.

<i>Willem Gispen, Marjolein Dijkstra</i>
<p>By employing brute-force molecular dynamics, umbrella sampling, and seeding
simulations, we investigate homogeneous nucleation during melting and freezing
of hard spheres. We provide insights into these opposing phase transitions from
the standpoint of classical nucleation theory. We observe that melting has both
a lower driving force and a lower interfacial tension than freezing. The lower
driving force arises from the vicinity of a spinodal instability in the solid
and from a strain energy. The lower interfacial tension implies that the Tolman
lengths associated with melting and freezing have opposite signs, a phenomenon
that we interpret with Turnbull's rule. Despite these asymmetries, the
nucleation rates for freezing and melting are found to be comparable.

<p>We use momentum-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy in transmission
to study collective charge excitations in the "strange" layer metal
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We cover a complete range between in-plane and out-of-plane
oscillations. Outside of the classical range of electron-hole excitations,
leading to a Landau damping, we observe well defined plasmons. The optical
(acoustic) plasmon due to an in-phase (out-of-phase) charge oscillation of
neighbouring layers exhibits a quadratic (linear) dispersion. Using a model for
the Coulomb interaction of the charges in a layered system, it is possible to
describe the complete range of plasmon excitations in a mean-field random phase
approximation without taking correlation effects into account. There are no
signs of over-damped plasmons predicted by holographic theories. This indicates
that long wavelength charge excitations are not influenced by local correlation
effects such as on-site Coulomb interaction and Hund's exchange interaction.

<p>The magnetic sublayers introduced by intercalation into the host
transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) are known to produce various magnetic
states. The magnetic sublayers and their magnetic ordering strongly modify the
electronic coupling between layers of the host compound. Understanding the
roots of this variability is a significant challenge. Here we employ the
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at various photon energies, the {\it
ab initio} electronic structure calculations, and modeling to address the
particular case of Ni-intercalate, Ni$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. We find that the bands
around the Fermi level bear the signature of a strong yet unusual hybridization
between NbS$_2$ conduction band states and the Ni 3$d$ orbitals. The
hybridization between metallic NbS$_2$ layers is almost entirely suppressed in
the central part of the Brillouin zone, including the part of the Fermi surface
around the $\mathrm{\Gamma}$ point. Simultaneously, it gets very pronounced
towards the zone edges. It is shown that this behavior is the consequence of
the rather exceptional, {\it symmetry imposed}, spatially strongly varying,
{\it zero total} hybridization between relevant Ni magnetic orbitals and the
neighboring Nb orbitals that constitute the metallic bands. We also report the
presence of the so-called $\beta$-feature, discovered only recently in two
other magnetic intercalates with very different magnetic orderings. In
Ni$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, the feature shows only at particular photon energies,
indicating its bulk origin. Common to prior observations, it appears as a
series of very shallow electron pockets at the Fermi level, positioned along
the edge of the Brillouin zone. Unforeseen by {\it ab initio} electronic
calculations, and its origin still unresolved, the feature appears to be a
robust consequence of the intercalation of 2H-NbS$_2$ with magnetic ions.

<i>Maciej Lewkowicz, Tomasz Karpiuk, Mariusz Gajda, Mirosław Brewczyk</i>
<p>We study a mixture of a dipolar condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas in a
quasi-one-dimensional geometry. We demonstrate that the presence of fermions
may drastically change the behavior of a dipolar condensate. For strong enough
boson-fermion attraction a dipolar Bose-Fermi droplet appears in the mixture
and a roton excitation develops in the Bogoliubov excitations spectrum. As
shown analytically and by solving numerically the coupled set of extended
Gross-Pitaevski and Hartree-Fock equations for bosonic and fermionic
components, respectively, roton instability mechanism leads to the formation of
supersolid phase in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Scaling arguments show that
although the dysprosium atoms are considered to demonstrate the appearance of
the supersolid phase, such a phase can be observed with less magnetic atoms
like chromium and even rubidium.

<i>Himanshu Sharma, Bhawna Sahni, Tanusri Saha-Dasgupta, Aftab Alam</i>
<p>Transition metal-based quaternary chalcogenides have gathered immense
attention for various renewable energy applications including thermoelectrics
(TE). While low-symmetry and complex structure help to achieve low thermal
conductivity, the TE power factor and hence the figure of merit (ZT) remains
low which hinders to promote these class of materials for future TE
applications. Here, we investigated the TE properties of a new system,
Cu$_2$ZnSiTe$_4$, with improved electronic transport using first-principles
calculation. The presence of heavy chalcogen like Te, helps to achieve a
relatively low bandgap (0.58 eV). This, together with unique electronic band
topology, leads to a promising value of power-factor of 3.95(n-type) and
3.06(p-type) mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 900 K. Te atoms also play a crucial role in
mixing the optical and acoustic phonon branches which, in turn, are responsible
for reduced lattice thermal conductivity ($\sim$0.7 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at high
temperature). Though the thermal conductivity is not appreciably low, the
electronic transport properties (power factor) are quite favorable to yield
promising TE figure of merit (ZT $\sim$2.67 (n-type) and $\sim$2.11 (p-type) at
900 K). We propose Cu$_2$ZnSiTe$_4$ to be a potential candidate for TE
applications, and believe to attract future experimental/theoretical studies.

<i>Zhen-Xia Niu</i>
<p>Driving a quantum many-body system across the quantum phase transition (QPT)
in finite time has been concerned in different branches of physics to explore
various fundamental questions. Here, we analyze how the underlying QPT affects
the work distribution, when the controlling parameter of a ferromagnetic spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates is tuned through the critical point in finite time.We
show that the work distribution undergoes a dramatic change with increasing the
driving time $\tau$, which is further captured by employing the entropy of the
work distribution.We observe three distinct regions in the evolution of entropy
as a function of $\tau$.Specifically, the entropy is insensitive to the driving
time in the region of very short $\tau$. However, in the region with
intermediate value of $\tau$, it exhibits a universal power-law decay
consistent with the well-known Kibble-Zurek mechanism. For the region with
large $\tau$, the validity of the adiabatic perturbation theory leads to the
entropy decay as $\tau^{-2}\ln\tau$. Our results verify the usefulness of the
entropy of the work distribution for understanding the critical dynamics and
provide an alternative way to experimentally study nonequilibrium properties in
quantum many-body systems.

<h3>Second Harmonic Generation from Ultracold Bosons in an Optical Cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05929</a>
<br>
<i>Megha Gopalakrishna, Emil Viñas Boström, Claudio Verdozzi</i>
<p>Within a cavity quantum electrodynamics description, we characterize the
fluorescent spectrum from ultracold bosons atoms, in the second harmonic
generation (SHG) and resonant cases. Two situations are considered: i) bosons
loaded into an optical lattice and ii) in a trapped two-component dilute
Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), in the regime where the Bogoliubov
approximation is often employed. Atom and photon degrees of freedom are treated
on equal footing within an exact time-dependent configuration interaction
scheme, and cavity leakage is included by including classical oscillator baths.
For optical lattices, we consider few bosons in short chains, described via the
Bose-Hubbard model with two levels per site, and we find that the spectral
response grows on increasing the number of atoms at weak interactions, but
diminishes at high interactions (if the number of chain sites does not exceed
the number of atoms), and is shifted to lower frequency. In the BEC regime, the
spectra display at noticeable extent a scaling behavior with the number of
particles and a suitable rescaling of the BEC-cavity and inter-particle
interactions, whilst the SHG spectrum redshifts at large atom-atom
correlations. Overall, our results provide some general trends for the
fluorescence from ultracold bosons in optical cavities, which can be of
reference to experimental studies and further theoretical work.

<h3>Structure and scaling of Kitaev chain across a quantum critical point in  real space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05954</a>
<br>
<i>Yan He, Chih-Chun Chien</i>
<p>The spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is applied to the Kitaev chain with
inhomogeneous pairing interactions that vanish in half of the lattice and
result in a quantum critical point separating the superfluid and normal-gas
phases in real space. The weakly-interacting BCS theory predicts scaling
behavior of the penetration of the pair wavefunction into the normal-gas region
different from conventional power-law results due to the non-analytic
dependence of the BCS order parameter on the interaction. The Bogoliubov-de
Gennes (BdG) equation produces numerical results confirming the scaling
behavior and hints complications in the strong-interaction regime. The limiting
case of the step-function quench shows the dominance of the BCS coherence
length in absence of additional length scale. Furthermore, the energy spectrum
and wavefunctions from the BdG equation show abundant in-gap states from the
normal-gas region in addition to the topological edge states.

<br>
<i>Christos Gatsios, Andreas Opitz, Dominique Lungwitz, Ahmed E. Mansour, Thorsten Schultz, Dongguen Shin, Sebastian Hammer, Jens Pflaum, Yadong Zhang, Stephen Barlow, Seth R. Marder, Norbert Koch</i>
<p>The surface molecular doping of organic semiconductors can play an important
role in the development of organic electronic or optoelectronic devices.
Single-crystal rubrene remains a leading molecular candidate for applications
in electronics due to its high hole mobility. In parallel, intensive research
into the fabrication of flexible organic electronics requires the careful
design of functional interfaces to enable optimal device characteristics. To
this end, the present work seeks to understand the effect of surface molecular
doping on the electronic band structure of rubrene single crystals. Our
angle-resolved photoemission measurements reveal that the Fermi level moves in
the band gap of rubrene depending on the direction of surface electron-transfer
reactions with the molecular dopants, yet the valence band dispersion remains
essentially unperturbed. This indicates that surface electron-transfer doping
of a molecular single crystal can effectively modify the near-surface charge
density, while retaining good charge-carrier mobility.

<p>We determine the impurity-induced free energy and the impurity-induced
zero-field susceptibility of the symmetric single-impurity Kondo model from
weak-coupling perturbation theory up to third order in the Kondo coupling at
low temperatures and small magnetic fields. We reproduce the analytical
structure of the zero-field magnetic susceptibility as obtained from Wilson's
renormalization group method. This permits us to obtain analytically the first

<h3>Understanding how off-stoichiometry promotes cation mixing in LiNiO$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05983" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05983</a>
<br>
<i>Cem Komurcuoglu, Yunhao Xiao, Xinhao Li, Joaquin Rodriguez-Lopez, Zheng Li, Alan C. West, Alexander Urban</i>
<p>Although LiNiO$_2$ is chemically similar to LiCoO$_2$ and offers a nearly
identical theoretical capacity, LiNiO$_2$ and related Co-free Ni-rich cathode
materials suffer from degradation during electrochemical cycling that has
prevented practical use in Li-ion batteries. The observed capacity decay of
LiNiO$_2$ has been attributed to the formation of structural defects via Li/Ni
cation mixing that reduces cyclability and leads to poor capacity retention.
Herein, we investigate the kinetics and thermodynamics of Li/Ni mixing in ideal
LiNiO$_2$ and off-stoichiometric Li$_{1-z}$Ni$_{1+z}$O$_2$. We find that ideal
LiNiO$_2$ is stable against cation mixing with similar characteristics as
LiCoO$_2$. Li/Ni mixing is promoted by extra Ni in the Li layers that cannot be
avoided in synthesis. Our study elucidates the crucial role of extra Ni atoms
on Li sites in the cation mixing mechanism, an insight that can inform the
development of Co-free cathode materials.

<h3>Voltage dependent first-principles barriers to Li transport within  Li-ion battery Solid-Electrolyte-Interphases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05988" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05988</a>
<br>
<i>Quinn T. Campbell</i>
<p>Charging a Li-ion battery requires Li ion transport between the cathode and
the anode. This Li-ion transport is dependent upon (among other factors) the
electrostatic environment the ion encounters within the
Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI), which separates the anode from the
surrounding electrolyte. Previous first principles work has illuminated the
reaction barriers through likely atomistic SEI environments, but has had
difficulty accurately reflecting the larger electrostatic potential landscape
that an ion encounters moving through the SEI. In this work, we apply the
recently developed Quantum Continuum Approximation (QCA) technique to provide
an equilibrium electronic potentiostat for first-principles interface
calculations. Using QCA, we calculate the potential barrier for Li-ion
transport through LiF, Li$_2$O, and Li$_2$CO$_3$ SEIs along with LiF-LiF, and
LiF-Li$_2$O grain boundaries, all paired with Li metal anodes. We demonstrate
that the SEI potential barrier is dependent on the anode electrochemical
potentials in each system. Furthermore, we find that the threshold potential at
which the SEI potential barrier switches from encouraging Li ion transport
toward the anode versus discouraging transport toward the anode is highly
dependent on the exact SEI chemistry. Finally, we use these techniques to
estimate the change in the diffusion barrier for a Li ion moving in a LiF SEI
as a function of anode potential.

<p>We report the discovery of a boundary-induced body-centered tetragonal (bct)
iron phase in thin films deposited on MgAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$ ($001$) substrates. We
present evidence for this phase using detailed x-ray analysis and ab-initio
density functional theory calculations. A lower magnetic moment and a rotation
of the easy magnetisation direction are observed, as compared to body-centered
cubic (bcc) iron. Our findings expand the range of known crystal and magnetic
phases of iron, providing valuable insights for the development of
heterostructure devices using ultra-thin iron layers.

<h3>Two-dimensional altermagnets from high throughput computational  screening: symmetry requirements, chiral magnons and spin-orbit effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05992" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05992</a>
<br>
<i>Joachim Sødequist, Thomas Olsen</i>
<p>We present a high throughput computational search for altermagnetism in
two-dimensional (2D) materials based on the Computational 2D Materials Database
(C2DB). We start by showing that the symmetry requirements for altermagnetism
in 2D are somewhat more strict compared to bulk materials and applying these
yields a total of 7 altermagnets in the C2DB. The collinear ground state in
these monolayers are verified by spin spiral calculations using the generalized
Bloch theorem. We focus on four $d$-wave altermagnetic materials belonging to
the $P2_1'/c'$ magnetic space group - RuF$_4$, VF$_4$, AgF$_2$ and OsF$_4$. The
first three of these are known experimentally as van der Waals bonded bulk
materials and are likely to be exfoliable from their bulk parent compounds. We
perform a detailed analysis of the electronic structure and non-relativistic
spin splitting in $k$-space exemplified by RuF$_4$. The magnon spectrum of
RuF$_4$ is calculated from the magnetic force theorem and it is shown that the
symmetries that enforce degenerate magnon bands in anti-ferromagnets are absent
in altermagnets and give rise to the obtained non-degenerate magnon spectrum.
We then include spin-orbit effects and show that these will dominate the
splitting ofmagnons in RuF$_4$. Finally, we provide an example of $i$-wave
altermagnetism in the 2H phase of FeBr$_3$.

<h3>Phase separation in ordered polar active fluids: A new Universality  class</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05996</a>
<br>
<i>Maxx Miller, John Toner</i>
<p>We show that phase separation in ordered polar active fluids belongs to a new
universality class. This describes large collections of self-propelled entities
(``flocks"), all spontaneously moving in the same direction, in which
attractive interactions (which can be caused by, e.g., autochemotaxis) cause
phase separation: the system spontaneously separates into a high density band
and a low density band, moving parallel to each other, and to the direction of
mean flock motion, at different speeds. The upper critical dimension for this
transition is $d_c=5$, in contrast to the well-known $d_c=4$ of equilibrium
phase separation. We obtain the large-distance, long-time scaling laws of the
velocity and density fluctuations, which are characterized by universal
critical correlation length and order parameter exponents $\nu_\perp$,
$\nu_\parallel$ and $\beta$ respectively. We calculate these to $\mathcal{O}
(\epsilon)$ in a $d=5-\epsilon$ expansion.

<h3>A first-principles study of Zn induced liquid metal embrittlement at bcc  and fcc grain boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05997" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05997</a>
<br>
<i>Ujjal Saikia, Mira Todorova, Tilmann Hickel</i>
<p>Zn induced liquid metal embrittlement (LME) is a major concern in particular
for advanced high strength steels, which often contain a significant amount of
austenite compared to established steel grades. Using density functional theory
(DFT) calculations we, therefore, compare the behaviour of Zn in ferrite (bcc)
and austenite (fcc) grain boundaries (GBs) with different magnetic ordering to
investigate the role of crystal structure as well as magnetism in LME. We
address the performance of DFT based paramagnetic calculations by utilizing the
spin space averaging relaxation approach. Our results show that both magnetic
and elastic contributions have significant influence towards segregation and
embrittling behaviour of Zn. The primary requirement is the elastic
contribution, while the presence of magnetic disorder increases the critical
concentrations for the onset of GB weakening. While Zn segregation is more
favourable in bcc compared to fcc GB, larger impact of Zn coverage on GB
weakening is observed for fcc. For both structures, the rapid decrease in
surface defect state energies is identified as the driving force behind GB
weakening. These surface defect states stabilize at lower Zn concentrations
than GB defect states.

<h3>Orbital hall effect: from intrinsic mechanism to experimental evidence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06012</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Li</i>
<p>Comparing with the spin of electron, the electronic orbitals, which have been
long ignored in non-equilibrium transport, are getting more and more
attentions, due to the prediction and experimental verification of orbital Hall
effect (OHE) recently. In this report, the recent advances, including intrinsic
mechanisms, direct and indirect experimental observations of OHE, are reviewed
comprehensively. The orbital current, generated by OHE, shows much more
fundamental features than spin current in explaining Hall conductivity and
manipulating magnetization electronically. Theoretically, in momentum space,
the OHE is proposed to originate from electric-field driven non-equilibrium
orbital texture, based on tight-binding model. However, current experimental
works still stay on the level to reveal how the OHE behaves after orbital
current is generated, and the unambiguous experimental evidence to verify the
generation mechanism of OHE is still missing, limiting the interpretation of
OHE. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with polarized incident photon,
on the other hand, could be used to identify the orbital textures on energy
band and reveal the non-equilibrium nature of orbital-momentum locking behind
OHE, which may help to provide the direct experimental evidence to examine the
intrinsic mechanism of OHE, and reveal the nature of wave packet with
non-vanishing orbital angular momentum.

<h3>Electron-vacancy scattering in SrNbO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$: A DFT-NEGF study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06039" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06039</a>
<br>
<i>Victor Rosendal, Nini Pryds, Dirch Hjorth Petersen, Mads Brandbyge</i>
<p>Oxygen vacancies are often attributed to changes in the electronic transport
for perovskite oxide materials (ABO$_3$). Here, we use density functional
theory (DFT) coupled with non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) to
systematically investigate the influence of O vacancies and also A and B-site
vacancies, on the electronic transport as characterised by a scattering
cross-section. We consider SrNbO$_3$ and n-type SrTiO$_3$ and contrast results
for bulk and thin film (slab) geometries. By varying the electron doping in
SrTiO$_3$ we get insight into how the electron-vacancy scattering vary for
different experimental conditions. We observe a significant increase in the
scattering cross-section (in units of square-lattice parameter, $a^2$) from ca.
$0.5-2.5a^2$ per vacancy in SrNbO$_3$ and heavily doped SrTiO$_3$ to more than
$9a^2$ in SrTiO$_3$ with 0.02 free carriers per unit cell. Furthermore, the
scattering strength of O vacancies is enhanced in TiO$_2$ terminated surfaces
by more than 6 times in lowly doped SrTiO$_3$ compared to other locations in
slabs and bulk systems. Interestingly, we also find that Sr vacancies go from
being negligible scattering centers in SrNbO$_3$ and heavily doped SrTiO$_3$,
to having a large scattering cross-section in weakly doped SrTiO$_3$. We
therefore conclude that the electron-vacancy scattering in these systems is
sensitive to the combination of electron concentration and vacancy location.

<p>Using machine learning with a variational formula for diffusivity, we recast
diffusion as a sum of individual contributions to diffusion--called
"kinosons"--and compute their statistical distribution to model a complex
multicomponent alloy. Calculating kinosons is orders of magnitude more
efficient than computing whole trajectories, and elucidates kinetic mechanisms
for diffusion. The distribution of kinosons with temperature leads to new
accurate analytic models for macroscale diffusivity. This combination of
machine learning with diffusion theory promises insight into other complex
materials.

occurring in confined fermionic superfluids. We analyze several thermodynamic
properties, such as the chemical potential, the energy gap and the superfluid

<br>
<i>G. S. Diniz, E. Vernek</i>
<p>We have studied the Kondo effect of a spin-1/2 impurity coupled to a
two-dimensional altermagnet host material. To attain the low-temperature
many-body Kondo physics of the system, we have performed a numerical
renormalization group calculations that allows us to access the spectral
properties of the system at zero temperature. The impurity spectral function
and the Kondo temperature were calculated for different set of parameters,
including Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and an external magnetic field.
Interestingly, in the RSOC and altermagnetic fields, the hybridization function
is spin independent, despite the characteristic broken time-reversal symmetry
(TRS) of the altermagnet. This is because the alternating sign of the spin
splitting of the bands in the momentum space renders equal contributions for
both spin components of the hybridization function. Our results demonstrate
that, although the hybridization function is TR symmetric, the Kondo
temperature is substantially suppressed by the altermagnet coupling. Moreover,
we have investigated the effect of an external magnetic field applied in the
altermagnet along different directions. Interestingly, we observe an important
restraining of the Kondo peak which depends strongly on the direction of the
field. This anisotropic effect is, however, masked if strong Zeeman splitting
takes place at the impurity, as it shatter the Kondo-singlet state.

<h3>Signature of anyonic statistics in the integer quantum Hall regime</h3>

<p>Anyons are exotic low-dimensional quasiparticles whose unconventional quantum
statistics extends the binary particle division into fermions and bosons. The
fractional quantum Hall regime provides a natural host, with first convincing
anyon signatures recently observed through interferometry and
cross-correlations of colliding beams. However, the fractional regime is rife
with experimental complications, such as an anomalous tunneling density of
states, which impede the manipulation of anyons. Here we show experimentally
that the canonical integer quantum Hall regime can provide a robust anyon
platform. Exploiting the Coulomb interaction between two co-propagating quantum
Hall channels, an electron injected into one channel splits into two fractional
charges behaving as abelian anyons. Their unconventional statistics is revealed
by negative cross-correlations between dilute quasiparticle beams. Similarly to
fractional quantum Hall observations, we show that the negative signal stems
from a time-domain braiding process, here involving the incident fractional
quasiparticles and spontaneously generated electron-hole pairs. Beyond the
dilute limit, a theoretical understanding is achieved via the edge
magnetoplasmon description of interacting integer quantum Hall channels. Our
findings establish that, counter-intuitively, the integer quantum Hall regime
provides a platform of choice for exploring and manipulating quasiparticles
with fractional quantum statistics.

<h3>Peridynamic Neural Operators: A Data-Driven Nonlocal Constitutive Model  for Complex Material Responses</h3>

<br>
<i>Siavash Jafarzadeh, Stewart Silling, Ning Liu, Zhongqiang Zhang, Yue Yu</i>
<p>Neural operators, which can act as implicit solution operators of hidden
governing equations, have recently become popular tools for learning the
responses of complex real-world physical systems. Nevertheless, most neural
operator applications have thus far been data-driven and neglect the intrinsic
preservation of fundamental physical laws in data. In this work, we introduce a
novel integral neural operator architecture called the Peridynamic Neural
Operator (PNO) that learns a nonlocal constitutive law from data. This neural
operator provides a forward model in the form of state-based peridynamics, with
objectivity and momentum balance laws automatically guaranteed. As
applications, we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in
learning complex material behaviors from both synthetic and experimental data
sets. We show that, owing to its ability to capture complex responses, our
learned neural operator achieves improved accuracy and efficiency compared to
baseline models that use predefined constitutive laws. Moreover, by preserving
the essential physical laws within the neural network architecture, the PNO is
robust in treating noisy data. The method shows generalizability to different
domain configurations, external loadings, and discretizations.

<p>The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases
$^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or
heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell
construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation
mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes
may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase
transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for
the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the
Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for
probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a
novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically
smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and
assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is
used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in
them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous
nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by
ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary
measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and
superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase
transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a
function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both
better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel
intrinsic mechanisms.

<h3>2D Li$^{\bf +}$ ionic hopping in Li$_{\bf 3}$InCl$_{\bf 6}$ as revealed  by diffusion-induced nuclear spin relaxation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06090</a>

<i>Florian Stainer, H. Martin R. Wilkening</i>
<p>Ternary Li halides, such as Li$_3$MeX$_6$ with, e.g., Me = In, Sc, Y and X =
Cl, Br, are in the center of attention for battery applications as these
materials might serve as ionic electrolytes. To fulfill their function, such
electrolytes must have an extraordinarily high ionic Li$^+$ conductivity.
Layer-structured Li$_3$InCl$_6$ represents such a candidate; understanding the
origin of the rapid Li$^+$ exchange processes needs, however, further
investigation. Spatially restricted, that is, low-dimensional particle
diffusion might offer an explanation for fast ion dynamics. It is, however,
challenging to provide evidence for 2D diffusion at the atomic scale when
dealing with polycrystalline powder samples. Here, we used purely
diffusion-induced $^7$Li nuclear magnetic spin relaxation to detect anomalies
that unambiguously show that 2D Li diffusion is chiefly responsible for the
dynamic processes in a Li$_3$InCl$_6$ powder sample. The change of the
spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ as a function of inverse temperature $1/T$
passes through a rate peak that is strictly following asymmetric behavior. This
feature is in excellent agreement with the model of P. M. Richards suggesting a
logarithmic spectral density function $J$ to fully describe 2D diffusion.
Hence, Li$_3$InCl$_6$ belongs to the very rare examples for which 2D Li$^+$
diffusion has been immaculately verified. We believe that such information help
understand the dynamic features of ternary Li halides.

<p>The chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS$_3$ has strong visible light absorption and
high chemical stability, is nontoxic, and is made from earth-abundant elements.
As such, it is a promising candidate material for application in optoelectronic
technologies. However the synthesis of BaZrS$_3$ thin-films for

density functional theory and lattice dynamics to calculate the vibrational
properties of elemental, binary and ternary materials in the Ba-Zr-S system.
This is used to build a thermodynamic model for the stability of BaZrS$_3$,
BaS$_x$, and ZrS$_x$ in equilibrium with sulfur gas, across a range of
temperatures and sulfur partial pressures. We highlight that reaction
thermodynamics are highly sensitive to sulfur allotrope and the extent of
allotrope mixing. We use our model to predict the synthesis conditions in which
BaZrS$_3$ and the intermediate compound BaS$_3$, which is associated with fast
reaction kinetics, can form. At a moderate temperature of 500C we find that
BaS$_3$ is stable at pressures above 3x10$^5$ Pa. We also find BaZrS$_3$ is
stable against decomposition into sulfur-rich binaries up to at least 1x10$^7$
Pa. Our work provides insights into the chemistry of this promising material
and suggests the experimental conditions required for the successful synthesis
of BaZrS$_3$.

<p>Solution-phase bottom up self-assembly of nanocrystals into superstructures
such as ordered superlattices is an attractive strategy to generate functional
materials of increasing complexity, including very recent advances that
incorporate strong interparticle electronic coupling. While the self-assembly
kinetics in these systems have been elucidated and related to the product
characteristics, the weak interparticle bonding interactions suggest the
superstructures formed could continue to order within the solution long after
the primary nucleation and growth have occurred, even though the mechanism of
annealing remains to be elucidated. Here, we use a combination of Bragg
coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to
create real-space maps of supercrystalline order along with a real-time view of
the strain fluctuations in aging strongly coupled nanocrystal superlattices
while they remain suspended and immobilized in solution. By combining the
results, we deduce that the self-assembled superstructures are polycrystalline,
initially comprising multiple nucleation sites, and that shear avalanches at
grain boundaries continue to increase crystallinity long after growth has
substantially slowed. This multimodal approach should be generalizable to
characterize a breadth of materials in situ in their native chemical
environments, thus extending the reach of high-resolution coherent X-ray
characterization to the benefit of a much wider range of physical systems.

<h3>Phase Transition and Magneto-caloric Properties of Perovskites  Pr$_{0.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$MnO$_{3}$: Modeling versus Experiments</h3>

<p>Experimental data obtained with the perovskite compounds
Pr$_{0.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$MnO$_{3}$ show that the magnetization decreases with
increasing temperature $T$ and undergoes a very sharp phase transition to the
paramagnetic phase. The sharp transition in a system with a strong disorder is
very rare, if not non-existent, in the theory of phase transition in systems of
short-range pairwise exchange interactions. To understand this remarkable
property, we introduce a model including a multispin (cluster-like) interaction
between Mn ions, in addition to the usual pairwise exchange terms between these
ions and the Mn-Pr interactions. We carry out Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Due
to the doping, Mn$^{4+}$ with $S=3/2$ has the concentration of Pr$^{3+}$
($S=1$) and Mn$^{3+}$ with $S=2$ has the Sr concentration. After attempts with
different spin models and various Hamiltonians, we find that the many-state
Ising spin model reproduces most of the experimental results. For the
Hamiltonian, we find that pairwise interactions alone between ions cannot
reproduce the sharp transition and the magnetization below $T_C$. We have to
include a multispin interaction as said above. We fit the MC results with
experimental data, and we estimate values of various exchange interactions in
the system. These values are found to be in the range of those found in
perovskite manganite compounts. We also study the applied-field effect on the
magnetization in the temperature region below and above the transition
temperature $T_C$. We calculate the magnetic entropy change $|\Delta S_m|$ and
the Relative Cooling Power, for magnetic field from 1 to 3 Tesla. Our
simulation results are in good agreement with experiments.
