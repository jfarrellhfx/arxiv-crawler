<h3>The BHL-BCL crossover: from nonlinear to linear quantum amplification</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05458</a>

The black-hole laser (BHL) effect is the self-amplification of Hawking
radiation in the presence of a pair of horizons which act as a resonant cavity.
Its clear observation still remains a major challenge in the analogue gravity
field. In a flowing atomic condensate, the BHL effect arises in a finite
supersonic region, where Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau (BCL) radiation is
resonantly excited by any static perturbation. Thus, any experimental attempt
to produce a BHL will deal with the presence of a BCL background, as already
observed in experiments. Here, we perform a theoretical study of the BHL-BCL
crossover using an idealized model where both phenomena can be unambiguously
isolated. By drawing an analogy with an unstable pendulum, we distinguish three
main regimes according to the interplay between quantum fluctuations and
classical stimulation: quantum BHL, classical BHL, and BCL. Based on quite
general scaling arguments, the nonlinear amplification of quantum fluctuations
until saturation is identified as the most robust trait of a quantum BHL. A
classical BHL behaves instead as a linear quantum amplifier, where the output
is proportional to the input. Finally, the BCL regime also acts as a linear
quantum amplifier, but its gain is exponentially smaller as compared to a
classical BHL. The results of this work not only are of interest for analogue
gravity, where they help to distinguish unambiguously each phenomenon and to
design experimental schemes for a clear observation of the BHL effect, but they
also open the prospect of finding applications of analogue concepts in quantum
technologies.

<h3>Quantum criticality and entanglement for 2d long-range Heisenberg  bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05465" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05465</a>

The study of quantum criticality and entanglement in systems with long-range
(LR) interactions is still in its early stages, with many open questions
remaining. In this work, we investigate critical exponents and scaling of
entanglement entropies (EE) in the LR bilayer Heisenberg model using
large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and the recently developed
nonequilibrium increment algorithm for measuring EE. By applying modified
(standard) finite-size scaling (FSS) above (below) the upper critical dimension
and field theory analysis, we obtain precise critical exponents in three
regimes: the LR Gaussian regime with a Gaussian fixed point, the short-range
(SR) regime with Wilson-Fisher (WF) exponents, and a LR non-Gaussian regime
where the critical exponents vary continuously from LR Gaussian to SR values.
We compute the R\'enyi EE both along the critical line and in the N\'eel phase
and observe that as the LR interaction is enhanced, the area-law contribution
in EE gradually vanishes both at quantum critical points (QCPs) and in the
N\'eel phase. The log-correction in EE arising from sharp corners at the QCPs
also decays to zero as LR interaction grows, whereas the log-correction for
N\'eel states, caused by the interplay of Goldstone modes and restoration of
the symmetry in a finite system, is enhanced as LR interaction becomes
stronger. We also discuss relevant experimental settings to detect these
nontrivial properties in critical behavior and entanglement information for
quantum many-body systems with LR interactions.

Superconducting qubits with intrinsic noise protection offer a promising
approach to improve the coherence of quantum information. Crucial to such
protected qubits is the encoding of the logical quantum states into
wavefunctions with disjoint support. Such encoding can be achieved by a
Josephson element with an unusual charge-4e supercurrent emerging from the
coherent transfer of pairs of Cooper-pairs. In this work, we demonstrate the
controlled conversion of a conventional charge-2e dominated to a charge-4e
dominated supercurrent in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
consisting of gate-tunable planar Josephson junctions (JJs). We investigate the
ac Josephson effect of the SQUID and measure a dominant photon emission at
twice the fundamental Josephson frequency together with a doubling of the
number of Shapiro steps, both consistent with the appearance of charge-4e
supercurrent. Our results present a step towards novel protected
superconducting qubits based on superconductor-semiconductor hybrid materials.

<h3>Doping dependence of chiral superconductivity in near $45^\circ$ twisted  bilayer cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05485</a>
<br>
<i>Mathieu Bélanger, David Sénéchal</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a one-band Hubbard model for a twisted cuprate bilayer with a twist
angle of 43.6$^\circ$ and a moire cell containing 58 sites. We use the
variational cluster approximation (VCA), which treats short-range correlations
exactly and leads, in single layers, to a dome of $d$-wave superconductivity
away from half-filling from strong on-site repulsion alone. We find a
time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking phase in a small doping interval in the
overdoped region when interlayer tunneling is strong enough. Contrary to
expectations, being closer to the $45^{\circ}$ twist angle does not expand this
TRS region compared to a previous study [Phys. Rev. B 105, 245127 (2022)] on a
$53^{\circ}$ twist angle. This is attributed to the fact that the two
superconducting states in competition have almost identical nodal structures.

<h3>The Hidden Hydroxide in BaNiO3 Single Crystals Grown from a KOH Flux</h3>

<br>
Hexagonal oxide perovskites with one-dimensional chains of face-sharing MO6
octahedra are of enduring interest. Specifically, the hexagonal perovskite
BaNiO3, prepared via non-ceramic approaches, acts as a highly functional
catalyst for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, with
numerous studies focusing on this behavior, while its fundamental structural
and physical properties have been somewhat overlooked. The current work is
intiated by the observation of contrasting magnetic properties of BaNiO3
synthesized via KOH flux growth and high O2 pressure ceramic synthesis. To shed
light on this difference, we have performed a series of rigorous analyses and
found that the KOH flux-grown crystals made in open-air are actually a wet form
of BaNiO3 that can be dried upon annealing in O2 flow but will then slowly
degrade if stored under a condition where the O2 partial pressure is not high
enough. Therefore, the present work not only provides insightful information to
unveil a previously unknown aspect of the OER catalyst BaNiO3, but also rings a
bell that the hidden hydroxide principle described here may also be applied to
other hexagonal perovskite oxides prepared in wet conditions.

<h3>Crucial role of thermal fluctuations and vertex corrections for the  magnetic pseudogap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05489" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05489</a>
<br>
<i>Mengxing Ye, Andrey V. Chubukov</i>
<br>
<br>
It is generally believed that in a metal, whose ground state is
antiferromagnetically ordered with ${\bf Q} = (\pi,\pi)$, thermal (static)
magnetic fluctuations give rise to precursor behavior above $T_N$, in which the
spectral function of a hot fermion (the one for which ${\bf k}$ and ${\bf k} +
{\bf Q}$ are Fermi surface points) contains two peaks, separated by roughly the
same energy as in the antiferromagnetically ordered state. The two peaks
persist in some range of $T >T_N$ and eventually merge into a single peak at
zero frequency. This behavior is obtained theoretically by departing from free
fermions in a paramagnet and evaluating the dressed fermionic Green's function
by summing up infinite series of diagrams with contributions from thermal
magnetic fluctuations. We show, following [Y.M. Vilk and A.-M. S. Tremblay, J.
Phys. I France ${\bf 7}$ 1309 (1997)] that keeping vertex renormalization
diagrams in these series is crucial as other terms only broaden the spectral
function of a hot fermion, but do not shift its maximum away from zero
frequency. As the consequence, magnetic pseudogap should be treated as an input
for theories that neglect vertex corrections, like, e.g., Eliashberg theory for
magnetically-mediated superconductivity. We also analyze potential pseudogap
behavior at $T=0$. We argue that it may exist, but only at a finite correlation
length, and not as a precursor to antiferromagnetism.

<h3>Mean-field models for the chemical fueling of transient soft matter  states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05504</a>
<br>
<i>Sven Pattloch, Joachim Dzubiella</i>
<br>
<br>
The chemical fueling of transient states (CFTS) is a powerful process to
control the nonequilibrium structuring and the homeostatic function of adaptive
soft matter systems. Here, we introduce a mean-field model of CFTS based on the
activation of metastable equilibrium states in a tilted Landau bistable energy
landscape along a coarse-grained reaction coordinate (or order parameter)
triggered by a nonmonotonic two-step chemical fueling reaction. Evaluation of
the model in the quasi-static (QS) limit - valid for fast system relaxation -
allows us to extract useful analytical laws for the critical activation
concentration and duration of the transient states in dependence of physical
parameters, such as rate constants, fuel concentrations, and the system's
distance to its equilibrium transition point. We apply our model in the QS
limit to recent experiments of CFTS of collapsing responsive microgels and find
a very good performance with only a few global and physically interpretable
fitting parameters, which can be employed for programmable material design.
Moreover, our model framework also allows a thermodynamic analysis of the
energy and performed work in the system. Finally, we go beyond the QS limit,
where the system's response is slow and retarded versus the chemical reaction,
using an overdamped Smoluchowski approach. The latter demonstrates how internal
system time scales can be used to tune the time-dependent behavior and
programmed delay of the transient states in full nonequilibrium.

<h3>Mapping domain junctions using 4D-STEM: toward controlled properties of  epitaxially grown transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Epitaxial growth has become a promising route to achieve highly crystalline
continuous two-dimensional layers. However, high-quality layer production with
expected electrical properties is still challenging due to the defects induced
by the coalescence between imperfectly aligned domains. In order to control
their intrinsic properties at the device scale, the synthesized materials
should be described as a patchwork of coalesced domains. Here, we report
multi-scale and multistructural analysis on highly oriented epitaxial WS$_2$
and WSe$_2$ monolayers using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
techniques. Characteristic domain junctions are first identified and classified
based on the detailed atomic structure analysis using aberration corrected STEM
imaging. Mapping orientation, polar direction and phase at the micrometer scale
using four-dimensional STEM enabled to access the density and the distribution
of the specific domain junctions. Our results validate a readily applicable
process for the study of highly oriented epitaxial transition metal
dichalcogenides, providing an overview of synthesized materials from large
scale down to atomic scale with multiple structural information.

<h3>Non-polaritonic effects in cavity-modified photochemistry</h3>

<br>
Strong coupling of molecules to vacuum fields has been widely reported to
lead to modified chemical properties such as reaction rates. However, some
recent attempts to reproduce infrared strong coupling results have not been
successful, suggesting that factors other than strong coupling may sometimes be
involved. Here we re-examine the first of these vacuum-modified chemistry
experiments, in which changes to a molecular photoisomerisation process were
attributed to strong coupling of the molecules to visible light. We observed
significant variations in photoisomerisation rates for molecules placed in a
variety of optical cavity structures, but found no evidence that these changes
need to be attributed to strong coupling. Instead, we suggest that the
photoisomerisation rates involved are most strongly influenced by the
absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the cavity. Our results indicate that
care must be taken to rule out non-polaritonic effects before invoking strong
coupling to explain any changes of chemical properties arising in cavity-based
experiments.

<h3>"Universal" $Δ_{max}/T_c$ in Fe Based Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05512" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05512</a>
<br>
<i>Siddhant Panda, P. J. Hirschfeld</i>
<br>
<br>
Iron-based superconductors display a large degree of variability in
electronic structure at the Fermi surface, resulting in superconducting gap
structures,$T_c$'s, and other properties that vary considerably from family to
family. Recently it was noted that across many different families of Fe-based
systems, the ratio $\Delta_{max}/T_c$ is found to be quasi-universal with a
large value of ~3.5 compared to the the one-band BCS weak-coupling result of
1.76. Here $\Delta_{max}$ is the measured maximum gap across the Fermi surface.
This remarkable fact was attributed to strong-coupling effects arising from
Hund's metal physics. Here we perform a "high-throughput" scan across band
masses, Fermi energies, and interaction parameters in a weak-coupling
Suhl-Matthias-Walker model. We find that unexpectedly large values of
$\Delta_{max}/T_c$ can be achieved within weak coupling, and that
quasiuniversal behavior similar to experiment emerges for those systems where
interband interactions dominate intraband ones. However, within the current
framework, a large mass contrast between bands is required.

<h3>Site percolation in distorted square and simple cubic lattices with  flexible number of neighbors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05513" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05513</a>
<br>
<i>Sayantan Mitra, Ankur Sensharma</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper exhibits a Monte Carlo study on site percolation using the
Newmann-Ziff algorithm in distorted square and simple cubic lattices where each
site is allowed to be directly linked with any other site if the euclidean
separation between the pair is at most a certain distance d, called the
connection threshold. Distorted lattices are formed from regular lattices by a
random but controlled dislocation of the sites with the help of a parameter
{\alpha}, called the distortion parameter. The distinctive feature of this
study is the relaxation of the restriction of forming bonds with only the
nearest neighbors. Owing to this flexibility and the intricate interplay
between the two parameters {\alpha} and d, the site percolation threshold may
either increase or decrease with distortion. The dependence of the percolation
threshold on the average degree of a site has been explored to show that the
obtained results are consistent with those on percolation in regular lattices
with extended neighborhood and continuum percolation.

<h3>Strain-stiffening elastomers fail from the edge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05575</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The accurate measurement of fracture resistance in elastomers is essential
for predicting the mechanical limits of soft devices. Usually, this is achieved
by performing tearing or peeling experiments on thin-sheet samples. Here, we
show that these tests can be surprisingly thickness-dependent, with thicker
samples being significantly stronger than thinner ones. Even for a simple
geometry, direct imaging of the fracture surface shows that the fracture
process actually involves three distinct cracks: an inner crack, and two edge
cracks. Ultimately, samples fail when two edge cracks meet at the sample's
mid-plane. The opening angle of edge crack, $2 \theta$, determines how far the
sample has to be stretched before the edge cracks meet. Conveniently, $\theta$
is a material property that can be inferred from the elastomer's non-linear
elastic response. To yield thickness-independent fracture-test results, sample
thickness should be much smaller than the smallest lateral sample dimension
divided by $\tan \theta$. Our results have direct implications for
characterizing, understanding, and modelling fracture in soft elastomers.

<h3>Proposal for realizing quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya  interaction using Rydberg atoms</h3>

<br>
<i>Masaya Kunimi, Takafumi Tomita, Hosho Katsura, Yusuke Kato</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a method to realize tunable quantum spin models with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our
scheme uses a two-photon Raman transition and transformation to the
spin-rotating frame. We investigate the quantum dynamics of the model including
only the DMI and Zeeman energy, which can be experimentally realized in our
scheme. Unlike its classical counterpart, the magnetization curve in this model
is continuous under the open boundary condition. We also show that the model
accommodates quantum many-body scars exhibiting nonergodic dynamics.

<h3>Twofold topological phase transitions induced by third-nearest-neighbor  interactions in 1D chains</h3>

<br>
<i>Yonatan Betancur-Ocampo, B. Manjarrez-Montañez, A.M. Martínez-Argüello, Rafael A. Méndez-Sánchez</i>
<br>
<br>
Strong long-range interactions up to third nearest neighbors may induce a
topological phase transition in one-dimensional chains. Unlike the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, this transition from trivial to topological phase
occurs with the emergence of a pseudospin valley structure and a twofold
nontrivial topological phase. Within a tight-binding approach, these
topological phases are analyzed in detail and it is shown that the low-energy
excitations follow a modified Dirac equation. An experimental realization in a
one-dimensional elastic chain, where it is feasible to tune directly the
third-nearest-neighbor interaction strength, is proposed.

<h3>Application of zero-determinant strategies to particle control in  statistical physics</h3>

Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which
unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much
attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of
evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of
zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant
strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and
communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we provide another
example of application of zero-determinant strategies: control of a particle on
a lattice. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be
implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove
that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a
zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These two results
enable us to apply the concept of zero-determinant strategies to control the
expected potential energies of two coordinates of a particle on a
two-dimensional lattice.

<h3>Reversible Actuation of $α$-Borophene Nanoscrolls</h3>

In this work, we proposed and investigated the structural and electronic
properties of boron-based nanoscrolls (armchair and zigzag) using the DFTB+
method. We also investigated the electroactuation process (injecting and
removing charges). A giant electroactuation was observed, but the results show
relevant differences between the borophene and carbon nanoscrolls. The
molecular dynamics simulations showed that the scrolls are thermally and
structurally stable for a large range of temperatures (up to 600K) and the
electroactuation process can be easily tuned and can be entirely reversible for
some configurations.

<br>
<br>
Topological insulators (TI) can apply highly efficient spin-orbit torque
(SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface
states, and their magnetic counterparts, magnetic topological insulators (MTI)
offer magnetization without shunting and are one of the highest in SOT
efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V-doped
(Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST) with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence
of an external magnetic field and a small magnetization to minimize stray
field. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 $k\Omega$ is realized,
among the largest of all SOT systems. The SOT switching current density can be
reduced to $2.8\times10^5 A/cm^2$, and the switching ratio can be enhanced to
60%. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both
gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from
edge-state-mediated to surface-state-mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT
effective field to $1.56\pm 0.12 T/ (10^6 A/cm^2)$ and the spin Hall angle to
$23.2\pm 1.8$ at 5 K. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate
for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices.

<h3>Coexistence of surface oxygen vacancy and interface conducting states in  LaAlO3/SrTiO3 revealed by low-angle resonant soft X-ray scattering</h3>

Oxide heterostructures have shown rich physics phenomena, particularly in the
conjunction of exotic insulator-metal transition (IMT) at the interface between
polar insulator LaAlO3 and non-polar insulator SrTiO3 (LaAlO3/SrTiO3).
Polarization catastrophe model has suggested an electronic reconstruction
yielding to metallicity at both the interface and surface. Another scenario is
the occurrence of surface oxygen vacancy at LaAlO3 (surface-Ov), which has
predicted surface-to-interface charge transfer yielding metallic interface but
insulating surface. To clarify the origin of IMT, one should probe surface-Ov
and the associated electronic structures at both the surface and the buried
interface simultaneously. Here, using low-angle resonant soft X-ray scattering
(LA-RSXS) supported with first-principles calculations, we reveal the
co-existence of the surface-Ov state and the interface conducting state only in
conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (001) films. Interestingly, both the surface-Ov state
and the interface conducting state are absent for the insulating film. As a
function of Ov density, while the surface-Ov state is responsible for the IMT,
the spatial charge distribution is found responsible for a transition from
two-dimensional-like to three-dimensional-like conducting accompanied by
spectral weight transfer, revealing the importance of electronic correlation.
Our results show the importance of surface-Ov in determining interface
properties and provides a new strategy in utilizing LA-RSXS to directly probe
the surface and buried interface electronic properties in complex oxide
heterostructures.

<br>
We describe the existence of local distortion discovered in the synchrotron
x-ray single-crystal structure analysis of layered ditelluride 1T-MTe2 (M = V,
Nb, Ta). In 1T-TaTe2, the double zigzag chain structure of Ta is deformed at
about 170 K, and heptamer molecules are formed periodically at low
temperatures. We found that some of the Ta atoms that compose the double zigzag
chain structure appearing at high temperatures are locally displaced, resulting
in local dimerization. This tendency weakens when Ta is replaced by V or Nb.
Our results indicate that the local distortion persistently survives in these
ditellurides, where the electronic degrees of freedom, including orbitals, are
weakened. We further discuss the origin of local distortion in these
ditellurides, which is different from many usual material systems where
molecular formation occurs at low temperatures.

Two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the simplest line-graph lattice, has

realization of the checkerboard lattice in monolayer Cu$_2$N. Experimentally,
monolayer Cu$_2$N can be realized in the well-known N/Cu(100) and N/Cu(111)
systems that were previously mistakenly believed to be insulators. Combined
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, first-principles
calculations, and tight-binding analysis show that both systems host
checkerboard-derived hole pockets near the Fermi level. In addition, monolayer
Cu$_2$N has outstanding stability in air and organic solvents, which is crucial

Violet phosphorus (VP), the most stable phosphorus allotrope, is a van der
Waals semiconductor that can be used to construct $\textit{p}$-type
nanodevices. Recently, high-quality VP crystals have been synthesized while a
deep insight into their excitonic properties and bandgap tailoring approaches,
which are crucial for their optoelectronic device applications, is still
lacking. Here, we study the optical properties of ultrathin VP by second
harmonic generation, photoluminescence, and optical absorption spectroscopy. We
observed strong bound exciton emission that is 0.48 eV away from the free
exciton emission, which is among the largest in 2D materials. In addition, the
bandgaps of VP are highly sensitive to the number of layers and external
strain, which provides convenient approaches for bandgap engineering. The
strong bound exciton emission and tunable bandgaps make VP a promising material
in optoelectronic devices.

We consider active Brownian particles switching between run and stop states.
Such intermittent dynamics are ubiquitous at all scales, from bacteria to
animals and in artificial active systems. We provide exact solutions for their
transport properties, e.g., velocity autocorrelations and diffusion
coefficients. The spread of particles depends on minute details, such as if the
memory of active orientation is retained across a stop event. We predict
dynamic schemes maximizing the effective diffusivity, potentially utilized by
active agents for better access to distributed food.

We present a novel finite-temperature second-order perturbation method
incorporating spin-orbit coupling to investigate the temperature-dependent
site-resolved contributions to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE),
specifically K1(T), in FePt, MnAl, and FeNi alloys. Our developed method
successfully reproduces the results obtained using the force theorem from our
previous work. By employing this method, we identify the key sites responsible
for the distinctive behaviors of MAE in these alloys, shedding light on the
inadequacy of the spin model in capturing the temperature dependence of MAE in
itinerant magnets. Moreover, we explore the lattice expansion effect on the
temperature dependence of on-site contributions to K1(T) in FeNi. Our results
not only provide insights into the limitations of the spin model in explaining
the temperature dependence of MAE in itinerant ferromagnets but also highlight
the need for further investigations. These findings contribute to a deeper
understanding of the complex nature of MAE in itinerant magnetic systems.

<br>
<br>
Dendritic microstructures are frequently observed in as-solidified refractory
high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), and their homogenization typically requires a
long-term heat treatment at extremely high temperatures. High-pressure torsion
(HPT) has been shown to be capable of mixing immiscible systems at room
temperature, and therefore represents a promising technique for homogenizing
dendritic RHEAs. In this work, the as-solidified RHEA MoNbTaTiVZr was processed
up to 40 revolutions by HPT. It was found that the dendritic microstructure was
eliminated, resulting in a chemical homogeneity at a von Mises equivalent shear
strain of about 400. The study of deformation mechanism showed an initial
strain localization, followed by a co-deformation of the dendritic and
interdendritic regions. In the co-deformation step, the Zr-rich interdendritic
region gradually disappeared. The deformation-induced mixing also led to the
formation of an ultra-fine grained (UFG) microstructure, exhibiting a grain
size of approximately 50 nm. The microhardness increased from 500 HV in the
as-solidified to 675 HV in the homogenized UFG state. The underlying mechanisms
responsible for the microhardness enhancement, such as grain refinement and
solid solution strengthening, were also discussed.

The quantitative investigation and dynamical understanding of homogeneous
nucleation remain a topic of intense research in the interdisciplinary subject.
From supercooled water, homogeneous ice nucleation will not happen
spontaneously until a critical crystallite nucleus (Nc) pre-exists. In this
work, we investigate homogeneous ice nucleation with our molecular dynamics
software SPONGE. Using metadynamics and two structural-based collective
variables, we successfully improve the sampling technic to grow spherical
nuclei with various cubicity and sizes in a 23040-water box. First, we perform
the first long-term freezing in all-atom simulation, various nuclei freeze out
into Isd. Instead of a certain cluster size based on classical nucleation
theory, the dynamic behaviors of ice nuclei experience a wide range of
intermediate states. We provide a novel critical nucleus diagram to seek the
critical nucleus: the main external factor, surface area, contributes to the
freezing speed of the ice nucleus; while the key internal factor, the mean
tetrahedral order, controls the melting speed instead. The ice nucleation rates
of our work are in good agreement with the former simulation data. We provide a
brief frame to discuss the structural details of the nucleation decision.

<h3>Voltage-time dilemma and stochastic threshold voltage variation in pure  silver atomic switches</h3>

<br>
The formation and dissolution of silver nanowires plays a fundamental role in
a broad range of resistive switching devices, fundamentally relying on the
electrochemical metallization phenomenon. It was shown, however, that resistive
switching may also appear in pure metallic nanowires lacking any
silver-ion-hosting embedding environment, but this pure atomic switching
mechanism fundamentally differs from the conventional
electrochemical-metallization-based resistive switching. To facilitate the
quantitative description of the former phenomenon, we investigate broad range
of Ag atomic junctions with a special focus on the frequency-dependence and the
fundamentally stochastic cycle-to-cycle variation of the switching threshold
voltage. These devices are established in an ultra-high purity environment
where electrochemical metallization can be excluded. The measured
characteristics are successfully described by a vibrational pumping model,
yielding consistent predictions for the weak frequency dependence and the large
variance of the switching threshold voltage. We also demonstrate that
electrochemical-metallization-based resistive switching and pure atomic
switching may appear in the same device structure, and therefore the proper
understanding of the pure atomic switching mechanism has a distinguished
importance in silver-based electrochemical metallization cells.

<br>
<br>
We study the interplay between Coulomb blockade and superconductivity in a
tunable superconductor-superconductor-normal metal single-electron transistor.
The device is realized by connecting the superconducting island via an oxide
barrier to the normal metal lead and with a break junction to the
superconducting lead. The latter enables Cooper pair transport and (multiple)
Andreev reflection. We show that those processes are relevant also far above
the superconducting gap and that signatures of Coulomb blockade may reoccur at
high bias while they are absent for small bias in the strong-coupling regime.
Our experimental findings agree with simulations using a master equation
approach in combination with the full counting statistics of multiple Andreev
reflection.

We provide an extended mathematical description of the strong correlation
between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with
in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical
temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$.
The model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$
(in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the
superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs
doping can be mechanistically explained in terms of corresponding regimes of
optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further
evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity
in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon
coupling therein.

A new microscopic formula for the viscosity of liquids and solids is derived
rigorously from a first-principles (microscopically reversible) Hamiltonian for

nonaffine linear response theory. The new formula may lead to a valid
alternative to the Green-Kubo approach to describe the viscosity of condensed

tails. Furthermore, it provides a direct link between the viscosity, the

We investigate the ultrafast lattice dynamics in ${1T-TiSe_2}$ using
femtosecond reflection pump-probe and pump-pump-probe techniques at room
temperature. The time-domain signals and Fourier-transformed spectra show the
$A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 5.9 THz. Moreover, we observe an additional mode at
$\approx$ 3 THz, corresponding to the charge-density wave (CDW) amplitude mode,
which is generally visible below T$_c \approx 200\ $K. We argue that the
emergence of the CDW amplitude mode at room temperature can be a consequence of
fluctuations of order parameters, based on the additional experiment using the
pump-pump-probe technique, which exhibited suppression of the AM signal within
the ultrafast time scale of $\sim$ 0.5 ps.

<h3>Multiscale modeling of dislocations: Combining peridynamics with  gradient elasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05782" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05782</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Ritter, Michael Zaiser</i>
<br>
<br>
Modeling dislocations is an inherently multiscale problem as one needs to
simultaneously describe the high stress fields near the dislocation cores,
which depend on atomistic length scales, and a surface boundary value problem
which depends on boundary conditions on the sample scale. We present a novel
approach which is based on a peridynamic dislocation model to deal with the
surface boundary value problem. In this model, the singularity of the stress
field at the dislocation core is regularized owing to the non-local nature of
peridynamics. The effective core radius is defined by the peridynamic horizon
which, for reasons of computational cost, must be chosen much larger than the
lattice constant. This implies that dislocation stresses in the near-core
region are seriously underestimated. By exploiting relationships between
peridynamics and Mindlin-type gradient elasticity, we then show that gradient
elasticity can be used to construct short-range corrections to the peridynamic
stress field that yield a correct description of dislocation stresses from the
atomic to the sample scale.

<br>
<br>
We examine possible ordered states of AA stacked bilayer graphene arising due
to electron-electron coupling. We show that under certain assumptions the
Hamiltonian of the system possesses an SU(4) symmetry. The multicomponent order
parameter is described by a $4\times4$ matrix $\hat{Q}$, for which a mean-field
self-consistency equation is derived. This equation allows Hermitian and
non-Hermitian solutions. Hermitian solutions can be grouped into three
topologically-distinct classes. First class corresponds to the charge density
wave. Second class includes spin density wave, valley density wave, and
spin-valley density wave. An ordered state in the third class is a combination
of all the aforementioned density-wave types. For anti-Hermitian $\hat{Q}$ the
ordered state is characterized by a spontaneous inter-layer loop currents
flowing in the bilayer. Depending on the topological class of the solution
these currents can carry charge, spin, valley, and spin-valley quanta. We also
discuss the special case when matrix $\hat{Q}$ is not Hermitian and not
anti-Hermitian. Utility and weak points of the proposed SU(4)-based
classification scheme of the ordered states are analyzed.

<br>
<br>
The integration of on-demand single photon sources in photonic circuits is a
major prerequisite for on-chip quantum applications. Among the various
high-quality sources, nanowire quantum dots can be efficiently coupled to
optical waveguides because of their preferred emission direction along their
growth direction. However, local tuning of the emission properties remains
challenging. In this work, we transfer a nanowire quantum dot on a bulk lithium
niobate substrate and show that its emission can be dynamically tuned by
acousto-optical coupling with surface acoustic waves. The purity of the single
photon source is preserved during the strain modulation. We further demonstrate
that the transduction is maintained even with a SiO2 encapsulation layer
deposited on top of the nanowire acting as the cladding of a photonic circuit.
Based on these experimental findings and numerical simulations, we introduce a
device architecture consisting of a nanowire quantum dot efficiently coupled to
a thin film lithium niobate rib waveguide and strain-tunable by surface
acoustic waves.

<br>
<br>
We study the ground state and spin excitation in Ba3MnSb2O9, an easy-plane S
= 5/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet. By combining single-crystal neutron
scattering, electric spin resonance (ESR), and spin wave calculations, we
determine the frustrated quasi-two-dimensional spin Hamiltonian parameters
describing the material. While the material has a slight monoclinic structural
distortion, which could allow for isosceles triangular exchanges and biaxial
anisotropy by symmetry, we observe no deviation from the behavior expected for
spin waves in the in-plane 120o state. Even the easy-plane anisotropy is so
small that it can only be detected by ESR in our study. In conjunction with the
quasi-two-dimensionality, our study establishes that Ba3MnSb2O9 is a nearly
ideal triangular lattice antiferromagnet with the quasi-classical spin S = 5/2,
which suggests that it has the potential for an experimental study of Z- or
Z2-vortex excitations.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic frustration is a route that can lead to the emergence of novel
ground states, including spin liquids and spin ices. Such frustration can be
introduced through either the geometry of lattice structures or by incompatible
exchange interactions. Identifying suitable strategies to control the degree of
magnetic frustration in real systems is an active field of research. In this
study, we devise a design principle for the tuning of frustrated magnetism on
the square lattice through the manipulation of nearest (NN) and next-nearest
neighbor (NNN) antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions. By studying the
magnon excitations in epitaxially-strained La$_2$NiO$_4$ films using resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) we show that, in contrast to the cuprates,
the dispersion peaks at the AF zone boundary. This indicates the presence of an
AF-NNN spin interaction. Using first principles simulations and an effective
spin-model, we demonstrate the AF-NNN coupling to be a consequence of the
two-orbital nature of La$_2$NiO$_4$. Our results demonstrate that compressive
strain can enhance this coupling, providing a design principle for the
tunability of frustrated magnetism on a square lattice.

<br>
<br>
Progressive quenching (PQ) is a process in which we sequentially fix a
system's degrees of freedom, which would otherwise evolve according to their
stochastic dynamics. Previous studies have discovered what we refer to as the
hidden martingale property in PQ. Here, we first attribute this martingale
property to the canonicity of the two-layer ensemble comprising quenched and
thermal ensembles and demonstrate that the Markovian property, coupled with the
detailed balance (DB) of the evolution dynamics, underpins this canonicity. We
then expand the PQ to the Markovian dynamics on the transition network where
the DB is locally upheld. Additionally, we examine the PQ of the systems that
evolve through non-Markovian dynamics between consecutive quenching. When
non-Markovian dynamics ensure a trajectory-wise DB, such as in an equilibrium
spin system with a hidden part, the PQ can occasionally maintain the canonical
structure of the overall statistical ensemble, but not always. Lastly, we
analytically and numerically investigate the PQ of a non-Markovian spin system
with delayed interaction and illustrate how the reduction of spin correlations
due to the delay can be compensated by the PQ.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically calculate the dynamic structure factor of two-dimensional
Rashba-type spinorbit coupled (SOC) Fermi superfluid with random phase
approximation, and analyse the main characters of dynamical excitation sh own
by both density and spin dynamic structure factor during a continuous phase
transition between Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid and topological
superfluid. Generally we find three different excitations, including collective
phonon excitation, two-atom molecular and atomic excitations, and pair-breaking
excitations due to two-branch structure of quasi-particle spectrum. It should
be emphasized that collective phonon excitation is overlapped with a gapless DD
type pair-breaking excitation at the critical Zeeman field hc, and is imparted
a finite width to phonon peak when transferred momentum q is around Fermi
vector kF. At a much larger transferred momentum (q = 4kF ), the pair-breaking
excitation happens earlier than two-atom molecular excitation, which is
different from the conventional Fermi superfluid without SOC effect.

We present an experimental realization of dynamic self-trapping and
non-exponential tunneling in a multi-state system consisting of ultracold
sodium spinor gases confined in moving optical lattices. Taking advantage of
the fact that the tunneling process in the sodium spinor system is resolvable
over a broader dynamic energy scale than previously observed in rubidium scalar
gases, we demonstrate that the tunneling dynamics in the multi-state system
strongly depends on an interaction induced nonlinearity and is influenced by
the spin degree of freedom under certain conditions. We develop a rigorous
multi-state tunneling model to describe the observed dynamics. Combined with
our recent observation of spatially-manipulated spin dynamics, these results
open up prospects for alternative multi-state ramps and state transfer
protocols.

The process of anomalous transfer of interstitial atoms during impact
deformation of the crystal surface is described theoretically. As shown that
surface impact leads to the formation of a wave of inhomogeneous atomic
displacements in the medium, which propagates from the surface into the depth
of the crystal. The formation of a deformation wave leads to a change in the
interatomic distance at the wave front and a change in the potential energy for
interstitial atoms. Interstitial atoms at the front of the deformation wave
receive an additional impulse, which leads to an increase in their kinetic
energy and contributes their movement deep into the crystal.

<h3>In search of a precursor for crystal nucleation of hard and charged  colloids</h3>

<br>
<br>
The interplay between crystal nucleation and the structure of the metastable
fluid has been a topic of significant debate over recent years. In particular,
it has been suggested that even in simple model systems such as hard or charged
colloids, crystal nucleation might be foreshadowed by significant fluctuations
in local structure around the location where the first nucleus arises. We
investigate this using computer simulations of spontaneous nucleation events in
both hard and charged colloidal particles. To detect local structural
variations, we use both standard and unsupervised machine learning methods
capable of finding hidden structures in the metastable fluid phase. We track
numerous nucleation events for the face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic
crystal on a local level, and demonstrate that all signs of crystallinity
emerge simultaneously from the very start of the nucleation process. We thus
conclude that there is no precursor for the nucleation of charged colloids.

<h3>The emergence of global phase coherence from local pairing in underdoped  cuprates</h3>

<br>
<br>
In conventional metal superconductors such as aluminum, the large number of
weakly bounded Cooper pairs become phase coherent as soon as they start to
form. The cuprate high critical temperature ($T_c$) superconductors, in
contrast, belong to a distinctively different category. To account for the high
$T_c$, the attractive pairing interaction is expected to be strong and the
coherence length is short. Being doped Mott insulators, the cuprates are known
to have low superfluid density, thus are susceptible to phase fluctuations. It
has been proposed that pairing and phase coherence may occur separately in
cuprates, and $T_c$ corresponds to the phase coherence temperature controlled
by the superfluid density. To elucidate the microscopic processes of pairing
and phase ordering in cuprates, here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to
image the evolution of electronic states in underdoped $\rm
Bi_2La_xSr_{2-x}CuO_{6+{\delta}}$. Even in the insulating sample, we observe a
smooth crossover from the Mott insulator to superconductor-type spectra on
small islands with chequerboard order and emerging quasiparticle interference
patterns following the octet model. Each chequerboard plaquette contains
approximately two holes, and exhibits a stripy internal structure that has
strong influence on the superconducting features. Across the insulator to
superconductor boundary, the local spectra remain qualitatively the same while
the quasiparticle interferences become long-ranged. These results suggest that
the chequerboard plaquette with internal stripes plays a crucial role on local
pairing in cuprates, and the global phase coherence is established once its
spatial occupation exceeds a threshold.

<br>
<br>
The microscopic mechanism for the disappearance of superconductivity in
overdoped cuprates is still under heated debate. Here we use scanning tunneling
spectroscopy to investigate the evolution of quasiparticle interference
phenomenon in $\rm Bi_2Sr_2CuO_{6+\delta}$ over a wide range of hole densities.
We find that when the system enters the overdoped regime, a peculiar
quasiparticle interference wavevector with quarter-circle pattern starts to
emerge even at zero bias, and its intensity grows with increasing doping level.
Its energy dispersion is incompatible with the octet model for d-wave
superconductivity, but is highly consistent with the scattering interference of
gapless normal carriers. The weight of the gapless quasiparticle interference
is mainly located at the antinodes and is independent of temperature. We
propose that the normal fluid emerges from the pair-breaking scattering between
flat antinodal bands in the quantum ground state, which is the primary cause
for the reduction of superfluid density and suppression of superconductivity in
overdoped cuprates.

<h3>Combining the $Δ$-Self-Consistent-Field and GW Methods for  Predicting Core Electron Binding Energies in Periodic Solids</h3>

<br>
<i>Juhan Matthias Kahk, Johannes Lischner</i>
<br>
<br>
For the computational prediction of core electron binding energies in solids,
two distinct kinds of modelling strategies have been pursued: the
$\Delta$-Self-Consistent-Field method based on density functional theory (DFT),
and the GW method. In this study, we examine the formal relationship between
these two approaches, and establish a link between them. The link arises from
the equivalence, in DFT, between the total energy difference result for the
first ionization energy, and the eigenvalue of the highest occupied state, in
the limit of infinite supercell size. This link allows us to introduce a new
formalism, which highlights how in DFT - even if the total energy difference
method is used to calculate core electron binding energies - the accuracy of
the results still implicitly depends on the accuracy of the eigenvalue at the
valence band maximum in insulators, or at the Fermi level in metals. We
examine, whether incorporating a quasiparticle correction for this eigenvalue
from GW theory improves the accuracy of the calculated core electron binding
energies, and find that the inclusion of vertex corrections is required for
achieving quantitative agreement with experiment.

The site-site Ornstein-Zernike equation combined with the Verlet-modified
bridge function has been applied to the binary hard sphere mixtures and
pressure consistency has been tested. An equation of state has been computed
for the case where a packing fraction is $\eta = 0.49$, diameter ratios are
$\sigma_{2}/\sigma_{1} = 0.3$ and $0.6$, and the mole fractions are $x_{1} =
0.125, 0.5, 0.75$, and $1$. An excess chemical potential for each component has
been obtained as well. Our findings for thermodynamic properties are in good
agreement with available data in literature.

The Ornstein-Zernike integral equation method has been employed for a
single-component hard sphere fluid in terms of the Percus-Yevick (PY) and
Martynov-Sarkisov (MS) approximations. Virial equation of state has been
computed in both approximations. An excess chemical potential has been
calculated with an analytical expression based on correlation functions, and
the entropy has been computed with a thermodynamic relation. Calculations have
been carried out for a reduced densities of 0.1 to 0.9. It has been shown that
the MS approximation gives better values than those from the PY approximation,
especially for high densities and presents a reasonable comparison with
available data in the literature.

<h3>Magnetic pinning of Andreev levels in epitaxial  semiconductor-superconductor nanowires</h3>

<br>
<br>
An epitaxial semiconductor-superconductor nanowire is a superconducting
system with a complex level structure originating from the hybridization: in
addition to a dense set of higher-energy states derived predominantly from the
metallic superconducting shell above the bulk gap $\Delta$, there is a small
number of lower-energy proximitized states from the semiconducting core that
define the induced gap $\Delta^*$. Nanostructures based on such nanowires can
furthermore incorporate quantum dots to confine a handful of electrons in order
to obtain localized spins for storing and manipulating quantum information.
Magnetic properties of these composite devices are complex due to the interplay
of exchange interaction, electron correlation effects and the spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). We discuss the magnetic field dependence in three devices with
different combinations of embedded quantum dots and superconducting islands.
For strong fields, they show pinning of excitation energies to a uniform
spacing, even if for weak fields they have non-universal properties with
clearly different behaviors for even and odd number of confined electrons. We
propose a quantum impurity model for hybrid devices that incorporates all
relevant effects and solve it. We show that the model accounts for the key
observations and permits unambiguous interpretation of phenomena in terms of
many-particle states. In particular, we study the replicas of the
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in the hybrid gap, their collapse and oscillation
around zero bias with increasing field, and the strong smoothing effect of the
SOC on these oscillations. We conclude that the SOC-induced mixing of many-body
states is a generic mechanism for magnetic pinning and that it is likely to be
a ubiquitous feature in hybrid semi-super nanowires.

<h3>The structural stability and polarization analysis of rhombohedral phase  HfO2</h3>

A comparative theoretical study is presented for the rhombohedral R3 and R3m
phase HfO2, of two possible forms in its heavily Zr-doped ferroelectric thin
films found recently in experiments. Their structural stability and
polarization under the in-plane compressive strain are comprehensively
investigated. We discovered that there is a phase transition from R3 to R3m
phase under the biaxial compressive strain. Both the direction and amplitude of
their polarization can be tuned by the strain. By performing a symmetry mode
analysis, we are able to understand its improper nature of the
ferroelectricity. These results may help to shed light on the understanding of
the hafnia ferroelectric thin films.

The remarkable technical contributions of Michael E. Fisher to statistical
physics and the development of the renormalization group are widely known and
deeply influential. But less well-known is his early and profound appreciation
of the way in which renormalization group created a revolution in our
understanding of how physics -- in fact, all science -- is practiced, and the
concomitant adjustment that needs to be made to our conception of the purpose
and philosophy of science. In this essay, I attempt to redress this imbalance,
with examples from Fisher's writings and my own work. It is my hope that this
tribute will help remove some of the confusion that surrounds the scientific
usage of minimal models and renormalization group concepts, as well as their
limitations, in the ongoing effort to understand emergence in complex systems.
This paper will be published in "50 years of the renormalization group",
dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher, edited by Amnon Aharony, Ora

<h3>Interplay Between Magnetic Frustration and Quantum Criticality in the  Unconventional Ladder Antiferromagnet C9H18N2CuBr4</h3>

Quantum fluctuation in frustrated magnets and quantum criticality at the
transition between different quantum phases of matter are two of the
cornerstones in condensed matter physics. Here we demonstrate the nontrivial
interplay between them in the spin-1/2 coupled two-leg ladder antiferromagnet
C9H18N2CuBr4. Employing the high-resolution neutron spectroscopy, we
unambiguously identify a weakly first-order hydrostatic pressure-driven quantum
phase transition, which arises from fluctuations enhanced by the frustrating
interlayer coupling. An exotic pressure-induced quantum disordered state is
evidenced by the broad spectral linewidth observed near the phase transition.
Interestingly, we find that the gapped transverse excitations in the
Neel-ordered phase at ambient pressure cannot be described by the conventional
S=1 magnons, i.e., the spin wave quanta, associated with explicit symmetry
breaking, and thus the three-dimensional magnetic order ought to emerge in an
unconventional way. We further apply the quantum Fisher information to show the
presence of bipartite entanglement at criticality at least up to 1.1 K in the
same material.

<h3>Machine learning the electronic structure of matter across temperatures</h3>

We introduce machine learning (ML) models that predict the electronic
structure of materials across a wide temperature range. Our models employ
neural networks and are trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Unlike
other ML models that use DFT data, our models directly predict the local
density of states (LDOS) of the electronic structure. This provides several
advantages, including access to multiple observables such as the electronic
density and electronic total free energy. Moreover, our models account for both
the electronic and ionic temperatures independently, making them ideal for
applications like laser-heating of matter. We validate the efficacy of our
LDOS-based models on a metallic test system. They accurately capture energetic
effects induced by variations in ionic and electronic temperatures over a broad
temperature range, even when trained on a subset of these temperatures. These
findings open up exciting opportunities for investigating the electronic
structure of materials under both ambient and extreme conditions.

<h3>Possible high $T_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high  pressure through manifestation of a nearly-half-filled bilayer Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Inspired by a recent experiment showing that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits high
$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure, we theoretically revisit the
possibility of superconductivity in this material. We find that
superconductivity can take place which is essentially similar to that of the
bilayer Hubbard model consisting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals. Although
the coupling with the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals degrades superconductivity, $T_c$
can still be high enough to understand the experiment thanks to the very high
$T_c$ reached in the bilayer Hubbard model.

We present an analytic study of the Potts model partition function on the
Sierpinski and Hanoi lattices, which are self-similar lattices of triangular
shape with non integer Hausdorff dimension. Both lattices are examples of
non-trivial thermodynamics in less than two dimensions, where mean field theory
does not apply. We used and explain a method based on ideas of graph theory and
renormalization group theory to derive exact equations for appropriate
variables that are similar to the restricted partition functions. We benchmark
our method with Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations. The analysis of fixed
points reveals information of location of the Fisher zeros and we provide a
conjecture about the location of zeros in terms of the boundary of the basins
of attraction.
