<h3>Heavy-fermion strange metal and quantum spin liquid in a 4d-electron  trimer lattice</h3>

Strange metals, heavy fermion metals, and quantum spin liquids are among the
most intriguing and yet intellectually challenging topics in condensed matter
physics. Here we report the experimental discovery of a perpetual heavy Fermi
surface consisting of charge-neutral spinons that underpins both a
heavy-fermion strange metal and a quantum spin liquid, which occur in an
unlikely place, a 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12. Both states
exhibit a universally large storage of entropy at the milli-Kelvin regime and a
disassociation of charges and spins as such the heavy-fermion strange metal
grossly violates the Wiedemann-Franz law, and the quantum spin liquid is a much
better thermal conductor than the heavy-fermion strange metal. The novel
phenomenology offers an unprecedented paradigm of correlated quantum matter.

<h3>Nonreciprocal interactions give rise to fast cilium synchronisation in  finite systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01077" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01077</a>

Motile cilia beat in an asymmetric fashion in order to propel the surrounding
fluid. When many cilia are located on a surface, their beating can synchronise
such that their phases form metachronal waves. Here, we computationally study a
model where each cilium is represented as a spherical particle, moving along a
tilted trajectory with a position-dependent active driving force and a
position-dependent internal drag coefficient. The model thus takes into account
all the essential broken symmetries of the ciliary beat. We show that taking
into account the near-field hydrodynamic interactions, the effective coupling
between cilia can become nonreciprocal: the phase of a cilium is more strongly
affected by an adjacent cilium on one side than by a cilium at the same
distance in the opposite direction. As a result, synchronisation starts from a
seed at the edge of a group of cilia and propagates rapidly across the system,
leading to a synchronisation time that scales proportionally to the linear
dimension of the system. We show that a ciliary carpet is characterised by
three different velocities: the velocity of fluid transport, the phase velocity
of metachronal waves and the group velocity of order propagation. Unlike in
systems with reciprocal coupling, boundary effects are not detrimental for
synchronisation, but rather enable the formation of the initial seed.

<h3>BCS-like disorder-driven instabilities and ultraviolet effects in  nodal-line semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00990" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00990</a>

<i>Siyu Zhu, Sergey Syzranov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of quenched disorder on electrons in a 3D nodal-line
semimetal. Disorder leads to significant renormalisations of the quasiparticle
properties due to ultraviolet processes, i.e. processes of scattering in a
large band of momenta, of the width exceeding the inverse mean free path. As a
result, observables such as the density of states and conductivity exhibit
singular behaviour in a broad range of disorder strengths, excluding a small
vicinity of the singular point. We find that, for example, the density of
quasiparticle states diverges as a function of the disorder strength $g$ as
$\rho(g,E)\propto |g_c(E)-g|^{-2}|E|$ for $g$ smaller than the critical value
$g_c(E)$ and crosses over to a constant for $g$ very close to $g_c(E)$, where
$E$ is the quasiparticle energy. For certain disorder symmetries, a 3D
disordered nodal-line semimetal can be mapped to a 2D metal with attractive
interactions. The described disorder-driven instabilities in such a nodal-line
semimetal are mapped to Cooper and exciton-condensation instabilities in a 2D
metal. For other disorder symmetries, the respective instabilities are similar
but not exactly dual. We discuss experimental conditions favourable for the
observation of the described effects.

The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model provides a solvable theory of entangled

<h3>Reconstruction-Induced $\varphi_0$ Josephson Effect in Quantum Spin Hall  Constrictions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01003" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01003</a>

<br>
<br>
The simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, in
connection to superconductivity, leads to transport properties with disrupting
scientific and technological potential. Indeed, the anomalous Josephson effect
and the superconducting-diode effect hold promises to enlarge the technological
applications of superconductors and nanostructures in general. In this context,
the system we theoretically analyze is a Josephson junction (JJ) with coupled
reconstructed topological channels as a link; such channels are at the edges of
a two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI). We find a robust $\varphi_0$
Josephson effect without requiring the presence of external magnetic fields.
Our results, which rely on a fully analytical analysis, are substantiated by
means of symmetry arguments: Our system breaks both time-reversal symmetry and
inversion symmetry. Moreover, the anomalous current increases as a function of
temperature. We interpret this surprising temperature dependence by means of
simple qualitative arguments based on Fermi's golden rule.

<h3>Interaction-driven topological phase diagram of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Wen-Xuan Qiu, Bohao Li, Xun-Jiang Luo, Fengcheng Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ is a promising platform to investigate the interplay
between topology and many-body interaction. We present a theoretical study of
its interaction-driven quantum phase diagrams based on a three-orbital model,
which can be viewed as a generalization of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with an
additional orbital and realistic Coulomb repulsion. We predict a cascade of
phase transitions tuned by the twist angle $\theta$. At the hole filling factor
$\nu=1$ (one hole per moir\'e unit cell), the ground state can be in the
multiferroic phase with coexisting spontaneous layer polarization and
magnetism, the quantum anomalous Hall phase, and finally the topologically
trivial magnetic phases, as $\theta$ increases from $1.5^{\circ}$ to
$5^{\circ}$. At $\nu=2$, the ground state can have a second-order phase
transition between an antiferromagnetic phase and the quantum spin Hall phase
as $\theta$ passes through a critical value. The dependence of the phase
boundaries on model parameters such as the gate-to-sample distance, the
dielectric constant, and the moir\'e potential amplitude is examined. The
predicted phase diagrams can guide the search for topological phases in twisted
transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers.

<h3>First Direct Observation of Nanometer size Hydride Precipitations on  Superconducting Niobium</h3>

Superconducting niobium serves as a key enabling material for superconducting
radio frequency (SRF) technology as well as quantum computing devices. At room
temperature, hydrogen commonly occupies tetragonal sites in the Nb lattice as
metal (M)-gas (H) phase. When the temperature is decreased, however, solid
solution of Nb-H starts to be precipitated. In this study, we show the first
identified topographical features associated with nanometer-size hydride phase
(Nb1-xHx) precipitates on metallic superconducting niobium using
cryogenic-atomic force microscopy (AFM). Further, high energy grazing incidence
X-ray diffraction reveals information regarding the structure and stoichiometry
that these precipitates exhibit. Finally, through time-of-flight secondary ion
mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), we are able to locate atomic hydrogen sources
near the top surface. This systematic study further explains localized
degradation of RF superconductivity by the proximity effect due to hydrogen
clusters.

<h3>Making Atomic-Level Magnetism Tunable with Light at Room Temperature</h3>

The capacity to manipulate magnetization in two-dimensional dilute magnetic
semiconductors (2D-DMSs) using light, specifically in magnetically doped
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers (M-doped TX2, where M = V, Fe,
Cr; T = W, Mo; X = S, Se, Te), may lead to innovative applications in
spintronics, spin-caloritronics, valleytronics, and quantum computation. This
Perspective paper explores the mediation of magnetization by light under
ambient conditions in 2D-TMD DMSs and heterostructures. By combining magneto-LC
resonance (MLCR) experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
we show that the magnetization can be enhanced using light in V-doped TMD
monolayers (e.g., V-WS2, V-WSe2, V-MoS2). This phenomenon is attributed to
excess holes in the conduction and valence bands, as well as carriers trapped
in magnetic doping states, which together mediate the magnetization of the
semiconducting layer. In 2D-TMD heterostructures such as VSe2/WS2 and
VSe2/MoS2, we demonstrate the significance of proximity, charge-transfer, and
confinement effects in amplifying light-mediated magnetism. This effect is
attributed to photon absorption at the TMD layer (e.g., WS2, MoS2) that
generates electron-hole pairs mediating the magnetization of the
heterostructure. These findings will encourage further research in the field of
2D magnetism and establish a novel direction for designing 2D-TMDs and
heterostructures with optically tunable magnetic functionalities, paving the
way for next-generation magneto-optic nanodevices.

<h3>Activity-driven phase transition causes coherent flows of chromatin</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01052</a>
<br>
<i>Iraj Eshghi, Alexanda Zidovska, Alexander Y. Grosberg</i>
<br>
<br>
We discover a new type of nonequilibrium phase transition in a model of
chromatin dynamics, which accounts for the coherent motions that have been
observed in experiment. The coherent motion is due to the long-range
cooperation of molecular motors tethered to chromatin. Cooperation occurs if
each motor acts simultaneously on the polymer and the surrounding solvent,
exerting on them equal and opposite forces. This drives the flow of solvent
past the polymer, which in turn affects the orientation of nearby motors and,
if the drive is strong enough, an active polar (``ferromagnetic'') phase of
motors can spontaneously form. Depending on boundary conditions, either
transverse flows, or sustained longitudinal oscillations and waves are
possible. Predicted time and length scales are consistent with experiments. We
now have in hand a coarse-grained description of chromatin dynamics which
reproduces the directed coherent flows of chromatin seen in experiments. This
field-theoretic description can be analytically coupled to other features of
the nuclear environment such as fluctuating or porous boundaries, local
heterogeneities in the distribution of chromatin or its activity, leading to
insights on the effects of activity on the cell nucleus and its contents.

<h3>One-point height fluctuations and two-point correlators of $(2+1)$  cylindrical KPZ systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01062" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01062</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
While the 1-point height distributions (HDs) and 2-point covariances of
$(2+1)$ KPZ systems have been investigated in several recent works for flat and
spherical geometries, for the cylindrical one the HD was analyzed for few
models and nothing is known about the spatial and temporal covariances. Here,
we report results for these quantities, obtained from extensive numerical
simulations of discrete KPZ models, for three different setups yielding
cylindrical growth. Beyond demonstrating the universality of the HD and
covariances, our results reveal other interesting features of this geometry.
For example, the spatial covariances measured along the longitudinal and
azimuthal directions are different, with the former being quite similar to the
curve for flat $(2+1)$ KPZ systems, while the latter resembles the Airy$_2$
covariance of circular $(1+1)$ KPZ interfaces. We also argue (and present
numerical evidence) that, in general, the rescaled temporal covariance
$\mathcal{A}(t/t_0)$ decays asymptotically as $\mathcal{A}(x) \sim
x^{-\bar{\lambda}}$ with an exponent $\bar{\lambda} = \beta + d^*/z$, where
$d^*$ is the number of interface sides kept fixed during the growth (being $d^*
= 1$ for the systems analyzed here). Overall, these results complete the
picture of the main statistics for the $(2+1)$ KPZ class.

Kagome metals are widely recognized as versatile platforms for exploring
novel topological properties, unconventional electronic correlations, magnetic
frustration, and superconductivity. In the $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ family of materials
($R$ = Sc, Y, Lu), ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ hosts an unusual charge density wave ground
state as well as structural similarities with the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ system ($A$ =
K, Cs, Rb). In this work, we combine Raman scattering spectroscopy with
first-principles lattice dynamics calculations to reveal the charge density
wave state in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. In the low temperature phase, we find a five-fold
splitting of the V-containing totally symmetric mode near 240 cm$^{-1}$
suggesting that the density wave acts to mix modes of $P$6/$mmm$ and
$R$$\bar{3}$$m$ symmetry - an effect that we quantify by projecting phonons of
the high symmetry state onto those of the lower symmetry structure. We also
test the stability of the density wave state under compression and find that
both physical and chemical pressure act to quench the effect. We discuss these
findings in terms of symmetry and the structure-property trends that can be
unraveled in this system.

<h3>Leveraging Language Representation for Material Recommendation, Ranking,  and Exploration</h3>

Data-driven approaches for material discovery and design have been
accelerated by emerging efforts in machine learning. While there is enormous
progress towards learning the structure to property relationship of materials,
methods that allow for general representations of crystals to effectively
explore the vast material search space and identify high-performance candidates
remain limited. In this work, we introduce a material discovery framework that
uses natural language embeddings derived from material science-specific
language models as representations of compositional and structural features.
The discovery framework consists of a joint scheme that, given a query
material, first recalls candidates based on representational similarity, and
ranks the candidates based on target properties through multi-task learning.
The contextual knowledge encoded in language representations is found to convey
information about material properties and structures, enabling both similarity
analysis for recall, and multi-task learning to share information for related
properties. By applying the discovery framework to thermoelectric materials, we
demonstrate diversified recommendations of prototype structures and identify
under-studied high-performance material spaces, including halide perovskite,
delafossite-like, and spinel-like structures. By leveraging material language
representations, our framework provides a generalized means for effective
material recommendation, which is task-agnostic and can be applied to various
material systems.

<h3>Enhanced phoretic self-propulsion of active colloids through surface  charge asymmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01102</a>
<br>
<i>Ahis Shrestha, Monica Olvera de la Cruz</i>
<br>
<br>
Charged colloidal particles propel themselves through asymmetric fluxes of
chemically generated ions on their surface. We show that asymmetry in the
surface charge distribution introduces a new mode of self-phoretic motion for
chemically active particles that produce ionic species. Particles of sizes
smaller than or comparable to the Debye length achieve directed self-propulsion
through surface charge asymmetry even when ionic flux is uniform over the
particle surface. Janus nanoparticles endowed with both surface charge and
ionic flux asymmetries results in enhanced propulsion speeds of the order of
$\mu$m/s or higher. Our work provides a theoretical framework to quantitatively
determine the velocity of asymmetrically charged nanoparticles undergoing ionic
self-diffusiophoresis, and suggests an avenue for specifying surface properties
that optimize and regulate self-propulsion in ionic media.

<h3>Creating a three dimensional intrinsic electric dipole on rotated  CrI$_3$ bilayers</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) materials are being explored as a novel multiferroic
platform. One of the most studied magnetoelectric multiferroic 2D materials are
antiferromagnetically-coupled (AFM) CrI$_3$ bilayers. Neglecting magnetism,
those bilayers possess a crystalline point of inversion, which is only removed
by the antiparallel spin configuration among its two constituent monolayers.
The resultant intrinsic electric dipole on those bilayers has a magnitude no
larger than 0.04 pC/m, it points out-of-plane, and it reverts direction when
the--Ising-like--cromium spins are flipped (toward opposite layers {\em versus}
away from opposite layers). The combined presence of antiferromagnetism and a
weak intrinsic electric dipole makes this material a two-dimensional
magnetoelectric multiferroic. Here, we remove the crystalline center of
inversion of the bilayer by a relative $60^{\circ}$ rotation of its constituent
monolayers. This process {\em enhances} the out-of-plane intrinsic electric
dipole tenfold with respect to its magnitude in the non-rotated AFM bilayer and
also creates an even stronger and switchable in-plane intrinsic electric
dipole. The ability to create a three-dimensional electric dipole is important,
because it enhances the magnetoelectric coupling on this experimentally
accessible 2D material, which is explicitly calculated here as well.

<h3>Combined effect of mutually frequency-detuned strong and weak drives on  a two-level system: Envelope of the Rabi oscillations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01136" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01136</a>
<br>
<i>M. E. Raikh</i>
<br>
<br>
Near-resonant ac-drive acting on a two-level system induces the Rabi
oscillations of the level occupations. It is shown that additional weak drive
properly frequency-detuned from the primary drive causes a resonant response.
This response manifests itself in the emergence of the envelope of the
oscillations. At resonance, the inverse period of the envelope is proportional
to the amplitude of the weak drive. The resonant condition reads: difference of
frequencies between the two drives is equal to the ac-splitting of quasilevels
in the field of the strong drive. Technically, the resonance can be inferred
from the analogy between the equations for the time-evolution of the spin
amplitude and the Mathieu equation, which describes e.g. the parametric
resonance.

<h3>Role of bias and tunneling asymmetries in nonlinear Fermi-liquid  transport through an SU($N$) quantum dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01162</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, Yoshimichi Teratani, Kaiji Motoyama, Rui Sakano, Akira Oguri</i>
<br>
<br>
We study how bias and tunneling asymmetries affect nonlinear current through
a quantum dot with $N$ discrete levels in the Fermi liquid regime, using an
exact low-energy expansion of the current derived up to terms of order $V^3$
with respect to the bias voltage. The expansion coefficients are described in
terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body
correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of
the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an
essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear
current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of
independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with
$N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the
low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range
of electron fillings of the Anderson impurity model with the SU($N$) internal
symmetry, using the numerical renormalization group. We find that the order
$V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at
electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions,
significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries
increase. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime toward the empty or
fully occupied impurity state, a sharp peak emerges in the coefficient of $V^3$
current in the case at which bias and tunneling asymmetries cooperatively
enhance the charge transfer from one of the electrodes.

<h3>Direct observations of spin fluctuations in spin-hedgehog-anti-hedgehog  lattice states in MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ ($x=0.6$ and $0.8$) at zero magnetic  field</h3>

<br>
The helimagnetic compounds MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$ show the three-dimensional
multiple-$q$ order as referred to as spin-hedgehog-anti-hedgehog (SHAH)
lattice. Two representative forms of SHAH are cubic-3$q$ lattice with $q \|
\langle100\rangle$ and tetrahedral-4$q$ lattice with $q \| \langle111\rangle$,
which show up typically for $x=1.0-~0.8$ and for $x=0.6$, respectively. Here,
we have investigated the spin fluctuations in the MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$
polycrystalline samples with $x=0.6$ and $0.8$ by using the time-of-flight
(TOF) neutron inelastic scattering and MIEZE-type neutron spin echo techniques
to elucidate the microscopic origin of the unconventional Hall effect in the
SHAH lattice states. This research is motivated by the observation of a sign
change in the unconventional Hall resistivity as a function of temperature [Y.
Fujishiro et al., Nat. Comm. $\textbf{10}$, 1059 (2019)]. The present results
reveal the correspondences between the temperature ranges where the positive
Hall resistivity and spin fluctuations are observed. These results agree well
with the theoretical model of the conduction electrons scattered by the
fluctuating spin clusters with a non-zero average of sign-biased scalar spin
chirality as a mechanism of the positive Hall resistivity [H. Ishizuka and N.
Nagaosa, Sci. Adv. $\textbf{4}$, eaap9962 (2018)].

<h3>Quasicrystalline structure of the Smith monotile tilings</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We show that the tilings of the plane with the Smith hat aperiodic monotile
(and its mirror image) are quasicrystals with hexagonal (C6) rotational
symmetry. Although this symmetry is compatible with periodicity, the tilings
are quasiperiodic with an incommensurate ratio characterizing the
quasiperiodicity that stays locked to the golden mean as the tile parameters
are continuously varied. Smith et al. [arXiv:2303.10798 (2023)] have shown that
the hat tiling can be constructed as a decoration of a substitution tiling
employing a set of four "metatiles." We analyze a modification of the metatiles
that yields a set of "Key tiles," constructing a continuous family of Key tiles
that contains the family corresponding to the Smith metatiles. The Key tilings
can be constructed as projections of a subset of 6-dimensional hypercubic
lattice points onto the two-dimensional tiling plane, and when projected onto a
certain 4-dimensional subspace this subset uniformly fills four equilateral
triangles. We use this feature to analytically compute the diffraction pattern
of a set of unit masses placed at the tiling vertices, thereby establishing the
quasiperiodic nature of the tiling. We comment on several unusual features of
the family of Key tilings and hat decorations and show the tile rearrangements
associated with two tilings that differ by an infinitesimal phason shift.

<h3>Cyclic Ferroelectric Switching and Quantized Charge Transport in  CuInP$_2$S$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01182</a>

<i>Daniel Seleznev, Sobhit Singh, John Bonini, Karin M. Rabe, David Vanderbilt</i>
<br>
<br>
The van der Waals layered ferroelectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ has been found to
exhibit a variety of intriguing properties arising from the fact that the Cu
ions are unusually mobile in this system. While the polarization switching
mechanism is usually understood to arise from Cu ion motion within the
monolayers, a second switching path involving Cu motion across the van der
Waals gaps has been suggested. In this work, we perform zero-temperature
first-principles calculations on such switching paths, focusing on two types
that preserve the periodicity of the primitive unit cell: ``cooperative" paths
preserving the system's glide mirror symmetry, and ``sequential" paths in which
the two Cu ions in the unit cell move independently of each other. We find that
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ features a rich and varied energy landscape, and that sequential
paths are clearly favored energetically both for cross-gap and through-layer
paths. Importantly, these segments can be assembled to comprise a globally
insulating cycle with the out-of-plane polarization evolving by a quantum as
the Cu ions shift to neighboring layers. In this sense, we argue that
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ embodies the physics of a quantized adiabatic charge pump.

Spin susceptibility in the superconducting (SC) state was measured in the
higher-quality sample of uranium-based superconductor UTe$_2$ by using
Knight-shift measurements for a magnetic field $H$ along all three crystalline
axes. In the higher-quality sample, the SC transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$
is about 2.1 K, and the residual electronic term in the specific heat is almost
zero. The NMR linewidth becomes narrower and is almost half of that in the
previous sample with $T_{\rm c} \sim 1.6$ K when $H \parallel a$ and $c$.
Although the Knight-shift behavior was not so different from the previous
results for $H \parallel b$, and $c$, a large reduction in Knight shift along
the $a$ axis was observed, in contrast with the previous $a$-axis Knight shift
result. We discuss the origin of the difference between the previous and
present results, and the possible SC state derived from the present results.

<br>
<br>
To investigate the static and dynamic magnetic properties on the
uranium-based superconductor UTe$_{2}$, we measured the NMR Knight shift $K$
and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ in $H \parallel a$ by
$^{125}$Te-NMR on a $^{125}$Te-enriched single-crystal sample. $1/T_1T$ in $H
\parallel a$ is much smaller than $1/T_1T$ in $H \parallel b$ and $c$, and
magnetic fluctuations along each axis are derived from the $1/T_1T$ measured in
$H$ parallel to all three crystalline axes. The magnetic fluctuations are
almost identical at two Te sites and isotropic at high temperatures, but become
anisotropic below 40 K, where heavy-fermion state is formed. The character of
magnetic fluctuations in UTe$_2$ is discussed with the comparison to its static
susceptibility and the results on other U-based superconductors. It is
considered that the magnetic fluctuations probed with the NMR measurements are
determined by the magnetic properties inside the two-leg ladder formed by U
atoms, which are dominated by the $q_a$ = 0 ferromagnetic fluctuations.

Rich out of equilibrium collective dynamics of strongly interacting large
assemblies emerge in many areas of science. Some intriguing and not fully
understood examples are the glassy arrest in atomic, molecular or colloidal
systems, flocking in natural or artificial active matter, and the organization
and subsistence of ecosystems. The learning process, and ensuing amazing
performance, of deep neural networks bears resemblance with some of the
before-mentioned examples. Quantum mechanical extensions are also of interest.
In exact or approximate manner the evolution of these systems can be expressed
in terms of a dynamical mean-field theory which not only captures many of their
peculiar effects but also has predictive power. This short review presents a
summary of recent developments of this approach with emphasis on applications
on the examples mentioned above.

<h3>Lipid exchange promotes fusion of model protocells</h3>

Vesicle fusion is an important process underlying cell division, transport,
and membrane trafficking. In phospholipid systems, a range of fusogens
including divalent cations and depletants have been shown to induce adhesion,
hemifusion, and then full content fusion between vesicles. This works shows
that these fusogens do not perform the same function for fatty acid vesicles,
which are used as model protocells (primitive cells). Even when fatty acid
vesicles appear adhered or hemifused to each other, the intervening barriers
between vesicles do not rupture. This difference is likely because fatty acids
have a single aliphatic tail, and are more dynamic than their phospholipid
counterparts. To address this, we postulate that fusion could instead occur
under conditions, such as lipid exchange, that disrupt lipid packing. Using
both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we verify that fusion in
fatty acid systems can indeed be induced by lipid exchange. These results begin
to probe how membrane biophysics could constrain the evolutionary dynamics of
protocells.

We present an experimental study on the etching of detonation nanodiamond
(DND) seeds during typical microwave chemical vapor deposition (MWCVD)
conditions leading to ultra-thin diamond film formation, which is fundamental
for many technological applications. The temporal evolution of the surface
density of seeds on Si(100) substrate has been assessed by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The resulting kinetics have been explained in the framework
of a model based on the effect of particle size, according to the Young-Laplace
equation, on both chemical potential of carbon atoms in DND and activation
energy of reaction. We found that seeds with size smaller than a critical
radius, r*, are etched away while those greater than r* can grow. Finally, the
model allows to estimate the rate coefficients for growth and etching from the
experimental kinetics.

Localised emission from defect states in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides is of great interest for optoelectronic and quantum device
applications. Recent progress towards high temperature localised emission
relies on the application of strain to induce highly confined excitonic states.
Here we propose an alternative paradigm based on curvature, rather than
in-plane stretching, achieved through free-standing wrinkles of monolayer
tungsten diselenide (WSe2). We probe these nanostructures using tip-enhanced
optical spectroscopy to reveal the spatial localisation of out-of-plane
polarised emission from the WSe2 wrinkles. Based on the photoluminescence and
Raman scattering signatures resolved with nanoscale spatial resolution, we
propose the existence of a manifold of spin-forbidden excitonic states that are
activated by the local curvature of the WSe2. We are able to access these dark
states through the out-of-plane polarised surface plasmon polariton resulting
in enhanced strongly localised emission at room temperature, which is of
potential interest for quantum technologies and photonic devices.

<h3>Universal Lower and Upper Bounds of Efficiency of Heat Engines from  Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</h3>

According to Thermodynamics, the efficiency of a heat engine is upper bounded
by Carnot efficiency. For macroscopic systems, the Carnot efficiency is,
however, achieved only for quasi static processes. And, considerable attention
has been paid to provide general evaluation of the efficiency at a finite
speed. Recently, several upper bounds of the efficiency have been derived in
the context of the trade-off among the efficiency, power, and other quantities
such as the fluctuation of power.
Here, we show universal lower and upper bounds of the efficiency from the
thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the entropy production and for the heat
transfers. The lower bound is characterized by the ratio between the
fluctuation of the irreversible entropy production and mean output work. The
upper bound of the efficiency is described by a generalized precision of the
heat transfers among the working substance, and hot and cold reservoirs. We
explicitly derive necessary and sufficient conditions of both the lower and
upper bounds in a unified manner in terms of fluctuation theorem. Hence, our
result provides an operating principle of the heat engine.

<h3>The Premartensite and Martensite in Fe50Rh50 System</h3>

<br>
Metallic/intermetalic materials with BCC structures hold an intrinsic
instability due to phonon softening along [110] dirrection, causing BCC to
lower-symmetry phases transformation when the BCC structures are thermally or
mechanically stressed. Fe50Rh50 binary system is one of the exceptional BCC
structures (ordered-B2) that has not been yet showing such transformation upon
application of thermal stress, although mechanical deformation results in B2 to
disordered FCC (gamma) and L10 phases transformation. Here, a comprehensive
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study is conducted on thermally-stressed
samples of Fe50Rh50 aged at water and liquid nitrogen from 1150 degree C and
1250 degree C. The results show that, samples quenched from 1150 degree C into
water and liquid nitrogen show presence of 1/4{110} and 1/2{110} satellite
reflections, the latter of which is expected from phonon dispersion curves
obtained by density functional theory calculation. Therefore, it is believed
that Fe50Rh50 maintains the B2 structure that is in premartensite state. Once
Fe50Rh50 is quenched from 1250 degree C into liquid nitrogen, formation of two
short-range ordered tetragonal phases with various c/a ratios (~1.15 and 1.4)
is observed in line with phases formed from mechanically deformed (30%) sample.
According to our observations, an accurate atomistic shear model ({110}<1-10>)
is presented that describes the martensitic transformation of B2 to these
tetragonal phases. These findings offer implications useful for understanding
of magnetic and physical characteristics of metallic/intermetallic materials.

<h3>Exploring the interrelation between Urbach energy and Fano-type  asymmetric Raman line shape in GO-hBN nanocomposites</h3>

This paper reports a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches
to find a significant correlation between Urbach energy (Eu) and asymmetry
parameter (q) of Raman mode in GO-hBN nanocomposite. The experiment involves
liquid phase exfoliation synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and GO-hBN
nanocomposite with varying hBN and graphene oxide (GO) ratios. We study the
electron-phonon interaction (EPI) strength in the nanocomposites via UV-Vis
absorption and Raman spectroscopic analysis. The induced disorders in the
nanocomposites due to varying compositions of hBN and GO have been quantified
by Eu. Simultaneously, the EPI contribution to the induced disorders is
measured via UV-Vis absorption spectra and represented as Ee-p. The EPI impact
is also observed in Raman phonon modes and quantified as an asymmetry parameter
(q). The inverse of the asymmetry parameter provides electron-phonon
interaction strength (Ee-p), i.e. Ee-p ~ 1/|q|. A lower value of q indicates
more substantial interference between electronic and phononic scattering in the
nanocomposites, thus justifying the presence of more disorders, which has also
been quantified by Eu. A linear relationship has been observed between Eu and
the proportional parameter (k), where k involves both asymmetry parameter q and
intensity of specific Raman mode (I).

<h3>An intermediate phase between jammed and un-jammed amorphous solids</h3>

A significant amount of attention was dedicated in recent years to the
phenomenon of jamming of athermal amorphous solids by increasing the volume
fraction of the microscopic constituents. At a critical value of the volume
fraction, pressure shoots up from zero to finite values with a host of critical
exponents discovered and discussed. In this letter, we advance evidence for the
existence of a second transition, within the jammed state of two-dimensional
granular systems, that separates two phases characterized by different
mechanical screening regimes. Explicitly, highly packed systems are
quasi-elastic with quadrupole-screening, and more loosely jammed systems
exhibit anomalous mechanics with dipole screening. Evidence is given for a
clear transition between these two regimes, reminiscent of the intermediate
hexatic phase of crystal melting in two-dimensional crystals.

Machine-learning potentials provide computationally efficient and accurate
approximations of the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface. This potential
determines many materials properties and simulation techniques usually require
its gradients, in particular forces and stress for molecular dynamics, and heat
flux for thermal transport properties. Recently developed potentials feature
high body order and can include equivariant semi-local interactions through
message-passing mechanisms. Due to their complex functional forms, they rely on
automatic differentiation (AD), overcoming the need for manual implementations
or finite-difference schemes to evaluate gradients. This study demonstrates a
unified AD approach to obtain forces, stress, and heat flux for such
potentials, and provides a model-independent implementation. The method is
tested on the Lennard-Jones potential, and then applied to predict cohesive
properties and thermal conductivity of tin selenide using an equivariant
message-passing neural network potential.

Recently, topologically nontrivial polarization textures have been predicted
and observed in nanoscale systems. While these polarization textures are
interesting and promising in terms of applications, their topology in general
is yet to be fully understood. For example, the relation between topological
polarization structures and band topology has not been explored, and polar
domain structures are typically considered in topologically trivial systems. In
particular, the local polarization in a crystal supercell is not well-defined,
and typically calculated using approximations which do not satisfy gauge
invariance. Furthermore, local polarization in supercells is typically
approximated using calculations involving smaller unit cells, meaning the
connection to the electronic structure of the supercell is lost. In this work,
we propose a definition of local polarization which is gauge invariant and can
be calculated directly from a supercell without approximations. We show using
first-principles calculations for commensurate bilayer hexagonal boron nitride
that our expressions for local polarization give the correct result at the unit
cell level, which is a first approximation to the local polarization in a
moir\'e superlattice. We also illustrate using an effective model that the
local polarization can be directly calculated in real space. Finally, we
discuss the relation between polarization and band topology, for which it is
essential to have a correct definition of polarization textures.

<h3>Crystal Thermal Transport in Altermagnetic RuO2</h3>

<br>

We demonstrate the emergence of a pronounced thermal transport in the
recently discovered class of magnetic materials-altermagents. From symmetry
arguments and first principles calculations performed for the showcase
altermagnet, RuO2, we uncover that crystal Nernst and crystal thermal Hall
effects in this material are very large and strongly anisotropic with respect
to the Neel vector. We find the large crystal thermal transport to originate
from three sources of Berry's curvature in momentum space: the pseudo-nodal
surfaces, the Weyl fermions due to crossings between well-separated bands, and
the spin-flip ladder transitions, defined by transitions among very weakly
spin-split states of similar dispersion crossing the Fermi surface. Moreover,
we reveal that the anomalous thermal and electrical transport coefficients in
RuO2 are linked by an extended Wiedemann-Franz law in a temperature range much
wider than expected for conventional magnets. Our results suggest that
altermagnets may assume a leading role in realizing concepts in
spincaloritronics not achievable with ferromagnets or antiferromagnets.

<h3>Distinct quasiparticle interference patterns for surface impurity  scattering on various Weyl semimetals</h3>

We examine the response of the Fermi arc in the context of quasi-particle
interference (QPI) with regard to a localized surface impurity on various
three-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Our study also reveals the variation
of the local density of states (LDOS), obtained by Fourier transforming the QPI
profile, on the two-dimensional surface. We use the $T$-matrix formalism to
numerically (analytically and numerically) capture the details of the momentum
space scattering in QPI (real space decay in LDOS), considering relevant
tight-binding lattice and/or low-energy continuum models modeling a range of
different WSMs. In particular, we consider multi-WSM (mWSM), hosting multiple
Fermi arcs between two opposite chirality Weyl nodes (WNs), where we find a
universal $1/r$-decay ($r$ measuring the radial distance from the impurity
core) of the impurity-induced LDOS, irrespective of the topological charge.
Interestingly, the inter-Fermi arc scattering is only present for triple WSMs,
where we find an additional $1/r^3$-decay as compared to double and single
WSMs. The untilted single (double) [triple] WSM shows a straight-line
(leaf-like) [oval-shaped] QPI profile. The above QPI profiles are canted for
hybrid WSMs where type-I and type-II Weyl nodes coexist, however, hybrid single
WSM demonstrates strong non-uniformity, unlike the hybrid double and triple
WSMs. We also show that the chirality and the positions of the Weyl nodes
imprint marked signatures in the QPI profile. This allows us to distinguish
between different WSMs, including the time-reversal-broken WSMs from the
time-reversal-invariant WSM, even though both of the WSMs can host two pairs of
Weyl nodes. Our study can thus shed light on experimentally obtainable complex
QPI profiles and help differentiate different WSMs and their surface band
structures.

formalism for interpolating causal matrix-valued functions and is applicable to
various many-body methods, including dynamical mean field theory, its cluster

Employing the original, all-optical method, we quantify the magnetic
susceptibility of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined in the
MoSe$_2$ monolayer in the range of low and moderate carrier densities. The
impact of electron-electron interactions on the 2DEG magnetic susceptibility is
found to be particularly strong in the limit of, studied in detail, low carrier
densities. Following the existing models, we derive $g_0 = 2.5 \pm 0.4$ for the
bare (single particle) g-factor of the ground state electronic band in the
MoSe$_2$ monolayer. The derived value of this parameter is discussed in the
context of estimations from other experimental approaches. Surprisingly, the
conclusions drawn differ from theoretical ab-initio studies.

Carbon nitrides have recently come into focus for photo- and thermal
catalysis, both as support materials for metal nanoparticles as well as
photocatalysts themselves. While many approaches for the synthesis of
three-dimensional carbon nitride materials are available, only top-down
approaches by exfoliation of powders lead to thin film flakes of this
inherently two-dimensional material. Here, we describe an in situ on-surface
synthesis of monolayer 2D carbon nitride films, as a first step towards precise
combination with other 2D materials. Starting with a single monomer precursor,
we show that 2,5,8-triazido-s-heptazine (TAH) can be evaporated intact,
deposited on a single crystalline Au(111) or graphite support, and activated
via azide decomposition and subsequent coupling to form a covalent
polyheptazine network. We demonstrate that the activation can occur in three
pathways, via electrons (X-ray illumination), photons (UV illumination) and
thermally. Our work paves the way to coat materials with extended carbon
nitride networks which are, as we show, stable under ambient conditions.

<br>
<br>
We study the escape behavior of a lamb to safe haven pursued by a hungry
lion. Identifying the system with a pair of vicious Brownian walkers we
evaluate the probability density function for the vicious pair and from there
we estimate the distribution of first passage times. The process ends in two
ways: either the lamb makes it to the safe haven (success) or is captured by
the lion (failure). We find that the conditional distribution for both success
and failure possesses a finite mean, but no higher moments exist. This makes it
interesting to study these first passage properties of this Bernoulli process
under restarts, which we do via Poissonian and sharp restart protocols. We find
that under both restart protocols the probability of success exhibits a
monotonic dependence on the restart parameters, however, their approach to the
case without restarts is completely different. The distribution of first
passage times exhibits an exponential decay for the two restart protocols. In
addition, the distribution under sharp resetting also exhibits a periodic
behavior, following the periodicity of the sharp restart protocol itself.

Conformal symmetry governs the behavior of closed systems near second-order
phase transitions, and is expected to emerge in open systems going through
dissipative phase transitions. We propose a framework allowing for a manifest
description of conformal symmetry in open Markovian systems. The key difference
from the closed case is that both conformal algebra and the algebra of local
fields are realized on the space of superoperators. We illustrate the framework
by a series of examples featuring systems with quadratic Hamiltonians and
linear jump operators, where the Liouvillian dynamics can be efficiently
analyzed using the formalism of third quantization. We expect that our
framework can be extended to interacting systems using an appropriate
generalization of the conformal bootstrap.

<br>
<br>
Superionic conductivity, or conductivity that rivals or exceeds those of the
liquid phase (0.01 S/cm), is predicted to be possible through couplings between
the mobile ion and the phonon vibrations of the crystal lattice. However, few
experimental techniques have directly probed the many-body phonon modes that
enable superionic conductivity. In this work, we develop a laser-driven
impedance technique to measure the relative contribution of specific phonon
modes to ion migration in a solid-state electrolyte Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO).
Through ab initio calculations, we find that a few collective phonon-ion modes,
mostly TiO6 rocking modes in the <6 Terahertz (THz) range, provide more than
40% of the energy required for the ion hop in the LLTO lattice. Next, we
experimentally measure the change in impedance of LLTO using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) while driving the TiO6 octahedral rocking modes
with THz radiation. In agreement with our ab initio theoretical calculations
and molecular dynamics simulations, experimentally exciting these rocking modes
decreases the measured impedance ten-fold compared to exciting the acoustic and
optical phonon bath at similar populations or heating LLTO. The decreased
impedance also persists longer than the driving light. Our newly developed
experiments can quantify phonon-ion coupling in multiple classes of ion
conductors and suggest the potential for metastable states for opto-ionic
materials.

We investigate the orbital Hall effect through a disordered mesoscopic device
with momentum-space orbital texture that is connected to four semi-infinite
terminals embedded in the Landauer-B\"uttiker configuration for quantum
transport. We present clear analytical and numerical evidence that the orbital
Hall current fluctuations are universals (as with spin Hall current
fluctuations). The universal orbital Hall current fluctuations (UOCF) exhibit
two universal numbers of 0.36 and 0.18 for weak and strong spin-orbit coupling,
respectively. The universal numbers are obtained by analytical calculation via
random matrix theory and are supported by numerical calculations based on the
tight-binding model. Furthermore, the UOCF lead to two universal relationships
between the orbital Hall angle and conductivity. Finally, we confront the two
universal relations with experimental data of the orbital Hall angle, which
shows good concordance between theory and experiment.
