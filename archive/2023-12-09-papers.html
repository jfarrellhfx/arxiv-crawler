<h3>Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and Generalised Hydrodynamics in the  sine-Gordon model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03909</a>
<br>
<i>B. C. Nagy, G. Takács, M. Kormos</i>
<p>We set up a hydrodynamic description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of
sine-Gordon quantum field theory for generic coupling. It is built upon an
explicit form of the Bethe Ansatz description of general thermodynamic states,
with the structure of the resulting coupled integral equations encoded in terms
of graphical diagrams. The resulting framework is applied to derive results for
the Drude weights of charge and energy. Quantities associated with the charge
universally have fractal dependence on the coupling, which is notably absent
from those associated with energy, a feature explained by the different roles
played by reflective scattering in transporting these quantities. We then
present far-from-equilibrium results, including explicit time evolution
starting from bipartite initial states and dynamical correlation functions. Our
framework can be applied to explore numerous other aspects of non-equilibrium
dynamics, which opens the way to a wide array of theoretical studies and
potential novel experimental predictions.

<h3>Thermal and electrostatic tuning of surface phonon-polaritons in  LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03711</a>

<p>Phonon polaritons are promising for infrared applications due to a strong
light-matter coupling and subwavelength energy confinement they offer. Yet, the
spectral narrowness of the phonon bands and difficulty to tune the phonon
polariton properties hinder further progress in this field. SrTiO3 - a
prototype perovskite oxide - has recently attracted attention due to two
prominent far-infrared phonon polaritons bands, albeit without any tuning
reported so far. Here we show, using cryogenic infrared near-field microscopy,
that long-propagating surface phonon polaritons are present both in bare SrTiO3
and in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures hosting a two-dimensional electron gas.
The presence of the two-dimensional electron gas increases dramatically the
thermal variation of the upper limit of the surface phonon polariton band due
to temperature dependent polaronic screening of the surface charge carriers.
Furthermore, we demonstrate a tunability of the upper surface phonon polariton
frequency in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 via electrostatic gating. Our results suggest that
oxide interfaces are a new platform bridging unconventional electronics and
long-wavelength nanophotonics.

<p>The magnetoelectric (ME) effects are caused by interactions of the electrical
and magnetic subsystems in a solid. Among the applications of ME effects, there
are methods of magnetic reversal under the influence of an electrostatic field
and the reverse effect. As a result of the theoretical studies carried out in
this thesis, we obtained a complete symmetry classification of all the main
micromagnetic structures (domain walls, Bloch lines, Bloch points, and magnetic
vortices/skyrmions), where the structures were first divided by their magnetic
chirality. The organic connection of this classification with the inhomogeneous
magnetoelectric effects in them has been shown. The inhomogeneous ME effect is
qualitatively described for each symmetry class. Additionally, the known
phenomenological theory of these effects is extended to the cases of crystals
of cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic systems. The obtained results were
analyzed for their compatibility with the existing experimental facts, and the
possibility of detecting new phenomena has been suggested.

<h3>Measuring the Kapitza Resistance between a Passivated Semiconductor and  Liquid Helium</h3>

<p>In this paper, we describe an experimental investigation into the effect of
passivation layer thickness on heat dissipation between a quartz substrate and
liquid helium. We have observed that by depositing SiN from 0 to 240 nm, the
Kapitza resistance increases by 0.0365 m^2.K/W per nanometer more than for an
unpassivated semiconductor. We hypothesize that this increase in Kapitza
resistance represents an additional barrier to the cooling of semiconductor
devices in liquid helium.

<h3>Spectral holographic trapping: Creating dynamic force landscapes with  polyphonic waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03794" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03794</a>
<br>
<i>Mia C. Morrell, Julianne Lee, David G. Grier</i>
<p>Acoustic trapping uses forces exerted by sound waves to transport small
objects along specified trajectories in three dimensions. The structure of the
acoustic force landscape is governed by the amplitude and phase profiles of the
sound's pressure wave. These profiles can be controlled through deliberate
spatial modulation of monochromatic waves, by analogy to holographic optical
trapping. Alternatively, spatial and temporal control can be achieved by
interfering a small number of sound waves at multiple frequencies to create
acoustic holograms based on spectral content. We demonstrate spectral
holographic trapping by projecting acoustic conveyor beams that move
millimeter-scale objects along prescribed paths, and control the complexity of
particle trajectories by tuning the strength of weak reflections. Illustrative
spectral superpositions of static and dynamic force landscapes enable us to
realize two variations on the theme of a wave-driven oscillator, a deceptively
simple dynamical system with surprisingly complex phenomenology.

<h3>Nonequilibrium diagrammatic many-body simulations with quantics tensor  trains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03809" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03809</a>
<br>
<i>Matthias Murray, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Philipp Werner</i>
<p>The nonequilibrium Green's function formalism provides a versatile and
powerful framework for numerical studies of nonequilibrium phenomena in
correlated many-body systems. For calculations starting from an equilibrium
initial state, a standard approach consists of discretizing the Kadanoff-Baym
contour and implementing a causal time-stepping scheme in which the self-energy
of the system plays the role of a memory kernel. This approach becomes
computationally expensive at long times, because of the convolution integrals
and the large amount of computer memory needed to store the Green's functions.
A recent idea for the compression of nonequilibrium Green's functions is the
quantics tensor train representation. Here, we explore this approach by
implementing equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations of the two-dimensional
Hubbard model with a second-order weak-coupling approximation to the
self-energy. We show that calculations with compressed two-time functions are
possible without any loss of accuracy, and that the quantics tensor train
implementation shows a much improved scaling of the computational effort and
memory demand with the length of the time contour.

<h3>A theory for the low-energy optical sum-rule in moiré graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03819</a>
<br>

<p>Few layers of graphene at small twist-angles have emerged as a fascinating
platform for studying the problem of strong interactions in regimes with a
nearly quenched single-particle kinetic energy and non-trivial band topology.
Starting from the strong-coupling limit of twisted bilayer graphene with a
vanishing single-electron bandwidth and interlayer-tunneling between the same
sublattice sites, we present an ${\it exact}$ analytical theory of the Coulomb
interaction-induced low-energy optical spectral weight at all ${\it integer}$
fillings. In this limit, while the interaction-induced single-particle
dispersion is finite, the optical spectral weight vanishes identically at
integer fillings. We study corrections to the optical spectral weight by
systematically including the effects of experimentally relevant strain-induced
renormalization of the single-electron bandwidth and interlayer tunnelings
between the same sublattice sites. Given the relationship between the optical
spectral weight and the diamagnetic response that controls superconducting
$T_c$, our results highlight the relative importance of specific parent
insulating phases in enhancing the tendency towards superconductivity when
doped away from integer fillings.

<h3>Competing Higher Order Topological Superconducting Phases in Triangular  Lattice Magnet-Superconductor Hybrid Systems</h3>

<i>Ka Ho Wong, Jacopo Gliozzi, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Arbaz Malik, Barry Bradlyn, Taylor L. Hughes, Dirk K. Morr</i>
<p>We demonstrate that a plethora of higher order topological phases emerge in
magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems through the interplay of a stacked
magnetic structure and an underlying triangular surface lattice; the latter
being of great current experimental interest. Such lattices offer the ability
to create three main types of edge terminations -- called $x$-, $y$- and
$y^\prime$-edges -- of MSH islands that, in turn, give rise to a complex phase
diagrams exhibiting various regions of HOTSC phases. We identify the single
adatom chain, as well as a pair of adjacent adatom chains (called a
double-chain), as the basic building blocks for the emergence of HOTSC phases.
Of particular interest are those HOTSC phase which arise from a competition
between the topology of single and double-chain blocks, which are absent for
square latices.

<h3>Dynamics of spin-momentum entanglement from superradiant phase  transitions</h3>

<p>Exploring operational regimes of many-body cavity QED with multi-level atoms
remains an exciting research frontier for their enhanced storage capabilities
of intra-level quantum correlations. In this work, we propose an extension of a
prototypical many-body cavity QED experiment from a two to a four-level
description by optically addressing a combination of momentum and spin states
of the ultracold atoms in the cavity. The resulting model comprises a pair of
Dicke Hamiltonians constructed from pseudo-spin operators, effectively
capturing two intertwined superradiant phase transitions. The phase diagram
reveals regions featuring weak and strong entangled states of spin and momentum
atomic degrees of freedom. These states exhibit different dynamical responses,
ranging from slow to fast relaxation, with the added option of persistent
entanglement temporal oscillations. We discuss the role of cavity losses in
steering the system dynamics into such entangled states and propose a readout
scheme that leverages different light polarizations within the cavity. Our work
paves the way to connect the rich variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions
that occur in many-body cavity QED to the buildup of quantum correlations in
systems with multi-level atom descriptions.

<h3>Quantum Melting of Generalized Wigner Crystals in Transition Metal  Dichalcogenide Moiré Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03828" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03828</a>
<br>
<i>Yiqing Zhou, D. N. Sheng, Eun-Ah Kim</i>
<p>Generalized Wigner Crystal (GWC) is a novel quantum phase of matter driven by
further-range interaction at fractional fillings of a lattice. The role of
further range interaction as the driver for the incompressible state is akin to
Wigner crystal. On the other hand, the significant role of commensurate filling
is akin to the Mott insulator. Recent progress in simulator platforms presents
unprecedented opportunities to investigate quantum melting in the strongly
interacting regime through synergy between theory and experiments. However, the
earlier theory literature presents diverging predictions. We study the quantum
freezing of GWC through large-scale density matrix renormalization group
simulations of a triangular lattice extended Hubbard model. We find a single
first-order phase transition between the Fermi liquid and the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ GWC state. The GWC state shows long-range
antiferromagnetic $120^\circ$ N{\'e}el order. Our results present the simplest
answers to the question of the quantum phase transition into the GWC phase and
the properties of the GWC phase.

<h3>Magnon interactions in the quantum paramagnetic phase of CoNb$_2$O$_6$</h3>

<br>
<i>Cesar A. Gallegos, A. L. Chernyshev</i>
<p>In this work, we study effects of magnon interactions in the excitation
spectrum of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ in the quantum paramagnetic phase in transverse
field, where the $1/S$ spin-wave theory exhibits unphysical divergences at the
critical field. We propose a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approach that
eliminates such unphysical singularities while preserving the integrity of the
singular threshold phenomena of magnon decay and spectrum renormalization that
are present in both theory and experiment. With the microscopic parameters
adopted from previous studies, this method yields a close quantitative
agreement with the available experimental data for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ in the
relevant regime. Insights into the general structure of the spin-anisotropic
model of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related zigzag chain materials are also provided and
a discussion of the effects of additional longitudinal field on the spectrum is
given.

<h3>Integrability, multifractality, and two-photon dynamics in disordered  Tavis-Cummings models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03833" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03833</a>
<br>
<i>Agnieszka Wierzchucka, Francesco Piazza, Pieter W. Claeys</i>
<p>The Tavis-Cummings model is a paradigmatic central-mode model where a set of
two-level quantum emitters (spins) are coupled to a collective cavity mode.
Here we study the eigenstate spectrum, its localization properties and the
effect on dynamics, focusing on the two-excitation sector relevant for
nonlinear photonics. These models admit two sources of disorder: in the
coupling between the spins and the cavity and in the energy shifts of the
individual spins. While this model was known to be exactly solvable in the
limit of a homogeneous coupling and inhomogeneous energy shifts, we here
establish the solvability in the opposite limit of a homogeneous energy shift
and inhomogeneous coupling, presenting the exact solution and corresponding
conserved quantities. We identify three different classes of eigenstates,
exhibiting different degrees of multifractality and semilocalization closely
tied to the integrable points, and study their stability to perturbations away
from these solvable points. The dynamics of the cavity occupation number away
from equilibrium, exhibiting boson bunching and a two-photon blockade, is
explicitly related to the localization properties of the eigenstates and
illustrates how these models support a collective spin description despite the
presence of disorder.

<h3>Transient localization from the interaction with quantum bosons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03840" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03840</a>
<br>
<i>H. Rammal, A. Ralko, S. Ciuchi, S. Fratini</i>
<p>We carefully revisit the electron-boson scattering problem, going beyond
popular semi-classical treatments. By providing numerically exact results valid
at finite temperatures, we demonstrate the existence of a regime of
electron-boson scattering where quantum localization processes become relevant
despite the absence of extrinsic disorder. Localization in the Anderson sense
is caused by the emergent randomness resulting from a large thermal boson
population, being effective at transient times before diffusion can set in.
Compelling evidence of this transient localization phenomenon is provided by
the observation of a distinctive displaced Drude peak (DDP) in the optical
absorption and the ensuing suppression of conductivity. Our findings identify a
general route for anomalous metallic behavior that can broadly apply in
interacting quantum matter.

<h3>Phonon screening and dissociation of excitons at finite temperatures  from first principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03841</a>
<br>
<i>Antonios M. Alvertis, Jonah B. Haber, Zhenglu Li, Christopher J. N. Coveney, Steven G. Louie, Marina R. Filip, Jeffrey B. Neaton</i>
<p>The properties of excitons, or correlated electron-hole pairs, are of
paramount importance to optoelectronic applications of materials. A central
component of exciton physics is the electron-hole interaction, which is
commonly treated as screened solely by electrons within a material. However,
nuclear motion can screen this Coulomb interaction as well, with several recent
studies developing model approaches for approximating the phonon screening to
the properties of excitons. While these model approaches tend to improve
agreement with experiment for exciton properties, they rely on several
approximations that restrict their applicability to a wide range of materials,
and thus far they have neglected the effect of finite temperatures. Here, we
develop a fully first-principles, parameter-free approach to compute the
temperature-dependent effects of phonon screening within the ab initio GW-Bethe
Salpeter equation framework. We recover previously proposed models of phonon
screening as well-defined limits of our general framework, and discuss their
validity by comparing them against our first-principles results. We develop an
efficient computational workflow and apply it to a diverse set of
semiconductors, specifically AlN, CdS, GaN, MgO and SrTiO3. We demonstrate
under different physical scenarios how excitons may be screened by multiple
polar optical or acoustic phonons, how their binding energies can exhibit
strong temperature dependence, and the ultrafast timescales on which they
dissociate into free electron-hole pairs.

<h3>"Quantum bipolaron'' superconductivity from quadratic electron-phonon  coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03844</a>
<br>
<i>Zhaoyu Han, Steven A. Kivelson, Pavel A. Volkov</i>
<p>When the electron-phonon coupling is quadratic in the phonon coordinates,
electrons can pair to form bipolarons due to zero-point fluctuations, a pure
quantum effect. We study the possible superconductivity originating from this
pairing mechanism in a minimal model and reveal that, in the strong coupling
limit, the superfluid stiffness, and hence also the critical temperature are
only mildly (polynomially) suppressed, in stark contrast to the exponential
suppression in linearly coupled electron-phonon systems. We present arguments
that this implies higher optimal $T_c$ values. We demonstrate that strong
coupling values are achieved in known materials, such as perovskites, and
discuss strategies to realize this flavor of strong-coupling superconductivity
using moir\'e superlattices.

<h3>Field-driven transition from quantum spin liquid to magnetic order in  triangular-lattice antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03879</a>
<br>
<i>Santanu Dey, Joseph Maciejko, Matthias Vojta</i>
<p>Recently several triangular-lattice magnets with delafossite structure have
been found to display spin-liquid behavior down to the lowest temperatures.
Remarkably, applying a magnetic field destroys the spin liquid which then gives
way to symmetry-breaking states, identified as semiclassical coplanar states
including a magnetization plateau at 1/3 total magnetization. Here we provide a
theoretical approach rationalizing this dichotomy, utilizing a Schwinger-boson
theory that captures both ordered and disordered magnetic phases. We show that
a zero-field spin liquid, driven by strong frustration, is naturally
destabilized in a magnetic field via spinon condensation. Symmetry-breaking
order akin to the standard triangular-lattice Heisenberg model then arises via
an order-by-disorder mechanism. We discuss implications for pertinent
experiments.

<h3>Structural Chirality and Electronic Chirality in Quantum Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03902</a>
<br>
<i>Binghai Yan</i>
<p>In chemistry and biochemistry, chirality represents the structural asymmetry
characterized by non-superimposable mirror images for a material like DNA. In
physics, however, chirality commonly refers to the spin-momentum locking of a
particle or quasiparticle in the momentum space. While seemingly disconnected,
structural chirality in molecules and crystals can drive electronic chirality
through orbital-momentum locking, i.e. chirality can be transferred from the
atomic geometry to electronic orbitals. Electronic chirality provides an
insightful understanding of the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), in
which electrons exhibit salient spin polarization after going through a chiral
material, and electric magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA), which is characterized
by the diode-like transport. It further gives rise to new phenomena, such as
anomalous circularly polarized light emission (ACPLE), in which the light
handedness relies on the emission direction. These chirality-driven effects
will generate broad impacts in fundamental science and technology applications
in spintronics, optoelectronics, and biochemistry.

<h3>Stochastic motion under nonlinear friction representing shear thinning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03931</a>
<br>
<i>Theo Lequy, Andreas M. Menzel</i>
<p>We study stochastic motion under a nonlinear frictional force that levels off
with increasing velocity. Specifically, our frictional force is of the
so-called Coulomb-tanh type. At small speed, it increases approximately
linearly with velocity, while at large speed it approaches a constant
magnitude, similarly to solid (dry, Coulomb) friction. In one spatial
dimension, a formal analogy between the associated Fokker-Planck equation and
the Schr\"odinger equation for a quantum-mechanical oscillator in a nonharmonic
P\"oschl-Teller potential is revealed. Then, the stationary velocity statistics
can be treated analytically. From such analytical considerations, we determine
associated diffusion coefficients, which we confirm by agent-based simulations.
Moreover, from such simulations and from numerically solving the associated
Fokker-Planck equation, we find that the spatial distribution function,
starting from an initial Gaussian shape, develops tails that appear exponential
at intermediate time scales. At small magnitudes of stochastic driving, the
velocity distribution resembles the case of linear friction, while at large
magnitudes it rather approaches the case of solid (dry, Coulomb) friction. The
same is true for diffusion coefficients. In a certain sense, thus interpolating
between the two extreme cases of linear friction and solid (dry, Coulomb)
friction, our approach should be useful to describe several cases of practical
relevance. For instance, a reduced increase in friction with increasing
relative speed is typical of shear-thinning behavior. Therefore, driven motion
in shear-thinning environments is one specific example to which our description
may be applied.

<h3>Emergence of isotropy in rotating turbulence of Bose-Einstein  condensates</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuto Sano, Makoto Tsubota</i>
<p>We present a study on the development of rotating turbulence in Bose-Einstein
condensates with a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii model. Turbulence is generated
by driving the lattice of quantized vortices in a harmonic potential with a
random forcing potential. As the turbulence progressed, the initial alignment
of vortices underwent slight disruptions, thereby increasing the
high-wavenumber components of the kinetic energy. In the turbulent state, the
distribution of incompressible kinetic energy exhibits milder anisotropy than
that in the initial lattice state and demonstrates a scaling behavior of
$k_z^{-2.5}$ in the direction parallel to the rotation axis. In contrast, the
compressible kinetic energy exhibits an isotropic scaling behavior at high
wavenumbers.

<h3>Heat differentiated by projection from particles' trajectories onto the  particle number-density field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03983" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03983</a>
<br>
<i>Takuya Saito, Yutaka Sumino</i>
<p>Many particles suspended in a solution have two analogous but distinct
stochastic descriptions referred to as the Langevin and Dean--Kawasaki
equations, which are based on monitoring particles' trajectories and their
number-density field, respectively. This article focuses on heat defined in the
Langevin equation proposed by Sekimoto and also analogous heat assumed in the
Dean--Kawasaki equation. Spatial projection derives the Dean--Kawasaki equation
from the Langevin equation, so that the amounts of the heat observed on the two
stochastic forms are not generally identical even in the same phenomena.
Notably, spatiotemporal resolutions are not altered in the above projection.
This difference offers an intriguing quantity reduced to the entropy of the
number density. In addition, a many-polymer system is also found to retain the
analogous formalisms of a many-colloid system when chain configurations are
embedded into hyperdimensions. Furthermore, we develop arguments about the
interpretation and applicability of the heat differences.

<p>Correlation between transmon and its composite Josephson junctions (JJ) plays
an important role in designing new types of superconducting qubits based on
quantum materials. It is desirable to have a type of device that not only
allows exploration for use in quantum information processing but also probing
intrinsic properties in the composite JJs. Here, we construct a flux-tunable 3D
transmon-type superconducting quantum circuit made of graphene as a
proof-of-concept prototype device. This 3D transmon-type device not only
enables coupling to 3D cavities for microwave probes but also permits DC
transport measurements on the same device, providing useful connections between
transmon properties and critical currents associated with JJ's properties. We
have demonstrated how flux-modulation in cavity frequency and DC critical
current can be correlated under the influence of Fraunhofer pattern of JJs in
an asymmetric SQUID. The correlation analysis was further extended to link the
flux-modulated transmon properties, such as flux-tunability in qubit and cavity
frequencies, with SQUID symmetry analysis based on DC measurements. Our study
paves the way towards integrating novel materials for exploration of new types
of quantum devices for future technology while probing underlying physics in

<h3>Oxidation tuning of ferroic transitions in Gd$_2$C monolayer</h3>

<i>Xinyu Yang, Shuai Dong</i>
<p>Tuning of ferroic phases provides great opportunities for material
functionalities, especially in two-dimensional materials. Here, a $4f$
rare-earth carbide Gd$_2$C monolayer is predicted to be ferromagnetic metal
with large magnetization, inherited from its bulk property. Based on
first-principles calculations, we propose a strategy that the surface
passivation can effectively tune its ferroicity, namely switching among
ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferroelectric phases. Metal-insulator
transition also occurs accompanying these ferroic transitions. Our calculation
also suggests that the magneto-optic Kerr effect and second harmonic generation
are effective methods to monitor these phase transitions.

<p>The condensation of paired fermions into superfluid states changes
progressively depending on the coupling strength. At the midpoint of the
crossover between Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) weak-coupling and
Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) strong-coupling limits, paired fermions
condensate most robustly, thereby leading to the emergence of a pseudogap due
to enhanced pairing fluctuations. In the case of electrons in solids,
excessively strong interactions often induce competing electronic orders
instead of strong-coupling superconductivity, and experimental comprehension of
the pseudogap remains incomplete. In this study, we provide experimental
evidence demonstrating the opening of a pseudogap, marking the incipient stage
of the BCS-BEC crossover in the organic system $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$$X$. By
controlling electron correlations, we investigate the thermodynamic properties
of the BCS-BEC crossover and pseudogap phase. Since the superconductivity of
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$$X$ arises from a simple Fermi liquid that does not
exhibit any other electronic orders, our study shed light on the inherent
nature of the BCS-BEC crossover.

<h3>Frustration-Mediated Crossover from Long-Range to Short-Range Magnetic  Ordering in $\mathbf{Y_{1-x}Lu_xBaCo_4O_7} $</h3>

<i>Sevda Sahinbay, Hong Zheng, John F. Mitchell, Stephan Rosenkranz, Omar Chmaissem</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive magnetic and structural phase diagram for
$\mathrm{Y_{1-x}Lu_xBaCo_4O_7}$, established through neutron diffraction and
magnetization measurements. Our results outline the evolution of various
nuclear structures, encompassing both orthorhombic and monoclinic symmetries,
in response to changes in composition and temperature. The phase transition
temperature of the orthorhombic phase, $T_{s1}$, decreases with increasing Lu
content from 310 K for x = 0.0 to 110 K for x = 1.0. In Lu-rich compositions
(0.7 \le x \le 1.0), first-order structural transitions are observed with
coexisting and competing orthorhombic Pbn$2_1$ and metastable monoclinic Cc
phases. Composition- and temperature-dependent refinements of the magnetic
structure reveal an antiferromagnetic arrangement of Co spin pairs, below the
magnetic transition temperatures of the Y-rich compositions, in the ab plane
within both the triangular and Kagom\'e layers. A gradual suppression of
long-range magnetic order is observed with increasing the Lu content,
accompanied by the development of short-range magnetic correlations present in
all the samples.

<h3>Conformal Operator Content of the Wilson-Fisher Transition on Fuzzy  Sphere Bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04047</a>
<br>
<i>Chao Han, Liangdong Hu, W. Zhu</i>
<p>The Wilson-Fisher criticality provides a paradigm for a large class of phase
transitions in nature (e.g., helium, ferromagnets). In the three dimension,
Wilson-Fisher critical points are not exactly solvable due to the
strongly-correlated feature, so one has to resort to non-perturbative tools
such as numerical simulations. Here, we design a microscopic model of
Heisenberg magnet bilayer and study the underlying Wilson-Fisher
$\mathrm{O}(3)$ transition through the lens of fuzzy sphere regularization. We
uncover a wealth of crucial information which directly reveals the emergent
conformal symmetry regarding this fixed point. In specific, we accurately
calculate and analyze the energy spectra at the transition, and explicitly
identify the existence of a conserved Noether current, a stress tensor and
relevant primary fields. Most importantly, the primaries and their descendants
form a fingerprint conformal tower structure, pointing to an almost perfect
state-operator correspondence. Furthermore, by examining the leading rank-4
symmetric tensor operator, we demonstrate the cubic perturbation is relevant,
implying the critical $\mathrm{O}(3)$ model is unstable to cubic anisotropy, in
agreement with the renormalization group and bootstrap calculations. The
successful dissection of conformal content of the Wilson-Fisher universality
class extends the horizon of the fuzzy sphere method and paves the way for
exploring higher dimensional conformal field theories.

<h3>Dissipationless gyrotropic magnetic Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04093" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04093</a>
<br>
<i>Longjun Xiang, Jinxiong Jia, Fuming Xu, Zhenhua Qiao, Jian Wang</i>
<p>A dissipationless longitudinal current can be generated by a pure magnetic
field through the chiral magnetic effect. Herein, we propose that a pure
oscillating magnetic field through Zeeman coupling can further drive an AC
magnetic Hall current in two-dimensional systems without inversion symmetry. We
dub this effect the "gyrotropic magnetic Hall effect" (GMHE), in analogy with
the gyrotropic current achieved by rectifying the optical fields. Importantly,
we find that the GMHE conductivity is a reactive or dissipationless transport
coefficient, which is even under time-reversal symmetry. We reveal the "Zeeman
Berry curvature" as the quantum origin of the GMHE, whose integral over all
states below the Fermi energy gives the GMHE conductivity. Furthermore, by
symmetry analysis, we show that the GMHE can appear in a wide range of
two-dimensional materials. To demonstrate our proposal, we evaluate the GMHE
current in two-dimensional Rashba system and in the surface of topological
insulator, where a low-frequency magnetic field with a small amplitude can be
converted into a detectable Hall voltage.

<br>
<i>V. V. Enaldiev</i>
<p>Long-period moir\'e superlattices at the twisted interface of van der Waals
heterostructures relax into preferential-stacking domains separated by
dislocation networks. Here, we develop a mesoscale theory for dislocations in
the networks formed in twistronic bilayers with parallel (P) and antiparallel
(AP) alignment of unit cells across the twisted interface. For P bilayers we
find an exact analytical displacement field across partial dislocations and
determine analytic dependences of energy per unit length and width on
orientation and microscopic model parameters. For AP bilayers we formulate a
semi-analytical approximation for displacement fields across perfect
dislocations, establishing parametric dependences for their widths and energies
per unit length. In addition, we find regions in parametric space of crystal
thicknesses and moir\'e periods for strong and weak relaxation of moir\'e
pattern in multilayered twistronic heterostructures.

<br>
<i>Tengzhou Zhang, Zi Cai</i>
<p>In this study, we propose an exotic quantum liquid state which does not order
at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By
performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we
investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a clean system
without frustration, and find that the wavefunction of its ground state is
composed of configurations with fractal branching structures. This state
features a quasi-long-range order (correlation functions with algebraic decay)
as well as a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. Thus it is
different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.

<i>Dong Fan, Supriyo Naskar, Guillaume Maurin</i>
<p>CALF-20 was recently identified as a novel benchmark sorbent for CO$_2$
capture at the industrial scale, however comprehensive atomistic insight into
its mechanical/thermal properties under working conditions is still lacking. In
this study, we developed a general-purpose machine-learned potential (MLP) for
the CALF-20 MOF framework that predicts the thermodynamic and mechanical
properties of the structure at finite temperatures within first-principles
accuracy. Interestingly, CALF-20 was demonstrated to exhibit both negative area
compression and negative thermal expansion. Most strikingly, upon application
of the tensile strain along the [001] direction, CALF-20 was shown to display a
distinct two-step elastic deformation behavior, unlike typical MOFs that
undergo plastic deformation after elasticity. Furthermore, this MOF was shown
to exhibit a spectacular fracture strain of up to 27% along the [001] direction
at room temperature comparable to that of MOF glasses. These abnormal thermal
and mechanical properties make CALF-20 as attractive material for flexible and
stretchable electronics and sensors.

<h3>First Principles Investigation on Structural and Optoelectronic  Properties of newly designed Janus Lead Halides PbXY (X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I )</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04122" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04122</a>
<br>
<i>Anjana E Sudheer, Golla Tejaswini, D Murali, Matthias Posselt</i>
<p>Here, we design a novel class of Janus structures PbXY(X,Y = F, Cl, Br, I)
and propose it for the solar mediated photocatalytic water splitting hydrogen
production as well as for the photovoltaic solarcell applications. Charge
analysis shows that covalent bonding for less electronegative atoms and ionic
bonding for more electronegative atoms. Strong dual bonding like ionic one side
and covalent other side is observed when heavy and lighter atoms are part of
the same Janus structures. The as designed Janus structures show good dynamical
stability through phonon calculations. Basic electronic structure using
Generalised Gradient Approximation(GGA) reveal both direct and indirect nature
of band gap with large tunability. Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) electronic
structure calculations are performed and wider band gaps are predicted for
these Janus structures. The calculated effective masses of charge carriers show
robust charge carrier dynamics. The orbital resolved electronic density of
states (DOS) shows that the conduction band edge is composed of pz orbital of
Pb atom. The partialcharge density calculated at conduction band minimum (CBM)
also support the result obtained from PDOS analysis. Breaking of
centrosymmetry, polarization in the out of plane direction, the z-oriented
orbitals of CBM all points that these materials are suitable for shift current
generation. The calculated optical absorption spectra show that the Janus
structures are suitable for visible light absorption. The calculated potential
difference between the top and bottom layer show significant variation and
maximum (1.02 eV) is observed for PbClF. Further, we show that combining both
potential difference and HSE bandgap, valence band maximum(VBM) and CBM
straddle the water redox potentials, thus making the Janus structures suitable
for water redox reactions.

<h3>Attenuation of flexural phonons in free-standing crystalline  two-dimensional materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04138</a>
<br>
<i>A. D. Kokovin, I. S. Burmistrov</i>
<p>We develop the theory for dynamics of the out-of-plane deformations in
flexible two-dimensional materials. We focus on study of attenuation of
flexural phonons in free-standing crystalline membranes. We demonstrate that
the dynamical renormalization does not involve the ultraviolet divergent
logarithmic contributions contrary to the static ones. This fact allows us to
find the scaling form of the attenuation, determine its small and large
frequency asymptotes, and to derive the exact expression for the dynamical
exponent of flexural phonons in the long wave limit: $\textsf{z}{=}2{-}\eta/2$.
Here $\eta$ is the universal exponent controlling the static renormalization of
the bending rigidity. Also we determine the dynamical exponent for the
long-wave in-plane phonons: $\textsf{z}^\prime{=}(2{-}\eta)/(1{-}\eta/2)$. We
discuss implication of our results to experiments on phonon spectra in graphene
and dynamics of graphene-based nanomechanical resonators.

<h3>Narrowing of the flexural phonon spectral line in stressed crystalline  two-dimensional materials</h3>

<br>
<i>A. D. Kokovin, V. Yu. Kachorovskii, I. S. Burmistrov</i>
<p>We develop the microscopic theory for the attenuation of out-of-plane phonons
in stressed flexible two-dimensional crystalline materials. We demonstrate that
the presence of nonzero tension strongly reduces the relative magnitude of the
attenuation and, consequently, results in parametrical narrowing of the
phononspectral line. We predict the specific power-law dependence of the
spectral-line width on temperature and tension. We speculate that suppression
of the phonon attenuation by nonzero tension might be responsible for high
quality factors of mechanical nanoresonators based on flexural two-dimensional
materials.

<h3>High-throughput study of the phase constitution of the thin film system  Mg-Mn-Al-O in relation to Li recovery from slags</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04146</a>
<br>
<i>Florian Lourens, Ellen Suhr, Alena Schnickmann, Thomas Schirmer, Alfred Ludwig</i>
<p>The increasing importance of recycling makes the recovery of valuable
elements from slags interesting, e.g., by the concept of engineered artificial
minerals (EnAMs). In this concept, it is aimed for the formation of EnAMs,
meaning phase(s) with a high content of the to-be-recovered element(s) from
slags of pyrometallurgical recycling processes. For this, understanding the
phase constitution of the slag systems is of high importance. The system
Mg-Mn-Al-O is a metal oxide slag subsystem from Li-ion battery recycling, that
is critical for the formation of spinel phases, which are competing phases to
the possible Li-containing EnAM phase LiAlO2. Here, the phase constitution was
investigated using a thin film materials library that covers the composition
space (Mg14-69Mn11-38Al14-74)Ox. By means of high-throughput energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, the formation of the spinel solid
solution phase was confirmed for a wide composition space. Increasing
preferential orientation of the spinel solid solution along (400) with
increasing Mg content was identified. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used
to measure the near-surface composition of selected areas of the materials
library, and detailed peak fitting of the Mn 2p3/2 region revealed the Mn
oxidation state to be a mixture of Mn2+ and Mn3+. For one measurement area of
the materials library containing equal atomic amounts of Mg, Mn and Al,
transmission electron microscopy showed that the approximately 420 nm-thick
film consists of columnar spinel grains with Mg, Mn and Al being evenly
distributed. Based on these results, we suggest that the shown high likelihood
of spinel formation in slags might be influenced by controlling the Mn
oxidation state to enable the formation of desirable EnAM phases.

<h3>Total energy beyond GW : exact results and guidelines for approximations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04154</a>
<br>
<i>Abdallah El-Sahili, Francesco Sottile, Lucia Reining</i>
<p>The total energy and electron addition and removal spectra can in principle
be obtained exactly from the one-body Green's function. In practice, the
Green's function is obtained from an approximate self-energy. In the framework
of many-body perturbation theory, we derive different expressions that are
based on an approximate self-energy, but that yield nevertheless in principle
the exact exchange-correlation contribution to the total energy for any
interaction strength. Response functions play a crucial role, which explains
why, for example, ingredients from time-dependent density functional theory can
be used to build these approximate self-energies. We show that the key
requirement for obtaining exact results is the consistent combination of
ingredients. Also when further approximations are made, as it is necessary in
practice, this consistency remains the key to obtain good results. All findings
are illustrated using the exactly solvable symmetric Hubbard dimer.

<h3>Possible gapless helical edge states in hydrogenated graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Yong-Cheng Jiang, Toshikaze Kariyado, Xiao Hu</i>
<p>Electronic band structures in hydrogenated graphene are theoretically
investigated by means of first-principle calculations and an effective
tight-binding model. It is shown that regularly designed hydrogenation to
graphene gives rise to a large band gap about 1 eV. Remarkably, by changing the
spatial pattern of the hydrogenation, topologically distinct states can be
realized, where the topological nontriviality is detected by $C_2$ parity
indices in bulk and confirmed by the existence of gapless edge/interface states
as protected by the mirror and sublattice symmetries. The analysis of the wave
functions reveals that the helical edge states in hydrogenated graphene with
the appropriate design carry pseudospin currents that are reminiscent of the
quantum spin Hall effect. Our work shows the potential of hydrogenated graphene
in pseudospin-based device applications.

<h3>Probing levitodynamics with multi-stochastic forces and the simple  applications on the dark matter detection in optical levitation experiment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04202" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04202</a>
<br>
<i>Xi Cheng, Ji-Heng Guo, Wenyu Wang, Bin Zhu</i>
<p>If the terrestrial environment is permeated by dark matter, the levitation
experiences damping forces and fluctuations attributed to dark matter. This
paper investigates levitodynamics with multiple stochastic forces, including
thermal drag, photon recoil, feedback, etc., assuming that all of these forces
adhere to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ratio of total damping to
the stochastic damping coefficient distinguishes the levitodynamics from cases
involving only one single stochastic force. The heating and cooling processes
are formulated to determine the limits of temperature change. All sources of
stochastic forces are comprehensively examined, revealing that dark matter
collisions cannot be treated analogously to fluid dynamics. Additionally, a
meticulous analysis is presented, elucidating the intricate relationship
between the fundamental transfer cross-section and the macroscopic transfer
cross-section. While the dark damping coefficient is suppressed by the mass of
the levitated particle, scattering can be coherently enhanced based on the
scale of the component microscopic particle, the atomic form factor, and the
static structure factor. Hence, dark damping holds the potential to provide
valuable insights into the detection of the macroscopic strength of fundamental
particles. We propose experimental procedures for levitation and employ linear
estimation to extract the dark damping coefficient. Utilizing current
levitation results, we demonstrate that the fundamental transfer cross section
of dark matter can be of the order $\sigma^{\rm D}_{T}\lsim {\cal
O}(10^{-26})\rm cm^2$.

<h3>Evidence of charge transfer in a bilayer film, LaSrMnO3/YBa2Cu3O7</h3>

<i>Ankita Singh, Sawani Datta, Ram Prakash Pandeya, Srinivas C. Kandukuri, Kalobaran Maiti</i>
<p>We study the growth and electronic properties of a high temperature
superconductor, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) in proximity of a magnetic material,
La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO). High quality single crystalline films of
YBCO and LSMO/YBCO were grown epitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ (001) surface.
Magnetization data of the LSMO/YBCO bilayer exhibit ferromagnetic ordering with
Curie temperature smaller than that of pure LSMO. Measurements at different
field directions reveal emergence of an anisotropy at low temperatures with
in-plane easy axis; the observed anisotropy is stronger in the superconducting
region. Magnetization data of YBCO exhibit onset of diamagnetism at 86 K for
the out-of-plane magnetic measurements while the in-plane measurements show
onset at a slightly higher temperature of 89 K with much smaller moment.
Interestingly, the onset of diamagnetism in LSMO/YBCO film remains at 86 K
despite the presence of ferromagnetic LSMO layer underneath. The analysis of Ba
4$d$ and Y 3$d$ core level spectra suggest that the surface and bulk electronic
structure in these systems are different; the difference is reduced
significantly in the LSMO/YBCO sample suggesting an enhancement of electron
density near the surface arising from the charge transfer across the interface,
which is consistent with the magnetization data.

<h3>Accurate Distances Measures and Machine Learning of the Texture-Property  Relation for Crystallographic Textures Represented by One-Point Statistics</h3>

<p>The crystallographic texture of metallic materials is a key microstructural
feature that is responsible for the anisotropic behavior, e.g., important in
forming operations. In materials science, crystallographic texture is commonly
described by the orientation distribution function, which is defined as the
probability density function of the orientations of the monocrystal grains
conforming a polycrystalline material. For representing the orientation
distribution function, there are several approaches such as using generalized
spherical harmonics, orientation histograms, and pole figure images . Measuring
distances between crystallographic textures is essential for any task that
requires assessing texture similarities, e.g. to guide forming processes.
Therefore, we introduce novel distance measures based on (i) the Earth Movers
Distance that takes into account local distance information encoded in
histogram-based texture representations and (ii) a distance measure based on
pole figure images. For this purpose, we evaluate and compare existing distance
measures for selected use-cases. The present study gives insights into
advantages and drawbacks of using certain texture representations and distance
measures with emphasis on applications in materials design and optimal process
control.

<h3>A Mott-Schottky Analysis of Mesoporous Silicon in Aqueous Electrolyte by  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<i>Manuel Brinker, Patrick Huber</i>
<p>Nanoporosity in silicon leads to completely new functionalities of this
mainstream semiconductor. In recent years, it has been shown that filling the
pores with aqueous electrolytes in addition opens a particularly wide field for
modifying and achieving active control of these functionalities, e.g., for
electrochemo-mechanical actuation and tunable photonics, or for the design of
on-chip supercapacitors. However, a mechanistic understanding of these new
features has been hampered by the lack of a detailed characterization of the
electrochemical behavior of mesoporous silicon in aqueous electrolytes. Here,
the capacitive, potential-controlled charging of the electrical double layer in
a mesoporous silicon electrode (pore diameter $7\,\mathrm{nm}$) imbibed with
perchloric acid solution is studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Thorough measurements with detailed explanations of the observed phenomena lead
to a comprehensive understanding of the capacitive properties of porous
silicon. An analysis based on the Mott-Schottky equation allows general
conclusions to be drawn about the state of the band structure within the pore
walls. Essential parameters such as the flat band potential, the doping density
and the width of the space charge region can be determined. A comparison with
bulk silicon shows that the flat band potential in particular is significantly
altered by the introduction of nanopores, as it shifts from
$1.4\pm0.1\,\mathrm{V}$ to $1.9\pm0.2\,\mathrm{V}$. Overall, this study
provides a unique insight into the electrochemical processes, especially the
electrical double layer charging, of nanoporous semiconductor electrodes.

<h3>Diffusion-Dependent Pattern Formation on Crystal Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04254</a>
<br>
<i>Marta Anna Chabowska, Magdalena A. Załuska-Kotur</i>
<p>The growth of a crystal is usually determined by its surface. Many factors
influence the growth dynamics. Energy barriers associated with the presence of
steps most often decide about the emerging pattern. The height and type of
Ehrlich-Schwoebel step barriers lead to the growth of nanocolumns, nanowires,
pyramids, and bunches or meanders in the same system. Surface diffusion is
another factor that determines the nature of growth. We used the (2+1)D
cellular automaton model to investigate the additional effect of diffusion
along with step barriers. We show that when we only change the diffusion rate,
the length of the meanders or the height of the bunches increase, while the
cracked structure of the nanopillars changes into very long, tall nanowires. We
show that the length of the step-step correlation is a good characterization of
the resulting patterns.

<h3>Nonlinear dielectric response in glasses: restoring forces and avoided  spin-glass criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04267" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04267</a>
<br>
<i>Eric Bertin, François Ladieu</i>
<p>Experimental measurements of nonlinear dielectric response in glassformers
like supercooled glycerol or propylene carbonate have been interpreted as
providing evidence for a growing thermodynamic length scale when lowering
temperature. A heuristic picture based on coherently flipping `superdipoles'
with disordered internal structure has been argued to capture the essence of
the experimentally reported behavior, pointing to the key role of effectively
disordered interactions in structural glasses. We test these ideas by devising
an explicit one-dimensional model of interacting spins incorporating both the
spin-glass spirit of the superdipole argument, and the necessary long-time
decorrelation of structural disorder, encoded here in a slow dynamics of the
coupling constants. The frequency-dependent third-order response of the model
qualitatively reproduces the typical humped shape reported in experiments. The
temperature dependence of the maximum value is also qualitatively reproduced.
In contrast, the humped shape of the third-order response is not reproduced by
a simple kinetically constrained spin model with non-interacting spins. To
rationalize these results, we propose a two-length-scale scenario by
distinguishing between the characteristic length of dynamical heterogeneities
and a coherence length that monitors the effect of interactions. We show that
both length scales are identical in the kinetically constrained spin model,
while they have significantly different dynamics in the model of interacting
spins.

<p>The application of a gate voltage to control the superconducting current
flowing through a nanoscale superconducting constriction, named as
gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS), has raised great interest for fundamental
and technological reasons. To gain a deeper understanding of this effect and
develop superconducting technologies based on it, the material and physical
parameters crucial for GCS must be identified. Top-down fabrication protocols
should be also optimized to increase device scalability, although studies
suggest that top-down fabricated devices are more resilient to show GCS. Here,
we investigate gated superconducting nanobridges made with a top-down
fabrication process from thin films of the non-centrosymmetric superconductor
NbRe. Unlike other devices previously reported, our NbRe devices systematically
exhibit GCS, when made in specific conditions, which paves the way for higher
device scalability. Our results also suggest that surface properties of NbRe
nanobridges and their modification during fabrication are key for GCS.

<p>We investigate thermomagnetic transport in an ultracold atomic system with
two ferromagnets linked via a magnetic quantum point contact. Using
nonequilibrium Green's function approach, we show a divergence in spin
conductance and a slowing down of spin relaxation that manifest in the weak

superstatistical theory, recent works have shown some necessary conditions for
a superstatistical description of a given steady state, in terms of the
fundamental and microcanonical inverse temperature. In this work, a new theorem
that establishes a sufficient condition for the existence of a superstatistical
description of a particular steady state is presented, using the language of
moment-generating functions and connecting them with properties of the

<p>Identifying a nanostructure suitable for hydrogen storage presents a
promising avenue for the secure and cost-effective utilization of hydrogen as a
green energy source. This study introduces a systematic approach for selecting
optimal doping on porous materials, emphasizing the intricate interplay between
doping with the material's structure and the interaction between doping and
hydrogen. Our proposed approach serves as a framework for evaluating and
predicting the performance of doped materials. To validate the efficacy of our
strategy, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
Applying our criteria, we systematically screen several dopants in CNTs. The
results highlight Cu-doped CNTs as promising candidates for hydrogen storage
applications. Focusing on Cu-doped CNTs, we analyze binding energy, charge
transfer, partial density of states (PDOS), and desorption temperature to
assess the performance of modified CNTs. Additionally, we explore the
feasibility of doped CNTs featuring various sizes of copper clusters and the
effect on the release temperature, i.e., complete regeneration. The findings
indicate that incorporating 5 to 6% copper impurity onto CNT surfaces renders
these nanostructures highly applicable for reversible hydrogen storage near
ambient conditions.

<p>The buckling instability of micro- and nanopillars can be an issue when
designing intelligent miniaturized devices and characterizing composite
materials reinforced with beam-like particles on the small-scale. Analytical
modeling of the buckling of miniaturized pillars is especially important due to
the difficulties in conducting experiments. Here, a well-posed stress-driven
nonlocal model is developed, which allows the calculation of the critical loads
and buckling configurations of the miniaturized pillars on an elastic
foundation and with arbitrary numbers of edge cracks. The discontinuities in
bending slopes and deflection at the damaged cross-sections due to the edge
cracks are captured through the incorporation of both rotational and
translational springs. A comprehensive analysis is conducted to investigate the
instability of pillars containing a range of one to four cracks. This analysis
reveals interesting effects regarding the influence of crack location,
nonlocality, and elastic foundation on the initial and subsequent critical
loads and associated buckling configurations. The main findings are: (i) the
shielding and amplification effects related to a system of cracks become more
significant as the dimensions of pillars reduce, (ii) the influence of the
shear force at the damaged cross-section related to the translational spring
must not be neglected when dealing with higher modes of buckling and long
cracks, (iii) an elastic foundation decreases the effects of the cracks and
size dependency on the buckling loads, and (iv) the effects of the edge cracks
on the critical loads and buckling configurations of the miniaturized pillars
are highly dependent on the boundary conditions.

<h3>Pair correlations of the hybridized orbitals in a ladder model for the  bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

<i>Masataka Kakoi, Tatsuya Kaneko, Hirofumi Sakakibara, Masayuki Ochi, Kazuhiko Kuroki</i>
<p>To clarify the nature of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer
nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate, using the
density-matrix renormalization group method, the pair correlations in the
two-orbital $t$-$J$ ladder model. While the interchain-intraorbital pair
correlations exhibit a slow power-law decay in both orbitals, the interorbital
pair correlation also develops due to the hybridization via interorbital
hopping. These intra and interorbital pair correlations are enhanced by Hund's
coupling, but more importantly, the interorbital pairing correlation develops
even without Hund's coupling, where apparent interorbital pairing glue is
absent. Our finding suggests that the hybridized two-orbital picture precisely
describes superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate.

<h3>Elasticity tunes mechanical stress localization around active  topological defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04309" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04309</a>
<br>
<i>Lasse Bonn, Aleksandra Ardaševa, Amin Doostmohammadi</i>
<p>Mechanical stresses are increasingly found to be associated with various
biological functionalities. At the same time, topological defects are being
identified across a diverse range of biological systems and are points of
localized mechanical stress. It is therefore important to ask how mechanical
stress localization around topological defects is controlled. Here, we use
continuum simulations of nonequilibrium, fluctuating and active nematics to
explore the patterns of stress localization, as well as their extent and
intensity around topological defects. We find that by increasing the
orientational elasticity of the material, the isotropic stress pattern around
topological defects is changed substantially from a stress dipole characterized
by symmetric compression-tension regions around the core of the defect to a
localized stress monopole at the defect position. Moreover, we show that
elastic anisotropy alters the extent and intensity of the stresses, and can
result in the dominance of tension or compression around defects. Finally,
including both nonequilibrium fluctuations and active stress generation, we
find that the elastic constant tunes the relative effect of each, leading to
the flipping of tension and compression regions around topological defects.
This flipping of the tension-compression regions only by changing the elastic
constant presents an interesting, simple, way of switching the dynamic behavior
in active matter by changing a passive material property. We expect these
findings to motivate further exploration tuning stresses in active biological
materials by varying material properties of the constituent units.

<h3>Freezing-induced topological transition of double-emulsion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04317</a>
<br>
<i>Jochem G. Meijer, Pallav Kant, Detlef Lohse</i>
<p>Solidification of complex liquids is pertinent to numerous natural and
industrial processes. Here, we examine the freezing of a W/O/W double-emulsion,
i.e., water-in-oil compound droplets dispersed in water. We show that the
solidification of such hierarchical emulsions can trigger a topological
transition; for example, in our case, we observe the transition from the stable
W/O/W state to a (frozen) O/W single-emulsion configuration. Strikingly, this
transition is characterised by sudden expulsion of the inner water drop from
the encapsulating oil droplet. We propose that this topological transition is
triggered by the freezing of the encapsulating oil droplet from the outside in,
putting tension on the inner water drop thus, destabilizing the W/O/W
configuration. Using high-speed imaging we characterize the destabilization
process. Interestingly, we find that below a critical size of the inner drop,
$R_{\mathrm{in,crit}} \approx 19 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$, the topological transition
does not occur any more and the double-emulsion remains stable, in line with
our interpretation.

<p>Here we demonstrate nano-sized superconducting Dayem-bridge weak-links made
of different stoichiometric compositions of NbRe. Our devices possess a
relatively high critical temperature, normal-state resistance, and kinetic
inductance. In particular, the high kinetic inductance makes this material a
good alternative to more conventional niobium-based superconductors (e.g., NbN
or NbTiN) for the realization of superinductors and high-quality factor
resonators, whereas the high normal-state resistance yields a large output
voltage in superconducting switches and logic elements realized upon this
compound. Moreover, out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exceeding 2 T ensure
that possible applications requiring high magnetic fields can also be
envisaged. Altogether, these features make this material appealing for a number
of applications in the framework of quantum technologies.

<i>Ting-Fung Jeffrey Poon, Yuhao Wan, Yucheng Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu</i>
<p>Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of Anderson transition to the
quasi-random and low-dimensional realm, exhibiting intricate behaviors even in
the one-dimension, while their investigation in higher dimensions remains less
explored. Here, we delve into a series of two-dimensional lattice models of
Hall systems with asymptotically incommensurate flux, and reveal the impact of
asymptotic incommensurability on transport phenomena. Specifically, we
demonstrate anomalous bulk transport with universal scaling characteristics in
the wave-packet dynamics and conductivity, and predict novel interplay effects
involving asymptotic incommensurability, temperature, and relaxation, leading
to unprecedented multiple anisotropic metal-insulator transitions. Furthermore,
the quasiperiodicity also induces nontrivial anisotropy in edge transport when
the system is fully insulating in one direction. Our work enriches the
fundamental mechanisms underlying the metal-insulator transitions with
anomalous bulk and edge transport driven by incommensurability in higher
dimension, potentially opening an intriguing avenue for exploring novel
transport phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.

<p>When two different electronic materials are brought together, the resultant
interface often shows unexpected quantum phenomena, including interfacial
superconductivity and Fu-Kane topological superconductivity (TSC). Here, we use
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to synthesize heterostructures formed by stacking
together two magnetic materials, a ferromagnetic topological insulator (TI) and
an antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide (FeTe). We discover emergent
interface-induced superconductivity in these heterostructures and demonstrate
the trifecta occurrence of superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and topological
band structure in the magnetic TI layer, the three essential ingredients of
chiral TSC. The unusual coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity can
be attributed to the high upper critical magnetic field that exceeds the Pauli
paramagnetic limit for conventional superconductors at low temperatures. The
magnetic TI/FeTe heterostructures with robust superconductivity and atomically
sharp interfaces provide an ideal wafer-scale platform for the exploration of
chiral TSC and Majorana physics, constituting an important step toward scalable
topological quantum computation.

<h3>Chirality induced spin selectivity in chiral crystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Qun Yang, Yongkang Li, Claudia Felser, Binghai Yan</i>
<p>Chirality is a fundamental property of great importance in physics,
chemistry, and biology. Recently, an exotic phenomenon known as
chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), in which electrons with a particular
spin can pass through chiral molecules, has shown promising application
potential in spintronic devices, spin control chemistry, and enantiomer
separation, among others. However, current CISS studies focus mainly on chiral
organic molecules with poor electronic conductivity and inherent complexities,
such as the controversial role of SOC at the molecule-metal interface. In
contrast, chiral inorganic materials with excellent electrical conductivity,
intrinsic SOC, homochiral crystal structure, and rich electronic properties
open up new possibilities for advancing CISS studies. In this work, we
demonstrate that electrons exhibit both spin and orbital polarization as they
pass through chiral crystals. Both polarizations increase with material
thickness until approach bulk properties. The spin polarization correlates with
the SOC strength, while the orbital polarization is SOC insensitive.
Furthermore, our results reveal a substantial spin polarization ratio in Te and
significant electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy in RhSi. Though the latter is
usually employed to probe the former, the results show a clear difference
between these two quantities. Our work reveals the interplay of chirality,
electron spin, and orbital in chiral crystals, paving the way for the
development of chiral inorganic materials for CISS applications.

<p>Structural modelling of $operando$ pair distribution function (PDF) data of

operando PDF data, we here demonstrate a toolbox for PDF analysis. The tools
include the structureMining, similarityMapping, nmfMapping apps available
through the online service 'PDF in the cloud' (PDFitc, www.pdfitc.org), as well

<h3>Features of magnetization and spin reorientation in weak ferrimagnets of  the YFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ type</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander Moskvin, Evgenii Vasinovich</i>
<p>A brief critical review is given of the 50-year history of experimental and
theoretical studies of the magnetic properties of a new promising class of weak
ferrimagnets such as RFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ with a non-magnetic R-ion (R = La ,
Y, Lu), i.e. systems with competing signs of the Dzyaloshinsky vectors Fe-Fe,
Cr-Cr and Fe-Cr. The spin Hamiltonian of the system is considered taking into
account isotropic exchange, antisymmetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya exchange, and
second- and fourth-order single-ion anisotropy. Within the framework of the
molecular field approximation, calculations were made of the Neel temperatures,
the average magnetic moments of $3d$ ions, total and partial magnetizations,
and effective anisotropy constants. The existence in the model system
YFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ of two regions of negative magnetization $0.25 \leq
x\leq 0.5$ and $x\approx 0.8$ with the corresponding magnetization reversal
points reaching room temperature at $x\approx 0.45$. The phenomenon of spin
reorientation observed for single-crystal samples in a wide range of
concentrations is explained by a sharp decrease in the contribution of
antisymmetric exchange to magnetic anisotropy with increasing deviation from
the parent compositions and competition between the contributions of single-ion
anisotropy of Fe and Cr ions. It has been suggested that the spatial
orientation of the Neel ${\bf G}$ vector and the $G_{xyz}$ configuration are
the reason for the small value of saturation magnetization observed
experimentally for compositions inside or near the region of negative
magnetization.

<h3>Canonical scattering problem in topological metamaterials: Valley-Hall  modes through a bend</h3>

<br>
<i>Theo Torres, Cédric Bellis, Régis Cottereau, Antonin Coutant</i>
<p>We study the amount of backscattering of Valley Hall modes in a classical
topological insulator. In reciprocal systems, the conservation of the valley
index has been argued to be at the root of the high-transmission of Valley Hall
modes, observed in many experimental realisations. Here, we reconsider this
hypothesis by quantitatively analysing the canonical scattering problem of
interface Valley Hall modes impinging on sharp bends which may or may not
conserve the valley index. We consider a tight binding model of graphene
ribbons with an interface and compute the reflection and transmission
coefficients using a transfer matrix formalism. We find that, in all
configurations, the transmission of Valley Hall modes is close to being
maximal, even in cases where the valley index is not conserved. Our results
reinforce the alternative interpretation of the high-transmission of Valley
Hall modes in reciprocal metamaterials as a consequence of a favorable mode
matching on each side of the defect and serve as a reference case for the
design of Valley Hall type metamaterial.

<h3>Competing d$_{xy}$ and s$_{\pm }$ Pairing Symmetries in Superconducting  La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ emerge from LDA+FLEX Calculations</h3>

<br>
<i>Griffin Heier, Kyungwha Park, Sergey Y. Savrasov</i>
<p>With recent discoveries of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates,
and in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, new opportunities appeared
that yet another family of high-temperature superconductors based on Ni element
may exist in Nature as was previously the case of cuprates and iron based
materials. With their famous strong Coulomb correlations among 3d electrons and
the proximity to antiferromagnetic instability these systems represent a
challenge for their theoretical description, and most previous studies of
superconductivity relied on the solutions of simplified few--orbital model
Hamiltonians. Here, on the other hand, we use a recently developed combination
of density functional theory with momentum and frequency resolved
self--energies deduced from the so--called Fluctuational-Exchange (FLEX)-type
Random Phase Approximation (RPA) to study spin fluctuation mediated pairing
tendencies in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure. This methodology uses
first--principle electronic structures of an actual material and is free of
tight-binding parametrizations employed in model Hamiltonian approach. Based on
our numerical diagonalization of the BCS Gap equation we show that competing
d$_{xy}$ and s$_{\pm }$ pairing symmetries emerge in superconducting
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ with the corresponding coupling constants becoming very
large in the proximity of spin density wave instability. The results presented
here are discussed in light of numerous other calculations and provide
on--going experimental efforts with predictions that will allow further tests
of our understanding of unconventional superconductors.

<p>Multi-band Mott insulators with moderate spin-orbit and Hund's coupling are
key reference points for theoretical concept developments of correlated

been intensively studied by spectroscopic probes. However, it has been
challenging to resolve the fundamental excitations emerging from the hierarchy
of electronic energy scales. Here we apply state-of-the-art resonant inelastic
x-ray scattering to probe deeper into the electronic excitations found in
Ca$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$. In this fashion, we probe a series of spin-orbital
excitations at low energies and resolve the level splitting of the
intra-$t_{2g}$ structure due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal field
splitting. Most importantly, the low-energy excitations exhibit strong orbital
character. Such direct determination of relevant electronic energy scales is
important, as it sharpens the target for theory developments of Mott
insulators' orbital degree of freedom.

<h3>Tuning magnetic interactions of Co and 4$d$ transition-metal atomic  bilayers on Re(0001) via interface engineering</h3>

<br>
<i>Souvik Paul, Stefan Heinze</i>
<p>Employing $\textit{ab-initio}$ density functional theory (DFT), we performed
a systematic investigation of the electronic structures and the magnetic
properties of atomic bilayers composed of a 4$d$ transition-metal layer (Rh, Pd
and Ru) and a Co layer on the Re(0001) surface. Our DFT calculations reveal the
influence of the bilayer composition and their stacking sequence on the
magnetic ground state and magnetic interactions. We obtain the magnetic
interactions by mapping the total energies onto an effective spin Hamiltonian
which contains the exchange interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) as well as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). We
observe noticeable changes in bilayer hybridization due to variation in bilayer
composition and overlayer symmetry, leading to significant variation in
magnetic interactions. In all considered systems, the nearest-neighbor exchange
interaction is ferromagnetic, however, the value varies by up to a factor of 5.
The effective, nearest-neighbor DMI constant exhibits variation in sign over
the films considered, favoring either right- (clockwise) or left-handed
(anticlockwise) cycloidal spin spirals. The value of the DMI changes by up to a
factor of 27 among the films. For most of the systems, the MAE favors an
out-of-plane easy magnetization axis, however, for hcp-Co/Rh and hcp-Co/Ru
bilayers on Re(0001), it prefers an in-plane magnetization axis. The magnitude
of the MAE varies from a small value of about 0.1 meV/Co atom up to about 2
meV/Co atom for Co/Pd bilayers. The spin spiral energy dispersion curve rises
quite quickly close to the ferromagnetic state for films in which the Co layer
is adjacent to the vacuum indicating a large effective exchange constant which
stabilizes a ferromagnetic ground state in Co/$4d$ bilayers on Re(0001).

<p>We investigate the direction-dependent switching current in a flux-tunable
four-terminal Josephson junction defined in an InAs/Al two-dimensional
heterostructure. The device exhibits the Josephson diode effect, with switching
currents that depend on the sign of the bias current. The superconducting diode
efficiency, reaching a maximum of $|\eta|\approx34\%$, is widely tunable - both
in amplitude and sign - as a function of magnetic fluxes and gate voltages. Our
observations are supported by a circuit model of three parallel Josephson
junctions with non-sinusoidal current-phase relation. With respect to
conventional Josephson interferometers, phase-tunable multiterminal Josephson
junctions enable large diode efficiencies in structurally symmetric devices,
where local magnetic fluxes break both time-reversal and spatial-inversion
symmetries. Our work establishes a pathway to develop Josephson diodes with
wide-range tunability and that do not rely on exotic materials or externally
applied magnetic fields.

<p>In this work, we develop a stochastic matrix product state (stoMPS) approach
that combines the MPS technique and Monte Carlo samplings and can be applied to
simulate quantum lattice models down to low temperature. In particular, we
exploit a procedure to unbiasedly sample the local tensors in the matrix
product states, which has one physical index of dimension $d$ and two geometric
indices of dimension $D$, and find the results can be continuously improved by
enlarging $D$. We benchmark the methods on small system sizes and then compare
the results to those obtained with minimally entangled typical thermal states,
finding that stoMPS has overall better performance with finite $D$. We further
exploit the MPS sampling to simulate long spin chains, as well as the
triangular and square lattices with cylinder circumference $W$ up to 4. Our
results showcase the accuracy and effectiveness of stochastic tensor networks
in finite-temperature simulations.

<br>
<i>Ricardo Y. Díaz-Bonifaz, Carlos Ramírez</i>
<p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states with normalizable
wave functions and energies that lie within the continuous spectrum for which
extended or dispersive states are also available. These special states, which
have shown great applicability in photonic systems for devices such as lasers
and sensors, are also predicted to exist in electronic low-dimensional
solid-state systems. The non-trivial topology of materials is within the known
mechanisms that prevent the bound states to couple with the extended states. In
this work we search for topologically protected BICs in a quantum Hall bar with
an anti-dot formed by a pore far from the borders of the bar. The bound state
energies and wavefunctions are calculated by means of the Recursive S-Matrix
method. The resulting bound state energies coexist with extended states and
exhibit a pattern complimentary to the Hofstadter butterfly. A
symmetry-breaking diagonal disorder was introduced, showing that the BICs with
energies far from the Landau levels remain robust. Moreover, the energy
difference between consecutive BICs multiplied by the anti-dot perimeter
follows the same curve despite disorder. Finally, a BIC-mediated current
switching effect was found in a multi-terminal setup, which might permit their
experimental detection.

<p>Dimensional confinement has shown to be an effective strategy to tune
competing degrees of freedom in complex oxides. Here, we achieved atomic
layered growth of trigonal vanadium sesquioxide (V2O3) by means of
oxygen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. This led to a series of high-quality
epitaxial ultrathin V2O3 films down to unit cell thickness, enabling the study
of the intrinsic electron correlations upon confinement. By electrical and
optical measurements, we demonstrate a dimensional confinement-induced
metal-insulator transition in these ultrathin films. We shed light on the
Mott-Hubbard nature of this transition, revealing an abrupt vanishing of the
quasiparticle weight as demonstrated by photoemission spectroscopy.
Furthermore, we prove that dimensional confinement acts as an effective
out-of-plane stress. This highlights the structural component of correlated
oxides in a confined architecture, while opening an avenue to control both
in-plane and out-of-plane lattice components by epitaxial strain and
confinement, respectively.

<p>Fluids made of two-dimensional hard particles with polygonal shapes may
stabilize symmetries which do not result directly from the particle shape. This
is due to the formation of clusters in the fluid. Entropy alone can drive these
effects, which represent a challenge for standard theories. In this article we
present a general density-functional theory for clustering effects in fluids of
hard particles in two dimensions. The theory combines a free-energy functional
of the angular distribution function with an association energy term which
qualitatively reproduces the clustering tendencies of the particles found in
Monte Carlo simulations. Application is made to a fluid of hard right-angled
triangles.

<i>Hong Li, Siyu Cheng, Ganesh Pokharel, Philipp Eck, Chiara Bigi, Federico Mazzola, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Stephen D. Wilson, Domenico Di Sante, Ziqiang Wang, Ilija Zeljkovic</i>
<p>Berry phase and the related concept of Berry curvature can give rise to many
unconventional phenomena in solids. In this work, we discover colossal orbital
Zeeman effect of topological origin in a newly synthesized bilayer kagome metal
TbV6Sn6. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study
the magnetic field induced renormalization of the electronic band structure.
The nonmagnetic vanadium d-orbitals form Dirac crossings at the K point with a
small mass gap and strong Berry curvature induced by the spin-orbit coupling.
We reveal that the magnetic field leads to the splitting of gapped Dirac
dispersion into two branches with giant momentum-dependent g factors, resulting
in the substantial renormalization of the Dirac band. These measurements
provide a direct observation of the magnetic field controlled orbital Zeeman
coupling to the enormous orbital magnetic moments of up to 200 Bohr magnetons
near the gapped Dirac points. Interestingly, the effect is increasingly
non-linear, and becomes gradually suppressed at higher magnetic fields.
Theoretical modeling further confirms the existence of orbital magnetic moments
in TbV6Sn6 produced by the non-trivial spin-Berry curvature of the Bloch wave
functions. Our work provides the first direct insight into the
momentum-dependent nature of topological orbital moments and their tunability
by magnetic field concomitant with the evolution of the spin-Berry curvature.
Significantly large orbital magnetic moments driven by the Berry curvature can
also be generated by other quantum numbers beyond spin, such as the valley in
certain graphene-based structures, which may be unveiled using the same tools

<h3>Relativistic materials from an alternative viewpoint</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04448</a>

<i>Ann E. Mattsson, Daniel A. Rehn</i>
<p>Electrons in materials containing heavy elements are fundamentally
relativistic and should in principle be described using the Dirac equation.
However, the current standard for treatment of electrons in such materials
involves density functional theory methods originally formulated from the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. While some extensions of the Schr\"{o}dinger-based
formulation have been explored, such as the scalar relativistic approximation
with or without spin-orbit coupling, these solutions do not provide a way to
fully account for all relativistic effects of electrons, and the language used
to describe such solutions are still based in the language of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In this article, we provide a different method for
translating between the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger viewpoints in the context of
a Coulomb potential. By retaining the Dirac four-vector notation and
terminology in taking the non-relativistic limit, we see a much deeper
connection between the Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger equation solutions that allow
us to more directly compare the effects of relativity in the angular and radial
functions. Through this viewpoint, we introduce the concepts of densitals and
Dirac spherical harmonics that allow us to translate more easily between the
Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger solutions. These concepts allow us to establish a
useful language for discussing relativistic effects in materials containing
elements throughout the full periodic table and thereby enable a more
fundamental understanding of the effects of relativity on electronic structure.

<h3>On the Role of Charge Transfer Excitations in Non-Fullerene Acceptors  for Organic Photovoltaics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04459</a>

<i>Samuele Giannini, Daniel J. C. Sowood, Jesus Cerda, Siebe Frederix, Jeannine Grune, Giacomo Londi, Thomas Marsh, Pratyush Ghosh, Ivan Duchemin, Neil C. Greenham, Koen Vandewal, Gabriele D'Avino, Alexander J. Gillett, David Beljonne</i>
<p>Through the development of new non-fullerene electron acceptor (NFA)
materials, such as Y6 and its molecular derivatives, the power conversion
efficiencies of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have now exceeded 19%. However,
despite this rapid progress, our fundamental understanding of the unique
optical and electronic properties of these Y-series NFAs is lacking, and this
currently limits progress in material design. In this work, we provide a
detailed computational-experimental characterisation of the archetypal NFA, Y6.
To explain the significant broadening and red shift of the absorption spectrum
observed when moving from the solution phase to the solid state, we first rule
out more typical causes, such as J-aggregation. Instead, by considering the
role of charge transfer (CT) excitations and their mixing with Frenkel exciton
(FE) states, we can computationally reproduce the experimental absorption
spectra of Y6 with excellent accuracy. Using transient absorption spectroscopy,
we provide evidence for this dense manifold of FE-CT hybrid electronic
excitations in Y6 through the prominent sub-picosecond relaxation events
following supra band gap excitation. Furthermore, through sub band gap
excitation, we also find states with polaronic character in Y6 that are in a
dynamic equilibrium with the FE-CT hybrid states. Magnetic resonance
spectroscopies reveal that these polaronic states are polaron pairs, most
likely located on neighbouring Y6 molecules, not free charge carriers, as has
been previously suggested. Thus, this new understanding of how the solid-state
packing motif directly controls the optical and electronic properties of
Y-series NFAs opens the door to intelligently design NFA materials to further
increase OPV performance.

<h3>Composite subsystem symmetries and decoration of sub-dimensional  excitations</h3>

<br>
<i>Avi Vadali, Zongyuan Wang, Arpit Dua, Wilbur Shirley, Xie Chen</i>
<p>Flux binding is a mechanism that is well-understood for global symmetries.
Given two systems, each with a global symmetry, gauging the composite symmetry
instead of individual symmetries corresponds to the condensation of the
composite of gauge charges belonging to individually gauged theories and the
binding of the gauge fluxes. The condensed composite charge is created by a
``short" string given by the new minimal coupling corresponding to the
composite symmetry. This paper studies what happens when combined subsystem
symmetries are gauged, especially when the component charges and fluxes have
different sub-dimensional mobilities. We investigate $3+1$D systems with planar
symmetries where, for example, the planar symmetry of a planon charge is
combined with one of the planar symmetries of a fracton charge. We propose the
principle of \textit{Remote Detectability} to determine how the fluxes bind and
potentially change their mobility. This understanding can then be used to
design fracton models with sub-dimensional excitations that are decorated with
excitations having nontrivial statistics or non-abelian fusion rules.

<h3>Can helicity modulus be defined for boundary conditions with finite  twist?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04468" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04468</a>
<br>
<i>Gaurav Khairnar, Thomas Vojta</i>
<p>We study the response of a two-dimensional classical XY model to a finite
(non-infinitesimal) twist of the boundary conditions. We use Monte Carlo
simulations to evaluate the free energy difference between periodic and
twisted-periodic boundary conditions and find deviations from the expected
quadratic dependence on the twist angle. Consequently, the helicity modulus
(spin-stiffness) shows a non-trivial dependence on the twist angle. We show
that the deviation from the expected behavior arises because of a degeneracy
due to the chirality of the spin-waves which leads to an additional entropy
contribution in the quasi-long-range ordered phase. We give an improved
prescription for the numerical evaluation of the helicity modulus and resolve
some open questions related to anti-periodic boundary conditions. We also
discuss applications to discrete spin systems and some experimental scenarios
where boundary conditions with finite twist are necessary.

<h3>Finite Soliton Width Matters: Investigating Non-equilibrium Exchange  Phases of Anyons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04475</a>
<br>
<i>Matthias Thamm, Bernd Rosenow</i>
<p>Unlike bosons and fermions, quasi-particles in two-dimensional quantum
systems, known as anyons, exhibit statistical exchange phases that range
between $0$ and $\pi$. In fractional quantum Hall states, these anyons,
possessing a fraction of the electron charge, traverse along chiral edge
channels. This movement facilitates the creation of anyon colliders, where
coupling different edge channels through a quantum point contact enables the
observation of two-particle interference effects. Such configurations are
instrumental in deducing the anyonic exchange phase via current
cross-correlations. Prior theoretical models represented dilute anyon beams as
discrete steps in the boson fields. However, our study reveals that
incorporating the finite width of the soliton shape is crucial for accurately
interpreting recent experiments, especially for collider experiments involving
anyons with exchange phases $\theta>\pi/2$, where prior theories fall short.

<h3>Electromagnetic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven spintronic THz  emitters: A time-dependent density functional theory plus Jefimenko equations  approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04476" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04476</a>
<br>
<i>Ali Kefayati, Branislav K. Nikolic</i>
<p>Microscopic origins of charge currents and electromagnetic (EM) radiation
generated by them in spintronic THz emitters -- such as, femtosecond laser
pulse-driven single magnetic layer or its heterostructures with a nonmagnetic
layer hosting strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) -- remain poorly understood
despite nearly three decades since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization.
We introduce a first-principles method to compute these quantities, where the
dynamics of charge and current densities is obtained from real-time
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), which are then fed into the
Jefimenko equations for properly retarded electric and magnetic field solutions
of the Maxwell equations. By Fourier transforming different time-dependent
terms in the Jefimenko equations, we unravel that in 0.1--30 THz range the
electric field of far-field EM radiation by Ni layer, chosen as an example, is
dominated by charge current pumped by demagnetization, while often invoked
magnetic dipole radiation from time-dependent magnetization of a single
magnetic layer is a negligible effect. Such overlooked case of charge current
pumping by time-dependent quantum system, whose magnetization is shrinking
while its vector does not rotate, does not require any spin-to-charge
conversion via SOC effects. In Ni/Pt bilayer, EM radiation remains dominated by
charge current within Ni layer, whose magnitude is larger than in the case of
single Ni layer due to faster demagnetization, while often invoked
spin-to-charge conversion within Pt layer provides additional but smaller
contribution. By using Poynting vector and its flux, we also quantify
efficiency of conversion of light into emitted EM radiation, as well as the
angular dependence of the latter.

<i>R. Taranko, K. Wrześniewski, I. Weymann, T. Domański</i>
<p>We investigate gradual development of the quasiparticle states in two quantum
dots attached to opposite sides of the topological superconducting nanowire,
hosting the boundary modes. Specifically, we explore the non-equilibrium
cross-correlations transmitted between these quantum dots via the zero-energy
Majorana modes. From the analytical and numerical results we reveal nonlocal
features in the transient behavior of electron pairing, which subsequently
cease while the hybrid structure evolves towards its asymptotic steady limit
configuration. We estimate duration of these temporary nonlocal phenomena and
inspect their possible manifestation in the quench-driven processes. Such
dynamical effects might play an important role in braiding protocols of the
topological and/or conventional superconducting quantum bits using nanoscopic
hybrid structures.

<h3>Assembling PNIPAM-Capped Gold Nanoparticles in Aqueous Solutions</h3>

<i>Binay P. Nayak, Hyeong Jin Kim, Srikanth Nayak, Wenjie Wang, Wei Bu, Surya K. Mallapragada, David Vaknin</i>
<p>Employing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we explore the conditions
under which the assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) grafted with the
thermo-sensitive polymer Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) emerges. We find
that short-range order assembly emerges by combining the addition of
electrolytes or poly-electrolytes with raising the temperature of the
suspensions above the lower-critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM. Our
results show that the longer the PNIPAM chain is, the better organization in
the assembled clusters. Interestingly, without added electrolytes, there is no
evidence of AuNP assembly as a function of temperature, although untethered
PNIPAM is known to undergo a coil-to-globule transition above its LCST. This
study demonstrates another approach to assembling potential thermo-sensitive
nanostructures for devices by leveraging the unique properties of PNIPAM.

<h3>Is $MgB_2$ a superconductor?</h3>

<i>E.F. Talantsev, V.S. Minkov, V. Ksenofontov, S.L. Bud'ko, M.I. Eremets</i>
<p>Hirsch and Marsiglio, in their recent publication (J. Supercond. Nov. Mag.
35, 3141-3145 (2022)), assert that experimental data on the trapping of
magnetic flux by hydrogen-rich compounds clearly demonstrate the absence of
superconductivity in hydrides at high pressures. We argue that this assertion
is incorrect, as it relies on the wrong model coupled with selective
manipulations (hide/delete) of calculated datasets and ignores the reference
measurements after the release of pressure. A critical examination of the
authors' claim of having performed fitting of experimental data to the model
reveals that, in fact, the authors conducted simulations where all free
parameters were fixed. Importantly, an application of the Hirsch-Marsiglio
model to $MgB_2$ leads to the conclusion that it is not a superconductor.

<p>Transport properties of Weyl semimetals are intimately connected to the
underlying band structure. The signature of Weyl semimetals are linear
dispersing bands that touch, forming Weyl points that result in high charge
carrier mobilities. The layered transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe2,
undergoes a temperature dependent phase transition that directly converts the
trivial 1Tprime phase to the nontrivial Td phase, providing an opportunity to
understand how the formation of a Weyl point manifests in the ultrafast carrier
dynamics. In this study, we use resonant X-ray photoemission to monitor the
element specific evolution of excited carriers 1Tprime-MoTe2 and in the
vicinity of the Weyl point in Td-MoTe2. We find that the delocalization time of
1Tprime-MoTe2 is a factor 1.5 times faster than in Td-MoTe2. We argue that this
is a result of the change in the density of states and screening length, to a
higher carrier scattering rate in Td-MoTe2. Our study tracks the fate of
carriers in MoTe2 on sub-fs time-scales and with atomic site specificity.

<h3>Automatic Calculation of the Transition Temperatures for two-dimensional  Heisenberg type Magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Haichang Lu, Tai Yang, Zhimei Sun, John Robertson, Weisheng Zhao</i>
<p>Theoretical prediction of the 2nd-order magnetic transition temperature (TM)
used to be arduous. Here, we develop a first principle-based, fully automatic
structure-to-TM method for two-dimensional (2D) magnets whose effective
Hamiltonians follow the Heisenberg model. The Heisenberg exchanges, which can
be calculated to an arbitrary shell, are transferred into the Monte Carlo
calculation. Using Cr-based magnets as the showcases, we show that our method
is a powerful tool to study the 2D magnets in two aspects. First, considering
long-range exchanges enables us to identify the spin frustration in the
suspended CrTe2 monolayer, whereas the heterostructure calculations reveal that
the ferromagnetism can be recovered if the monolayer CrTe2 is grown onto
various 2D substrates. Second, we realize a high-throughput screening of novel
magnets discovered by random structure searches. Six 2D Cr chalcogenides are
selected to have high TM. Our work provides a new insight for the study of 2D
magnets and helps accelerate the pace of magnetic materials data-mining.

<p>In this investigation, we explore the thermal effects on a suspension
containing isotropic scattering phototactic microorganisms. The setup involves
illuminating the suspension with collimated irradiation from the top, coupled
with heating or cooling applied from the bottom. The governing equations
encompass the Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation, the
diffusion equation for motile microorganisms, and the energy equation for
temperature. Using linear perturbation theory, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of the suspension's linear stability. The findings of this
investigation reveal that the suspension experiences increased stability as a
consequence of scattering.

<i>Anushna Bhattacharya, Vikas Tiwari, Tarak Karmakar</i>
<p>The generation of controlled microstructures of functionalized nanoparticles
has been one of the crucial challenges in nanoscience and nanotechnology.
Efforts have been made to tune ligand charge states that can affect the
aggregation propensity and modulate the self-assembled structures. In this
work, we modelled zwitterionic Janus-like monolayer ligand-protected metal
nanoclusters (J-MPCs) and studied their self-assembly using atomistic molecular
dynamics and advanced enhanced sampling simulations. The oppositely-charged
ligands functionalization on two hemispheres of a J-MPC elicits asymmetric
solvation, primarily driven by distinctive hydrogen bonding patterns in the
ligand-solvent interactions. Electrostatic interactions between the oppositely
charged residues in J-MPCs guide the formation of one-dimensional and ring-like
self-assembled superstructures with molecular dipoles oriented in specific
patterns. The pertinent atomistic insights into the intermolecular interactions
governing the self-assembled structures of zwitterionic J-MPCs obtained from
this work can be used to design a general strategy to create tunable
microstructures of charged MPCs.

<h3>Direct and indirect spin current generation and spin-orbit torques in  ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04538</a>
<br>
<i>V. P. Amin, G. G. Baez Flores, A. A. Kovalev, K. D. Belashchenko</i>
<p>Spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers are studied
using a combination of symmetry analysis, circuit theory, semiclassical
simulations, and first-principles calculations using the non-equilibrium
Green's function method with supercell disorder averaging. We focus on
unconventional processes involving the interplay between the two ferromagnetic
layers, which are classified into direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct
mechanism involves spin current generation by one ferromagnetic layer and its
subsequent absorption by the other. In the indirect mechanism, the in-plane
spin-polarized current from one ferromagnetic layer ``leaks'' into the other
layer, where it is converted into an out-of-plane spin current and reabsorbed
by the original layer. The direct mechanism results in a predominantly
dampinglike torque, which damps the magnetization towards a certain direction
$\mathbf{s}_d$. The indirect mechanism results in a predominantly fieldlike
torque with respect to a generally different direction $\mathbf{s}_f$. Similar
to the current-in-plane giant magnetoresistance, the indirect mechanism is only
active if the thickness of the nonmagnetic spacer is smaller than or comparable
to the mean-free path. Numerical calculations for a semiclassical model based
on the Boltzmann equation confirm the presence of both direct and indirect
mechanisms of spin current generation. First-principles calculations reveal
sizeable unconventional spin-orbit torques in Co/Cu/Co, Py/Cu/Py, and Co/Pt/Co
trilayers and provide strong evidence of indirect spin current generation.

<h3>Electron phonon coupling in ultrathin Pb films on Si(111): Where the  heck is the energy?</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Tajik, T. Witte, Ch. Brand, L. Rettig, B. Sothmann, U. Bovensiepen, M. Horn von Hoegen</i>
<p>In this work, we study the heat transfer from electron to phonon system
within a five monolayer thin epitaxial Pb film on Si(111) upon fs-laser
excitation. The response of the electron system is determined using
time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy while the lattice excitation is
measured by means of the Debye-Waller effect in time-resolved reflection
high-energy electron diffraction. The electrons lose their heat within 0.5 ps
while the lattice temperature rises slowly in 3.5 to 8 ps, leaving a gap of 3-7
ps. We propose that the hidden energy is transiently stored in high-frequency
phonon modes for which diffraction is insensitive and which are excited in 0.5
ps. Within a three-temperature model we use three heat baths, namely electrons,
high-frequency and low-frequency phonon modes to simulate the observations. The
excitation of low-frequency acoustic phonons, i.e., thermalization of the
lattice is facilitated through anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction.

<h3>Gauge symmetry of excited states in projected entangled-pair state  simulations</h3>

<i>Yi Tan, Ji-Yao Chen, Didier Poilblanc, Jia-Wei Mei</i>
<p>While gauge symmetry is a well-established requirement for representing
topological orders in projected entangled-pair state (PEPS), its impact on the
properties of low-lying excited states remains relatively unexplored. Here we
perform PEPS simulations of low-energy dynamics in the Kitaev honeycomb model,
which supports fractionalized gauge flux (vison) excitations. We identify gauge
symmetry emerging upon optimizing an unbiased PEPS ground state. Using the PEPS
adapted local mode approximation, we further classify the low-lying excited
states by discerning different vison sectors. Our simulations of spin and
spin-dimer dynamical correlations establish close connections with experimental
observations. Notably, the selection rule imposed by the locally conserved
visons results in nearly flat dispersions in momentum space for excited states
belonging to the 2-vison or 4-vison sectors.
