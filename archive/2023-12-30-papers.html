<h3>Purity-dependent Lorenz number, electron hydrodynamics and  electron-phonon coupling in WTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16178</a>

<i>Wei Xie, Feng Yang, Liangcai Xu, Xiaokang Li, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia</i>
<p>We present a study of electrical and thermal transport in Weyl semimetal
WTe$_2$ down to 0.3 K. The Wiedemann-Franz law holds below 2 K and a downward
deviation starts above. The deviation is more pronounced in cleaner samples, as
expected in the hydrodynamic picture of electronic transport, where a fraction
of electron-electron collisions conserve momentum. Phonons are the dominant
heat carriers and their mean-free-path do not display a Knudsen minimum. This
is presumably a consequence of weak anharmonicity, as indicated by the
temperature dependence of the specific heat. Frequent momentum exchange between
phonons and electrons leads to quantum oscillations of the phononic thermal
conductivity. Bloch-Gr\"uneisen picture of electron-phonon scattering breaks
down at low temperature when Umklapp ph-ph collisions cease to be a sink for
electronic flow of momentum. Comparison with semi-metallic Sb shows that normal
ph-ph collisions are amplified by anharmonicity. In both semimetals, at
cryogenic temperature, e-ph collisions degrade the phononic flow of energy but
not the electronic flow of momentum.

<h3>Polarization evolution equation for the exchange-strictionally formed  II-type multiferroic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16321</a>

<i>Pavel A. Andreev, Mariya Iv. Trukhanova</i>
<p>The multiferroics are the materials, where single cell of a magnetically
order crystal forms an electric dipole moment. We derive equation for the
evolution of the macroscopic density of the electric dipole moment
(polarization of the system). The derivation is made within the "quantum
hydrodynamic" method, which allows to derive equations for the evolution of the
macroscopic functions of the quantum systems starting with the microscopic
description. In this work we do not consider the microscopic level of
individual electrons and ions, but we start our analysis from the combination
of ions in cells of the crystal. We present an effective Hamiltonian for the
evolution of such intermediate scale objects. We also apply the equation for
the electric dipole moment of the single cell, which is recontracted in the
corresponding operator. Using this operator and the wave function of
combination of ions in the cell, we define the macroscopic density of the
electric dipole moment. Finally, we apply the nonstationary Schrodinger
equation with the chosen Hamiltonian in order to derive equation evolution of
the polarization. The derivation is made for the dipole formed by the
exchange-striction mechanism in the II-type multiferroic materials. The
interaction caused term in the polarization evolution equation is found to be
proportional to the fourth space derivative of mixed product (triple scalar
product) of three spin density vectors. Conditions are discussed for the
regime, where interaction appears in a smaller order on the space derivatives.

<i>Nisarg Bhatt, Subroto Mukerjee, Sriram Ramaswamy</i>
<p>The Hamiltonian nature of the precessional dynamics of the classical
Heisenberg model leads to reciprocal interactions amongst the spins. Heisenberg
spins are reciprocal in nature. In this work, we study the dynamics of a
nonequilibrium classical spin chain in which the neighbours interact through a
purely non-reciprocal exchange coupling [EPL 60, 418 (2002)] which preserves
rotational symmetry. The resultant dynamics conserves neither magnetization nor
energy. We uncover other local conservation laws in their place in the extreme
case of a strictly antisymmetric coupling. We show numerically that the model
undergoes an analogue of thermalization. We present results on the presence of
conserved quantities, their diffusive spreading and a hydrodynamic picture, and
the nature of the decorrelation front upon adding an initial perturbation to
the system.

<h3>Exploration of field-like torque and field-angle tunability in coupled  spin-torque nano oscillators for synchronization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16175" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16175</a>
<br>
<i>R. Arun, R. Gopal, V. K. Chandrasekar, M. Lakshmanan</i>
<p>We investigate the influence of field-like torque and the direction of the
external magnetic field on a one-dimensional array of serially connected
spin-torque nano oscillators, having free layers with perpendicular anisotropy,
to achieve complete synchronization between them by analyzing the associated
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. The obtained results for
synchronization are discussed for the cases of 2, 10 and 100 oscillators
separately. The roles of the field-like torque and the direction of the
external field on the synchronization of the STNOs are explored through the
Kuramoto order parameter. While the field-like torque alone is sufficient to
bring out global synchronization in the system made up of a small number of
STNOs, the direction of the external field is also needed to be slightly tuned
to synchronize the one-dimensional array of a large number of STNOs. The
formation of complete synchronization through the construction of clusters
within the system is identified for the 100 oscillators. The large amplitude
synchronized oscillations are obtained for small to large numbers of
oscillators. Moreover, the tunability in frequency for a wide range of currents
is shown for the synchronized oscillations up to 100 spin-torque oscillators.
In addition to achieving synchronization, the field-like torque increases the
frequency of the synchronized oscillations. The transverse Lyapunov exponents
are deduced to confirm the stable synchronization in coupled STNOs due to the
field-like torque and to validate the results obtained in the numerical
simulations. The output power of the array is estimated to be enhanced
substantially due to complete synchronization by the combined effect of
field-like torque and tunability of the field angle.

<h3>Tunneling-like wave transmission in non-Hermitian lattices with mirrored  nonreciprocity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16182</a>
<br>
<i>Sayan Jana, Lea Sirota</i>
<p>We report a peculiar tunneling-like wave phenomenon that occurs in a
non-Hermitian lattice, which is placed as an interface between two Hermitian
lattices. The non-Hermitian part consists of two sections governed by
nonreciprocal couplings between the sites, where the nonreciprocity is mirrored
between the sections in a way that the weaker couplings are directed toward the
boundary with the Hermitian parts. As a standalone system, which was widely
studied in recent years, each of these sections supports the non-Hermitian skin
effect, in which modes are accumulated at the boundary of the weaker coupling.
Here, we investigate what happens to a wave that propagates along the Hermitian
lattice and hits the interface. Due to the skin mode accumulation a total
reflection from the interface would be expected, but surprisingly, in certain
conditions the wave is transmitted to the other side, keeping the interface
dark, as if the wave invisibly tunneled through it. Remarkably, the tunneling
is independent of the interface length. We derive the phenomenon both for
quantum and classical systems, and realize it experimentally in a non-foster
electric transmission-line metamaterial.

<h3>Nonequilibrium formulation of varying-temperature bit erasure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16195" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16195</a>
<br>
<i>Stephen Whitelam</i>
<p>Landauer's principle states that erasing a bit of information at fixed
temperature T costs at least kT ln 2 units of work. Here we investigate erasure
at varying temperature, to which Landauer's result does not apply. We formulate
bit erasure as a stochastic nonequilibrium process involving a compression of
configuration space, with physical and logical states associated in a symmetric
way. Erasure starts and ends at temperature T, but temperature can otherwise
vary with time in an arbitrary way. Defined in this way, erasure is governed by
a set of nonequilibrium fluctuation relations that show that
varying-temperature erasure can done with less work than k T ln 2. As a result,
erasure and the complementary process of bit randomization can be combined to
form a work-producing engine cycle.

<h3>Massive Klein Tunneling in Topological Photonic Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16207</a>
<br>
<i>Keiji Nakatsugawa, Xiao Hu</i>
<p>Klein's paradox refers to the transmission of a relativistic particle through
a high potential barrier. Although it has a simple resolution in terms of
particle-to-antiparticle tunneling (Klein tunneling), debates on its physical
meaning seem lasting partially due to the lack of direct experimental
verification. In this article, we point out that honeycomb-type photonic
crystals (PhCs) provide an ideal platform to investigate the nature of Klein
tunneling, where the effective Dirac mass can be tuned in a relatively easy way
from a positive value (trivial PhC) to a negative value (topological PhC) via a
zero-mass case (PhC graphene). Especially, we show that analysis of the
transmission between domains with opposite Dirac masses -- a case hardly be
treated within the scheme available so far -- sheds new light on the
understanding of the Klein tunneling.

<h3>Work fluctuation theorems with initial quantum coherence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16227</a>
<br>
<i>Gianluca Francica, Luca Dell'Anna</i>
<p>Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics
beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks
fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward
out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In
particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus
incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial
quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems. To do this, we formulate and
examine the implications of a stronger fluctuation theorem, which reproduces
the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum
coherence.

<h3>Comment on "Shot noise in a strange metal"</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16269" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16269</a>
<br>
<i>V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, G.S. Japaridze</i>
<p>The recent paper (Science 382, 907 (2023)) is devoted to measurements of shot
noise to probe excitations in nanowires of the heavy fermion (HF) metal $\rm
YbRh_2Si_2$. The authors observed that shot noise is strongly suppressed, and
claim that the suppression cannot be attributed to either electron-phonon or
electron-electron interactions in a Fermi liquid. Their observation suggests
that the current is not carried by well-defined quasiparticles in the $\rm
YbRh_2Si_2$, and calls for similar research into other strange metals. In this
comment, we show that it is unlikely that the affected carriers in bulk $\rm
YbRh_2Si_2$ would have undergone any fragmentation.

<h3>Two-particle self-consistent approach for broken symmetry phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16280" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16280</a>
<br>
<i>Lorenzo Del Re</i>
<p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking of interacting fermion systems constitutes a
major challenge for many-body theory due to the proliferation of new
independent scattering channels once absent or degenerate in the symmetric
phase. One example is given by the ferro/antiferromagnetic broken symmetry
phase (BSP) of the Hubbard model, where vertices in the spin-transverse and
spin-longitudinal channels become independent with a consequent increase in the
computational power for their calculation. Here we generalise the formalism of
the non-perturbative Two-Particle-Self-Consistent method (TPSC) to treat broken
SU(2) magnetic phases of the Hubbard model, providing with an efficient yet
reliable method. We show that in the BSP the sum-rule enforcement of
susceptibilities must be accompanied by a modified gap equation resulting in a
renormalisation of the order parameter, vertex corrections and the preservation
of the gap-less feature of the Goldstone modes. We then apply the theory to the
antiferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model in the cubic lattice at
half-filling. We compare our results of double occupancies and staggered
magnetisation to the ones obtained using Diagrammatic Monte Carlo showing good
quantitative agreement. We demonstrate how vertex corrections play a central
role in lowering the Higgs resonance with respect to the quasi-particle
excitation gap in the spin-longitudinal susceptibility, yielding a well visible
Higgs-mode.

<h3>Unraveling PXP Many-Body Scars through Floquet Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16288" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16288</a>
<br>
<i>Giuliano Giudici, Federica Maria Surace, Hannes Pichler</i>
<p>Quantum scars are special eigenstates of many-body systems that evade
thermalization. They were first discovered in the PXP model, a well-known
effective description of Rydberg atom arrays. Despite significant theoretical
efforts, the fundamental origin of PXP scars remains elusive. By investigating
the discretized dynamics of the PXP model as a function of the Trotter step
$\tau$, we uncover a remarkable correspondence between the zero- and
two-particle eigenstates of the integrable Floquet-PXP cellular automaton at
$\tau=\pi/2$ and the PXP many-body scars of the time-continuous limit.
Specifically, we demonstrate that PXP scars are adiabatically connected to the
eigenstates of the $\tau=\pi/2$ Floquet operator. Building on this result, we
propose a protocol for achieving high-fidelity preparation of PXP scars in
Rydberg atom experiments.

<h3>Altermagnetic anomalous Hall effect emerging from electronic  correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16290</a>
<br>
<i>Toshihiro Sato, Sonia Haddad, Ion Cosma Fulga, Fakher F. Assaad, Jeroen van den Brink</i>
<p>While altermagnetic materials are characterized by a vanishing net magnetic
moment, their symmetry in principle allows for the existence of an anomalous
Hall effect (AHE). Here we introduce a model with altermagnetism in which the
emergence of an AHE is driven by interactions. This model is grounded in a
modified Kane-Mele framework with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin
correlations. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations show that the system undergoes a
finite temperature phase transition governed by a primary AFM order parameter
accompanied by a secondary one of Haldane type. The emergence of both orders
turns the metallic state of the system, away from half-filling, to an
altermagnet with a finite anomalous Hall conductivity. A mean field ansatz
corroborates these results, which pave the way into the study of correlation
induced altermagnets with finite Berry curvature.

<h3>On "Nanoscale thermodynamics needs the concept of a disjoining chemical  potential", by W. Dong, Nat. Comm. 10, 1038 (2023)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16329</a>
<br>
<i>Ralph V. Chamberlin</i>
<p>In a 2023 Nature Communication, Dong claims that a disjoining chemical
potential should be used instead of "Hill's nanothermodynamics" because Hill's
subdivision potential "remains elusive to relate...to any experimental
observables." Here, I remind readers of the 2000 Letter to Nature where Hill's
ideas were adapted to provide improved agreement with the non-classical
critical scaling measured in ferromagnetic materials, and where the term
"nanothermodynamics" first appeared. Then, I attempt to reconcile Dong's claim
with the experimental evidence for nanothermodynamics, and suggest how Dong's
results can be improved for measurements on real systems. Because Dong's claim
comes from his failure to recognize the adaptation of Hill's work in the
original Letter, and in dozens of other publications, I propose how the term
nanothermodynamics might be clarified to avoid future confusion.

<h3>The Noise of the Charge Density Waves in NbSe$_3$ Nanowires --  Contributions of Electrons and Quantum Condensate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16359</a>
<br>
<i>Subhajit Ghosh, Sergey Rumyantsev, Alexander A. Balandin</i>
<p>Low-frequency electronic noise in charge-density-wave van der Waals materials
has been an important characteristic, providing information about the material
quality, phase transitions, and collective current transport. However, the
noise sources and mechanisms have not been completely understood, particularly
for the materials with a non-fully gapped Fermi surface where the electrical
current includes components from individual electrons and the sliding
charge-density wave. We investigated noise in nanowires of
quasi-one-dimensional NbSe$_3$, focusing on a temperature range near the Pearls
transition ~ 145 K. The data analysis allowed us to separate the noise produced
by the individual conduction electrons and the quantum condensate of the charge
density waves before and after the onset of sliding. The noise as a function of
temperature and electric bias reveals several intriguing peaks. We explained
the observed features by the depinning threshold field, the creep and sliding
of the charge density waves, and the possible existence of the hidden phases.
It was found that the charge density wave condensate is particularly noisy at
the moment of depinning. The noise of the collective current reduces with the
increasing bias voltage in contrast to the noise of the individual electrons.
Our results shed light on the behavior of the charge density wave quantum
condensate and demonstrate the potential of noise spectroscopy for
investigating the properties of low-dimensional quantum materials.

<p>Quaternary chalcogenide compositions have been broadly explored due to their
promising potential for various optoelectronic applications. The band
structure, density of states and optical properties of CuZn2InS4 and CuZn2GaS4
for kesterite and stannite structures were studied with full potential

equilibrium was calculated for different possible crystal structures and their
phase stability, and transitions with p-d orbitals were analyzed. The
absorption coefficient, dielectric function, and refractive index of these
materials were also explored within a broad range of energy. We compared the
calculated band gap values with available experimental results.

<h3>Dome structure in pressure dependence of superconducting transition  temperature for HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_8$ -- Studies by $ab$ $initio$  low-energy effective Hamiltonian</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16402</a>
<br>
<i>Jean-Baptiste Morée, Youhei Yamaji, Masatoshi Imada</i>
<p>The superconducting (SC) cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_8$ (Hg1223) has the
highest $T_{c}^{\rm opt}\simeq 138$ K (the experimental SC transition
temperature at optimal hole doping) among cuprates at ambient pressure $P_{\rm
amb}$. $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ increases under pressure $P$ and reaches $164$ K at
$P_{\rm opt}\simeq 30$ GPa, then decreases with increasing $P>P_{\rm opt}$. To
understand the microscopic origin of this dome-like $P$ dependence of
$T_{c}^{\rm opt}$, we consider the $ab$ $initio$ low-energy effective
Hamiltonian (LEH) for the antibonding (AB) Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$/O$2p_{\sigma}$
band. In the AB LEH for cuprates with $N_\ell \leq 2$ laminated CuO$_2$ planes
between block layers, it was proposed that $T_{c}^{\rm opt}\simeq
0.16|t_1|F_{\rm SC}$, where $t_1$ is the nearest neighbor hopping and the SC
order parameter $F_{\rm SC}$ at optimal hole doping mainly depends on
$u=U/|t_1|$ ($U$ is the onsite effective Coulomb repulsion): $F_{\rm SC}$ is
maximal at $u_{\rm opt}\simeq 8.5$ and decreases sharply with decreasing $u$
for $u<u_{\rm opt}$. In this paper, we show that (I) $|t_1|$ increases with
$P$, whereas (II) $u$ decreases with $P$ in the AB LEH of Hg1223. Based on
(I,II), the dome-like $P$ dependence of $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ emerges if we assume
(A) Hg1223 with $N_\ell =3$ obeys $T_{c}^{\rm opt}\simeq 0.16|t_1|F_{\rm SC}$,
and (B) $u\gtrsim u_{\rm opt}$ at $P_{\rm amb}$ and $u\simeq u_{\rm opt}$ at
$P_{\rm opt}$ by including expected corrections to our $ab$ $initio$
calculation. The consequence of (A,B) is the following: At $P<P_{\rm opt}$, the
increase in $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ is accounted for by (I) whereas $F_{\rm SC}$ is
insensitive to (II) and hence to $P$. At $P>P_{\rm opt}$, the decrease in
$T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ is accounted for by (II): The rapid decrease in $F_{\rm SC}$
with decreasing $u$ for $u<u_{\rm opt}$ dominates over (I). We support (A,B)
based on studies of other cuprates.

<h3>Optical probe on doping modulation of magnetic Weyl semimetal  Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</h3>

<i>L. Wang, S. Zhang, B. B. Wang, B. X. Gao, L. Y. Cao, X. T. Zhang, X. Y. Zhang, E. K. Liu, R. Y. Chen</i>
<p>The magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is extensively investigated due
to its giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE).Recent studies demonstrate that the
AHE can be effectively tuned by multi-electron Ni doping.To reveal the
underlying mechanism of this significant manipulation,it is crucial to explore
the band structure modification caused by Ni doping. Here,we study the
electrodynamics of both pristine and Ni-doped Co$_{3-x}$Ni$_x$Sn$_2$S$_2$ with
$x=$0, 0.11 and 0.17 by infrared spectroscopy. We find that the inverted energy
gap around the Fermi level(EF) gets smaller at x=0.11,which is supposed to
enhance the Berry curvature and therefore increase the AHE.Then EF moves out of
this gap at x=0.17. Additionally,the low temperature carrier density is
demonstrated to increase monotonically upon doping,which is different from
previous Hall measurement results. We also observe the evidences of band
broadening and exotic changes of high-energy interband transitions caused by
doping.Our results provide detailed information about the band structure of
Co$_{3-x}$Ni$_x$Sn$_2$S$_2$ at different doping levels,which will help to guide
further studies on the chemical tuning of AHE.

<h3>High Capacity Hydrogen Storage on Zirconium decorated γ-graphyne:  A systematic first-principles study</h3>

<br>
<i>Mukesh Singh, Alok Shukla, Brahmananda Chakraborty</i>
<p>In this work, we investigate the hydrogen-storage properties of Zr-decorated
$\gamma$-graphyne monolayer employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) for green
energy storage. We predict that each Zr atom decorated on graphyne sheet (2D)
can adsorb up to seven H$_2$ molecules with an average adsorption energy of
-0.44 eV/H$_2$, leading to a hydrogen gravimetric density of 7.95 wt%, and
desorption temperature of 574 K, particularly suited to fuel-cell applications.
Decorated Zr atom strongly attached to graphyne due to charge transfer from Zr
to graphyne sheet. Hydrogen molecules adsorb on Zr decorated graphyne with
Kubas type of interaction. The 4.05 eV diffusion energy barrier between Zr
decorated position, and its neighboring pores may avoid the metal-metal (Zr-Zr)
clustering. The stability of Zr+$\gamma$-graphyne is confirmed by performing
ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations at room temperature and at estimated
average desorption temperature. Hence, our calculations show Zr functionalized
on $\gamma$-graphyne could be a promising solid-state hydrogen storage
material.

<p>We conducted a comparative study of the rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates
films, RNiO2 (R = La, Pr, and Nd) using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
(RIXS). We found that the gross features of the orbital configurations are
essentially the same, with minor variations in the detailed hybridization. For
low-energy excitations, we unambiguously confirm the presence of damped
magnetic excitations in all three compounds. By fitting to a linear spin-wave
theory, comparable spin exchange coupling strengths and damping coefficients
are extracted, indicating a universal magnetic structure in the infinite-layer
nickelates. Interestingly, while signatures of a charge order are observed in
LaNiO2 in the quasi-elastic region of the RIXS spectrum, it is absent in NdNiO2
and PrNiO2. This prompts further investigation into the universality and the
origins of charge order within the infinite-layer inickelates.

<h3>Hard X-ray Generation and Detection of Nanometer-Scale Localized  Coherent Acoustic Wave Packets in SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$</h3>

<p>We demonstrate that the absorption of femtosecond x-ray pulses can excite
quasi-spherical high-wavevector coherent acoustic phonon wavepackets using an
all x-ray pump and probe scattering experiment. The time- and momentum-resolved
diffuse scattering signal is consistent with strain pulses induced by the rapid
electron cascade dynamics following photoionization at uncorrelated excitation
centers. We quantify key parameters of this process, including the localization
size of the strain wavepacket and the energy absorption efficiency, which are
determined by the photoelectron and Auger electron cascade dynamics, as well as
the electron-phonon interaction. In particular, we obtain the localization size
of the observed strain wave packet to be 1.5 and 2.5 nm for bulk SrTiO$_3$ and
KTaO$_3$ single crystals, even though there are no nanoscale structures or
light-intensity patterns that would ordinarily be required to generate acoustic
waves of wavelengths much shorter than the penetration depth. Whereas in GaAs
and GaP we do not observe a signal above background. The results provide
crucial information on x-ray matter interactions, which sheds light on the
mechanism of x-ray energy deposition, and the study of high wavevector acoustic
phonons and thermal transport at the nanoscale.

<h3>Emergence of superconductivity near 11 K by suppressing the 3-fold  helical-chain structure in noncentrosymmetric HgS</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16484" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16484</a>
<br>
<i>He Zhang, Wei Zhong, Yanghao Meng, Bowen Tang, Binbin Yue, Xiaohui Yu, Fang Hong</i>
<p>The trigonal ${\alpha}$-HgS has a 3-fold helical chain structure, and is in
form of a noncentrosymmetric $P3_121$ phase, known as the cinnabar phase.
However, under pressure, the helical chains gradually approach and connect with
each other, finally reconstructing into a centrosymmetric NaCl structure at 21
GPa. Superconductivity emerges just after this helical-nonhelical structural
transition. The maximum critical temperature ($T_c$) reaches 11 K at 25.4 GPa,
$T_c$ decreases with further compression, and is still 3.5 K at 44.8 GPa.
Furthermore, the $T_c$-critical magnetic field ($B_{c2}$) relation exhibits
multi-band features, with a $B_{c2}$ of 5.65 T at 0 K by two-band fitting.
Raman spectra analysis demonstrates that phonon softening plays a key role in
structural transition and the emergence of superconductivity. It is noted that
HgS is the first reported IIB group metal sulfide superconductor and the only
NaCl-type metal sulfide superconductor with a $T_c$ above 10 K. This work will
inspire the exploration of superconductivity in other chiral systems and will
extend our understanding of the versatile behavior in such kinds of materials.

<i>Yu. Dzhezherya, P. Polynchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski</i>
<p>We investigate the switching of a magnetic nanoparticle comprising the middle
free layer of a memory cell based on a double magnetic tunnel junction under
the combined effect of spin-polarized current and weak on-chip magnetic field.
We obtain the timing and amplitude parameters for the current and field pulses
needed to achieve 100 ps range \emph{inertia-free} switching under
\emph{least-power} dissipation. The considered method does not rely on the
stochastics of thermal agitation of the magnetic nanoparticle typically
accompanying spin-torque switching. The regime of ultimate switching
speed-efficiency found in this work is promising for applications in
high-performance nonvolatile memory.

<p>We performed time-resolved pump--probe measurements using rare-earth iron
garnet \ce{Gd3/2Yb1/2BiFe5O12} as a two-sublattice ferrimagnet. We measured the
initial phases of the magnetic resonance modes below and above the
magnetization compensation temperature to clarify the sublattice selectivity of
the inverse Faraday effect in ferrimagnets. A comparison of the time evolution
of magnetization estimated using the equations of motion revealed that the
inverse Faraday effect occurring in ferrimagnetic materials has sublattice
selectivity. This is in striking contrast to antiferromagnets, in which the
inverse Faraday effect acts on each sublattice identically. The initial phase
analysis can be applied to other ferrimagnets with compensation temperatures.

<h3>Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a  Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</h3>

<br>
<i>Matthew T. Wheeler, Hayder Salman, Magnus O. Borgh</i>
<p>Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of
topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In
second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal
approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as
a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase
transition can be understood from generic properties. We generalize the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset
of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number
of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a
one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase
transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field
numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of
metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.

<p>The role of anyonic statistics stands as a cornerstone in the landscape of
topological quantum techniques. While recent years have brought forth
encouraging and persuasive strides in detecting anyons, a significant facet
remains unexplored, especially in view of connecting anyonic physics to quantum
information platforms-whether and how entanglement can be generated by anyonic
braiding. Here, we demonstrate that even if the two anyonic subsystems are
connected only by electron tunneling, anyonic entanglement, manifesting
fractional statistics, is generated. Specifically, we address this question for
fractional quantum Hall edges bridged by a quantum point contact that allows
only transmission of fermions (so-called Andreev-like tunneling), invoking the
physics of two-beam collisions in an anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel collider We define
an entanglement pointer-a current-noise-based function tailored to quantify
entanglement and show that it reflects the role of quasiparticle statistics. A
striking feature of our statistics-induced-entanglement pointer is its relative
resilience to entanglement stemming from electrostatic interactions between the
two anyonic subsystems.

<h3>tda-segmentor: A tool to extract and analyze local structure and  porosity features in porous materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Aditya Vasudevan, Jorge Zorrilla Prieto, Sergei Zorkaltsev, Maciej Haranczyk</i>
<p>Local geometrical features of a porous material such as the shape and size of
a pore or the curvature of a solid ligament often affect the macroscopic
properties of the material, and their characterization is necessary to fully
understand the structure-property relationships.In this contribution, we
present an approach to automatically segment large porous structures into such
local features. Our work takes inspiration from techniques available in
Topological Data Analysis(TDA).In particular, using Morse theory, we generate
Morse-Smale Complexes(MSC) of our structures that segment the structure, and/or
its porosity into individual features that can then be compared. We develop a
tool that is built on the topology toolkit (TTK) library, an open source
platform for the topological analysis of scalar data, with which we can perform
segmentation of these structures. Our tool takes a volumetric grid
representation as an input, which can be generated from atomistic or mesh
structure models and any function defined on such grid, e.g. the distance to
the surface or the interaction energy with a probe. We demonstrate the
applicability of the tool by two examples related with analysis of porosity in
zeolite materials as well as analysis of ligaments in a porous metal structure.
Specifically, by segmenting the pores in the structure we demonstrate some
applications to zeolites such as assessing pore-similarity between structures
or evaluating the accessible volume to a target molecule such as methane that
can be adsorbed to its surface. Moreover, once the MSC's are generated, we can
construct graph representations of the void space, replacing the entire pore
structure by a simply connected graph. Similarly, the same tool is used to
segment and generate graphs representing the solid structure and we show how
they can be used to correlate structure and mechanical properties of the
material.

<h3>Disorder driven Thouless charge pump in a quasiperiodic chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16568</a>
<br>
<i>Ashirbad Padhan, Tapan Mishra</i>
<p>Thouless charge pump enables a quantized transport of charge through an
adiabatic evolution of the Hamiltonian exhibiting topological phase. While this
charge pumping is known to be robust against the presence of weak disorder in
the system, it often breaks down with the increase in disorder strength. In
this work, however, we show that in a one dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
lattice, a unit cell-wise staggered quasiperiodic disorder favors a quantized
charge pump. Moreover, we show that such quantized Thouless charge pump is
achieved by following the standard single cycle pumping protocol which usually
leads to a breakdown of charge pump in other known models. This unusual
property is found to be due to an emergence of a trivial gapped phase from a
topological phase as the quasiperiodic disorder is tuned. This emergent gapped
to gapped transition also allows us to propose a non-standard pumping scheme
where a modulated disorder favors a quantized Thouless charge pump.

<p>The study investigates the density, phase composition, microstructure and
mechanical properties (microhardness, fracture toughness) of binderless WC +
SiC and WC + SiC + C ceramics obtained by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS).
Nanopowders of a-WC produced by DC arc plasma chemical synthesis were used as
raw materials. Powder compositions for sintering contained graphite (0.3, 0.5%
wt.) or b-SiC (1, 3, 5% wt.) with 0.3% wt. graphite. It was shown that WC + 1%
wt. SiC + 0.3% wt.C ceramics have a homogeneous fine-grained microstructure,
high relative density, increased microhardness and Palmquist fracture toughness
(Indentation Fracture Resistance). The kinetics of the initial sintering stage
of WC + C and WC + C + SiC powder compositions was also analyzed using
high-temperature dilatometry at the conventional pressureless sintering (CPS)
conditions. The CPS and SPS activation energies of WC + SiC powder at the
intensive shrinkage stage were determined using the Young-Cutler model. The CPS
activation energies of WC, WC + C and WC + C + SiC powder compositions are
close to the activation energy of diffusion of the carbon C along the a-WC
grain boundaries. The SPS activation energies of WC + C and WC+ C + SiC powder
compositions turn out to be lower than the activation energy of the C of a-WC
grain boundary.

<h3>Limitations on the maximal level of entanglement of two singlet-triplet  qubits in GaAs quantum dots</h3>

<br>
<i>Igor Bragar, Łukasz Cywiński</i>
<p>We analyze in detail a procedure of entangling of two singlet-triplet
($S$-$T_{0}$) qubits operated in a regime when energy associated with the
magnetic field gradient, $\Delta B_{z}$, is an order of magnitude smaller than
the exchange energy, $J$, between singlet and triplet states [Shulman M. et
al., Science 336, 202 (2012)]. We have studied theoretically a single
$S$-$T_{0}$ qubit in free induction decay and spin echo experiments. We have
obtained analytical expressions for time dependence of components of its Bloch
vector for quasistatical fluctuations of $\Delta B_{z}$ and quasistatical or
dynamical $1/f^{\beta}$-type fluctuations of $J$. We have then considered the
impact of fluctuations of these parameters on the efficiency of the entangling
procedure which uses an Ising-type coupling between two $S$-$T_{0}$ qubits.
Particularly, we have obtained an analytical expression for evolution of two
qubits affected by $1/f^{\beta}$-type fluctuations of $J$. This expression
indicates the maximal level of entanglement that can be generated by performing
the entangling procedure. Our results deliver also an evidence that in the
above-mentioned experiment, the $S$-$T_{0}$ qubits were affected by
uncorrelated $1/f^{\beta}$ charge noises.

<h3>Topological phase transitions induced by the variation of exchange  couplings in graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Jihyeon Park, Gun Sang Jeon</i>
<p>We consider a modified graphene model under exchange couplings. Various
quantum anomalous phases are known to emerge under uniform or staggered
exchange couplings. We introduce the twist between the orientations of two
sublattice exchange couplings, which is useful for examining how such
topologically nontrivial phases under different types of exchange couplings are
connected to one another. The phase diagrams constructed by the variation of
exchange coupling strengths and twist angles exhibit rich structures of
successive topological transitions. We analyze the emergence of peculiar phases
in terms of the evolution of the energy dispersions. Perturbation schemes
applied to the energy levels turn out to reproduce well phase boundary lines up
to moderate values of the twist angle. We also discover two close topological
transitions under uniform exchange couplings, which is attributed to the
interplay of the trigonal-warping deformation due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling
and the staggered sublattice potential. Finally the implications of Berry
curvature structure and topological excitations in real and pseudo spin
textures are discussed.

<p>Dopant impurity potentials determined by ab-initio supercell DFT calculations
are used to calculate the optical conductivity of overdoped LSCO and Tl-2201 in
the superconducting and normal states. Vertex corrections are included, to
account for the effect of forward scattering on two-particle properties. This
approach was previously shown to provide good, semiquantitative agreement with
measurements of superfluid density in LSCO. Here we compare calculations of
conductivity with measurements of THz conductivity on LSCO using identical
impurity, band, and correlation parameters, and find similarly good
correspondence with experiment. In the process, we delineate the impact of the
different disorder mechanisms on single-particle and transport relaxation
processes. In particular, we reveal the critical role of apical oxygen
vacancies in transport scattering and show that transport relaxation rates in
LSCO are significantly reduced when apical oxygen vacancies are annealed out.
These considerations are shown to be crucial for understanding the variability
of experimental results on overdoped LSCO in samples of nominally identical
doping but different types. Finally, we give predictions for Tl-2201 THz
conductivity experiments.

<p>We study thermalization and thermal transport in single crystals of
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the CDW transition by directly measuring thermal
diffusivity ($D$), thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), resistivity ($\rho$), and
specific heat ($c$). Commensurate with previous reports, we observe a sharp,
narrow anomaly in specific heat associated with a first order transition that
results in a CDW state below $\sim94$ K. While a corresponding sharp anomaly in
thermal diffusivity is also observed, resistivity and thermal conductivity only
exhibit small steps at the transition, where the feature is sharp for
resistivity and broader for thermal conductivity. Scrutinizing the thermal
Einstein relation $\kappa=cD$, we find that this relation is satisfied in the
entire temperature range, except in a narrow range around the transition. The
Wiedemann-Franz law seems to work outside the critical region as well. Below
the transition and persisting below the two-phase regime we find strong
resemblance between the resistivity anomaly and the specific heat, which may
point to a secondary electronic order parameter that emerges continuously below
the transition.

<br>
<i>D. J. G. Pearce, C. Thibault, Q. Chaboche, C. Blanch-Mercader</i>
<p>Topological defects are ubiquitous on surfaces with orientational order
fields. Here, we study equilibrium states generated by the feedback between
geometry and nematic order on fluid membranes with an integer topological
defect. When the Frank elastic constants associated with the orientational
field dominate, the surfaces spontaneously deform toward an conical shape
featuring an aster topological defect at its apex. In the case of vanishing
tension this is a solution to the normal force balance. We show that the
stability of the surface depends on the balance of the elastic parameters and
the phase of the defect. When boundary constraints are introduced, we observe
three distinct modes of deformation. These deformation modes take advantage of
the way in which splay, twist and bend distortions of the director field can be
exchanged on a curved surface. We discuss how these deformation modes are
distinguished by their response to the cost of twist distortions and the
existence of inverted solutions. Our findings show that fusion of +1/2
topological defect pairs can reduce the total energy of deformable surfaces.
Finally, we argue how these results can be relevant for biological systems.

<br>
<i>Chenan Wei, Vagharsh V. Mkhitaryan, Tigran A. Sedrakyan</i>
<p>We study the low-energy properties of the chiral Heisenberg chain, namely, a
one-dimensional spin-1/2 isotropic Heisenberg chain with time-reversal
symmetry-breaking pseudo-scalar chiral interaction. We employ the thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz to find "chiralization", the response of the ground state versus
the strength of the chiral interaction of a chiral Heisenberg chain. Unlike the
magnetization case, the chirality of the ground state remains zero until the
transition point corresponding to critical coupling $\alpha_c=2J/\pi$ with $J$
being the antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The central-charge $c=1$
conformal field theories (CFTs) describe the two phases with zero and finite
chirality. We suggest that the difference lies in the symmetry of their ground
state (lightest weight) primary fields, i.e., the two phases are
symmetry-enriched CFTs. At finite but small temperatures, the non-chiral
Heisenberg phase acquires a finite chirality that scales with the temperature
quadratically. We show that the finite-size effect around the transition point
probes the transition.

<p>Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a new platform for studying strongly
correlated quantum phenomena, but these systems have been largely limited to
van der Waals layer two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here we introduce moir\'e
superlattices leveraging ultra-thin, ligand-free halide perovskites,
facilitated by ionic interactions. Square moir\'e superlattices with varying
periodic lengths are clearly visualized through high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy. Twist-angle-dependent transient photoluminescence
microscopy and electrical characterizations indicate the emergence of localized
bright excitons and trapped charge carriers near a twist angle of ~10{\deg}.
The localized excitons are accompanied by enhanced exciton emission, attributed
to an increased oscillator strength by a theoretically forecasted flat band.
This work illustrates the potential of extended ionic interaction in realizing
moir\'e physics at room temperature, broadening the horizon for future
investigations.

<p>Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) in a glass matrix combine excellent
optical properties and stability against environment. Spectral and temporal
characteristics of photoluminescence from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsPb(Cl,Br)$_3$ NCs in
a fluorophosphate glass matrix are measured in a temperature range from 6 to
270 K in order to reveal factors limiting their quantum yield and recombination
dynamics. At low temperatures the recombination dynamics are characterized by
three times on the order of 1 ns, 10 ns, and 1 $\mu$s. Relative contributions
of the corresponding processes and their times are strongly temperature
dependent. Emission intensity decreases with growing temperature and this
effect is stronger in smaller NCs highlighting the role of the surface states.
Model considerations accounting for the NC energy structure and presence of the
surface states trapping electrons and hole are provided to describe
experimental appearances. We conclude that the photoluminescence dynamics at
low temperatures are dominated by carrier recombination and relaxation to
shallow traps. At temperatures exceeding 100 K, the dynamics are affected by
activation of carriers to the excited states.

<p>We investigate the phases and phase transitions of the disordered Haldane
model in the presence of on-site disorder. We use the real-space Chern marker
and transfer matrices to extract critical exponents over a broad range of
parameters. The disorder-driven transitions are consistent with the plateau
transitions in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE), in conformity with
recent simulations of disordered Dirac fermions. Our numerical findings are
compatible with an additional line of mass-driven transitions with a
continuously varying correlation length exponent. The values interpolate
between free Dirac fermions and the IQHE with increasing disorder strength. We
also show that the fluctuations of the Chern marker exhibit a power-law
divergence in the vicinity of both sets of transitions, yielding another
varying exponent. We discuss the interpretation of these results.

<h3>Latent electronic (anti-)ferroelectricity in BiNiO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<i>Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Philippe Ghosez</i>
<p>BiNiO$_3$ exhibits an unusual metal-insulator transition from $Pnma$ to
$P\overline{1}$ that is related to charge ordering at the Bi sites, which is
intriguingly distinct from the charge ordering at Ni sites usually observed in
related rare-earth nickelates. Here, using first principles calculations, we
first rationalize the phase transition from $Pnma$ to $P\overline{1}$,
revealing an overlooked intermediate $P2_1/m$ phase and a very unusual phase
transition mechanism. Going further, we point out that the charge ordering at
Bi sites in the $P\overline{1}$ phase is not unique. We highlight an
alternative polar orderings giving rise to a ferroelectric $Pmn2_1$ phase
nearly degenerated in energy with $P\overline{1}$ and showing an in-plane
electric polarisation of 53 $\mu C $/cm$^2$ directly resulting from the charge
ordering. The close energy of $Pmn2_1$ and $P\overline{1}$ phases, together
with low energy barrier between them, make BiNiO$_3$ a potential electronic
antiferroelectric in which the field-induced transition from non-polar to polar
would relate to non-adiabatic inter-site electron transfer. We also demonstrate
the possibility to stabilize an electronic ferroelectric ground state from
strain engineering in thin films, using an appropriate substrate

<br>
<i>Giuseppe Cuono, Carmine Autieri, Tomasz Dietl</i>
<p>Using first principle calculations we examine properties of (Cd,V)Te,
(Cd,Cr)Te, (Hg,V)Te, and (Hg,Cr)Te relevant to the quantum anomalous Hall
effect (QAHE), such as the position of V- and Cr- derived energy levels and the
exchange interactions between magnetic ions. We consider CdTe and HgTe,
containing 12.5% of cation-substitutional V or Cr ions in comparison to the
well-known case of (Cd,Mn)Te and (Hg,Mn)Te, and examine their suitability for
the fabrication of ferromagnetic barriers or ferromagnetic topological quantum
wells, respectively. To account for the strong correlation of transition metal
d electrons we employ hybrid functionals with different mixing parameters aHSE
focusing on aHSE = 0.32, which better reproduces the experimental band gaps in
HgTe, CdTe, Hg0.875Mn0.125Te, and Cd0.875Mn0.125Te. We find that Cr, like Mn,
acts as an isoelectronic dopant but V can be an in-gap donor in CdTe and a
resonant donor in HgTe, similar to the case of Fe in HgSe. From the magnetic
point of view, Cr-doping results in a ferromagnetic phase within the general
gradient approximation (GGA) but interactions become antiferromagnetic within
hybrid functionals. However, (Hg,V)Te is a ferromagnet within both
exchange-correlation functionals in a stark contrast to (Hg,Mn)Te for which
robust antiferromagnetic coupling is found theoretically and experimentally.
Furthermore, we establish that the Jahn-Teller effect is relevant only in the
case of Cr-doping. Considering lower defect concentrations in HgTe-based
quantum wells compared to (Bi,Sb)3Te2 layers, our results imply that HgTe
quantum wells or (Cd,Hg)Te barriers containing either V or Cr show advantages
over (Bi,Sb,Cr,V)3Te2-based QAHE systems but whether (i) ferromagnetic coupling
will dominate in the Cr case and (ii) V will not introduce too many electrons
to the quantum well is to be checked experimentally

<p>Unexpected, yet useful functionalities emerge when two or more materials
merge coherently. Artificial oxide superlattices realize atomic and crystal
structures that are not available in nature, thus providing controllable
correlated quantum phenomena. This review focuses on 4d and 5d oxide
superlattices, in which the spin-orbit coupling plays a significant role
compared with conventional 3d oxide superlattices. Modulations in crystal
structures with octahedral distortion, phonon engineering, electronic
structures, spin orderings, and dimensionality control are discussed for 4d
oxide superlattices. Atomic and magnetic structures, Jeff = 1/2 pseudospin and
charge fluctuations, and the integration of topology and correlation are
discussed for 5d oxide superlattices. This review provides insights into how
correlated quantum phenomena arise from the deliberate design of superlattice
structures that give birth to novel functionalities.

<h3>Collective octahedral tilting in ultrathin Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite  under terahertz light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16757</a>

<i>Kun Liu, Jian Zhou</i>
<p>Perovskites have been applied in a wide range of fields such as solar cells
and non-volatile memories due to their multiferroic nature and excellent
photo-electric conversion capabilities. Recently, two-dimensional (2D)
perovskites with a few atomic layers have been successfully synthesized,
attracting significant attention for potential applications. In this work, we
perform first-principles calculations to investigate an ultrathin prototypical
Ruddlesden-Popper phase, $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{FeO}_4$, with its thickness down
to one unit cell. We show that this compound could exist in two (meta-)stable
octahedral tilting phases, belonging to $P2_1/c$ and $C2/m$ space groups,
respectively. Using the optomechanical theory, we suggest that reversible and
non-volatile phase switching can be triggered using non-destructive terahertz
light. In addition, the two phases show distinct optical reflectance spectrum
in the visible light range, which can be used as an optical probe for phase
transformation. This enables both "write" and "read" in an all-optical route.

<p>Zero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQD) dispersed in conducting polymer
matrix display a striking range of optical, mechanical, and thermoelectric
properties which can be utilized to design next-generation sensors and low-cost
thermoelectric. This exotic electrical property in GQDs is achieved by
exploiting the concentration of the GQDs and by tailoring the functionalization
of the GQDs. However, despite extensive investigation, the nonlinear
resistivity behavior leading to memristive like characteristic has not been
explored much. Here, we report electrical characterisation of nitrogen
functionalized GQD (NGQD) embedded in a polyaniline (PANI) matrix. We observe a
strong dependence of the resistance on current and voltage history, the
magnitude of which depends on the NGQD concentration and temperature. We
explain this memristive property using a phenomenological model of the
alignment of PANI rods with a corresponding charge accumulation arising from
the NGQD on its surface. The NGQD-PANI system is unique in its ability to
matrix offers a unique pathway to design neuromorphic logic and synaptic
architectures with crucial advantages over existing systems.

<h3>Strong four-phonon processes on thermal conductivity of two-dimensional  materials in the low-temperature region</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16761" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16761</a>

<i>H. F. Feng, B. Liu, Zhi-Xin Guo</i>
<p>First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from
perturbation theory have achieved significant success. In general, it only
includes three-phonon (3ph) scattering. However, recent studies have revealed
that four-phonon (4ph) scattering, treated under single-mode relaxation time
approximation (RTA), has a comparable impact to 3ph scattering at medium and
high temperatures in various materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D)
materials. Nonetheless, the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low
temperatures has not been explored so far, owing to the assumption that 4ph
processes are generally insignificant at low temperatures. By combining the
first-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that there are
unusually strong 4ph processes in the low-frequency range of 2D materials such
as h-XN (X=B, Al, Ga), which have remarkable influence on the low-temperature
TC. We also find that the strong 4ph processes are originated from the flexural
out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. We further discover the
remarkable normal (N) processes of 4ph scattering in 2D materials, which make
the conventionally adopted perturbation methods for TC calculation far from
sufficient at low temperatures. Finally, we find that the intensity of 4ph
scattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the
dispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain
engineering. Our study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon
transport and its manipulation in 2D materials.

<h3>Collective spin oscillations in a magnetized graphene sheet</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Agarwal, O. A. Starykh, D. A. Pesin, E. G. Mishchenko</i>
<p>We investigate collective spin excitations of graphene electrons with
short-ranged interactions and subject to the external Zeeman magnetic field. We
find that in addition to the familiar Silin spin wave, a collective spin-flip
excitation that reduces to the uniform precession when the wave's momentum
approaches zero, the magnetized graphene supports another collective mode
visible in the transverse spin susceptibility: a collective spin-current mode.
Unlike the Silin wave, this mode is not dictated by the spin-rotational
symmetry but rather owns its existence to the pseudo-spin structure of the
graphene lattice. We find the new collective excitation to become sharply
defined in a finite interval of wave's momenta, the range of which is
determined by the interaction and the magnetization.

<h3>Statistical domain wall roughness analysis through correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16802" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16802</a>
<br>
<i>P. Domenichini, G. Pasquini, M.G. Capeluto</i>
<p>The geometry and morphology of magnetic domain walls (DWs) are closely
related to their dynamics when driven by external forces. Under some reliable
approximations DWs can be considered self-affine interfaces, so universal laws
govern their behavior. On the other hand, large-scale DW structure has been
less explored so far. Recently, it has been shown that bubble-like magnetic
domains can be strongly deformed on a large scale by applying alternating (ac)
magnetic field pulses. In the present work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis
of DW structure at both small and large length scales in bubble-like domains
present in ferromagnetic thin films with perpendicular anisotropy, focusing on
its initial evolution under the application of ac magnetic pulses. Results
obtained from the widely used roughness correlation function B(r) and its
corresponding structure factor, are consistent with those obtained from the
spatial autocorrelation function of DW fluctuations. Whereas the roughness
exponent slightly increases during the ac evolution, a strong deformation is
observed at a large scale, where a striking periodicity (statistically
speaking) is observed. This period is probably determined by the boundary
conditions and a characteristic intrinsic length.

<h3>Antiferroelectric Oxide Thin-Films: Fundamentals, Properties, and  Applications</h3>

<br>
<i>Yangyang Si, Tianfu Zhang, Chenhan Liu, Sujit Das, Bin Xu, Roman G Burkovsky, Xian-Kui Wei, Zuhuang Chen</i>
<p>Antiferroelectrics have received blooming interests because of a wide range
of potential applications in energy storage, solid-state cooling, thermal
switch, transducer, actuation, and memory devices. Many of those applications
are the most prospective in thin film form. The antiferroelectric ordering in
thin films is highly sensitive to a rich set of factors, such as lattice
strain, film thickness, surface and interface effects as well as film
stoichiometry. To unlock the full potential of these materials and design
high-quality thin films for functional devices, a comprehensive and systematic
understanding of their behavior is essential. In conjunction with the necessary
fundamental background of antiferroelectrics, we review recent progress on
various antiferroelectric oxide thin films, the key parameters that trigger
their phase transition and the device applications that rely on the robust
responses to electric, thermal, and optical stimuli. Current challenges and
future perspectives highlight new and emerging research directions in this
field. It is hoped that this review can boost the development of
antiferroelectric thin-film materials and device design, stimulating more
researchers to explore the unknowns together.

<h3>Influence of Dynamical Floquet Spectrum on the Plasmon Excitations and  Exchange Energy of tilted monolayer 1T$^\prime$MoS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16825" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16825</a>
<br>
<i>Sita Kandel, Godfrey Gumbs, Antonios Balassis, Andrii Iurov, Oleksiy Roslyak</i>
<p>It is now well established that a high-frequency electromagnetic dressing
field within the off-resonance regime significantly modifies the electronic
transport and optical properties on Dirac materials. Here, using light with
circular polarization, we investigate its effect on the energy spectrum of
tilted monolayer 1T$^\prime$MoS$_2$ which acquires two energy gaps associated
with up- and down- pseudospin. We can adjust its electronic properties over a
wider range by varying these two band gaps in contrast with graphene. With the
use of the Lindhard approach for the frequency-dependent polarizability
propagator, we have developed a rigorous theoretical formalism for employing
the Floquet energy spectrum for investigating the many-body effects on the
plasmon excitations, their lifetimes due to Landau damping and the exchange
energy of tilted monolayer 1T$^\prime$MoS$_2$ under normal incidence of
electromagnetic radiation at arbitrary temperature. The dressed states at very
low temperature corresponding to circular polarization suppress the response of
the system to the external probe. This gives rise to the weak but long lived
plasmon excitations at small wavenumber $q$ when compared to the plasmon
spectrum in this regime in the absence of irradiation. However,
$\sqrt{qT}$-dependent plasmons are restored at high temperatures. Our
calculations have shown that the tilting, anisotropy, direct and indirect band
gaps lead to a reduced exchange energy, which has some potential applications
such as, tunability of exciton polariton and plasmon excitations.

<p>In this work, we demonstrate the enlargement of the memory window of Si
channel FeFET with ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 by gate-side dielectric
interlayer engineering. By inserting an Al2O3 dielectric interlayer between TiN
gate metal and ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, we achieve a memory window of 3.2 V
with endurance of ~105 cycles and retention over 10 years. The physical origin
of memory window enlargement is clarified to be charge trapping at the
Al2O3/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 interface, which has an opposite charge polarity to the
trapped charges at the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiOx interface.

<br>
<i>Daniel Massatt, Stephen P. Shipman, Ilya Vekhter, Justin H. Wilson</i>
<p>We uncover a new class of bound states in the continuum in bilayer graphene,
which emerges independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of
freedom. Through a comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene,
we demonstrate that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic
structure of the Hamiltonian rather than any specific underlying symmetry. This
discovery paves the way for innovative approaches in defect and band-structure
engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in
scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.

<h3>On the different Floquet Hamiltonians in a periodic-driven  Bose-Josephson junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16851</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoshui Lin, Zeyu Rao, Ming Gong</i>
<p>The bosonic Josephson junction, one of the maximally simple models for
periodic-driven many-body systems, has been intensively studied in the past two
decades. Here, we revisit this problem with five different methods, all of
which have solid theoretical reasoning. We find that to the order of
$\omega^{-2}$ ($\omega$ is the modulating frequency), these approaches will
yield slightly different Floquet Hamiltonians. In particular, the parameters in
the Floquet Hamiltonians may be unchanged, increased, or decreased, depending
on the approximations used. Especially, some of the methods generate new
interactions, which still preserve the total number of particles; and the
others do not. The validity of these five effective models is verified using
dynamics of population imbalance and self-trapping phase transition. In all
results, we find the method by first performing a unitary rotation to the
Hamiltonian will have the highest accuracy. The difference between them will
become significate when the modulating frequency is comparable with the driving
amplitude. The results presented in this work indicate that the analysis of the
Floquet Hamiltonian has some kind of subjectivity, which will become an
important issue in future experiments with the increasing of precision. We
demonstrate this physics using a Bose-Josephson junction, and it is to be hoped
that the validity of these methods and their tiny differences put forward in
this work can be verified in realistic experiments in future using quantum
simulating platforms, including but not limited to ultracold atoms.

<h3>A novel two-dimensional all-carbon Dirac node-line semimetal</h3>

<br>
<i>Youjie Wang, Qian Gao, Zhenpeng Hu</i>
<p>Carbon allotropes have vast potential in various applications, including
superconductivity, energy storage, catalysis, and photoelectric semiconductor
devices. Recently, there has been significant research interest in exploring
new carbon materials that exhibit unique electronic structures. Here, we
propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope called TCH-SSH-2D, which
possesses a Dirac node-line (DNL) semimetallic state. The structure of
TCH-SSH-2D is derived from the TCH-type Archimedean polyhedral carbon cluster
units, combined with the SSH lattice model, possessing a space group of
tetragonal P4/mmm. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the
system is dynamically, thermodynamically, and mechanically stable. It exhibits
an energetically favorable structure with no imaginary frequency in the phonon
dispersion curves and elastic constants satisfying the Born-Huang stability
criterion. Our findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the
carbon allotrope family but also provide an opportunity to explore unique Dirac
states in two-dimensional pure carbon systems.

<h3>Anomalous exchange bias effect in ferromagnetic VI3 flakes</h3>

<br>
<i>Xi Zhang, Xiuquan Xia, Qiye Liu, Yonggang He, Le Wang, Junhao Lin, Jia-Wei Mei, Yingchun Cheng, Jun-Feng Dai</i>
<p>The exchange bias (EB) effect, pivotal in magnetic data storage and sensing
devices, has been observed not only in interfacial regions but also in
intrinsic ferromagnetic materials. Here, we've uncovered a robust and stable
exchange bias effect within the layered van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet VI3
employing magnetic circular dichroism microscopy. At 10 K, we observed a
significant exchange field of approximately 0.1 T, accompanied by random shifts
(positive or negative relative to zero magnetic field) after zero-field
cooling. Notably, this effect is effectively controllable after field cooling,
with shift direction opposing the applied magnetic field. The presence of
strong magnetic anisotropic energy within VI3 results in larger
coercivity-bound magnetic domains. These domains dictate the neighboring
ferromagnetic alignment and induce shifts in the hysteresis loop. Our study not
only contributes to comprehending fundamental nanoscale magnetic interactions
but also sheds light on emergent phenomena within layered van der Waals
magnets.

<h3>Acoustic emission data based modelling of fracture of glassy polymer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16910</a>
<br>
<i>Subrat Senapati, Anuradha Banerjee, R. Rajesh</i>
<p>Acoustic emission (AE) activity data resulting from the fracture processes of
brittle materials is valuable real time information regarding the evolving
state of damage in the material. Here, through a combined experimental and
computational study we explore the possibility of utilising the statistical
signatures of AE activity data for characterisation of disorder parameter in
simulation of tensile fracture of epoxy based polymer. For simulations we use a
square random spring network model with quasi-brittle spring behaviour and a
normally distributed failure strain threshold. We show that the disorder
characteristics while have marginal effect on the power law exponent of the
avalanche size distribution, are strongly correlated with the waiting time
interval between consecutive record breaking avalanches as well as the total
number of records. This sensitivity to disorder is exploited in estimating the
disorder parameter suitable for the experiments on tensile failure of epoxy
based polymer. The disorder parameter is estimated assuming equivalence between
the amplitude distribution of AE data and avalanche size distribution of the
simulations. The chosen disorder parameter is shown to well reproduce the
failure characteristics in terms of the peak load of the macroscopic response,
the power-law behaviour with avalanche dominated fracture type as well as
realistic fracture paths.

<h3>Detecting bulk carbon ferromagnetism in graphene multi-edge structure</h3>

<br>
<i>Chao Wang, Nan Jian, Meijie Yin, Xi Zhang, Zhi Yang, Xiuhao Mo, Takashi Kikkawa, Shunsuke Daimon, Eiji Saitoh, Qian Li, Wensheng Yan, Dazhi Hou, Lei Yang, Dongfeng Diao</i>
<p>The emergence of bulk carbon ferromagnetism is long-expected over years. At
nanoscale, carbon ferromagnetism was detected by analyzing the magnetic edge
states via scanning tunneling microscopy(STM), and its origin can be explained
by local redistribution of electron wave function. In larger scale, carbon
ferromagnetism can be created by deliberately producing defects in graphite,
and detected by macroscopic technical magnetization. Meanwhile, it becomes
crucial to determine that the detected magnetization is originated from carbon
rather than from magnetic impurities. One solution is X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD). Nonetheless, a reproducible, full section of XMCD spectrum
across C-1s absorption energy has not appeared yet, which should be decisive
for assuring the indisputable existence of bulk carbon ferromagnetism. Besides,
the lack of direct observation on the atomic structure of the ferromagnetic
carbon leaves the structural origin of its ferromagnetism still in mist. In
this work, for detecting bulk carbon ferromagnetism, we managed to grow
all-carbon film consisting of vertically aligned graphene multi-edge (VGME),
which wove into a three-dimensional hyperfine-porous network. Magnetization
(M-H) curves and XMCD spectra co-confirmed bulk carbon ferromagnetism of VGME
at room temperature, with the average unit magnetic momentum of ~0.0006
miuB/atom. The influence of magnetic impurities on magnetization was excluded
by both absorption spectra and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
measurements. The spin transfer behavior also verified the long-range and
robust feature of the bulk carbon ferromagnetism. Our work provides direct
evidence of elementary resolved bulk carbon ferromagnetism at room temperature
and clarifies its origin from pi-electrons at graphene edges.

<h3>Solitons in binary compounds with stacked two-dimensional honeycomb  lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>James H. Muten, Louise H. Frankland, Edward McCann</i>
<p>We model the electronic properties of thin films of binary compounds with
stacked layers where each layer is a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with two
atoms per unit cell. The two atoms per cell are assigned different onsite
energies in order to consider six different stacking orders: ABC, ABA, AA,
ABC$^{\prime}$, ABA$^{\prime}$, and AA$^{\prime}$. Using a minimal
tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping, we consider whether a fault
in the texture of onsite energies in the vertical, stacking direction supports
localized states, and we find localized states within the bulk band gap for
ABC, ABA, and AA$^{\prime}$ stacking. Depending on the stacking type, parameter
values, and whether the soliton is atomically sharp or a smooth texture, there
are a range of different band structures including soliton bands that are
either isolated or that hybridize with other states, such as surface states,
and soliton bands that are either dispersive or flat, the latter yielding
narrow features in the density of states. We discuss the relevance of our
results to specific materials including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and
other binary compounds.

<h3>Driven particle in a one dimensional periodic potential with feedback  control: efficiency and power optimization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16962" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16962</a>
<br>
<i>Kiran V, Toby Joseph</i>
<p>A Brownian particle moving in a staircase-like potential with feedback
control offers a way to implement Maxwell's demon. An experimental
demonstration of such a system using sinusoidal periodic potential carried out
by Toyabe et al. has shown that information about the particle's position can
be converted to useful work. In this paper, we carry out a numerical study of a
similar system using Brownian dynamics simulation. A Brownian particle moving
in a periodic potential under the action of a constant driving force is made to
move against the drive by measuring the position of the particle and effecting
feedback control by altering potential. The work is extracted during the
potential change and from the movement of the particle against the external
drive. These work extractions come at the cost of information gathered during
the measurement. Efficiency and work extracted per cycle of this information
engine are optimized by varying control parameters as well as feedback
protocols. Both these quantities are found to crucially depend on the amplitude
of the periodic potential as well as the width of the region over which the
particle is searched for during the measurement phase. For the case when
potential flip ($i.e.$, changing the phase of the potential by $180$ degrees)
is used as the feedback mechanism, we argue that the square potential offers a
more efficient information-to-work conversion. The control over the numerical
parameters and averaging over large number of trial runs allow one to study the
non-equilibrium work relations with feedback for this process with precision.
It is seen that the generalized integral fluctuation theorem for error free
measurements holds to within the accuracy of the simulation.

<h3>Searching for the thinnest metallic wire</h3>

<i>Chiara Cignarella, Davide Campi, Nicola Marzari</i>
<p>One-dimensional materials have gained much attention in the last decades:
from carbon nanotubes to ultrathin nanowires, to few-atom atomic chains, these
can all display unique electronic properties and great potential for
next-generation applications. Exfoliable bulk materials could naturally provide
a source for one-dimensional wires with well defined structure and electronics.
Here, we explore a database of one-dimensional materials that could be
exfoliated from experimentally known three-dimensional Van-der-Waals compounds,
searching metallic wires that are resilient to Peierls distortions and could
act as vias or interconnects for future downscaled electronic devices. As the
one-dimensional nature makes these wires particularly susceptible to dynamical
instabilities, we carefully characterise vibrational properties to identify
stable phases and characterize electronic and dynamical properties. Our search
identifies several novel and stable wires; notably, we identify what could be
the thinnest possible exfoliable metallic wire, CuC$_2$, coming a step closer
to the ultimate limit in materials downscaling.

<br>
<i>Zifan Wang, Shuvrangsu Das, Akshay Joshi, Angkur Jyoti Dipanka Shaikeea, Vikram Sudhir Deshpande</i>
<p>The mechanical response of rubbers has been ubiquitously assumed to be only a
function of the imposed strain. Using innovative X-ray measurements capturing
the three-dimensional spatial volumetric strain fields, we demonstrate that
rubbers and indeed many common engineering polymers, undergo significant local
volume changes. But remarkably the overall specimen volume remains constant
regardless of the imposed loading. This strange behaviour which also leads to
apparent negative local bulk moduli is due to the presence of a mobile phase
within these materials. Combining X-ray tomographic observations with
high-speed radiography to track the motion of the mobile phase we have revised
classical thermodynamic frameworks of rubber elasticity. The work opens new
avenues to understand not only the mechanical behaviour of rubbers but a large
class of widely used engineering polymers.

<br>
<i>Peter Rosenberg, Efstratios Manousakis</i>
<p>Beginning from the conventional square-lattice nearest-neighbor
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we allow the $J_x$ and $J_y$ couplings to
be anisotropic, with their values depending on the bond orientation. The
emergence of anisotropic, bond-dependent, couplings should be expected to occur
naturally in most antiferromagnetic compounds which undergo structural
transitions that reduce the point-group symmetry at lower temperature. Using
the spin-wave approximation, we study the model in several parameter regimes by
diagonalizing the reduced Hamiltonian exactly, and computing the edge spectrum
and Berry connection vector, which show clear evidence of localized topological
charges. We discover phases that exhibit Weyl-type spin-wave dispersion,
characterized by pairs of degenerate points and edge states, as well as phases
supporting lines of degeneracy. We also identify a parameter regime in which
there is an exotic state hosting gapless linear spin-wave dispersions with
different longitudinal and transverse spin-wave velocities.

<p>We analyze the surface tension in ultra-cold atomic gases in quasi one
dimensional and one dimensional geometry. In recent years, experimental
observations have confirmed the ``clustering of atoms" to form droplets in
ultra-cold atomic gases and the emergence of this new phase is attributed to
the beyond mean-field interaction. However, two decades earlier, liquid
formation was predicted due to the competition of two-body and three-body
interactions. Here, we review both the propositions and comment on the role of
beyond mean-field and three-body interaction in liquid formation by calculating
the surface tension.

<h3>Superconductivity in nickelate and cuprate superconductors with strong  bilayer coupling</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhen Fan, Jian-Feng Zhang, Bo Zhan, Dingshun Lv, Xing-Yu Jiang, Bruce Normand, Tao Xiang</i>
<p>The discovery of superconductivity at 80 K under high pressure in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ presents the groundbreaking confirmation that high-$T_c$
superconductivity is a property of strongly correlated materials beyond
cuprates. We use density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the band
structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure to verify that the low-energy
bands are composed almost exclusively of Ni 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O 2$p$ orbitals.
We deduce that the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals are essentially decoupled by the
geometry of the high-pressure structure and by the effect of the Ni Hund
coupling being strongly suppressed, which results from the enhanced interlayer
antiferromagnetic interaction between $d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the strong
intralayer hybridization of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals with O 2$p$. By
introducing a tight-binding model for the Fermi surfaces and low-energy
dispersions, we arrive at a bilayer $t$-$t_\perp$-$J$ model with strong
interlayer hopping, which we show is a framework unifying La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
with cuprate materials possessing similar band structures, particularly the
compounds La$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_6$, Pb$_2$Sr$_2$YCu$_3$O$_8$, and
EuSr$_2$Cu$_2$NbO$_8$. We use a renormalized mean-field theory to show that
these systems should have ($d$+$is$)-wave superconductivity, with a dominant
$d$-wave component and the high $T_c$ driven by the near-optimally doped
$\beta$ band, while the $\alpha$ band adds an $s$-wave component that should
lead to clear experimental signatures.

<i>M. A. Kassem, T. Shiotani, H. Ohta, Y. Tabata, T. Waki, H. Nakamura</i>
<p>ScFe$_6$Ge$_4$ with the LiFe$_6$Ge$_4$-type structure (space group
$R{\bar{3}}m$), which has a double-layered kagome lattice (18$h$ site) of Fe
crystallographically equivalent to that of a well-known topological ferromagnet
Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, is newly found to be antiferromagnetic (AFM) with a high N\'eel
temperature of $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 650$ K, in contrast to the ferromagnetic
(FM) ground state previously proposed in a literature. $^{45}$Sc nuclear
magnetic resonance experiment revealed the absence of a hyperfine field at the
Sc site, providing microscopic evidence for the AFM state and indicating AFM
coupling between the bilayer kagome blocks. The stability of the AFM structure
under the assumption of FM intra-bilayer coupling is verified by DFT
calculations.

<p>We consider a new class of topological defects in chiral magnetic crystals
such as FeGe and MnSi. These are composite topological defects that arise when
skyrmions in the magnetic order intersect with twin boundaries in the
underlying crystalline lattice. We show that the resulting stable
configurations are a new type of defect that can be viewed as half-hopfions.

<h3>Phase diagram of the Kitaev-Hubbard model: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin and  QMC approaches</h3>

<i>Fatemeh Mohammadi, Mojtaba Tabatabaei, Mehdi Kargarian, Abolhassan Vaezi</i>
<p>Recent experiments show that the ground state of some of the layered
materials with localized moments is in close proximity to the Kitaev spin
liquid, calling for a proper model to describe the measurements. The
Kitaev-Hubbard model (KHM) is the minimal model that captures the essential
ingredients of these systems, namely it yields the Kitaev-Heisenberg spin model
at the strong couling limit and contains the charge fluctuations present in
these materials as well. Despite its relevance, the phase diagram of the KHM
has not been rigorously revealed yet. In this work, we study the full phase
diagram of the KHM using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin mean-field theory as
well as the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) on rather large systems
and at low temperatures. The Mott transition is signaled by a vanishing
quasiparticle weight evaluated using the slave-spin construction. Moreover, we
show using both QMC and slave spin approaches that there are multiple magnetic
phase transitions within the Mott phase including magnetically ordered phases
and most notably a spin liquid phase consistent with recent studies of the KHM.

<h3>Rheological softening of metal nanocontacts sheared under oscillatory  strains</h3>

<p>The way metal interfaces evolve during frictional sliding, and how that
evolution can be externally influenced under external drivers are important
questions, hard to investigate experimentally because the contacts themselves
are generally difficult to access. Here we focus on an elementary constituent
of a general metal-metal interface, namely an ultra-thin individual
nanocontact, where recent rheological studies of crystalline gold nanocontacts
[Nature 569, 393 (2019)] showed a dramatic and unexpected mechanical softening
as a result of external oscillatory tensile stress. The question which we
address through realistic nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations is to
what extent such mechanical softening might influence the shearing habit of
gold nanocontacts at room temperature. It is found that the shearing evolution,
which occurs through a series of discrete slips, is indeed rheologically
softened, even though not completely, by the oscillations. Differences also
emerge for different types of external oscillation, tensile or rotational. The
relevance of these results for future experiments will be discussed.

<h3>Coexistence of Dirac fermion and charge density wave in square-net-based  semimetal LaAuSb2</h3>

<i>Xueliang Wu, Zhixiang Hu, David Graf, Yu Liu, Chaoyue Deng, Huixia Fu, Asish K. Kundu, Tonica Valla, Cedomir Petrovic, Aifeng Wang</i>
<p>We report a comprehensive study of magnetotransport properties,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations on self-flux grown LaAuSb$_2$ single crystals.
Resistivity and Hall measurements reveal a charge density wave (CDW) transition
at 77 K. MR and de Haas-Van Alphen (dHvA) measurements indicate that the
transport properties of LaAuSb$_2$ are dominated by Dirac fermions that arise
from Sb square nets. ARPES measurements and DFT calculations reveal an
electronic structure with a common feature of the square-net-based topological
semimetals, which is in good agreement with the magnetotransport properties.
Our results indicate the coexistence of CDW and Dirac fermion in LaAuSb$_2$,
both of which are linked to the bands arising from the Sb-square net,
suggesting that the square net could serve as a structural motif to explore
various electronic orders.

<h3>Signatures of quantum phases in a dissipative system</h3>

<p>Lindbladian formalism, as tuned to dissipative and open systems, has been
all-pervasive to interpret non-equilibrium steady states of quantum many-body
systems. We study the fate of free fermionic and superconducting phases in a
dissipative one-dimensional Kitaev model - where the bath acts both as a source
and a sink of fermionic particles with different coupling rates. As a function
of these two couplings, we investigate the steady state, its entanglement
content, and its approach from varying initial states. Interestingly, we find
that the steady state phase diagram retains decipherable signatures of ground
state critical physics. We also show that early-time fidelity is a useful
marker to find a subclass of phase transitions in such situations. Moreover, we
show that the survival of critical signatures at late-times, strongly depend on
the thermal nature of the steady state. This connection hints at a
correspondence between quantum observables and classical magnetism in the
steady state of such systems. Our work uncovers interesting connections between
dissipative quantum many-body systems, thermalization of a classical spin and
many-body quantum critical phenomena.

<h3>SymTFT out of equilibrium: from time crystals to braided drives and  Floquet codes</h3>

<br>
<i>Vedant Motamarri, Campbell McLauchlan, Benjamin Béri</i>
<p>Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is a framework to capture
universal features of quantum many-body systems by viewing them as a boundary
of topological order in one higher dimension. This yielded numerous insights in
static low-energy settings. Here we study what SymTFT can tell about
nonequilibrium, focusing on one-dimensional (1D) driven systems and their 2D
SymTFT. In driven settings, boundary conditions (BCs) can be dynamical and can
apply both spatially and temporally. We show how this enters SymTFT via
topological operators, which we then use to uncover several new results for 1D
dynamics. These include revealing time crystals (TCs) as systems with
symmetry-twisted temporal BCs, finding robust bulk TC features in phases
thought to be only boundary TCs, Floquet dualities, or identifying Floquet
codes as space-time duals to systems with duality-twisted spatial BCs. We also
show how, by making duality-twisted BCs dynamical, non-Abelian braiding of
duality defects can enter SymTFT, leading to effects such as the exact pumping
of symmetry charges between a system and its BCs. We illustrate our ideas for
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 1D systems, but our construction applies for any
finite Abelian symmetry.

<h3>Layer-number and strain effects on the structural and electronic  properties of PtSe2 material</h3>

<i>Rania Amairi, Smiri Adlen, Sihem Jaziri</i>
<p>Bandgap engineering of low-dimensional materials forms a robust basis for
advancements in optoelectronic technologies. Platinum diselenide (PtSe2)
material has shown various electronic features when going from bulk to
monolayer (ML). In this work, density functional theory (DFT) plus van der
Waals (vdW) corrections have been considered to study the structural and
electronic properties of different PtSe2 systems, namely ML, bilayer (BL),
trilayer (TL), fourlayer (FL) and bulk. In particular, various vdW corrections
have been tested to describe the inter-layer interaction of PtSe2 material.
According to the comparison with the available experimental data, the vdW
corrections vdW-DF and rVV10 gave the most accurate results. In fact, our
findings show that while vdW corrections have no significant effect on the
electronic structure of bulk PtSe2, they alter that of the PtSe2 BL, TL and FL
materials. Furthermore, our calculation revealed that by decreasing the number
of layers, the interlayer distance increases. In fact, a correlation between
the interlayer distance and the bandgap feature was obtained. Indeed, the
bandgap of PtSe2 material increases with the increase of this distance, due to
the energy shift of the Se-pz dominated conduction and valence bands. Moreover,
the control of the interlayer distance via vertical compressive strain led to
the bandgap tuning of semiconductor PtSe2 BL. Indeed, a semi-metal character of
PtSe2 BL can be obtained under 17% vertical strain. Our work shows a deep
understanding of the correlation between the structural and electronic
properties, and thus a possibility to tune the bandgap by strain means.

<h3>Tunable even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in  trilayer graphene</h3>

<p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are exotic quantum many-body phases
whose elementary charged excitations are neither bosons nor fermions but
anyons, obeying fractional braiding statistics. While most FQH states are
believed to have Abelian anyons, the Moore-Read type states with even
denominators, appearing at half filling of a Landau level (LL), are predicted
to possess non-Abelian excitations with appealing potentials in topological
quantum computation. These states, however, depend sensitively on the orbital
contents of the single-particle LL wavefunction and the mixing between
different LLs. Although they have been observed in a few materials, their
non-Abelian statistics still awaits experimental confirmation. Here we show
magnetotransport measurements on Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG), whose
unique multiband structure facilitates the interlaced LL mixing, which can be
controlled by external magnetic and displacement fields. We observe a series of
robust FQH states including even-denominator ones at filling factors
$\nu=-9/2$, $-3/2$, $3/2$ and $9/2$. In addition, we are able to finetune the
LL mixing and crossings to drive quantum phase transitions of these
half-filling states and their neighboring odd-denominator ones, exhibiting a
related emerging and waning behavior. Our results establish TLG as a
controllable system for tuning the weights of LL orbitals and mixing strength,
and a fresh platform to seek for non-Abelian quasi-particles.

<h3>Microscopic Mechanism of Pair-Density-Wave Superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17208" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17208</a>
<br>
<i>Dmitry Miserev, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss</i>
<p>We present an analytic theory unraveling the microscopic mechanism of
high-temperature superconductivity posing a longstanding challenge in condensed
matter physics. Our model consists of a $D$-dimensional electron gas with
electron and hole Fermi surfaces, subject to a repulsive electron-electron
interaction of a finite range exceeding the average inter-particle distance.
Evaluating susceptibilities in a systematic perturbative approach and via
one-loop renormalization group theory, we identify an intrinsic Fermi liquid
instability towards the formation of superconducting pair-density-wave order
when the interaction coupling strength reaches a universal critical value.
Similar singularities in charge and spin susceptibilities at the critical
coupling indicate the competition between charge, spin, and pair density wave
orders, aligning with the phenomenological understanding of the phase diagram
of high-temperature superconductors.

<h3>Possible Unconventional Surface Superconductivity in the Half-Heusler  YPtBi</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17213</a>
<br>
<i>Eylon Persky, Alan Fang, Xinyang Zhang, Carolina Adamo, Eli Levenson-Falk, Chandra Shekhar, Claudia Felser, Binghai Yan, Aharon Kapitulnik</i>
<p>We report an extensive extensive study of the noncentrosymmetric half-Heusler
topological superconductor YPtBi, revealing unusual relation between bulk
superconductivity and the appearance of surface superconductivity at
temperatures up to 3 times the bulk transition temperature. Transport
measurements confirmed the low carrier density of the material and its bulk
superconducting transition, which was also observed in ac susceptibility
through mutual inductance (MI) measurements. However, a weak signature of
superconductivity in the MI measurements appeared much above the bulk
transition temperature, which was further observed in scanning tunneling
spectroscopy. Polar Kerr effect measurements suggest that while the bulk
superconductor may exhibit an unusual nodal superconducting state, only the
surface state breaks time reversal symmetry. Complementary tunneling
measurements on LuPtBi are used to establish the observations on YPtBi, while
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations may shed light on the origin of
this unusual surface state.
