<h3>Capillary-lubrication force exerted on a 2D particle moving towards a  fluid interface</h3>

A rigid object moving in a viscous fluid and in close proximity with an
elastic wall experiences self-generated elastohydrodynamic interactions. This
has been the subject of an intense research activity, with a recent and growing
attention given to the particular case of elastomeric and gel-like substrates.
Here, we address the situation where the elastic wall is replaced by a
capillary surface. Specifically, we analyze the lubrication flow generated by
the prescribed normal motion of a rigid infinite cylinder near the deformable
interface separating two immiscible and incompressible viscous fluids. Using a
combination of analytical and numerical treatments, we compute the emergent
capillary-lubrication force at leading order in compliance, and characterize
its dependencies with the interfacial tension, viscosities of the fluids, and
length scales of the problem. Interestingly, we identify two main
contributions: i) a velocity-dependent adhesion-like force ; ii) an
acceleration-dependant inertial-like force. Our results may have implications
for the mobility of colloids near complex interfaces and for the motility of
confined microbiological entities.

Edge states occurring in Chern and quantum spin-Hall phases are signatures of
the topological electronic band structure in two-dimensional (2D) materials.
Recently, a new topological electromagnetic phase of graphene characterized by
the optical N-invariant has been proposed. Optical N-invariant arises from
repulsive Hall viscosity in hydrodynamic many-body electron systems,
fundamentally different from the Chern and Z2 invariants. In this paper, we
introduce the topologically protected edge excitation -- optical N-plasmon of
interacting many-body electron systems in the topological optical N-phase.
These optical N-plasmons are signatures of the topological plasmonic band
structure in 2D materials. We demonstrate that optical N-plasmons exhibit
fundamentally different dispersion relations, stability, and edge profiles from
the topologically trivial edge magneto plasmons. Based on the optical
N-plasmon, we design an ultra sub-wavelength broadband topological hydrodynamic
circulator, which is a chiral quantum radio-frequency circuit component crucial
for information routing and interfacing quantum-classical computing systems.
Furthermore, we reveal that optical N-plasmons can be effectively tuned by the
neighboring dielectric environment without breaking the topological properties.
Our work provides a smoking gun signature of repulsive Hall viscosity and opens
practical applications of topological electromagnetic phases of two-dimensional
materials.

We study impurities in integrable models from the viewpoint of generalized
hydrodynamics (GHD). An impurity can be thought of as a boundary condition for
the GHD equation, relating the state on the left and right side. We find that
in interacting models it is not possible to disentangle incoming and outgoing
states, which means that it is not possible to think of scattering as a mapping
which maps the incoming state to the outgoing state. We then introduce a novel
class of impurities, dubbed mesoscopic impurities, whose spatial size is
mesoscopic (i.e. their size $L_{\mathrm{micro}} \ll L_{\mathrm{imp}} \ll L$ is
much larger than the microscopic length scale $L_{\mathrm{micro}}$, but much
smaller than the system size $L$). Due to their large size it is possible to
describe mesoscopic impurities via GHD. This simplification allows one to study
these impurities both analytically and numerically. These impurities show
interesting non-perturbative scattering behavior, for instance non-uniqueness
of solutions and a non-analytic dependence on the impurity strength. In models
with one quasi-particle species and a scattering phase shift that depends on
the difference of momenta only, we find that one can describe the scattering
using an effective Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian is dressed due to the
interaction between particles and satisfies a self consistency fixed point
equation. On the example of the hard rods model we demonstrate how this fixed
point equation can be used to find explicit solutions to the scattering
problem.

<h3>Chimera resonance in networks of chaotic maps</h3>

<i>Elena Rybalova, Vasilii Nechaev, Eckehard Schöll, Galina Strelkova</i>

<br>
We explore numerically the impact of additive Gaussian noise on the
spatio-temporal dynamics of ring networks of nonlocally coupled chaotic maps.
The local dynamics of network nodes is described by the logistic map, the
Ricker map, and the Henon map. 2D distributions of the probability of observing
chimera states are constructed in terms of the coupling strength and the noise
intensity and for several chosen values of the local dynamics parameters. It is
shown that the coupling strength range can be the widest at a certain optimum
noise level at which chimera states are observed with a high probability for a
large number of different realizations of randomly distributed initial
conditions and noise sources. This phenomenon demonstrates a constructive role
of noise in analogy with the effects of stochastic and coherence resonance and
can be referred to as chimera resonance.

<h3>Photonic Stochastic Emergent Storage: Exploiting Scattering-intrinsic  Patterns for Programmable Deep Classification</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00007</a>

Disorder is a pervasive characteristic of natural systems, offering a wealth
of non-repeating patterns. In this study, we present a novel storage method
that harnesses naturally-occurring random structures to store an arbitrary
pattern in a memory device. This method, the stochastic emergent storage (SES),
builds upon the concept of emergent archetypes, where a training set of
imperfect examples (prototypes) is employed to instantiate an archetype in an
Hopfield-like network through emergent processes.
We demostrate this non-Hebbian paradigm in the photonic domain by utilizing
random transmission matrices, which govern light scattering in a white-paint
turbid medium, as prototypes. Through the implementation of programmable
hardware, we successfully realize and experimentally validate the capability to
store an arbitrary archetype and perform classification at the speed of light.
Leveraging the vast number of modes excited by mesoscopic diffusion, our
approach enables the simultaneous storage of thousands of memories without
requiring any additional fabrication efforts. Similar to a content addressable
memory, all stored memories can be collectively assessed against a given
pattern to identify the matching element. Furthermore, by organizing memories
spatially into distinct classes, they become features within a higher-level
categorical (deeper) optical classification layer.

This feature article considers the analysis of the initial states of film
growth on polymer substrates. The assembled results are based on the
cooperation between research groups in the field of plasma physics, chemistry,
electric as well as mechanical engineering over the last years, mostly within
the frame of the transregional project SFB-TR 87 ("Pulsed high power plasmas
for the synthesis of nanostructured functional layers"). This feature article
aims at bridging the gap between the understanding of plasma processes in the
gas phase and the resulting surface and interface processes of the polymer. The
results show that interfacial adhesion and initial film growth can be well
controlled and even predicted based on the combination of analytical
approaches.

Stochastic correlated observables with lognormal distribution are ubiquitous
in nature, and hence they deserve an exact information-theoretic
characterization. We derive a general analytical formula for mutual information
between vectors of lognormally distributed random variables, and provide lower
and upper bounds on its value. That formula and its bounds involve determinants
and traces of high dimensional covariance matrices of these variables. Exact
explicit forms of mutual information are calculated for some special cases and
types of correlations. As an example, we provide an analytic formula for mutual
information between neurons, relevant for neural networks in the brain.

<br>
<br>
Lattice defects and interfacial absorbates represent two extrinsic but
ubiquitous factors that exert profound impacts on the luminescent properties of
semiconductors. However, their impacts are normally tangled and remain to be
separately elucidated. Here, we clarify the individual roles of each factor by
tracking the weight evolution of photonic quasiparticles by modulating the
densities of sulfur vacancies in monolayer MoS$_2$ via ad hoc defect
engineering. In particular, we perform atomistic analyses on the densities of
sulfur vacancies by employing atomically resolved scanning transmission
electron microscopy to quantitatively characterize the generation rates of
sulfur vacancies in MoS$_2$ on two types of substrates with opposite surface
hydrophobicity natures. We reveal that the generation rate of sulfur vacancies
can even double on the hydrophilic substrates. More importantly, the impact of
sulfur vacancies over the weight of trionic emission is closely associated with
the substrate hydrophobicity, which is manifested noticeably in the hydrophobic
substrates, but insignificant in the hydrophilic ones. The results represent an
in-depth understanding on the roles of the extrinsic factors on the luminescent
properties in atomically thin semiconductors.

CDs and DVDs are forensically important substrates for latent fingermarks.
Upright columnar thin films (CTFs) grown conformally over these substrates were
shown to significantly enhance the visual quality of fingermarks. Enhancement
to maximum possible grade for visual quality occurred, even for the samples
that were developed three days after the fingermarks were placed on them. The
CTFs were deposited by directing a collimated vapor flux of an evaporant
material towards the substrate placed at an angle and made to rotate rapidly.

<h3>Nonlinear Topological Mechanics in Elliptically Geared Isostatic  Metamaterials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite the extensive studies of topological systems, the experimental
characterizations of strongly nonlinear topological phases have been lagging.
To address this shortcoming, we design and build elliptically geared isostatic
metamaterials. Their nonlinear topological transitions can be realized by
collective soliton motions, which stem from the transition of nonlinear Berry
phase. Endowed by the intrinsic nonlinear topological mechanics, surface polar
elasticity and dislocation-bound zero modes can be created or annihilated as
the topological polarization reverses orientation. Our approach integrates
topological physics with strongly nonlinear mechanics and promises multi-phase
structures at the micro and macro scales.

<h3>Scaling of entanglement entropy at quantum critical points in random  spin chains</h3>

<br>

We study the properties of entanglement entropy (EE) as a scaling variable
near quantum critical points in interacting random spin chains. Using DMRG, we
compute the half-chain EE in two models exhibiting a quantum phase transition
(QPT) from a gapped phase to a random singlet phase (RSP). For the AKLT model
where the critical point exists at a finite disorder strength. EE is found to
diverge logarithmically in system size with an effective central charge $c_{\rm
eff} = 1.165(37)$ at the QPT. In contrast, for the Majumdar-Ghosh model, where
a valence bond solid phase is unstable towards RSP at arbitrarily small
disorder, we obtain the correlation length exponent $\nu = 1.162(47)$. Our
results for the disordered AKLT model are close to the values predicted in
previous studies. However, the critical exponent for Majumdar-Ghosh model
differs significantly from a prior theoretical prediction.

<h3>Relaxation Dynamics of a Liquid in the Vicinity of an Attractive  Surface: The Process of Escaping from the Surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00086" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00086</a>
<br>
<i>Alireza F. Behbahani, Vagelis Harmandaris</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the displacements of the particles of a liquid perpendicular to an
attractive confining surface, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations.
Because of the attraction of the surface, the particles are trapped in its
vicinity. This leads to a three-step relaxation of the liquid close to the
surface. The first step is related to the rattling motions of the particles in
the cages formed by their nearest neighbors; the second step is related to
small-scale movements close to the surface, and the third step is associated
with the process of escaping from the surface. The three-step relaxation is
seen through the self-intermediate scattering function or the mean squared
displacement of the particles. Upon reducing temperature, the second and third
relaxation steps seem to be gradually merged. The solid surface induces also a
strong heterogeneity in the mobility of its adjacent particles. This can be
seen from the large peak of the non-Gaussian parameter for the particle
displacements, which concurs with the appearance of the third step in the
relaxation functions. The surface-induced dynamical heterogeneity increases
with decreasing temperature.

<h3>Heterogeneous field response of hierarchical polar laminates in relaxor  ferroelectrics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Relaxor ferroelectrics are a class of materials that are widely perceived as
deriving their exotic properties from structural heterogeneities. Understanding
the microscopic origin of the superior electromechanical response requires
knowledge not only concerning the formation of polar nanodomains (PNDs) built
from individual atoms but more importantly the spatial distribution of PNDs
over longer distances. The mesoscale PND arrangement is shaped by the
interactions between these domains and, in turn, dictates the electric-field
driven PND response directly relevant to the macroscopic material properties.
Here, we show the emergence of mesoscale lattice order that we name "polar
laminates" in the canonical relaxor ferroelectric
0.68PbMg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_{3}$-0.32PbTiO$_{3}$ (PMN-0.32PT) using X-ray
coherent nano-diffraction. These laminates are nematic with a size of ~350 nm
and arise from the staggered arrangement of ~13 nm monoclinic PNDs along the
<110> of the pseudocubic lattice. The spatial distribution of c-axis strain is
directly correlated with the tilting of the PNDs and is most prominent between
the laminates. Further operando nano-diffraction studies demonstrate
heterogeneous electric-field-driven responses. The most active regions tend to
reside inside the laminates while the spatial pinning centers are between the
laminates. This observation reveals the hierarchical assembly of lattice order
as a novel form of electron and lattice self-organization in heterogenous
materials and establishes the role of such mesoscale spatial arrangement in
connecting the nanoscale heterogeneity and macroscopic material properties.
These findings provide a guiding principle for the design and optimization of
future relaxors and may shed light on the existence of similar behavior in a
wide range of quantum and functional materials.

<br>
<br>
The search for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly cooling
technologies is a key driver for the development of magnetic refrigeration
based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). This phenomenon arises from the
interplay between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom that is strong in
certain materials, leading to a change in temperature upon application or
removal of a magnetic field. Here we report on a new material,
Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$NiSi$_{0.95}$Al$_{0.05}$, with an exceptionally large
isothermal entropy at room temperature. By combining experimental and
theoretical methods we outline the microscopic mechanism behind the large MCE
in this material. It is demonstrated that the competition between the
Ni$_2$In-type hexagonal phase and the MnNiSi-type orthorhombic phase, that
coexist in this system, combined with the distinctly different magnetic
properties of these phases, is a key parameter for the functionality of this
material for magnetic cooling.

<h3>Substrate suppression of oxidation process in pnictogen monolayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
2D materials present an interesting platform for device designs. However,
oxidation can drastically change the system's properties, which need to be
accounted for. Through {\it ab initio} calculations, we investigated
freestanding and SiC-supported As, Sb, and Bi mono-elemental layers. The
oxidation process occurs through an O$_2$ spin-state transition, accounted for
within the Landau-Zener transition. Additionally, we have investigated the
oxidation barriers and the role of spin-orbit coupling. Our calculations
pointed out that the presence of SiC substrate reduces the oxidation time scale
compared to a freestanding monolayer. We have extracted the energy barrier
transition, compatible with our spin-transition analysis. Besides, spin-orbit
coupling is relevant to the oxidation mechanisms and alters time scales. The
energy barriers decrease as the pnictogen changes from As to Sb to Bi for the
freestanding systems, while for SiC-supported, they increase across the
pnictogen family. Our computed energy barriers confirm the enhanced robustness
against oxidation for the SiC-supported systems.

Oxide heterostructures exhibit a vast variety of unique physical properties.
Examples are unconventional superconductivity in layered nickelates and
topological polar order in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices.
Although it is clear that variations in oxygen content are crucial for the
electronic correlation phenomena in oxides, it remains a major challenge to
quantify their impact. Here, we measure the chemical composition in
multiferroic (LuFeO$_3$)$_9$/(LuFe$_2$O$_4$)$_1$ superlattices, revealing a
one-to-one correlation between the distribution of oxygen vacancies and the
electric and magnetic properties. Using atom probe tomography, we observe
oxygen vacancies arranging in a layered three-dimensional structure with a
local density on the order of 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, congruent with the
formula-unit-thick ferrimagnetic LuFe$_2$O$_4$ layers. The vacancy order is
promoted by the locally reduced formation energy and plays a key role in
stabilizing the ferroelectric domains and ferrimagnetism in the LuFeO$_3$ and
LuFe$_2$O$_4$ layers, respectively. The results demonstrate the importance of
oxygen vacancies for the room-temperature multiferroicity in this system and
establish an approach for quantifying the oxygen defects with atomic-scale
precision in 3D, giving new opportunities for deterministic defect-enabled
property control in oxide heterostructures.

<h3>Mechanical investigations of composite cathode degradation in  all-solid-state-batteries</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite ongoing efforts aimed at increasing energy density in
all-solid-state-batteries, the optimal composite cathode morphology, which
requires minimal volume change, small void development, and good interfacial
contact, remains a significant concern within the community. In this work, we
focus on the theoretical investigation of the above-mentioned mechanical
defects in the composite cathode during electrochemical cycling. It is
demonstrated that these mechanical defects are highly dependent on the SE
material properties, the external stack pressure and the cathode active
material (CAM) loading. The following conclusions are highlighted in this
study: (1) Higher CAM loading (>50 vol. %) causes an increase in mechanical
defects, including large cathode volume change (>5%), contact loss (50%) and
porosity (>1%). (2) High external stack pressure up to 7MPa reduces mechanical
defects while preventing internal fracture in the cathode. (3) Soft SE
materials with small Youngs modulus (<10GPa) and low hardness (<2GPa) can
significantly minimize these mechanical defects during cycling. (4) A design
strategy is proposed for high CAM loading with minimal mechanical defects when
different SE materials are utilized in the composite cathode, including
oxide-type SE, sulfide-type SE, and halide-type SE. The research provides
specific guidelines to optimize the composite cathode in terms of mechanical
properties. These guidelines broaden the design approach towards improving the
performance of SSB, by highlighting the importance of considering the
mechanical properties of battery materials.

<h3>Accretion-Ablation Mechanics</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper we formulate a geometric nonlinear theory of the mechanics of
accreting-ablating bodies. This is a generalization of the theory of accretion
mechanics of Sozio and Yavari (2019). More specifically, we are interested in
large deformation analysis of bodies that undergo a continuous and simultaneous
accretion and ablation on their boundaries while under external loads. In this
formulation the natural configuration of an accreting-ablating body is a
time-dependent Riemannian 3-manifold with a metric that is an unknown a priori
and is determined after solving the accretion-ablation initial-boundary-value
problem. In addition to the time of attachment map, we introduce a time of
detachment map that along with the time of attachment map, and the accretion
and ablation velocities describes the time-dependent reference configuration of
the body. The kinematics, material manifold, material metric, constitutive
equations, and the balance laws are discussed in detail. As a concrete example
and application of the geometric theory, we analyze a thick hollow circular
cylinder made of an arbitrary incompressible isotropic material that is under a
finite time-dependent extension while undergoing continuous ablation on its
inner cylinder boundary and accretion on its outer cylinder boundary. The state
of deformation and stress during the accretion-ablation process, and the
residual stretch and stress after the completion of the accretion-ablation
process are computed.

<h3>A Geometric Field Theory of Dislocation Mechanics</h3>

In this paper a geometric field theory of dislocation dynamics and finite
plasticity in single crystals is formulated. Starting from the multiplicative
decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic parts, we
use Cartan's moving frames to describe the distorted lattice structure via
differential $1$-forms. In this theory the primary fields are the dislocation
fields, defined as a collection of differential $2$-forms. The defect content
of the lattice structure is then determined by the superposition of the
dislocation fields. All these differential forms constitute the internal
variables of the system. The evolution equations for the internal variables are
derived starting from the kinematics of the dislocation 2-forms, which is
expressed using the notions of flow and of Lie derivative. This is then coupled
with the rate of change of the lattice structure through Orowan's equation. The
governing equations are derived using a two-potential approach to a variational
principle of the Lagrange-d'Alembert type. As in the nonlinear setting the
lattice structure evolves in time, the dynamics of dislocations on slip systems
is formulated by enforcing some constraints in the variational principle. Using
the Lagrange multipliers associated with these constraints, one obtains the
forces that the lattice exerts on the dislocation fields in order to keep them
gliding on some given crystallographic planes. Moreover, the geometric
formulation allows one to investigate the integrability -- and hence the
existence -- of glide surfaces, and how the glide motion is affected by it.
Lastly, a linear theory for small dislocation densities is derived, allowing
one to identify the nonlinear effects that do not appear in the linearized
setting.

For a given class of materials, universal displacements are those
displacements that can be maintained for any member of the class by applying
only boundary tractions. In this paper we study universal displacements in
compressible anisotropic linear elastic solids reinforced by a family of
inextensible fibers. For each symmetry class and for a uniform distribution of
straight fibers respecting the corresponding symmetry we characterize the
respective universal displacements. A goal of this paper is to investigate how
an internal constraint affects the set of universal displacements. We have
observed that other than the triclinic and cubic solids in the other five
classes (a fiber-reinforced solid with straight fibers cannot be isotropic) the
presence of inextensible fibers enlarges the set of universal displacements.

A fragile ordered state can be easily tuned by various external parameters.
When the ordered state is suppressed to zero temperature, a quantum phase
transition occurs, which is often marked by the appearance of unconventional
superconductivity. While the quantum critical point can be hidden, the
influence of the quantum criticality extends to fairly high temperatures,
manifesting the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the wide range of the $p$-$H$-$T$
phase spaces. Here, we report the tuning of a magnetic energy scale in the
heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$, previously identified as a peak in the
$c$-axis electrical transport, with applied pressure and magnetic field as
complementary tuning parameters. Upon increasing pressure, the characteristic
$c$-axis peak moves to a lower temperature before vanishing near the critical
pressure of about 15 kbar. The application of a magnetic field broadens the
peak under all studied pressure values. The observed Fermi-liquid behavior at
ambient pressure is violated near the critical pressure, exhibiting nearly
linear resistivity in temperature and an enhanced pre-factor. Our results
provide a clear picture of energy scale evolution relevant to magnetic quantum
criticality in UTe$_2$.

Ensemble density functional theory (EDFT) is a promising alternative to
time-dependent density functional theory for computing electronic excitation
energies. Using coordinate scaling, we prove several fundamental exact
conditions in EDFT and illustrate them on the exact singlet bi-ensemble of the
Hubbard dimer. Several approximations violate these conditions, and some
ground-state conditions from quantum chemistry do not generalize to EDFT. The
strong-correlation limit is derived for the dimer, revealing weight-dependent
derivative discontinuities in EDFT.

<h3>The near room-temperature upsurge of electrical resistivity in Lu-H-N is  not superconductivity, but a metal-to-poor-conductor transition</h3>

Since the discovery of superconductivity in mercury at 4 K in 1911, searching
for materials with superconductivity at higher temperatures towards practical
conditions has been a primary enduring goal. The recent report of
room-temperature superconductivity at near-ambient pressure in nitrogen-doped
lutetium hydride (Lu-H-N) by Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. (Hereafter referred as
D-G) seems a great step approaching the ultimate goal. Specifically, they
claimed evidence of superconductivity on Lu-H-N with a maximum Tc of 294 K at 1
GPa. However, the failure to observe the drastic temperature-dependent
resistance change above 200 K in high-pressure synthesized Lu-H-N compounds, a
prerequisite for superconductivity, by researchers worldwide in all independent
follow-up studies casts a heavy shadow on the authenticity of the claims. The
sober questions are: what is the sample that produces the sharp resistance jump
near room temperature? What are the reasons for the non-reproducibility of
others who follow the D-G method of synthesis and the inscrutable low success
rate (35%) in synthesizing the right sample even for the authors in Ref. 1?
What causes the observed sharp resistance jump? Here, with a well-controlled
experiment protocol, we repeatedly reproduced the near room-temperature sudden
change of electrical resistance in the Lu-H-N sample, and we could
quantitatively compare its behavior with the initial pure Lu in a normal
metallic state. These results enable us to scrutinize the origin for the
near-room temperature sharp resistance change, which is attributed to a
metal-to-poor-conductor transition rather than superconductivity.

<h3>Status of the Spurious Evidence for Photoinduced Superconductivity</h3>

After more than a decade of research on photoinduced superconductivity, the
experimental evidence for its existence remains controversial. Recently, we
identified a fundamental flaw in the analysis of several influential results on
K$_3$C$_{60}$ and showed that similar measurements on other compounds suffer
from the same problem. We described how to account for this systematic error,
and reanalyzed evidence that had previously been advanced for both photoinduced
superconductivity and Higgs-mediated terahertz amplification. We found that
both phenomena may be understood instead as a photoenhancement of the carrier
mobility that saturates with fluence, with no need to appeal to a photoinduced
phase transition to a superconducting state. We summarize this reinterpretation
and describe how subsequent work on K$_3$C$_{60}$ provides quantitative support
for it.

Hexagonal manganese oxides RMnO$_3$ show intriguing topological
ferroelectric-domain walls with variable conductivity, leading to domain wall
engineering. Despite the numerous experimental studies on the polar nanoscale
structures, controlling ferroelectric domains has not been sufficiently
investigated. Here, we reveal the unprecedented coexistence of polar-nonpolar
nanoscale domains that can be formed by substituting Ti ions in HoMnO$_3$.
Unusual polar nanoscale domains are embedded in nonpolar domains with different
crystallographic symmetry. This polar-nonpolar coexisting structure is
naturally assembled by adjusting the lattice length during a solid-state
reaction process. Furthermore, the comprehensive study reveals that the
reversible microstructural change with a nonpolar-polar transition is strongly
correlated with the oxygen storage properties in Ho(Mn, Ti)O$_{3+\delta}$. The
present results provide important insight into the nanoscale polar-nonpolar
domain coexistence in functional rare-earth manganese oxides, RMnO$_3$.

Interfaces in FeCoB/MgO/FeCoB magnetic tunnel junction play a vital role in
controlling their magnetic and transport properties for various applications in
spintronics and magnetic recording media. In this work, interface structures of
a few nm thick FeCoB layers in FeCoB/MgO and MgO/FeCoB bilayers are
comprehensively studied using x-ray standing waves (XSW) generated by
depositing bilayers between Pt waveguide structures. High interface selectivity
of nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) under the XSW technique allowed measuring
structure and magnetism at the two interfaces, namely FeCoB-on-MgO and
MgO-on-FeCoB, yielding an interesting result that electron density and
hyperfine fields are not symmetric at both interfaces. The formation of a
high-density FeCoB layer at the MgO/FeCoB (FeCoB-on-MgO) interface with an
increased hyperfine field (~34.65 T) is attributed to the increasing volume of
FeCo at the interface due to boron diffusion from 57FeCoB to the MgO layer.
Furthermore, it caused unusual angular-dependent magnetic properties in
MgO/FeCoB bilayer, whereas FeCoB/MgO is magnetically isotropic. In contrast to
the literature, where the unusual angular dependent in FeCoB based system is
explained in terms of in-plane magnetic anisotropy, present findings attributed
the same to the interlayer exchange coupling between bulk and interface layer
within the FeCoB layer.

The measurement problem dates back to the dawn of quantum mechanics. Here, we
measure a quantum dot electron spin qubit through off-resonant coupling with
thousands of redundant nuclear spin ancillae. We show that the link from
quantum to classical can be made without any "wavefunction collapse", in
agreement with the Quantum Darwinism concept. Large ancilla redundancy allows
for single-shot readout with high fidelity $\approx99.85\%$. Repeated
measurements enable heralded initialization of the qubit and probing of the
equilibrium electron spin dynamics. Quantum jumps are observed and attributed
to burst-like fluctuations in a thermally populated phonon bath.

<br>
<br>
For free particles in a simple harmonic potential plus a weak anharmonicity,
characterized by a set of anharmonic parameters, Newtonian mechanics asserts
that there is a renormalization of the natural frequency of the periodic
motion; and statistical mechanics claims that the anharmonicity causes a
correction to the heat capacity of an ideal gas in the anharmonic potential.
The orbital motion and thermal motion depend on the same anharmonic parameters,
but in different combinations. These two manners of combinations are
fundamentally different, demonstrating that statistical law can not emerge from
the many-body limit of deterministic law for one-body.

We propose a topological winding tuple $({\cal W}_1,{\cal W}_2)$ to fully
characterize the accumulation of eigenmodes at boundaries in two-dimensional
non-Hermitian systems. Specifically, we investigate a long-ranged coupled and
non-Hermitian two-dimensional array of nanomagnets, fabricated on a thin
magnetic substrate and subjected to an in-plane magnetic field. We predict
topology-driven edge and corner accumulation of magnetic eigenmodes. By varying
the direction of the in-plane field, all magnon states accumulate either at
different edges of the array with $({\cal W}_1=\pm 1,{\cal W}_2=0)$ or $({\cal
W}_1=0,{\cal W}_2=\pm 1)$, or at different corners characterized by $({\cal
W}_1=\pm 1,{\cal W}_2=\pm 1)$. The uncovered winding tuple establishes
bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.

I revisit the long-running controversy as to the transformation properties of
temperature under Lorentz transformations, and argue that, contrary to
widespread views in some parts of the literature, `relativistic thermodynamics'
should not be understood as a generalization to relativistic physics of an
initially non-relativistic theory but as an application of a general
thermodynamic framework, neutral as to its spacetime setting, to the specific
case of relativity. More specifically, I observe that the general framework of
equilibrium thermodynamics incorporates arbitrary conserved quantities in
addition to energy and that when that framework is applied to systems in which
momentum is conserved and can be transferred between systems, it gives rise to
an unambiguous result as to the thermodynamics of moving (including
relativistically moving) systems. This leads to an equally unambiguous
prediction as to how thermodynamic temperature transforms under Lorentz
transformations (an answer coinciding with Einstein's, and Planck's, original
results.) That said, one can identify within this framework other quantities
which play a temperature-like role and have different transformation
properties; at some level it is a matter of convention and semantics which is
`the' temperature. I conclude with some brief remarks about the situation in
general relativity.

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant growth of interest
in the development of mathematical models that allow to describe effects such
as social distancing measures, the development of vaccines, and mutations.
Several of these models are based on concepts from soft matter theory.
Considerably less well investigated is the reverse direction, i.e., how results
from epidemiological research can be of interest for the physics of colloids
and polymers. In this work, we consider the SIR-DDFT model, a combination of
the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model from epidemiology with dynamical
density functional theory (DDFT) from nonequilibrium soft matter physics, which
allows for an explicit modeling of social distancing. We extend the SIR-DDFT
model both from an epidemiological perspective by incorporating vaccines,
asymptomaticity, reinfections, and mutations, and from a soft matter
perspective by incorporating noise and self-propulsion and by deriving a phase
field crystal (PFC) model that allows for a simplified description. On this
basis, we investigate via computer simulations how epidemiological models are
affected by the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. This is done in a
numerical study of a zombie outbreak.

Magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted considerable
attention recently for both fundamental understanding of magnetism and their
tunability towards device applications. The isostructural Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ and
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are two members of the Fe-based van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet
family, but exhibit very different Curie temperatures (T$_C$) of 210 K and 360
K, respectively. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
density functional theory, we systematically compare the electronic structures
of the two compounds. Qualitative similarities in the Fermi surface can be
found between the two compounds, with expanded hole pockets in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$
suggesting additional hole carriers compared to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Interestingly,
we observe no band shift in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ across its T$_C$ of 360 K, compared
to a small shift in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ across its T$_C$ of 210 K. The weak
temperature-dependent evolution strongly deviates from the expectations of an
itinerant Stoner mechanism. Our results suggest that itinerant electrons have
minimal contributions to the enhancement of T$_C$ in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ compared to
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, and that the nature of ferromagnetism in these Fe-based vdW
ferromagnets must be understood with considerations of the electron
correlations.

Material systems that exhibit tunable spin-selective conductivity are key
components of spintronic technologies. Here we demonstrate a novel type of
spin-selective transport, based on the unusual Landau level (LL) sequence
observed in bilayer WSe$_2$ under large applied magnetic fields. We find that
the conductivity depends strongly on the relative iso-spin ordering between
conducting electrons in a partially filled LL and the localized electrons of
lower energy filled LLs, with conductivity observed to be almost completely
suppressed when the spin-ratio and field-tuned Coulomb energy exceed a critical
threshold. Switching between "on/off" states is achievable through either
modulation of the external magnetic or electric fields, with many-body
interaction driving a collective switching mechanism. In contrast to
magnetoresistive heterostructures, this system achieves electrically tunable
spin filtering within a single material, driven by interaction between free and
localized spins residing in energy-separated spin/valley polarized bands.
Similar spin-selective conductivity may be realizable in multi-flat band
systems at zero magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
The superconducting state with the usual 2e-flux quantization formed from a
normal state with 3Q charge density or loop-current order is a linear
combination of 3 different paired states with an overall gauge invariant phase
and two internal phases such that the phases in equilibrium are at $2\pi/3$
with respect to each other. In the fluctuation regime of such a 3-component
superconductor, internal phase fluctuations are of the same class as for
frustrated classical xy-spins on a triangular lattice. The fluctuation region
is known therefore to be abnormally extended below the mean-field or the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature. A 6e-flux and a 4e-flux quantized
states can be constructed which are also eigenstates of the BCS Hamiltonian and
stationary points of the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy with a transition
temperature above that of the renormalized 2e-flux quantized state. Such states
have no internal phases and so no frustrating internal phase fluctuations.
These state however cannot acquire long-range order because their free-energy
is higher than the co-existing fluctuating state of 2e flux-quantization. 6e-
as well as 4e- flux-quantized Little-Parks oscillations however occur in which
the resistivity increases periodically with field above that of the
2e-fluctuating state in its extended fluctuation regime, as are observed,
followed at low temperatures to a condensation of the time-reversal odd
2e-quantized state

This article presents a dissipative method of creating a spin steady state,
or a state whose spin expectation values approaches a fixed value over time,
using a trapped gas of ultracold atoms coupled to a background BEC. The
ultracold atoms are trapped in a double potential well embedded in a wide
harmonic trap, which has a higher energy level than the double wells. The
trapped atoms are then excited out of the double well trap into the harmonic
trap using Raman lasers. Due to the coupling of the system to the background
BEC, the atoms are then able to return to the double potential well by emitting
an excitation into the background BEC, which serves as a reservoir of these
excitations. By repeatedly coupling and uncoupling the trapped ultracold atoms
and the background BEC over fixed intervals of time, the expectation value of
the total spin of these atoms will, over time, reach a steady - state value.

We investigate the structural, vibrational, morphological, and electronic
properties of Nb substituted orthovanadate LaV$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_4$ samples
prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The x-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis reveals the presence of three crystal structures [monoclinic monazite
($m-m$) type for the $x=$ 0, two-phase equilibrium of monoclinic monazite
($m-m$) and tetragonal scheelite ($t-s$) type for the 0.2$\leq$$x$$\leq$0.8,
and monoclinic fergusonite ($m-f$) type for the $x=$ 1 samples] with an
increase in Nb$^{5+}$ concentration. The Raman spectroscopy and x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to study the vibrational and
electronic properties of all the samples, respectively. In order to choose an
excitation wavelength that does not cause undesirable fluorescence and has
observable intensities of all the vibrational modes, the Raman spectra are
collected using 532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm laser lines. With increasing the
Nb$^{5+}$ concentration, new Raman modes associated with Nb-bonds are clearly
visible and the intensity of V-bonds assigned modes is decreasing. The XPS
analysis shows the unchanged 3+ oxidation state of La ion where the intensity
of the V 2$p$ core-level decreases while the Nb 3$d$ core-level increases with
$x$. The equal spin-orbit energy splitting of the states is confirmed by the
average energy difference (across La core-level spectra for all the samples)
for state I as well as bonding and anti-bonding of state II. Interesting, the
relative intensity of La 3$d$ state I and state II show systematic change with
Nb doping altering the metal ligand overlap. We discuss and provide insight
into the evolution of the structural, morphological, and chemical features with
Nb substitution in LaV$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_4$ samples.

We propose a novel model which efficiently describes the magnetization
dynamics in a magnetic bilayer system. By applying a particular gauge
transformation to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, we successfully
convert the model into an exactly integrable framework. Thus the obtained
analytical solutions allows us to predict a 1D magnetic soliton pair existed by
tunning the thickness of the spacing layer between the two ferrimagnetic
layers. The decoupling-unlocking-locking transition of soliton motion is
determined at various interaction intensitiy. Our results have implications for
the manipulation of magnetic solitons and the design of magnetic soliton-based

Despite the blooming interest, the transition-metal rare-earth ferrimagnets
have not been comprehensively understood in terms of their coercivity and
transport properties. Here, we report a systematic study of the magnetic and
transport properties of ferrimagnetic FeTb alloy by varying the layer thickness
and temperature. The FeTb is tuned from the Tb-dominated regime to the
Fe-dominated regime via the layer thickness, without varying the composition.
The coercivity closely follows the $1/\cos\theta_H$ scaling (where $\theta_H$
is the polar angle of the external magnetic field) and increases
quasi-exponentially upon cooling (exceeding 90 kOe at low temperatures),
revealing that the nature of the coercivity is the thermally-assisted domain
wall depinning field. The resistivity exhibits a quasi-linear upturn upon
cooling possibly due to thermal vibrations of the structure factor of the
amorphous alloy. The existing scaling laws of the anomalous Hall effect in the
literature break down for the amorphous FeTb that are either Fe- or
Tb-dominated. These findings should advance the understanding of the
transition-metal-rare-earth ferrimagnets and the associated ferrimagnetic
phenomena in spintronics.

<h3>Quadrupole Insulator without Corner States in the Energy Spectrum</h3>

<br>
<br>
The quadrupole insulator is a well-known instance of higher-order topological
insulators in two dimensions, which possesses midgap corner states in both the
energy spectrum and entanglement spectrum. Here, by constructing and exploring
a model Hamiltonian under a staggered $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field that respects
momentum-glide reflection symmetries, we surprisingly find a quadrupole
insulator that lacks zero-energy corner modes in its energy spectrum, despite
possessing a nonzero quadrupole moment. Remarkably, the existence of midgap
corner modes is found in the entanglement spectrum. Since these midgap states
cannot be continuously eliminated, the quadrupole insulator cannot be
continuously transformed into a trivial topological insulator, thereby
confirming its topological nature. We show that the breakdown of the
correspondence between the energy spectrum and entanglement spectrum occurs due
to the closure of the edge energy gap when the Hamiltonian is flattened.
Finally, we present a model that demonstrates an insulator with corner modes in
the energy spectrum even in the absence of the quadrupole moment. In this
phase, the entanglement spectrum does not display any midgap states. The
results suggest that the bulk-edge correspondence of quadrupole insulators
generally manifests in the entanglement spectrum rather than the energy
spectrum.

Systems operating out of equilibrium can be maneuvered to perform mechanical

to perform mechanical work. In this Letter we examine limits of work extraction
from an active system by considering the transport of a particle coupled to the
density field gradient of an active viscoelastic medium. The active energy is
provided by a gliding activation front that converts a passive to an active
medium. We demonstrate that the maximum extracted power undergoes a
discontinuous transition to zero as the ratio of the activity and the
activation rate exceeds a critical value. Our model provides a framework for
designing efficient mechanisms of transport in synthetic materials.

We describe briefly a possible coagulation mechanism for unipolar nanodust
clouds of 3 nm single charged metal nanoparticles. A theoretical dependence of
the critical cloud concentration vs the Hamaker constant is derived and
compared with available experimental data for Au, Ag, and Cu. Curious empty 1-3
um spheres, precipitated from the clouds in the result of coagulation, are
discussed. The work may be interesting for nanoprinting and initial planetary

UTe$_2$ is a promising spin-triplet superconductor candidate for which high
quality samples with long mean free paths have recently become available,
thereby enabling quantum oscillation measurements to probe the Fermi surface of
this material. The dimensionality of Fermi surface sections of a triplet
superconductor can have important implications regarding the topological
properties of the superconductivity. For example, UTe$_2$ has been proposed to
possess a chiral superconducting order parameter, which could result in the
formation of topologically protected Majorana surface states. Here, we report
the observation of oscillatory components in the magnetoconductance of UTe$_2$
at high magnetic fields. We find that these oscillations are very well
described by quantum interference between quasiparticles traversing
semiclassical trajectories spanning magnetic breakdown networks. Our
observations are fully consistent with a quasi-2D model of this material's
Fermi surface based on prior dHvA-effect measurements. Our results indicate
that UTe$_2$ -- which exhibits incredibly complex physical properties --
possesses a remarkably simple Fermi surface consisting exclusively of two
quasi-2D cylindrical sections.

Chemically driven fluids can demix to form condensed droplets that exhibit
phase behaviors not observed at equilibrium. In particular, nonequilibrium
interfacial properties can emerge when the chemical reactions are driven
differentially between the interior and exterior of the phase-separated
droplets. Here, we use a minimal model to study changes in the interfacial
tension between coexisting phases away from equilibrium. Simulations of both
droplet nucleation and interface roughness indicate that the nonequilibrium
interfacial tension can either be increased or decreased relative to its
equilibrium value, depending on whether the driven chemical reactions are
accelerated or decelerated within the droplets. Finally, we show that these
observations can be understood using a predictive theory based on an effective
thermodynamic equilibrium.

<h3>Observation of open Fermi surface in bismuth</h3>

Bismuth is a candidate material for three dimensional higher dimensional
topological insulators. We performed electronic transport experiments on small
diameter crystalline bismuth nanowires to clarify the role of the proposed
hinge channels in the interlayer coupling. The magnetoresistance presents a
sequence of peaks at Yamaji magic angles for which the interlayer group
velocity is zero pointing to flat bands due to the layered structure.
Furthermore, we observe a peak for high magnetic fields applied parallel to the
layers, a definitive signature of interlayer coherence that enables deduction
of the interlayer transfer integral of 8 meV. We demonstrate transport by a
corrugated open Fermi surface of holes that is extended, with the high angular
precision of around 0.016 rad in the interlayer direction. The observations
indicate that coherence and the crystallographic direction set by hinges play a
key role in the interlayer coupling of bismuth.

Concurrent natural time scales related to relaxation, recombination,
trapping, and drifting processes rule the semiconductor heterostructures'
response to external drives when charge carrier fluxes are induced. This paper
highlights the role of stoichiometry not only for the quantitative tuning of
the electron-hole dynamics but also for significant qualitative contrasts of
time-resolved optical responses during the operation of resonant tunneling
devices. Therefore, similar device architectures and different compositions
have been compared to elucidate the correlation among structural parameters,
radiative recombination processes, and electron-hole pair and minority carrier
relaxation mechanisms. When these ingredients intermix with the electronic
structure in Sb-based tunneling devices, it is proven possible to assess
various time scales according to the intensity of the current flux, contrary to
what has been observed in As-based tunneling devices with similar design and
transport characteristics. These time scales are strongly affected not only by
the filling process in the $\Gamma$ and L states in Sb-based double-barrier
quantum wells but also by the small separation between these states, compared
to similar heterostructures based on As.

<h3>Effective impurity behavior emergent from non-Hermitian proximity effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-Hermitian boundaries commonly take place in many open quantum systems
locally coupled to a surrounding environment. Here, we reveal a type of
non-Hermitian effect induced by non-Hermitian boundaries, the non-Hermitian
proximity effect (NHPE), which describes the penetration of non-Hermiticity
from the boundary into the bulk. For gapped quantum systems, the NHPE generates
in-gap states with imaginary eigenenergies, termed ``imaginary in-gap states".
The imaginary in-gap states are localized at the system boundary and decay into
the bulk, analogous to the behaviors of the conventional impurity states.
However, in contrast to impurity states, the imaginary in-gap states exhibit
distinct dynamical behaviors under time-evolution. Moreover, they are
physically manifested as corner modes under open boundaries, as a combined
result of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and NHPE. These results not only
uncover implicit similarities between quantum systems with non-Hermitian
boundaries and impurity physics, but also point to intriguing non-Hermitian
phenomena broadly relevant to open quantum systems.

<h3>Low-energy tail of the spectral density for a particle interacting with  a quantum phonon bath</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00616" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00616</a>
<br>
<i>Donghwan Kim, Bertrand I. Halperin</i>
<br>
<br>
We describe two approximation methods designed to capture the leading
behavior of the low-energy tail of the momentum-dependent spectral density
$A(\mathbf{k}, E)$ and the tunneling density of states $D(E)$ for an injected
particle, such as an electron or an exciton, interacting with a bath of phonons
at a non-zero initial temperature $T$, including quantum corrections due to the
non-zero frequencies of the relevant phonons. In our imaginary-time-dependent
Hartree (ITDH) approximation, we consider a situation where the particle is
injected into a specified coherent state of the phonon system, and we show how
one can use the ITDH approximation to obtain the correlation function $C(\tau)$
for that initial state. The thermal average $C(\tau)$ is obtained, in
principle, by integrating the result over all possible initial phonon coherent
states, weighted by a thermal distribution. However, in the low-energy tail,
one can obtain a good first approximation by considering only initial states
near the one that maximizes the integrand. Our second approximation, the
fixed-wave-function (FWF) approximation, assumes that the wave function of the
injected particle evolves instantaneously to a wave function which then is
independent of time, while the phonon system continues to evolve due to
interaction with the particle. We discuss how to invert the Laplace transform
and how to obtain $A(\mathbf{k},E)$ as well as $D(E)$ from the imaginary-time
analysis. The FWF approximation is used to calculate $D(E)$ for a
one-dimensional continuum model of a particle interacting with acoustic
phonons, and effects due to the quantum motion of phonons are observed. In the
classical phonon limit, the dominant behaviors of both the ITDH and FWF
approximations in the low-energy tail reduce to that found in the past for a
particle in a random potential with a Gaussian statistical distribution.

<br>
<br>
Morphogenesis of living systems involves topological shape transformations
which are highly unusual in the inanimate world. Here we demonstrate that a
droplet of a nematic liquid crystal changes its equilibrium shape from a
simply-connected tactoid, which is topologically equivalent to a sphere, to a
torus, which is not simply-connected. The topological shape transformation is
caused by the interplay of nematic elastic constants, which facilitates splay
and bend of molecular orientations in tactoids but hinders splay in the
toroids. The elastic anisotropy mechanism might be helpful in understanding
topology transformations in morphogenesis and paves the way to control and
transform shapes of droplets of liquid crystals and related soft materials.

<h3>Parameterized Density Functional Models for Block Copolymer Melts</h3>

The derivation of density functional energies from the random phase
approximation of self-consistent mean field theory is generalized and applied
to a binary blend of diblock copolymers and homopolymers. A nonlocal
transformation is incorporated into the density functional model prior to the
strong segregation extrapolation step employed by Uneyama and Doi. The
transformation affords a systematic parameterization of the free energy that
preserves key structural features such as scattering structure factor. A simple
choice of transformation is shown to incorporate the Tuebner and Strey
microemulsion structure factor and provide a reduction to the microemulsion
free energy. Without adjustable parameters, the associated phase diagrams are
compared to experimental and self consistent mean field based results. A
gradient descent of the free energy recovers dependence of end-state morphology
on initial configurations, and identifies coexisting microstructures and
transitions to two-phase behavior. Small angle x-ray data is simulated and used
in classification of microphase morphology.

The study of heat transport in micro/nanoscale structures due to their
application, especially in Nanoelectronics, is a matter of interest. In other
words, the precise simulation of the temperature distribution inside the
transistors is consequential in designing and building more reliable devices
reaching lower maximum temperatures during the operation. The present study
constitutes a framework for micro/nanoscale heat transport study which leads to
the calculation of accurate temperature/heat flux profiles with low
computational cost. The newly non-dimensional parameter {\gamma}, presenting
the strength of the nonlocality, is utilized through the nonlocal DPL modeling
(NDPL). Alongside the calculating nonlocality coefficient, the factors also
appearing in DPL, including the temperature jump, phase lagging ratio, are
revisited. The factor {\gamma} is found to have a linear relationship with
Knudsen (Kn) number, being 3.5 for Kn=10 and 0.035 for Kn=0.1. Although the
nonlocality is bold for the large Knudsen numbers, it also plays a vital role
for low Knudsen number structures especially at earlier times. Further, It is
obtained that intruding {\gamma} is critical for obtaining accurate temperature
and heat flux distributions which are very close to the practical results of
Phonon Boltzmann equation.

Employing acoustofluidic simulations, we study the propulsion of cone-shaped
nano- and microparticles by a traveling ultrasound wave. In particular, we
investigate how the acoustic propulsion of the particles depends on their size
and the energy density and frequency of the ultrasound wave. Our results reveal
that the flow field generated around the particles depends on all three of
these parameters. The results also show that the propulsion velocity of a
particle increases linearly with the particle size and energy density and that
an increase of the sound frequency leads to an increase of the propulsion
velocity for frequencies below about 1 MHz but to a decrease of the propulsion
velocity for larger frequencies. These findings are compared with preliminary
results from the literature.

Flexible ferromagnetic filaments can be used to control the flow on the
micro-scale with external magnetic field. To accurately model them, it is
crucial to know their parameters such as their magnetization and bending
modulus, the latter of which is hard to determine precisely. We present a
method how the ferromagnetic filament's shape in a rotating field can be used
to determine the magnetoelastic number $Cm$ - the ratio of magnetic to elastic
forces. Then once the magnetization of the filament is known, it is possible to
determine its bending modulus. The main idea of the method is that $Cm$ is the
only parameter that determines whether the filament is straight or whether its
tips are bent towards the magnetic field direction. Comparing with numerical
solutions, we show that the method results in an error of $15...20\%$ for the
determined $Cm$, what is more precise than estimations from other methods. This
method will allow to improve the comparability between theoretical filament
models and experimental measurements.

Suspensions of anisotropic particles are commonly encountered in a wide
spectrum of applications, including industrial and architectural coatings,
targeted drug delivery and manufacturing of fiber-reinforced composites. A
grand challenge in the field of chemical and material processing is robust
production of strongly aligned fibers at the microscopic level, as this is
routinely linked with enhanced mechanical properties at the macroscopic level.
While the investigation of the microstructure of anisotropic colloids in shear
flows has garnered a lot of theoretical and experimental attention, the case of
extensional flow remains poorly understood due to several experimental
challenges. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for predicting
the steady and transient orientations of anisotropic particles in a flowing
liquid undergoing precisely defined steady and time-dependent planar
extensional flow at the stagnation point of a Stokes trap device. In
particular, we analytically solve the Fokker-Planck equation for estimating the
probability distribution function describing the orientation dynamics of
rod-like objects as a function of flow strength (Peclet number, Pe) and probing
frequency (Deborah number, De). The theoretical results are compared with
recent experiments and reasonable agreement is found. We also discuss the
challenges involved in obtaining a full closed-form solution for the transient
dynamics of anisotropic particles in oscillatory time-dependent extensional
flow. Overall, our theoretical framework provides a way to compare the
orientation dynamics of rod-like particles with experiments that have been
performed using a new experimental technique involving the Stokes trap and
precise flow-control over the orientation of particles.

Long lifetimes of spatially indirect excitons (IXs), also known as interlayer
excitons, allow implementing both quantum exciton systems and long-range
exciton transport. Van der Waals heterostructures (HS) composed of atomically
thin layers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) offer the opportunity to
explore IXs in moir\'e superlattices. The moir\'e IXs in TMD HS form the
materials platform for exploring the Bose-Hubbard physics and superfluid and
insulating phases in periodic potentials. IX transport in TMD HS was
intensively studied and diffusive IX transport with $1/e$ decay distances
$d_{1/e}$ up to $\sim 3$ $\mu$m was realized. In this work, we present in
MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS the IX long-range transport with $d_{1/e}$ exceeding 100
$\mu$m and diverging at the optical excitation resonant to spatially direct
excitons. The IX long-range transport vanishes at high temperatures. With
increasing IX density, IX localization, then IX long-range transport, and then
IX reentrant localization is observed. The results are in qualitative agreement
with the Bose-Hubbard theory of bosons in periodic potentials predicting
superfluid at $N \sim 1/2$ and insulating at $N \sim 0$ and $N \sim 1$ phases
for the number of bosons per site of the periodic potential $N$.

<br>
<br>
We conducted an investigation on the temperature and magnetic field
dependence of the elastic properties of UCoAl. The longitudinal elastic
stiffness, $C_{33}$, exhibits significant softening as the system approaches
the critical endpoint (CEP). This softening is indicative of an ultrasonic
dispersion phenomenon, where the anomaly in the elastic constants diminishes
with increasing measurement frequency. Fine structures were observed near the
CEP in higher frequencies. The magnetic field dependence of $C_{33}$ can be
explained by assuming a specific field dependence of the relaxation time.
Remarkably, we recorded a relaxation time of 3.5$\times$10$^{-8}$ s in the
vicinity of the CEP, which is the longest observed value among solids. These
peculiar ultrasonic properties cannot be explained solely by Ising-like
ferromagnetic fluctuations, suggesting the involvement of the quadrupole
(orbital) degree of freedom in the formation of the CEP. We discussed the
origin of these observed phenomena in relation to the magnetic ground state of
the UCoAl system.

<br>
Polarons - fermionic charge carriers bearing a strong companion lattice
deformation - exhibit a natural tendency for self-localization due to the
recursive interaction between electrons and the lattice. While polarons are
ubiquitous in insulators, how they evolve in transitions to metallic and
superconducting states in quantum materials remains an open question. Here, we
use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to track the electron-lattice
coupling in the colossal magneto-resistive bi-layer manganite
La$_{1.2}$Sr$_{1.8}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ across its metal-to-insulator transition. The
response in the insulating high-temperature state features harmonic emissions
of a dispersionless oxygen phonon at small energy transfer. Upon cooling into
the metallic state, we observe a drastic redistribution of spectral weight from
the region of these harmonic emissions to a broad high energy continuum. In
concert with theoretical calculations, we show that this evolution implies a
shift in electron-lattice coupling from static to dynamic lattice distortions
that leads to a distinct polaronic ground state in the low temperature metallic
phase - a dynamic polaron liquid.

An interesting concept that has been underexplored in the context of
time-dependent simulations is the correlation of total magnetization, $C(t)$%.
One of its main advantages over directly studying magnetization is that we do
not need to meticulously prepare initial magnetizations. This is because the
evolutions are computed from initial states with spins that are independent and
completely random. In this paper, we take an important step in demonstrating
that even for time evolutions from other initial conditions, $C(t_{0},t)$, a
suitable scaling can be performed to obtain universal power laws. We
specifically consider the significant role played by the second moment of
magnetization. Additionally, we complement the study by conducting a recent
investigation of random matrices, which are applied to determine the critical
properties of the system. Our results show that the aging in the time series of
magnetization influences the spectral properties of matrices and their ability
to determine the critical temperature of systems.

The atomic doping of open-shell nanographenes enables the precise tuning of
their electronic and magnetic state, which is crucial for their promising
potential applications in optoelectronics and spintronics. Among this
intriguing class of molecules, triangulenes stand out with their size-dependent
electronic properties and spin states, which can also be influenced by the
presence of dopant atoms and functional groups. However, the occurrence of
Jahn-Teller distortions in such systems can have a crucial impact on their
total spin and requires further theoretical and experimental investigation. In
this study, we examine the nitrogen-doped aza-triangulene series via a
combination of density functional theory and on-surface synthesis. We identify
a general trend in the calculated spin states of aza-[n]triangulenes of various
sizes, separating them into two symmetry classes, one of which features
molecules that are predicted to undergo Jahn-Teller distortions that reduce
their symmetry and thus their total spin. We link this behavior to the location
of the central nitrogen atom relative to the two underlying carbon sublattices
of the molecules. Consequently, our findings reveal that centrally-doped
aza-triangulenes have one less radical than their undoped counterparts,
irrespective of their predicted symmetry. We follow this by demonstrating the
on-surface synthesis of {\pi}-extended aza-[5]triangulene, a large member of
the higher symmetry class without Jahn-Teller distortions, via a simple
one-step annealing process on Cu(111) and Au(111). Using scanning probe
microscopy and spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we prove
that the molecule is positively charged on the Au(111) substrate, with a
high-spin quintet state of S = 2, the same total spin as undoped neutral
[5]triangulene.

The three-dimensional magneto-conductivity tensor was derived in a gauge
invariant form based on the Kubo formula considering the quantum effect under a
magnetic field, such as the Landau quantization and the quantum oscillations.
We analytically demonstrated that the quantum formula of the
magneto-conductivity can be obtained by adding a quantum oscillation factor to
the classical formula. This result establishes the quantum--classical
correspondence, which has long been missing in magnetotransport phenomena.
Moreover, we found dissipative-to-dissipationless crossover in the Hall
conductivity by paying special attention to the analytic properties of thermal
Green's function. Finally, by calculating the magnetoresistance of semimetals,
we identified a phase shift in quantum oscillation originating from the
dissipationless transport predominant at high fields.

The traditional display of elements in the periodic table is convenient for
the study of chemistry and physics. However, the atomic number alone is
insufficient for training statistical machine learning models to describe and
extract composition-structure-property relationships. Here, we assess the
similarity and correlations contained within high-dimensional local and
distributed representations of the chemical elements, as implemented in an
open-source Python package ElementEmbeddings. These include element vectors of
up to 200 dimensions derived from known physical properties, crystal structure
analysis, natural language processing, and deep learning models. A range of
distance measures are compared and a clustering of elements into familiar
groups is found using dimensionality reduction techniques. The cosine
similarity is used to assess the utility of these metrics for crystal structure
prediction, showing that they can outperform the traditional radius ratio rules
for the structural classification of AB binary solids.

<br>
Anelasticity, as an intrinsic property of amorphous solids, plays a
significant role in understanding their relaxation and deformation mechanism.
However, due to the lack of long-range order in amorphous solids, the
structural origin of anelasticity and its distinction from plasticity remain
elusive. In this work, we study the transition from anelasticity to plasticity
transition in a two-dimensional model glass. Three distinct mechanical
behaviours, namely elasticity, anelasticity, and plasticity, are identified
with control parameters in the amorphous solid. Through the study of finite
size effects on these mechanical behaviors, it is revealed that anelasticity
can be distinguished from plasticity. Anelasticity serves as an intrinsic
bridge connecting the elasticity and plasticity of amorphous solids.
Additionally, it is observed that anelastic events are localized, while plastic
events are subextensive. The transition from anelasticity to plasticity is
found to resemble the entanglement of long-range interactions between element
excitations. This study sheds light on the fundamental nature of anelasticity
as a key property of element excitations in amorphous solids.

interacting quantum Hamiltonian. The VES can be expressed in terms of the
variation of the density operators or static correlation functions. We derive
the algebraic relationship between a known pure state density matrix and its
variation, and obtain the VES by applying this relation to the averaged
Heisenberg-equations-of-motion for the exact density matrix. Additionally, we
provide a direct expression of the VES in terms of correlation functions to
make it computable. We present three nontrivial applications of the VES: a
perturbation calculation of correlation functions of the transverse field Ising
model in arbitrary spatial dimensions, a study of a longitudinal field
perturbation to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model at the
critical point and variational calculation of magnetization and ground state
energy of the two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice.
For the second one, our results not only recover the scaling limit, but also
indicate the possibility of continuous tuning of the critical exponents by
adjusting the longitudinal fields differently from the scaling limit. For the
Heisenberg model, we obtained results numerically comparable to established
results with simple calculations. The VES approach provides a powerful and
versatile tool for studying interacting quantum systems.

The phenomenon of anti-gravity can be fascinating in any field, with its
presence seen in art, films and scientific research. This phenomenon is a
captivating and pertinent subject with practical applications, such as Penning
traps for antimatter confinement and Ion traps as essential architectures for
quantum computing models. In our project, we reproduced the 1893 water bridge
experiment using glycerol and firstly observed that lump-like macroscopic
dipole moments can undergo near-periodic oscillations that exhibit anti-gravity
effects and do not need classical bridge form. By combining our experimental
findings with dynamic analysis, artificial neural networks, and theory, we
established the force acting on the antigravity mechanism. Our discovery
challenges the conventional belief that antigravity necessitates a bridge
structure and opens up a new perspective, leading to a deeper understanding of
the new trap mechanism under strong electric fields with a single pair of
electrodes.

LnSbTe (Ln - lanthanide) group of materials, belonging to ZrSiS/PbFCl
(P4/nmm) structure type, is a platform to study the phenomena originating from
the interplay between the electronic correlations, magnetism, structural
instabilities and topological electronic structure. Here we report a systematic
study of magnetic properties and magnetic structures of LnSbTe materials. The
studied materials undergo antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 2.1 K (Ln = Er),
6.7 K (Ln = Dy), 3.1 K (Ln = Nd). Neutron powder diffraction reveals ordering
with k1 = (1/2 + d 0 0) in ErSbTe, k2 = (1/2 0 1/4) in NdSbTe. DySbTe features
two propagation vectors k2 and k4 = (0 0 1/2). No long-range magnetic order is
observed in PrSbTe down to 1.8 K. We propose the most probable models of
magnetic structures, discuss their symmetry and possible relation between the
electronic structure and magnetic ordering.

<br>
<br>
At thermal equilibrium, we find that generalized susceptibilities encoding
the static physical response properties of Hermitian many-electron systems
possess inherent non-Hermitian (NH) matrix symmetries, emerging solely due to
Fermi-Dirac statistics. This leads to the generic occurrence of exceptional
points (EPs), i.e., NH spectral degeneracies, in the generalized
susceptibilities of prototypical Fermi-Hubbard models, as a function of a
single parameter such as chemical potential. We demonstrate that these EPs
promote correlation-induced thermodynamic instabilities, such as
phase-separation occurring in the proximity of a Mott transition, to a
topologically stable phenomenon.

The Li$_2$S-P$_2$S$_5$ pseudo-binary system has been a valuable source of
promising superionic conductors, with $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$,
$\beta$-Li$_3$PS$_4$, HT-Li$_7$PS$_6$, and Li$_7$P$_3$S$_{11}$ having excellent
room temperature Li-ion conductivity > 0.1 mS/cm. The metastability of these
phases at ambient temperature motivates a study to quantify thermodynamic
accessibility. Through calculating the electronic, configurational, and
vibrational sources of free energy from first principles, a phase diagram of
the crystalline Li$_2$S-P$_2$S$_5$ space is constructed. Well-established phase
stability trends from experiments are recovered, such as polymorphic phase
transitions in Li$_7$PS$_6$ and Li$_3$PS$_4$, and the metastability of
Li$_7$P$_3$S$_{11}$ at high temperature. At ambient temperature, it is
predicted that all superionic conductors in this space are indeed metastable,
but thermodynamically accessible. Vibrational and configurational sources of
entropy are shown to be essential towards describing the stability of
superionic conductors. New details of the Li sublattices are revealed, and are
found to be crucial towards accurately predicting configurational entropy. All
superionic conductors contain significant configurational entropy, which
suggests an inherent correlation between superionic conductivity and high
configurational entropy.

<h3>Improved mean-field dynamical equations are able to detect the two-steps  relaxation in glassy dynamics at low temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00882</a>

<i>David Machado, Roberto Mulet, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the stochastic relaxation dynamics of the Ising p-spin model on a
random graph, a well-known model with glassy dynamics at low temperatures. We
introduce and discuss a new closure scheme for the master equation governing
the continuous-time relaxation of the system, that translates into a set of
differential equations for the evolution of local probabilities. The solution
to these dynamical mean-field equations describes very well the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics at high temperatures, notwithstanding the key
observation that the off-equilibrium probability measure contains higher-order
interaction terms, not present in the equilibrium measure. In the
low-temperature regime, the solution to the dynamical mean-field equations
shows the correct two-step relaxation (a typical feature of the glassy
dynamics), but with a relaxation timescale too short. We propose a solution to
this problem by identifying the range of energies where entropic barriers play
a key role and defining a renormalized microscopic timescale for the dynamical
mean-field solution. The final result perfectly matches the complex
out-of-equilibrium dynamics computed through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

<h3>Detection of persistent current correlation in cavity-QED</h3>

<br>
<br>
We simulated the radiative response of the cavity quantum electrodynamics
(QED) inductively coupled to the ring pierced by magnetic flux, and analyzed
its spectral dependence to get insight into persistent current dynamics.
Current fluctuations in the ring induce changes in the microwave resonator:
shifting the resonant frequency and changing its damping. We use the linear
response theory and calculate the current response function by means of the
Green function technique. Our model contains two quantum dots which divide the
ring into two arms with different electron transfers. There are two opposite
(symmetric and asymmetric) components of the persistent current, which
interplay can be observed in the response functions. The resonator reflectance
shows characteristic shifts in the dispersive regime and avoided crossings at
the resonance points. The magnitude of the resonator frequency shift is greater
for coupling to the arm with higher transparency. Fluctuations of the symmetric
component of the persistent current are relevant for a wide range of the
Aharovov-Bohm phase $\phi$, while the asymmetric component becomes dominant
close to $\phi\approx \pi$ (when the total persistent current changes its
orientation)

<h3>Exact results of one-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model</h3>

We present analytical results of fundamental properties of one-dimensional
(1D) Hubbard model with a repulsive interaction, ranging from fractional
excitations to universal thermodynamics, interaction-driven criticality,
correlation functions, Contact susceptibilities and quantum cooling. Using the
exact solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations of the Hubbard model, we first
rigorously calculate the gapless spin and charge excitations, exhibiting exotic
features of fractionalized spinons and holons. Based on the analysis on the
fractional charge and spin excitations, the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid
with only the charge propagation mode is elucidated by the asymptotic of the
two-point correlation functions with the help of the conformal field theory.
Near quadruple critical point, we then further analytically obtain the
thermodynamical properties, dimensionless ratios and scaling functions near
quantum phase transitions in terms of chemical potential, magnetic field and
interaction. In particular, we determine additivity rules of spin and charge
susceptibilities, and derive explicit forms of thermodynamics of
spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid. Finally, in order to capture deeper insight
into the Mott insulator and interaction driven criticality, we further study
the double occupancy and its associated Contact and Contact susceptibilities
through which an adiabatic cooling scheme upon the quantum criticality is
introduced.

<br>

The TiSiCO-family monolayers have recently been attracting significant
attention due to their unique valley-layer coupling (VLC). In this work, we
present a minimal, four-band tight-binding (TB) model to capture the low-energy
physics of the TiSiCO-family monolayers $X_{2}Y$CO$_{2}$ ($X=$ Ti, Zr, Hf; $Y=$
Si, Ge) with strong VLC. These monolayers comprise two $X$ atom layers
separated by approximately $4$ \AA ~in the out-of-plane direction. Around each
valley ($X$ or $X'$), the conduction and valence bands are mainly dominated by
the $A_{1}\{d_{z^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2})}\}$ and $B_{2}\{d_{yz}\}$ orbitals of the top
$X$ atoms,and the $A_{1}\{d_{z^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2})}\}$ and $B_{1}\{d_{xz}\}$
orbitals of the bottom $X$ atoms. Using these four states as a basis, we
construct a symmetry-allowed TB model. Through parameter fitting from
first-principles calculations, the four-band TB model not only reproduces the
electronic band structure, but also captures the strong VLC, high-order
topology, and valley-contrasting linear dichroism of the monolayers.
Furthermore, the TB model reveals that these monolayers may exhibit various
intriguing topological phases under electric fields and biaxial strains. Hence,
the TB model established here can serve as the starting point for future
research exploring the physics related to VLC and the $X_{2}Y$CO$_{2}$
monolayers.

<h3>Cavity-Induced Strong Magnon-Magnon Coupling in Altermagnets</h3>

Long-distance strong coupling between short-wavelength magnons remains an
outstanding challenge in quantum magnonics, an emerging interdiscipline between
magnonics and quantum information science. Recently, altermagnets are
identified as the third elementary class of magnets that break the
time-reversal symmetry without magnetization and thus combine characteristics
of conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. In this work, we
show that cavity photons can mediate the long-distance strong coupling of
exchange magnons with opposite chiralities in altermagnets, manifesting as an
anticrossing of the magnon-polariton spectrum in the extremely dispersive
regime. The predicted effective magnon-magnon coupling strongly depends on the
magnon propagation direction, and is thus highly anisotropic. Our findings are
intimately connected to the intrinsic nature of altermagnetic magnons, i.e.,
chirality-splitting-induced crossing of exchange magnons, which has no
counterpart in conventional ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, and may open a
new path way for magnon-based quantum information processing in altermagnets.

Under operating conditions, the dynamics of water and ions confined within
protonic aluminosilicate zeolite (H-AS) micropores are responsible for many of
their properties, including hydrothermal stability, acidity and catalytic
activity. However, due to high computational cost, operando studies of H-AS are
currently rare and limited to specific cases and simplified models. In this
work, we have developed a general potential energy surface interpolator with
consistent accuracy for the entire class of H-AS, including the full range of
experimentally relevant water concentrations and Si/Al ratios, via a reactive
neural network potential (NNP). This NNP combines dramatic sampling
acceleration at the metaGGA reference level with the capacity for discovery of
new chemistry, such as collective defect formation mechanisms at the zeolite
surface. Furthermore, we show that the baseline model allows for data-efficient
adoption of higher-level (hybrid) references via $\Delta$-learning and the
acceleration of rare event sampling via automatic construction of collective
variables. This framework allows for operando simulations of realistic
catalysts at quantitative accuracy.

<h3>The deflection limit of slab-like topologically interlocked structures</h3>

<br>
<i>Silvan Ullmann, David S. Kammer, Shai Feldfogel</i>
<br>
<br>
Topologically Interlocked Structures (TIS) are structural assemblies that
achieve stability and carrying capacity through the geometric arrangement of
interlocking blocks, relying solely on normal and friction forces for load
transfer. Unlike beam-like TIS, whose deflection never exceeds the height of
the blocks, the deflection of slab-like TIS often does. Yet, the upper limit of
deflection of slab-like TIS, a key parameter defining their loading energy
capacity, remains unexplored. Here, we establish a theoretical upper bound for
the deflection capacity of slab-like TIS and outline a systematic design
strategy to approach this upper bound. This strategy is based on engineering
the contact interfaces such that the non-central blocks are more engaged in the
structural response, leading to a more global and holistic deformation mode
with higher deflections. We demonstrate the application of this strategy in a
numerical case study on a typical slab-like TIS. We show that it leads to a
350$\%$ increase in deflection, yielding a value closer to the upper bound than
previously reported in the literature. We also show that the resulting
deflection mode engages all the blocks equally, avoids localized sliding modes,
and resembles that of monolithic equivalents. Lastly, we show that the strategy
not only maximizes the assembly's deflection capacity but also its loading
energy capacity.

<h3>Influence of the Anderson transition on thermoelectric energy conversion  in disordered electronic systems</h3>

So far, the efficiency of thermoelectric energy conversion remains low
compared to traditional technologies, such as coal or nuclear. This low
efficiency can be explained by connecting the thermoelastic properties of the
electronic working fluid to its transport properties. Such connection also
shows that operating close to electronic phase transitions can be an efficient
way to boost the thermoelectric energy conversion. In this paper, we analyze
themoelectric efficiency close to the metal-insulator Anderson transition. Our
results reveal the direct link between the thermoelectric and thermoelastic
properties of Anderson-type systems. Moreover, the role of the conductivity
critical exponent in the thermoelectric energy conversion is analysed. Finally,
we show that relatively large values of the thermolectric figure of merit may
be obtained in the vicinity of the Anderson transition.

To achieve fast computation, it is crucial to reset the memory to a desired
state within a limited time. However, the inherent delay in the system's
response often prevents reaching the desired state once the control process is
completed in finite time. To address this challenge, we propose a shortcut
strategy that incorporates an auxiliary control to guide the system towards an
equilibrium state that corresponds to the intended control, thus enabling
accurate memory reset. Through the application of thermodynamic geometry, we
derive an optimal shortcut protocol for erasure processes that minimizes the
energy cost. This research provides an effective design principle for realizing
the finite-time erasure process while simultaneously reducing the energy cost,
thereby alleviating the burden of heat dissipation.

Accurate structural analysis is essential to gain physical knowledge and
understanding of atomic-scale processes in materials from atomistic
simulations. However, traditional analysis methods often reach their limits
when applied to crystalline systems with thermal fluctuations, defect-induced
distortions, partial vitrification, etc. In order to enhance the means of
structural analysis, we present a novel descriptor for encoding atomic
environments into 2D images, based on a pixelated representation of graph-like
architecture with weighted edge connections of neighboring atoms. This
descriptor is well adapted for Convolutional Neural Networks and enables
accurate structural analysis at a low computational cost. In this paper, we
showcase a series of applications, including the classification of crystalline
structures in distorted systems, tracking phase transformations up to the
melting temperature, and analyzing liquid-to-amorphous transitions in pure
metals and alloys. This work provides the foundation for robust and efficient
structural analysis in materials science, opening up new possibilities for
studying complex structural processes, which can not be described with
traditional approaches.

The phase-field crystal model (PFC) describes crystal structures at diffusive
timescales through a periodic order parameter representing the atomic density.
One of its main features is that it naturally incorporates elastic and plastic
deformation. To correctly interpret numerical simulation results or devise
extensions related to the elasticity description, it is important to have
direct access to the elastic field. In this work, we discuss its evaluation in
classical PFC models based on the Swift-Hohenberg energy functional. We
consider approaches where the stress field can be derived from the microscopic
density field (i.e., the order parameter), and a simple novel numerical routine
is proposed. By numerical simulations, we demonstrate that it overcomes some
limitations of currently used methods. Moreover, we shed light on the
elasticity description conveyed by classical PFC models, characterizing a
residual stress effect present at equilibrium. We show explicitly and discuss
the evaluation of the elastic fields in prototypical representative cases
involving an elastic inclusion, a grain boundary, and dislocations.

Coordinated cellular movements are key processes in tissue morphogenesis.
Using a cell-based modeling approach we study the dynamics of epithelial layers
lining surfaces with constant and varying curvature. We demonstrate that
extrinsic curvature effects can explain the alignment of cell elongation with
the principal directions of curvature. Together with specific self-propulsion
mechanisms and cell-cell interactions this effect gets enhanced and can explain
observed large-scale, persistent and circumferential rotation on cylindrical
surfaces. On toroidal surfaces, extrinsic curvature only plays a minor role and
the curvature coupling results primarily from intrinsic curvature. These
findings unveil the role of curvature and postulate its importance for tissue
morphogenesis.

Nanographene triangulenes with a S = 1 ground state have been used as
building blocks of antiferromagnetic Haldane spin chains realizing a symmetry
protected topological phase. By means of inelastic electron spectroscopy, it
was found that the intermolecular exchange contains both linear and non-linear
interactions, realizing the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian. Starting from a
Hubbard model, and mapping it to an interacting Creutz ladder, we analytically
derive these effective spin-interactions using perturbation theory, up to
fourth order. We find that for chains with more than two units other
interactions arise, with same order-of-magnitude strength, that entail second
neighbor linear, and three-site non-linear exchange. Our analytical expressions
compare well with experimental and numerical results. We discuss the extension
to general S = 1 molecules, and give numerical results for the strength of the
non-linear exchange for several nanographenes. Our results pave the way towards
rational design of spin Hamiltonians for nanographene based spin chains.

We discover a universal scaling law for the quasiparticle Nernst coefficient
in underdoped cuprates, whose magnitude decreases exponentially with increasing
temperature as confirmed in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$. We attribute it to the basic
mathematical structure of the conductivity formula with a narrow effective
bandwidth of nonzero Berry curvatures associated with the pseudogap. A unified
scheme is then developed to analyze transverse transport in hole-doped cuprates
and clarify the puzzling disparity in determining the pseudogap temperature
from different measurements. Our proposal opens the avenue for exploring
potential scaling laws in the intermediate temperature region and may have
broad applications in strongly correlated or narrow band systems.

The solid-state electrolyte is critical for achieving next-generation high
energy density and high-safety batteries. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs)
possess great potential for commercial application owing to their compatibility
with the existing manufacturing systems. However, unsatisfactory
room-temperature ionic conductivity severely limits its application. Herein, an
ultra-high room-temperature ionic conductivity composite solid-state
electrolyte (CSE) is prepared by introducing an appropriate amount of SiO2
nanosphere to the PVDF-HFP matrix. By doing this, the polymer particles are
divided and surrounded by SiO2. And the interface amount is maximized resulting
in the high ionic conductivity of 1.35 mS cm-1 under room temperature. In
addition, the CSE shows a wide electrochemical window of 4.95 V and a moderate
Li+ transference number of 0.44. The CSE demonstrates good stability with Li
anode, with Li symmetric cells that could cycle 1000 h at a current density of
0.2 mA cm-2. The full cell assembled with LiFePO4 (LFP) and Li metal displays a
high reversible specific capacity of 157.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, and it could
maintain 92.9% of initial capacity after 300 cycles at 3C. Moreover, the
strategy is applied in solid-state sodium/potassium batteries and displays
excellent performance.

Long-range hoppings in quantum disordered systems are known to yield quantum
multifractality, whose features can go beyond the characteristic properties
associated with an Anderson transition. Indeed, critical dynamics of long-range
quantum systems can exhibit anomalous dynamical behaviours distinct from those
at the Anderson transition in finite dimensions. In this paper, we propose a
phenomenological model of wave packet expansion in long-range hopping systems.
We consider both their multifractal properties and the algebraic fat tails
induced by the long-range hoppings. Using this model, we analytically derive
the dynamics of moments and Inverse Participation Ratios of the time-evolving
wave packets, in connection with the multifractal dimension of the system. To
validate our predictions, we perform numerical simulations of a Floquet model
that is analogous to the power law random banded matrix ensemble. Unlike the
Anderson transition in finite dimensions, the dynamics of such systems cannot
be adequately described by a single parameter scaling law that solely depends
on time. Instead, it becomes crucial to establish scaling laws involving both
the finite-size and the time. Explicit scaling laws for the observables under
consideration are presented. Our findings are of considerable interest towards
applications in the fields of many-body localization and Anderson localization
on random graphs, where long-range effects arise due to the inherent topology
of the Hilbert space.

<h3>Yielding transition of amorphous solids in the presence of aspherical  impurities</h3>

Understanding the mechanical properties of amorphous solids has been a field
of intense research not only for the zoo of interesting phenomena one observes
once these solids are subjected to external deformations but also for their
importance in industrial applications. Amorphous solids are known to have
higher yield strength compared to crystalline solids made with similar
compositions. However, they fail catastrophically via shear band formation, and
tuning their mechanical yielding is of significant importance for designing
better materials. For decades, engineers have been working on ways to improve
the ability of amorphous solids to sustain external deformations. One popular
method is micro-alloying, which involves adding small amounts of different
materials to the pure sample; while there are many examples of how
micro-alloying can improve the yield strain, the microscopic mechanism behind
it still needs to be better understood. Via extensive molecular dynamics
simulation of model amorphous solids, we have studied the effect of elongated
impurity particles on the yielding transition of these solids and show that
rod-like particles can enhance the yield threshold but can also make these
materials more brittle depending on their sphericity and the concentration. In
particular, we show that the rotational relaxation of these impurity particles
plays a significant role in suppressing or enhancing the occurrence of shear

Thin films based on silicon and transition-metal elements dominate the
semiconducting industry and are ubiquitous in all modern devices. Films have
also been produced in the rare-earth series of elements for both research and
specialized applications. Thin films of uranium and uranium dioxide were
fabricated in the 1960s and 1970s, but there was little sustained effort until
the early 2000s. Significant programmes started at Oxford University
(transferring to Bristol University in 2011), and Los Alamos National
Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, USA. In this review we cover the work that has
been published over the last ~20 years with these materials. Important
breakthroughs occurred with the fabrication of epitaxial thin films of
initially uranium metal and UO2, but more recently of many other uranium
compounds and alloys. These have led to a number of different experiments that
are reviewed, as well as some important trends. The interaction with the
substrate leads to differing strain and hence changes in properties. An
important advantage is that epitaxial films can often be made of materials that
are impossible to produce as bulk single crystals. Examples are U3O8, U2N3 and
alloys of U-Mo, which form in a modified bcc structure. Epitaxial films may
also be used in applied research. They represent excellent surfaces, and it is
at the surfaces that most of the important reactions occur in the nuclear fuel
cycle. For example, the fuel-cladding interactions, and the dissolution of fuel
by water in the long-term storage of spent fuel. To conclude, we discuss
possible future prospects, examples include bilayers containing uranium for
spintronics, and superlattices that could be used in heterostructures. Such
applications will require a more detailed knowledge of the interface
interactions in these systems, and this is an important direction for future
research.

EuTiO3 (ETO) is a well-known complex oxide mainly investigated for its
magnetic properties and its incipient ferro-electricity. In this work, we
demonstrate the realization of suspended micro-mechanical structures, such as
cantilevers and micro-bridges, from 100 nm-thick single-crystal epitaxial ETO
films deposited on top of SrTiO3(100) substrates. By combining profile analysis
and resonance frequency measurements of these devices, we obtain the Young's
modulus, strain, and strain gradients of the ETO thin films. Moreover, we
investigate the ETO anti-ferro-distorsive transition by temperature-dependent
characterizations, which show a non-monotonic and hysteretic mechanical
response. Comparison between experimental and literature data allows us to
weight the contribution from thermal expansion and softening to the tuning
slope, while a full understanding of the origin of the hysteresis is still
missing. We also discuss the influence of oxygen vacancies on the reported
mechanical properties by comparing stoichiometric and oxygen-deficient samples.

Van Hove singularity (VHS) has been considered as a driving source for
unconventional superconductivity. A VHS in two-dimensional (2D) materials
consists of a saddle point connecting electron-like and hole-like bands. In a
rare case, when a VHS appears at Fermi level, both electron-like and hole-like
conduction can coexist, giving rise to an enhanced density of states as well as
an attractive component of Coulomb interaction for unconventional electronic
pairing. However, this van Hove scenario is often destroyed by an incorrect
chemical potential or competing instabilities. Here, by using angle-resolved
photoemission measurements, we report the observation of a VHS perfectly
aligned with the Fermi level in a kagome superconductor CsV$_{3-x}$Ta$_x$Sb$_5$
(x~0.4), in which a record-high superconducting transition temperature is
achieved among all the current variants of AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K) at
ambient pressure. Doping dependent measurements reveal the important role of
van Hove scenario in boosting superconductivity, and spectroscopic-imaging
scanning tunneling microscopy measurements indicate a distinct superconducting
state in this system.

Scanning precession electron diffraction (SPED) is a powerful technique for
investigating strain. While extensive literature exists analysing strain under
high convergence angle conditions there are few systematic studies describing
work based around the use of smaller convergence angles despite this being a
common set-up. We fill in some of this gap in the literature by providing a
workflow for both the experimental and analysis components of such experiments.
Our case study investigates strained Gallium Arsenide nanowires with a modern
direct electron detector and common microscope alignments. Three peak finding
routines are compared and we provide both source code and raw data to allow
others to reproduce our findings.

The order parameter for a continuous transition shows diverging fluctuation
near the critical point. Here we show, through numerical simulations and
scaling arguments, that the inequality between the values of an order
parameter, measured near a critical point, is independent of the system size.
Quantification of such inequality through Gini index ($g$), therefore, leads to
a scaling form $g=G\left[|F-F_c|N^{1/d\nu}\right]$, where $F$ denotes the
driving parameter for the transition (e.g., temperature $T$ for ferro-para
transition at $T_c$, or lattice occupation probability $p$ near percolation
threshold $p_c$), $N$ is the system size, $d$ is the spatial dimension and
$\nu$ is the correlation length exponent. We demonstrate the scaling for the
Ising model in two and three dimensions and site percolation on square lattice.

Particles trapped at a fluid-fluid interface by capillary forces can form a
monolayer that jams and buckles when subject to uni-axial compression. Here we
investigate experimentally the buckling mechanics of monolayers of
millimeter-sized rigid plates trapped at a planar fluid-fluid interface subject
to uni-axial compression in a Langmuir trough. We quantified the buckling
wavelength and the associated force on the trough barriers as a function of the
degree of compression. To explain the observed buckling wavelength and forces
in the two-dimensional monolayer, we consider a simplified system composed of a
linear chain of plate-like particles. The chain system enables us to build a
theoretical model which is then compared to the two-dimensional monolayer data.
Both the experiments and analytical model show that the wavelength of buckling
of a monolayer of plate-like particles is of the order of the particle size, a
different scaling from the one reported for monolayers of spheres. A simple
model of buckling surface pressure is also proposed, and an analysis of the
effect of the bending rigidity resulting from a small overlap between nanosheet
particles is presented. These results can be applied to the modeling of the
interfacial rheology and buckling dynamics of interfacial layers of 2D
nanomaterials.

Silicon carbide (SiC) has become a popular material for next-generation power
components due to its smaller size, faster switching speed, simpler cooling and
greater reliability than Si-MOSFETs. With this in mind, we are thinking about
whether the replacement of Si-base with Germanium Carbide(GeC) will also have
good performance. This work explains the heat transfer of GeC by simulating the
thermal conductivity through molecular dynamics (MD) and proposes a potential
4H-GeC power MOSFET with wide bandgap and high thermal conductivity to replace
Si-MOSFETs.

Magnetic imaging using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins in diamonds is a powerful
technique for acquiring quantitative information about sub-micron scale
magnetic order. A major challenge for its application in the research on
two-dimensional (2D) magnets is the positioning of the NV centers at a
well-defined, nanoscale distance to the target material required for detecting
the small magnetic fields generated by magnetic monolayers. Here, we develop a
diamond 'dry-transfer' technique, akin to the state-of-the-art 2D-materials
assembly methods, and use it to place a diamond micro-membrane in direct
contact with the 2D interlayer antiferromagnet CrSBr. We harness the resulting
NV-sample proximity to spatially resolve the magnetic stray fields generated by
the CrSBr, present only where the CrSBr thickness changes by an odd number of
layers. From the magnetic stray field of a single uncompensated ferromagnetic
layer in the CrSBr, we extract a monolayer magnetization of $M_\mathrm{CSB}$ =
0.46(2) T, without the need for exfoliation of monolayer crystals or applying
large external magnetic fields. The ability to deterministically place
NV-ensemble sensors into contact with target materials and detect ferromagnetic
monolayer magnetizations paves the way for quantitative analysis of a wide
range of 2D magnets assembled on arbitrary target substrates.

<h3>Spin model for the Honeycomb $\rm NiPS_3$</h3>

In the Vander Waal material $\rm NiPS_3$, Ni atoms have spin S=1 and realize
a honeycomb lattice. Six sulfur atoms surround each Ni and split their d
manifold into three filled and two unfilled bands, which differ in bulk and
monolayer systems. Aimed to determine the spin Hamiltonian of $\rm NiPS_3$, we
study its exchange mechanisms using a two-band half-filled Hubbard model.
Hopping between d orbitals is mediated by p orbitals of sulfur and gives rise
to bilinear and biquadratic spin couplings in the limit of strong electronic
correlations. In bulk, a ferromagnetic first nearest neighbor $\rm J_1$ and a
more significant antiferromagnetic third nearest neighbor spin coupling $\rm
J_3$ agreed with the literature, while in monolayer $\rm J_1$ is positive and
very small in comparison. The microscopic model exposed a ferromagnetic
biquadratic spin interaction $\rm K_1$ allowing the completion of a minimal
$\rm J_1-J_3-K_1$ spin Hamiltonian for $\rm NiPS_3$. Using a variational scheme
to find the phase diagram of the system, we found that a zig-zag
antiferromagnetic order coexists with a ferroquadrupolar phase and is the most
likely ground state of bulk samples. The zig-zag pattern is adjacent to
commensurate and incommensurate spin spirals, which could hint at the puzzling
results reported in $\rm NiPS_3$ monolayers.

<h3>Piercing the Dirac spin liquid: from a single monopole to chiral states</h3>

The parton approach for quantum spin liquids gives a transparent description
of low-energy elementary excitations, e.g., spinons and emergent gauge-field
fluctuations. The latter ones are directly coupled to the hopping/pairing of
spinons. By using the fermionic representation of the $U(1)$ Dirac state on the
kagome lattice and variational Monte Carlo techniques to include the Gutzwiller
projection, we analyse the effect of modifying the gauge fields in the spinon
kinematics. In particular, we construct low-energy monopole excitations, which
are shown to be gapless in the thermodynamic limit. States with a finite number
of monopoles or with a finite density of them are also considered, with
different patterns of the gauge fluxes. We show that these chiral states are
not stabilized in the Heisenberg model with nearest-neighbor super-exchange
couplings, and the Dirac state corresponds to the lowest-energy Ansatz within
this family of variational wave functions. Our results support the idea that
spinons with a gapless conical spectrum coexist with gapless monopole
excitations, even for the spin-$1/2$ case.

Extracting reliable information on certain physical properties of materials,
like thermal behavior, such as thermal transport, which can be very
computationally demanding. Aiming to overcome such difficulties in the
particular case of lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) of 2D nanomaterials, we
propose a simple, fast, and accurate semi-empirical approach for its
calculation.The approach is based on parameterized thermochemical equations and
Arrhenius-like fitting procedures, thus avoiding molecular dynamics or
\textit{ab initio} protocols, which frequently demand computationally expensive
simulations. As proof of concept, we obtain the LTC of some prototypical
physical systems, such as graphene (and other 2D carbon allotropes), hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN), silicene, germanene, binary, and ternary BNC latices and
two examples of the fullerene network family. Our values are in good agreement
with other theoretical and experimental estimations, nonetheless being derived
in a rather straightforward way, at a fraction of the computational cost.

<h3>The weak noise theory of the O'Connell-Yor polymer as an integrable  discretisation of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation</h3>

We investigate and solve the weak noise theory for the semi-discrete
O'Connell-Yor directed polymer. In the large deviation regime, the most
probable evolution of the partition function obeys a classical non-linear
system which is a non-standard discretisation of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation with mixed initial-final conditions. We show that this system is
integrable and find its general solution through an inverse scattering method
and a novel Fredholm determinant framework that we develop. This allows to
obtain the large deviation rate function of the free energy of the polymer
model from its conserved quantities and to study its convergence to the large
deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Our model also degenerates to
the classical Toda chain, which further substantiates the applicability of our
Fredholm framework.
