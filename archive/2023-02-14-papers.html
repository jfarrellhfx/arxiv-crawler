<h3>Optimal motility strategies for self-propelled agents to explore porous  media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06709</a>

Micro-robots for, e.g., biomedical applications, need to be equipped with
motility strategies that enable them to navigate through complex environments.
Inspired by biological microorganisms we investigate motility patterns such as
run-and-reverse, run-and-tumble or run-reverse-flick applied to active rod-like
particles in silico. We investigate their capability to efficiently explore
disordered porous environments with various porosities and mean pore sizes
ranging down to the scale of the active particle. By calculating the effective
diffusivity for the different patterns, we can predict the optimal one for each
porous sample geometry. We find that providing the agent with the ability to
sense position for a certain time and to make a decision based on its
observation yields a motility pattern outperforming the biologically inspired
patterns for all investigated porous samples.

<h3>Fermi liquids beyond the forward scattering limit: the role of  non-forward scatterings for scale invariance and instabilities</h3>

Landau Fermi liquid theory is a fixed point theory of metals that includes
the forward scattering amplitudes as exact marginal couplings. However, the
fixed point theory that only includes the strict forward scatterings is
non-local in real space. In this paper, we revisit the Fermi liquid theory
using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group formalism and show
how the scale invariant fixed point emerges as a local theory. The local
low-energy effective field theory for Fermi liquids includes not only the
forward scatterings but also non-forward scatterings with small but non-zero
momentum transfers. In the low-energy limit, the non-forward scattering
amplitude takes a scale invariant form if the momentum transfer is scaled along
with the energy. If the bare coupling is attractive beyond a critical strength,
the coupling function exhibits a run-away flow, signifying potential
instabilities in particle-hole channels. What drives those instabilities is the
non-trivial renormalization group flow of the non-forward scattering
amplitudes. The pairing interaction also obeys a scaling relation if the center
of mass momentum of Cooper pairs is comparable with energy.

To increase density of superconductor digital and neuromorphic circuits by
10x and reach integration scale of $10^8$ Josephson junctions (JJs) per chip,
we developed a new fabrication process on 200-mm wafers, using self-shunted
Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb JJs and kinetic inductors. The process has a layer of JJs, a
layer of resistors, and 10 fully planarized superconducting layers: 8 Nb layers
and 2 layers of high kinetic inductance materials, Mo$_2$N and NbN, with sheet
inductance of 8 pH/sq and 3 pH/sq, respectively. NbN films were deposited by
two methods: with $T_c$=15.5 K by reactive sputtering of a Nb target in
Ar+N$_2$ mixture; with $T_c$ in the range from 9 K to 13 K by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using
Tris(diethylamido)(tert-butylimido)niobium(V) metalorganic precursor. PECVD of
NbN was investigated to obtain conformal deposition and filling narrow trenches
and vias with high depth-to-width ratios, which was not possible to achieve
using sputtering and other physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods at
temperatures below $200 ^oC$ required to prevent degradation of Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb
junctions. Nb layers with 200 nm thickness are used in the process layer stack
as ground planes to maintain a high level of interlayer shielding and low
intralayer mutual coupling, for passive transmission lines with wave impedances
matching impedances of JJs, typically <=50 $\Omega$, and for low-value
inductors. NbN and NbN/Nb bilayer are used for cell inductors. Using NbN/Nb
bilayers and individual pattering of both layers to form inductors allowed us
to minimize parasitic kinetic inductance associated with interlayer vias and
connections to JJs as well as to increase critical currents of the vias.
Fabrication details and results of electrical characterization of NbN films,
wires, and vias, and comparison with Nb properties are given.

<h3>Giant magnetoresistance of Dirac plasma in high-mobility graphene</h3>

The most recognizable feature of graphene's electronic spectrum is its Dirac
point around which interesting phenomena tend to cluster. At low temperatures,
the intrinsic behavior in this regime is often obscured by charge inhomogeneity
but thermal excitations can overcome the disorder at elevated temperatures and
create electron-hole plasma of Dirac fermions. The Dirac plasma has been found
to exhibit unusual properties including quantum critical scattering and
hydrodynamic flow. However, little is known about the plasma's behavior in
magnetic fields. Here we report magnetotransport in this quantum-critical
regime. In low fields, the plasma exhibits giant parabolic magnetoresistivity
reaching >100% in 0.1 T even at room temperature. This is orders of magnitude
higher than magnetoresistivity found in any other system at such temperatures.
We show that this behavior is unique to monolayer graphene, being underpinned
by its massless spectrum and ultrahigh mobility, despite frequent
(Planckian-limit) scattering. With the onset of Landau quantization in a few T,
where the electron-hole plasma resides entirely on the zeroth Landau level,
giant linear magnetoresistivity emerges. It is nearly independent of
temperature and can be suppressed by proximity screening, indicating a
many-body origin. Clear parallels with magnetotransport in strange metals and
so-called quantum linear magnetoresistance predicted for Weyl metals offer an
interesting playground to further explore relevant physics using this
well-defined quantum-critical 2D system.

<h3>Quantum viscosity and the Reynolds similitude in quantum liquid He-II</h3>

Reynolds similitude, a key concept in hydrodynamics, states that two
phenomena of different length scales with a similar geometry are physically
identical. Flow properties are universally determined in a unified way in terms
of the Reynolds number ${\cal R}$ (dimensionless, ratio of inertial to viscous
forces in incompressible fluids). For example, the drag coefficient $c_D$ of
objects with similar shapes moving in fluids is expressed by a universal
function of ${\cal R}$. Certain studies introduced similar dimensionless
numbers, that is, the superfluid Reynolds number ${\cal R}_s$, to characterize
turbulent flows in superfluids. However, the applicablity of the similitude to
inviscid quantum fluids is nontrivial as the original theory is applicable to
viscous fluids. This study proposed a method to verify the similitude using
current experimental techniques in quantum liquid He-II. A highly precise
relation between $c_D$ and ${\cal R}_s$ was obtained in terms of the terminal
speed of a macroscopic body falling in He-II at finite temperatures across the
Knudsen (ballistic) and hydrodynamic regimes of thermal excitations. Reynolds
similitude in superfluids can facilitate unified mutual development of
classical and quantum hydrodynamics.

<h3>Topological transition in Pb1-xSnxSe using Meta-GGA</h3>

<i>Rajibul Islam, Giuseppe Cuono, Nguyen M. Nguyen, Canio Noce, Carmine Autieri</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the mirror Chern number (MCN) and the band gap for the alloy
Pb1-xSnxSe as a function of the concentration x by using virtual crystalline
approximation. We use the electronic structure from the relativistic density
functional theory calculations in the Generalized-Gradient- Approximation (GGA)
and meta-GGA approximation. Using the modified Becke-Johnson meta- GGA
functional, our results are comparable with the available experimental data for
the MCN as well as for the band gap. We advise to use modified Becke-Johnson
approximation with the parameter c=1.10 to describe the transition from trivial
to topological phase for this class of compounds.

<h3>Finite-size and finite bond dimension effects of tensor network  renormalization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06632</a>
<br>
<i>Atsushi Ueda, Masaki Oshikawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a general procedure for extracting the running coupling constants
of the underlying field theory of a given classical statistical model on a
two-dimensional lattice, combining tensor network renormalization (TNR) and the
finite-size scaling theory of conformal field theory. By tracking the coupling
constants at each scale, we are able to visualize the renormalization group
(RG) flow and demonstrate it with the classical Ising and 3-state Potts models.
Furthermore, utilizing the new methodology, we reveal the limitations due to
finite bond dimension D on TNR applied to critical systems. We find that a
finite correlation length is imposed by the finite bond dimension in TNR, and
it can be attributed to an emergent relevant perturbation that respects the
symmetries of the system. The correlation length shows the same power-law
dependence on D as the "finite entanglement scaling" of the Matrix Product
States.

<h3>Fluctuation-dominated quantum oscillations in excitonic insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrew A. Allocca, Nigel R. Cooper</i>
<br>
<br>
The realization of excitonic insulators in transition metal dichalcogenide
systems has opened the door to explorations of the exotic properties such a
state exhibits. We study theoretically the potential for excitonic insulators
to show an anomalous form of quantum oscillations: the de Haas-van Alphen
effect in an insulating system. We focus on the role of the interactions that
generate the energy gap and show that it is crucial to consider quantum
fluctuations that go beyond the mean field treatment. Remarkably, quantum
fluctuations can be dominant, and lead to quantum oscillations than are
significantly larger than those predicted using mean field theory. Indeed, in
experimentally accessible parameter regimes these fluctuation-generated quantum
oscillations can even be larger than what would be found for the corresponding
gapless system.

<h3>Hybrid Dyons, inverted Lorentz force and magnetic Nernst effect in  quantum spin ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06635</a>
<br>
<i>Chris R. Laumann, Roderich Moessner</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological magnets host two sets of gauge fields: that of native Maxwell
electromagnetism, thanks to the magnetic dipole moment of its constituent
microscopic moments; and that of the emergent gauge theory describing the
topological phase. Here, we show that in quantum spin ice, the emergent
magnetic charges of the latter carry native electric charge of the former. We
both provide a general symmetry-based analysis underpinning this result, and
discuss a microscopic mechanism which binds a native electric charge to the
emergent magnetic one. This has important ramifications. First and foremost, an
applied electric field gives rise to an emergent magnetic field. This in turn
exerts an `inverted' Lorentz force on moving emergent electric/native magnetic
charges. This can be probed via what we term a magnetic Nernst effect: applying
an electric field perpendicular to a temperature gradient yields a
magnetisation perpendicular to both. Finally, and importantly as a further
potential experimental signature, a thermal gas of emergent magnetic charges
will make an activated contribution to the optical conductivity at low
temperatures.

<h3>Raman scattering study of multimagnon (bi- and tri-magnon) excitations  and rotonlike points in the distorted triangular lattice antiferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06642</a>
<br>
<i>Junli Li, Shangjian Jin, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the experimental signatures of Raman spectroscopy of bi- and
tri-magnon excitations in the distorted triangular lattice antiferromagnets
alpha-LCr2O4 (L=Sr, Ca). We utilize spin wave theory to analyze the nearly 120
degree spin-3/2 spiral ordered antiferromagnetic ground state to compute the
single-magnon density of states, single-magnon dispersion, and bimagnon and
trimagnon Raman spectra (polarized and unpolarized). It is found that Raman
scattering is capable of capturing the effect of the rotonlike M and M' points
on the bimagnon Raman spectrum. Our calculation confirms the connection between
single-magnon rotonlike excitation energy and bimagnon Raman excitation
spectrum observed experimentally. The roton energy minimum in momentum space is
half of the energy of a bimagnon excitation signal. The experimental magnetic
Raman scattering result displays two peaks which have a Raman shift of 15 meV
and 40 meV, respectively. Theoretical modeling and analysis of the experimental
spectrum of alpha-SrCr2O4 within our distorted Heisenberg Hamiltonian lattice
suggests that the low-energy peak at 15 meV is associated with the bimagnon
excitation, whereas the high-energy peak around 40 meV is primarily a trimagnon
excitation. Based on our fitting procedure we propose a new set of magnetic
interaction parameters for alpha-SrCr2O4. These parameters reproduce not only
the experimental Raman spectrum, but also the inelastic neutron scattering
response (including capturing high energy magnon branches). We also compute the
unpolarized bimagnon and trimagnon Raman spectra for alpha-CaCr2O4.
Furhtermore, we found that the polarization sensitivity of Raman spectrum can
be utilized to distinguish the bi- and tri-magnon excitation channels.

<h3>Atomistic modeling of a superconductor-transition-metal  dichalcogenide-superconductor Josephson junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06645" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06645</a>
<br>
<i>Jouko Nieminen, Sayandip Dhara, Wei-Chi Chiu, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Arun Bansil</i>
<br>
<br>
Using an atomistic tight-binding model, we study the characteristics of a
Josephson junction formed by monolayers of MoS$_2$ sandwiched between Pb
superconducting electrodes. We derive and apply Green's function-based
formulation to compute the Josephson current in this system, as well as the
local density of states in the junction. Our analysis of diagonal and
off-diagonal components of the local density of states reveals the presence of
triplet superconducting correlations in the MoS$_2$ monolayers and
spin-polarized subgap (Andreev bound) states. Our formulation can be extended
to other systems where atomistic details and large scales are needed to obtain
accurate modeling of Josephson junction physics.

<h3>Berry curvature associated to Fermi arcs in continuum and lattice Weyl  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06678</a>
<br>
<i>Dennis Wawrzik, Jeroen van den Brink</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently it has been discovered that in Weyl semimetals the surface state
Berry curvature can diverge in certain regions of momentum. This occurs in a
continuum description of tilted Weyl cones, which for a slab geometry results
in the Berry curvature dipole associated to the surface Fermi arcs growing
linearly with slab thickness. Here we investigate analytically incarnations of
lattice Weyl semimetals and demonstrate this diverging surface Berry curvature
by solving for their surface states and connect these to their continuum
descriptions. We show how the shape of the Fermi arc and the Berry curvature
hot-line is determined and confirm the 1/k^2 divergence of the Berry curvature
at the end of the Fermi arc as well as the finite size effects for the Berry
curvature and its dipole, using finite slab calculations and surface Green's
function methods. We further establish that apart from affecting the second
order, non-linear Hall effect, the divergent Berry curvature has a strong
impact on other transport phenomena as the Magnus-Hall effect and the
non-linear chiral anomaly.

<h3>Current fluctuations in stochastically resetting particle systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06696</a>
<br>
<i>Costantino Di Bello, Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar, Francesco Mori, Alberto Rosso, Gregory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a system of non-interacting particles on a line with initial
positions distributed uniformly with density $\rho$ on the negative half-line.
We consider two different models: (i) each particle performs independent
Brownian motion with stochastic resetting to its initial position with rate $r$
and (ii) each particle performs run and tumble motion, and with rate $r$ its
position gets reset to its initial value and simultaneously its velocity gets
randomised. We study the effects of resetting on the distribution $P(Q,t)$ of
the integrated particle current $Q$ up to time $t$ through the origin (from
left to right). We study both the annealed and the quenched current
distributions and in both cases, we find that resetting induces a stationary
limiting distribution of the current at long times. However, we show that the
approach to the stationary state of the current distribution in the annealed
and the quenched cases are drastically different for both models. In the
annealed case, the whole distribution $P_{\rm an}(Q,t)$ approaches its
stationary limit uniformly for all $Q$. In contrast, the quenched distribution
$P_{\rm qu}(Q,t)$ attains its stationary form for $Q<Q_{\rm crit}(t)$, while it
remains time-dependent for $Q > Q_{\rm crit}(t)$. We show that $Q_{\rm
crit}(t)$ increases linearly with $t$ for large $t$. On the scale where $Q \sim
Q_{\rm crit}(t)$, we show that $P_{\rm qu}(Q,t)$ has an unusual large deviation
form with a rate function that has a third-order phase transition at the
critical point. We have computed the associated rate functions analytically for
both models. Using an importance sampling method that allows to probe
probabilities as tiny as $10^{-14000}$, we were able to compute numerically
this non-analytic rate function for the resetting Brownian dynamics and found
excellent agreement with our analytical prediction.

<h3>Nondestructive testing of high strength conductors for high field pulsed  magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06714</a>
<br>

High field pulsed magnets at the NHMFL use high strength conductor wires up
to 90% of their ultimate tensile strength. Therefore it is very important to
ensure that the wires are free of flaws. It is known that in the conductors
cold drawing process, internal chevron crack could occur due to unsuitable
drawing die schedule or inadequate lubrication. These internal cracks occurs
infrequently along the wire, so tensile tests of short samples cut from the
ends of a long length conductor often miss the problem. In addition, small
inclusions on the wire surface can compromise wires fatigue properties. In this
paper, we present results of our non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection of
Glidcop AL60 wires using eddy current testing (ECT), ultrasonic testing (UT)
and x-ray radiography (2D and 3D). Chevron cracks were found in some AL60
conductors by all three NDT techniques. Surface inclusions were found by ECT.
We have developed a long length ECT wire inspection capability.

<h3>Critical Current Longitudinal and Transverse Strain Sensitivities of  High JC Nb3Sn Conductors</h3>

Characterizing critical current IC of Nb3Sn strands as function of a strain
is very important for large high field superconducting magnet applications such
as the superconducting outsert coil of the series-connected hybrid at the NHMFL
and the ITER magnets. Apparatuses for measuring IC versus longitudinal strain
and transverse stress have been developed and used at the NHMFL. We have
characterized the IC strain sensitivities of a few candidate strands for the
series-connected-hybrid. In addition, IC irreversibility strains are measured
for the recently developed ITER high JC strands. The different strain
sensitivities for different strands are discussed.

<h3>Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in epitaxial W/Co/Pt  multilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) manifesting in asymmetric layered
ferromagnetic films gives rise to non-colinear spin structures stabilizing
magnetization configurations with nontrivial topology. In this work
magnetization reversal, domain structure, and strength of DMI are related with
the structure of W/Co/Pt multilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Applied
growth method enables fabrication of layered systems with higher crystalline
quality than commonly applied sputtering techniques. As a result, a high value
of D coefficient was determined from the aligned magnetic domain stripe
structure, substantially exceeding 2 mJ/m2. The highest value of DMI value
D$_{eff}$ = 2.64mj/m2 and strength of surface DMI parameter DS = 1.83pJ/m for
N=10 has been observed. Experimental results coincide precisely with those
obtained from structure based micromagnetic modelling and density functional
theory calculations performed for well-defined layered stacks. This high value
of DMI strength originates from dominating contributions of the interfacial
atomic Co layers and additive character from both interface types.

<h3>Entanglement Entropy in Ground States of Long-Range Fermionic Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06743</a>
<br>
<i>Debarghya Chakraborty, Nikolaos Angelinos</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the scaling of ground state entanglement entropy of various free
fermionic models on one dimensional lattices where the hopping and pairing
terms decay as a power law. We seek to understand the scaling of entanglement
entropy in generic models as the exponent of the power law $\alpha$ is varied.
We ask if there exists a common $\alpha_{c}$ across different systems governing
the transition to the area law scaling found in local systems. We explore
several examples numerically and argue that when applicable, the scaling of
entanglement entropy in long-range models is constrained by predictions from
low-energy theory. In contrast, disordered models and models without a
continuum limit show fractal scaling of entanglement approaching volume-law
behavior as $\alpha$ approaches zero. We find $\alpha_{c}$ to be non-universal.
These general features are expected to persist on turning on interactions.

<h3>ab-plane tilt angles in REBCO conductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06753" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06753</a>
<br>
<i>Jun Lu, Yan Xin, Yifei Zhang, Hongyu Bai</i>
<br>
<br>
Critical current (Ic) of REBCO tapes is strongly aniso-tropic with respect to
the orientation of the magnetic field. Usually, Ic is at maximum when the
ab-plane of the REBCO crystal is parallel to the magnetic field. In commercial
REBCO tapes, it is commonly assumed that the ab-plane is coincide with the tape
plane. While in fact, the ab-plane is near but slightly tilted from the tape
plane in the transverse direction. To accurately measure Ic as a function of
the field angle {\theta} , which is defined as the angle between ab-plane and
the magnetic field direction, and to design and fabricate REBCO mag-net coils
based on the measured Ic(angle), it is important to measure the tilt angle. In
this work, we used x-ray diffraction (XRD) to measure the tilt angles at room
temperature for a large number of REBCO conductors made by SuperPower Inc.
Transmission electron mi-croscopy (TEM) was also used to investigate the origin
of this tilt. The measured data are presented, and the measurement uncer-tainty
is discussed.

<h3>Effects of Wax Impregnation on Contact Resistivity Between REBCO Tapes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06756" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06756</a>
<br>
<i>Jeremy W. Levitan, Jun Lu, Brent Jarvis, Hongyu Bai</i>
<br>
<br>
Advances on no-insulation REBCO coil technology has made understanding and
controlling contact resistivity increasingly im-portant. Praffin (wax)
impregnation is a process that has been used for improving mechanical stability
of insulated and no-insulation REBCO coils. Wax impregnation is beneficial in
both no-insulation coils and insulated coils with additional copper sta-bilizer
or multiple conductors. In the latter scenario, contact re-sistance between
conductor and additional stabilizer is also im-portant. It is crucial to
understand the effects of wax impregna-tion on contact resistivity (Rct). We
designed and built an appa-ratus to use short REBCO samples which simulates the
behavior of Rct in a pancake coil during the wax impregnation process. Rct was
measured at 77 K before and after the wax impregnation. In addition, a single
pancake coil was wound to test the effect of wax impregnation. This coil
simulates the NHMFL 32 T magnet Coil A in winding stresses. Rct was measured at
77 K and 4.2 K before and after wax impregnation. We found that wax
impregnation does not significantly change contact resistivity. This means that
wax impregnation can be used in coils without compromising the current sharing
ability between turns. The experimental process and results are discussed.

Solid ionic conductors are essential components of batteries and fuel cells.
In many cases, ionic conduction through crystalline materials with
substitutional disorder can be modeled with atomic-scale lattice model
percolation simulations. The ionic percolation theory reviewed in this chapter
describes the percolation behavior of diffusion pathways, identifies the
fraction of lattice sites that contributes to ionic conduction, and quantifies
the tortuosity of diffusion networks. These quantities can be related to the
bulk diffusivity and capacity of intercalation battery electrodes. We discuss
applications to lithium-ion battery cathodes in the disordered rocksalt and
related crystal structures, showing how the diffusion pathways and their
tortuosity vary with the Li content short-range order. All examples are based
on the free and open-source Dribble simulation software.

Recent experimental progress has established the twisted bilayer transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD) as a highly tunable platform for studying many-body
physics. Particularly, the homobilayer TMD under displacement field is believed
to be described by a generalized triangular-lattice Hubbard model with a
spin-dependent hopping phase $\theta$. To explore the effects of $\theta$ on
the system state, we perform density matrix renormalization group calculations
for the relevant triangular lattice t-J model. By changing $\theta$ at small
hole doping, we obtain a region of quasi-long-range superconducting order
coexisting with charge and spin density wave in $0<\theta<\pi/3$. The
superconductivity is composed of a dominant spin singlet d-wave and a
subdominant triplet p-wave pairing. Intriguingly, the $S_z=\pm 1$ triplet
pairing components feature pair density waves. In addition, we find a region of
triplet superconductivity coexisting with charge density wave and
ferromagnetism in $\pi/3<\theta<2\pi/3$, which on close inspection is
conjugated to the former phase at smaller $\theta$ by a combined operation of
spin-flip and gauge transformation. Our findings provide insights and direction
for experimental search for exotic superconductivity in twisted TMD systems.

In this work, ~100 nm wide quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI)
nanoribbons are etched from a two-dimensional QAHI film. One part of the
nanoribbon is covered with superconducting Nb, while the other part is
connected to an Au lead via two-dimensional QAHI regions. Andreev reflection
spectroscopy measurements were performed, and multiple in-gap conductance peaks
were observed in three different devices. In the presence of an increasing
magnetic field perpendicular to the QAHI film, the multiple in-gap peak
structure evolves into a single zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). Theoretical
simulations suggest that the measurements are consistent with the scenario that
the increasing magnetic field drives the nanoribbons from a multi-channel
occupied regime to a single channel occupied regime, and that the ZBCP may be
induced by zero energy Majorana modes as previously predicted [24]. Although
further experiments are needed to clarify the nature of the ZBCP, we provide
initial evidence that quasi-1D QAHI nanoribbon/superconductor heterostructures
are new and promising platforms for realizing zero-energy Majorana modes.

Computational modeling of high entropy alloys (HEA) is challenging given the
scalability issues of Density functional theory (DFT) and the non-availability
of Interatomic potentials (IP) for molecular dynamics simulations (MD). This
work presents a computationally efficient IP for modeling complex elemental
interactions present in HEAs. The proposed random features-based IP can
accurately model melting behaviour along with various process-related defects.
The disordering of atoms during the melting process was simulated. Predicted
atomic forces are within 0.08 eV/$\unicode{xC5}$ of corresponding DFT forces.
MD simulations predictions of mechanical and thermal properties are within
7$\%$ of the DFT values. High-temperature self-diffusion in the alloy system
was investigated using the IP. A novel sparse model is also proposed which
reduces the computational cost by 94$\%$ without compromising on the force
prediction accuracy.

At the ultra-thin limit below 20 nm, a film's electrical conductivity,
thermal conductivity, or thermoelectricity depends heavily on its thickness. In
most studies, each sample is fabricated one at a time, potentially leading to
considerable uncertainty in later characterizations. We design and build an
in-situ apparatus to measure thermoelectricity during their deposition inside a
thermal evaporator. A temperature difference of up to 2 K is generated by a
current passing through an on-chip resistor patterned using photolithography.
The Seebeck voltage is measured on a Hall bar structure of a film deposited
through a shadow mask. The measurement system is calibrated carefully before
loading into the thermal evaporator. This in-situ thermoelectricity measurement
system has been thoroughly tested on various materials, including Bi, Te, and
Bi$_2$Te$_3$, at high temperatures up to 500 K.

<br>
<br>
Partial synchronization is characteristic phase dynamics of coupled
oscillators on various natural and artificial networks, which can remain
undetected due to the complexity of the systems. With an analogy between
pairwise asynchrony of oscillators and topological defects, i.e., vortices, in
the two-dimensional XY spin model, we propose a robust and data-driven method
to identify the partial synchronization on complex networks. The proposed
method is based on an integer matrix whose element is pseudo-vorticity that
discretely quantifies asynchronous phase dynamics in every two oscillators,
which results in graphical and entropic representations of partial synchrony.
As a first trial, we apply our method to 200 FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons on a
complex small-world network. Partially synchronized chimera states are revealed
by discriminating synchronized states even with phase lags. Such phase lags
also appear in partial synchronization in chimera states. Our topological,
graphical, and entropic method is implemented solely with measurable phase
dynamics data, which will lead to a straightforward application to general
oscillatory networks including neural networks in the brain.

We address amorphization of montmorillonite crystal structure. Powdered
montmorillonite samples with an effective particle diameter 630 micrometers
were treated by a microwave field with frequency 2,45 GHz and power 750 W for
ten minutes in different environments. The first sample was treated in an air
environment, the second one in a humid environment. The third sample was a
ceramic mass with 10 percent concentration of mixing water (with respect to the
total mass). The model describing amorphization is based on results of X-ray
analysis. Activation energies were evaluated for covalent and ionic bounds of
oxygen ions, hydroxyl groups, and silicon (aluminum) ions. It is shown that the
amorphization is carried out in four stages. In fractions of the energy
consumption of the last stage the first one consumes 7-9 percent, the second
one takes 13-15 percent, and the third one takes 49-59 percent.

simple metals was investigated through density functional theory methods. The
phonon dispersion curves were systematically computed for the clathrate
structures containing the guest dopants (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, Al, Ga, Ge) in
one of the two distinct cages, fullerene-like C60 and sodalite-like C24,
exhibited by this structure. Only four of these structures, Li@C24, Na@C24,
Ga@C24 and Be@C60, are dynamically stable in the harmonic approximation. They
all show superconducting behavior, although their critical temperatures are
predicted to be below 2 K.

Several dimerization products of fullerene C60 are presented and thoroughly
characterized with a quantum chemical DFT model augmented by dispersion. We
reanalyze and expand significantly the number of known dimers from 12 to 41.
Many of the novel bonding schemes were found by analyzing more than 2
nanoseconds of high energy molecular dynamics semiempirical trajectories with
AutoMeKin, a methodology previously used to compute the reactivity of much
smaller molecules. For completeness, this was supplemented by structures built
by different geometric considerations. Also, spin-polarization was explicitly
considered yielding 12 new bonding schemes with magnetic ground states. The
results are comprehensively analyzed and discussed in the context of yet to be
explained 3D fullerene structures and recent fullerene 2D systems.

Classical percolation theory underlies many processes of information transfer
along the links of a network. In these standard situations, the requirement for
two nodes to be able to communicate is the presence of at least one
uninterrupted path of nodes between them. In a variety of more recent data
transmission protocols, such as the communication of noisy data via
error-correcting repeaters, both in classical and quantum networks, the
requirement of an uninterrupted path is too strict: two nodes may be able to
communicate even if all paths between them have interruptions/gaps consisting
of nodes that may corrupt the message. In such a case a different approach is
needed. We develop the theoretical framework for extended-range percolation in
networks, describing the fundamental connectivity properties relevant to such
models of information transfer. We obtain exact results, for any range $d$, for
infinite random uncorrelated networks and we provide a message-passing
formulation that works well in sparse real-world networks. The interplay of the
extended range and heterogeneity leads to novel critical behavior in scale-free
networks.

We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC)
simulations of the harmonically perturbed uniform electron gas (UEG) for
different densities and temperatures. This allows us to study the linear
response of the UEG with respect to different contributions to the total energy
for different wave numbers. We find that the induced change in the interaction
energy exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour, and becomes negative for
intermediate wave numbers. This effect is strongly dependent on the coupling
strength and can be traced back to the spatial alignment of electrons
introduced in earlier works [T.~Dornheim \emph{et al.}, Communications Physics
\textbf{5}, 304 (2022)]. The observed quadratic dependence on the perturbation
amplitude in the limit of weak perturbations and the quartic dependence of the
perturbation amplitude corrections are consistent with linear and non-linear
versions of the density stifness theorem. All PIMC simulation results are
freely available online and can be used to benchmark new methods, or as input
for other calculations.

Weak bond disorder disrupts the expected spin-liquid ground-state of the
ideal $S$ = 1/2 Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet. Here we introduce a
single crystal study of the structural and magnetic properties of the
bond-disordered pyrochlore NaCdCo$_2$F$_7$. The magnetic susceptibility appears
isotropic, with a large negative Curie-Weiss temperature ($\theta_{CW}$ =
-108(1) K), however no magnetic order is observed on cooling until a spin-glass
transition at $T_f$ = 4.0 K. AC-susceptibility measurements show a
frequency-dependent shift of the associated cusp in $\chi$ at $T_f$, that can
be fitted well by the empirical Vogel-Fulcher law. The magnetic moment of
$\mu_{eff}$ = 5.4(1) $\mu_{B}$/Co$^{2+}$ indicates a significant orbital
contribution and heat capacity measurements show that down to 1.8 K, well below
$T_f$, only $S_{mag}$ ~2/3 Rln(2) of the magnetic entropy is recovered,
suggestive of residual continued dynamics. Structural and magnetism comparisons
are made with the other known members of the Na$A$Co$_2$F$_7$ family ($A$ =
Ca$^{2+}$, Sr$^{2+}$), confirming the expected relationship between spin-glass
freezing temperature, and extent of magnetic bond disorder brought about by the
size mismatch between A-site ions.

We propose a model to simulate different traffic-flow conditions in terms of

keep track of the type and of the destination of each vehicle. The traffic flow
inside the system is encoded in a proper set of Lindbladian local dissipators
that describe the time evolution of the system density matrix. Taking advantage
of the invariance of the Lindblad master equation under inhomogeneous
transformations we derive the quantum Hamiltonian for the bulk dynamics in a
proper experimental setup.

The characterization of the distance from equilibrium is a debated problem in
particular in the treatment of experimental signals. If the signal is a
1-dimensional time-series, such a goal becomes challenging. A paradigmatic
example is the angular diffusion of a rotator immersed in a vibro-fluidized
granular gas. Here, we experimentally observe that the rotator's angular
velocity exhibits significative differences with respect to an equilibrium
process. Exploiting the presence of two relevant time-scales and non-Gaussian
velocity increments, we quantify the breakdown of time-reversal asymmetry,
which would vanish in the case of a 1d Gaussian process. We deduce a new model
for the massive probe, with two linearly coupled variables, incorporating both
Gaussian and Poissonian noise, the latter motivated by the rarefied collisions
with the granular bath particles. Our model reproduces the experiment in a
range of densities, from dilute to moderately dense, with a meaningful
dependence of the parameters on the density.

Materials with an irreversible response to cyclic driving exhibit an evolving
internal state which, in principle, encodes information on the driving history.
Here we realize irreversible metamaterials that count mechanical driving cycles
and store the result into easily interpretable internal states. We extend these
designs to aperiodic metamaterials which are sensitive to the order of
different driving magnitudes, and realize 'lock and key' metamaterials that
only reach a specific state for a given target driving sequence. Our strategy
is robust, scalable and extendable, and opens new routes towards smart sensing,
soft robotics and mechanical information processing.

<h3>Origin of the large differences in high-pressure stability and  superconductivity between ThH9 and ThH18</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, the thorium hydride ThH9 possessing an H-rich clathrate structure
has been experimentally synthesized to exhibit a superconducting transition
temperature Tc of 146 K at 170-175 GPa, while the more H-rich clathrate thorium
hydride ThH18 was theoretically predicted to reach a Tc of 296 K at 400 GPa.
Using first-principles calculations, we find that ThH9 has a more ionic
character between Th atoms and H cages than ThH18 and that the latter has a
more substantial hybridization of the Th 6p semicore and H 1s states than the
former. These different bonding characteristics of ThH9 and ThH18 are
associated with their stability at very different pressures. Furthermore, we
reveal that (i) the H-derived density of states at the Fermi level Ef is about
two times larger in ThH18 than in ThH9. (ii) the average squared phonon
frequency of H atoms is about 29% higher in ThH18 than in ThH9, and (iii) the
Fermi surface average squared electron-phonon matrix element is similar between
the two hydrides. Consequently, the electron-phonon coupling constant of ThH18
becomes much greater than that of ThH9, leading to a significant Tc difference
between the two thorium hydrides. Our findings not only provide an explanation
for the very large differences in the stabilization pressure and
superconducting transition temperature between ThH9 and ThH18 but also have
important implications for the design of H-rich, high-Tc clathrate metal
hydrides.

This paper investigates generalized thermodynamic relationships in physical
systems where relevant macroscopic variables are determined by the exponential
Kolmogorov-Nagumo average. We show that while the thermodynamic entropy of such
systems is naturally described by R\'{e}nyi's entropy with parameter $\gamma$,
their statistics under equilibrium thermodynamics are still described by an
ordinary Boltzmann distribution, which can be interpreted as a system with
inverse temperature $\beta$ quenched to another heat bath with inverse
temperature $\beta' = (1-\gamma)\beta$. For the non-equilibrium case, we show
how the dynamics of systems described by exponential Kolmogorov-Nagumo averages
still observe a second law of thermodynamics and H-theorem. We further discuss
the applications of stochastic thermodynamics in those systems - namely, the
validity of fluctuation theorems - and the connection with thermodynamic
length.

Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets represent one of the most
promising horizons for energy-efficient spintronic applications because their
broad range of electronic, magnetic and topological properties. Of particular
interest is the control of the magnetic properties of 2D materials by
femtosecond laser pulses which can provide a real path for low-power
consumption device platforms in data storage industries. However, little is
known about the interplay between light and spin properties in vdW layers.
Here, combining large-scale spin dynamics simulations including biquadratic
exchange interactions and wide-field Kerr microscopy (WFKM), we show that
ultrafast laser excitation can not only generate different type of spin
textures in CrGeTe$_3$ vdW magnets but also induce a reversible transformation
between them in a toggle-switch mechanism. Our calculations show that
skyrmions, anti-skyrmions, skyrmioniums and stripe domains can be generated via
high-intense laser pulses within the picosecond regime. The effect is tunable
with the laser energy where different spin behaviours can be selected, such as
fast demagnetisation process ($\sim$250 fs) important for information
technologies. The phase transformation between the different topological spin
textures is obtained as additional laser pulses are applied to the system where
the polarisation and final state of the spins can be controlled by external
magnetic fields. We experimentally confirmed the creation, manipulation and
toggle switching phenomena in CrGeTe$_3$ due to the unique aspect of
laser-induced heating of electrons. Our results indicate laser-driven spin
textures on 2D magnets as a pathway towards ultrafast reconfigurable
architecture at the atomistic level.

<br>
<br>
Solid-state methods for cooling and heating promise a more sustainable
alternative to current compression cycles of greenhouse gases and inefficient
fuel-burning heaters. Barocaloric effects (BCE) driven by hydrostatic pressure
($p$) are especially encouraging in terms of large adiabatic temperature
changes ($|\Delta T| \sim 10$ K) and colossal isothermal entropy changes
($|\Delta S| \sim 100$ JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$). However, BCE typically require
large pressure shifts due to irreversibility issues, and sizeable $|\Delta T|$
and $|\Delta S|$ seldom are realized in a same material. Here, we demonstrate
the existence of colossal and reversible BCE in LiCB$_{11}$H$_{12}$, a
well-known solid electrolyte, near its order-disorder phase transition at
$\approx 380$ K. Specifically, for $\Delta p \approx 0.23$ $(0.10)$ GPa we
measured $|\Delta S_{\rm rev}| = 280$ $(200)$ JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$ and $|\Delta
T_{\rm rev}| = 32$ $(10)$ K, which individually rival with state-of-the-art
barocaloric shifts obtained under similar pressure conditions. Furthermore,
over a wide temperature range, pressure shifts of the order of $0.1$ GPa yield
huge reversible barocaloric strengths of $\approx 2$
JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$MPa$^{-1}$. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out
to quantify the role of lattice vibrations, molecular reorientations and ion
diffusion on the disclosed colossal BCE. Interestingly, lattice vibrations were
found to contribute the most to $|\Delta S|$ while the diffusion of lithium
ions, despite adding up only slightly to the accompanying entropy change, was
crucial in enabling the molecular order-disorder phase transition. Our work
expands the knowledge on plastic crystals and should motivate the investigation
of BCE in a variety of solid electrolytes displaying ion diffusion and
concomitant molecular orientational disorder.

Located at crystal voids, interstitial anion electrons (IAEs) have diverse
topologies, which may be tuned to achieve new properties. Elucidating the role
of IAEs in electron-phonon coupling (EPC), and using it to design new electride
superconductors, leads to the current prediction of superconducting Li8Au at
high pressure. We suggest that the occurence of high-temperature
superconductivity in electrides requires high-symmetry structures with
hydrogen-like cages, an electron acceptor element to balance charges, and
isolated IAEs coupled with medium-frequency vibrations. The uniquely designed
Li8Au electride has a NaCl-type (B1) lattice, with atomic Au and cubic Li8
cages as bases. Isolated IAEs are formed at the cage centers, with extra
charges taken up by Au. These octahedrally coordinated IAEs have a
p-orbital-like attribute and are strongly coupled with atomic vibrations in the
Li8 cages. The strong EPC in Li8Au results in a calculated Tc of 73.1 K at 250
GPa, which is the highest Tc reported to date for all the electrides. A slight
substitutional Pt doping can enhance the Tc of Li8Au to exceed liquid nitrogen
temperature.

We report neutron scattering measurements on YbMnSb$_2$ which shed new light
on the nature of the magnetic moments and their interaction with Dirac
fermions. Using half-polarized neutron diffraction we measured the
field-induced magnetization distribution in the paramagnetic phase and found
that the magnetic moments are well localised on the Mn atoms. Using triple-axis
neutron scattering we measured the magnon spectrum throughout the Brillouin
zone in the antiferromagnetically ordered phase, and we determined the dominant
exchange interactions from linear spin-wave theory. The analysis shows that the
interlayer exchange is five times larger than in several related compounds
containing Bi instead of Sb. We argue that the coupling between the Mn local
magnetic moments and the topological band states is more important in
YbMnSb$_2$ than in the Bi compounds.

uniaxial stress in the CuO_2 plane. A sixfold increase of the 3-dimensional
(3D) superconducting critical temperature T_c and a full recovery of the 3D
phase coherence is observed in both samples with the application of extremely
low uniaxial stress of 0.1 GPa. This finding demonstrates the removal of the
well-known 1/8-anomaly of cuprates by uniaxial stress. On the other hand, the
spin-stripe order temperature as well as the magnetic fraction at 400 mK show
only a modest decrease under stress. Moreover, the onset temperatures of 3D
superconductivity and spin-stripe order are very similar in the large stress
regime. However, a substantial decrease of the magnetic volume fraction and a
full suppression of the low-temperature tetragonal structure is found at
elevated temperatures, which is a necessary condition for the development of
the 3D superconducting phase with optimal T_c. Our results evidence a
remarkable cooperation between the long-range static spin-stripe order and the
underlying crystalline order with the three-dimensional fully coherent
superconductivity. Overall, these results suggest that the stripe- and the SC
order may have a common physical mechanism.

Here, we report on the characterization of {CdO/ZnO}m superlattice structures
(SLs) grown by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The properties of
as-grown and annealed SLs deposited on m-oriented sapphire were investigated by
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
in cathodoluminescence (CL) and energy dispersive X-ray modes. The deformation
of the crystallographic structure of SLs was observed after rapid thermal
annealing at 900{\deg}C in oxygen flow due to migration and segregation of Cd
atoms. SIMS measurements revealed that the distributions of cadmium in the
annealed samples depend on the thicknesses of the CdO and ZnO sublayers in the
as grown superlattice structures. Depth-resolved CL measurements showed that
shifting of the near band edge emission peaks is closely related to the Cd
profiles measured with SIMS.

<h3>Geometry-independent tight-binding method for massless Dirac fermions in  two dimensions</h3>

The Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, dubbed `fermion-doubling', poses a problem for
the naive discretization of a single (massless) Dirac cone on a two-dimensional
surface. The inevitable appearance of an additional, unphysical fermionic mode
can, for example, be circumvented by introducing an extra dimension to
spatially separate Dirac cones. In this work, we propose a geometry-independent
protocol based on a tight-binding model for a three-dimensional topological
insulator on a cubic lattice. The low-energy theory, below the bulk gap,
corresponds to a Dirac cone on its two-dimensional surface which can have an
arbitrary geometry. We introduce a method where only a thin shell of the
topological insulator needs to be simulated. Depending on the setup, we propose
to gap out the states on the undesired surfaces either by breaking the
time-reversal symmetry or by introducing a superconducting pairing. We show
that it is enough to have a thickness of the topological-insulator shell of
three to nine lattice constants. This leads to an effectively two-dimensional
scaling with minimal and fixed shell thickness. We test the idea by comparing
the spectrum and probability distribution to analytical results for both a
proximitized Dirac mode and a Dirac mode on a sphere which exhibits a
nontrivial spin-connection. The protocol yields a tight-binding model on a
cubic lattice simulating Dirac cones on arbitrary surfaces with only a small
overhead due to the finite thickness of the shell.

Unlike other II-VI semiconductors, CdO-based transparent oxide has great
potential application for the fabrication of many optoelectronic devices. In
this work, we study the growth of CdxMg1-xO alloys on m- and on c-plane
sapphire substrates in Cd-rich to Mg-rich conditions using the plasma-assisted
molecular beam epitaxy method. A structural and morphological study of CdMgO
random alloys was carried out using X-ray diffraction and Atomic Force
Microscope (AFM) techniques whereas composition analysis was done by
Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy method. The optical properties of
thin films were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy at room temperature. X-ray
analysis confirmed the presence of cubic rock salt structure with <111> CdMgO
crystallographic orientation on c-plane sapphire and <110> CdMgO preferential
orientation on m-plane sapphire. The surface roughness was measured by the AFM.
From the absorption curve, the optical bandgaps were determined using Tauc
relation and it was found that the bandgap of films is influenced by the
incorporation of Mg2+ ions into the CdO lattice. Bowing parameter was
calculated both for samples on m- and c- sapphires.

<h3>Doubly stochastic continuous time random walk</h3>

Since its introduction, some sixty years ago, the Montroll-Weiss continuous
time random walk has found numerous applications due its ease of use and
ability to describe both regular and anomalous diffusion. Yet, despite its
broad applicability and generality, the model cannot account for effects coming
from random diffusivity fluctuations which have been observed in the motion of
asset prices and molecules. To bridge this gap, we introduce a doubly
stochastic version of the model in which waiting times between jumps are
replaced with a fluctuating jump rate. We show that this newly added layer of
randomness gives rise to a rich phenomenology while keeping the model fully
tractable - allowing us to explore general properties and illustrate them with
examples. In particular, we show that the model presented herein provides an
alternative pathway to Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion which has been
observed and explained via diffusing diffusivity approaches.

<br>
Moir\'e trapped interlayer excitons (IXs) in heterobilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides currently attract strong interest due to their potential for
non-classical light generation, coherent spin-photon interfaces and exploring
novel correlated phases of electrons. Here, we report lasing of moir\'e trapped
IXs by integrating a pristine hBN-encapsulated MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer
in a high-Q ($>10^4$) nanophotonic cavity. We control the detuning between the
IX line and the cavity mode with a magnetic field and measure the dipolar
coupling strength to the cavity mode to be $78 \pm 4\ \mathrm{\mu eV}$, fully
consistent with the 82 $\mathrm{\mu eV}$ predicted by theory. The emission from
the cavity mode shows clear threshold-like behaviour. We observe a superlinear
power dependence accompanied by a narrowing of the linewidth as the distinct
features of lasing. The onset and prominence of these threshold-like behaviours
are significant at resonance whilst weak off-resonance. Our results show that a
lasing transition can be induced in interacting moir\'e trapped IXs with
macroscopic coherence extending over the lengthscale of the cavity mode. Such
systems raise interesting perspectives for low-power switching and synaptic
nanophotonic devices using 2D materials.

<br>
<br>
We present a unified treatment of the Aharonov--Bohm (AB) effect for
two-dimensional multiband electronic systems possessing isotropic band
structures. We propose an integral representation of the AB scattering state of
an electron scattered by an infinitely thin solenoid. Moreover, we derive the
asymptotic form of the AB scattering state and obtain the differential cross
section from that. We found a remarkable result, namely that this cross section
is {\it the same for all isotropic systems} and agrees with that obtained first
by Aharonov and Bohm for spinless free particle systems. To demonstrate the
generality of our theory, we consider several specific multiband systems
relevant to condensed matter physics.

Coulomb drag experiments can give us information about the interaction state
of double-layer systems. Here, we demonstrate anomalous Coulomb drag behaviours
in a two-dimensional electron-electron bilayer system constructed by stacking
atomically thin MoS2 on opposite sides of thin dielectric layers of boron
nitride. In the low temperature regime, the measured drag resistance does not
follow the behaviour predicted by the Coulomb drag models of exchanging momenta
and energies with the particles in Fermi-liquid bilayer systems. Instead, it
shows an upturn to higher and higher values. We investigate quantum solid/fluid
phases and the Kosterlitz-Thouless/Wigner two-dimensional quantum melting
transition in this bilayer system and describe this interesting phenomenon
based on thermally activated carriers of quantum defects from the formation of
the correlation-induced electron solid phases with enhanced stabilization by
the potential due to the boron nitride dielectric layers.

<h3>Laplacian Coarse Graining in Complex Networks</h3>

Complex networks can model a range of different systems, from the human brain
to social connections. Some of those networks have a large number of nodes and
links, making it impractical to analyze them directly. One strategy to simplify
these systems is by creating miniaturized versions of the networks that keep
their main properties. A convenient tool that applies that strategy is the
renormalization group (RG), a methodology used in statistical physics to change
the scales of physical systems. This method consists of two steps: a coarse
grain, where one reduces the size of the system, and a rescaling of the
interactions to compensate for the information loss. This work applies RG to
complex networks by introducing a coarse-graining method based on the Laplacian
matrix. We use a field-theoretical approach to calculate the correlation
function and coarse-grain the most correlated nodes into super-nodes, applying
our method to several artificial and real-world networks. The results are
promising, with most of the networks under analysis showing self-similar
properties across different scales.

<h3>Andreev reflection in Euler materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Arthur S. Morris, Adrien Bouhon, Robert-Jan Slager</i>
<br>
<br>
Many previous studies of Andreev reflection have demonstrated that unusual
effects can occur in media which have a nontrivial bulk topology. Following
this line of investigation, we study Andreev reflection in topological Euler
materials by analysing a simple model of a bulk node with a generic winding
number $n\geq 0$. We find that the magnitudes of the resultant reflection
coefficients depend strongly on whether the winding is even or odd. Moreover
this parity dependence is reflected in the differential conductance curves,
which are highly suppressed for $n$ even but not $n$ odd. This gives a possible
route through which the recently discovered Euler topology could be probed
experimentally.

<h3>End-Tethered Chains Increase the Local Glass Transition Temperature of  Matrix Chains by 45 K Next to Solid Substrates Independent of Chain Length</h3>

<br>
<br>
The local glass transition temperature Tg of pyrene-labeled polystyrene (PS)
chains intermixed with end-tethered PS chains grafted to a neutral silica
substrate was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. To isolate the impact of
the grafted chains, the films were capped with bulk neat PS layers eliminating
competing effects of the free surface. Results demonstrate that end-grafted
chains strongly increase the local Tg of matrix chains by $\approx$45 K
relative to bulk Tg, independent of grafted chain molecular weight from Mn =
8.6 to 212 kg/mol and chemical end-group, over a wide range of grafting
densities $\sigma$ = 0.003 to 0.33 chains/nm$^2$ spanning the mushroom-to-brush
transition regime. The tens-of-degree increase in local Tg resulting from
immobilization of the chain ends by covalent bonding in this athermal system
suggests a mechanism that substantially increases the local activation energy
required for cooperative rearrangements.

Magnetic topological insulators, possessing both magnetic order and
topological electronic structure, provides an excellent platform to research
unusual physical properties. Here, we report a high-pressure study on the
anomalous Hall effect of magnetic TI MnSb4Te7 through transports measurements
combined with first-principle theoretical calculations. We discover that the
ground state of MnSb4Te7 experiences a magnetic phase transition from the
A-type antiferromagnetic state to ferromagnetic dominating state at 3.78 GPa,
although its crystal sustains a rhombohedral phase under high pressures up to 8
GPa. The anomalous Hall conductance {\sigma}xyA keeps around 10 {\Omega}-1
cm-1, dominated by the intrinsic mechanism even after the magnetic phase
transition. The results shed light on the intriguing magnetism in MnSb4Te7 and
pave the way for further studies of the relationship between topology and
magnetism in topological materials.

<h3>Phase Separation and Aggregation in Multiblock Chains</h3>

This article focuses on phase and aggregation behavior for linear chains
composed of blocks of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. Phase and
conformational transitions of patterned chains are relevant for understanding
liquid-liquid separation of biomolecular condensates, which play a prominent
role in cellular biophysics, but also for surfactant and polymer applications.
Previous studies of simple models for multiblock chains have shown that,
depending on the sequence pattern and chain length, such systems can fall into
one of two categories: displaying either phase separation or aggregation into
finite-size clusters. The key new result of the present study is that both
formation of finite-size aggregates and phase separation can be observed for
certain chain architectures at appropriate conditions of temperature and
concentration. For such systems, a bulk dense liquid condenses from a dilute
phase that already contains multi-chain finite-size aggregates. The
computational approach involves several distinct steps using
histogram-reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, which are
described here in some level of detail.

Band engineering is thoroughly employed nowadays targeting technologically
scalable photoanodes for solar water splitting applications. Most often complex
and costly recipes are necessary, for average performances. Here we report very
simple photoanode growth and thermal annealing, with effective band engineering
results. Strongly enhanced photocurrent, of more than 200 %, is measured for
Ti-doped hematite nanorods grown from aqueous solutions and annealed under
Nitrogen atmosphere, compared to air annealed ones. Oxidized surface states and
increased density of charge carriers are found responsible for the enhanced
photoelectrochemical activity, as shown by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy and synchrotron X-rays spectromicroscopies. They are found related
to oxygen vacancies, acting as n-dopants, and the formation of pseudo- brookite
clusters by surface Ti segregation. Spectro-ptychography is used for the first
time at Ti L3 absorption edge to isolate Ti chemical coordination arising from
pseudo-brookite clusters contribution. Correlated with electron microscopy
investigation and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, our data
unambiguously prove the origin of the enhanced photoelectrochemical activity of
N2-annealed Ti-doped hematite nanorods. Finally, we present here a handy and
cheap surface engineering method beyond the known oxygen vacancy doping,
allowing a net gain in the photoelectrochemical activity for the hematite-based
photoanodes.

<br>
Geopolymer has been considered as a green and low-carbon material with great
potential application due to its simple synthesis process, environmental
protection, excellent mechanical properties, good chemical resistance and
durability. In this work, the molecular dynamics simulation is employed to
investigate the effect of the size, content and distribution of carbon
nanotubes on the thermal conductivity of geopolymer nanocomposites, and the
microscopic mechanism is analyzed by the phonon density of states, phonon
participation ratio and spectral thermal conductivity, etc. The results show
that there is a significant size effect in geopolymer nanocomposites system due
to the carbon nanotubes. In addition, when the content of carbon nanotubes is
16.5%, the thermal conductivity in carbon nanotubes vertical axial direction
(4.85 W/(mk)) increases 125.6% compared with the system without carbon
nanotubes (2.15 W/(mk)). However, the thermal conductivity in carbon nanotubes
vertical axial direction (1.25 W/(mk)) decreases 41.9%, which is mainly due to
the interfacial thermal resistance and phonon scattering at the interfaces. The
above results provide theoretical guidance for the tunable thermal conductivity
in carbon nanotube-geopolymer nanocomposites.

The flat band is a key ingredient for the realization of interesting quantum
states for novel functionalities. In this work, we investigate the conditions
for the flat band in both monolayer and bilayer graphene under periodic strain.
We find topological nearly flat bands with homogeneous distribution of Berry
curvature in both systems. The quantum metric of the nearly flat band closely
resembles that for Landau levels. For monolayer graphene, the strain field can
be regarded as an effective gauge field, while for Bernal-stacked (AB-stacked)
bilayer graphene, its role is beyond the description of gauge field. We also
provide an understanding of the origin of the nearly flat band in monolayer
graphene in terms of the Jackiw-Rebbi model for Dirac fermions with
sign-changing mass. Our work suggests strained graphene as a promising platform
for strongly correlated quantum states.

<br>
<br>
Atomic physics has greatly advanced quantum science, mainly due to the
ability to control the position and internal quantum state of atoms with high
precision, often at the quantum limit. The dominant tool for this is laser
light, which can structure and localize atoms in space (e.g., in optical
tweezers, optical lattices, 1D tubes or 2D planes). Due to the diffraction
limit of light, the natural length scale for most experiments with atoms is on
the order of 500 nm or larger. Here we implement a new super-resolution
technique which localizes and arranges atoms on a sub-50 nm scale, without any
fundamental limit in resolution. We demonstrate this technique by creating a
bilayer of dysprosium atoms, mapping out the atomic density distribution with
sub-10 nm resolution, and observing dipolar interactions between two physically
separated layers via interlayer sympathetic cooling and coupled collective
excitations. At 50 nm, dipolar interactions are 1,000 times stronger than at
500 nm. For two atoms in optical tweezers, this should enable purely magnetic
dipolar gates with kHz speed.

We construct families of exotic spin-1/2 chains using a procedure called
``hard rod deformation''. We treat both integrable and non-integrable examples.
The models possess a large non-commutative symmetry algebra, which is generated
by matrix product operators with fixed small bond dimension. The symmetries
lead to Hilbert space fragmentation and to the breakdown of thermalization. As
an effect, the models support persistent oscillations in non-equilibrium
situations. Similar symmetries have been reported earlier in integrable models,
but here we show that they also occur in non-integrable cases.

We report a comprehensive spin wave analysis of the semiconducting honeycomb
van der Waal antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Using single crystal inelastic neutron
scattering, we map out the full Brillouin zone and fit the observed modes to a
spin wave model with rigorously defined uncertainty. We find that the third
neighbor exchange $J_3$ dominates the Hamiltonian, a feature which we fully
account for by ab-initio density functional theory calculations. We also
quantify the degree to which the three-fold rotation symmetry is broken and
account for the $Q=0$ excitations observed in other measurements, yielding a
spin exchange model which is consistent across multiple experimental probes. We
also identify a strongly reduced static ordered moment and reduced low-energy
intensity relative to the linear spin wave calculations, signaling unexplained
features in the magnetism which requires going beyond the linear spin wave
approximation.

<h3>Flat-band energy analysis of the temperature-dependent superconducting  gap for hydrogenated graphite fibers found from nonlocal electrical  conductance experimental data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07246</a>
<br>
<i>Nadina Gheorghiu, Charles R. Ebbing, Timothy J. Haugan</i>
<br>
<br>
Experimental evidence of novel phenomena in hydrogenated graphite fibers is
found. An indirect excitonic mechanism is likely leading to a SC state below
the temperature Tc = 50 K, where the gap is divergent. Analysis of the gap
within the framework provided by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of
superconductivity shows that this is a multigap system. The energy gap data can
be better explained within the framework of topologically protected flat bands
applied to systems in which superconductivity occurs on the surface or at the
internal interfaces of the samples. The temperature dependence of the SC gap is
linear above 50 K. We use nonlocal differential conductance Gdiff(V) = dI(V)/dV
experimental data to show clear evidence of topological phenomena such as
interference of chiral asymmetric Andreev edge states and crossed Andreev
conversion. Gdiff(V) has a negative part that results from the nonlocal
coherence between electron and holes in the Andreev edge states. We conclude
that hydrogenated graphite bears the marks of an unconventional
high-temperature superconductor (HTSC).
