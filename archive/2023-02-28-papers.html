<h3>Deterministic Layer Thinning of Exfoliated Tellurene and Room  Temperature Photoluminescence with Large Exciton Binding Energy Observed in  TeO2</h3>

Due to its tunable band gap, anisotropic behavior, and superior
thermoelectric properties, device applications using layered tellurene (Te) are
becoming attractive. Here, we report a thinning technique for exfoliated
tellurene nanosheets using thermal annealing in an oxygen environment. We
characterize different thinning parameters including temperature and annealing
time. Based on our measurements, we show that controlled layer thinning occurs
in the narrow temperature range of 325 oC to 350 oC. We also show a reliable
method to form \b{eta}-tellurene oxide (\b{eta}- TeO2), which is an emerging
wide band gap semiconductor with promising electronic and optoelectronic
properties. This wide band gap semiconductor exhibits a broad photoluminescence
(PL) spectrum with multiple peaks covering the range 1.76 eV to 2.08 eV. This
PL emission coupled with Raman spectra are strong evidence of the formation of
2D \b{eta}- TeO2. We discuss the results obtained and the mechanisms of Te
thinning and \b{eta}-TeO2 formation at different temperature regimes. We also
discuss the optical band gap of \b{eta}-TeO2 and show the existence of
pronounced excitonic effects evident by the large exciton binding energy in
this 2D \b{eta}-TeO2 system that reach 1.54 eV to 1.62 eV for bulk to
monolayer, respectively. Our work can be utilized to have better control over
Te nanosheet thickness. It also sheds light on the formation of well-controlled
\b{eta}-TeO2 layered semiconductor for electronic and optoelectronic
applications.

We study localisation transition in a class of quasi-periodic systems that
has two competing periodic scales. We show that such class of systems show a
re-entrant localisation transition where the energy scale of transition is set
by the periodicities of these two scales. Furthermore we show dynamical
properties in these systems, exhibits various kinds critical dynamics including
sub-diffusive, super-diffusive and diffusive spread of an initially localised
wave-packet. Finally we show that these characteristics of quasi-periodic
systems with two periodic scales can be realised within the regime of current
experiments.

Heat flux ($J$) generally increases with temperature difference in a
material. A differential coefficient of $J$ against temperature ($T$) is called
differential thermal conductance ($k$), and an inverse of $k$ is differential
thermal resistance ($r$). Although $k$ and $r$ are generally positive, they can
be negative in a macroscopic heterojunction with positive $T$-dependent
interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). The negative differential thermal
resistance (NDTR) effect is an important effect that can realize thermal
transistor, thermal memory, and thermal logic gate. In this paper, we examine
analytical expressions of $J$, $k$, $r$, and other related quantities as a
function of parameters related to thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) and ITR in a
macroscopic heterojunction to precisely describe the NDTR effect.

Controlling and understanding electron correlations in quantum matter is one
of the most challenging tasks in materials engineering. In the past years a
plethora of new puzzling correlated states have been found by carefully
stacking and twisting two-dimensional van der Waals materials of different
kind. Unique to these stacked structures is the emergence of correlated phases
not foreseeable from the single layers alone. In Ta-dichalcogenide
heterostructures made of a good metallic 1H- and a Mott-insulating 1T-layer,
recent reports have evidenced a cross-breed itinerant and localized nature of
the electronic excitations, similar to what is typically found in heavy fermion
systems. Here, we put forward a new interpretation based on first-principles
calculations which indicates a sizeable charge transfer of electrons (0.4-0.6
e) from 1T to 1H layers at an elevated interlayer distance. We accurately
quantify the strength of the interlayer hybridization which allows us to
unambiguously determine that the system is much closer to a doped Mott
insulator than to a heavy fermion scenario. Ta-based heterolayers provide
therefore a new ground for quantum-materials engineering in the regime of
heavily doped Mott insulators hybridized with metallic states at a van der
Waals distance.

With an increasing number of experiments observing phonon thermal Hall effect
in magnets, it is theoretically desired to have a minimal model for the phonon
thermal Hall effect. In this work, we study a simple model of acoustic phonons
and uncorrelated paramagnetic doublets. When the doublets are non-Kramers, a
linear pseudospin-phonon coupling is allowed by time-reversal symmetry and
yields resonant phonon-pseudospin scattering. We compute the thermal
longitudinal and Hall conductivities of the model and found qualitative
agreement with recent experiments in $\rm{Pr}_2\rm{Ir}_2\rm{O}_7$.

<h3>Weiss Oscillations and Galilei Invariance</h3>

Standard field theoretic formulations of composite fermion theories for the
anomalous metals that form at or near even-denominator filling fractions of the
lowest Landau level do not possess Galilei invariance. To restore Galilei
symmetry, these theories must be supplemented by "correction" terms. We study
the effect of the leading "correction" term, known as the dipole term, in the
Dirac composite fermion theory (a theory that consists of a Dirac fermion
coupled to an Abelian Chern-Simons gauge field) on quantum oscillations in the
electrical resistivity due to a periodic scalar potential about
even-denominator filling fractions. We find the dipole term to be insufficient
to resolve the systematic discrepancy, discovered in [Kamburov et. al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 113, 196801 (2014)], between the locations of the oscillation minima
predicted by Dirac composite fermion theory without Galilei invariance and
those observed in experiment. Further, in contrast to [Hossain et al., Phys.
Rev. B 100, 041112 (2019)], we find the quantum oscillations about the
half-filled and quarter-filled lowest Landau level to have qualitatively
similar behavior. This analysis uses a mean-field approximation, in which gauge
field fluctuations are neglected. Based on this and previous analyses, we
speculate the discrepancy with experiment may be an indirect signature of the
effect of gauge field fluctuations in composite fermion theory.

<h3>From the XXZ chain to the integrable Rydberg-blockade ladder via  non-invertible duality defects</h3>

Strongly interacting models often possess ``dualities'' subtler than a
one-to-one mapping of energy levels. The maps can be non-invertible, as
apparent from the canonical example of Kramers and Wannier. We find an
algebraic structure in the XXZ spin chain and three other Hamiltonians that
guarantees all are integrable. The other models describe Rydberg-blockade
bosons with one particle per square of a ladder, a three-state antiferromagnet,
and two Ising chains coupled in a zigzag fashion. We construct explicit
non-invertible maps between them using topological defects coming from fusion
categories and the lattice version of the orbifold construction. The Rydberg
and Ising examples also possess interesting non-invertible symmetries, with one
spontaneously broken in the gapped phase of the former. We give explicit
conformal-field-theory partition functions describing their critical regions,
in particular showing that the integrable Rydberg-blockade ladder is an $S_3$
orbifold of the XXZ chain.

<h3>Bound states in the continuum and Majorana zero modes in a double  quantum dot interferometer: Ghost-Fano Majorana effect</h3>

We investigate the transport properties through a nanostructure composed of
parallel double quantum dots coupled to two normal contacts. Additionally, each
quantum dot is connected to a topological superconducting nanowire, hosting
Majorana zero modes at its ends. A magnetic flux threading across the area
enclosed by the interferometer is considered. First, we investigate the
physical quantities of the system employing Green's function formalism. We find
that the emergence of bound states appears in symmetric configurations of
topological superconducting nanowires, i.e., depending on their lengths and
coupling energies to the quantum dots. Also, we find a transport suppression
anomaly as a function of the magnetic flux in the same symmetric configurations
mentioned above. Besides, we find that the magnetic flux controls both the
projection of Majorana zero modes and of the bound states in the continuum into
the density of states and the linear conductance, suggesting that only by
switching this parameter can we manipulate both bound states.

<h3>Terminable Transitions in a Topological Fermionic Ladder</h3>

Interacting fermionic ladders are important platforms to study quantum phases
of matter, such as different types of Mott insulators. In particular, the
D-Mott and S-Mott states hold pre-formed fermion pairs and become
paired-fermion liquids upon doping (d-wave and s-wave, respectively). We show
that the D-Mott and S-Mott phases are in fact two facets of the same
topological phase and that the transition between them is terminable. These
results provide a quantum analog of the well-known terminable liquid-to-gas
transition. However, the phenomenology we uncover is even richer, as in
contrast to the former, the order of the transition can be tuned by the
interactions from continuous to first-order. The findings are based on
numerical results using the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS)
formalism for infinite systems, and the density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) algorithm for finite systems. This is complemented by analytical
field-theoretical explanations. In particular, we present an effective theory
to explain the change of transition order, which is potentially applicable to a
broad range of other systems. The role of symmetries and edge states are
briefly discussed.

<h3>Even-odd effects in the $J_1-J_2$ SU($N$) Heisenberg spin chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14090</a>
<br>
<i>Loïc Herviou, Sylvain Capponi, Philippe Lecheminant</i>
<br>
<br>
The zero-temperature phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$ SU($N$) antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg spin chain is investigated by means of complementary field theory
and numerical approaches for general $N$. A fully gapped SU($N$) valence bond
solid made of $N$ sites is formed above a critical value of $J_2/J_1$ for all
$N$. We find that the extension of this $N$-merized phase for larger values of
$J_2$ strongly depends on the parity of $N$. For even $N$, the phase smoothly
interpolates to the large $J_2$ regime where the model can be viewed as a
zigzag SU($N$) two-leg spin ladder. The phase exhibits both a $N$-merized
ground state and incommensurate spin-spin correlations. In stark contrast to
the even case, we show that the $N$-merized phase with odd $N$ only has a
finite extent with no incommensuration. A gapless phase in the SU($N$)$_1$
universality class is stabilized for larger $J_2$ that stems from the existence
of a massless renormalization group flow from SU($N$)$_2$ to SU($N$)$_1$
conformal field theories when $N$ is odd.

The dynamics of defect excitations in crystalline solids is necessary to
understand the macroscopic low-energy properties of elastic media. We use
fracton-elasticity duality to systematically study the defect dynamics and
interactions in the linear isotropic medium. We derive the explicit expressions
for the dual gauge potentials for moving dislocations and the resulting
Jefimenko's equations. We also compute stresses and strains. The study includes
two physical situations: when vacancies are absent and when they are present in
the solid. If defects are present we show a constraint that needs to be
satisfied by the when they climb perpendicularly to their Burgers vector. Next,
we extend the classic result of Peach and Koehler for the force between two
dislocations and show that, similarly, to moving charges in electrodynamics, it
is non-reciprocal, when one dislocation is moving. We argue that our formalism
can be extended beyond Cauchy's elasticity by exploiting the simplifications
provided by the dual gauge formulation of elastic stresses.

<h3>WhereWulff: A semi-autonomous workflow for systematic catalyst surface  reactivity under reaction conditions</h3>

This paper introduces WhereWulff, a semi-autonomous workflow for modeling the
reactivity of catalyst surfaces. The workflow begins with a bulk optimization
task that takes an initial bulk structure, and returns the optimized bulk
geometry and magnetic state, including stability under reaction conditions. The
stable bulk structure is the input to a surface chemistry task that enumerates
surfaces up to a user-specified maximum Miller index, computes relaxed surface
energies for those surfaces, and then prioritizes those for subsequent
adsorption energy calculations based on their contribution to the Wulff
construction shape. The workflow handles computational resource constraints
such as limited wall-time as well as automated job submission and analysis. We
illustrate the workflow for oxygen evolution (OER) intermediates on two double
perovskites. WhereWulff nearly halved the number of Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations from ~ 240 to ~ 132 by prioritizing terminations, up to a
maximum Miller index of 1, based on surface stability. Additionally, it
automatically handled the 180 additional re-submission jobs required to
successfully converge 120+ atoms systems under a 48-hour wall-time cluster
constraint. There are four main use cases that we envision for WhereWulff: (1)
as a first-principles source of truth to validate and update a closed-loop
self-sustaining materials discovery pipeline, (2) as a data generation tool,
(3) as an educational tool, allowing users (e.g. experimentalists) unfamiliar
with OER modeling to probe materials they might be interested in before doing
further in-domain analyses, (4) and finally as a starting point for users to
extend with reactions other than OER, as part of a collaborative software
community.

<h3>Raman and Far Infrared Synchrotron Nanospectroscopy of Layered  Crystalline Talc: Vibrational Properties, Interlayer Coupling and Symmetry  Crossover</h3>

Talc is an insulating layered material that is stable at ambient conditions
and has high-quality basal cleavage, which is a major advantage for its use in
van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we use near-field synchrotron infrared
nanospectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations to
investigate the structural and vibrational properties of talc crystals, ranging
from monolayer to bulk, in the 300-750 cm-1 and <60 cm-1 spectral windows. We
observe a symmetry crossover from mono to bilayer talc samples, attributed to
the stacking of adjacent layers. The in-plane lattice parameters and
frequencies of intralayer modes of talc display weak dependence with the number
of layers, consistent with a weak interlayer interaction. On the other hand,
the low-frequency (<60 cm-1) rigid-layer (interlayer) modes of talc are
suitable to identify the number of layers in ultrathin talc samples, besides
revealing strong in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy in the interlayer force
constants and related elastic stiffnesses of single crystals. The shear and
breathing force constants of talc are found to be 66% and 28%, respectively,
lower than those of graphite, making talc an excellent lubricant that can be
easily exfoliated. Our results broaden the understanding of the structural and
vibrational properties of talc at the nanoscale regime and serve as a guide for
future ultrathin heterostructures applications.

<h3>Viscous dissipation in a gas of one-dimensional fermions with generic  dispersion</h3>

<br>
<i>Wade DeGottardi, K. A. Matveev</i>
<br>
<br>
A well-known feature of the classical monoatomic gas is that its bulk
viscosity is strongly suppressed because the single-particle dispersion is
quadratic. On the other hand, in condensed matter systems the effective
single-particle dispersion is altered by lattice effects and interactions. In
this work, we study the bulk viscosity of one-dimensional Fermi gases with
generic energy-momentum dispersion relations. As an application, viscous
dissipation arising from lattice effects is analyzed for the tight-binding
model. In addition, we investigate how weak interactions affect the bulk
viscosity. Finally, we discuss viscous dissipation in the regime in which the
Fermi gas is not fully equilibrated, as can occur when the system is driven at
frequencies that exceed the rate of fermion backscattering. In this case, the
Fermi gas is described by three bulk viscosities, which we obtain for a generic
single-particle dispersion.

When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In
other words, when is the network injective? We consider a single layer, $x
\mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)$, with a random Gaussian $m \times n$ matrix $W$, in
a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this
problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp
injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler
characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and
show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the
spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By
leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive
analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from
the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to
prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic
prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key
ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible
to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses
and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the
discrepancies.

<br>
A major roadblock to scalable quantum computing is phase decoherence and
energy relaxation caused by qubits interacting with defect-related two-level
systems (TLS). Native oxides present on the surfaces of superconducting metals
used in quantum devices are acknowledged to be a source of TLS that decrease
qubit coherence times. Reducing microwave loss by surface engineering (i.e.,
replacing uncontrolled native oxide of superconducting metals with a thin,
stable surface with predictable characteristics) can be a key enabler for
pushing performance forward with devices of higher quality factor. In this
work, we present a novel approach to replace the native oxide of niobium
(typically formed in an uncontrolled fashion when its pristine surface is
exposed to air) with an engineered oxide, using a room-temperature process that
leverages Accelerated Neutral Atom Beam (ANAB) technology at 300 mm wafer
scale. This ANAB beam is composed of a mixture of argon and oxygen, with
tunable energy per atom, which is rastered across the wafer surface. The
ANAB-engineered Nb-oxide thickness was found to vary from 2 nm to 6 nm
depending on ANAB process parameters. Modeling of variable-energy XPS data
confirm thickness and compositional control of the Nb surface oxide by the ANAB
process. These results correlate well with those from transmission electron
microscopy and X-ray reflectometry. Since ANAB is broadly applicable to
material surfaces, the present study indicates its promise for modification of
the surfaces of superconducting quantum circuits to achieve longer coherence
times.

<h3>Concepts and use cases for picosecond ultrasonics with x-rays</h3>

This review discusses picosecond ultrasonics experiments using ultrashort
hard x-ray probe pulses to extract the transient strain response of
laser-excited nanoscopic structures from Bragg-peak shifts. This method
provides direct, layer-specific, and quantitative information on the picosecond
strain response for structures down to few-nm thickness. We model the transient
strain using the inhomogeneous elastic wave equation and express the driving
stress using Gr\"uneisen parameters stating that the laser-induced stress is
proportional to energy density changes in the microscopic subsystems of the
solid, i.e. electrons, phonons and spins. The laser-driven strain response can
thus serve as an ultrafast proxy for local energy-density and temperature
changes, but we emphasize the importance of the nanoscale morphology for an
accurate interpretation due to the Poisson effect. The presented experimental
use cases encompass ultrathin and opaque metal-heterostructures, continuous and
granular nanolayers as well as negative thermal expansion materials, that each
pose a challenge to established all-optical techniques.

<h3>Dynamical Mean Field Theory extension to the nonequilibrium Two-Particle  Self-Consistent approach</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonlocal correlations play an essential role in correlated electron systems,
especially in the vicinity of phase transitions and crossovers, where
two-particle correlation functions display a distinct momentum dependence. In
nonequilibrium settings, the effect of nonlocal correlations on dynamical phase
transitions, prethermalization phenomena and trapping in metastable states is
not well understood. In this paper, we introduce a dynamical mean field theory
(DMFT) extension to the nonequilibrium Two-particle Self-Consistent (TPSC)
approach, which allows to perform nonequilibrium simulations capturing short-
and long-ranged nonlocal correlations in the weak-, intermediate- and
strong-correlation regime. The method self-consistently computes local spin and
charge vertices, from which a momentum-dependent self-energy is constructed.
Replacing the local part of the self-energy by the DMFT result within this
self-consistent scheme provides an improved description of local correlation
effects. We explain the details of the formalism and the implementation, and
demonstrate the versatility of DMFT+TPSC with lattice hopping quenches and
dimensional crossovers in the Hubbard model.

<h3>Griffiths Phase in a Facilitated Rydberg Gas at Low Temperature</h3>

The spread of excitations by Rydberg facilitation bears many similarities to
epidemics. Such systems can be modeled with Monte-Carlo simulations of
classical rate equations to great accuracy as a result of high dephasing. In
this paper, we analyze the dynamics of a Rydberg many-body system in the
facilitation regime in the limits of high and low temperatures. While in the
high-temperature limit a homogeneous mean-field behaviour is recovered,
characteristic effects of heterogeneity can be seen in a frozen gas. At large
temperatures the system displays an absorbing-state phase transition and, in
the presence of an additional loss channel, self-organized criticality. In a
frozen or low-temperature gas, excitations are constrained to a network
resembling an Erd\"os-Renyi graph. We show that the absorbing-state phase
transition is replaced with an extended Griffiths phase, which we accurately
describe by a susceptible-infected-susceptible model on the Erd\"os-Renyi
network taking into account Rydberg blockade. Furthermore, we expand upon an
existing macroscopic Langevin equation to more accurately describe the density
of Rydberg atoms in the frozen and finite temperature regimes.

A microscopic description is given for the behavior of the fluid system in an
immediate vicinity of its critical point, where theoretical and experimental
researches are difficult to carry out. For the temperatures $T<T_c$, the
regions of chemical potential and density variations are singled out and
analyzed. The equation of state of the cell fluid model in terms of
temperature-chemical potential is written using the Heaviside functions. This
equation is also given in terms of the temperature and density variables. As a
result of the study of the relationship between the density and the chemical
potential, an equation for the binodal curve is obtained in a narrow
neighborhood of the critical point.

We introduce a systematic construction of higher-order matrix product
operator (MPO) approximations of the time evolution operator for generic (short
and long range) one-dimensional Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the utility of our
construction, by showing an order of magnitude speedup in simulation cost

<br>
We study gated field effect transistors (FETs) with fractal geometries under
Dyakonov and Shur asymmetric boundary conditions, where the source and drain
span the left and right edges of the device respectively. An AC THz potential
difference is applied between source and gate while a static source-drain
voltage, rectified by the nonlinearities of FET electrons, is measured. We
find, for a recursion depth, n, that resonant peaks in the potential integrated
along the drain at ${\omega}_n = 3n{\omega}_0$ are amplified while all other
are diminished. Additionally, we find the presence of peaks with frequencies
dependent on the fractal dimensions of both the Sierpinski carpet and a similar
alternative fractal. We then show the advantage of employing the alternative
fractal as a superior geometry for the photodetector when compared to the
Sierpinski carpet.

The prediction and subsequent discovery of topological semimetal phases of
matter in solid state systems has instigated a surge of activity investigating
the exotic properties of these unusual materials. Amongst these are transport
signatures which can be attributed to the chiral anomaly; the breaking of
classical chiral symmetry in a quantum theory. This remarkable quantum
phenomenon, first discovered in the context of particle physics has now found
new life in condensed matter physics, connecting topological quantum matter and
band theory with effective field theoretic models. In this paper we investigate
the interplay between interactions and the chiral anomaly in field theories
inspired by semimetals using Fujikawa's path integral method. Starting from
models in one spatial dimension we discuss how the presence of interactions can
affect the consequences of the chiral anomaly leading to renormalization of
excitations and their transport properties. This is then generalised to the
three dimensional case where we show that the anomalous response of the system,
namely the chiral magnetic and quantum hall effects, are modified by the
presence of interactions. These properties are investigated further through the
identification of anomalous modes which exist within interacting Weyl
semimetals. These massive excitations are nonperturbative in nature and are a
direct consequence of the chiral anomaly. The effects of interactions on mixed
axial-gravitational anomalies are then investigated and the conditions required
for interactions effects to be observed are discussed.

Semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have equivalent
dynamics for their two spin/valley species. This arises from their
energy-degenerated spin states, connected via time-reversal symmetry. When an
out-of-plane magnetic field is applied, time-reversal symmetry is broken and
the energies of the spin-polarized bands shift, resulting in different bandgaps
and dynamics in the K$_+$ and K$_-$ valleys. Here, we use time-resolved Kerr
rotation to study the magnetic field dependence of the spin dynamics in
monolayer MoSe$_2$. We show that the magnetic field can control the
light-induced spin accumulation of the two valley states, with a small effect
on the recombination lifetimes. We unveil that the magnetic field-dependent
spin accumulation is in agreement with hole spin dynamics at the longer
timescales, indicating that the electron spins have faster relaxation rates. We
propose a rate equation model that suggests that lifting the energy-degeneracy
of the valleys induces an ultrafast spin-flip toward the stabilization of the
valley with the higher valence band energy. Our results provide an experimental
insight into the ultrafast charge and spin dynamics in TMDs and a way to
control it, which will be useful for the development of new spintronic and
valleytronic applications.

<br>
We report the first observation of ferroelectric gating in AlScN barrier
wide-bandgap nitride transistors. These FerroHEMT devices realized by direct
epitaxial growth represent a new class of ferroelectric transistors in which
the semiconductor is itself polar, and the crystalline ferroelectric barrier is
lattice-matched to the substrate. The FerroHEMTs reported here use the thinnest
nitride high K and ferroelectric barriers to date to deliver the highest on
currents at 4 A/mm, and highest speed AlScN transistors with fmax larger than
150 GHz observed in any ferroelectric transistor. The FerroHEMTs exhibit
hysteretic Id Vgs loops with subthreshold slopes below the Boltzmann limit. A
control AlN barrier HEMT exhibits neither hysteretic, nor sub Boltzmann
behavior. While these results introduce the first epitaxial high K and
ferroelectric barrier technology to RF and mm wave electronics, they are also
of interest as a new material platform for combining memory and logic
functionalities in digital electronics.

Steelmaking contributes 8% to the total CO2 emissions globally, primarily due
to coal-based iron ore reduction. Clean hydrogen-based ironmaking has variable
performance because the dominant gas-solid reduction mechanism is set by the
defects and pores inside the mm-nm sized oxide particles that change
significantly as the reaction progresses. While these governing dynamics are
essential to establish continuous flow of iron and its ores through reactors,
the direct link between agglomeration and chemistry is still contested due to
missing measurements. In this work, we directly measure the connection between
chemistry and agglomeration in the smallest iron oxides relevant to magnetite
ores. Using synthesized spherical 10-nm magnetite particles reacting in H2, we
resolve the formation and consumption of w\"ustite (FeO) - the step most
commonly attributed to agglomeration. Using X-ray scattering and microscopy, we
resolve crystallographic anisotropy in the rate of the initial reaction, which
becomes isotropic as the material sinters. Complementing with imaging, we
demonstrate how the particles self-assemble, subsequently react and sinter into
~100x oblong grains. Our insights into how morphologically uniform iron oxide
particles react and agglomerate H2 reduction enable future size-dependent
models to effectively describe the multiscale iron ore reduction.

In the extreme quantum limit states under high magnetic fields, enhanced
electronic correlation effects can stabilize anomalous quantum states. Using
band-tuning with a magnetic field, we realized a spin-polarized quantum limit
state in the field-induced semimetallic phase of a topological insulator
Bi_{1-x}Sb_x. Further increase in the field injects more electrons and holes to
this state and results in an unexpected reentrant insulator state in this
topological semimetallic state. A single-particle picture cannot explain this
reentrant insulator state, reminiscent of phase transitions due to many-body
effects. Estimates of the binding energy and spacing of electron-hole pairs and
the thermal de Broglie wavelength indicate that Bi_{1-x}Sb_x may host the
excitonic insulator phase in this extreme environment.

The simulation of large-scale systems with complex electron interactions
remains one of the greatest challenges for the atomistic modeling of materials.
Although classical force-fields often fail to describe the coupling between
electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate
\textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity
that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to
study many technologically relevant phenomena, such as reactions, ion
migrations, phase transformations, and degradation.
In this work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network
(CHGNet) as a novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a
graph-neural-network-based force-field to model a universal potential energy
surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic
moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over
10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of
$\sim 1.5$ million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic
moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy
of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic
degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in
solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in
Li$_x$MnO$_2$, the finite temperature phase diagram for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ and Li
diffusion in garnet conductors. We critically analyze the significance of
including charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry, and we
provide new insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of
freedom that can not be observed by previous MLIPs.

We propose a spin-orbit-coupled Floquet spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
which can be implemented by a Floquet engineering of quadratic Zeeman field.
The Floquet spinor BEC has a Bessel-function-modulated Rabi frequency and a
Floquet-induced spin-exchange interaction. Quantum phase diagram of a
spin-orbit-coupled Floquet spinor BEC is investigated by considering
antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions. In comparison with a
usual spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 BEC, we find that a stripe phase for
antiferromagnetic interactions can exist in a large quadratic Zeeman field
regime, and a new stripe phase with an experimentally favorable contrast for
ferromagnetic interactions is uncovered.

<h3>Linear and nonlinear spin current response in anisotropic spin-orbit  coupled systems</h3>

We calculate the linear and the second harmonic (SH) spin current response of
two anisotropic systems with spin orbit (SO) interaction. The first system is a
two-dimensional (2D) electron gas in the presence of Rashba and k-linear
Dresselhaus SO couplings. The dependence of the anisotropic spin splitting on
the sample growth direction introduces an additional path to modify the linear
and nonlinear spectra. In particular, vanishing linear and second order spin
conductivity tensors are achievable under SU(2) symmetry conditions,
characterized by a collinear SO vector field. Additional conditions under which
specific tensor components vanish are posible, without having such
collinearity. Thus, a proper choice of the growth direction and SO strengths
allows to select the polarization of the linear and SH spin currents according
to the direction of flowing. The second system is an anisotropic 2D free
electron gas with anisotropic Rashba interaction, which has been employed to
study the optical conductivity of 2D puckered structures with anisotropic
energy bands. The presence of mass anisotropy and an energy gap open several
distinct scenarios for the allowed optical interband transitions, which
manifest in the linear and SH response contrastingly. The linear response
displays only out-of-plane spin polarized currents, while the SH spin currents
flow with spin orientation lying parallel to the plane of the system strictly.
The models illustrate the possibility of the nonlinear spin Hall effect in
systems with SO interaction, under the presence or absence of time-reversal
symmetry. The results suggest different ways to manipulate the linear

spectrum in a mixture of ${}^{167}$Er($F = 19/2, m_F = -19/2$)-${}^6$Li($F =
1/2, m_F = 1/2$) atoms in the microkelvin temperature regime. These
temperatures are achieved by means of sympathetic cooling with ${}^{174}$Yb as
a third species. Interspecies Feshbach resonances are then identified by
investigation of the Er-Li inelastic collisional properties for magnetic fields
up to 800 G. Numerous narrow resonances as well as six resonances with widths
above 1 G could be identified. It is these broader resonances that hold much
promise for interesting future investigations of, for exmample, novel
superfluid states and Efimov states in large mass-imbalanced, all-fermionic
two-component systems.

<h3>Effect of carbon doping on the structure and superconductivity in  AlB$_{2}$-type (Mo$_{0.96}$Ti$_{0.04}$)$_{0.8}$B$_{2}$</h3>

We report the effect of carbon doping in Ti-stabilized nonstoichiometric
molybdenum diboride (Mo$_{0.96}$Ti$_{0.04}$)$_{0.8}$B$_{2}$, which exhibits
bulk superconductivity below $T_{\rm c}$ = 7.0 K. It is found that
(Mo$_{0.96}$Ti$_{0.04}$)$_{0.8}$(B$_{1-x}$C$_{x}$)$_{2}$ maintains the
AlB$_{2}$-type phase with a uniform elemental distribution for $x$ = 0.12 and
0.16. The substitution of carbon for boron leads to a slight increase in
$a$-axis, a remarkable reduction in $c$-axis, the formation of planar defects
along the (100) crystallographic planes, and a shift of the B 1$s$ peaks
towards higher binding energies. Contrary to
(Mo$_{0.96}$Ti$_{0.04}$)$_{0.8}$B$_{2}$, however, no superconductivity is
observed down to 1.8 K for the C-doped samples, which is ascribed to the
electron filling of boron $\pi$ bands resulting from the carbon doping.

Gate tunable two-dimensional (2D) superconductors offer significant
advantages when studying superconducting phase transitions. Here, we address
superconductivity in exfoliated 1T'-MoTe2 monolayers with an intrinsic band gap
of ~7.3 meV using electrostatic doping. Despite large differences in the
dispersion of the conduction and the valence bands, superconductivity can be
achieved easily for both electrons and holes. The onset of superconductivity
occurs near 7-8K for both charge carrier types. This temperature is much higher
than in bulk samples. Also the in-plane upper critical field is strongly
enhanced and exceeds the BCS Pauli limit in both cases. Gap information is
extracted using point-contact spectroscopy. The gap ratio exceeds multiple
times the value expected for BCS weak-coupling. All these observations suggest
a strong enhancement of the pairing interaction.

The layered square-planar nickelates, Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{2n+2}$, are an
appealing system to tune the electronic properties of square-planar nickelates
via dimensionality; indeed, superconductivity was recently observed in
Nd$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$ thin films. Here, we investigate the role of epitaxial
strain in the competing requirements for the synthesis of the $n=3$
Ruddlesden-Popper compound, Nd$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, and subsequent reduction
to the square-planar phase, Nd$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{8}$. We synthesize our highest
quality Nd$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ films under compressive strain on LaAlO$_{3}$
(001), while Nd$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ on NdGaO$_{3}$ (110) exhibits tensile
strain-induced rock salt faults but retains bulk-like transport properties. A
high density of extended defects forms in Nd$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ on
SrTiO$_{3}$ (001). Films reduced on LaAlO$_{3}$ become insulating and form
compressive strain-induced $c$-axis canting defects, while
Nd$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{8}$ films on NdGaO$_{3}$ are metallic. This work provides a
pathway to the synthesis of Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{2n+2}$ thin films and sets
limits on the ability to strain engineer these compounds via epitaxy.

This thesis describes several topics related to finite temperature studies of
strongly correlated systems: finite temperature density matrix embedding theory
(FT-DMET), finite temperature metal-insulator transition, and quantum
algorithms including quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE), quantum Lanczos
(QLanczos), and quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS)
algorithms. While the absolute zero temperature is not reachable, studies of
physical and chemical problems at finite temperatures, especially at low
temperature, is essential for understanding the quantum behaviors of materials
in realistic conditions. Here we define low temperature as the temperature
regime where the quantum effect is not largely dissipated due to thermal
fluctuation. Treatment of systems at low temperatures is especially difficult
compared to both high temperatures - where classical approximation can be
applied - and zero temperatures where only the ground state is required to
describe the system of interest.

Superconducting circuits are among the most advanced quantum computing
technologies, however their performance is currently limited by losses found in
surface oxides and disordered materials. Here, we identify and spatially
localize a near-field signature of loss centers on tantalum films using
terahertz scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM).
Making use of terahertz nanospectroscopy, we observe a localized excess
vibrational mode around 0.5 THz and identify this resonance as the boson peak,
a signature of amorphous materials. Grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray
scattering (GIWAXS) shows that oxides on freshly solvent-cleaned samples are
amorphous, whereas crystalline phases emerge after aging in air. By localizing
defect centers at the nanoscale, our characterization techniques and results
will inform the optimization of fabrication procedures for new low-loss
superconducting circuits.

A recent experiment shows surprising glass-like features [npj Quantum
Materials 6, 1 (2021)] in the nearly disorder-free $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a Kitaev
spin liquid candidate, at low temperatures in the intermediate magnetic field
region. Inspired by this experiment, we study the Kitaev model within the
density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method in the presence of a
magnetic field at zero temperature. We find five distinct phases with
increasing magnetic field, which are characterized by a homogeneous flux phase,
the Z2 vortex gas, solid and emergent glass phase in the so-called U(1) spin
liquid region, and finally a spin-polarized phase. The emergent glassiness is
confirmed by calculating correlation functions as well as ground state
fidelity, showing a plethora of energetically accessible orthogonal saddle
points corresponding to different flux configurations. Taking our result
together with previous theories of emergent glassiness in disorder-free quantum
many-body systems, we propose that glassiness is intrinsic to disorder-free
generic quantum spin liquids.

We demonstrate that a correlated equilibrium $f$-electron system with
time-reversal symmetry can exhibit a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ non-Hermitian skin effect
of quasi-particles. In particular, we analyze a two-dimensional periodic
Anderson model with spin-orbit coupling by combining the dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT) and the numerical renormalization group. We prove the existence
of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect by explicitly calculating the topological
invariant and show that spin-orbit interaction is essential to this effect. Our
DMFT analysis demonstrates that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect of
quasi-particles is reflected on the pseudo-spectrum. Furthermore, we analyze
temperature effects on this skin effect using the generalized Brillouin zone
technique, which clarifies that the skin modes are strongly localized above the
Kondo temperature.

Elemental materials provide clean and fundamental platforms for studying
superconductivity. However, the highest superconducting critical temperature
(Tc) yet observed in elements has not exceeded 30 K. Discovering elemental
superconductors with a higher Tc is one of the most fundamental and challenging
tasks in condensed matter physics. In this study, by applying high pressure up
to approximately 260 GPa, we demonstrate that the superconducting transition
temperature of elemental scandium (Sc) can be increased to 36 K, which is a
record-high Tc for superconducting elements. The pressure dependence of Tc
implies the occurrence of multiple phase transitions in Sc, which is in
agreement with previous X-ray diffraction results. Optimization of Tc is
achieved in the Sc-V phase, which can be attributed to the strong coupling
between d electrons and moderate-frequency phonons, as suggested by our
first-principles calculations. This study provides insights for exploring new
high-Tc elemental metals.

The exact solution of the Ising model on the complete graph (CG) provides an
important, though mean-field, insight for the theory of continuous phase
transitions. Besides the original spin, the Ising model can be formulated in
the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random-cluster and the loop representation, in which many
geometric quantities have no correspondence in the spin representations. Using
a lifted-worm irreversible algorithm, we study the CG-Ising model in the loop
representation, and, based on theoretical and numerical analyses, obtain a
number of exact results including volume fractal dimensions and scaling forms.
Moreover, by combining with the Loop-Cluster algorithm, we demonstrate how the
loop representation can provide an intuitive understanding to the recently
observed rich geometric phenomena in the random-cluster representation,
including the emergence of two configuration sectors, two length scales and two
scaling windows.

Analyzing and modeling the constitutive behavior of materials is a core area
in materials sciences and a prerequisite for conducting numerical simulations
in which the material behavior plays a central role. Constitutive models have
been developed since the beginning of the 19th century and are still under
constant development. Besides physics-motivated and phenomenological models,
during the last decades, the field of constitutive modeling was enriched by the
development of machine learning-based constitutive models, especially by using
neural networks. The latter is the focus of the present review, which aims to
give an overview of neural networks-based constitutive models from a methodical
perspective. The review summarizes and compares numerous conceptually different
neural networks-based approaches for constitutive modeling including neural
networks used as universal function approximators, advanced neural network
models and neural network approaches with integrated physical knowledge. The
upcoming of these methods is in-turn closely related to advances in the area of
computer sciences, what further adds a chronological aspect to this review. We
conclude this review paper with important challenges in the field of learning
constitutive relations that need to be tackled in the near future.

Skyrmions are prospected as the potential future of data storage due to their
topologically protected spin structures. However, traditional ferromagnetic
(FM) skyrmions experience deflection when driven with an electric current,
hindering their usage in spintronics. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions,
consisting of two FM solitons coupled antiferromagnetically, are predicted to
have a zero Magnus force, making them promising candidates for spintronic
racetrack memories. Currently, they have been stabilized in synthetic AFM
structures, i.e. multilayers hosting FM skyrmions, which couple
antiferromagnetically through a non-magnetic spacer, while recent
first-principles simulations predict their emergence in an intrinsic form,
within an row-wise AFM single monolayer of Cr deposited on PdFe bilayer grown
on Ir(111) surfaces. The latter material forms a triangular lattice, where
single and interlinked AFM skyrmions can be stabilized. Here, we explore the
minimal Heisenberg model enabling the occurrence of such AFM solitons and the
underlying phase diagrams by accounting for the interplay between the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Heisenberg exchange interactions, as well as the
magnetic anisotropy and impact of magnetic field. By providing the fundamental
basis to identify and understand the behavior of intrinsic AFM skyrmions, we
anticipate our model to become a powerful tool for exploring and designing new
topological magnetic materials to conceptualize devices for AFM spintronics.

Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators are critical components for
particle accelerator applications such as free-electron lasers and for emerging
technologies in quantum computing. Developing advanced materials and their
deposition processes to produce RF superconductors that yield nano-ohm surface
resistances is a key metric for the wider adoption of SRF technology. Here we
report ZrNb(Cx) RF superconducting films with high critical temperatures (Tc,
13 -- 16 K) achieved for the first time under ambient pressure. The attainment
of a Tc near the theoretical limit for this material without applied pressure
is promising for its use in practical applications. A range of Tc, likely
arising from Zr doping variation, may allow a tunable superconducting coherence
length that lowers the sensitivity to material defects when an ultra-low
surface resistance is required. Our ZrNb(Cx) films are synthesized by a
low-temperature (100 -- 200 C) electrochemical recipe combined with thermal
annealing. The phase transformation as a function of annealing temperature and
time is optimized by the evaporated Zr-Nb diffusion couples. Through phase
control, we avoid hexagonal Zr phases that are equilibrium-stable but degrade
Tc. X-ray and electron diffraction combined with photoelectron spectroscopy
reveal a system containing cubic beta-ZrNb mixed with rocksalt NbC and
low-dielectric-loss ZrO2. We demonstrate proof-of-concept RF performance of
ZrNb(Cx) on an SRF sample test system. BCS resistance trends lower than
reference Nb, while quench fields occur at approximately 35 mT. Our results
demonstrate the potential of ZrNb(Cx) thin films for particle accelerator and
other SRF applications.

<h3>Impact of edge morphology and chemistry on nanoribbons' gapwidth</h3>

<br>
In this work, we scrutinise theoretically how the gap of C and BN armchair
nanoribbons changes upon variations of the bond length between edge atoms and
their distance from passivating species. Our DFT calculations indicate that the
gap of C-based nanoribbons is more sensitive to the relaxation of the bonding
length between edge atoms (morphology) whereas in BN-nanorribons it is more
sensitive to the distance between edge atoms and passivating hydrogens
(chemical environment). To understand the origin of these two different
behaviours, we solved a tight-binding ladder model numerically and at the
first-order perturbation theory, demonstrating that the different dependence is
due to the interference of the wavefunctions of the top valence and the bottom
conduction states.

A quasicrystal is an ordered but non-periodic structure understood as a
projection from a higher dimensional periodic structure. Some physical
properties of quasicrystals are different from those of conventional solids. An
anomalous increase in heat capacity at high temperatures has been discussed for
over two decades as a manifestation of a hidden high dimensionality of
quasicrystals. A plausible candidate for this origin has been phason, which has
excitation modes originating from additional degrees of freedom in the
higher-dimensional lattice. However, most theoretical studies on phasons have
used toy models. A theoretical study of the heat capacity of realistic
quasicrystals or their approximants has yet to be conducted because of the huge
computational complexity. To bridge this gap between experiment and theory, we
show experiments and molecular simulations on the same material, an Al--Pd--Ru
quasicrystal, and its approximants. We show that at high temperatures, aluminum
atoms diffuse with discontinuous-like jumps, and the diffusion paths of the
aluminum can be understood in terms of jumps corresponding to hyperatomic
fluctuations in six-dimensional space. It is concluded that the anomaly in the
heat capacity of quasicrystals arises from extra degrees of freedom due to
hyperatomic fluctuations that play a role in diffusive Nambu--Goldstone modes.

Permalloy, despite being a widely utilized soft magnetic material, still
calls for optimization in terms of magnetic softness and magnetostriction for
its use in magnetoresistive sensor applications. Conventional annealing methods
are often insufficient to locally achieve the desired properties for a narrow
parameter range. In this study, we report a significant improvement of the
magnetic softness and magnetostriction in a 30 nm Permalloy film after He$^+$
irradiation. Compared to the as-deposited state, the irradiation treatment
reduces the induced anisotropy by a factor ten and the hard axis coercivity by
a factor five. In addition, the effective magnetostriction of the film is
significantly reduced by a factor ten - below $1\times10^{-7}$ - after
irradiation. All the above mentioned effects can be attributed to the isotropic
crystallite growth of the Ni-Fe alloy and to the intermixing at the magnetic
layer interfaces under light ion irradiation. We support our findings with
X-ray diffraction analysis of the textured Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ alloy.
Importantly, the sizable magnetoresistance is preserved after the irradiation.
Our results show that compared to traditional annealing methods, the use of
He$^+$ irradiation leads to significant improvements in the magnetic softness
and reduces strain cross sensitivity in Permalloy films required for 3D
positioning and compass applications. These improvements, in combination with
the local nature of the irradiation process make our finding valuable for the
optimization of monolithic integrated sensors, where classic annealing methods
cannot be applied due to complex interplay within the components in the device.

We revisit and extend the standard bosonic interpretation of interlayer
excitons in the moir\'e potential of twisted heterostructures of
transition-metal dichalcogenides. In our experiments, we probe a high quality
MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals bilayer heterostructure via density-dependent
photoluminescence spectroscopy and reveal strongly developed, unconventional
spectral shifts of the emergent moir\'e exciton resonances. The observation of
saturating blueshifts of successive exciton resonances allow us to explain
their physics in terms of a model utilizing fermionic saturable absorbers. This
approach is strongly inspired by established quantum-dot models, which
underlines the close analogy of interlayer excitons trapped in pockets of the
moir\'e potential, and quantum emitters with discrete eigenstates.

Physical reservoir computing is a framework for brain-inspired information
processing that utilizes nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamics in
non-von-Neumann systems. In recent years, spintronic devices have been proposed
for use as physical reservoirs, but their practical application remains a major
challenge, mainly because thermal noise prevents them from retaining short-term
memory, the essence of neuromorphic computing. Here, we propose a framework for
spintronic physical reservoirs that exploits frequency domain dynamics in
interacting spins. Through the effective use of frequency filters, we
demonstrate, for a model of frustrated magnets, both robustness to thermal
fluctuations and feasibility of frequency division multiplexing. This scheme
can be coupled with parallelization in spatial domain even down to the level of
a single spin, yielding a vast number of spatiotemporal computational units.
Furthermore, the nonlinearity via the exchange interaction allows information
processing among different frequency threads. Our findings establish a design
principle for high-performance spintronic reservoirs with the potential for
highly integrated devices.

<br>
Hybrid Josephson junctions with three or more superconducting terminals
coupled to a semiconducting region are expected to exhibit a rich variety of
phenomena. Andreev bound states (ABSs) arising in such multiterminal devices
have been predicted to form unconventional energy band structures, which can be
engineered by controlling superconducting phase differences between the
individual terminals. Here we report tunnelling spectroscopy measurements of
three-terminal Josephson junctions (3TJJs) realised in a gate-tunable InAs/Al
heterostructure. The three terminals are connected to form two loops where
phase differences are independently controlled. Our results provide a
demonstration of phase control over a novel Andreev band structure. Signatures
of hybridisation between ABSs, consistent with their overlap in the 3TJJ
region, are observed in the form of avoided crossings in the spectrum and are
well explained by a numerical model. Future extensions of this work could focus
on addressing spin-resolved energy levels, ground state parity transitions and
Weyl bands in multiterminal geometries.

We investigate single crystals of the trigonal antiferromagnet EuZn$_2$P$_2$
($P\overline{3}m1$) by means of electrical transport, magnetization
measurements, X-ray magnetic scattering, optical reflectivity, angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ab-initio band structure calculations
(DFT+U). We find that the electrical resistivity of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ increases
strongly upon cooling and can be suppressed in magnetic fields by several
orders of magnitude (CMR effect). Resonant magnetic scattering reveals a
magnetic ordering vector of $q = (0\, 0\, \frac{1}{2})$, corresponding to an
$A$-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, below $T_{\rm N} = 23.7\,\rm K$. We
find that the moments are canted out of the $a-a$ plane by an angle of about
$40^{\circ}\pm 10^{\circ}$ degrees and tilted away from the [100] - direction
by $30^{\circ}\pm 5^{\circ}$. We observe nearly isotropic magnetization
behavior for low fields and low temperatures which is consistent with the
magnetic scattering results. The magnetization measurements show a deviation
from the Curie-Weiss behavior below $\approx 150\,\rm K$, the temperature below
which also the field dependence of the material's resistivity starts to
increase. An analysis of the infrared reflectivity spectrum at $T=295\,\rm K$
allows us to resolve the main phonon bands and intra-/interband transitions,
and estimate indirect and direct band gaps of
$E_i^{\mathrm{opt}}=0.09\,\rm{eV}$ and $E_d^{\mathrm{opt}}=0.33\,\rm{eV}$,
respectively, which are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted
ones. The experimental band structure obtained by ARPES is nearly
$T$-independent above and below $T_{\rm N}$. The comparison of the theoretical
and experimental data shows a weak intermixing of the Eu 4$f$ states close to
the $\Gamma$ point with the bands formed by the phosphorous 3$p$ orbitals
leading to an induction of a small magnetic moment at the P sites.

<br>
Tuning the bandgap in ternary III-V semiconductors via modification of the
composition or the strain in the material is a major approach for the design of
optoelectronic materials. Experimental approaches screening a large range of
possible target structures are hampered by the tremendous effort to optimize
the material synthesis for every target structure. We present an approach based
on density functional theory efficiently capable of providing the bandgap as a
function of composition and strain. Using a specific density functional
designed for accurate bandgap computation (TB09) together with a band unfolding
procedure and special quasirandom structures, we develop a computational
protocol efficiently able to predict bandgaps. The approach's accuracy is
validated by comparison to selected experimental data. We thus map the phase
space of composition and strain (we call this the 'bandgap phase diagram') for
several important III-V compound semiconductors: GaAsP, GaAsN, GaPSb, GaAsSb,
GaPBi, and GaAsBi. We show the application of these diagrams for identifying
the most promising materials for device design. Furthermore, our computational
protocol can easily be generalized to explore the vast chemical space of III-V
materials with all other possible combinations of III- and V-elements.

We discuss the interplay between many-body localization and spin-symmetry. To
this end, we study the time evolution of several observables in the anisotropic
t-J model. Like the Hubbard chain, the studied model contains charge and spin
degrees of freedom, yet it has smaller Hilbert space and thus allows for
numerical studies of larger systems. We compare the field disorder that breaks
the Z_2 spin symmetry and a potential disorder that preserves the latter
symmetry. In the former case, sufficiently strong disorder leads to
localization of all studied observables, at least for the studied system sizes.
However, in the case of symmetry-preserving disorder, we observe that odd
operators under the Z_2 spin transformation relax towards the equilibrium value
at relatively short time scales that grow only polynomially with the disorder
strength. On the other hand, the dynamics of even operators and the level
statistics within each symmetry sector are consistent with localization. Our
results indicate that localization exists within each symmetry sector for
symmetry preserving disorder. Odd operators' apparent relaxation is due to
their time evolution between distinct symmetry sectors.

This Thesis explores how tools from Statistical Physics and Information
Theory can help us describe and understand complex systems. In the first part,
we study the interplay between internal interactions, environmental changes,
and effective representations of complex stochastic systems. We model the
environment as an unobserved stochastic process and investigate how the mutual
information between internal degrees of freedom encodes internal and
environmental processes, and how it can help us disentangle them. Then, we
attempt to build effective representations via information-preserving
projections that preserve the dependencies of a complex system. In the
paradigmatic case of underdamped systems, we find that optimal effective
representations may be unexpectedly singular, revealing fundamental limits of
approximating complex models. In the second part of this Thesis, we apply these
approaches and ideas from criticality to neural systems at different scales,
showing that unobserved neural activity may lead to power-law neuronal
avalanches in the absence of criticality. Remarkably, the properties of mutual
information suggest that, whereas avalanches may emerge from stochastic
modulation, interactions between neural populations are at the source of
scale-free correlations. We further explore the role of the structure of
interactions by showing how interaction networks change the nature of the phase
transition of a well-known cellular automaton. Finally, we test a
phenomenological coarse-graining procedure for neural timeseries in different
settings, and in particular in the presence of stochastic environments. Our
results shed light on the role of the interaction network, its topological
features, and unobserved modulation in the emergence of collective patterns of
brain activity and general complex systems.

We implemented radio frequency-assisted electrostatic force microscopy
(RF-EFM) to investigate the electric field response of biaxially strained
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers (MLs), produced via hydrogen (H)-ion
irradiation. MoS2 ML, a semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide, has
recently attracted significant attention due to its promising opto-electronic
properties, further tunable by strain. Here, we take advantage of the RF
assistance to distinguish the electrostatic response of atomic scale defects,
such as sulfur vacancies or H-passivated sulfur vacancies, from that of the
intrinsic quantum capacitance of the strained ML. In addition, measurements at
fixed frequency (fRF = 300 MHz) elucidate the spatial variation of the quantum
capacitance over mesoscopic length scales, due to the local modulation of the
defect-driven n-type nature of the strained ML. Our finite-frequency
capacitance imaging technique, which is non-invasive and nanoscale, opens up
new possibilities for the investigation of frequency and spatial-dependent
phenomena, such as the electron compressibility in quantum materials, which are
difficult to measure by other methods.

Metallic states near the Mott insulator show a variety of quantum phases
including various magnetic, charge ordered states and high-temperature
superconductivity in various transition metal oxides and organic solids. The
emergence of a variety of phases and their competitions are likely intimately
associated with quantum transitions between the electron-correlation driven
Mott insulator and metals characterized by its criticality, and is related to
many central questions of condensed matter. The quantum criticality is,
however, not well understood when the transition is controlled by the bandwidth
through physical parameters such as pressure. Here, we quantitatively estimate
the universality class of the transition characterized by a comprehensive set
of critical exponents by using a variational Monte Carlo method implemented as
an open-source innovated quantum many-body solver, with the help of established
scaling laws at a typical bandwidth-controlled Mott transition. The criticality
indicates a weaker charge and density instability in contrast to the
filling-controlled transition realized by carrier doping, implying a weaker
instability to superconductivity as well. The present comprehensive
clarification opens up a number of routes for quantitative experimental studies
for complete understanding of elusive quantum Mott transition and nearby
strange metal that cultivate future design of functionality.

We present here a statistical study of the transit time required for a
magnetic domain wall to go through a small laser spot focused on 2D magnetic
thin film. The domain wall velocity deduced this way is in good agreement with
the other ways used to measure this parameter. But, the main fact is that the
transit time is not a reproducible parameter, we have observed a quite large
distribution of this parameter. This distribution can be explained assuming the
movement to occur through jumps, whose probabilities are given by a Poisson's
process. The fitting of this distribution has enabled us to get the required
number of jumps to reverse the magnetization of the small area under the laser
spot. This important parameter should lead to a better understanding of the
creep regime.

<h3>Multiple-q current states in a multicomponent superconducting channel</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuriy Yerin, Stefan-Ludwig Drechsler, Mario Cuoco, Caterina Petrillo</i>
<br>
<br>
It is well-established that multicomponent superconductors can host different
nonstandard phenomena such as broken-time reversal symmetry (BTRS) states,
exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phases, the fractional Josephson
effect as well as plenty of topological defects like phase solitons, domain
walls and unusual vortex structures. We show that in the case of a
two-component superconducting quasi-one-dimensional channel this catalogue can
be extended by a novel inhomogeneous current state, which we have termed as a
multiple-momenta state or, in short, a multiple-q state, characterized by the
coexistence of two different interpenetrating Cooper pair condensates with
different total momenta. Within the Ginzburg-Landau formalism for a dirty
two-band superconductor with sizable impurity scattering treated in the
Born-approximation we reveal that under certain conditions, the occurrence of
multiple-q states can induce a cascade of transitions involving switching
between them and the homogeneous BTRS (non-BTRS) states and vice versa leading
this way to a complex interplay of homogeneous and inhomogeneous current
states. We find that hallmarks of such a multiple-q state within a thin wire or
channel can be a saw-like dependence of the depairing current and the existence
of two distinct stable branches on it (a bistable current state).

We reversibly switch the polar environment of an individual magnetic atom
with an electric field to control the energy barrier for reversal of
magnetization. By applying an electric field in the gap between the tip and
sample of a scanning tunneling microscope, we induce bistable changes in the
polarization of the region surrounding a chlorine vacancy in a monolayer of
sodium chloride on copper terminated by a monolayer of copper nitride. The
displacement of the sodium chloride ions alters the local electric polarization
and modifies the magnetocrystalline anisotropy experienced by a single cobalt
atom. When a cobalt atom is near a chlorine vacancy, spin-sensitive inelastic
electron tunneling spectroscopy measurements can reveal the change in
anisotropy. The demonstration of atomic-scale control of magnetic properties
with electric fields opens new possibilities for probing the origins of
magnetoelectric coupling and will stimulate the development of model artificial
mutliferroic systems.

Optically dark excitons determine a wide range of properties of photoexcited
semiconductors yet are hard to access via conventional spectroscopies. Here, we
develop a time-resolved ultrafast photocurrent technique (trPC) to probe the
formation dynamics of optically dark excitons. The nonlinear nature of the trPC
makes it particularly sensitive to the formation of excitons occurring at the
femtosecond timescale after the excitation. As proof of principle, we extract
the interlayer exciton formation time 0.4~ps at 160 $\mu$J/cm$^2$ fluence in a
MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructure and show that this time decreases with
fluence. In addition, our approach provides access to the dynamics of carriers
and their interlayer transport. Overall, our work establishes trPC as a
technique to study dark excitons in various systems that are hard to probe by
other approaches.

Recent discovery of HfO2-based and nitride-based ferroelectrics that are

field of ferroelectric-based nanoelectronics. Guided by a simple design
principle of charge compensation and density functional theory calculations, we
discover HfO2-like mixed-anion materials, TaON and NbON, can crystallize in the
polar Pca21 phase with a strong thermodynamic driving force to adopt anion
ordering spontaneously. Both oxynitrides possess large remnant polarization,
low switching barriers, and unconventional negative piezoelectric effect,
making them promising piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics. Distinct from HfO2
that has a wide band gap, both TaON and NbON can absorb visible light and have
high charge carrier mobilities, suitable for ferroelectric photovoltaic and

<br>

Researchers developed chromosome capture methods such as Hi-C to better
understand DNA's 3D folding in nuclei. The Hi-C method captures contact
frequencies between DNA segment pairs across the genome. When analyzing Hi-C
data sets, it is common to group these pairs using standard bioinformatics
methods (e.g., PCA). Other approaches handle Hi-C data as weighted networks,
where connected node represent DNA segments in 3D proximity. In this
representation, one can leverage community detection techniques developed in
complex network theory to group nodes into mesoscale communities containing
similar connection patterns. While there are several successful attempts to
analyze Hi-C data in this way, it is common to report and study the most
typical community structure. But in reality, there are often several valid
candidates. Therefore, depending on algorithm design, different community
detection methods focusing on slightly different connectivity features may have
differing views on the ideal node groupings. In fact, even the same community
detection method may yield different results if using a stochastic algorithm.
This ambiguity is fundamental to community detection and shared by most complex
networks whenever interactions span all scales in the network. This is known as
community inconsistency. This paper explores this inconsistency of 3D
communities in Hi-C data for all human chromosomes. We base our analysis on two
inconsistency metrics, one local and one global, and quantify the network
scales where the community separation is most variable. For example, we find
that TADs are less reliable than A/B compartments and that nodes with highly
variable node-community memberships are associated with open chromatin.
Overall, our study provides a helpful framework for data-driven researchers and
increases awareness of some inherent challenges when clustering Hi-C data into
3D communities.

method. Historically, the preparation of GNRs depended on the quality, or
smoothness, of the surface changes during growth. The physical phenomenon of
terrace step formation introduces the risk of GNR deformation along sidewalls,
but the risk is heavily mitigated by this polymer-assisted sublimation method.
Two widths (100 nm and 50 nm) are examined electrically and optically for both
armchair and zigzag GNRs. Our electrical results support the expected behaviors
of the GNRs, while the optical signatures of variable strain reveal the subtle
differences among all the GNR species measured.

Metallic foams are crucial to many emerging applications, among them
shielding against hypervelocity impacts caused by micrometeoroids and orbital
debris. The variability of properties at feature-scale and mesoscale lengths
originating from the foam's inherently random microstructure makes predictive
models of their properties challenging. It also hinders the optimization of
components fabricated with such foams, an especially serious problem for
spacecraft design where the balance between cost and mass must also be balanced
against the catastrophic results of component failure. To address this problem,
we compute the critical transition length between the feature-scale, where
mechanical properties are determined by individual features, and the mesoscale,
where behavior is determined by ensembles of features. At the mesoscale,
distributions of properties -- with respect to both expectation value and
standard variability -- are consistent and predictable. The Kentucky Random
Structure Toolkit (KRaSTk) is applied to determine the transition from
feature-scale to mesoscale for computational volumes representing metallic
foams at a range of reduced densities. The transition is found to occur when
the side length of a cubic sample volume is ~10x greater than the
characteristic length. Comparing KRaSTk-computed converged stiffness
distributions with experimental measurements of a commercial metallic foam
found excellent agreement for both expectation value and standard variability
at all reduced densities. Lastly, we observe that the diameter of a
representative MMOD strike is ~30x shorter than the feature-scale to mesoscale
transition for the foam at any reduced density. Therefore, features will
determine response to hypervelocity impacts, rather than bulk (or even
mesoscale) structure.

The relationship between the long-range antiferromagnetic order in cuprates
and the high-temperature superconductivity in these compounds represents
unresolved, nearly four-decades long scientific problem. Because recently
discovered nickelate superconductors are crystallographical counterparts of
cuprates, many properties and difficulties into describing these compounds are
common to both families. Recently, Fowlie et al (2022 Nature Physics 18 1043)
aimed to detect the antiferromagnetic order in $R_{1-x}Sr_{x}NiO_{2}$ (R = Nd,
Pr, La, x ~ 0.2) films by using the muon spin rotation (muSR) technique. This
research group reported on the existence of short-range antiferromagnetic order
in all studied nickelates. Here, we aimed to reveal the existence of this
interaction in the same nickelate films by analyzing the temperature dependent
resistivity, $\rho(T)$, reported by the same research group. Global $\rho(T)$
data fits to the advanced Bloch-Gr\"uneisen model showed that each of
R1-xSrxNiO2 compounds can be characterized by a unique power-law exponent, p
(where p=2 for the electron-electron scattering, p=3 for the electron-magnon
scattering, and p=5 for the electron-phonon scattering), and global
characteristic temperature, $T_{\omega}$ (which has the meaning of the Debye
temperature at p=5). We found that p=2.0 in Nd- and Pr-based compounds, and
p=1.3 for La-based compound. The latter value does not have any interpretation
within established theoretical models. We also analyzed $\rho(T)$ data for
$Nd_{1-x}Sr_{x}NiO_{2}$ (0.125 < x < 0.325) reported by Lee et al (2022
arXiv2203.02580). Because our analysis showed that p-values in nickelates are
remarkably different from p=3, we call for the developent of a new theoretical
model to describe $\rho(T)$ in materials exhibiting a short-range
antiferromagnetic order.

<h3>Epitaxial growth and characterization of (001) [NiFe/M]$_{20}$ (M = Cu,  CuPt and Pt) superlattices</h3>

We present optimization of [(15 $\unicode{x212B}$) Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/(5
$\unicode{xC5}$) M]$_{20}$ single crystal multilayers on (001) MgO, with M
being Cu, Cu$_{50}$Pt$_{50}$ and Pt. These superlattices were characterized by
high-resolution X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and diffraction (XRD) as well as polar
mapping of important crystal planes. It is shown that cube on cube epitaxial
relationship can be obtained when depositing at the substrate temperature of
100 $^\circ$C regardless of the lattice mismatch (5% and 14% for Cu and Pt,
respectively). At lower substrate temperatures poly-crystalline multilayers
were obtained while at higher substrate temperatures {111} planes appear at
$\sim$10$^\circ$ off normal to the film plane. It is also shown that as the
epitaxial strain increases, the easy magnetization axis rotates towards the
direction that previously was assumed to be harder, i.e. from [110] to [100],
and eventually further increase in the strain makes the magnetic hysteresis
loops isotropic in the film plane. Higher epitaxial strain is also accompanied
with increased coercivity values. Thus, the effect of epitaxial strain on the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy is much larger than what was observed previously
in similar, but polycrystalline samples with uniaxial anisotropy (Kateb et al.
2021).

<h3>Compact expansion of a repulsive suspension</h3>

We find that a suspension of particles that mutually repel by short-ranged
interactions spreads compactly. Unlike the diffusive boundary of a spreading
drop of Brownian particles, here, the density is strictly zero beyond a cutoff
distance. We identify that the drop expands in a self-similar fashion in the
dense limit. Starting from the pair potential, we show that in the continuum
limit, the suspension's expansion follows a nonlinear diffusion equation. At
early times (dense limit), the density profile is parabolic, and the area of
the ensemble grows as the square root of time. At later times (sparse limit),
the dynamics slow down and transition to a logarithmic growth. We verify the
approximations of the analytical predictions in the dense regime using exact
numerical integration. We examine the dilute regime by monitoring the expansion
of a charged stabilized colloidal suspension and find the logarithmic expansion
is consistent with the experiment. Using molecular dynamics simulation of
thousands of particles, we see the crossover between the two regimes as the
dynamics transition from self-similar to logarithmic.

<h3>Spectroscopic studies of the superconducting gap in the 12442 family of  iron-based compounds</h3>

The iron-based compounds of the so-called 12442 family are very peculiar in
various respects. They originate from the intergrowth of 122 and 1111 building
blocks, display a large in-plane vs. out-of-plane anisotropy, possess double
layers of FeAs separated by insulating layers, and are generally very similar
to double-layer cuprates. Moreover, they are stoichiometric superconductors
because of an intrinsic hole doping. Establishing their superconducting
properties, and in particular the symmetry of the order parameter, is thus
particularly relevant in order to understand to what extent these compounds can
be considered as the iron-based counterpart of cuprates. In this work we review
the results of various techniques from the current literature and compare them
with ours, obtained in Rb-12442 by combining point-contact Andreev-reflection
spectroscopy and coplanar waveguide resonator measurements of the superfluid
density. It turns out that the compound possesses at least two gaps, one of
which is certainly nodal. The compatibility of this result with the
theoretically allowed gap structures, as well as with the other results in
literature, is discussed in detail.

An intrinsic drift-velocity limit of quantum Hall effect is the collective
magneto-exciton (ME) instability. It has been demonstrated in bilayer graphene
(BLG) using noise measurements. We reproduce this experiment in single-layer
graphene (SLG), and show that the same mechanism carries a direct relativistic
signature on the breakdown velocity. Based on theoretical calculations of SLG-
and BLG-ME spectra, we show that Doppler-effect induced instabilities take
place at a phase-velocity given by a fixed value of the ME conductivity, set by
the Hall conductance.

<h3>Current-voltage characteristics of the N-I-PT-symmetric non-Hermitian  superconductor junction as a probe of non-Hermitian formalisms</h3>

We study theoretically a junction consisting of a normal metal, PT-symmetric
non-Hermitian superconductor, and an insulating thin layer between them. We
calculate current-voltage characteristics for this junction using left-right
and right-right bases and compare the results. We find that left-right basis
gives the opposite current of Andreev-scattered particles compared to the
right-right basis and conventional Andreev scattering. This leads to profound
differences in current-voltage characteristics. Based on this and other
signatures, we argue that left-right basis is not applicable in this case.
Remarkably, we find that the quasiparticle current is conserved across the
junction in both bases, and the growth and decay with time of the states with
imaginary energies in right-right basis is equilibrated.

<h3>Electrostatic effect due to patch potentials between closely spaced  surfaces</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spatial variation and temporal variation in surface potential are
important error sources in various precision experiments and deserved to be
considered carefully. In the former case, the theoretical analysis shows that
this effect depends on the surface potentials through their spatial
autocorrelation functions. By making some modification to the quasi-local
correlation model, we obtain a rigorous formula for the patch force, where the
magnitude is proportional to ${\frac{1}{{{a}^{2}}}{{(\frac{a}{w})}^{\beta
(a/w)+2}}}$ with ${a}$ the distance between two parallel plates, ${w}$ the mean
patch size, and ${\beta}$ the scaling coefficient from ${-2}$ to ${-4}$. A
torsion balance experiment is then conducted, and obtain a 0.4 mm effective
patch size and 20 mV potential variance. In the latter case, we apply an adatom
diffusion model to describe this mechanism and predicts a ${f^{-3/4}}$
frequency dependence above 0.01 ${\rm mHz}$. This prediction meets well with a
typical experimental results. Finally, we apply these models to analyze the
patch effect for two typical experiments. Our analysis will help to investigate
the properties of surface potentials.

<h3>Discovery of Orbital Ordering in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</h3>

The primordial ingredient of cuprate superconductivity is the CuO$_2$ unit
cell. Here, theoretical attention usually concentrates on the intra-atom
Coulombic interactions dominating the $3d^9$ and $3d^{10}$ configurations of
each copper ion. However, if Coulombic interactions also occur between
electrons of the $2p^6$ orbitals of each planar oxygen atom, spontaneous
orbital ordering may lift their energy degeneracy. This long predicted
intra-unit cell symmetry breaking should then generate an orbital ordered
phase, for which the charge-transfer energy $\varepsilon$ separating the $2p^6$
and 3d$^{10}$ orbitals is distinct for the two oxygen atoms. Here we introduce
sublattice resolved $\varepsilon(r)$ imaging techniques to CuO$_2$ studies and
discover powerful intra-unit-cell rotational symmetry breaking of
$\varepsilon(r)$, with energy-level splitting between the two oxygen atoms on
the 50 meV scale. Spatially, this state is arranged in Ising domains of
orthogonally oriented orbital order that appear bounded by dopant ions, and
within whose domain walls low energy electronic quadrupolar two-level systems
occur. Overall, these data reveal a $Q=0$ orbitally ordered state that lifts
the energy degeneracy of $p_x/p_y$ oxygen orbitals at separate CuO$_2$ oxygen
sites, in striking analogy to the ordering of $d_{zx}/d_{zy}$ iron orbitals of
the iron-based superconductors.

<h3>How closely does transient magnetic linear dichroism follow the spin  moment?</h3>

<br>
<br>
In highly out-of-equilibrium states of matter, such as those induced by a
pump laser, the applicability of well established spectroscopic probes of
magnetic order are called into question. Here we address the validity of
magnetic linear dichroism (MLD), a crucial probe of antiferromagnetic order, in
pump laser conditions. Employing state-of-the-art time-dependent
density-functional theory we compute the dynamics of the square of the spin
moment and compare it to that derived spectroscopically via the L3-edge MLD
response in two contrasting materials, ferromagnetic FePt and antiferromagnetic
FePd. For the latter material the agreement between these distinct routes to
the magnetic moment severely degrades for pulse fluences greater than
$\sim1$mJ/cm$^2$ -- with errors exceeding a 50\% underestimated of moment --
indicating a breakdown of the MLD response as a probe of magnetic order. This
contrasts with ferromagnetic FePt for which L3 edge MLD reliably tracks
magnetism over a broad range of fluences. We attribute this to the increased
loss of $d$-moment to delocalized states under laser pump conditions in an
antiferromagnetic environment, and propose that this represents a finding that
holds generally for antiferromagnetic materials.
