<h3>Knowledge-Reuse Transfer Learning Methods in Molecular and Material  Science</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12982" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12982</a>

</p><i>An Chen, Zhilong Wang, Karl Luigi Loza Vidaurre, Yanqiang Han, Simin Ye, Kehao Tao, Shiwei Wang, Jing Gao, Jinjin Li</i>
<p>Molecules and materials are the foundation for the development of modern
advanced industries such as energy storage systems and semiconductor devices.
However, traditional trial-and-error methods or theoretical calculations are
highly resource-intensive, and extremely long R&D (Research and Development)
periods cannot meet the urgent need for molecules/materials in industrial
development. Machine learning (ML) methods based on big data are expected to
break this dilemma. However, the difficulty in constructing large-scale
datasets of new molecules/materials due to the high cost of data acquisition
and annotation limits the development of machine learning. The application of
transfer learning lowers the data requirements for model training, which makes
transfer learning stand out in researches addressing data quality issues. In
this review, we summarize recent advances in transfer learning related to
molecular and materials science. We focus on the application of transfer
learning methods for the discovery of advanced molecules/materials,
particularly, the construction of transfer learning frameworks for different
systems, and how transfer learning can enhance the performance of models. In
addition, the challenges of transfer learning are also discussed.

<h3>Percolation, fractals and the critical point in a nuclear reactor</h3>

</p><i>V. V. Ryazanov</i>
<p>The trajectories of neutrons in the reactor, the points of their fission of
uranium nuclei, the points of neutron absorption, fission chains and chain
reactions are considered from the standpoint of fractal geometry and
percolation theory. In the study of the stationary critical operating mode of a
nuclear reactor, models of Cayley trees and Laplacian fractals are used. This
approach allows us to obtain the neutron multiplication equation and an
expression for the critical size of the reactor. Models of irreversible growth
and various fractal dimensions are also considered as applied to the evolution
of neutrons in a reactor. Prospects for the development of the proposed
approach to describing reactors, primarily the kinetics and processes of
neutron transfer, are indicated.

<h3>Syntropy in complex systems: A complement to Shannon's Entropy</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13022" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13022</a>
<br>
</p><i>Santiago Mendez-Moreno</i>
<p>This study introduces the syntropy function ($S_N$) and expectancy function
($E_N$), derived from the novel function $\phi$, to provide a refined
perspective on complexity, extending beyond conventional entropy analysis.
$S_N$ is designed to detect localized coherent events, whereas $E_N$
encapsulates expected system behaviors, offering a comprehensive framework for
understanding system dynamics. The manuscript explores essential theorems and
properties, underscoring their theoretical and practical implications. Future
research will further elucidate their roles, particularly in biological signals
and dynamic systems, suggesting a deep interplay between order and chaos.

<h3>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi  Hubbard model through static correlations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sayantan Roy, Sameed Pervaiz, Thereza Paiva, Nandini Trivedi</i>
<p>Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting
condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique
has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon
correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify
the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic
system. Toward this end, we report a determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi
Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength
and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U
(band regime) to large U (correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are:
(1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is
accompanied by the appearance of tem-perature insensitive points in the
equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band
regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon
correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density
correlation to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior
in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation
functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, at both and away
from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation
functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental
investigations

<h3>Ultrafast pseudomagnetic fields from electron-nuclear quantum geometry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13070" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13070</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lennart Klebl, Arne Schobert, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Alexander V. Balatsky, Tim O. Wehling</i>
<p>Recent experiments demonstrate precise control over coherently excited phonon
modes using high-intensity terahertz lasers, opening new pathways towards
dynamical, ultrafast design of magnetism in functional materials. In this work,
we put forward a coupling mechanism based on electron-nuclear quantum geometry.
This effect is rooted in the phase accumulation of the electronic wavefunction
under a circular evolution of nuclear coordinates. An excitation pulse then
induces a transient level splitting between electronic orbitals that carry
angular momentum. When converted to effective magnetic fields, values on the
order of tens of Teslas are easily reached.

<h3>A detailed field theory for RNA-like molecules with periodic base  sequence</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13100" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13100</a>
<br>
</p><i>Richard Dengler</i>
<p>This work examines a field theory for RNA-like molecules in a good solvent.
The field theory is based on a lattice model for single- and double-strand RNA
with a periodic base sequence, and otherwise contains all known relevant
details (polymer types, polymer lengths and interactions). As for the somewhat
less explicit $O\left(n\right)$-symmetric model there is a close relation to
the conventional one-component branched polymer and the associated Lee-Yang
problem. We further elucidate this relation. We derive exact results in the
limiting cases of nearly complete denaturation and nearly complete
renaturation. The single-strand critical exponent $\nu_{\varphi}$ is calculated
in two-loop order.

<h3>Predicted Complex Lithium Phases at Terapascal Pressures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13137" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13137</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jack Whaley-Baldwin, Miguel Martinez-Canales, Chris J. Pickard</i>
<p>We investigate the pressure-temperature ($p$-$T$) phase diagram of elemental
lithium (Li) up to multiterapascal (TPa) pressures using ab-initio random
structure search (AIRSS) and density functional theory (DFT). At zero
temperature, beyond the high-pressure $Fd\bar{3}m$ diamond structure predicted
in previous studies, we find eleven solid-state phase transitions to structures
of greatly varying complexity, in addition to two structures that we calculate
will become stable with sufficient temperature. The full $p$-$T$ dependence of
the phase boundaries are computed within the vibrational harmonic
approximation, and the solid-liquid melting line is calculated using ab-initio
molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, between 39.1 TPa and 55.7 TPa, Li
adopts an elaborate monoclinic structure with 46 atoms in the primitive unit
cell, and between 71.9 TPa and $103$ TPa, an incommensurate host-guest phase of
the Ba-IV type. We find that Li, hitherto predicted to be an electride at TPa
pressures, abruptly loses its electride character above 16 TPa, reverting back
to normal metallic behaviour with a corresponding rise in the Fermi-level
electronic density of states (eDOS) and broadening of the electronic bands.

<h3>Escape into the Third Dimension in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13152</a>
<br>
</p><i>Joseph Pollard, Gareth P. Alexander</i>
<p>Integer winding disclinations are unstable in a nematic and are removed by an
`escape into the third dimension', resulting in a non-singular texture. This
process is frustrated in a cholesteric material due to the requirement of
maintaining a uniform handedness and instead results in the formation of
strings of point defects, as well as complex three-dimensional solitons such as
heliknotons that consist of linked dislocations. We give a complete description
of this frustration using methods of contact topology. Furthermore, we describe
how this frustration can be exploited to stabilise regions of the material
where the handedness differs from the preferred handedness. These `twist
solitons' are stable in numerical simulation and are a new form of topological
defect in cholesteric materials that have not previously been studied.

<h3>Vison condensation and spinon confinement in a kagome lattice  $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid: A numerical study of a quantum dimer model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13154</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kyusung Hwang</i>
<p>Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range
entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of
spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena
of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer
model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid
($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The
transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially
leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact
diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation
using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting
on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological
degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison
condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by
investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state
that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the
origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic
limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer
model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by
providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon
confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.

<h3>Magnetoelectric coupling at the domain level in polycrystalline ErMnO3</h3>

</p><i>J. Schultheiß, L. Puntigam, M. Winkler, S. Krohns, D. Meier, H. Das, D. M. Evans, I. Kézsmárki</i>
<p>We explore the impact of a magnetic field on the ferroelectric domain pattern
in polycrystalline hexagonal ErMnO3 at cryogenic temperatures. Utilizing
piezoelectric force microscopy measurements at 1.65 K, we observe modifications
of the topologically protected ferroelectric domain structure induced by the
magnetic field. These alterations likely result from strain induced by the
magnetic field, facilitated by intergranular coupling in polycrystalline
multiferroics. Our findings give insights into the interplay between electric
and magnetic properties at the local scale and represent a so far unexplored
pathway for manipulating topologically protected ferroelectric vortex patterns
in hexagonal manganites.

<h3>The trimer paradox: the effect of stiff constraints on equilibrium  distributions in overdamped dynamics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13185" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13185</a>
<br>
</p><i>Radost Waszkiewicz, Maciej Lisicki</i>
<p>We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian
particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability
distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite
stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman is
missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand. In
our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly
from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a
computationally feasible method of calculation of the shape term and
demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.

<h3>Superconducting transition temperatures of pure vanadium and  vanadium-titanium alloys in the presence of dynamical electronic correlations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13202" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13202</a>
<br>
</p><i>D. Jones, A. Östlin, A. Weh, F. Beiuseanu, U. Eckern, L. Vitos, L. Chioncel</i>
<p>Ordinary superconductors are widely assumed insensitive to small
concentrations of random nonmagnetic impurities, whereas strong disorder
suppresses superconductivity, ultimately leading to a superconductor-insulator
transition. In between these limiting cases, a most fascinating regime may
emerge where disorder enhances superconductivity. This effect is discussed here
for the $\beta$-phase of vanadium-titanium alloys. Disorder is modeled using
the coherent potential approximation while local electronic interactions are
treated using dynamical mean-field theory. The McMillan formula is employed to
estimate the superconducting transition temperature, showing a maximum at a Ti
concentration of around $0.33$ for a local Coulomb interaction $U$ in the range
of $2$ to $3$ eV. Our calculations quantitatively agree with the experimentally
observed concentration dependent increase of $T_c$, and its maximal value of
about $20\%$.

<h3>Transmission across a ribbon containing a square PT impurity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13217</a>
<br>
</p><i>Cristian Mejía-Cortés, Mario I. Molina</i>
<p>We study the spectrum and transmission coefficient of plane waves propagating
along square ribbons of varying widths, containing a square-shaped,
PT-symmetric impurity region. We start with a zero-width ribbon (1D chain) and
place a PT symmetric dimer. The spectrum is computed numerically and the
instability gain is computed as a function of the gain/loss dimer strength. The
transmission coefficient is obtained in closed form and examined as a function
of wavevector and the gain/loss parameter. Next, we study a ribbon in a narrow
ladder configuration containing a square PT impurity. As before, we compute the
instability gain numerically and the transmission coefficient in closed form
for the two possible input modes. Finally, we repeat the calculations for a
wider ladder ribbon containing a Lieb-like impurity in a PT configuration. For
all cases and transmission channels, we obtain transmission divergences in
wavevector-gain/loss parameter space, whose number increases with the width of
the ribbon

<p>A new perovskite KOsO3 has been stabilized under high-pressure and high
temperature conditions. It is cubic at 500 K (Pm-3m) and undergoes subsequent
phase transitions to tetragonal at 320 K (P4/mmm) and rhombohedral (R-3m) at
230 K as shown from refining synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRD) data.
The larger orbital overlap integral and the extended wavefunction of 5d
electrons in the perovskite KOsO3 allow to explore physics from the regime
where Mott and Hund's rule couplings dominate to the state where the multiple
interactions are on equal footing. We demonstrate an exotic magnetic ordering
phase found by neutron powder diffraction along with physical properties via a
suite of measurements including magnetic and transport properties, differential
scanning calorimetry, and specific heat, which provide comprehensive
information for a system at the crossover from localized to itinerant
electronic behavior.

<h3>A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Predicting Energetics of  Interacting Defects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13243" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13243</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hao Yu</i>
<p>Interacting defect systems are ubiquitous in materials under realistic
scenarios, yet gaining an atomic-level understanding of these systems from a
computational perspective is challenging - it often demands substantial
resources due to the necessity of employing supercell calculations. While
machine learning techniques have shown potential in accelerating materials
simulations, their application to systems involving interacting defects remains
relatively rare. In this work, we present a comparative study of three
different methods to predict the free energy change of systems with interacting
defects. We leveraging a limited dataset from Density Functional Theory(DFT)
calculations to assess the performance models using materials descriptors,
graph neural networks and cluster expansion. Our findings indicate that the
cluster expansion model can achieve precise energetics predictions even with
this limited dataset. Furthermore, with synthetic data generate from cluster
expansion model at near-DFT levels, we obtained enlarged dataset to assess the
demands on data for training accurate prediction models using graph neural
networks for systems featuring interacting defects. A brief discussion of the
computational cost for each method is provided at the end. This research
provide a preliminary evaluation of applying machine learning techniques in
imperfect surface systems.

<h3>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene  bilayer</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yu-Hao Shen, Jun-Ding Zheng, Wen-Yi Tong, Chun-Gang Duan</i>
<p>With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there
breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B
sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In
consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological
gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As
long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge
states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT
symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model
calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum
valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that
leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ).
The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK -
CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase
transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the
layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van
der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K
bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a
small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design
in topological valleytronics and twistronics.

<h3>Interaction-Induced Dimensional Crossover through Full 3D to 1D</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13295" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13295</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tao Yu, Xiaoran Ye, Zhaoxin Liang</i>
<p>The exploration of dimensional crossover carries profound fundamental
significance, serving as a crucial bridge in comprehending the remarkable
disparities observed in transitional phenomena across the two distinct
dimensions of a physical system. The prevalent strategy for manipulating the
dimensionality involves meticulously controlling the external trapping
geometry, thereby restricting the degrees of freedom of the kinetic energy from
three-dimensional (3D) to lower-dimensional spaces, while maintaining the 3D
nature of the interaction energy degrees of freedom. The aim of this work is to
introduce an innovative scenario to achieve dimensional crossover,
characterized by lower-D nature of both the kinetic and the interaction energy
degrees of freedom. To accomplish this objective, we delve deeply into the
realm of a 2D optically trapped Bose gas, focusing specifically on its
finite-range interaction. Our emphasis lies in exploring the lattice-induced
dimensional crossover from full 3D to 1D in both kinetic and interaction terms.
Utilizing the functional path integral method, we derive the equation of states
of the model system, encompassing crucial quantities such as the ground state
energy and quantum depletion. These equations enable us to analyze the combined
effects of finite range interaction and an optical lattice on quantum
fluctuations of the BEC system. Notably, our analytical findings reconcile the
Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the ground state energy in 3D and
Lieb-Liniger (LL) ones in 1D limit, thereby providing fresh insights into the
intriguing disparities between LHY and LL corrections.

<h3>Thermal Hall effect driven by phonon-magnon hybridization in a honeycomb  antiferromagnet</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13306</a>
<br>
</p><i>Qingkai Meng, Xiaokang Li, Lingxiao Zhao, Chao Dong, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia</i>
<p>The underlying mechanism of the thermal Hall effect (THE) generated by
phonons in a variety of insulators is yet to be identified. Here, we report on
a sizeable thermal Hall conductivity in NiPS$_3$, a van de Waals stack of
honeycomb layers with a zigzag antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 155 K. The
longitudinal ($\kappa_{aa}$) and the transverse ($\kappa_{ab}$) thermal
conductivities peak at the same temperature and the thermal Hall angle
($\kappa_{ab}/\kappa_{aa}/B$) respects a previously identified bound. The
amplitude of $\kappa_{ab}$ is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of
magnetization along the $b$-axis, in contrast to the phonon mean free path,
which is not at all. We show that the magnon and acoustic phonon bands cross
each other along the $b^\ast$ orientation in the momentum space. The
exponential temperature dependence of $\kappa_{ab}$ above its peak reveals an
energy scale on the order of magnitude of the gap expected to be opened by
magnon-phonon hybridization. This points to an intrinsic scenario for THE with
possible relevance to other magnetic insulators.

</p><i>Rikuya Ishikawa, Kyohei Takae, Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Rei Kurita</i>
<p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are attracting attention due to their exceptional
properties, such as enhanced mechanical toughness, superconducting robustness,
and thermoelectric performance. Numerous HEAs have been developed for diverse
applications, ranging from self-healing in fusion reactors to addressing
environmental concerns with thermoelectric materials. Understanding atomic
diffusion within HEA crystals is crucial for these applications. Here, this
study investigates diffusion mechanisms in PbTe-based HEAs, focusing on the
role of indium (In). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that In inclusion
prompts spontaneous Frenkel defect formation, notably enhancing diffusion not
only of In$^+$ but also other cations. Frenkel defect formation, closely linked
to alloy properties, is predominantly influenced by charge rather than cation
size. This insight not only enhances comprehension of HEA diffusion mechanisms
but also develops HEAs with properties such as self-healing from damage and
high ion permeability, advancing the field of material science.

<p>We investigate the influence of hydrogen on the electronic structure of a
binary transition metallic glass of V$_{80}$Zr$_{20}$. We examine the
hybridization between the hydrogen and metal atoms with the aid of hard x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Combined with ab initio density functional theory,
we are able to show and predict the formation of $s$-$d$ hybridized energy
states. With optical transmission and resistivity measurements, we investigate
the emergent electronic properties formed out of those altered energy states,
and together with the theoretical calculations of the frequency-dependent
conductivity tensor, we qualitatively support the observed strong
wavelength-dependency of the hydrogen-induced changes on the optical absorption
and a positive parabolic change in resistivity with hydrogen concentration.

<p>The semimetal quantum well (QW) based on HgTe structures exhibiting unusual
transport properties at low temperature is examined experimentally. It
demonstrates either a linear or quadratic growth of resistance with temperature
at different top-gate voltages in the semimetal regime. We develop a
theoretical model of HgTe-based semimetal QW resistance temperature dependence
based on electron-hole scattering processes at low temperatures. We apply the
Boltzmann transport equation approach to study the effect of electron-hole
scattering in a semimetal QW. The calculated temperature behavior of 2D
semimetal resistivity demonstrates an excellent agreement with experimental
findings.

<h3>Observation of non-volatile anomalous Nernst effect in altermagnet with  collinear Néel vector</h3>

<p>Anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), a widely investigated transverse
thermoelectric effect that converts waste heat into electrical energy with
remarkable flexibility and integration capability, has been extended to
antiferromagnets with non-collinear spin texture recently. ANE in compensated
magnet with collinear N\'eel vector will bring more opportunities to construct
magnetic-field-immune and ultrafast transverse thermoelectric converters, but
remains unachieved for long. It is due to the degenerated band structure of
traditional collinear compensated magnet excludes non-zero Berry curvature.
Here, we realize non-volatile ANE in altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film with
collinear Neel vector, whose unique alternating spin-splitting band structure
plays vital role in creating non-zero Berry curvature and hotpots of anomalous
Nernst conductivity near band intersections. Interestingly, ANE is relatively
weak in stoichiometric Mn5Si3, but undergoes a sixfold enhancement through
strategically raising the Fermi level by additional Mn doping, indicating
sensitive intrinsic influence from specific location of the Fermi level on ANE
in altermagnet. Moreover, our investigation reveals a unique
Neel-vector-dependent temperature-scaling relationship of anomalous Nernst
conductivity in Mn5Si3. Our work not only fills a longstanding gap by
confirming the presence of non-volatile ANE in collinear compensated magnet,
but also enlightens thermoelectric physics related to exotic spin-splitting
band structure in altermagnet.

mechanical proper-ties in the C15 CaAl2 Laves phase were investigated in two
off-stoichiometric compositions with 5.7 at.-% Mg addition (Ca33Al61Mg6) and
10.8 at.-% Mg and 3.0 at.-% Ca addition (Ca36Al53Mg11) and compared to the
stoichiometric (Ca33Al67) composition. Cubic Ca-Al-Mg Laves phases with
multiple crystallographic orientations were characterised and deformed using
nanoindentation. The hardness and indentation modulus were measured to be 4.1
+- 0.3 GPa and 71.3 +- 1.5 GPa for Ca36Al53Mg11, 4.6 +- 0.2 GPa and 80.4 +- 3.8
GPa for Ca33Al61Mg6 and 4.9 +- 0.3 GPa and 85.5 +- 4.0 GPa for Ca33Al67,
respectively. The resulting surface traces as well as slip and crack planes,
were distinguished on the indentation surfac-es, revealing the activation of
several different {11n} slip systems, as further confirmed by conventional
transmission electron microscopic observations. Additionally, the deformation
mechanisms and corresponding energy barriers of activated slip systems were
evaluated by atomistic simulations.

<p>Atomically thin heterostructures formed by twisted transition metal
dichalcogenides can be used to create periodic moir\'e patterns. The emerging
moir\'e potential can trap interlayer excitons into arrays of strongly
interacting bosons, which form a unique platform to study strongly correlated
many-body states. In order to create and manipulate these exotic phases of
matter, a microscopic understanding of exciton-exciton interactions and their
manifestation in these systems becomes indispensable. Recent density-dependent
photoluminescence (PL) measurements have revealed novel spectral features
indicating the formation of trapped multi-exciton states providing important
information about the interaction strength. In this work, we develop a
microscopic theory to model the PL spectrum of trapped multi-exciton complexes
focusing on the emission from moir\'e trapped single- and biexcitons. Based on
an excitonic Hamiltonian we determine the properties of trapped biexcitons as
function of twist angle and use these insights to predict the luminescence
spectrum of moir\'e excitons for different densities. We demonstrate how side
peaks resulting from transitions to excited states and a life time analysis can
be utilized as indicators for moir\'e trapped biexcitons and provide crucial
information about the excitonic interaction strength.

<h3>On unitary time evolution out of equilibrium</h3>

</p><i>Gesualdo Delfino, Marianna Sorba</i>
<p>We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve
with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep
generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show
how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of
the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates.
We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions
oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how,
in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies
and reproduces that known perturbatively.

<p>Spintronic nano-oscillators can generate tunable microwave signals that find
a wide range of applications in the field of telecommunication to modern
neuromorphic computing systems. Among other spintronic devices, a magnetic
skyrmion is a promising candidate for the next generation of low-power devices
due to its small size and topological stability. In this work, we propose a
multi-channel oscillator design based on the synthetic anti-ferromagnetic (SAF)
skyrmion pair. The mitigation of the skyrmion Hall effect in SAF and the
associated decimation of the Magnus force endows the proposed oscillator with
an ultra-high frequency of 41GHz and a multi-channel frequency output driven by
the same current. The ultrahigh operational frequency represents an $\sim$342
times improvement compared to the monolayer single skyrmion oscillator
featuring a constant uniaxial anisotropy profile. Using micromagnetic
simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed multi-channel
oscillator design by introducing multi-channel nanotracks along with multiple
skyrmions for enhanced frequency operation. The ultrahigh operational frequency
and multi-channel output are attributed to three key factors: The oscillator
design accounting for a finite spin-flip length of the spacer (such as Ru)
material, tangential velocity proportionality on input spin current along with
weak dependence on the radius of rotation of the skyrmion-pair, skyrmion
interlocking in the channel enabled by the multi-channel high Ku rings and
skyrmion-skyrmion repulsion, therefore resulting ultrahigh frequency and
multi-channel outputs.

<p>Magnetic gels with embedded micro/nano-sized magnetic particles in
crosslinked polymer networks can be actuated by external magnetic fields, with
changes in their internal microscopic structures and macroscopic mechanical
properties. We investigate the responses of such magnetic gels to an external
magnetic field, by means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We
find that the dynamics of magnetic particles are determined by the interplay of
between magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, polymer elasticity and thermal
fluctuations. The corresponding microscopic structures formed by the magnetic
particles such as elongated chains can be controlled by the external magnetic
field. Furthermore, the magnetic gels can exhibit reinforced macroscopic
mechanical properties, where the elastic modulus increases algebraically with
the magnetic moments of the particles in the form of
$\propto(m-m_{\mathrm{c}})^{2}$ when magnetic chains are formed. This
simulation work can not only serve as a tool for studying the microscopic and
the macroscopic responses of the magnetic gels, but also facilitate future
fabrications and practical controls of magnetic composites with desired
physical properties.

<p>We employed a machine-learning assisted approach to search for
superconducting hydrides under ambient pressure within an extensive dataset
comprising over 150 000 compounds. Our investigation yielded around 50 systems
with transition temperatures surpassing 20 K, and some even reaching above 70
K. These compounds have very different crystal structures, with different
dimensionality, chemical composition, stoichiometry, and arrangement of the
hydrogens. Interestingly, most of these systems displayed slight thermodynamic
instability, implying that their synthesis would require conditions beyond
ambient equilibrium. Moreover, we found a consistent chemical composition in
the majority of these systems, which combines alkali or alkali-earth elements
with noble metals. This observation suggests a promising avenue for future
experimental investigations into high-temperature superconductivity within
hydrides at ambient pressure.

<p>Integrating light emitters based on III-V materials with silicon-based
electronics is crucial for further increase in data transfer rates in
communication systems since the indirect bandgap of silicon prevents its direct
use as a light source. We investigate here InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dot (QD)
structures grown directly on 5{\deg} off-cut Si substrate and emitting light at
1.5 micrometers, compatible with established telecom platform. Using different
dislocation defects filtering layers, exploiting strained superlattices and
supplementary QD layers, we mitigate the effects of lattice constant and
thermal expansion mismatches between III-V materials and Si during growth.
Complementary optical spectroscopy techniques, i.e. photoreflectance and
temperature-, time- and polarization- resolved photoluminescence, allow us to
determine the optical quality and application potential of the obtained
structures by comparing them to a reference sample -- state-of-the-art QDs
grown on InP. Experimental findings are supported by calculations of excitonic
states and optical transitions by combining multiband k.p and
configuration-interaction methods. We show that our design of structures
prevents the generation of a considerable density of defects, as intended. The
emission of Si-based structures appears to be much broader than for the
reference dots, due to the creation of different QD populations which might be
a disadvantage in particular laser applications, however, could be favourable
for others, e.g. in broadly tunable devices, sensors, or optical amplifiers.
Eventually, we identify the overall most promising combination of defect
filtering layers, discuss its advantages and limitations, and prospects for
further improvements.

<p>The hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) in non-Hermitian systems exhibits
both the skin effect and topological protection, offering a novel mechanism for
the localization of topological edge states (TESs) in electrons, circuits, and
photons. However, it remains unclear whether the HSTE can be realized in
quasicrystals, and the unique structure of quasicrystals with multi-site cells
may provide novel localization phenomena for TESs induced by the HSTE. We
propose an eight-site cell in two-dimensional quasicrystals and realize the
HSTE with eight-site nonreciprocal intracell hoppings. Furthermore, we can
arbitrarily adjust the eigenfield distributions of the TESs and discover domain
walls associated with effective dissipation and their correlation with
localization. We present a new scheme to precisely adjust the energy
distribution in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with arbitrary polygonal outer
boundaries.

the heat current in terms of non-equilibrium Green functions for the junction
coupled in series or in parallel with two environmental impedances at different
temperatures. We show that even on the insulating side of the Schmid transition
the heat current is sensitive to the Josephson coupling exhibiting an opposite
behavior for the series and parallel connection and in qualitative agreement
with experiments. We also predict that this device should exhibit heat
rectification properties and provide simple expressions to account for them in

<p>Beyond-Moore computing technologies are expected to provide a sustainable
alternative to the von Neumann approach not only due to their down-scaling
potential but also via exploiting device-level functional complexity at the
lowest possible energy consumption. The dynamics of the Mott transition in
correlated electron oxides, such as vanadium dioxide, has been identified as a
rich and reliable source of such functional complexity. However, its full
potential in high-speed and low-power operation has been largely unexplored. We
fabricated nanoscale VO$_{2}$ devices embedded in a broad-band test circuit to
study the speed and energy limitations of their resistive switching operation.
Our picosecond time-resolution, real-time resistive switching experiments and
numerical simulations demonstrate that tunable low-resistance states can be set
by the application of 20~ps long, $<$1.7~V amplitude voltage pulses at 15~ps
incubation times and switching energies starting from a few femtojoule.
Moreover, we demonstrate that at nanometer-scale device sizes not only the
electric field induced insulator-to-metal transition, but also the thermal
conduction limited metal-to-insulator transition can take place at timescales
of 100's of picoseconds. These orders of magnitude breakthroughs open the route
to the design of high-speed and low-power dynamical circuits for a plethora of
neuromorphic computing applications from pattern recognition to numerical
optimization.

<br>
</p><i>Himanshu Murari, Swati Shaw, Subhradip Ghosh</i>
<p>Surface and strain engineering are among the cheaper ways to modulate
structure property relations in materials. Due to their compositional
flexibilities, MXenes, the family of two-dimensional materials, provide enough
opportunity for surface engineering. In this work, we have explored the
possibility of improving thermoelectric efficiency of MXenes through these
routes. The Janus MXenes obtained by modifications of the transition metal
constituents and the functional groups passivating their surfaces are
considered as surface engineered materials on which bi-axial strain is applied
in a systematic way. We find that in the three Janus compounds Zr$_{2}$COS,
ZrHfO$_{2}$ and ZrHfCOS, tensile strain modifies the electronic and lattice
thermoelectric parameters such that the thermoelectric efficiency can be
maximised. A remarkable reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity due to
increased anharmonicity and elevation in Seebeck coefficient are obtained by
application of moderate tensile strain. With the help of first-principles
electronic structure method and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory we
analyse the interplay of structural parameters, electronic and dynamical
properties to understand the effects of strain and surface modifications on
thermoelectric properties of these systems. Our detailed calculations and in
depth analysis lead not only to the microscopic understanding of the influences
of surface and strain engineering in these three systems, but also provide
enough insights for adopting this approach and improve thermoelectric
efficiencies in similar systems.

<p>At zero temperature, a Josephson junction coupled to an ohmic environment
displays a quantum phase transition between superconducting and insulating
phases, depending whether the resistance of the environment is below or above
the resistance quantum. At finite temperature, this so-called Schmid transition
turns into a crossover. We determine the conditions under which the temperature
dependence of the thermal conductance, which characterizes heat flow from a hot
to cold resistor across the Josephson junction, displays universal scaling
characteristic of the Schmid transition. We also discuss conditions for heat
rectification to happen in the circuit. Our work can serve as a guide for
identifying signatures of the Schmid transition in heat transport experiments.

<p>Neutron reflectometry is a critical tool for investigating the structure of
thin films and interfaces. However, the misapplication of the Born
approximation to reflection geometry leads some to assume that the minimum
thickness that may be probed by neutron reflectometry is limited by the Q-range
of the measurement. In this study, we use model-dependent analysis, multiple
isotopic contrasts, and magnetic spin states, to show that it is possible to
resolve structures significantly smaller than this perceived limit. To quantify
this "analytical resolution", we employ Bayesian model selection, offering a
robust and quantifiable comparison between different analytical models. We
believe that this work offers pivotal insights for the analysis of neutron
reflectometry and hope that it will contribute to more accurate and
information-rich analyses in the future.

<h3>Bosonic Functional Determinant Approach and its Application to Polaron  Spectra</h3>

</p><i>Moritz Drescher, Manfred Salmhofer, Tilman Enss</i>
<p>The functional determinant approach (FDA) is a simple method to compute
exactly certain observables for ideal quantum systems and has been successfully
applied to the Fermi polaron problem to obtain the dynamical overlap and
spectral function. Unfortunately, its application to Bosonic ultracold gases is
prohibited by the failure of the grand canonical ensemble for these systems. In
this paper, we show how to circumvent this problem and develop a Bosonic FDA.
This yields exact injection and ejection spectra for ideal Bose polarons at
arbitrary temperatures. While coherent features visible at absolute zero
quickly smear out with rising temperature as expected, the line width of the
main peak is, counterintuitively, found to decrease near unitarity. We compare
the results to the Fermi polaron problem, for which we provide more detailed
spectra than previously available by deriving an explicit formula for the
overlap operator.

<p>Growth parameters play a significant role in the crystal quality and physical
properties of layered materials. Here we present a case study on a van der
Waals magnetic NbFeTe2 material. Two different types of polymorphic NbFeTe2
phases, synthesized at different temperatures, display significantly different
behaviors in crystal symmetry, electronic structure, electrical transport, and
magnetism. While the phase synthesized at low temperature showing behavior
consistent with previous reports, the new phase synthesized at high
temperature, has completely different physical properties, such as metallic
resistivity, long-range ferromagnetic order, anomalous Hall effect, negative
magnetoresistance, and distinct electronic structures. Neutron diffraction
reveals out-of-plane ferromagnetism below 70K, consistent with the electrical
transport and magnetic susceptibility studies. Our work suggests that simply
tuning synthetic parameters in a controlled manner could be an effective route
to alter the physical properties of existing materials potentially unlocking
new states of matter, or even discovering new materials.

<p>Solid-state cooling devices offer compact, quiet, reliable and
environmentally friendly solutions that currently rely primarily on the
thermoelectric (TE) effect. Despite more than two centuries of research,
classical thermoelectric coolers suffer from low efficiency which hampers wider
application. In this study, the less researched Anomalous Ettingshausen effect
(AEE), a transverse thermoelectric phenomenon, is presented as a new approach
for on-chip cooling. This effect can be boosted in materials with non-trivial
band topologies as demonstrated in the Heusler alloy $\text{Co}_2\text{MnGa}$.
Enabled by the high quality of our material, in situ scanning thermal
microscopy experiments reveal a record-breaking anomalous Ettingshausen
coefficient of $-2.1$~mV in $\mu$m-sized on-chip cooling devices at room
temperature. A significant 44\% of the effect is contributed by the intrinsic
topological properties, in particular the Berry curvature of
$\text{Co}_2\text{MnGa}$, emphasising the unique potential of magnetic Weyl
semimetals for high-performance spot cooling in nanostructures.

finite-size effects, our study pinpoints a clear peak in the spin channel at
low momentum, and we discuss the possibility that such a peak can be
interpreted as the Higgs mode in the superfluid. Our study is complemented by a
systematic comparison with the predictions of generalized random phase
approximation, with the dual purpose to directly compare with auxiliary-field

<br>
</p><i>Irakli Titvinidze, Julian Stobbe, Alexey N. Rubtsov, Georg Rohringer</i>
<p>We present a method to study the time evolution of the single impurity
Anderson model which exploits a mean field decoupling of the interacting
impurity and the non-interacting bath (in form of a chain). This is achieved by
the introduction of a pair of auxiliary Majorana fermions between the impurity
and the chain. After decoupling, we obtain a self-consistent set of equations
for the impurity and chain. First, we study the behavior of the system in
equilibrium at zero temperature. We obtain a phase transition as a function of
the interaction at the impurity and the coupling between the impurity and the
chain between the Kondo regime, where the mean field parameters are zero and,
hence, we have a well-defined spin at the impurity, to a phase where mean field
parameters acquire finite values leading to a screening of the impurity spin by
conduction bath electrons. In the latter case, we observe charge and spin
fluctuations at the impurity site. Starting from this equilibrium ground state
at zero temperature we quench in the interaction strength at the impurity
and/or the hybridization strength between the impurity and the chain and study
the time evolution of the system. We find that for quenches to weak to
intermediate coupling the system converges to the equilibrium state defined by
the final set of parameters after the quench. We analyze the oscillation
frequency and as well as the thermalization rate during this quench. A quench
to a strong interaction value results in persistent oscillations and a trapping
of the system in a non-thermal state. We speculate that these two regimes of
different long-time behavior are separated by a dynamical phase transition.

</p><i>Régis Mélin, Asmaul Smitha Rashid, Morteza Kayyalha</i>
<p>Coupling a two-terminal Josephson junction to the stationary modes of the
electromagnetic field produces the so-called Fiske resonances. Here, we propose
another mechanism based on the exchange between the static Andreev bound states
(ABS) and a nonequilibrium Fermi surface in an ultraclean multiterminal device.
As a simple model, we consider an effective $S_a$-$N_{eff}$-$S_b$ double
junction connecting the superconductors $S_a$ and $S_b$ to the infinite central
normal metal $N_{eff}$. We find that the underlying microscopic process of
phase-sensitive Andreev reflection (phase-AR) produces the possibility of an
inversion, that is, the conductance can be larger at half-flux quantum than in
zero field. The inversion-noninversion alternate as the bias voltage is
increased. In addition, if the central region $N_{eff}$ is an integrable
billiard connected to an infinite normal reservoir, we find that the standard
ABS are replaced by one- and two-particle Andreev resonances that can be probed
by the bias voltage. Finally, we find that, in the corresponding
all-superconducting Andreev interferometer, the superconducting gap produces
protection against the short relaxation time of the quasiparticle continua if
the time periodic dynamics is treated as a perturbation. The spectrum of the
two-particle resonances is then sparse inside the spectrum of the pairs of
one-particle resonances. Our work supports the nonFloquet intrinsic resonances
in two-dimensional metal-based Andreev interferometers, and challenges the
Floquet theory of multiterminal Josephson junctions.

infinite lattice, on the open chain it was studied mainly numerically, while no
analytic results existed even for its phase diagram. In this paper we introduce
new boundary conditions associated with the infinite translation invariant
stationary states of the model, which allow us to obtain the exact phase
diagram analytically. We discuss the phase diagram in detail and confirm the
analytic predictions by extensive numerical simulations.

<p>Materials characterization using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
requires indexing the orientation of the measured region from Kikuchi patterns.
In the presence of defects the quality of the Kikuchi patterns can degrade. Or
if the measured region contains a grain boundary, two or more orientations can
cause pattern overlap which may lead to erroneous orientation calculations. In
this work we show that constrained non-negative matrix factorization can be
successfully employed to characterize such measurements containing signals from
multiple crystallographic orientations, particularly if the misorientation is
very small < 1 deg. Using simulated patterns, we demonstrate the resolution
limit of the method and subsequently showcase a computationally efficient
segmentation of a dendritic microstructure, which is on par with high
resolution EBSD. By analysis of the weight metrics of the components across a
grain boundary or dendrites, we demonstrate how very small
misorientations/low-angle grain boundaries can be resolved at a pixel level.
Our approach constitutes a versatile and robust tool complementing other fast
indexing methods for microstructure characterization.

<p>This work presents a physics-informed neural network approach bridging
deep-learning force field and electronic structure simulations, illustrated
through twisted two-dimensional large-scale material systems. The deep
potential molecular dynamics model is adopted as the backbone, and electronic
structure simulation is integrated. Using Wannier functions as the basis, we
categorize Wannier Hamiltonian elements based on physical principles to
incorporate diverse information from a deep-learning force field model. This
information-sharing mechanism streamlines the architecture of our
multifunctional model, enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Utilizing
Wannier functions as the basis lays the groundwork for predicting more physical
quantities. This approach serves as a powerful tool to explore both the
structural and electronic properties of large-scale systems characterized by
low periodicities. By endowing an existing well-developed machine-learning
force field with electronic structure simulation capabilities, the study marks
a significant advancement in developing multimodal machine-learning-based
computational methods that can achieve multiple functionalities traditionally
exclusive to first-principles calculations.

<h3>Unraveling the Optical Signatures of Polymeric Carbon Nitrides: Insights  into Stacking-Induced Excitonic Transitions</h3>

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable attention due to
their unique physicochemical properties and significant potential in
energy-related applications. Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) with 2D stacked
architecture show promise as photocatalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion and as
versatile 2D semiconductors. However, the lack of a clear definition of the
exact structural model of these materials limits our fundamental understanding
of their unique properties. Here, we investigate the structure-induced optical
properties of PCNs through \textit{ab initio} calculations. Our study on the
electronic and optical properties of PCNs highlights the significant influence
of structure on their behavior, especially near band edges. The analysis
reveals that the degree of condensation and corrugation influences the
electron/hole localization and the energy levels of $\pi$ electrons, which are
crucial for the optical behavior. In addition, the microstructures of 2D
configurations lead to divergent optical properties in 3D configurations, with
characteristic peaks identified at 350 nm and interlayer interactions at
400--500 nm, depending on the specific microstructures. Through observations
over 2D and 3D structures, we elucidate exciton photophysical processes in PCN
materials. This highlights the substantial differences in optical properties
between actual 2D and 3D structures, while also demonstrating the potential for
carrier and energy transport mechanisms to occur perpendicular to the plane.
Finally, our results provide deep insights into the understanding of previously
hidden microstructural, electronic, and optical properties of PCNs, paving the
way for further performance and property enhancements in this class of
materials.

<p>Nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are
fabricated in-situ from a single Bi$_{0.26}$Sb$_{1.74}$Te$_{3}$ nanoribbon that
is defined using selective-area growth and contacted with superconducting Nb

The pronounced oscillations are explained by interference effects of coherent

<p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre quantum sensors provide unique opportunities in
studying condensed matter systems: they are quantitative, noninvasive,
physically robust, offer nanoscale resolution, and may be used across a wide
range of temperatures. These properties have been exploited in recent years to
obtain nanoscale resolution measurements of static magnetic fields arising from
spin order and current flow in condensed matter systems. Compared with other
nanoscale magnetic-field sensors, NV centres have the unique advantage that
they can probe quantities that go beyond average magnetic fields. Leveraging
techniques from magnetic resonance, NV centres can perform high precision noise
sensing, and have given access to diverse systems, such as fluctuating
electrical currents in simple metals and graphene, as well as magnetic dynamics
in yttrium iron garnet. In this review we summarise unique opportunities in
condensed matter sensing by focusing on the connections between specific NV
measurements and previously established physical characteristics that are more
readily understood in the condensed matter community, such as correlation
functions and order parameters that are inaccessible by other techniques, and
we describe the technical frontier enabled by NV centre sensing.

<h3>Towards a redundancy-based theory of structure</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Glenn D. Hibbard, John Çamkıran</i>
<p>We advocate for a theory of materials structure based on the general notion
of redundancy rather than its special case of symmetry. The recoverability of
particle positions from interparticle distances is given as an argument for why
distances rather than positions constitute the fundamental quantity underlying
structure. The rapidly decreasing nature of interaction strength with
interparticle distance is used to argue for the representability of a system
through the neighbourhoods of its constituent particles. The extracopularity
coefficient $E$ is presented as a local quantifier of redundancy and compared
to point group order $|G|$, a local quantifier of symmetry. A fundamental
limitation of $|G|$ is demonstrated. Some perspective is given on how $E$ can
be used to arrive at a global redundancy-based description of a system.

<h3>Magneto-Ionic Vortices: Voltage-Reconfigurable Swirling-Spin  Analog-Memory Nanomagnets</h3>

<p>Rapid progress in information technologies has spurred the need for
innovative memory concepts, for which advanced data-processing methods and
tailor-made materials are required. Here we introduce a previously unexplored
nanoscale magnetic object: an analog magnetic vortex controlled by
electric-field-induced ion motion, termed magneto-ionic vortex or "vortion".
This state arises from paramagnetic FeCoN through voltage gating and gradual
N3-ion extraction within patterned nanodots. Unlike traditional vortex states,
vortions offer comprehensive analog adjustment of key properties such as
magnetization amplitude, nucleation/annihilation fields, or coercivity using
voltage as an energy-efficient tuning knob. This manipulation occurs
post-synthesis, obviating the need for energy-demanding methods like laser
pulses or spin-torque currents. By leveraging an overlooked aspect of
N3-magneto-ionics -- planar ion migration within nanodots -- precise control of
the magnetic layer's thickness is achieved, which enables reversible
transitions among paramagnetic, single-domain, and vortion states, offering
future prospects for analog computing, multi-state data storage, or
brain-inspired devices.

<h3>Elastic properties and thermodynamic anomalies of supersolids</h3>

<p>We study a supersolid in the context of a Gross-Pitaevskii theory with a
non-local effective potential. We employ a homogenisation technique which
allows us to calculate the elastic moduli, supersolid fraction and other state
variables of the system. Our methodology is verified against numerical
simulations of elastic deformations. We can also verify that the
long-wavelength Goldstone modes that emerge from this technique agree with
Bogoliubov theory. We find a thermodynamic anomaly that the supersolid does not
obey the thermodynamic relation $\partial P / \partial V \bigr|_N = - n \,
\partial P / \partial N \bigr|_V$, which we claim is a feature unique to
supersolids.

<h3>Active Nematic Ratchet in Asymmetric Obstacle Arrays</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Cody D. Schimming, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt</i>
<p>We numerically investigate the effect of a periodic array of asymmetric
obstacles in a two-dimensional active nematic. We find that activity in
conjunction with the asymmetry leads to a ratchet effect or unidirectional flow
of the fluid along the asymmetry direction. The directional flow is still
present even in the active turbulent phase when the gap between obstacles is
sufficiently small. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the topological defects
transition from flow-mirroring to smectic-like as the gap between obstacles is
made smaller, and explain this transition in terms of the pinning of negative
winding number defects between obstacles. This also leads to a non-monotonic
ratchet effect magnitude as a function of obstacle size, so that there is an
optimal obstacle size for ratcheting at fixed activity.

<h3>Hydrodynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject  to linear friction</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13755</a>
<br>
</p><i>Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Elsen Tjhung, Thomas Richter, Andreas M. Menzel</i>
<p>To make progress towards the development of a theory on the motion of
inclusions in thin structured films and membranes, we here consider as an
initial step a circular disk in a two-dimensional, uniaxially anisotropic fluid
layer. We assume overdamped dynamics, incompressibility of the fluid, and
global alignment of the axis of anisotropy. Motion within this layer is
affected by additional linear friction with the environment, for instance, a
supporting substrate. We investigate the induced flows in the fluid when the
disk is translated parallel or perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy.
Moreover, expressions for corresponding mobilities and resistance coefficients
of the disk are derived. Our results are obtained within the framework of a
perturbative expansion in the parameters that quantify the anisotropy of the
fluid. Good agreement is found for moderate anisotropy when compared to
associated results from finite-element simulations. At pronounced anisotropy,
the induced flow fields are still predicted qualitatively correctly by the
perturbative theory, although quantitative deviations arise. We hope to
stimulate with our investigations corresponding experimental analyses, for
example, concerning fluid flows in anisotropic thin films on uniaxially rubbed
supporting substrates.

<p>We perform a direct Monte Carlo simulation of the diffusion in a
multicomponent granular medium. We investigate the diffusion coefficients and
mean-squared displacements of granular particles in a polydisperse granular gas
in a homogeneous cooling state containing an arbitrary number of species of
different sizes and masses using both models of constant and time-dependent
restitution coefficients. In our study, we used a powerful low-rank algorithm
that allows for efficient simulation of highly polydisperse granular systems.
Mean square displacements in Monte Carlo simulations are in good agreement with
theoretical predictions.

<p>Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer
potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and
also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in
novel ways. Here we present a theoretical discussion on localized corner and
edge states, as well as electronic properties emerging from topological phases
in Sierpinski Carpet within a $\pi$-flux regime. A topological hopping
parameter phase diagram is constructed from which different spatial localized
states are identified following signatures of distinct fractal generations. The
specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal systems can guide the
supported topological states types and their associated functionalities. A
conductive device is proposed by coupling identical Sierpinski Carpet units
providing transport response through projected edge states that carrier the
details of the Sierpinski Carpet topology.

<h3>Surfactant-Driven Dynamic Changes in Rheology of Activated Carbon Slurry  Electrodes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13782" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13782</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mohan Das, KangJin Lee, Christopher L. Wirth</i>
<p>Slurry electrodes are an effective means to improve flow battery performance
by reducing electrode fouling and increasing the active surface area necessary
for electrochemical reactions. It is critical to understand how the slurry
formulation impacts its rheological profile and ultimately battery performance.
We study the linear and nonlinear rheology of activated carbon (AC) based
slurry electrode used in an all-iron flow battery in the presence of a nonionic
surfactant (Triton X-100). Our results show the slurry mimics a colloidal gel
with elasticity remaining constant despite increasing surfactant concentration
until $\alpha$(=C$_{surf.}$/C$_{AC}$) < 0.65. However, at $\alpha \ge$ 0.65,
the slurry abruptly transitions to a fluid with no measurable yield stress.
This critical surfactant concentration at which the rheological profile
undergoes a dynamic change matches the concentration found previously for gel
collapse of this system. Moreover, this transition is accompanied by a complete
loss of electrical conductivity. These data show that site specific adsorption
of surfactant molecules often used in slurry formulation have a significant and
dramatic impact on flow behavior, which should be considered when formulating a
slurry electrode.
