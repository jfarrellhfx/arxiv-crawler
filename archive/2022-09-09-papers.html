<h3>The Universal Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory</h3>

We study the hydrodynamics of superconductors within the framework of
Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory. We show that in the vicinity of the
superconducting phase transition the most general leading-order EFT satisfying
the local KMS condition is described by a mild generalization of the
Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations of Gor'kov-Eliashberg (with
stochastic terms added). This version of TDGL is applicable whenever the
superconductor is in a local thermodynamic equilibrium and the temperature is
near critical, independently of any microscopic details. Implications of the
generalized TDGL for the existence of propagating collective modes in a
superconductor are discussed. Within this approach, it is possible to include
systematically the effects of non-uniform temperature and heat conductivity, as
well as explicit or spontaneous breaking of time reversal. We also introduce a
thermal version of the Josephson relation and use it to construct an exotic
hydrodynamics describing a phase of matter where heat can flow without
dissipation.

<h3>Thin He-4 films on alkali substrates: where do He-3 atoms bind?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03412" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03412</a>
<br>
<i>Massimo Boninsegni</i>
<br>
The possible occurrence of bound states of He-3 atoms in the vicinity of a
weakly attractive substrate coated with a thin superfluid He-4film is
investigated by first principle computer simulations. No evidence is seen of
such bound states, even in the case of the weakest substrate, i.e., Cs; a
single He-3 atom always binds to the free He-4 surface, regardless of the
thickness of the He-4 film. A comparison of He-4 density profiles computed in
this work with those yielded by the Density Functional approach that led to the
prediction of He-3 bound states near the substrate, shows that the latter may
not have afforded a sufficiently accurate structural description of the
adsorbed He-4 film.

<h3>Compound Defects in Halide Perovskites: A First-Principles Study of  CsPbI$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03484" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03484</a>
<br>
<i>Haibo Xue, José Manuel Vicent-Luna, Shuxia Tao, Geert Brocks</i>
<br>
Lattice defects affect the long-term stability of halide perovskite solar
cells. Whereas simple point defects, i.e., atomic interstitials and vacancies,
have been studied in great detail, here we focus on compound defects that are
more likely to form under crystal growth conditions, such as compound vacancies
or interstitials, and antisites. We identify the most prominent defects in the
archetype inorganic perovskite CsPbI$_3$, through first-principles density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. We find that under equilibrium conditions
at room temperature, the antisite of Pb substituting Cs forms in a
concentration comparable to those of the most prominent point defects, whereas
the other compound defects are negligible. However, under nonequilibrium
thermal and operating conditions, other complexes also become as important as
the point defects. Those are the Cs substituting Pb antisite, and, to a lesser
extent, the compound vacancies of PbI$_2$ or CsPbI$_3$ units, and the I
substituting Cs antisite. These compound defects only lead to shallow or
inactive charge carrier traps, which testifies to the electronic stability of
the halide perovskites. Under operating conditions with a quasi Fermi level
very close to the valence band, deeper traps can develop.

<h3>Structure, magnetism, and spin dynamics of van der Waals ferromagnet VI3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03725</a>
<br>
<i>David Hovancik, Dalibor Repcek, Fedir Borodavka, Christelle Kadlec, Petr Dolezal, Marie Kratochvilova, Jiri Pospisil, Petr Kuzel, Stanislav Kamba, Vladimir Sechovsky</i>
<br>
The complex evolution of crystal structure and magnetism in the recently
discovered van der Waals ferromagnet VI3 is strikingly different from the
widely known relatively simple uniaxial ferromagnet CrI3. Here we use the
synergy of infrared, terahertz, and Raman spectroscopies with DFT calculations
to shed light on the magnetic and lattice properties of VI3 single crystals at
low temperatures. The structural phase transition at Ts1 = 79 K is accompanied
by a large splitting of polar phonon modes. Below this transition, strong
ferromagnetic fluctuations are observed still in the paramagnetic phase well
above the Curie temperature (TC = 50 K). The variations of phonon frequencies
observed at 55 K reflect the proximity of long-range ferromagnetic order. They
are induced by a magnetoelastic coupling enhanced by strong spin-orbit
interaction. A high-frequency acoustic magnon in the THz range is observed in
Raman spectra below the critical temperature Ts2 of the second structural
transition associated with the order-order magnetic phase transition. Below TC
other two Raman active modes simultaneously appear and show a dramatic
softening upon cooling in the narrow temperature interval around Ts2. The THz
frequency of magnon observed in VI3 indicates the application potential of 2D
van der Waals ferromagnets in ultrafast THz spintronics, which has previously
been considered as an exclusive domain of antiferromagnets.

<h3>Rydberg dressed spin-1/2 Fermi gases in one dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03368</a>
<br>
<i>Junhyun Lee, Pavel A. Volkov, B. J. DeSalvo, J. H. Pixley</i>
<br>
The emergent phases of strongly correlated spin-1/2 Fermi gases of Rydberg
dressed atoms in a one dimensional optical lattice are theoretically
investigated. At weak coupling a bosonization description is used to
demonstrate the ability to drive alternating quantum phase transitions between
distinct Luttinger liquids. At strong coupling the ground state develops
non-trivial phase separation exhibiting Luttinger liquid ''puddles'' separated
by magnetic domain walls due to the interplay of the incommensurate filling and
the Rydberg core length scale. These phases can be detected in ultracold gases
of Rydberg atoms made from $^6$Li.

<h3>From Symmetries to Commutant Algebras in Standard Hamiltonians</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03370</a>
<br>
<i>Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich</i>
<br>
In this work, we revisit several families of standard Hamiltonians that
appear in the literature and discuss their symmetries and conserved quantities
in the language of commutant algebras. In particular, we start with families of
Hamiltonians defined by parts that are local, and study the algebra of
operators that separately commute with each part. The families of models we
discuss include the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model and its deformations, several
types of spinless and spinful free-fermion models, and the Hubbard model. This
language enables a decomposition of the Hilbert space into dynamically
disconnected sectors that reduce to the conventional quantum number sectors for
regular symmetries. In addition, we find examples of non-standard conserved
quantities even in some simple cases, which demonstrates the need to enlarge
the usual definitions of symmetries and conserved quantities. In the case of
free-fermion models, this decomposition is related to the decompositions of
Hilbert space via irreducible representations of certain Lie groups proposed in
earlier works, while the algebra perspective applies more broadly, in
particular also to arbitrary interacting models. Further, the von Neumann
Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) enables a systematic construction of local
operators with a given symmetry or commutant algebra, potentially eliminating
the need for "brute-force" numerical searches carried out in the literature,
and we show examples of such applications of the DCT. This paper paves the way
for both systematic construction of families of models with exact scars and
characterization of such families in terms of non-standard symmetries, pursued
in a parallel paper.

<h3>Exhaustive Characterization of Quantum Many-Body Scars using Commutant  Algebras</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377</a>
<br>
<i>Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich</i>
<br>
We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant
algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local
Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected
subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace
and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of
unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this
unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking
phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use
the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the
exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS. We
illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2
ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic
$\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write
down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.
Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to
recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such
Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence
of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also
illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS
Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori
construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework
motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they
violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we
discuss its implications to dynamics.

<h3>Interaction-controlled impurity transport in trapped mixtures of  ultracold bosons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03396" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03396</a>
<br>
<i>Judith Becker, Maxim Pyzh, Peter Schmelcher</i>
<br>
We explore the dynamical transport of an impurity between different embedding
majority species which are spatially separated in a double well. The transfer
and storage of the impurity is triggered by dynamically changing the
interaction strengths between the impurity and the two majority species. We
find a simple but efficient protocol consisting of linear ramps of
majority-impurity interactions at designated times to pin or unpin the
impurity. Our study of this highly imbalanced few-body triple mixture is
conducted with the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree
method for atomic mixtures which accounts for all interaction-induced
correlations. We analyze the dynamics in terms of single-particle densities,
entanglement growth and provide an effective potential description involving
mean-fields of the interacting components. The majority components remain
self-trapped in their individual wells at all times, which is a crucial element
for the effectiveness of our protocol. During storage times each component
performs low-amplitude dipole oscillations in a single well. Unexpectedly, the
inter-species correlations possess a stabilizing impact on the transport and
storage properties of the impurity particle.

<h3>Cryogenic probe for low-noise, high-frequency electronic measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03400</a>
<br>
<i>Erick Garcia, Calvin Bales, William Patterson, Alexander Zaslavsky, Vesna F. Mitrović</i>
<br>
The design and performance of a low-noise, modular cryogenic probe,
applicable to a wide range of measurements over a broad range of working
frequencies, temperatures, and magnetic fields is presented. The design of the
probe facilitates the exchange of sample holders and sample-stage amplifiers,
which, combined with its characteristic low transmission and reflection loss,
make this design suitable for high precision or low sensitivity measurements.
The specific example of measuring the shot noise of magnetic tunnel junctions
is discussed. We highlight various design characteristics chosen specifically
to expand the applicability of the probe to measurement techniques such as
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

<h3>Exponential Tails and Asymmetry Relations for the Spread of Biased  Random Walks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03410</a>
<br>
<i>Stanislav Burov, Wanli Wang, Eli Barkai</i>
<br>
Exponential, and not Gaussian, decay of probability density functions was
studied by Laplace in the context of his analysis of errors. Such Laplace
propagators for the diffusive motion of single particles in disordered media
were recently observed in numerous experimental systems. What will happen to
this universality when an external driving force is applied? Using the
ubiquitous continuous time random walk with bias, and the Crooks relation in
conjunction with large deviations theory, we derive two properties of the
positional probability density function $P_F(x,t)$ that hold for a wide
spectrum of random walk models: (I) Universal asymmetric exponential decay of
$P_F(X,t)$ for large $|X|$, and (II) Existence of a time transformation that
for large $|X|$ allows to express $P_F(X,t)$ in terms of the propagator of the
unbiased process (measured at a shorter time). These findings allow us to
establish how the symmetric exponential-like tails, measured in many unbiased
processes, will transform into asymmetric Laplace tails when an external force
is applied.

<h3>Planted matching problems on random hypergraphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03423</a>
<br>
<i>Urte Adomaityte, Anshul Toshniwal, Gabriele Sicuro, Lenka Zdeborová</i>
<br>
We consider the problem of inferring a matching hidden in a weighted random
$k$-hypergraph. We assume that the hyperedges' weights are random and
distributed according to two different densities conditioning on the fact that
they belong to the hidden matching, or not. We show that, for $k>2$ and in the
large graph size limit, an algorithmic first order transition in the signal
strength separates a regime in which a complete recovery of the hidden matching
is feasible from a regime in which partial recovery is possible. This is in
contrast to the $k=2$ case where the transition is known to be continuous.
Finally, we consider the case of graphs presenting a mixture of edges and
$3$-hyperedges, interpolating between the $k=2$ and the $k=3$ cases, and we
study how the transition changes from continuous to first order by tuning the
relative amount of edges and hyperedges.

<h3>Variational optimization of tensor-network states with the  honeycomb-lattice corner transfer matrix</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03428</a>
<br>
<i>I.V. Lukin, A.G. Sotnikov</i>
<br>
We develop a method of variational optimization of the infinite projected
entangled pair states on the honeycomb lattice. The method is based on the
automatic differentiation of the honeycomb lattice corner transfer matrix
renormalization group. We apply the approach to the antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice. The developed formalism
gives quantitatively accurate results for the main physical observables and has
a necessary potential for further extensions.

<h3>The Stability of the Quantum Hall State at $ν= 1$ in Bilayer Electron  Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03429</a>
<br>
<i>A.A. Vasilchenko</i>
<br>
The ground states of electrons in two vertically coupled quantum dots in the
presence of an external magnetic field have been studied within the density
functional theory. A phase diagram of the transition to the quantum Hall state
in double quantum dots has been plotted for the Landau level filling factor
$\nu = 1$. It has been shown that the quantum Hall state can be stable for a
zero tunnel splitting. The influence of the impurity potential on the stability
condition for the quantum Hall state has been analyzed.

<h3>ScGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network to Predict Hypothetical  Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03444" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03444</a>
<br>
<i>Evan Kim, S.V. Dordevic</i>
<br>
Despite having been discovered more than three decades ago, High Temperature
Superconductors (HTSs) lack both an explanation for their mechanisms and a
systematic way to search for them. To aid this search, this project proposes
ScGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to efficiently predict new
superconductors. ScGAN was trained on compounds in OQMD and then transfer
learned onto the SuperCon database or a subset of it. Once trained, the GAN was
used to predict superconducting candidates, and approximately 70\% of them were
determined to be superconducting by a classification model--a 23-fold increase
in discovery rate compared to manual search methods. Furthermore, more than
99\% of predictions were novel materials, demonstrating that ScGAN was able to
potentially predict completely new superconductors, including several promising
HTS candidates. This project presents a novel, efficient way to search for new
superconductors, which may be used in technological applications or provide
insight into the unsolved problem of high temperature superconductivity.

Domain walls are ubiquitous in materials that undergo phase transitions
driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Domain walls in ferroics and
multiferroics have received tremendous attention recently due to their emergent
properties distinct from their domain counterparts, for example, their high
mobility and controllability, as well as their potential applications in
nanoelectronics. However, it is extremely challenging to detect, visualize and
study the ferro-rotational (FR) domain walls because the FR order, in contrast
to ferromagnetism (FM) and ferroelectricity (FE), is invariant under both the
spatial-inversion and the time-reversal operations and thus hardly couple with
conventional experimental probes. Here, an FR candidate $\mathrm{NiTiO_{3}}$ is
investigated by ultrasensitive electric quadrupole (EQ) second harmonic
generation rotational anisotropy (SHG RA) to probe the point symmetries of the
two degenerate FR domain states, showing their relation by the vertical mirror
operations that are broken below the FR critical temperature. We then visualize
the real-space FR domains by scanning EQ SHG microscopy, and further resolve
the FR domain walls by revealing a suppressed SHG intensity at domain walls. By
taking local EQ SHG RA measurements, we show the restoration of the mirror
symmetry at FR domain walls and prove their unconventional nonpolar nature. Our
findings not only provide a comprehensive insight into FR domain walls, but
also demonstrate a unique and powerful tool for future studies on domain walls
of unconventional ferroics, both of which pave the way towards future
manipulations and applications of FR domain walls.

<br>
The paper describes a study of wet foams in microgravity whose bubble size
distribution evolves due to diffusive gas exchange. We focus on the comparison
between the size of bubbles determined from images of the foam surface and the
size of bubbles in the bulk foam, determined from Diffuse Transmission
Spectroscopy (DTS). Extracting the bubble size distribution from images of a
foam surface is difficult so we have used three different procedures : manual
analysis, automatic analysis with a customized Python script and machine
learning analysis. Once various pitfalls were identified and taken into
account, all the three procedures yield identical results within error bars.
DTS only allows the determination of an average bubble radius which is
proportional to the photon transport mean free path $\ell^*$. The relation
between the measured diffuse transmitted light intensity and {$\ell^*$}
previously derived for slab-shaped samples of infinite lateral extent does not
apply to the cuboid geometry of the cells used in the microgravity experiment.
A new more general expression of the diffuse intensity transmitted with
specific optical boundary conditions has been derived and applied to determine
the average bubble radius. The temporal evolution of the average bubble radii
deduced from DTS and of the same average radii of the bubbles measured at the
sample surface are in very good agreement throughout the coarsening. Finally,
ground experiments were performed to compare bubble size distributions in a
bulk wet foam and at its surface at times so short that diffusive gas exchange
is insignificant. They were found to be similar, confirming that bubbles seen
at the surface are representative of the bulk foam bubbles.

Artists regularly make soap bubbles several meters long. In this article we
make soap films up to two meters high by pulling a horizontal fishing line
driven by belts out of a soapy solution at velocities ranging from 20 cm/s to
250 cm/s. We characterize the thickness profile of the central part of the film
that behaves like a rubber band under tension. We show that its thickness
profile is well described by a static model in which a homogeneous elastic film
is stretched by its own weight. This leads to an exponential thickness profile
with a characteristic length given by a competition between gravity and surface
elasticity. The prefactor is fixed by the shape and area of the film, governed
by the fishing line motion but also by a continuous extraction of foam film
from the lateral menisci, thicker than the central part, and that progressively
invades the film from its lateral boundaries. The model we propose captures the
subtle interplay between gravity, film elasticity and film extraction and leads
to predictions in good agreement with our experimental data.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Magnons from Hot Electrons in Antiferromagnetic Systems</h3>

<i>Marion M. S. Barbeau, Mikhail Titov, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</i>
<br>
We describe a \emph{nonthermal} magnon activation mechanism in
antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems via locally equilibrated
\emph{spin-unpolarized} hot electrons excited by an ultrafast intense laser
pulse. We employ a quantum kinetic equation that takes into account a direct
electron-magnon scattering channel in either bulk AFM metal or at the interface
of the AFM/normal-metal heterostructure. The mechanism is responsible for the
nonequilibrium population of AFM magnon modes on a subnanosecond timescale,
which are formed shortly after the local thermalization of hot electrons by
Coulomb interactions. Nonequilibrium magnon populations can be additionally
manipulated by applying an external magnetic field. Our work paves the way
toward spin dynamics control in AFM systems via the ultrafast manipulation of
out-of-equilibrium magnon excitations.

Underscreening is a collective term for charge correlations in electrolytes
decaying slower than the Debye length. Anomalous underscreening refers to
phenomenology that cannot be attributed alone to steric interactions.
Experiments with concentrated electrolytes and ionic fluids report anomalous
underscreening which so far has not been observed in simulation. We present
Molecular Dynamics simulation results exhibiting anomalous underscreening that
can be connected to cluster formation. A theory which accounts for ion pairing
confirms the trend. Our results challenge the classic understanding of dense
electrolytes impacting the design of technologies for energy storage and
conversion.

<h3>Superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal transition lines</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03515</a>

<br>
Nonreciprocity in superconductors is attracting much interest owing to its
fundamental importance as well as its potential applicability to engineering.
In this paper, we generalize the previous theories of the intrinsic
superconducting diode effect (SDE) and microscopically elucidate its
relationship with the nonreciprocity of the transition lines under
supercurrent. We derive a general formula for the intrinsic SDE by using the
phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and thereby show that the SDE is
determined by the relative angle between the magnetic field and an effective
anti-symmetric spin-orbit coupling defined from the Ginzburg-Landau
coefficients. The obtained formula offers a convenient criterion to obtain a
finite SDE. We also study the SDE and the nonreciprocal phase transitions of
the $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconductors by using the mean-field theory. It is
established that the sign reversal of the SDE accompanied by the crossover of
the helical superconductivity is a general feature irrespective of the system
details. We study the phase transition lines in the temperature-magnetic-field
phase diagram under the supercurrent, and clarify that the sign reversal of the
SDE generally accompanies the crossings of the transition lines under positive
and negative current directions. Furthermore, the superconducting phases under
the supercurrent even become re-entrant under moderate strength of the electric
current, implying the current-induced first-order phase transitions. Our
findings establish the electric current as the control parameter and the
powerful probe to study the superconducting properties related to the
finite-momentum Cooper pairs.

<h3>Kramers Fulde-Ferrell state and superconducting spin diode effect</h3>

<i>Yi Zhang, Ziqiang Wang</i>
<br>
We study a novel Fulde-Ferrell equal-spin pairing state with the opposite
center of mass Cooper pair momentum for each spin polarization. This state
respects time-reversal symmetry and can be realized in a one-dimensional system
with spin-orbit coupling and nearest neighbor attraction. We find this state
can have nonreciprocal spin transport for both the bulk superconductor and the
Josephson junction structure when a hidden inversion symmetry is broken. In
addition to the spin Josephson diode effect, we find that the charge transport
in such Josephson junctions is controlled by intriguing dynamics of bound
states whose transitions can be manipulated by the length of the
superconducting chain.

<h3>Intrinsic planar Hall effect in tilted Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03527</a>
<br>

<br>
The consequence of chiral anomaly on magneto-conductance of Weyl semimetals
(WSM) has been studied extensively. Current theories predict that the
magneto-conductance is an extrinsic effect which depends on the relaxation time
and is originated by chiral anomaly. We study the intrinsic magneto-conductance
of WSM solely due to band topology using semiclassical theory up to the
second-order, focusing on planar Hall effect (PHE) where E, B, and Hall current
lie in the same plane. For tilted WSM, the linear planar Hall conductivity
(PHC) tensor is found to have both symmetric and anti-symmetric components
corresponding to, respectively, the extrinsic PHC and intrinsic PHC, which
serves as a smoking gun to detect intrinsic PHC experimentally. The Lorentz
force in k-space due to field induced Berry curvature is identified as the
physical origin of anti-symmetric nature of intrinsic PHC. In order to observe
intrinsic PHC, the tilt vector has to make an angle {\phi} with normal
direction of E-B plane. In particular, if {\phi} = 0 both linear and nonlinear
intrinsic PHE is independent of the angle {\theta} between E and B, and at the
same time, an intrinsic chiral magnetic effect emerges with current J ~ E {B^3}
{\hat{B}} sin {\theta} when chiral anomaly is absent.

<h3>Shapiro steps in charge-density-wave states driven by ultrasound</h3>

<br>
<i>Michiyasu Mori, Sadamichi Maekawa</i>
<br>
We show that an ultrasound can induce the Shapiro steps (SS) in the
charge-density-wave (CDW) state. When an ultrasound with frequency $\omega$ is
applied with a dc bias-voltage, the SS appear at the current $I$ $\propto$
2$n\omega$ with integer $n$. Although an ac voltage was previously used to
induce the SS in the CDW state, the SS with the ac voltage with frequency
$\omega$ appeared at $I\propto n\omega$ instead of 2$n\omega$. This is the
difference between the ultrasound and the ac voltage. Since the \dvdi shows
sharp peaks due to the SS, the drastic changes in the \iv curve will be applied
to a highly sensitive detector of ultrasound.

<h3>Dominance of Electron-Magnon Scattering in Itinerant Ferromagnet  Fe3GeTe2</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Saha, M. Singh, V. Nagpal, P. Das, S. Patnaik</i>
<br>
Fe3GeTe2 is a 2-dimensional van der Waals material exhibiting itinerant
ferromagnetism upto 230 K. Here, we study aspects of scattering mechanism in
Fe3Ge2Te2 single crystals via resistivity, magneto-transport and Hall effect
measurements. The quadratic temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
below the Curie temperature hints towards the dominance of electron-magnon
scattering. A non-saturating positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at low
temperatures when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the sample plane.
The linear negative MR at high fields for T < TC corroborates to the
suppression in magnon population due to the damping of spin waves. In the high
temperature regime T > TC,MR can be described by the scattering from spin
fluctuations using the model described by Khosla and Fischer. Isothermal Hall
resistivity curves unveil the presence of anomalous Hall resistivity.
Correlation between MR and side jump mechanism further reveals that the
electron-magnon scattering is responsible for the side jump contribution to the
anomalous Hall effect. Our results provide a clear understanding of the role of
electron-magnon scattering on anomalous Hall effect that rules out its origin
to be the topological band structure.

<h3>Study of phase transition of Potts model with DANN</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiangna Chen, Feiyi Liu, Shiyang Chen, Jianmin Shen, Weibing Deng, Gabor Papp, Wei Li, Chunbin Yang</i>
<br>
A transfer learning method, domain adversarial neural network (DANN), is
introduced to study the phase transition of two-dimensional q-state Potts
model. With the DANN, we only need to choose a few labeled configurations
automatically as input data, then the critical points can be obtained after
training the algorithm. By an additional iterative process, the critical points
can be captured to comparable accuracy to Monte Carlo simulations as we
demonstrate it for q = 3, 5, 7 and 10. The type of phase transition (first or
second-order) is also determined at the same time. Meanwhile, for the
second-order phase transition at q = 3, we can calculate the critical exponent
$\nu$ by data collapse. Furthermore, compared with the traditional supervised
learning, the DANN is of higher accuracy with lower cost.

<br>
(Ca$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$ is a rare system that has been shown
to display an interesting interplay between structural quantum criticality and
superconductivity. A putative structural quantum critical point, which is
hidden beneath a broad superconducting dome, is believed to give rise to
optimized superconducting properties in
(Ca$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$. However, the presence of the
superconducting dome itself hinders the examination of the quantum critical
point through electrical transport, as the transport coefficients vanish in the
superconducting state. Here, we use critical current density to explore within
the superconducting dome. Our measurements reveal a large enhancement of the
critical current density at the zero-temperature limit when the system is tuned
towards the structural quantum critical point.

<h3>Effect of Thermal and Mechanical Rejuvenation on Rheological Behavior of  Chocolate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03581" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03581</a>
<br>
<i>Tulika Bhattacharyya, Yogesh M Joshi</i>
<br>
Chocolate is known to undergo solid-liquid transition upon an increase in
temperature as well as under application of deformation field. Upon sudden
reduction in temperature from a molten state (or thermal rejuvenation),
rheological properties of chocolate undergo evolution as a function of time
under isothermal conditions, a behavior reminiscent of physical aging in
polymeric glasses. Then again, subsequent to cessation of shear flow (or
mechanical rejuvenation), chocolate shows temporal evolution of the rheological
properties, a behavior similar to physical aging in soft glassy materials. In
this work, we evaluate three rheological properties, namely, dynamic moduli,
relaxation time spectrum and characteristic relaxation time of chocolate, and
compare their evolution after thermal as well as mechanical rejuvenation. We
observe that the evolution of the rheological properties subsequent to
mechanical rejuvenation is distinctly different from that of thermal
rejuvenation, wherein the evolution is more gradual in the former case. On the
one hand, this work provides unique insights into how shear affects the
rheological behavior of chocolate. On the other hand, this work clearly
suggests that chocolate explores different sections of the energy landscape
after mechanical rejuvenation compared to that of thermal rejuvenation.

<h3>On the Nature of Flow Curve and Categorization of Thixotropic Yield  Stress Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03586" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03586</a>
<br>

<br>
Thixotropy and presence of yield stress are closely related to each other.
Yield stress in a material has also been observed to change as a function of
time. Additionally, both these characteristic features in a material strongly
influence the steady state flow curve of the same. This study aims to
understand the interrelation between thixotropy, yield stress and their
relation with the flow curve. In this regard, we study five thixotropic
materials that show yield stress. The relaxation time of all the five systems
shows power-law dependence on aging time with behaviors ranging from sub aging,
simple aging to hyper aging. Furthermore, the elastic modulus and yield stress
has been observed to be constant for some systems while time dependent for the
others. We also analyze the experimental behavior through a viscoelastic
thixotropic structural kinetic model that predicts the observed experimental
behavior of constant as well as time-dependent yield stress quite well. These
findings indicate that a non-monotonic steady-state flow curve in a structural
kinetic formalism necessarily leads to a time-dependent yield stress, while the
constant yield stress is predicted by a monotonic steady-state flow curve with
stress plateau in the limit of low shear rates. The present work, therefore,
shows that thixotropic materials may exhibit either monotonic or non-monotonic
flow curves. Consequently, thixotropic materials may show no yield stress,
constant yield stress or time-dependent yield stress.

<br>
Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we investigate the
metal-insulator transitions induced by the stripe of charge density in an
interacting two-dimensional Dirac fermion system. The stripe will introduce the
transport anisotropy and insulating intermediate phase into the system,
accompanied by the change of band structure and a peak of density of states
around Fermi energy. In the case of strong correlation, stripe exhibits
competition with Coulomb repulsion through closing the energy gap and
disrupting the magnetic order, and finally drives the system in Mott insulating
phase back to the metallic state. Our results may provide a feasible way to
modify transport properties by setting charge stripes in experiments.

The growth and structural analysis of topological semimetal (TSM) PdTe2 were
carried out in this study. The self-flux method was employed to grow the single
crystals which were structurally characterized by XRD, SEM and EDAX, while the
vibrational modes were observed by Raman spectroscopy. Further, the transport
properties of the grown crystal are also investigated, which show the presence
of the weak anti-localization effect. The low field (1Tesla)
magnetoconductivity is studied by Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) model, and the
physical parameters are extracted. Further, a quadratic term and a linear term
in applied field were added in HLN model, which are accounted for quantum and
classical contributions in conduction mechanism. The modified HLN model was
used to study magneto-conductivity in entire field range and at temperature
from 2-100 K. This study not only confirmed the growth of single crystal PdTe2,
but also verified the presence of topological surface states (TSS) through the
HLN analysis of magneto-transport measurements.

<br>
Here, we correlate the nanoscale morphology and chemical composition of solid
electrolyte interphases (SEI) with the electrochemical property of
graphite-based composite electrodes. Using electrochemical strain microscopy
(ESM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), changes of chemical
composition and morphology (Li and F distribution) in SEI layers on the
electrodes as a function of solid electrolyte contents are analyzed. As a
result, we find a strong correlation between morphological variations on the
electrode, Li and F distribution in SEI layer, and Coulomb efficiency. This
correlation determines the optimum composition of the composite electrode
surface that can maximize the physical and chemical uniformity of the solid
electrolyte on the electrode, which is a key parameter to increase
electrochemical performance in solid-state batteries.

<br>
Temperature-linear resistance at low temperatures in strange metals is an
exotic characteristic of strong correlation systems, as observed in high-TC
superconducting cuprates, heavy fermions, Fe-based superconductors, ruthenates,
and twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we introduce a hole-doped valley-spin
insulator, V-doped WSe2, with hole pockets in the valence band. The strange
metal characteristic was observed in VxW1-xSe2 at a critical carrier
concentration of 9.5 x 10^20 cm-3 from 150 K to 1.8 K. The unsaturated
magnetoresistance is almost linearly proportional to the magnetic field. Using
the ansatz R(H,T) - R(0,0) ~ [(alpha.k.T)^2+(gamma.mu.B)^2]^1/2, the
gamma/alpha ratio is estimated approximately to 4, distinct from that for the
quasiparticles of LSCO, BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (gamma/alpha=1) and bosons of YBCO
(gamma/alpha=2). Our observation opens up the possible routes that induce
strong correlation and superconductivity in two-dimensional materials with
strong spin-orbit coupling.

The electrical 3 dB bandwidth is regularly used as a measure for the response
speed of a photodetector and is estimated via various approaches in literature,
ranging from direct measurements to gauged values via approximations. Great
care must be taken when comparing these 3 dB bandwidths, since approximations
are only strictly valid for ideal circuits. This paper demonstrates that, for
typical photodetectors based on new emerging nanostructured materials, namely
quantum dots and transition metal dichalcogenides, the bandwidth can deviate up
to 10^3 depending on the chosen approach for the bandwidth specification.

<br>
M-type hexaferrite BaFe12O19 was recently reported to be a new type of
quantum paraelectrics with triangular lattice by showing a low temperature
dielectric plateau due to quantum fluctuation. It has also been proposed to
have a possible quantum-dipole liquid ground state. To suppress its quantum
fluctuations and reach a possible quantum critical point, we have tuned its
quantum paraelectricity in three ways: (i) 57Fe isotope replacement; (ii)
in-plane compressive strain; and (iii) hydrostatic pressure. It is found that
95% 57Fe replacement and the in-plane strain are more effective to drive its
ground state closer to a critical region by inducing a peak feature in the
temperature dependence of dielectric constant. In contrast, the application of
hydrostatic pressure pushed the system away from the quantum critical point by
gradually suppressing the plateau feature in dielectric constant. Our combined
efforts reveal the potential of the M-type hexaferrites for studying the
quantum critical behaviors.

We investigate a semiconductor nanowire-based gatemon qubit with epitaxial Al
on two facets of the nanowire, allowing gate control of wire density. Two
segments have the Al removed, one forming a Josephson junction and the other
operating as a transistor, providing in-situ switching between dc transport and
qubit operation. Gating the NW changes the bulk wire potential distribution,
while gating the Josephson junction changes the number of junction modes. Both
effects are revealed by the dependence of qubit frequency on parallel magnetic
field. A detailed model of the wire and junction yields behavior consistent
with experiment. In the multi-mode regime, fluctuations in qubit frequency are
considerably smaller than the theoretical "universal" value, also smaller than
numerics, and consistent with previous measurements of fluctuating critical
current.

<h3>General symmetry breaking at a topological phase transition</h3>

<br>
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a foundational concept in the
characterisation of phase transitions. Certain experimental systems produce,
however, symmetry-breaking phenomena at the topological
Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition, despite spontaneous symmetry
breaking being precluded by the vanishing of the expected norm of the $U(1)$
order parameter in the thermodynamic limit. Examples include recent
observations of experimental symmetry breaking in superconducting films. While
the slow approach to the thermodynamic limit is known to be at the root of this
paradox, the dynamical symmetry-breaking framework required for the
superconducting film remains unresolved. Here we provide this by introducing
the broader concept of \emph{general symmetry breaking}. This encompasses both
spontaneous symmetry breaking and the experimental anomalies by allowing the
expected norm of the order parameter to go to zero in the thermodynamic limit,
provided its directional phase fluctuations are asymptotically smaller,
returning zero following the thermodynamic and then long-time limits. This
explicitly demonstrates that the order parameter arbitrarily chooses a
well-defined direction in the thermodynamic limit, reflecting experimental
$U(1)$ phase fluctuations being negligible compared to the expected norm at
arbitrarily large system size. Our results provide a model for
symmetry-restoring timescales in a wide array of experimental systems.

<h3>Effects of the rf current and bias field direction on the transition  from linear to non-linear gyrotropic dynamics in magnetic vortex structures</h3>

<br>
We present a frequency-domain study of the dynamic behavior of a magnetic
vortex core within a single Permalloy disk by means of electrical detection and
micromagnetic simulations. When exciting the vortex core dynamics in a
non-linear regime, the lineshape of the rectified dc signal reveals a resonance
peak splitting which depends on the excitation amplitude. Using micromagnetic
simulations, we show that at high excitation power the peak splitting
originates from the nanosecond time scale quasi-periodic switching of the
vortex core polarity. Using lock-in detection, the rectified voltage is
integrated over a ms time scale, so that the net signal detected between the
two resonant peaks for a given range of parameters cancels out. The results are
in agreement with the reported effects of the in-plane static field magnitude
on the gyration dynamics, and complement them by detailed analysis of the
effects of the rf current amplitude and the azimuthal angle of the in-plane
bias magnetic field. Systematic characterization shows that a transition from
linear to nonlinear dynamical regime can be controlled by rf current as well as
by varying the magnitude and the direction of the bias magnetic field.

We report here on results of experimental-theoretical investigation of
high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in layers of CdSe semiconductor quantum
dots of different sizes and a reference bulk CdSe thin film. We observe a
strong decrease in the efficiency, up to complete suppression of HHG with
energies of quanta above the bandgap for the smallest dots, whereas the
intensity of below bandgap harmonics remains weakly affected by the dot size.
In addition, it is observed that the ratio between suppression of above gap
harmonics versus below gap harmonics increases with driving wavelength. We
suggest that the reduction in the dot size below the classical electron
oscillatory radius and the corresponding off the dots wall scattering limits
the maximum acceleration by the laser field. Moreover, this scattering leads to
a chaotization of motion, causing dephasing and a loss of coherence, therefore
suppressing the efficiency of the emission of highest-order harmonics. Our
results demonstrate a new regime of intense laser-nanoscale solid interaction,
intermediate between the bulk and single molecule response.

<i>Hironobu Yoshida, Hosho Katsura</i>
<br>
Motivated by recent progress in cold-atom experiments, we analyze the SU($N$)
Fermi-Hubbard model on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with two-body loss.
By focusing on states near the ferromagnetic steady states, we obtain the
Liouvillian gap in closed form for any $d$ and $N$. We also investigate the
dynamics of a ferromagnetic initial state with a single spin flip analytically
in strongly- and weakly-interacting and dissipative limits and numerically for
various values of the parameters. Then we show that, by decreasing the strength
of the interaction and loss, a crossover from the power-law decay to the
exponential decay occurs. We expect that our findings can be tested
experimentally with ultracold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an optical lattice.

The propagation of excitons in TMD monolayers has been intensively studied
revealing interesting many-particle effects, such as halo formation and
non-classical diffusion. Initial studies have investigated how exciton
transport changes in twisted TMD bilayers, including Coulomb repulsion and
Hubbard-like exciton hopping. In this work, we investigate the
twist-angle-dependent transition of the hopping regime to the dispersive regime
of effectively free excitons. Based on a microscopic approach for excitons in
the presence of a moir\'e potential, we show that the hopping regime occurs up
to an angle of approximately 2{\deg} and is well described by the Hubbard
model. At large angles, however, the Hubbard model fails due to increasingly
delocalized exciton states. Here, the quantum mechanical dispersion of free
particles with an effective mass determines the propagation of excitons.
Overall, our work provides microscopic insights into the character of exciton
propagation in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

Van der Waals heterostructures built by vertically stacked transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit a rich energy landscape including interlayer and
intervalley excitons. Recent experiments demonstrated an ultrafast charge
transfer in TMD heterostructures. However, the nature of the charge transfer
process has remained elusive. Based on a microscopic and material-realistic
exciton theory, we reveal that phonon-mediated scattering via strongly
hybridized intervalley excitons governs the charge transfer process that occurs
on a sub-100fs timescale. We track the time-, momentum-, and energy-resolved
relaxation dynamics of optically excited excitons and determine the
temperature- and stacking-dependent charge transfer time for different TMD
bilayers. The provided insights present a major step in microscopic
understanding of the technologically important charge transfer process in van
der Waals heterostructures.

<h3>Replica symmetry breaking in random lasers]{Replica symmetry breaking in  random lasers: \\ experimental measurement of the overlap distribution</h3>

<i>Claudio Conti, Neda Ghofraniha, Luca Leuzzi, Giancarlo Ruocco</i>
<br>
In this chapter we report on the measurements of the overlap distribution of
the replica symmetry breaking solution in complex disordered systems. After a
general introduction to the problem of the experimental validation of the
Parisi order parameter, we focus on the systems where the measurement has been
possible for the first time: random lasers. Starting from first principles of
light-matter interaction we sketch the main steps leading to the construction
of the statistical mechanical model for the dynamics of light modes in a random
laser, a spherical multi-p-spin model with complex spins. A new overlap is
introduced, the intensity fluctuation overlap, whose probability distribution,
under specific assumptions, is equivalent to the Parisi overlap distribution.
The experimental protocol for measuring this overlap is based on the
possibility of experimentally realizing real replicas. After a description of
the first experiment on the random laser made of T5CO$_x$ grains we review and
discuss various experiments measuring the overlap distribution, as well the
possible connection with Levy-like distribution of the intensity of the light
modes around the laser threshold, the connection with turbulence in fiber
lasers and the role of spatial etherogeneities of light modes in random media.

<h3>Transformation twinning to create isospectral cavities</h3>

Bounded domains have discrete eigenfrequencies/spectra, and cavities with
different boundaries and areas have different spectra. A general methodology
for isospectral twinning, whereby the spectra of different cavities are made to
coincide, is created by combining ideas from across physics including
transformation optics, inverse problems and metamaterial cloaking. We twin a
hexagonal drum with a deformed hexagonal drum using a non-singular coordinate
transform that adjusts the deformed shape by mapping a near boundary domain to
a zone of heterogeneous anisotropic medium. Splines define the mapping zone for
twinning these two drums and we verify isospectrality by finite element
analysis.

<h3>Model studies on motion of respiratory droplets driven through a face  mask</h3>

<br>
Face masks are used to intercept respiratory droplets to prevent spreading of
air-borne diseases. Designing face masks with better efficiency needs
microscopic understanding on how respiratory droplets move through a mask. Here
we study a simple model on the interception of droplets by a face mask. The
mask is treated as a polymeric network in an asymmetric confinement, while the
droplet is taken as a micrometer sized tracer colloidal particle, subject to
driving force that mimics the breathing. We study numerically, using the
Langevin dynamics, the tracer particle permeation through the polymeric
network. We show that the permeation is an activated process following an
Arrhenius dependence on temperature. The potential energy profile responsible
for the activation process increases with tracer size, tracer bead interaction,
network rigidity and decreases with the driving force and confinement length. A
deeper energy barrier led to better efficiency to intercept the tracer
particles of a given size in the presence of driving force at room temperature.
Our studies may help to design mask with better efficiency.

<h3>Tuning arrays with rays: Physics-informed tuning of quantum dot charge  states</h3>

Quantum computers based on gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) are expected to
scale. However, as the number of qubits increases, the burden of manually
calibrating these systems becomes unreasonable and autonomous tuning must be
used. There have been a range of recent demonstrations of automated tuning of
various QD parameters such as coarse gate ranges, global state topology (e.g.
single QD, double QD), charge, and tunnel coupling with a variety of methods.
Here, we demonstrate an intuitive, reliable, and data-efficient set of tools
for automated global state and charge tuning in a framework deemed
physics-informed tuning (PIT). The first module of PIT is an action-based
algorithm that combines a machine learning (ML) classifier with physics
knowledge to navigate to a target global state. The second module uses a series
of one-dimensional measurements to tune to a target charge state by first
emptying the QDs of charge, followed by calibrating capacitive couplings, and
navigating to the target charge state. The success rate for the action-based
tuning consistently surpasses $95~\%$ on both simulated and experimental data
suitable for off-line testing. The success rate for charge setting is
comparable when testing with simulated data, at $95.5(5.4)~\%$, and only
slightly worse for off-line experimental tests, with an average of
$89.7(17.4)~\%$ (median $97.5~\%$). It's noteworthy that the high performance
is demonstrated both on data from samples fabricated in an academic cleanroom
as well as on an industrial 300 mm process line, further underlining the
device-agnosticity of PIT. Together, these tests on a range of simulated and
experimental devices demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PIT.

<br>
Since the discovery of a new family of vanadium-based kagome superconductor
AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, and Cs) with topological band structures, extensive effort has
been devoted to exploring the origin of superconducting states and the
intertwined orders. Meanwhile, searching for new types of superconductors with
novel physical properties and higher superconducting transition temperatures
has always been a major thread in the history of superconductor research. Here
we report a successful fabrication and the topological states of a
Titanium-based kagome metal CsTi3Bi5 (CT3B5) crystal. The as-grown CT3B5
crystal is of high quality and possesses a perfect two-dimensional kagome net
of Titanium. The superconductivity of the CT3B5 crystal shows that the critical
temperature Tc is of ~4.8 K. First-principle calculations predict that the
CT3B5 has robust topological surface states, implying that CT3B5 is a Z2
topological kagome superconductor. This finding provides a new type of
superconductors and the base for exploring the origin of superconductivity and
topological states in kagome superconductors.

<h3>Observation of coherent oscillations in association of dimers from a  thermal gas of ultracold atoms</h3>

<br>
We report the observation of coherent oscillations in conversion efficiency
of molecules formed from a thermal gas of ultracold atoms. Finite thermal
energy of the gas causes loss of coherence when a broad continuum is resonantly
coupled to a discrete bound state. Restoration of the coherence can be achieved
through non-adiabatic transitions of the dressed molecular energy level that
are induced by a strong modulation pulse with fast envelope dynamics.
Conditions to observe coherent oscillations are verified, and control of their
properties is demonstrated. The main experimental findings are supported by
theoretical modeling and numerical calculations.

<h3>Non-Hermitian spectral flows and Berry-Chern monopoles</h3>

<br>
<i>Lucien Jezequel, Pierre Delplace</i>
<br>
We propose a non-Hermitian generalization of the correspondence between the
spectral flow and the topological charges of band crossing points (Berry-Chern
monopoles). A class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that display a complex-valued
spectral flow is built by deforming an Hermitian model while preserving its
analytical index. We relate those spectral flows to a generalized Chern number
that we show to be equal to that of the Hermitian case, provided a line gap
exists. In the absence of a line gap, the system still displays a spectral flow
whose topology can be captured by exploiting an emergent pseudo-Hermitian
symmetry.

<h3>Heat capacity double transitions in time-reversal symmetry broken  superconductors</h3>

<br>
Standard superconductors display an ubiquitous discontinuous jump in the
electronic specific heat at the critical superconducting transition
temperature. In a growing class of unconventional superconductors, however, a
second order parameter component may get stabilized and produce a second heat
capacity jump at a lower temperature, typically associated with the spontaneous
breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The splitting of the two specific heat
discontinuities can be controlled by external perturbations such as chemical
substitution, hydrostatic pressure, or uniaxial strain. We develop a
theoretical quantitative multi-band framework to determine the ratio of the
heat capacity jumps, given the band structure and the order parameter momentum
structure. We discuss the conditions of the gap profile which determine the
amplitude of the second jump. We apply our formalism to the case of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, and using the gap functions from a microscopic RPA calculation,
we show that recently-proposed accidentally degenerate order parameters may
exhibit a strongly suppressed second heat capacity jump. We discuss the origin
of this result and consider also the role of spatial inhomogeneity on the
specific heat. Our results provide a possible explanation of why a second heat
capacity jump has so far evaded experimental detection in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

<h3>Perspective: non-Hermitian physics in magnetic systems</h3>

Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians provide an alternative perspective on the dynamics
of quantum and classical systems coupled non-conservatively to an environment.
Once primarily an interest of mathematical physicists, the theory of
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians has solidified and expanded to describe various
physically observable phenomena in optical, photonic, and condensed matter
systems. Self-consistent descriptions of quantum mechanics based on
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been developed and continue to be refined. In
particular, non-Hermitian frameworks to describe magnonic and hybrid magnonic
systems have gained popularity and utility in recent years, with new insights
into the magnon topology, transport properties, and phase transitions coming
into view. Magnonic systems are in many ways a natural platform in which to
realize non-Hermitian physics because they are always coupled to a surrounding
environment and exhibit lossy dynamics. In this perspective we review recent
progress in non-Hermitian frameworks to describe magnonic and hybrid magnonic
systems, such as cavity magnonic systems and magnon-qubit coupling schemes. We
discuss progress in understanding the dynamics of inherently lossy magnetic
systems as well as systems with gain induced by externally applied spin
currents. We enumerate phenomena observed in both purely magnonic and hybrid
magnonic systems which can be understood through the lens of non-Hermitian
physics, such as PT and Anti-PT-symmetry breaking, dynamical magnetic phase
transitions, non-Hermitian skin effect, and the realization of exceptional
points and surfaces. Finally, we comment on some open problems in the field and
discuss areas for further exploration.
