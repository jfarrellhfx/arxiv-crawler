Active particles driven by a chemical reaction are the subject of intense
research to date due to their rich physics, being intrinsically far from
equilibrium, and their multiple technological applications. Recent attention in
the field is now shifting towards exploring the fascinating dynamics of mixture
of active and passive systems. Here we realize active colloidal rafts, composed
of a single catalytic particle encircled by several shells of passive
microspheres assembled via light activated, chemophoretic flow. We show that
considering only diffusiophoresis can explain the cluster kinetics but not the
cluster propulsion behavior. Thus, using the Lorenz reciprocal theorem, we show
that propulsion emerges by considering hydrodynamics via the diffusioosmotic
answer of the substrate to the generated chemophoretic flow. While
diffusioosmotic flows are often relegate to a secondary role, our work
demonstrates their importance to understand the rich physics of active
catalytic systems.

<h3>Thermoosmosis of a near-critical binary fluid mixture: a general  formulation and universal flow direction</h3>

We consider a binary fluid mixture, which lies in the one-phase region near
the demixing critical point, and study its transport through a capillary tube
linking two large reservoirs. We assume that short-range interactions cause
preferential adsorption of one component on the tube's wall. The adsorption
layer can become much thicker than the molecular size, which enables us to
apply hydrodynamics based on a coarse-grained free-energy functional. For
linear transport phenomena induced by gradients of the pressure, composition,
and temperature along a cylindrical tube, we obtain the formulas of the Onsager
coefficients to extend our previous results on isothermal transport, assuming
the critical composition in the middle of each reservoir in the reference
equilibrium state. Among the linear transport phenomena, we focus on
thermoosmosis -- mass flow due to a temperature gradient. We explicitly derive
a formula for the thermal force density, which is nonvanishing in the
adsorption layer and causes thermoosmosis. This formula for a near-critical
binary fluid mixture is an extension of the conventional formula for a
one-component fluid, expressed in terms of local excess enthalpy. We predict
that the direction of thermoosmotic flow of a mixture near the upper (lower)
consolute point is the same as (opposite to) that of the temperature gradient,
irrespective of which component is adsorbed on the wall. Our procedure would
also be applied to dynamics of a soft material, whose mesoscopic inhomogeneity
can be described by a coarse-grained free-energy functional.

<h3>Anomalous crystalline-electromagnetic responses in semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10840" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10840</a>

<i>Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Oleg Dubinkin, Fiona J. Burnell, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a unifying framework that allows us to study the mixed
crystalline-electromagnetic responses of topological semimetals in spatial
dimensions up to $D = 3$ through dimensional augmentation and reduction
procedures. We show how this framework illuminates relations between the
previously known topological semimetals, and use it to identify a new class of
quadrupolar nodal line semimetals for which we construct a lattice
tight-binding Hamiltonian. We further utilize this framework to quantify a
variety of mixed crystalline-electromagnetic responses, including several that
have not previously been explored in existing literature, and show that the
corresponding coefficients are universally proportional to weighted
momentum-energy multipole moments of the nodal points (or lines) of the
semimetal. We introduce lattice gauge fields that couple to the crystal
momentum and describe how tools including the gradient expansion procedure,
dimensional reduction, compactification, and the Kubo formula can be used to
systematically derive these responses and their coefficients. We further
substantiate these findings through analytical physical arguments, microscopic
calculations, and explicit numerical simulations employing tight-binding
models.

<h3>Extrinsic and intrinsic effects setting viscosity in life processes:  implications for fundamental physical constants</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10863" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10863</a>

<i>K. Trachenko, P. G. Tello, S. A. Kauffman, S. Succi</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding the values and origin of fundamental physical constants, one of
the grandest challenges in modern science, has been discussed in particle
physics, astronomy and cosmology. More recently, it was realised that
fundamental constants have a bio-friendly window set by life processes
involving motion and flow. This window is related to intrinsic fluid properties
such as energy and length scales in condensed matter set by fundamental
constants. Here, we discuss important extrinsic factors governing the viscosity
of complex fluids operating in life processes due to collective effects. We
show that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting viscosity need to be
taken into account when estimating the bio-friendly range of fundamental
constants from life processes, and our discussion provides a straightforward
recipe for doing this. We also find that the relative role of extrinsic and
intrinsic factors depends on the range of variability of these intrinsic and
extrinsic factors. Remarkably, the viscosity of a complex fluid such as blood
with significant extrinsic effects is not far from the intrinsic viscosity
calculated using the fundamental constants only, and we discuss the reason for
this in terms of dynamics of contact points between cells.

<h3>A comparison of the hidden order transition in URu$_2$Si$_2$ to the  $λ$-transition in $^4$He</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10872</a>

<br>
<br>
The low-temperature states of ambient URu$_2$Si$_2$ and superfluid $^4$He are
both characterized by momentum-dependent energy gaps between the ground and
excited states. This behavior weakly persists even above the transitions
temperatures but becomes over-damped because of the number of excitations
present at elevated temperature. We show that akin to the normal fluid to
superfluid transition in $^4$He, the hidden-order (HO) transition in
URu$_2$Si$_2$ can be understood by a change of the gapped transitions to
elementary excitations (EE) of the unknown ordered state. These underdamped EEs
reflect the basic character and order parameters of the different phase
transitions. This view accounts for the full amount of entropy released in
these transitions, the jumps in the resistivity and thermal conductivity
directly below the transition, as well as the reduction of the Fermi surface.
We argue that the behavior in the HO phase is that of a gas of weakly
interacting excitations from charge density wave or crystal field states in a
similar manner to that of the phonon-roton excitations of the superfluid $^4$He
phase. We discuss the influence of applying pressure and magnetic fields within
this scenario and the role of the small moment antiferromagnetic clustering in
the hidden order phase.

<h3>Effect of interatomic repulsion on Majorana zero modes in a coupled  quantum-dot-superconducting-nanowire hybrid system</h3>

<br>
We study the low-energy eigenstates of a topological superconductor wire
modeled by a Kitaev chain coupled at one of its ends to a quantum dot by
nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping and NN Coulomb repulsion. Using an unrestricted
Hartree-Fock approximation to decouple the Coulomb term, we obtain that the
quality of the Majorana end states is seriously affected by this term only when
the dependence of the low-lying energies with the energy of the quantum dot
shows a "diamond" shape, characteristic of short wires.

<h3>Anomalous microwave response in the dissipative regime of topological  superconducting devices based on Bi2Te2.3Se0.7</h3>

Superconducting proximity junctions based on topological insulators are
widely believed to harbor Majorana-like bound states. The latter serves as a
paradigm non-local topological quantum computation protocols. Nowadays, a
search for topological phases in different materials, perspective for a
realization of topological qubits, is one of the central efforts in quantum
physics. It is motivated, in particular, by recent observation of anomalous ac
Josephson effect, which being a signature of Majorana physics. Its
manifestations, such as a fractional Josephson frequency and the absence of the
first (or several odd in more rare cases), Shapiro steps, were reported for
different materials. Here we study Shapiro steps in Nb/Bi2Te2.3Se0.7/Nb
junctions, based on ultrasmall single crystals of a 3D topological insulator
synthesized by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique. We present evidence
that our junctions are ballistic. When subjected to microwave radiation, the
junctions exhibit Shapiro steps, but the first step is missing. Typically it is
assumed that the missing first step (MFS) effect cannot be observed in the
presence of quasiparticle poisoning due to suppression of the 4{\pi}-periodic
component. Our findings within the context of the RSJ-model of Josephson
junction dynamics show that such behaviour of samples corresponds to a specific
condition, requiring a minimum of 5% of the 4{\pi}-component for disappearance
of the first Shapiro step.

In the cuprate superconductors, superconductivity often co-exists with other
types of order, including charge density wave and nematic orders. Over the past
decade, resonant x-ray scattering has emerged as a key tool to investigate
these competing/coexisting orders, providing valuable insights into their
microscopic character. In this report we provide a brief review of the
technique and highlight selected recent advances in study charge density wave
order and nematic order in the cuprates.

<h3>Phototactic bioconvection with the effect of oblique collimated flux at  forward scattering algae suspension in rotating medium</h3>

<br>
<i>S. K. Rajput</i>
<br>
<br>
The primary objective of this article is to explore how rotation influences
the initiation of phototactic bioconvection. This investigation is conducted
through the application of linear stability theory to a suspension composed of
forward-scattering phototactic algae. The suspension is uniformly exposed to
oblique collimated flux. The bioconvection phenomenon is characterized by an
unstable disturbance mode that undergoes a transition from a stationary state
to an oscillatory state as the Taylor number varies while keeping other
parameters constant. Additionally, it is noteworthy that rotation of the system
has a substantial stabilizing effect on the suspension.

We have performed hardness measurement experiments under different loads and
loading times by performing micro-indentation marks in the present work.
Chalcogenide glasses (ChGs) comprising Se$_{78}$Te$_{20}$Sn$_2$ and
Se$_{78-x}$Te$_{20}$Sn$_2$Zn$_x$ (where $x = 0, 2, 4, 6$) alloys are the
subject of micro-indentation tests in this work. We have utilized both
micro-indentation and optical microscopic methods to determine Vickers
hardness. Thermal glass transition phenomena have been identified through DSC
techniques. The modulus of elasticity (E), an essential mechanical property,
has been evaluated using established empirical equations. Further, we have
studied other mechanical parameters [e.g., minimal micro-void formation energy
(Eh), glass's fragility index (m), micro-void volume (Vh), etc.] and the
covalent character of the glassy system. Additionally, various physical
parameters, including density, molar volume, and compactness, have also been
determined.

<h3>Motility Induced Phase Separation and Frustration in Active Matter  Swarmalators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10937</a>
<br>
<i>B. Adorjani, A. Libal, C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a system of active matter swarmalators composed of elastically
interacting run-and-tumble active disks with an internal phase $\phi_i$. The
disks experience an additional attractive or repulsive force with neighboring
disks depending upon their relative difference in $\phi_i$. In the absence of
the internal phase, the system forms a Motility-Induced Phase Separated (MIPS)
state, but when the swarmalator interactions are present, a wide variety of
other active phases appear depending upon whether the interaction is attractive
or repulsive and whether the particles act to synchronize or anti-synchronize
their internal phase values. These include a gas-free gel regime, arrested
clusters, a labyrinthine state, a regular MIPS state, a frustrated MIPS state
for attractive anti-synchronization, and a superlattice MIPS state for
attractive synchronization.

<h3>Biaxial Strain Enhances Electron Mobility of Monolayer Transition Metal  Dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strain engineering can modulate the material properties of two-dimensional
(2D) semiconductors for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Recent
theory and experiments have found that uniaxial tensile strain can improve the
electron mobility of monolayer MoS$_2$, a 2D semiconductor, but the effects of
biaxial strain on charge transport are not well-understood in 2D
semiconductors. Here, we use biaxial tensile strain on flexible substrates to
probe the electron mobility in monolayer WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ transistors. This
approach experimentally achieves ~2x higher on-state current and mobility with
~0.3% applied biaxial strain in WS$_2$, the highest mobility improvement at the
lowest strain reported to date. We also examine the mechanisms behind this
improvement through density functional theory simulations, concluding that the
enhancement is primarily due to reduced intervalley electron-phonon scattering.
These results underscore the role of strain engineering 2D semiconductors for
flexible electronics, sensors, integrated circuits, and other opto-electronic
applications.

<h3>Deconfined quantum criticality with emergent symmetry in the extended  Shastry-Sutherland model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the exotic critical phenomena observed in the Shastry-Sutherland
material $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$ \blue{[Jimenez {\it et al}, Nature {\bf 592}, 370
(2021); Cui {\it et al}, Science {\bf 380}, 1179 (2023)]}, we investigate the
ground state nature of the extended Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) by the
state-of-the-art 2D tensor network method. Via large-scale simulations up to
$20\times 20$ sites, we identify a continuous phase transition between the
plaquette valence-bond solid (PVBS) phase and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase
accompanied by an emergent O(4) symmetry, which strongly suggests a deconfined
quantum critical point (DQCP). Furthermore, we map out the phase diagram of the
extended SSM and observe the same type of DQCP phenomena with emergent O(4)
symmetry and similar critical exponents along the whole critical line. Our
results indicate a compelling scenario for understanding the origin of the
proximate DQCP observed in recent experiments.

<br>
<br>
Stacking monolayer semiconductors results in moir\'e patterns that host many
correlated and topological electronic phenomena, but measurements of the basic
electronic structure underpinning these phenomena are scarce. Here, we
investigate the properties of the conduction band in moir\'e heterobilayers
using submicron angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with electrostatic
gating, focusing on the example of WS2/WSe2. We find that at all twist angles
the conduction band edge is the K-point valley of the WS2, with a band gap of
1.58 +- 0.03 eV. By resolving the conduction band dispersion, we observe an
unexpectedly small effective mass of 0.15 +- 0.02 m_e. In addition, we observe
replicas of the conduction band displaced by reciprocal lattice vectors of the
moir\'e superlattice. We present arguments and evidence that the replicas are
due to modification of the conduction band states by the moir\'e potential
rather than to final-state diffraction. Interestingly, the replicas display an
intensity pattern with reduced, 3-fold symmetry, which we show implicates the
pseudo vector potential associated with in-plane strain in moir\'e band
formation.

<h3>Concentration Dependence of Elastic and Viscoelastic Properties of  Aqueous Solutions of Ficoll and Bovine Serum Albumin by Brillouin Light  Scattering Spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
The cellular environment is crowded with macromolecules of different shapes
and sizes. The effect of this macromolecular crowding has been studied in a
variety of synthetic crowding environments: two popular examples are the
compact colloid-like Ficoll macromolecule, and the globular protein bovine
serum albumin (BSA). Recent studies have indicated a significant component of
bound or surface-associated water in these crowders reduces the available free
volume. In this work, Brillouin light scattering experiments were performed on
aqueous solutions of Ficoll 70 and Ficoll 400 with concentrations ranging from
1 wt% to 35 wt% and BSA with concentrations of 1 wt% to 27 wt%. From the
dependence of spectral peak parameters on polymer concentration, we determined
fundamental solution properties: hypersound velocity, adiabatic bulk modulus
and compressibility, apparent viscosity, and hypersound attenuation. Existing
theory that ignores intermolecular interactions can only capture the observed
linear trends in the frequency shift up to a threshold concentration, beyond
which a quadratic term accounting for intermolecular interactions is necessary.
This likely indicates a transition from the dilute to semi-dilute regime. In
the Ficoll solutions (but not BSA) we see evidence for a central mode, with a
characteristic relaxation time of 20 ps, that we attribute to exchange of the
bound water.

<h3>Giant interfacial spin-Hall angle from Rashba-Edelstein effect revealed  by the spin-Hall Hanle processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10985" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10985</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Li, Andrew H. Comstock, Aeron McConnell, Dali Sun, Xiaoshan Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
The Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE), which generates interfacial spin
polarization and subsequent spin current, is a compelling spin-charge
conversion mechanism for spintronics applications, since it is not limited by
the elemental spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we demonstrate REE at
Pt/ferroelectric interfaces using the recently elucidated spin-Hall Hanle
effects (SHHE), in which a Larmor precession of spin polarization in a
diffusion process from the interface manifest as magnetoresistance and Hall
effect. We show that REE leads to a three-fold enhancement of the effective
spin Hall angle in ferroelectric interface Pt/h-LuFeO3 compared to that of Pt
/Al2O3, although the difference in the spin relaxation time is negligible.
Modeling using SHHEs involving REE as an additional source of interfacial
polarization suggests that REE can lead to an interfacial spin Hall angle
(~0.3) that is one order of magnitude larger than the bulk value of Pt. Our
results demonstrate that a ferroelectric interface can produce large
spin-charge conversion and that SHHEs are a sensitive tool for characterizing
interfacial spin transport properties.

Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) techniques are widely used for
investigating lattice thermal conductivity. Recently, machine learning force
fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the precision in
NEMD simulations. This study is aimed at demonstrating the potential of MLFFs
in realizing NEMD calculations for large-scale systems containing over 100,000
atoms with density functional theory (DFT)-level accuracy. Specifically, the
atomic cluster expansion (ACE) force field is employed, using Si as an example.
The ACE potential incorporates 4-body interactions and features a training
dataset consisting of 1000 order structures from first-principles molecular
dynamics calculations, resulting in a highly accurate vibrational spectrum.
Moreover, the ACE potential can reproduce thermal conductivity values
comparable with those derived from DFT calculations via the Boltzmann equation.
To demonstrate the application of MLFFs to systems containing over 100,000
atoms, NEMD simulations are conducted on thin films ranging from 100 nm to 500
nm, with the 100 nm films exhibiting defect rates of up to 1.5%. The results
show that the thermal conductivity deviates by less than 5% from DFT or
theoretical results in both scenarios, which highlights the ability of the ACE
potential in calculating the thermal conductivity on a large scale with
DFT-level accuracy. The proposed approach is expected to promote the
application of MLFFs in various fields and serve as a feasible alternative to
virtual experiments. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential of MLFFs
in enhancing the accuracy of NEMD simulations for investigating lattice thermal
conductivity for systems with over 100,000 atoms.

The A15 structure of superconductors is a prototypical type-II superconductor
that has generated considerable interest since the early history of
superconducting materials. This paper discusses the superconducting properties
of previously unreported V3-xCoxSi alloys. It is found that the lattice
parameter decreases with increasing cobalt-doped content and leads to an
increased residual resistivity ratio (RRR) value of the V3-xCoxSi system.
Meanwhile, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) cobalt-doped
content. Furthermore, the fitted data show that the increase of cobalt-doped
content also reduces the lower/upper critical fields of the V3-xCoxSi system.
Type-II superconductivity is demonstrated on all V3-xCoxSi samples. With higher
Co-doped content, V3-xCoxSi alloys may have superconducting and structural
phase transitions at low-temperature regions. As the electron/atom (e/a) ratio
increases, the Tc variation trend of V3Si is as pronounced as in crystalline
alloys and monotonically follows the trend observed for amorphous
superconductors.

<h3>Gauge Theories of Josephson Junction Arrays: Why Disorder Is Irrelevant  for the Electric Response of Disordered Superconducting Films</h3>

<br>
We review the topological gauge theory of Josephson junction arrays and thin
film superconductors, stressing the role of the usually forgotten quantum phase
slips, and we derive their quantum phase structure. A quantum phase transition
from a superconducting to the dual, superinsulating phase with infinite
resistance (even at finite temperatures) is either direct or goes through an
intermediate bosonic topological insulator phase, which is typically also
called Bose metal. We show how, contrary to a widely held opinion, disorder is
not relevant for the electric response in these quantum phases because
excitations in the spectrum are either symmetry-protected or neutral due to
confinement. The quantum phase transitions are driven only by the electric
interaction growing ever stronger. First, this prevents Bose condensation, upon
which out-of-condensate charges and vortices form a topological quantum state
owing to mutual statistics interactions. Then, at even stronger couplings, an
electric flux tube dual to Abrikosov vortices induces a linearly confining
potential between charges, giving rise to superinsulation.

We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions
that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be
rewritten in terms of local one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate
the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of
strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest
eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the
phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we
address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative
compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy
functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and
offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated
complex systems.

The combination of a superconductor (SC) and a topological insulator (TI)
nanowire was proposed as a potential candidate for realizing Majorana zero
modes (MZMs). In this study, we adopt the Schr\"odinger-Poisson formalism to
incorporate the electrostatic environment inside the nanowire and
systematically explore its topological properties. Our calculations reveal that
the proximity to the SC induces a band bending effect, leading to a non-uniform
potential across the TI nanowire. As a consequence, there is an upward shift of
the Fermi level within the conduction band. This gives rise to the coexistence
of surface and bulk states, localized in an accumulation layer adjacent to the
TI-SC interface. When magnetic flux is applied, these occupied states have
different flux-penetration areas, suppressing the superconducting gap. However,
this impact can be mitigated by increasing the radius of the nanowire. Finally,
We demonstrate that MZMs can be achieved across a wide range of parameters
centered around one applied flux quantum, $\phi_0 = h/2e$. Within this regime,
MZMs can be realized even in the presence of conduction bands, which are not
affected by the band bending effect. These findings provide valuable insights
into the practical realization of MZMs in TI nanowire-based devices, especially
in the presence of a complicated electrostatic environment.

Magnetic damping has a significant impact on the performance of various
magnetic and spintronic devices, making it a long-standing focus of research.
The strength of magnetic damping is usually quantified by the Gilbert damping
constant in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Here we propose a
first-principles based approach to evaluate the Gilbert damping constant
contributed by spin-lattice coupling in magnetic insulators. The approach
involves effective Hamiltonian models and spin-lattice dynamics simulations. As
a case study, we applied our method to Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, MnFe$_2$O$_4$ and
Cr$_2$O$_3$. Their damping constants were calculated to be $0.8\times10^{-4}$,
$0.2\times10^{-4}$, $2.2\times 10^{-4}$, respectively at a low temperature. The
results for Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ and Cr$_2$O$_3$ are in good agreement with
experimental measurements, while the discrepancy in MnFe$_2$O$_4$ can be
attributed to the inhomogeneity and small band gap in real samples. The
stronger damping observed in Cr$_2$O$_3$, compared to Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$,
essentially results from its stronger spin-lattice coupling. In addition, we
confirmed a proportional relationship between damping constants and the
temperature difference of subsystems, which had been reported in previous
studies. These successful applications suggest that our approach serves as a
promising candidate for estimating the Gilbert damping constant in magnetic
insulators.

<br>
<br>
Spin-current density functional theory (SCDFT) is a formally exact framework
designed to handle the treatment of interacting many-electron systems including
spin-orbit coupling at the level of the Pauli equation. In practice, robust and
accurate calculations of the electronic structure of these systems call for
functional approximations that depend not only on the densities, but also on
spin-orbitals. Here we show that the call can be answered by resorting to an
extension of the Kohn-Sham formalism, which admits the use of non-local
effective potentials, yet it is firmly rooted in SCDFT. The power of the
extended formalism is demonstrated by calculating the spin-orbit-induced
band-splittings of inversion-asymmetric MoSe$_2$ monolayer and
inversion-symmetric bulk $\alpha$-MoTe$_2$. We show that quantitative agreement
with experimental data is obtainable via global hybrid approximations by
setting the fraction of Fock exchange at the same level which yields accurate
values of the band gap. Key to these results is the ability of the method to
self-consistently account for the spin currents induced by the spin-orbit
interaction. The widely used method of refining spin-density functional theory
by a second-variational treatment of spin-orbit coupling is unable to match our
SCDFT results.

The recent synthesis of MoSi2N4 material, along with theoretical predictions
encompassing the entire family of chemical analogs, has opened up a new array
of low-dimensional materials for a diverse range of optoelectronics and
photovoltaics applications. In this study, we conducted state-of-the-art
many-body first-principles calculations to analyze the quasi-particle
electronic structure of the material class MSi2Z4 (where M = Mo, W, and Z = N,
P, As, Sb). All monolayers display a direct band gap at the K point, with the
exception of MoSi2N4. In tungsten-based compounds, the fundamental-gap can be
adjusted over a significantly broader energy range compared to their
molybdenum-based counterparts. Additionally, increasing atomic weight of the Z,
both the band gap and exciton binding energies decrease. A noteworthy feature
is the absence of a lateral valley ({\Lambda} or Q) near the conduction band
minimum, indicating potential higher photoluminescence efficiencies compared to
conventional transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers. The optical spectra of
these materials are predominantly characterized by tightly bound excitons,
leading to an absorption onset in the visible range (for N-based) and in the
infrared region (for others). This diversity offers promising opportunities to
incorporate these materials and their heterostructures into optoelectronic
devices, with tandem solar cells being particularly promising.

Droplet coalescence is ubiquitous in nature and the same time key to various
technologies, such as inkjet printing. Here, we report on the coalescence of
polymer droplets with different chain lengths coalescing on substrates of
different wettability. By means of molecular dynamics simulations of a
coarse-grained model, it is found that the rate of bridge growth is higher in
the case of droplets with smaller contact angles (more wettable substrates) and
decreases with the increase of the chain length of the polymers. Different
behavior has also been identified in the dynamics of the approach of the two
droplets during coalescence with the substrate wettability playing a more
important role compared to the chain length of the polymers. While the dynamics
of the droplet are greatly affected by the latter parameters, the density
profile and flow patterns remain the same for the different cases. Thus, we
anticipate that our work provides further insights into the coalescence of
liquid polymer droplets on solid substrates with implications for relevant
technologies.

<h3>Noise-induced transition from superfluid to vortex state in  two-dimensional nonequilibrium polariton condensates -- semi-analytical  treatment</h3>

<br>
<br>
We develop a semi-analytical description for the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) like phase transition in nonequilibrium
Bose-Einstein condensates. Our theoretical analysis is based on a noisy
generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Above a critical strength of the noise,
spontaneous vortex-antivortex pairs are generated. We provide a semi-analytical
determination of the transition point based on a linearized Bogoliubov
analysis, to which some nonlinear corrections are added. We present two
different approaches that are in agreement with our numerical calculations in a
wide range of system parameters. We find that for small losses and not too
small energy relaxation, the critical point approaches that of the equilibrium
BKT transition. Furthermore, we find that losses tend to stabilize the ordered
phase: keeping the other parameters constant and increasing the losses leads to
a higher critical noise strength for the spontaneous generation of
vortex-antivortex pairs. Our theoretical analysis is relevant for experiments
on microcavity polaritons.

We consider thermoosmosis of a near-critical binary fluid mixture, lying in
the one-phase region, through a capillary tube in the presence of preferential
adsorption of one component. The critical composition is assumed in the two
reservoirs linked by the tube. With coarse-grained approach, we evaluate the
flow field induced by the thermal force density. We predict a universal
property; if the mixture is near the upper (lower) consolute point, the flow
direction is the same as (opposite to) the direction of the temperature
gradient, irrespective of which component is adsorbed onto the wall.

Cell populations are often characterised by phenotypic heterogeneity in the
form of two distinct subpopulations. We consider a model of tumour cells
consisting of two subpopulations: non-cancer promoting (NCP) and
cancer-promoting (CP). Under steady state conditions, the model has
similarities with a well-known model of population genetics which exhibits a
purely noise-induced transition from unimodality to bimodality at a critical
value of the noise intensity $\sigma^2$. The noise is associated with a
parameter $\lambda$ representing the system-environment coupling. In the case
of the tumour model, $\lambda$ has a natural interpretation in terms of the
tissue microenvironment which has considerable influence on the phenotypic
composition of the tumour. Oncogenic transformations give rise to considerable
fluctuations in the parameter. We compute the $\lambda-\sigma^2$ phase diagram
in a stochastic setting, drawing analogies between bifurcations and phase
transitions. In the region of bimodality, a transition from a state of balance
to a state of dominance, in terms of the competing subpopulations, occurs at
$\lambda=0$. Away from this point, the NCP (CP) subpopulation becomes dominant
as $\lambda$ changes towards positive (negative) values. The variance of the
steady state probability density function as well as two entropic measures
provide characteristic signatures at the transtion point.

We study the influence of the antiferromagnetic order on the surface states
of topological insulators. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for these states,
taking into account the space structure of the antiferromagnetic ordering. We
obtain a typical (gapless) Dirac Hamiltonian for the surface states if the
surface of the sample is not perturbed. However, a shift in the chemical
potential of the surface layer opens a gap in the spectrum away from Fermi
energy. Such a gap arises only in systems with a finite antiferromagnetic
order. We observe that the gap is robust against the surface disorder. The
obtained results are consistent with the recent experiments and density
functional theory calculations.

Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of
ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit.
Recently, evidence of the first purely two-dimensional multiferroic material
was reported in monolayer NiI$_2$. However, probing multiferroicity with
scattering-based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials,
and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the
multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, we use scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) supported by theoretical calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in
monolayer NiI$_2$. We demonstrate that the type-II multiferroic order displayed
by NiI$_2$, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a
strong spin-orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM
experiments. Moreover, we directly probe the magnetoelectric coupling of
NiI$_2$ by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains.
Our findings establish a novel point of view to analyse magnetoelectric effects
at the microscopic level, paving the way towards engineering new multiferroic
orders in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures.

Conventional photoemission orbital tomography based on Fourier iterative
method enables us to extract a projected two-dimensional (2D) molecular orbital
from a 2D photoelectron momentum map (PMM) of planar $\pi$-conjugated molecules
in a single-orientation system, while not in a multi-orientation system. In
this work, we demonstrate photoemission orbital tomography for $\pi$-conjugated
molecules with a tight-binding ansatz (linear combination of atomic orbitals).
We analyze 2D PMMs of single-orientation pentacene/Ag(110) and
multi-orientation 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride/Ag(110) and
reproduce their three-dimensional highest occupied molecular orbitals. We
demonstrate that the PhaseLift algorithm can be used to analyze PMM including
experimental or theoretical uncertainties. With the 2D PMM for pentacene, we
simultaneously optimized the structure and the molecular orbital. The present
approach enables us to extract the three-dimensional orbitals and structures of
existing materials.

Topological materials confined in one-dimension (1D) can transform computing
technologies, such as 1D topological semimetals for nanoscale interconnects and
1D topological superconductors for fault-tolerant quantum computing. As such,
understanding crystallization of 1D-confined topological materials is critical.
Here, we demonstrate 1D-confined crystallization routes during
template-assisted nanowire synthesis where we observe diameter-dependent phase
selectivity for topological metal tungsten phosphides. A phase bifurcation
occurs to produce tungsten monophosphide and tungsten diphosphide at the
cross-over nanowire diameter of ~ 35 nm. Four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy was used to identify the two phases and to map
crystallographic orientations of grains at a few nm resolution. The 1D-confined
phase selectivity is attributed to the minimization of the total surface
energy, which depends on the nanowire diameter and chemical potentials of
precursors. Theoretical calculations were carried out to construct the
diameter-dependent phase diagram, which agrees with experimental observations.
Our find-ings suggest a new crystallization route to stabilize topological
materials confined in 1D.

<h3>Quantifying nematic order in evaporation-driven self-assembly of  Halloysite nanotubes: Nematic islands and critical aspect ratio</h3>

<br>
<i>Arun Dadwal, Meenu Prasher, Pranesh Sengupta, Nitin Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are naturally occurring clay minerals found in
Earth's crust that typically exist in the form of high aspect-ratio
nanometers-long rods. Here, we investigate the evaporation-driven self-assembly
process of HNTs and show that a highly polydisperse collection of HNTs
self-sort into a spatially inhomogeneous structure, displaying a systematic
variation in the resulting nematic order. Through detailed quantification using
nematic order parameter $S$ and nematic correlation functions, we show the
existence of well-defined isotropic-nematic transitions in the emerging
structures. We also show that the onset of these transitions gives rise to the
formation of nematic islands - phase coexisting ordered nematic domains
surrounded by isotropic phase - which grow in size with $S$. Detailed image
analysis indicates a strong correlation between local $S$ and the local aspect
ratio, $L/D$, with nematic order possible only for rods with $L/D \ge 6.5 \pm
1$. Finally, we conclude that observed phenomena directly result from aspect
ratio-based sorting in our system. Altogether, our results provide a unique
method of tuning the local microscopic structure in self-assembled HNTs using
$L/D$ as an external parameter.

<h3>Transport-based fusion that distinguishes between Majorana and Andreev  bound states</h3>

<br>
<br>
It has proven difficult to distinguish between topological Majorana bound
states and nontopological Andreev bound states and to measure the unique
properties of the former. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by
proposing and theoretically analyzing a new type of fusion protocol based on
transport measurements in a Majorana box coupled to normal leads. The protocol
is based on switching between different nanowire pairs being tunnel coupled to
one of the leads. For a Majorana system, this leads to switching between
different states associated with parity blockade. The charge being transmitted
at each switch provides a measurement of the Majorana fusion rules.
Importantly, the result is different for a system with nontopological Andreev
bound states. The proposed protocol only requires measuring a DC current
combined with fast gate-control of the tunnel couplings.

Time-periodic light field can dress the electronic states and lead to
light-induced emergent properties in quantum materials. While below-gap pumping
is regarded favorable for Floquet engineering, so far direct experimental
evidence of momentum-resolved band renormalization still remains missing. Here,
we report experimental evidence of light-induced band renormalization in black
phosphorus by pumping at photon energy of 160 meV which is far below the band
gap, and the distinction between below-gap pumping and near-resonance pumping
is revealed. Our work demonstrates light-induced band engineering upon
below-gap pumping, and provides insights for extending Floquet engineering to

We investigate the elastic energy stored in a filament pair as a function of
applied twist by measuring torque under prescribed end-to-end separation
conditions. We show that the torque increases rapidly to a peak with applied
twist when the filaments are initially separate, then decreases to a minimum as
the filaments cross and come into contact. The torque then increases again
while the filaments form a double helix with increasing twist. A nonlinear
elasto-geometric model that combines the effect of geometrical nonlinearities
with large stretching and self-twist is shown to capture the evolution of the
helical geometry, the torque profile, and the stored energy with twist. We find
that a large fraction of the total energy is stored in stretching the
filaments, which increases with separation distance and applied tension. We
find that only a small fraction of energy is stored in the form of bending
energy, and that the contribution due to contact energy is negligible. Our
study highlights the consequences of stretchablility on filament twisting which
is a fundamental topological transformation relevant to making ropes, tying
shoelaces, actuating robots, and the physical properties of entangled polymers.

<br>
<br>
In Green's function theory, the total energy of an interacting many-electron
system can be expressed in a variational form using the Klein or Luttinger-Ward
functionals. Green's function theory also naturally addresses the case where
the interacting system is embedded into a bath. This latter can then act as a
dynamical (i.e., frequency-dependent) potential, providing a more general
framework than that of conventional static external potentials. Notably, the
Klein functional includes a term of the form $\text{Tr}_\omega
\text{Ln}\left\{G_0^{-1}G\right\}$, where $\text{Tr}_\omega$ is the frequency
integration of the trace operator. Here, we show that using a sum-over-pole
representation for the Green's functions and the algorithmic-inversion method
one can obtain in full generality an explicit analytical expression for
$\text{Tr}_\omega \text{Ln}\left\{G_0^{-1}G\right\}$. This allows one, e.g., to
derive a variational expression for the Klein functional in the presence of an
embedding bath, or to provide an explicit expression of the RPA correlation
energy in the framework of the optimized effective potential.

<br>
<br>
The orientational dynamics of supercooled glycerol using molecular dynamics
simulations for temperatures ranging from 323 K to 253 K, is probed through
correlation functions of first and second ranks of Legendre polynomials,
pertaining respectively to dielectric spectroscopy (DS) and depolarized dynamic
light scattering (DDLS). The self, cross, and total correlation functions are
compared with relevant experimental data. The computations reveal the low
sensitivity of DDLS to cross-correlations, in agreement with what is found in
experimental work, and strengthen the idea of directly comparing DS and DDLS
data to evaluate the effect of cross-correlations in polar liquids. The
analysis of the net static cross-correlations and their spatial decomposition
shows that, although cross-correlations extend over nanometric distances, their
net magnitude originates, in the case of glycerol, from the first shell of
neighbouring molecules. Accessing the angular dependence of the static
correlation allows us to get a microscopic understanding of why the rank-1
correlation function is more sensitive to cross-correlation than its rank-2
counterpart.

We study deformation and defects in thin, flexible sheets with crystalline
order using a coarse-grained Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) model. The PFC model
describes crystals at diffusive timescales through a continuous periodic field
representing the atomic number density. In its amplitude expansion (APFC), a
coarse-grained description featuring slowly varying fields retaining lattice
deformation, elasticity, and an advanced description of dislocations is
achieved. We introduce surface PFC and APFC models in a convenient height
formulation encoding normal deformation. With this framework, we then study
general aspects of the buckling of strained sheets, defect nucleation on a
prescribed deformed surface, and out-of-plane relaxation near dislocations. We
benchmark and discuss our results by looking at the continuum limit for
buckling under elastic deformation, and at evidence from microscopic models for
deformation at defects and defect arrangements. We shed light on the
fundamental interplay between lattice distortion at dislocations and
out-of-plane deformation by looking at the effect of the annihilation of
dislocation dipoles. The scale-bridging capabilities of the devised mesoscale
framework are also showcased with the simulation of a representative thin sheet
hosting many dislocations.

The buckling of a soft elastic sample under growth or swelling has
highlighted a new interest in materials science, morphogenesis, and biology or
physiology. Indeed, the change of mass or volume is a common fact of any living
species, and on a scale larger than the cell size, a macroscopic view can help
to explain many features of common observation. Many morphologies of soft
materials result from the accumulation of elastic compressive stress due to
growth, and thus from the minimization of a nonlinear elastic energy. The
similarity between growth and compression of a piece of rubber has revived the
instability formalism of nonlinear elastic samples under compression, and in
particular Biot's instability. Here we present a modern treatment of this
instability in the light of complex analysis and demonstrate the richness of
possible profiles that an interface can present under buckling, even if one
restricts oneself to the two spatial dimensions. Special attention is given to
wrinkles, folds and cusps, a surprising observation in swelling gels or clays.
The standard techniques of complex analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory and
path-independent integrals are revisited to highlight the role of physical
parameters at the origin of the observed patterns below and above the Biot
threshold.

The selfenergy in Born approximation including exchange of interacting

The DFT-$\frac{1}{2}$ method is a band gap correction with GW precision at a
DFT computational cost. The method was also extended to correct the gap between
defect levels, allowing for the calculation of optical transitions. However,
this method fails when the atomic character of the occupied and unoccupied
defect levels are similar as we illustrate by two examples, the tetrahedral
hydrogen interstitial and the negatively charged vacancy in diamond. We solve
this problem by decoupling the effect of the occupied and unoccupied defect
levels and call this the decoupled DFT-$\frac{1}{2}$ method for defects.

The unparalleled energy efficiency of the brain is driving researchers to
seek out new brain-inspired (neuromorphic) computing paradigms. Artificial
aqueous ion channels are emerging as an exciting new platform for neuromorphic
computing, representing a departure from conventional solid-state devices by
directly mimicking the fluidic ion transport found in the brain. However,
despite recent interest, a tangible demonstration of neuromorphic computing
remains a challenge. Here we successfully perform neuromorphic reservoir
computing using easy to fabricate tapered microchannels that embed a conducting
network of fluidic nanochannels between colloids, which we show to be a novel
memristor (memory resistor). Remarkably, a wide range of typical conductance
memory timescales can easily be achieved by constructing channels of different
length, a unique and highly desirable feature. This work is inspired and
supported by a new theoretical model, which stems directly from traditional
diffusion-conduction equations and shows excellent agreement with the
experiments, predicting the features and relevant parameters presented here.
Our results represent a fundamental step in realising the promise of ion
channels as a new platform to emulate the rich aqueous dynamics of the brain.

Over the past years, one witnesses a growing interest in flat band (FB)
physics which has become a playground for exotic phenomena. In this study, we
address the FB superconductivity in onedimensional stub chain. In contrast to
the sawtooth chain or the creutz ladder, for a given strength of the attractive
electron-electron interaction, the stub chain allows the tuning of the real
space spreading of the FB eigenstates (quantum metric or QM). We study in
detail the interplay between the interaction strength and the mean value of the
QM \langle g \rangle on the pairings and on the superfluid weight D_s. Our
calculations reveal several interesting and intriguing features. For instance,
in the weak coupling regime, D_s with respect to \langle g \rangle exhibits two
different types of behaviour. Despite the fact that the pairings differs
drastically, D_s scales linearly with the QM only when its \langle g \rangle is
large enough (small gap limit). On the other hand, when the QM is of small
amplitude an unusual power law is found, more precisely D_s \propto \langle g
\rangle^\nu where \nu \longrightarrow 2 in the limit of large single particle
gap. In addition to the numerical calculations, we have provided several
analytical results which shed light on the physics in both the weak and strong
coupling regime. Finally, we have addressed the impact of the thermal
fluctuations on the superfluid weight.

Magnetic properties of multicomponent alloys depend sensitively on the degree
of atomic order on the different crystallographic sites. In this work we
demonstrate the magnetic contrast between bulk and thin-film samples of the
Heusler alloy V$_{2}$FeAl. Arc-melted bulk ingots show practically no site
preference of the elements (A2 structure), whereas magnetron-sputtered
thin-film samples display a higher degree of atomic ordering with a tendency
towards XA-type order. Electronic structure calculations favour ferrimagnetic
XA-type ordering, and the effect of different pairwise atomic disorder on the
element specific and net magnetic moments are evaluated to reproduce
experimental observations. XA-type thin-films with iron moment of 1.24
$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ determined by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism are in
agreement with calculation, but the measured net moment of 1.0
$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ per formula unit and average vanadium moment are smaller
than expected from calculations. The measured Curie temperature is
approximately 500 K. Films with a higher degree of disorder have a
T$_{\mathrm{C}}$ close to 300 K with a net moment of 0.1 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ at
low temperature. The large calculated vanadium moments are destroyed by partial
disorder on $4d$ vanadium sites. By contrast, the arc-melted and annealed bulk
alloy with a fully-disordered A2 structure shows no spontaneous magnetization;
it is a Pauli paramagnet with dimensionless susceptibility
$\chi_{\mathrm{v}}=-2.95\times10^{-4}$.

We explore Weyl and Dirac semimetals with tilted nodes as platforms for
realizing an intrinsic superconducting diode effect. Although tilting breaks
sufficient spatial and time-reversal symmetries, we prove that -- at least for
conventional $s$-wave singlet pairing -- the effect is forbidden by an emergent
particle-hole symmetry at low energies if the Fermi level is tuned to the
nodes. Then, as a stepping stone to the three-dimensional semimetals, we
analyze a minimal one-dimensional model with a tilted helical node using
Ginzburg-Landau theory. While one might naively expect a drastic enhancement of
the effect when the node turns from type-I to type-II, we find that the
presence of multiple Fermi pockets is more important as it enables multiple
pairing amplitudes with indepedent contributions to supercurrents in opposite
directions. Equipped with this insight, we construct minimal lattice models of
Weyl and Dirac semimetals and study the superconducting diode effect in them.
Once again, we see a substantial enhancement when the normal state has multiple
Fermi pockets per node that can accommodate more than one pairing channel. In
summary, this study sheds light on the key factors governing the intrinsic
superconducting diode effect in systems with asymmetric band structures and
paves the way for realizing it in topological semimetals.
