<h3>Electric and thermoelectric response for Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals  in planar Hall configurations including the effects of strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02318</a>

<br>
We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (thermal Hall)
configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is
subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (temperature
gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf
B^{\rm tot}$ oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The
effective magnetic field consists of two parts -- (a) an actual/physical
magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $
which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an
axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with
opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the
orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to
the direction of the electric field (temperature gradient) and elucidate how it
affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally,
we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles
strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.

<h3>Magnetic Property Control of Cr2Ge2Te6 Through Oxidation and Thickness  Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02319</a>

<br>
<br>
Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials such as Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) show promise
for novel memory and logic applications. This is due to their broadly tunable
magnetic properties and the presence of topological magnetic features such as
skyrmionic bubbles. A systematic study of thickness and oxidation effects on
magnetic domain structures is important for designing devices and vdW
heterostructures for practical applications. Here, we investigate thickness
effects on magnetic properties, magnetic domains, and bubbles in
oxidation-controlled CGT crystals. We find that CGT exposed to ambient
conditions for 30 days forms an oxide layer approximately 5 nm thick. This
oxidation leads to a significant increase in the oxidation state of the Cr
ions, indicating a change in local magnetic properties. This is supported by
real space magnetic texture imaging through Lorenz transmission electron
microscopy. By comparing the thickness dependent saturation field of oxidized
and pristine crystals, we find that oxidation leads to a non-magnetic surface
layer with a thickness of about 10 nm, thicker than the oxide layer alone. We
also find that the stripe domain width and skyrmionic bubble size are strongly
affected by the crystal thickness in pristine crystals. These findings
underscore the impact of thickness and surface oxidation on the properties of
CGT such as saturation field and domain/skyrmionic bubble size and suggest a
pathway for manipulating magnetic properties through a controlled oxidation
process.

<h3>Dynamical deconfinement transition driven by density of excitations</h3>

We investigate the deconfinement transition driven by excitations in
long-range spin models. At low temperatures, these models exhibit a confined
phase where domain-wall (or kinks) are localized. As temperature increases,
kinks interact and propagate, leading to a transition to a de-confined phase.
This transition is influenced by the interplay between thermal energy and
interaction effects, resulting in extended, de-confined regions. Although kinks
density is dynamically stable, non-equilibrium changes in their fluctuations
characterize the transition. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms
of confinement and deconfinement in long-range spin models, with implications
for both condensed matter physics and lattice gauge theories. Bridging these
fields, this study sheds light on the universal aspects of confinement and
opens avenues for further exploration and experimental verification.

Analog neuromorphic computing systems emulate the parallelism and
connectivity of the human brain, promising greater expressivity and energy
efficiency compared to digital systems. Though many devices have emerged as
candidates for artificial neurons and artificial synapses, there have been few
device candidates for artificial dendrites. In this work, we report on
biocompatible graphene-based artificial dendrites (GrADs) that can implement
dendritic processing. By using a dual side-gate configuration, current applied
through a Nafion membrane can be used to control device conductance across a
trilayer graphene channel, showing spatiotemporal responses of leaky recurrent,
alpha, and gaussian dendritic potentials. The devices can be variably connected
to enable higher order neuronal responses, and we show through data-driven
spiking neural network classification simulations that overall spiking activity
is reduced by up to 15% without accuracy loss while low frequency operation is
stabilized. This positions the GrADs as strong candidates for energy efficient
bio-interfaced spiking neural networks.

<h3>From asynchronous states to Griffiths phases and back: structural  heterogeneity and homeostasis in excitatory-inhibitory networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02369" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02369</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Balanced neural networks -- in which excitatory and inhibitory inputs
compensate each other on average -- give rise to a dynamical phase dominated by
fluctuations called asynchronous state, crucial for brain functioning. However,
structural disorder -- which is inherent to random networks -- can hinder such
an excitation-inhibition balance. Indeed, structural and synaptic
heterogeneities can generate extended regions in phase space akin to critical
points, called Griffiths phases, with dynamical features very different from
those of asynchronous states. Here, we study a neural-network model with
tunable levels of heterogeneity able to display these two types of dynamical
regimes -- i.e., asynchronous states and Griffiths phases -- putting them
together within a single phase diagram. Using this simple model, we are able to
emphasize the crucial role played by synaptic plasticity and homeostasis to
re-establish balance in intrinsically heterogeneous networks.

<h3>Crosslinker energy landscape effects on dynamic mechanical properties of  ideal polymer hydrogels</h3>

Reversible crosslinkers can enable several desirable mechanical properties,
such as improved toughness and self-healing, when incorporated in polymer
networks for bioengineering and structural applications. In this work, we
performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to investigate the effect of the
energy landscape of reversible crosslinkers on the dynamic mechanical
properties of crosslinked polymer network hydrogels. We report that, for an
ideal network, the energy potential of the crosslinker interaction drives the
viscosity of the network, where a stronger potential results in a higher
viscosity. Additional topographical analyses reveal a mechanistic understanding
of the structural rearrangement of the network as it deforms and indicate that
as the number of defects increases in the network, the viscosity of the network
increases. As an important validation for the relationship between the energy
landscape of a crosslinker chemistry and the resulting dynamic mechanical
properties of a crosslinked ideal network hydrogel, this work enhances our
understanding of deformation mechanisms in polymer networks that cannot easily
be revealed by experiment and reveals design ideas that can lead to better
performance of the polymer network at the macroscale.

<h3>Tailoring electronic properties on Bi$_2$O$_2$Se under surface  modification and magnetic doping</h3>

The search for a two-dimensional material that simultaneously fulfills some
properties for its use in spintronics and optoelectronics, i.e., a suitable
bandgap with high in-plane carrier mobility and good environmental stability,
is the focus of intense current research. If magnetism is also present, its
range of utility is considerably expanded. One of the promising materials
fulfilling these features is Bi$_2$O$_2$Se, a non van-der-Waals system whose
monolayer has been recently obtained. This study addresses the structure and
electronic properties of different monolayers that could be obtained
experimentally. It is observed that these monolayers are very sensitive to the
introduction of "extra" electrons, changing their electronic character from
semiconductor to conductor. Furthermore, we investigate how the properties of
each studied monolayer change when the system is doped with magnetic atoms. The
result is that the doping introduces bands of low dispersion caused by the d
orbitals of the impurities that can hybridize with the oxygen and bismuth atoms
in the monolayer. This strongly modifies the electronic properties of the
material, producing changes in the valence of certain Bi atoms which can induce
a symmetry breaking in the perpendicular plane. Such phenomena lead to metallic
or semiconducting characteristics, depending of metal doping.

<h3>Control of particle transport driven by active noise: strategy of  amplification via a periodic potential</h3>

We extend our previous studies on a counter-intuitive effect in which a
directed transport of a free Brownian particle induced by active fluctuations
can be significantly enhanced when the particle is placed in a periodic
potential. It is in clear contrast to a common situation when the velocity of
the Brownian particle is notably reduced if the periodic potential is switched
on. As a model of active fluctuations we employ white Poissonian shot noise. We
reconsider the case of the skew-normal amplitude distribution of shot noise and
focus on the impact of statistical characteristics of its amplitude like mean,
variance and skewness on the magnitude of free particle transport enhancement.
in particular, we detect intriguing oscillations of the rescaled velocity of
the particle as a function of the variance. Our findings can be corroborated
experimentally in both biological and artificial microscopic systems.

<h3>Controlling the size and adhesion of DNA droplets using surface-active  DNA molecules</h3>

Liquid droplets of biomolecules serve as organizers of the cellular interior
and are of interest in biosensing and biomaterials applications. Here, we
investigate means to tune the interfacial properties of a model biomolecular
liquid consisting of multi-armed DNA 'nanostar' particles. We find that long
DNA molecules that have binding affinity for the nanostars are preferentially
enriched on the interface of nanostar droplets, thus acting as surfactants.
Fluorescent measurements indicate that, in certain conditions, the interfacial
density of the surfactant is around 20 per square micron, indicative of a
sparse brush-like structure of the long, polymeric DNA. Increasing surfactant
concentration leads to decreased droplet size, down to the sub-micron scale,
consistent with arrest of droplet coalescence by the disjoining pressure
created by the brush-like surfactant layer. Added DNA surfactant also keeps
droplets from adhering to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic solid surfaces,
apparently due to this same disjoining effect of the surfactant layer. We thus
demonstrate control of the size and adhesive properties of droplets of a
biomolecular liquid, with implications for basic biophysical understanding of
such droplets, as well as for their applied use.

The packing geometry of macromolecules in complex mesophases is of key
importance to self-organization in synthetic and biological soft materials.
While approximate or heuristic models rely on often-untested assumptions about
how flexible molecules "fit in" to distinct locations of complex assemblies,
physical assemblies derive from ensembles of fluctuating conformations,
obscuring the connection between mesophase geometry and the underlying
arrangements. Here, we present an approach to extract and analyze features of
molecular packing in diblock block copolymer (BCP) melts, a prototypical soft
matter system, based on the statistical description of chain conformations in
self-consistent field (SCF) theory. We show how average BCP chain trajectories
in ordered morphologies can be analyzed from the SCF-derived orientational
order parameter of chain segments. We use these extracted trajectories to
analyze the features of local packing geometry, including chain bending and
tilt, as well as the terminal boundaries that delineate distinct domains in
ordered BCP morphologies. We illustrate this analysis by focusing on measurable
features of packing frustration in 2D (columnar) and 3D (spherical and
bicontinuous) morphologies, notably establishing an explicit link between chain
conformations in complex morphologies and their medial geometry.

<h3>The Effects of Ionic Strength on the Morphology, Scattering, and  Mechanical Response of Neurofilament-derived Protein Brushes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02463</a>

<br>
<br>
Protein brushes not only play a key role in the functionality of
neurofilaments but also have wide applications in biomedical materials. Here,
we investigate the effect of ionic strength on the morphology of protein
brushes using a continuous-space self-consistent field theory. A coarse-grained
multi-block charged macromolecular model is developed to capture the chemical
identity of amino acid sequences. For neurofilament heavy (NFH) brushes at pH
2.4, we predict three morphological regimes: swollen brushes, condensed
brushes, and coexisting brushes which consist of both a dense inner layer and a
diffuse outer layer. The brush height predicted by our theory is in
quantitative agreement with experimental data for a wide range of ionic
strengths. The dramatic height decrease is a result of the electrostatic
screening-induced transition from the overlapping state to the isolated state
of the coexisting brushes. We also study the evolution of the scattering and
mechanical responses accompanying the morphological change. The oscillation in
the reflectivity spectra characterizes the existence and microstructure of the
inner condensed layer, whereas the shoulder in the force spectra signifies the
swollen morphology.

<h3>Estimating viscoelastic, soft material properties using a modified  Rayleigh cavitation bubble collapse time</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02475</a>
<br>
<i>Jin Yang, Alexander McGhee, Griffin Radtke, Mauro Rodriguez Jr., Christian Franck</i>
<br>
<br>
Accurate determination of high strain rate (> 10^3 1/s) constitutive
properties of soft materials remains a formidable challenge. Albeit recent
advancements among experimental techniques, in particular inertial
microcavitation rheometry (IMR), the intrinsic requirement to visualize the
bubble cavitation dynamics has limited its application to nominally transparent
materials. Here, in an effort to address this challenge and to expand the
experimental capability of IMR to optically opaque materials, we investigated
whether one could use the acoustic signature of the time interval between
bubble nucleation and collapse, characterized as the bubble collapse time, to
infer the viscoelastic material properties without being able to image the
bubble directly in the tissue. By introducing a modified Rayleigh collapse time
for soft materials, which is strongly dependent on the stiffness of the
material at hand, we show that, in principle, one can obtain an order of
magnitude or better estimate of the viscoelastic material properties of the
soft material under investigation. Using a newly developed energy-based
theoretical framework, we show that for materials stiffer than 10 kPa the
bubble collapse time during a single bubble cavitation event can provide
quantitative and meaningful information about the constitutive properties of
the material at hand. For very soft materials (i.e., shear modulus less than 10
kPa) our theory shows that unless the collapse time measurement has very high
precision and low uncertainties, the material property estimates based on the
bubble collapse time only will not be accurate and require visual resolution of
the full cavitation kinematics.

<h3>Unidirectional Superconductivity and Diode Effect Induced by Dissipation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02539</a>
<br>
<i>Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase</i>
<br>
<br>
A general principle of condensed matter physics prohibits the electric
current in equilibrium. This prevents a zero-resistance state realized solely
under a finite electric current, namely the unidirectional superconductivity.
In this Letter, we propose a setup to realize the unidirectional
superconductivity as a nonequilibrium steady state. We focus on the in-plane
transport of atomically thin bilayer superconductors lacking the in-plane
inversion symmetry and introduce dissipation by applying the out-of-plane
electric field and current. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
equations, we show that locally stable steady-state solutions appear only under
the in-plane supercurrent when the out-of-plane electric field exceeds a
threshold value. Our system also realizes the dissipation-induced
superconducting diode effect up to 100% efficiency by purely electric means.

<h3>Magnetic field induces giant nonlinear optical response in Weyl  semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02578</a>
<br>
<i>Grigory Bednik, Vladyslav Kozii</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the second-order optical response of Weyl semimetals in the presence
of a magnetic field. We consider an idealized model of a perfectly linear Weyl
node and use the Kubo formula at zero temperature to calculate the intrinsic
contribution to photocurrent and second harmonic generation conductivity
components. We obtain exact analytical expressions applicable at arbitrary
values of frequency, chemical potential, and magnetic field. Our results show
that finite magnetic field significantly enhances the nonlinear optical
response in semimetals, while magnetic resonances lead to divergences in
nonlinear conductivity. In realistic systems, these singularities are
regularized by a finite scattering rate, but result in pronounced peaks which
can be detected experimentally, provided the system is clean and interactions
are weak. We also perform a semiclassical calculation that complements and
confirms our microscopic results at small magnetic fields and frequencies.

<h3>Low-energy electrodynamics of infinite-layer nickelates: evidence for  d-wave superconductivity in the dirty limit</h3>

The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates establishes a
new category of unconventional superconductors that share structural and
electronic similarities with cuprates. Despite exciting advances, such as the
establishment of a cuprate-like phase diagram and the observation of charge
order and short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuation, the key issues of
superconducting pairing symmetry, gap amplitude, and superconducting
fluctuation remain elusive. In this work, we utilize static and ultrafast
terahertz spectroscopy to address these outstanding problems. We demonstrate
that the equilibrium terahertz conductivity and nonequilibrium terahertz
responses of an optimally Sr-doped nickelate film ($T_c$ = 17 K) are in line
with the electrodynamics of $d$-wave superconductivity in the dirty limit. The
gap-to-$T_c$ ratio 2$\Delta/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{c}$ is extracted to be 3.4,
indicating the superconductivity falls in the weak-coupling regime. In
addition, we observed significant superconducting fluctuation near
$T_\mathrm{c}$, while it does not extend into the deep normal state as
optimally hole-doped cuprates. Our result highlights a new $d$-wave system
which closely resembles the electron-doped cuprates, expanding the family of
unconventional superconductivity in oxides.

<h3>Evidence for highly damped Higgs mode in infinite-layer nickelates</h3>

<br>
The dynamics of Higgs mode in superconductors, manifested as coherent
oscillations of the superconducting order parameter amplitude, provides vital
insights into the nature of the superconducting gap structure and symmetry.
Here we utilize two-dimensional terahertz coherent spectroscopy to investigate
Higgs dynamics of a newly discovered infinite-layer nickelate superconductor.
While we observe distinct nonlinear terahertz responses from the
superconducting state, well-defined long-lived Higgs modes, as commonly
observed in $s$-wave superconductors, are entirely absent in the nickelate
film. Instead, we find the coherent nonlinear terahertz response is dominated
by the quasiparticle excitations. These observations strongly indicate that the
Higgs mode in infinite-layer nickelates is heavily damped by the quasiparticle
excitations at arbitrarily low energies, which is a characteristic of $d$-wave
pairing symmetry. Additionally, by examining the temperature dependence of the
nonlinear terahertz response, we discover short-range superconducting
fluctuations in the vicinity of $T_\mathrm{c}$. Our findings provide proof of a
new $d$-wave system and establish a foundation for investigating the
unconventional superconductivity in nickelates.

<h3>A Molecular Theory for Liquid Crystal Elastomers: Nematic Ordering,  Shape Deformation and Mechanical Response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02636" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02636</a>
<br>
<i>Luofu Liu, Rui Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Modeling liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) at the molecular level is crucial
for the predictable design of energy-conversion and stimuli-responsive
materials. Here, we develop a self-consistent field theory for LCEs which
captures the coupling between nematic ordering, backbone alignment and network
deformation. Molecular features such as density of elastic strands, strength
and architecture of local chemical hinge, and LC grafting density are
systematically included. Crosslinking suppresses nematic ordering as a result
of the elastic energy stored during network deformation. Higher work capacity
can be achieved by less crosslinked LCEs. The spontaneous shape change of
end-on side-chain LCEs can be either elongation or contraction depending on the
competition between the local and global couplings. Adjusting LC grafting
density is found to be an effective way to fine-tune the deformation mode. We
elucidate a universal scaling relationship between the transition temperature
and the shear modulus as $T_{\rm NI,0}-T_{\rm NI}\sim {\mu^*}^{\frac{4}{5}}$.
Furthermore, we predict that the first-order nematic phase transition can be
degraded into a continuous manner upon applied stress. Coupled with nematic
ordering, the mechanical response of LCEs significantly deviates from classical
rubber elasticity. A plateau in the stress-deformation curve appears
accompanied by the nematic phase transition. Our theoretical predictions are in
good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.

<h3>Candidate quantum disordered intermediate phase in the Heisenberg  antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum antiferromagnets on geometrically frustrated lattices have long
attracted interest for the formation of quantum disordered states and the
possible emergence of quantum spin liquid ground states. Here we turn to the
nearest-neighbor spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf
lattice, which is known to relieve frustration by the formation of canted
$120^{\circ}$ magnetic order or valence bond crystal order when varying the
bond anisotropy. Employing a pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group
approach to assess its ground state phase diagram in detail, we present
evidence for a quantum spin liquid (QSL) regime sandwiched between these two
limiting phases. The formation of such a QSL might signal proximity to a
possible deconfined quantum critical point from which it emerges, and that is
potentially accessible by tuning the exchange couplings. Our conclusions are
based on large-scale simulations involving a careful finite-size scaling
analysis of the behavior of magnetic susceptibility and spin-spin correlation
functions under renormalization group flow.

<h3>Retardation Effects in Atom-Wall Interactions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The onset of retardation effects in atom-wall interactions is studied. It is
shown that the transition range from the 1/z^3 short-range (van der Waals)
interaction to the 1/z^4 long-range (Casimir) retarded interaction critically
depends on the atomic properties and on the dielectric function of the
material. For simple non-alkali atoms (e.g., ground-state hydrogen and
ground-state helium) interacting with typical dielectric materials such as
intrinsic silicon, the transition to the retarded regime is shown to proceed at
a distance of about 10 nm (200 Bohr radii). This is much shorter than typical
characteristic absorption wavelengths of solids. Larger transition regimes are
obtained for atoms with a large static polarizability such as metastable
helium. We present a simple estimate, z_crit=137*(\alpha(0)/Z)^(1/2) atomic
units, where alpha(0) is the static polarizability (expressed in atomic units)
and Z is the number of electrons of the atom.

Despite being a layered, easily-exfoliated compound, copper monotelluride
(CuTe) features an unusual quasi-one-dimensional charge density wave below
$T_{\rm CDW}\approx335$ K. Within a CuTe layer, the electrical resistivity
depends sensitively on the direction of the electrical current. Here, we use
magnetotransport to probe the metallic state of CuTe with two distinct in-plane
current directions. When the current flows along the $a$-axis ($I//a$), the
magnetoresistance exhibits a downward curvature as the magnetic field
increases. On the other hand, when the current is along the $b$-axis ($I//b$),
the magnetoresistance shows the opposite curvature. Our analysis uncovers a
violation of Kohler scaling, but only for $I//a$. Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations are detected at low temperatures. Our results shed light on the
nature of the metallic state in CuTe with the development of the charge density
wave.

<h3>Force renormalization for probes immersed in an active bath</h3>

<br>
<br>
Langevin equations or generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) are popular
models for describing the motion of a particle in a fluid medium in an
effective manner. Here we examine particles immersed in an inherently
nonequilibrium fluid, i.e., an active bath, which are subject to an external
force. Specifically, we consider two types of forces that are highly relevant
for microrheological studies: A harmonic, trapping force and a constant, "drag"
force. We study such systems by molecular simulations and use the simulation
data to derive an effective GLE description. We find that, in an active bath,
the external force in the GLE is not equal to the physical external force, but
rather a renormalized external force, which can be significantly smaller. The
effect cannot be attributed to the mere temperature renormalization, which is
also observed.

Optically addressable spin defects in three-dimensional (3D) crystals and

nanoscale quantum sensing. Spin defects in one-dimensional (1D) vdW nanotubes
will provide unique opportunities due to their small sizes in two dimensions
and absence of dangling bonds on side walls. However, optically detected
magnetic resonance of localized spin defects in a nanotube has not been
reported. Here, we report the observation of single optically addressable spin
defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) at room temperature. Our findings
suggest that these BNNT spin defects possess a spin $S=1/2$ ground state
without an intrinsic quantization axis, leading to orientation-independent
magnetic field sensing. We harness this unique feature to observe anisotropic
magnetization of a 2D magnet in magnetic fields along orthogonal directions, a
challenge for conventional spin $S=1$ defects such as diamond nitrogen-vacancy
centers. Additionally, we develop a method to deterministically transfer a BNNT
onto a cantilever and use it to demonstrate scanning probe magnetometry.
Further refinement of our approach will enable atomic scale quantum sensing of
magnetic fields in any direction.

Quasicrystals are fascinating and important because of their unconventional
atomic arrangements, which challenge traditional notions of crystalline
structures. Unlike regular crystals, they lack translational symmetry and
generate unique mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, holding promise
for numerous applications. In order to probe the electronic properties of
quasicrystals, tools beyond linear response transport measurements are needed,
since all spectral regions can be affected by the non-periodic geometry. Here
we show that high-harmonic spectroscopy offers an advanced avenue for this
goal. Focusing on the quasiperiodic 1D Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, we
leverage high-harmonic spectroscopy to delve into their intricate
characteristics: By carefully analyzing emitted harmonic intensities, we
extract the multifractal spectrum -- an essential indicator of the spatial
distribution of electronic states in quasicrystals. Additionally, we address
the detection of mobility edges, vital energy thresholds that demarcate
localized and extended eigenstates within generalized AAH models. The precise
identification of these mobility edges sheds light on the metal-insulator
transition and the behavior of electronic states near these boundaries. Merging
high-harmonic spectroscopy with the AAH model provides a powerful framework for
understanding the interplay between localization and extended states in
quasicrystals for an extremely wide energy range not captured within linear
response studies, thereby offering valuable insights for guiding future
experimental investigations.

<br>
The normal-state conductivity and superconducting critical temperature of
oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-x can be persistently enhanced by illumination.
Strongly debated for years, the origin of those effects -- termed persistent
photoconductivity (PPC) and photosuperconductivity (PPS) -- has remained an
unsolved critical problem, whose comprehension may provide key insights to
harness the origin of high-temperature superconductivity itself. Here we make
essential steps toward understanding PPS. While the models proposed so far
assume that it is caused by a carrier-density increase (photodoping) observed
concomitantly, our experiments contradict such conventional belief: we
demonstrate that it is instead linked to a photo-induced decrease of the
electronic scattering rate. Furthermore, we find that the latter effect and
photodoping are completely disconnected and originate from different
microscopic mechanisms since they present different wavelength and
oxygen-content dependencies as well as strikingly different relaxation
dynamics. Besides helping disentangle photodoping, PPC, and PPS, our results
provide new evidence for the intimate relation between critical temperature and
scattering rate, a key ingredient in modern theories on high-temperature
superconductivity.

We implement an experimental architecture in which a single atom of K is
trapped in an optical tweezer, and is immersed in a bath of Rb atoms at
ultralow temperatures. In this regime, the motion of the single trapped atom is
confined to the lowest quantum vibrational levels. This realizes an elementary
and fully controllable quantum impurity system. For the trapping of the K atom,
we use a species-selective dipole potential, that allows us to independently
manipulate the quantum impurity and the bath. We concentrate on the
characterization and control of the interactions between the two subsystems. To
this end, we perform Feshbach spectroscopy, detecting several inter-dimensional
confinement-induced Feshbach resonances for the KRb interspecies scattering
length, that parametrizes the strength of the interactions. We compare our data
to a theory for inter-dimensional scattering, finding good agreement. Notably,
we also detect a series of p-wave resonances stemming from the underlying
free-space s-wave interactions. We further determine how the resonances behave
as the temperature of the bath and the dimensionality of the interactions
change. Additionally, we are able to screen the quantum impurity from the bath
by finely tuning the wavelength of the light that produces the optical tweezer,
providing us with a new effective tool to control and minimize the
interactions. Our results open a range of new possibilities in quantum
simulations of quantum impurity models, quantum information, and quantum
thermodynamics, where the interactions between a quantized system and the bath
is a powerful yet largely underutilized resource.

<h3>Partial magnetic order in kagome spin ice</h3>

Motivated by the observation of partial magnetic order in kagome-based
magnets, we study the classical kagome Ising antiferromagnet, known as kagome
spin ice, including further-neighbor interactions at zero and finite
temperature. While the nearest-neighbor model displays an extensive
ground-state degeneracy, various symmetry-breaking states can appear upon
including additional couplings. Among these, peculiar partially ordered states
have been proposed. We present results from large-scale Monte-Carlo
simulations, establishing that such partial order is stabilized by
third-neighbor couplings along the hexagon diagonals. We show that these states
arise due to the emergence of one-dimensional chains in a fully frustrated
environment. We discuss their finite-temperature properties in detail and
highlight the magnetic states' peculiarities depending on the diagonal
couplings' sign, as well as suggestions to observe these states using
thermodynamic probes.

<h3>Van der Waals Spin-Orbit Torque Antiferromagnetic Memory</h3>

<br>
<br>
The technique of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal spin-orbit torque (SOT)
offers significant potential for enhancing the efficiency of magnetic memories.
However, it faces fundamental physical limitations, including hunting effects
from the metallic layer, broken symmetry for enabling antidamping switching,
spin scattering caused by interfacial defects, and sensitivity to stray
magnetic fields. To address these issues, we here propose a van der Waals (vdW)
field-free SOT antiferromagnetic memory using a vdW bilayer LaBr$_2$ (an
antiferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy) and a monolayer T$_d$
phase WTe$_2$ (a Weyl semimetal with broken inversion symmetry). By
systematically employing density functional theory in conjunction with
non-equilibrium Green's function methods and macrospin simulations, we
demonstrate that the proposed vdW SOT devices exhibit remarkably low critical
current density approximately 10 MA/cm$^2$ and rapid field-free magnetization
switching in 250 ps. This facilitates excellent write performance with
extremely low energy consumption. Furthermore, the device shows a significantly
low read error rate, as evidenced by a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio of
up to 4250%. The superior write and read performance originates from the unique
strong on-site (insulating phase) and off-site (magnetic phase) Coulomb
interactions in electride LaBr$_2$, a large non-zero z-component polarization
in WTe$_2$, and the proximity effect between them.

The field of 2D magnetic materials has paved the way for the development of
spintronics and nanodevices with new functionalities. Utilizing
antiferromagnetic materials, in addition to layered van der Waals (vdW)
ferromagnetic materials, has garnered significant interest. In this work, we
present a theoretical investigation of the behavior of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ devices
based on the non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our results show that the
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics can be influenced significantly by
controlling the length of the device and bias voltage and thus allow us to
manipulate the tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) with an external bias
voltage. This can be further influenced by the presence of the boron nitride
layer which shows significantly enhanced TMR by selectively suppressing
specific spin channels for different magnetic configurations. By exploiting
this mechanism, the observed TMR value reaches up to 3690\%, which can be
attributed to the spin-polarized transmission channel and the projected local
density of states. Our findings on the influence of structural and magnetic
configurations on the spin-polarized transport properties and TMR ratios give
the potential implementation of antiferromagnetic vdW layered materials in
ultrathin spintronics.

<br>
In this work, we explore the potential of thermodynamics as a tool for
identifying the topological phase transition. Specifically, we focus on a
one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain sandwiched between two
fermionic baths. To investigate distinctive thermodynamic signatures associated
with the topological phase, we employ heat flow analysis. Our results, derived
using a global master equation, unveil a significant suppression of heat flow
as we transition from the trivial to the topological phase. This decline in
heat flow can be attributed to the reduction in transmission coefficients of
non-zero energy modes within the topological phase. It may serve as an
indicator of a phase transition. Furthermore, we investigate the heat flow
asymmetry to search for phase transition indicators. Interestingly, no
asymmetry is observed when employing fermionic baths. However, upon
substituting fermionic baths with bosonic ones, we report a non-zero heat flow
asymmetry. For the SSH model with a few fermionic sites, this asymmetry is more
pronounced in the topological phase compared to the trivial phase. Therefore,
the observed behavior of the heat diode provides an additional means of
distinguishing between the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we delve
into the contributions from both bulk and edge effects in heat flow and
rectification to explore the impact of small system sizes on our findings.

<br>
<br>
Two-component Marangoni contracted droplets can be arranged into arbitrary
two-dimensional tiling patterns where they display rich dynamics due to vapor
mediated long-range interactions. Recent work has characterized the centered
hexagonal honeycomb lattice, showing it to be a highly frustrated system with
many metastable states and relaxation occurring over multiple timescales
[Molina et al., PNAS, 2021, 18, 34]. Here, we study this system under the
influence of a rotating gravitational field. High amplitudes are able to
completely disrupt droplet-droplet interactions, making it possible to identify
a transition between field-dominated to interaction-dominated regimes. The
system displays complex hysteresis behavior, the details of which are connected
to the emergence of linear mesoscale structures. These mesoscale features
display an elasticity that is governed by the balance between gravity and
long-ranged vapor-mediated attractions. We find that disorder plays an
important role in determining the dynamics of these features. Finally, we
demonstrate the ability to anneal the system by progressively reducing the
field amplitude, a process that reduces configurational energy compared to a
rapid quench. The ability to manipulate vapor-mediated interactions in
deliberately designed droplet tilings provides a novel platform for table-top
explorations of multi-body interactions.

We investigate a simple network, which has a branching-merging structure,
using the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process, considering conflicts at
the merging point. For both periodic and open boundary conditions, the system
exhibits metastability. Specifically, for open boundary conditions, we observe
two types of metastability: hysteresis and a nonergodic phase. We analytically
determine the tipping points, that is, the critical conditions under which a
small disturbance can lead to the collapse of metastability. Our findings
provide novel insights into metastability induced by branching-merging
structures, which exist in all network systems in various fields.

<br>

While machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials (IPs) are able to achieve
accuracies nearing the level of noise inherent in the first-principles data to
which they are trained, it remains to be shown if their increased complexities
are strictly necessary for constructing high-quality IPs. In this work, we
introduce a new MLIP framework which blends the simplicity of spline-based MEAM
(s-MEAM) potentials with the flexibility of a neural network (NN) architecture.
The proposed framework, which we call the spline-based neural network potential
(s-NNP), is a simplified version of the traditional NNP that can be used to
describe complex datasets in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate
how this framework can be used to probe the boundary between classical and ML
IPs, highlighting the benefits of key architectural changes. Furthermore, we
show that using spline filters for encoding atomic environments results in a
readily interpreted embedding layer which can be coupled with modifications to
the NN to incorporate expected physical behaviors and improve overall
interpretability. Finally, we test the flexibility of the spline filters,
observing that they can be shared across multiple chemical systems in order to
provide a convenient reference point from which to begin performing
cross-system analyses.

<br>
<br>
We develop the expressions for the non-local resistances of hybrid quantum
Hall -- superconductor devices. Our approximation depends on the crucial
assumption that the superconducting phase correlations between contacts do not
play a role. We verify the validity of our approach in two devices: in the
first one, a single superconducting contact couples to multiple edge states,
while in the second, there are multiple superconducting electrodes. The results
obtained for the second device suggest that the superconducting phase coherence
is not maintained over our micron-scale graphene devices. Possible violations
of this assumption may be used as an indication that superconducting phase
coherence is induced in quantum Hall edges.

<h3>Interplay of two $E_g$ orbitals in Superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$  Under Pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02915</a>
<br>
<i>Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
The discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC) in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO)
has aroused many interests. Previously, it was proposed that the metallization
of the $\sigma$-bonding band consisting of the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital is crucial
to realize the high-$T_c$ SC in LNO, based on which a series of theoretical
works were done in which the preformed Cooper pairs of the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital
acquire coherence via hybridization with the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital to form the
SC. However, we held a different viewpoint that the interlayer s-wave SC in LNO
is induced by the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, driven by the strong interlayer
superexchange interaction. To treat the two $E_g$ orbitals on equal footing, we
establish a two-orbital bilayer t-J model. Our calculations reveal that due to
the no-double-occupancy constraint, the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the $3d_{z^2}$
bonding band are flattened by a factor of about 2 and 10 respectively, which is
well consistent with recent ARPES measurements. The flattening of the
$3d_{z^2}$ band strongly suppresses the coherence in this orbital and hence its
$T_c$. Consequently, the $3d_{z^2}$-orbital can hardly induce SC with
$T_c\approx 80$ K, which however can be easily achieved by the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbital under realistic interaction strength. The chemical doping effect is
further investigated. With electron doping, the $\sigma$-bonding band gradually
dives below the Fermi level, but the $T_c$ continues to enhance, suggesting
that the metallization of the bonding band is not necessary for the high-$T_c$
SC in LNO. With hole doping, the $T_c$ initially drops and then rises, with the
critical doping separating between the BEC and BCS types of superconducting
transitions.Finally, there exists an intriguing pseudo gap phase above the
$T_c$, caused by the preformed pairs of the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, which merges
into the supercondcting phase after another critical doping.

<br>
<br>
We study the viscoelastic properties of highly entangled, flexible,
self-propelled polymers using Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results show
that the active motion of the polymer increases the height of the stress
plateau by orders of magnitude due to the emergence of grip forces at
entanglement points. Identifying the activity-induced energy of a single
polymer and the ratio of polymer length to self-propulsion velocity as relevant
energy and time scales, we find the stress autocorrelation functions collapse
across P\'eclet numbers. We predict that the long-time viscosity scales with
polymer length squared $\sim L^2$, in contrast to equilibrium counterparts
$\sim L^3$. These insights offer prospects for designing new materials with
activity-responsive mechanical properties.

We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction based on an interacting quantum
dot coupled to n superconducting BCS leads. Using an Anderson type model of a
local level with an arbitrary onsite Coulomb repulsion, we uncover its
surprising equivalence with an effective two-terminal junction with symmetric
couplings to appropriately phase-biased leads. Regardless of the strength of
the Coulomb interaction, this hidden symmetry enables us to apply
well-established numerical and theoretical tools for exact evaluation of
various physical quantities, and imposes strict relations among them. Focusing
on three-terminal devices, we then demonstrate several phenomena such as the
existence of the finite energy band crossings, superconducting transistor and
superconducting diode effect, as well as current phase relation modulation.
Brief analysis of four-terminal devices is also given.

<br>
We investigate the electronic structure and the optical absoprtion onset of
hexagonal boron nitride twisted bilayers at twist angles in the vicinity of
30\degree. Our investigations are done with ab initio density functional
theories and a purposely designed tight-binding model. Despite its few
parameters, we verify that the model ensures high precision on low-energy
excitations. We demonstrate that approaching 30\degree, all stacking sequences
tend to have the same band structure which is characterised by a bundle of flat
bands laying slightly above the bottom conduction. The simulated
independent-particle absorption spectra display an intense and well-defined
peak at the onset, stemming solely from transitions to the bundle of flat
states. These results suggest the presence of strong, stable and
stacking-independent optical properties of boron nitride 30\degree-twisted
bilayers. More importantly, the formation of flat bands and the
indistinguishability of the stacking sequence, are expected to be common
characteristics to all homobilayers made hexagonal monolayers at twist angles
close to 30\degree. In fact, they are a consequence of the loss of translation
symmetry (quasicrystal limit) occurring in all these systems at twists of
exactly 30\degree.

We report magnetization and neutron diffraction studies on crystal and
magnetic structures of Ir- and Rh-substituted honeycomb lattice
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The iridium or rhodium atoms are distributed at the Ru site
with little structural modification. Both systems undergo a room-temperature
monoclinic $C2/m$ to low-temperature trigonal $R\bar{3}$ phase transformation
with a large recoverable hysteresis. At low temperature, a zigzag spin order is
observed with the same characteristic wavevector $(0,0.5,1)$ as in the parent
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Detailed magnetic structure refinement reveals an ordered
moment of $\rm 0.32(5) \mu_B/Ru$ and a upper boundary of canting angle of
$15(4)^\circ$ away from the basal plane at 5~K for the 10\% Ir-substituted
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, which is different from the 0.45-0.73~$\rm \mu_B/Ru$ and
$32^\circ$-$48^\circ$ canting angle reported in the parent compound
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The observation of unchanged RuCl$_6$ local octahedral
environment, reduced magnetic moment size and canting angle highlights the
potential to study quantum spin liquid behavior through non-magnetic ion

We investigate anomalous electrical transport properties of a Ni-TiO2 hybrid
system displaying a unique nanostructured morphology. The system undergoes an
insulator to metal transition below 150 K with a low temperature metallic phase
that shows negative resistance in a four-probe configuration. Temperature
dependent transport measurements and numerical modelling show that the
anomalies originate from the dendritic architecture of the TiO2 backbone
interspersed with Ni nanoparticles that paradoxically renders this
polycrystalline, heterogeneous system highly anisotropic. The study critiques
inferences that may be drawn from four-probe transport measurements and offers
valuable insights into modelling conductivity of anisotropic hybrid materials.

<br>
<br>
Using heterogeneous-elasticity theory (HET) and a generalisation of HET
theory (GHET), obtained by applying a newly developed procedure for obtaining
the continuum limit of the glass's Hessian, we investigate the nature of
vibrational excitations, which are present in small systems, which do not allow
for low-frequency phonons. We identify two types of such non-phononic
excitations. In marginally stable systems, which can be prepared by quenching
from a rather high parental temperature, the low-frequency regime is dominated
by random-matrix vibrational wavefunctions (type-I) which in macroscopic
samples gives rise to the boson peak. They show a density of states (DOS),
which scales as $g(\omega)\sim \omega^2$. In more stable systems (reached by a
somewhat lower parental temperature) a gap appears in the type-I spectrum. This
gap is filled with other type-II non-phononic excitations, which are not
described by the previous version of HET, and have a DOS, which scales as
$g(\omega)\sim\omega^s$ with $3<s<5$. Using GHET we demonstrate that the
type-II excitations are due to local non-irrotational oscillations associated
with the stress field. The frequency scaling exponent $s$ turns out to be
non-universal, depending on the details of the interaction potential.
Specifically, we demonstrate that $s$ depends on the statistics of the small
values of the local frozen-in stresses, which are, in turn, governed by the
shape of the pair potential close to values where the potential or its first
derivative vanishes. All these findings are verified by extensive numerical
simulations of small soft-sphere glasses. Further, using level-distance
statistics, we demonstrate that both types of non-phononic excitations obey the
Gaussian-Orthogonal-Ensemble random-matrix statistics, which means that they
are extended and not localized.

The single-particle behavior in $d\geq 1$-dimensional Fermi gases with a
large number $N$ of species and strong short-range $s$-wave scattering is
discussed in the $2d$ 'tomographic' framework of a (pseudo)holographic
correspondence with a certain $3d$ gravity of the $AdS_3$ type. However, due to
the intrinsically topological nature of such a bulk theory its dynamics reduces
to a purely boundary one and so, akin to its $SYK/AdS_2$ counterpart, this
formal correspondence neither represents a genuine case of, nor endorses the
hypothetical generalized holographic duality.

<br>
<br>
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ has been established as a prototype of magnetic Weyl
semimetal, exhibiting a ''giant'' anomalous Hall effect in its ferromagnetic
phase. An attractive feature of this material is that Weyl points lie close to
Fermi level, so that one can expect a high reactivity of the topological
properties to hole or electron doping. We present here a direct observation
with Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy of the evolution of the
electronic structure under different types of substitutions : In for Sn (hole
doping outside the kagome Co plane), Fe for Co (hole doping inside the kagome
Co plane) and Ni for Co (electron doping inside the kagome Co plane). We
observe clear shifts of selected bands, which are due both to doping and to the
reduction of the magnetic splitting by doping. We discriminate between the two
by studying the temperature evolution from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state.
We discuss these shifts with the help of DFT calculations using the Virtual
Crystal Approximation. We find that these calculations reproduce rather well
the evolution with In, but largely fail to capture the effect of Fe and Ni,
where local behavior at the impurity site plays an important role.
