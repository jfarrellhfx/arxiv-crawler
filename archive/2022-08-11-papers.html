<h3>Resolving entropy contributions in nonequilibrium transitions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05295v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05295v1</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Sorkin, Joshua Ricouvier, Haim Diamant, Gil Ariel</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive a functional for the entropy contributed by any microscopic degrees
of freedom as arising from their measurable pair-correlations. Applicable both
in and out of equilibrium, this functional yields the maximum entropy which a
system can have given a certain correlation function. When applied to different
correlations, the method allows to identify the degrees of freedom governing a
certain physical regime, thus capturing and characterizing dynamic transitions.
The formalism applies also to systems whose translational invariance is broken
by external forces and whose number of particles may vary. We use it to uncover
new phenomena in two systems out of equilibrium. (i) For simulations of
self-propelled particles following the Vicsek model, the method pin-points the
flocking transition and distinguishes between position- and direction-dominated
regimes. Resolving the different entropy contributions provides an intuitive
explanation for the order-disorder transition in this system. (ii) For
experiments on jammed bidisperse emulsions, we capture a crossover from
crystalline to disordered hyperuniform structures as a function of mixture
composition. We find that the cross-correlations between the positions and
sizes droplets in the emulsion play a central role in the formation of the
disordered hyperuniform states. We discuss implications of the approach for
entropy estimation out of equilibrium and for characterizing transitions in
disordered systems and active matter.

<h3>On correlations and fluctuations of time-averaged densities and currents with general time-dependence</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05460v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05460v1</a>
<br>
<i>Cai Dieball, Alja Godec</i>
<br>
<br>
We present technical results required for the description and understanding
of correlations and fluctuations of the empirical density and current as well
as diverse time-integrated and time-averaged thermodynamic currents of
diffusion processes with a general time dependence on all time scales. In
particular, we generalize the results from arXiv:2105.10483 (Phys. Rev. Lett.,
article in press), arXiv:2204.06553 (Phys. Rev. Research, article in press),
and arXiv:2206.04034 to additive functionals with explicit time dependence and
transient or non-ergodic overdamped diffusion. As an illustration we apply the
results to two-dimensional harmonically confined overdamped diffusion in a
rotational flow evolving from a non-stationary initial distribution.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05451v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05451v1</a>
<br>
<i>David Roberts, Aashish Clerk</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an exact solution in arbitrary dimensions for the steady states of
a class of quantum driven-dissipative bosonic models, where a set of modes is
subject to arbitrary two-photon driving, single-photon loss and a global
Hubbard (or Kerr)-like interaction. Our solutions reveal a wealth of striking
phenomena, including the emergence of dissipative phase transitions, nontrivial
mode competition physics and symmetry breaking, and the stabilization of
many-body $SU(1,1)$ pair coherent states. Our exact solutions enable the
description of spatial correlations, and are fully valid in regimes where
traditional mean-field and semiclassical approaches break down.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05441v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05441v1</a>
<br>
<i>A. Metelmann</i>
<br>
<br>
Parametric couplings in engineered quantum systems are a powerful tool to
control, manipulate and enhance interactions in a variety of platforms. It
allows us to bring systems of different energy scales into communication with
each other. This short chapter introduces the basic principles and discusses a
few examples of how one can engineer parametric amplifiers with improved
characteristics over conventional setups. Clearly, the selected examples are
author-biased, and other interesting proposals and implementations can be found
in the literature. The focus of this chapter is on parametric effects between
linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, however, parametric modulation is also
applicable with nonlinear couplings and anharmonic systems.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05431v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05431v1</a>
<br>
<i>C. Branchina, V. Branchina, F. Contino</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a radically new proposal for the solution of the
naturalness/hierarchy problem, where the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass finds
its physical explanation and the well-known multiplicative renormalization of
the usual perturbative approach emerges as an IR property of the
non-perturbative running of the mass.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05417v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05417v1</a>
<br>
<i>L. F. Cugliandolo, M. Mueller</i>
<br>
<br>
We review the research on quantum glasses, with a focus on their equilibrium
dynamics and the interplay between glassiness and localization phenomena.
Interesting relations with the SYK model are discussed.

</body><h3>Enhancement of Spin-Charge Conversion Efficiency for Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$ across Transition from Paramagnetic to Ferromagnetic Phase</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05394v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05394v1</a>
<br>
<i>Takeshi Seki, Yong-Chang Lau, Junya Ikeda, Kohei Fujiwara, Akihiro Ozawa, Satoshi Iihama, Kentaro Nomura, Atsushi Tsukazaki</i>
<br>
<br>
Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$ (CSS) is one of the shandite compounds and becomes a
magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate below the ferromagnetic phase transition
temperature ($\textit{T}_\textrm{C}$). In this paper, we investigate the
temperature ($\textit{T}$) dependence of conversion between charge current and
spin current for the CSS thin film by measuring the spin-torque ferromagnetic
resonance (ST-FMR) for the trilayer consisting of CSS / Cu / CoFeB. Above
$\textit{T}_\textrm{C}$ ~ 170 K, the CSS / Cu / CoFeB trilayer exhibits the
clear ST-FMR signal coming from the spin Hall effect in the paramagnetic CSS
and the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of CoFeB. Below
$\textit{T}_\textrm{C}$, on the other hand, it is found that the ST-FMR signal
involves the dc voltages ($\textit{V}_\textrm{dc}$) not only through the AMR
but also through the giant magnetoresistance (GMR). Thus, the resistance
changes coming from both AMR and GMR should be taken into account to correctly
understand the characteristic field angular dependence of
$\textit{V}_\textrm{dc}$. The spin Hall torque generated from the ferromagnetic
CSS, which possesses the same symmetry as that for spin Hall effect, dominantly
acts on the magnetization of CoFeB. A definite increase in the spin-charge
conversion efficiency ($\xi$) is observed at $\textit{T}$ <
$\textit{T}_\textrm{C}$, indicating that the phase transition to the
ferromagnetic CSS promotes the highly efficient spin-charge conversion. In
addition, our theoretical calculation shows the increase in spin Hall
conductivity with the emergence of magnetic moment at $\textit{T}$ <
$\textit{T}_\textrm{C}$, which is consistent with the experimental observation.

</body><h3>Bulk Bogoliubov Fermi arcs in non-Hermitian superconducting systems</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05372v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05372v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jorge Cayao, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a non-Hermitian superconducting system by coupling a conventional
superconductor to a ferromagnet lead and demonstrate the emergence of
exceptional points when an external Zeeman field is applied. We discover that,
depending on the non-Hermiticity and Zeeman field, the exceptional points mark
the ends of lines with zero real energy, thus giving rise to topologically
protected and highly tunable bulk Fermi arcs, which we coin bulk Bogoliubov
Fermi arcs due their superconducting nature. We show that these bulk Bogoliubov
Fermi arcs are the non-Hermitian counterparts of the Hermitian topological
phase transition but much more prevalent and also experimentally detectable
through large spectral signatures.

</body><h3>Spin and valley effects on the quantum phase transition in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05356v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05356v1</a>
<br>
<i>A. A. Shashkin, S. V. Kravchenko</i>
<br>
<br>
Using several independent methods, we find that the metal-insulator
transition occurs in the strongly-interacting two-valley two-dimensional
electron system in ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells in zero
magnetic field. The transition survives in this system in parallel magnetic
fields strong enough to completely polarize the electrons' spins, thus making
the electron system "spinless". In both cases, the resistivity on the metallic
side near the transition increases with decreasing temperature, reaches a
maximum at a temperature $T_{\text{max}}$, and then decreases. The decrease
reaches more than an order of magnitude in zero magnetic field. The value of
$T_{\text{max}}$ in zero magnetic field is found to be close to the
renormalized Fermi temperature. However, rather than increasing along with the
Fermi temperature, the value $T_{\text{max}}$ decreases appreciably for
spinless electrons in spin-polarizing magnetic fields. The observed behavior of
$T_{\text{max}}$ cannot be described by existing theories. The results indicate
the spin-related origin of the effect. At the same time, the low-temperature
resistivity drop in both spin-unpolarized and spinless electron systems is
described quantitatively by the dynamical mean-field theory.

</body><h3>Impact of random alloy fluctuations on the electronic and optical properties of (Al,Ga)N quantum wells: Insights from tight-binding calculations</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05337v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05337v1</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Finn, Stefan Schulz</i>
<br>
<br>
Light emitters based on the semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride
((Al,Ga)N) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their
potential for a wide range of applications in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral
window. However, current state-of-the-art (Al,Ga)N light emitters exhibit very
low internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs). Therefore, understanding the
fundamental electronic and optical properties of (Al,Ga)N-based quantum wells
is key to improving the IQE. Here, we target the electronic and optical
properties of c-plane Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N/AlN quantum wells by means of an
empirical atomistic tight-binding model. Special attention is paid to the
impact of random alloy fluctuations on the results as well as the aluminium
content x in the well. We find that across the studied Al content range (from
10% to 75% Al) strong hole wave function localization effects are observed.
Additionally, with increasing Al content, electron wave functions start also to
exhibit carrier localization features. Overall, our investigations on the
electronic structure of c-plane Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N/AlN quantum wells reveal that
already random alloy fluctuations are sufficient to lead to (strong) carrier
localization effects. Furthermore, our results indicate that random alloy
fluctuations impact the degree of optical polarization in c-plane
Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N quantum wells. We find that the switching from transverse
electric to transverse magnetic light polarization occurs at higher Al contents
in the atomistic calculation, which accounts for random alloy fluctuations,
when compared to the outcome of widely used virtual crystal approximations.
This observation is important for light extraction efficiencies in
(Al,Ga)N-based light emitting diodes operating in the deep UV.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05275v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05275v1</a>
<br>
<i>Nils Kolja Wessling, Saptarsi Ghosh, Benoit Guilhabert, Menno Kappers, Rachel A. Oliver, Martin D. Dawson, Michael J. Strain</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the back-end integration of broadband, high-NA GaN
micro-lenses by micro-assembly onto non-native semiconductor substrates. We
developed a highly parallel micro-fabrication process flow to suspend micron
scale plano-convex lens platelets from 6" Si growth wafers and show their
subsequent transfer-printing integration. A growth process targeted at
producing unbowed epitaxial wafers was combined with optimisation of the
etching volume in order to produce flat devices for printing. Lens structures
were fabricated with 6 to 11 $\mu$m diameter, 2 $\mu$m height and
root-mean-squared surface roughness below 2 nm. The lenses were printed in a
vertically coupled geometry on a single crystalline diamond substrate and with
$\mu$m-precise placement on a horizontally coupled photonic integrated circuit
waveguide facet. Optical performance analysis shows that these lenses could be
used to couple to diamond nitrogen vacancy centres at micron scale depths and
demonstrates their potential for visible to infrared light-coupling
applications.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05262v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05262v1</a>
<br>
<i>D. nieek, Jarosaw Wrbel, M. Kojdecki, C. liwa, S. Schreyeck, K. Brunner, L. W. Molenkamp, G. Karczewski, Jerzy Wrbel</i>
<br>
<br>
Measurements of magnetotransport in SnTe/PbTe heterojunctions grown by the
MBE technique on (001) undoped CdTe substrates were performed. At low magnetic
fields, quantum corrections to conductivity were observed that may be
attributed to the presence of topological states at the junction interface. For
a sample with 5 nm thick SnTe layer, the data analysis suggests that midgap
states are actually gapped. However, the phase coherence effects in 10 nm and
20 nm SnTe/PbTe samples are fully explained assuming existence of gapless Dirac
cones. Magnetotransport at higher magnetic fields is described in the framework
of mobility spectrum analysis (MSA). We demonstrate that the electron- and
hole-like peaks observed simultaneously for all SnTe/PbTe heterojunctions may
originate from the concave and convex parts of the energy isosurface for
topological states -- and not from the existence of quasiparticles both
carrying negative and positive charges. This interpretation is supported by
numerical calculations of conductivity tensor components for gapless (100)
Dirac cones, performed within a classical model and based on the solutions of
Boltzmann transport equation. Our approach shows the feasibility of MSA in
application to magnetotransport measurements on topological matter.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05260v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05260v1</a>
<br>
<i>Xi Liu, Senmao Tan, Qing-hai Wang, Longwen Zhou, Jiangbin Gong</i>
<br>
<br>
This work provides a convenient and powerful means towards the engineering of
Floquet bands via Bloch oscillations, by adding a tilted linear potential to
periodically driven lattice systems. The added linear field not only restricts
the spreading of a time-evolving wavepacket but also, depending on the ratio
between the Bloch oscillation frequency and the modulation frequency of the
periodic driving, dramatically modifies the band profile and topology.
Specifically, we consider a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model as a working
example, in the presence of a linear field. Almost flat Floquet bands or
Floquet bands with large Chern numbers due to the interplay between the
periodic driving and Bloch oscillations can be obtained, with the band
structure and topology extensively tunable by adjusting the ratio of two
competing frequencies. To confirm our finding, we further execute the Thouless
pumping of one and two interacting bosons in such a lattice system and
establish its connection with the topological properties of single- and
two-particle Floquet bands.
