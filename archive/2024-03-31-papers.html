<h3>Time-correlation functions of stochastic three-sphere micromachines</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19972" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19972</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jun Li, Ziluo Zhang, Zhanglin Hou, Kento Yasuda, Linli He, Shigeyuki Komura</i>
<p>We discuss and compare the statistical properties of two stochastic
three-sphere micromachines, i.e., odd micromachine and thermal micromachine. We
calculate the steady state time-correlation functions for these micromachines
and decompose them into the symmetric and antisymmetric parts. In both cases,
the cross-correlation between the two spring extensions has an antisymmetric
part, which is a direct consequence of the broken time-reversal symmetry. For
the odd micromachine, the antisymmetric part of the correlation function is
proportional to the odd elasticity, whereas it is proportional to the
temperature difference between the two edge spheres for the thermal
micromachine. The entropy production rate and the Green-Kubo relations for the
two micromachines are also obtained. Comparing the results of the two models,
we argue an effective odd elastic constant of the thermal micromachine. The
effective odd elasticity of the thermal micromachine is proportional to the
temperature difference among the spheres, which causes an internal heat flow
and leads to directional locomotion in the presence of hydrodynamic
interactions.

<h3>Cavity electrodynamics of van der Waals heterostructures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19745</a>

<p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many-body quantum phenomena that
can be tuned in situ using electrostatic gates. These gates are often
microstructured graphite flakes that naturally form plasmonic cavities,
confining light in discrete standing waves of current density due to their
finite size. Their resonances typically lie in the GHz - THz range,
corresponding to the same $\mu$eV - meV energy scale characteristic of many
quantum effects in the materials they electrically control. This raises the
possibility that built-in cavity modes could be relevant for shaping the
low-energy physics of vdW heterostructures. However, capturing this
light-matter interaction remains elusive as devices are significantly smaller
than the diffraction limit at these wavelengths, hindering far-field
spectroscopic tools. Here, we report on the sub-wavelength cavity
electrodynamics of graphene embedded in a vdW heterostructure plasmonic
microcavity. Using on-chip THz spectroscopy, we observed spectral weight
transfer and an avoided crossing between the graphite cavity and graphene
plasmon modes as the graphene carrier density was tuned, revealing their
ultrastrong coupling. Our findings show that intrinsic cavity modes of metallic
gates can sense and manipulate the low-energy electrodynamics of vdW
heterostructures. This opens a pathway for deeper understanding of emergent
phases in these materials and new functionality through cavity control.

<h3>Corner modes in Non-Hermitian long-range model</h3>

</p><i>Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Arijit Saha, Tanay Nag</i>
<p>We consider non-Hermitian (NH) analog of a second-order topological
insulator, protected by chiral symmetry, in the presence of second-nearest
neighbor hopping elements to theoretically investigate the interplay between
long-range and topological order away from Hermiticity. In addition to the four
zero-energy corner modes present in the first nearest neighbor hopping model,
we uncover that the second nearest neighbor hopping introduces another
topological phase with sixteen zero-energy corner modes. Importantly, the NH
effects are manifested in altering the Hermitian phase boundaries for both the
models. While comparing the complex energy spectrum under open boundary
conditions, and bi-orthogonalized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) in real
space, we resolve the apparent anomaly in the bulk boundary correspondence of
the NH system as compared to the Hermitian counterpart by incorporating the
effect of non-Bloch form of momentum into the mass term. The above invariant is
also capable of capturing the phase boundaries between the two different
topological phases where the degeneracy of the corner modes is evident, as
exclusively observed for the second nearest neighbor model.

<h3>Visualizing orbital angular momentum induced single wavefront  dislocation in graphene</h3>

<p>Phase singularities are phase-indeterminate points where wave amplitudes are
zero, which manifest as phase vertices or wavefront dislocations. In the realm
of optical and electron beams, the phase singularity has been extensively
explored, demonstrating a profound connection to orbital angular momentum.
Direct local imaging of the impact of orbital angular momentum on phase
singularities at the nanoscale, however, remains a challenge and has yet to be
achieved. Here, we study the role of orbital angular momentum in phase
singularities in graphene, particularly at the atomic level, through scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experiments demonstrate that the
scatterings between different orbital angular momentum states, which are
induced by local rotational symmetry-breaking potentials, can generate
additional phase singularity, and result in robust single wavefront dislocation
in real space. Our results pave the way for exploring the effects of orbital
degree of freedom on quantum phases in quasiparticle interference processes.

<h3>Synthetic Oil Gels With Organoclays In The Formulation Of  Magnetorheological Fluids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19774</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jose Henrique Rodrigues da Rocha, Julio Gabriel de Falco Manuel, Antonio Jose Faria Bombard</i>
<p>Magnetorheological fluids (MRF) are smart composite materials that, under an
external magnetic field, show a reversible solid-liquid transition in less than
10 ms. This study aimed to evaluate which organoclays would jellify a synthetic
oil for the formulation of MRF. Three dispersant additives for carbonyl iron
powder were evaluated. Fifteen different gelling additives from four clay
families, bentonites, hectorites, montmorillonites, and mixed mineral
thixotropes (MMT), were dispersed in oil only, keeping the same concentration,
without iron particles. The gels were then tested through amplitude and
frequency sweeps in oscillatory rheometry to evaluate their viscoelastic
behavior. All the MRFs were prepared using carbonyl iron powder HS in oil gels
with the same organoclay. All three dispersant additives showed a thixotropic
recovery above 100% in the three-interval test. Regarding the dispersibility
after one year, the MRF formulations with octan-1-amine and lecithin were
reproved, as they reached normal force peaks of 19 and 24 N, while the work was
28 and 415 mJ, respectively. The best MRF was formulated with octan-1-ol, and
resulted in a normal force of 0.33 N and 3.4 mJ at 35 mm of vane penetration.
Therefore, we conclude that the MRF with octan-1-ol and montmorillonite #6
showed a better balance between thixotropy, MR effect, and, above all, good
redispersibility.

<h3>Rabi flop-assisted electron tunneling through the quantum dots</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19775" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19775</a>
<br>
</p><i>Serhii Shafraniuk</i>
<p>When the external electromagnetic field (EF) with the frequency $\omega $
acts on the discrete levels in the quantum dot (QD), it induces the mixed
quantum state characterized by Rabi flops (RF). The RF process involves the
oscillations in the level population $\delta n_{\alpha \beta }\left( t\right) $
accompanied by the cyclical absorption and re-emission of photons. The RF time
dynamics depend on the Rabi frequency $\omega _{\mathrm{R}}$ and detuning
$\Delta =\omega - \omega_Q $, where $\omega_Q =\left( \varepsilon _{\beta }-
\varepsilon _{\beta }\right) /\hbar$, $\varepsilon _{\alpha} $ and $\varepsilon
_{\beta} $ are the level energies. By using the Floquet formalism to solve the
time-dependent wave equations for the voltage-biased QD exposed to EF, we
examine how RF is expressed in the electric current. We find that the Rabi
flop-assisted tunneling (RFAT) is pronounced in the I-V curves as steps and
flat plateaus, whose position and spacing reflect the intrinsic features of the
mixed quantum state and directly depend on $\omega _{\mathrm{R}}$ and $\Delta
$. Thus, measuring RFAT allows an immediate observation of RF right in the I-V
curves, thus improving the versatility and accuracy of many applications in the
broad frequency range.

<h3>2-Morita Equivalent Condensable Algebras in Topological Orders</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19779" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19779</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rongge Xu, Holiverse Yang</i>
<p>We classify $E_2$ condensable algebras in a modular tensor category
$\mathcal{C}$ up to 2-Morita equivalent. From physical perspective, it is
equivalent to say we give the criterion when different $E_2$ condensable
algebras result in a same condensed topological phase in a 2d anyon
condensation process. By taking left and right centers of $E_1$ condensable
algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, we can exhaust all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$
condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper gives a complete interplay
between $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$
condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, and lagrangian algebras in
$\mathcal{C}\boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$.
The relations between different condensable algebras can be translated to
their module categories, which corresponds to the domain walls in topological
orders. We introduce a two-step condensation process and study the fusion of
domain walls. We also find an automorphism of an $E_2$ condensable algebra may
lead to a non-trivial braided autoequivalence in the condensed phase. As
concrete examples, we interpret the categories of quantum doubles of finite
groups. We develop a lattice model depiction of $E_1$ condensable algebras, in
which the role played by the left and right centers can be realized on a
lattice model. Examples beyond group symmetries are also been discussed.
The classification of condensable algebras and domain walls motive us to
introduce some promising concepts such as categorical quantum entanglement.
Moreover, our results can be generalized to Witt equivalent modular tensor
categories.

<h3>AlloyBERT: Alloy Property Prediction with Large Language Models</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19783" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19783</a>
<br>
</p><i>Akshat Chaudhari, Chakradhar Guntuboina, Hongshuo Huang, Amir Barati Farimani</i>
<p>The pursuit of novel alloys tailored to specific requirements poses
significant challenges for researchers in the field. This underscores the
importance of developing predictive techniques for essential physical
properties of alloys based on their chemical composition and processing
parameters. This study introduces AlloyBERT, a transformer encoder-based model
designed to predict properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength of
alloys using textual inputs. Leveraging the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder model
as its foundation, AlloyBERT employs self-attention mechanisms to establish
meaningful relationships between words, enabling it to interpret human-readable
input and predict target alloy properties. By combining a tokenizer trained on
our textual data and a RoBERTa encoder pre-trained and fine-tuned for this
specific task, we achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.00015 on the Multi
Principal Elemental Alloys (MPEA) data set and 0.00611 on the Refractory Alloy
Yield Strength (RAYS) dataset. This surpasses the performance of shallow
models, which achieved a best-case MSE of 0.00025 and 0.0076 on the MPEA and
RAYS datasets respectively. Our results highlight the potential of language
models in material science and establish a foundational framework for
text-based prediction of alloy properties that does not rely on complex
underlying representations, calculations, or simulations.

<h3>Spinon Kondo lattice in quantum spin liquids</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Xia-Ming Zheng, Mehdi Kargarian</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experimental observations of Kondo resonances in cobalt
atoms on single layer 1T-TaSe$_{2}$, we theoretically investigate the effect of
coupling a U(1) quantum spin liquid with a spinon Fermi surface to a lattice of
Anderson impurities. Within the slave-rotor formalism, we find that above a
critical coupling strength between the spin liquid and impurity lattice, the
spinons hybridize to form heavy quasiparticles near the Fermi level, realizing
a {\it spinon Kondo lattice phase} analogous to heavy fermion materials. Using
the Bethe-Salpeter equation and accounting for emergent gauge fluctuations, we
compute the spectral density and density of states, revealing the formation of
spinon-chargon bound states in the spinon Kondo lattice phase. We characterize
the thermodynamic and spectroscopic signatures of this phase, demonstrating
specific heat and neutron scattering responses distinct from a pure quantum
spin liquid. Our findings establish the spinon Kondo lattice as a framework to
study the rich physics of spin liquids.

<h3>Half century of Efros-Shklovskii Coulomb gap. Romance with Coulomb  interaction and disorder</h3>

</p><i>B. I. Shklovskii</i>
<p>Efros-Shklovskii (ES) Coulomb gap in density of localized states and ES law
of the variable range hopping conductivity were coined 50 years ago. The theory
and its first confirmations were reviewed in our monograph 40-years ago. This
paper reviews the subsequent experimental evidence, theoretical advancements,
and novel applications. Out of hundreds of experimental validations of the ES
law in a diverse range of materials, I focus on those where the dynamic range
of conductivity exceeds four orders of magnitude. These include three- and
two-dimensional semiconductors under both zero and high magnetic fields,
localized phases in the quantum Hall effect, granular metals, nanocrystal
arrays, and conducting polymers. Additionally, this review discusses the
Coulomb gap near insulator-metal transition and in non-ohmic ES law. Recent
developments of other concepts of the ES book are also discussed.

<h3>Formation of Oriented Bilayer Motif -- Vanadyl Phthalocyanine on Ag(100)</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19821" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19821</a>
<br>
</p><i>William Koll, Corina Urdaniz, Kyungju Noh, Yujeong Bae, Christoph Wolf, Jay Gupta</i>
<p>The adsorption and self-assembly of vanadyl phthalocyanine molecules on
Ag(100) has been investigated using a combination of scanning tunneling
microscopy and density functional theory. At sub-monolayer coverage, we observe
two distinct adsorption configurations of isolated molecules, corresponding to
the central O atom pointing toward (O-down) or away (O-up) from the substrate.
Upon adsorption in the O-up orientation, the otherwise achiral molecules take
on a windmill-like chiral appearance due to their interaction with the
substrate. At monolayer coverage, we observe a self-assembled square lattice
with a mixture of O-up and O-down molecules. At higher coverage we find a
strong preference for bilayer formation with O-up and O-down molecules in
alternating layers, suggesting stabilization by dipolar interactions. Close
inspection of the multi-layer surface reveals grain boundaries separating
domains of opposite organizational chirality, and long-range ordering.

<h3>Dynamical typicality in elementary cellular automata</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Nicolas Nessi</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of elementary cellular automata (CA) using numerical
simulations. We follow the dynamics of macroscopic observables, which depend on
the state of a large number of sites. If we consider the ensemble of states
that share the same value of some macroscopic observable, for example, the
density, we find that the dynamics of such macroscopic observable is
approximately the same for the vast majority of the states in the ensemble,
irrespective of the microscopic details, provided that the system size $N$ is
large enough. Moreover, we find that the dynamics of any other macroscopic
observable is also very similar for members of the same ensemble. We show that
the ensemble fluctuations around the average macro-trajectory vanish as
$N^{-1/2}$, irrespective of the observable and the dynamical rule. We show that
the same phenomenon is present if we define our initial condition ensemble by
fixing more than one macroscopic observable. The ensuing ``dynamical
typicality'' phenomenon is very similar to what was recently found in the
context of the dynamics of isolated quantum systems. Our results suggest that
the same feature is likely to be found in a wide variety of complex dynamical
systems. We also discuss the implications of our findings regarding the ability
of CA to simulate physical systems.

<h3>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological  Chalcogenides</h3>

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile
class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g.,
nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum
matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their
applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and
uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin
TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting
materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity
into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of
Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers,
metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to
exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl
semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality
two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the
long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that
occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with
inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication
techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to
designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class
of correlated 2D materials.

<h3>Ion-Mediated Structural Discontinuities in Phospholipid Vesicles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19922</a>
<br>
</p><i>Judith U. De Mel, Sudipta Gupta, Gerald J. Schneider</i>
<p>Despite intense research, methods for controlling soft matter's spontaneous
self-assembly in-to well-defined layers remain a significant challenge. We
observed ion-induced structural disconti-nuities of phospholipid vesicles that
can be exploited for controlled self-assembly of soft materials. We used
dynamic light scattering, zeta-potential measurement, cryo-electron microscopy,
small-angle X-ray, and small-angle neutron scattering. All the experimental
observations indicate that de-clining solvent quality and increasing osmotic
pressure direct lipids to expel preferentially to the inner compartment. Upon
reaching a critical concentration, excess lipids can form a new bilayer. This
spontaneous self-assembly process causes simultaneous shrinkage of the aqueous
core and expansion of the vesicle. This approach opens an intriguing path for
controlling the self-assembly of bioinspired colloids, which can also serve as
a vehicle to control the polymerization of multilayer polymeric systems.

<h3>Spin cones in random-field XY models</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19939</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rajiv G Pereira, Ananya Janardhanan, Mustansir Barma</i>
<p>We determine the arrangement of spins in the ground state of the XY model
with quenched, random fields, on a fully connected graph. Two types of
disordered fields are considered, namely randomly oriented magnetic fields, and
randomly oriented crystal fields. Orientations are chosen from a uniformly
isotropic distribution, but disorder fluctuations in each realization of a
finite system lead to a breaking of rotational symmetry. The result is an
interesting pattern of spin orientations, found by solving a system of coupled,
nonlinear equations within perturbation theory and also by exact numerical
continuation. All spins lie within a cone for small enough ratio of field to
coupling strength, with an interesting distribution of spin orientations, with
peaks at the cone edges. The orientation of the cone depends strongly on the
realization of disorder, but the opening angle does not. In the case of random
magnetic fields, the cone angle widens as the ratio increases till a critical
value at which there is a first order phase transition and the cone disappears.
With random crystal fields, there is no phase transition and the cone angle
approaches $180^\circ$ for large values of the ratio. At finite low
temperatures, Monte-Carlo simulations show that the formation of a cone and its
subsequent alignment along the equilibrium direction occur on two different
time scales.

<p>A high density CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ bulk sample was successfully synthesized using
a spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The density of the synthesized sample
was 5.02 g cm$^{-3}$, corresponding to 96.2% of the theoretical density of
CaKFe$_4$As$_4$. Moreover, a reasonably high Vickers hardness of 1 GPa was
measured. The electrical resistivity of the SPS bulk sample was as low as
approximately 600 $\mu\Omega$ cm at 300 K, which is smaller than that of the
ordinary sintered polycrystalline sample by nearly one order of magnitude, and
exhibited a sharp superconducting transition, with the transition width
$\Delta\textit{T}_c$ less than 2 K, indicating an improved grain connectivity.
The critical current density of the SPS bulk sample, as calculated from the
magnetization hysteresis loops (magnetic $\textit{J}_c$), reached 18 kA
cm$^{-2}$ at 4.2 K under 5 T, which is the highest among the iron-based
superconductor polycrystalline samples reported thus far.

<p>Grain alignment is a key factor that determines the performance of a
superconducting bulk. In this study, the spark plasma texturing (SPT) technique
was used to fabricate a CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ superconducting bulk. X-ray diffraction
and electron backscatter diffraction revealed that the $c$-axes of the
CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ grains in the SPT bulk are aligned, demonstrating that the SPT
technique is effective in achieving $c$-axis texture. In addition, chemical
composition analysis showed that oxide impurities, which affect the grain
boundary characteristics that determine the inter-grain critical current
density ($J_c$), are randomly distributed in the SPT bulk. Magnetization
measurements showed high $J_c$ values of the SPT bulk, reaching 127 kA
cm$^{-2}$ and 26 kA cm$^{-2}$ at 4.2 K under a self-field and magnetic field of
5 T, respectively. These results suggest that the SPT technique is a promising
approach for obtaining a high-performance superconducting bulk material for
high-field applications.

<h3>High temperature spin selectivity in a quantum dot qubit using reservoir  spin accumulation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>R. Jansen, S. Yuasa</i>
<p>Employing spins in quantum dots for fault-tolerant quantum computing in
large-scale qubit arrays with on-chip control electronics requires
high-fidelity qubit operation at elevated temperature. This poses a challenge
for single spin initialization and readout. Existing schemes rely on Zeeman
splitting or Pauli spin blockade with typical energy scales of 0.1 or 1 meV for
electron-based qubits, so that sufficient fidelity is obtained only at
temperatures around or below 0.1 or 1 K, respectively. Here we describe a
method to achieve high temperature spin selectivity in a quantum dot using a
reservoir with a spin accumulation, which deterministically sets the spin of a
single electron on the dot. Since spin accumulation as large as 10 meV is
achievable in silicon, spin selection with electrically adjustable error rates
below $10^{-4}$ is possible even in a liquid He bath at 4 K. Via the reservoir
spin accumulation, induced and controlled by a nearby ferromagnet, classical
information (magnetization direction) is mapped onto a spin qubit. These
features provide the prospect of spin qubit operation at elevated temperatures
and connect the worlds of quantum computing and spintronics.

</p><i>Jaehee Lee, Jeongun Lee, Seounghee Yun, Sanha Kim, Shawn A. Chester, Hansohl Cho</i>
<p>Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and
fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been
of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments
and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal,
size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent
fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum
model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic
length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred
from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical
approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent
fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers
that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented,
which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in
elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.

</p><i>Mikiya Tomikawa, Ryo Araki, Atsutoshi Ikeda, Ai Nakamura, Dai Aoki, Kenji Ishida, Shingo Yonezawa</i>
<p>Piezomagnetism, linear response between strain and magnetic field, is
relatively unexplored cross-correlation but has promising potential as a novel
probe of time-reversal-symmetry breaking in various classes of materials.
Interestingly, there has been no report of piezomagnetism in ferromagnets, most
archetypal time-reversal-symmetry-broken materials. This half-century absence
of piezomagnetic ferromagnets is attributable to complications originating from
multiple-domain states, as well as from changes in the magnetic point group by
rotation of magnetic moment. Here, we report characteristic V-shaped
magnetostriction in the Ising itinerant ferromagnet URhGe, observed by
simultaneous multi-axis strain measurement technique utilizing optical fiber
Bragg grating sensors. This novel magnetostriction occurs only under fields
along the c axis and does not scale with the square of magnetization. Such
unconventional feature indicates piezomagnetism as its origin. Our observation,
marking the first report of piezomagnetism in ferromagnets, is owing to the
mono-domain switching and the Ising magnetization. The obtained piezomagnetic
coefficients are fairly large, implying that Ising ferromagnets are promising
frontiers when seeking for materials with large piezomagnetic responses.

<h3>Local magnetic moment formation and Kondo screening in the presence of  Hund exchange: the two-band Hubbard model analysis</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20036" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20036</a>
<br>
</p><i>T. B. Mazitov, A. A. Katanin</i>
<p>We study formation and screening of local magnetic moments in the two-band
Hubbard model in the presence of Hund exchange interaction using dynamic mean
field theory approach. The characteristic temperatures of the formation,
beginning and full screening of local magnetic moments are obtained from the
analysis of temperature dependencies of the orbital, charge, and spin
susceptibilities, as well as the respective instantaneous correlation
functions. At half filling we find the phase diagram, which is similar to the
single-orbital case with wide region of formation of local magnetic moments
below the orbital Kondo temperature. Similarly to the single-orbital case, with
decreasing temperature the screening of local magnetic moments is preceded by
appearance of fermionic quasiparticles. In the two-band case the quasiparticles
are however present also in some temperature region above the Mott insulating
phase. At finite doping we find broad regime of presence of local magnetic
moments, which coexist with incoherently or coherently moving holes. We also
find, similarly to the half filled case, finite temperature interval in the
doped regime, when the fermionic quasiparticles are formed, but do not yet
screen local magnetic moments.

<h3>Tuning Fermi Liquids with Sub-wavelength Cavities</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20067" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20067</a>
<br>
</p><i>Riccardo Riolo, Andrea Tomadin, Giacomo Mazza, Reza Asgari, Allan H. MacDonald, Marco Polini</i>
<p>The question of whether or not passive sub-wavelength cavities can alter the
properties of quantum materials is currently attracting a great deal of
attention. In this Letter we show that the Fermi liquid parameters of a
two-dimensional metal are modified by cavity polariton modes, and that these
changes can be monitored by measuring a paradigmatic magneto-transport
phenomenon, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in a weak perpendicular magnetic
field. This effect is intrinsic, and totally unrelated to disorder. As an
illustrative example, we carry out explicit calculations of the Fermi liquid
parameters of graphene in a planar van der Waals cavity formed by natural
hyperbolic crystals and metal gates.

<h3>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a  dissipative cavity</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath</i>
<p>In this Letter, we report the onset of periodic oscillations of coherences in
an interacting bosonic gas coupled to a resonator after a quantum quench. This
dynamics extends the collapse and revival features of atomic correlations in
optical lattices to a dissipative scenario and exhibits hallmarks of
synchronization. The behavior emerges from the interplay of the quantum
dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate)
strong symmetry in the dissipative system, providing a general recipe to
engineer intriguing quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the
approximate symmetry can arise dynamically during self-organization and can be
employed to obtain long-lived coherences.

<h3>From cell intercalation to flow, the importance of T1 transitions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Harish P. Jain, Axel Voigt, Luiza Angheluta</i>
<p>Within the context of epithelial monolayers, T1 transitions, also known as
cell-intercalations, are topological rearrangements of cells that contribute to
fluidity of the epithelial monolayers. We use a multi-phase field model to show
that the ensemble-averaged flow profile of a T1 transition exhibits a saddle
point structure, where large velocities are localised near cells undergoing T1
transitions, contributing to vortical flow. This tissue fluidisation
corresponds to the dispersion of cells relative to each other. While the
temporal evolution of the mean pair-separation distance between initially
neighbouring cells depends on specific model details, the mean pair-separation
distance increases linearly with the number of T1 transitions, in a way that is
robust to model parameters.

<h3>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron  systems: Floquet engineering perspective</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20110" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20110</a>
<br>
</p><i>Miho Tanaka, Masahiro Sato</i>
<p>We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced
magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems
irradiated by a circularly polarized light. Quantum master (GKSL) equation
enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable
dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of
laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we investigate (i) the
nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave (CW) and (ii)
ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the
laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser
frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are
shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for
dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on
ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the
Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a
precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous
magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by
changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin
dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the
pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results provides
a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems
irradiated by intense light.

<h3>Static versus dynamically polarizable environments within the many-body  $\bf{GW}$ formalism</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20114" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20114</a>
<br>
</p><i>David Amblard, Xavier Blase, Ivan Duchemin</i>
<p>Continuum or discrete polarizable models for the study of optoelectronic
processes in embedded subsystems rely mostly on the restriction of the
surrounding electronic dielectric response to its low frequency limit. Such a
description hinges on the assumption that the electrons in the surrounding
medium react instantaneously to any excitation in the central subsystem,
treating thus the environment in the adiabatic limit. Exploiting a recently
developed embedded $GW$ formalism, with an environment described at the fully
ab initio level, we assess the merits of the adiabatic limit with respect to an
environment where the full dynamics of the dielectric response is considered.
Further, we show how to properly take the static limit of the environment
susceptibility, introducing the so-called Coulomb-hole and screened-exchange
contributions to the reaction field. As a first application, we consider a
C$_{60}$ molecule at the surface of a C$_{60}$ crystal, namely a case where the
dynamics of the embedded and embedding subsystems are similar. The common
adiabatic assumption, when properly treated, generates errors below $10\%$ on
the polarization energy associated with frontier energy levels and associated
energy gaps. Finally, we consider a water molecule inside a metallic nanotube,
the worst case for the environment adiabatic limit. The error on the gap
polarization energy remains below $10\%$, even though the error on the frontier
orbitals polarization energies can reach a few tenths of an electronvolt.

<h3>High entropy metallic glasses, what does it mean?</h3>

</p><i>G.V. Afonin, J.C. Qiao, A.S. Makarov, R.A. Konchakov, E.V. Goncharova, N.P. Kobelev, V.A.Khonik</i>
<p>We performed calorimetric measurements on 30 bulk metallic glasses differing
with their mixing entropies DSmix. On this basis, the excess entropies DS and
excess enthalpies DH of glasses with respect to their maternal crystalline
states are calculated. It is found that the excess entropy DS on the average
decreases with increasing mixing entropy DSmix. This means that so-called
"high-entropymetallic glasses" (i.e. the glasses having high DSmix) actually
constitute glasses with low excess entropy DS. We predict that such glasses
should have reduced relaxation ability. We also found that the excess enthalpy
DH of glass linearly increases with its excess entropy DS, in line with a
general thermodynamic estimate.

<p>Efficient heat management at cryogenic temperatures is crucial for
superconducting quantum technologies. In this study, we demonstrate the heat
diode performance of a gap asymmetric superconducting tunnel junction. Our
results show that the mechanism of bipolar thermoelectricity, which occurs when
the hot side has the larger gap, boosts heat rectification. This improvement is
consistent for a broad range of thermal biases and for different values of the
superconducting gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that bipolar
thermoelectricity can act as a heat pipe, reducing heat losses towards cold
terminals and increasing overall efficiency up to $65\%$. Finally, we show that
by adjusting the electrical load, it is possible to tune the heat pipe and
diode performances.

<h3>Vortex glass transition and thermal creep in niobium films</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20121" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20121</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sameh M. Altanany, I. Zajcewa, T. Zajarniuk, A. Szewczyk, Marta Z. Cieplak</i>
<p>The evolution of the vortex glass (VG) phase transition and vortex creep with
decreasing film thickness is studied in ultrathin, polycrystalline niobium
films, with thickness in the range 7.4 nm to 44 nm, using current-voltage
characteristics measurements in perpendicular magnetic field. Standard methods,
including scaling laws, allow to identify VG transition in the thickest film,
while in thinner films creep produces large uncertainty in the putative VG
transition temperature and scaling exponents. Using strong pinning theory we
perform analysis of the creep, and extract the dependence of the activation
energy for vortex pinning on temperature, magnetic field, and film thickness.
This analysis provides more information on vortex dynamics than the standard
evaluation of critical current density. The results reveal two distinct regimes
of pinning, which we propose to identify with $\delta l$ or $\delta T_c$-types
of pinning (due to spacial fluctuation of mean free path $l$ or spacial
fluctuation of superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, respectively). In
the thickest film $\delta l$ pinning is observed, but with the decrease of film
thickness the second pinning regime appears, and becomes dominant in the
thinnest film. We link these pinning regimes with the structural disorder due
to grain boundaries, which produce charge carrier scattering in the thickest
film, but with decreasing film thickness gradually evolve into amorphous
inclusions, producing fluctuations in the $T_c$.

<p>The presence of quantum vortices determines the electromagnetic response of
superconducting materials and devices. Controlling the vortex motion, their
pinning on intrinsic and artificial defects is therefore essential for
superconducting electronics. Here we take advantage of the attractive force
between a magnetic cantilever of the Magnetic Force Microscope and a single
quantum vortex to spatially map the pinning force inside 50-240 nm thick
magnetron-sputtered Nb-films, commonly used in advanced superconducting
electronics. The revealed pinning nano-network is related to the
thickness-dependent granular structure of the films as well as to the
characteristic microscopic scales of superconductivity. Our approach is
general, and can be directly applied to other type II granular superconducting
materials and nanodevices.

<h3>Na Vacancy Driven Phase Transformation and Fast Ion Conduction in  W-doped Na$_3$SbS$_4$ from Machine Learning Force Fields</h3>

</p><i>Johan Klarbring, Aron Walsh</i>
<p>Solid-state sodium batteries require effective electrolytes that conduct at
room temperature. The Na$_3$SbS$_4$ (Pn = P, Sb; Ch = S, Se) family have been
studied for their high Na ion conductivity. The population of Na vacancies,
which mediate ion diffusion in these materials, can be enhanced through
aliovalent doping on the pnictogen site. To probe the microscopic role of
extrinsic doping, and its impact on diffusion and phase stability, we trained a
machine learning force field for Na$_{3-x}$W$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x}$S$_4$ based on an
equivariant graph neural network. Analysis of large-scale molecular dynamics
trajectories shows that an increased Na vacancy population stabilises the
global cubic phase at lower temperatures with enhanced Na ion diffusion, and
that the explicit role of the substitutional W dopants is limited. In the
global cubic phase we observe large and long-lived deviations of atoms from the
averaged symmetry, echoing recent experimental suggestions. Evidence of
correlated Na ion diffusion is also presented that underpins the suggested
superionic nature of these materials.

<br>
</p><i>Marie-Christin Heißenbüttel, Pierre-Maurice Piel, Julian Klein, Thorsten Deilmann, Ursula Wurstbauer, Michael Rohlfing</i>
<p>The optical properties of the layered magnet CrSBr are dominated by
intralayer excitons: the antiferromagnetic order between the layers makes
layer-to-layer charge hopping, and therefore interlayer excitons,
spin-forbidden. An external magnetic field, however, continuously drives the
magnetic order towards layer-to-layer ferromagnetic, which opens spin-allowed
charge-transfer channels between the layers. Here we elaborate how their
admixture changes the composition and nature of the excitons, leading to an
extension over many layers, and causes a quadratic red-shift with respect to
the external magnetic field. We address these effects by ab-initio $GW$-BSE
calculations as a function of magnetic field and cast the data into a minimal
four-band model to elucidate the interplay between the various interaction and
coupling mechanisms. Our findings should be generally valid for
antiferromagnetic layered magnets with and without external magnetic fields,
and moreover for any couple of layers with different spin directions. Our
insights help to systematically address excitons and predict their optical
signatures in such systems.

to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid. Magnetic fields are a convenient
parameter for tuning between different phases of the Kitaev systems, and have
even been investigated for potentially counteracting the effects of other
destabilizing interactions leading to a revival of the topological phase. Here
we review the progress in understanding the effects of magnetic fields on some
of the perturbed Kitaev systems, particularly on fractionalization and
topological order.

</p><i>Jun Hu, Zhan-Long Wang</i>
<p>This study investigated crystallization and self-assembly phenomena in
polyacrylamide (PAM) solutions during evaporation. As the solvent gradually
evaporated, microscopic crystals began to form in the solution. The results
show that concentration gradients form as the solution evaporates, leading to
varied crystalline morphologies. From the edge to the center of the PAM
solution, grass-like structures with intricate vein-like patterns and irregular
morphologies were formed. The concentration gradient played a crucial role in
this process. The relationship between the concentration gradient and
crystalline structures was elucidated using absorbance spectroscopy. Schematics
and absorbance spectra illustrate the evolution of the crystallization stages.
Our findings not only contribute to a fundamental understanding of colloidal
self-assembly but also hold significant implications for various applications,
including thin-film fabrication, drug delivery, and nanotechnology.

<p>Thermodynamically stable low-temperature phases of the Bose-Fermi mixtures
composed of bosons and spinless fermions close to four dimensions are
considered. In the regime, where the only boson-fermion two-body interaction is
present and tuned to unitary limit, the properties of a system solely depend on
the mass and number ratios of constituent atoms. In addition to the phase with
the dimers (boson-fermion shallow bound states), we identified one more state
of the mixture with the coexistence of fermionic dimers and trimers. The
universal physics of these phases, the characteristic feature of is absence of
the Bose-Einstein condensate, is discussed.

<h3>Electric field enhancement of the superconducting spin-valve effect via  strain-transfer across a ferromagnetic/ferroelectric interface</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tomohiro Kikuta, Sachio Komori, Keiichiro Imura, Tomoyasu Taniyama</i>
<p>In a ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) superconducting
spin-valve (SSV), a change of the magnetization alignment of the two F layers
modulates the critical temperature (Tc) of the S layer. The Tc-switching (the
SSV effect) is based on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.
Fast and large resistive switching associated with the Tc-switching is suitable
for nonvolatile cryogenic memory applications. However, external magnetic
field-based operation of SSVs is hindering their miniaturization, and
therefore, electric field control of the SSV effect is desired. Here, we report
epitaxial growth of a La0.67Ca0.33MnO3/YBa2Cu3O7/La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 SSV on a
piezo-electric [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3]0.7-[PbTiO3]0.3 (001) substrate and
demonstrate electric field control of the SSV effect. Electric field-induced
strain-transfer from the piezo-electric substrate increases the magnetization
and Tc of the SSV, and leads to an enhancement of the magnitude of
Tc-switching. The results are promising for the development of
magnetic-field-free superconducting spintronic devices, in which the S/F
interaction is not only sensitive to the magnetization alignment but also to an
applied electric field.

<p>We explore the structure and magnetic field response of edge dislocations in
Grandjean-Cano wedge cells filled with chiral mixtures of the ferroelectric
nematic mesogen DIO. Upon cooling, the ordering changes from paraelectric in
the cholesteric phase N* to antiferroelectric in the smectic SmZ_A* and to
ferroelectric in the cholesteric N_F*. Dislocations of the Burgers vector b
equal the helicoidal pitch P are stable in all three phases, while dislocations
with b=P/2 exist only in the N* and SmZ_A*. The b=P/2 dislocations split into
pairs of {\tau}(-1/2) {\lambda}(+1/2) disclinations, while the thick
dislocations b=P are pairs of nonsingular {\lambda}(-1/2) {\lambda}(+1/2)
disclinations. The polar order makes the {\tau}(-1/2) disclinations unstable in
the N_F* phase, as they should be connected to singular walls in the
polarization field. We propose a model of transformation of the composite
{\tau}(-1/2) line-wall defect into a nonsingular {\lambda}(-1/2) disclination,
which is paired up with a {\lambda}(+1/2) line to form a b=P dislocation. The
SmZ_A* behavior in the in-plane magnetic field is different from that of the
N_F* and N*: the dislocations show no zigzag instability, and the pitch remains
unchanged in the magnetic fields up to 1 T. The behavior is associated with the
finite compressibility of smectic layers.

<p>We propose a field-free switching mechanism that utilizes two spatially

one of the currents is subsequently switched off. The superposition of these
two currents results in an in-plane magnetization, which is not orthogonal to
the remaining SOT current after the second one is deactivated. This
symmetry-breaking procedure leads to reproducible and rapid switching, with
field pulse durations as short as 0.25 nanoseconds.

<br>
</p><i>Christian R. Ast, Piotr Kot, Maneesha Ismail, Sebastián de-la-Peña, Antonio I. Fernández-Domínguez, Juan Carlos Cuevas</i>
<p>Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) has enabled probing the electronic structure of single magnetic atoms and
molecules on surfaces with unprecedented energy resolution, as well as
demonstrating coherent manipulation of single spins. Despite this remarkable
success, the field could still be greatly advanced by a more quantitative
understanding of the ESR-STM physical mechanisms. Here, we present a theory of
ESR-STM which quantitatively models not only the ESR signal itself, but also
the full background tunneling current, from which the ESR signal is derived.
Our theory is based on a combination of Green's function techniques to describe
the electron tunneling and a quantum master equation for the dynamics of the
spin system along with microwave radiation interacting with both the tunneling
current and the spin system. We show that this theory is able to quantitatively
reproduce the experimental results for a spin-1/2 system (TiH molecules on MgO)
across many orders of magnitude in tunneling current, providing access to the
relaxation and decoherence rates that govern the spin dynamics due to intrinsic
mechanisms and to the applied bias voltage. More importantly, our work
establishes that: (i) sizable ESR signals, which are a measure of
microwave-induced changes in the junction magnetoresistance, require
surprisingly high tip spin polarizations, (ii) the coupling of the
magnetization dynamics to the microwave field gives rise to the asymmetric ESR
spectra often observed in this spectroscopy. Additionally, our theory provides
very specific predictions for the dependence of the relaxation and decoherence
times on the bias voltage and the tip-sample distance. Finally, with the help
of electromagnetic simulations, we find that the transitions in our ESR-STM
experiments can be driven by the ac magnetic field at the junction.

<p>Transport probes the motion of quasiparticles in response to external
excitations. Apart from the well-known electric and thermoelectric transport,
acoustoelectric transport induced by traveling acoustic waves has been rarely
explored. Here, by adopting a hybrid nanodevices integrated with piezoelectric
substrates, we establish a simple design of acoustoelectric transport with gate
tunability. We fabricate dual-gated acoustoelectric devices based on
BN-encapsuled graphene on LiNbO3. Longitudinal and transverse acoustoelectric
voltages are generated by launching pulsed surface acoustic wave. The gate
dependence of zero-field longitudinal acoustoelectric signal presents
strikingly similar profiles as that of Hall resistivity, providing a valid
approach for extracting carrier density without magnetic field. In magnetic
fields, acoustoelectric quantum oscillations appear due to Landau quantization,
which are more robust and pronounced than Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Our
work demonstrates a feasible acoustoelectric setup with gate tunability, which
can be extended to the broad scope of various Van der Waals materials.

</p><i>Aleksejus Kononovicius, Bronislovas Kaulakys</i>
<p>Previously we have shown that pure 1/f noise arises from the
trapping-detrapping process when traps are heterogeneous. Namely, the
trapping-detrapping process relies on the assumption that detrapping rates of
individual trapping centers in the condensed matter are random and uniformly
distributed. Another assumption underlying the trapping-detrapping process was
that both trapping and detrapping times need to have non-zero duration. Here we
violate the latter assumption by introducing immediate recapture of the charge
carrier. We show that 1/f noise will still be observed, though the range of
frequencies over which it will be observed shifts to the lower frequency range
as the immediate recapture probability increases.

<p>A structural orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition was recently
discovered in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ at a pressure

044702 (2023); Huston \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Mat. \textbf{6}, 114801
(2022)]. In the high-pressure tetragonal phase, a phase transition at
$T_x=235$~K and a superconducting transition at $T_{sc}=2$~K have been
revealed. In this work, we present an electrical-resistivity study of UTe$_2$
in pulsed magnetic fields up to $\mu_0H=58$~T combined with pressures up to $p$
= 6 GPa. The field was applied in a direction tilted by 30~$^\circ$~from
\textbf{b} to \textbf{c} in the orthogonal structure, which is identified as
the direction \textbf{c} of the tetragonal structure. In the tetragonal phase,
the presence of superconductivity is confirmed and signatures of metamagnetic
transitions are observed at the fields $\mu_0H_{x1}=24$~T and
$\mu_0H_{x2}=34$~T and temperatures smaller than $T_x$. We discuss the effects
of uniaxial pressure and we propose that a magnetic ordering drives the
transition at $T_x$.
