<h3>Integrability breaking from backscattering</h3>

We analyze the onset of diffusive hydrodynamics in the one-dimensional
hard-rod gas subject to stochastic backscattering. While this perturbation
breaks integrability and leads to a crossover from ballistic to diffusive
transport, it preserves infinitely many conserved quantities corresponding to
even moments of the velocity distribution of the gas. In the limit of small
noise, we derive the exact expressions for the diffusion and structure factor
matrices, and show that they are generically off-diagonal in the presence of
interactions. We find that the particle density structure factor is
non-Gaussian and singular near the origin, with a return probability showing
logarithmic deviations from diffusion.

<h3>Role of Defects and Wrinkles in Thermal Conductivity of Wafer-scale hBN  Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08683</a>

Thermal conductivity of large area hexagonal boron nitride films grown by
metal organic vapor phase epitaxy technique is reported. In this study, both
defects and wrinkles are present in 2 nm and 10 nm-thick films, while 30
nm-thick films are free from wrinkles. Raman spectroscopy, an optothermal
non-contact technique, is employed to probe the temperature and laser power
dependence property of the Raman active E2ghigh phonon mode; which in turn is
used to estimate the rise in the temperature of the films under different laser
powers. As the conventional Fourier heat diffusion law cannot be directly
employed analytically to estimate the thermal conductivity of these films with
defects and wrinkles, finite element modeling is used instead. The effective
thermal conductivity is estimated to be 87, 55, and 117 W/m.K for the 2, 10,
and 30 nm-thick films, respectively. We also present a quantitative estimation
of the thermal resistance by defects and wrinkles individually to the heat
flow. The average heat resistance in the film is used to incorporate an overall
defect structure and Voronoi cells with contact resistance at the
cell-boundaries are constructed to mimic the wrinkled domains. Our study
reveals that the defects/impurities render a much higher resistance to the heat
transfer in the films than wrinkles. The thickness of the films also plays a
crucial role in the determination of the thermal conductivity of the films.

<h3>Optical manipulation of layer-valley coherence via strong exciton-photon  coupling in microcavities</h3>

Coherent control and manipulation of quantum degrees of freedom such as spins
forms the basis of emerging quantum technologies. In this context, the robust
valley degree of freedom and the associated valley pseudospin found in
two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is a highly attractive
platform. Valley polarization and coherent superposition of valley states have
been observed in these systems even up to room temperature. Control of valley
coherence is an important building block for the implementation of valley
qubit. Large magnetic fields or high-power lasers have been used in the past to
demonstrate the control (initialization and rotation) of the valley coherent
states. Here we demonstrate control of layer-valley coherence via strong
coupling of valley excitons in bilayer WS2 to microcavity photons by exploiting
the pseudomagnetic field arising in optical cavities owing to the TE-TM
splitting. The use of photonic structures to generate pseudomagnetic fields
which can be used to manipulate exciton-polaritons presents an attractive
approach to control optical responses without the need for large magnets or
high intensity optical pump powers.

<h3>Orbital magnetic quadrupole moment in higher order topological phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08438" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08438</a>
<br>
<i>Jacopo Gliozzi, Mao Lin, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the orbital magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) in three dimensional
higher-order topological phases. Much like electric quadrupole moment, which is
associated with a charge response on the boundaries of a finite sample, the
diagonal components of the MQM manifest as surface-localized magnetization and
hinge currents. The hinge current is generally not equal to the difference of
surface magnetizations that intersect at the hinge, and we show this mismatch
is precisely quantified by the bulk MQM. We derive a quantum mechanical formula
for the layer-resolved magnetization in slab geometries and use it to define
the MQM of systems with gapped boundaries. Our formalism is then applied to
several higher-order topological phases, and we show that the MQM can
distinguish phases in some intrinsic and boundary-obstructed higher-order
topological insulators. We then show that derivatives of the MQM with respect
to the chemical potential can act as quantized topological invariants, similar
to obtaining the 2D Chern number as a derivative of the magnetization with
respect to the chemical potential. These invariants provide a new way to
characterize 3D time-reversal breaking insulators that have vanishing
magnetization.

<h3>Inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional quantum turbulence in a fluid  of light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08441" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08441</a>
<br>

Turbulence in quantum fluids has, surprisingly, a lot in common with its
classical counterparts, including cascade of excitations across length scales.
In two dimensions, the existence of a range of length scales (the inertial
range) over which kinetic energy is transferred from small to large length
scales is known as an inverse energy cascade and has been observed in several
classical systems from soap films to Jupiter's atmosphere. For quantum fluids,
there has been a long debate about the possibility of these inverse cascades,
and while recent works suggest their existence, the microscopic mechanism is
still debated and a direct experimental observation is still missing. In this
work, we report a direct experimental signature of a flux of kinetic energy
from small to large length scales in a quantum fluid of light and the
observation of a Kolmogorov scaling law in the incompressible kinetic energy
spectrum. The microscopic origin of the algebraic exponents in the energy
spectrum is understood by studying the internal structure of quantized vortices
within the healing length and their clustering at large length scales. Finally,
we identify the statistical relationship between the inverse energy cascade and
the spatial correlations of clustered vortices. These results are obtained
using two counter-streaming fluids of light, which allows for a precise
preparation of the initial state and the in-situ measurement of the
compressible and incompressible fluid velocity. This novel platform opens
exciting possibilities for the study of non-equilibrium turbulence dynamics in
reduced dimensions with a controlled forcing mechanism and an homogeneous
density.

<h3>DyFraNet: Forecasting and Backcasting Dynamic Fracture Mechanics in  Space and Time Using a 2D-to-3D Deep Neural Network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08482" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08482</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Chuan Hsu, Markus J. Buehler</i>

<br>
The dynamics of materials failure is one of the most critical phenomena in a
range of scientific and engineering fields, from healthcare to structural
materials to transportation. In this paper we propose a specially designed deep
neural network, DyFraNet, which can predict dynamic fracture behaviors by
identifying a complete history of fracture propagation - from cracking onset,
as a crack grows through the material, modeled as a series of frames evolving
over time and dependent on each other. Furthermore, this model can not only
forecast future fracture processes but also backcast to elucidate the past
fracture history. In this scenario, once provided with the outcome of a
fracture event, the model will elucidate past events that led to this state and
will predict the future evolution of the failure process. By comparing the
predicted results with atomistic-level simulations and theory, we show that
DyFraNet can capture dynamic fracture mechanics by accurately predicting how
cracks develop over time, including measures such as the crack speed, as well
as when cracks become unstable. We use GradCAM to interpret how DyFraNet
perceives the relationship between geometric conditions and fracture dynamics
and we find DyFraNet pays special attention to the areas around crack tips,
which have a critical influence in the early stage of fracture propagation. In
later stages, the model pays increased attention to the existing or newly
formed damage distribution in the material. The proposed approach offers
significant potential to accelerate the exploration of the dynamics in material
design against fracture failures and can be beneficially adapted for all kinds
of dynamical engineering problems.

<h3>Shear-band cavitation determines the shape of the stress-strain curve of  metallic glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08492" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08492</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Metallic glasses are known to have a remarkably robust yield strength,
admitting Weibull moduli as high as for crystalline engineering alloys.
However, their post-yielding behavior is strongly varying, with large scatter
in both flow stress levels and strains at failure. Using x-ray tomography we
reveal for the first time how a strain-dependent internal evolution of
shear-band cavities underlies this unpredictable post yielding response. We
demonstrate how macroscopic strain-softening coincides with the first detection
of internal shear-band cavitation. Cavity growth during plastic flow is found
to follow a power-law, which yields a fractal dimension and a roughness
exponent in excellent agreement with self-similar surface properties obtained
after fracture. These findings demonstrate how internal micro-cracking coexists
with shear-band plasticity along the plastic part of a stress-strain curve,
rationalizing the large variability of plastic flow behavior seen for metallic
glasses.

<h3>Cell Invasion during Competitive Growth of Polycrystalline  Solidification Patterns</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08500" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08500</a>
<br>
<i>Younggil Song, Fatima L. Mota, Damien Tourret, Kaihua Ji, Bernard Billia, Rohit Trivedi, Nathalie Bergeon, Alain Karma</i>
<br>
<br>
Spatially extended cellular and dendritic array structures forming during
solidification processes such as casting, welding, or additive manufacturing
are generally polycrystalline. Both the array structure within each grain and
the larger scale grain structure determine the performance of many structural
alloys. How those two structures coevolve during solidification remains poorly
understood. By in situ observations of microgravity alloy solidification
experiments onboard the International Space Station, we have discovered that
individual cells from one grain can unexpectedly invade a nearby grain of
different misorientation, either as a solitary cell or as rows of cells. This
invasion process causes grains to interpenetrate each other and hence grain
boundaries to adopt highly convoluted shapes. Those observations are reproduced
by phase-field simulations further demonstrating that invasion occurs for a
wide range of misorientations. Those results fundamentally change the
traditional conceptualization of grains as distinct regions embedded in
three-dimensional space.

<h3>Nonlinear chiral photocurrent in parity-violating magnetic Weyl  semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08521" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08521</a>
<br>
<i>Shiva Heidari, Reza Asgari</i>
<br>
<br>
The strong correlation between the non-trivial band topology and the magnetic
texture makes magnetic Weyl semimetals excellent candidates for the
manipulation and detection of magnetization dynamics. The parity violation
together with the Pauli blocking cause only one Weyl node to contribute to the
photocurrent response, which in turn affects the magnetic texture due to the
spin transfer torque. Utilizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the
spin-transfer torque in non-centrosymmetric Weyl magnets, we show that the
chiral photocurrent rotates the magnetization from the easy c axis to the a or
b axis, which leads to an exotic current next to the photocurrent response. The
chiral photocurrent is calculated in the context of quantum kinetic theory and
it has a strong resonance on the order of mA/W near the Weyl nodes, the
magnitude of which is controlled by the momentum relaxation time. Remarkably,
we study the influence of magnetic texture dynamics on the topological
nonlinear photocurrent response, including shift and injection currents along
with the new chiral photocurrent, and show that both the magnitude and the
in-plane orientation of the chiral photocurrent are strongly correlated with
the direction of the magnetic moments.

<h3>Disentangling lattice and electronic instabilities in the excitonic  insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ by nonequilibrium spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08537" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08537</a>
<br>
<i>Kota Katsumi, Alexandr Alekhin, Sofia-Michaela Souliou, Michael Merz, Amir-Abbas Haghighirad, Matthieu Le Tacon, Sarah Houver, Maximilien Cazayous, Alain Sacuto, Yann Gallais</i>
<br>
<br>
Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is an excitonic insulator candidate showing the
semiconductor/semimetal-to-insulator (SI) transition below $T_{\text{c}}$ = 326
K. However, since a structural transition accompanies the SI transition,
deciphering the role of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in driving
the SI transition has remained controversial. Here, we investigate the
photoexcited nonequilibrium state in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ using pump-probe Raman and
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. The combined nonequilibrium
spectroscopic measurements of the lattice and electronic states reveal the
presence of a photoexcited metastable state where the insulating gap is
suppressed, but the low-temperature structural distortion is preserved. We
conclude that electron correlations play a vital role in the SI transition of
Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.

<h3>Heat conduction in herbertsmithite: field dependence at the onset of the  quantum spin liquid regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08546</a>
<br>
<i>Q. Barthélemy, É. Lefrançois, J. Baglo, P. Bourgeois-Hope, D. Chatterjee, P. Lefloïc, M. Velázquez, V. Balédent, B. Bernu, N. Doiron-Leyraud, F. Bert, P. Mendels, L. Taillefer</i>
<br>
<br>
We report thermal conductivity measurements on single crystals of
herbertsmithite, over a wide range of temperatures (0.05-120 K) in magnetic
fields up to 15 T. We also report measurements of the thermal Hall effect,
found to be vanishingly small. At high temperatures, in the paramagnetic
regime, the thermal conductivity has a negligible field dependence. Upon
cooling and the development of correlations, the onset of a clear monotonic
field dependence below about 20 K signals a new characteristic temperature
scale that may reflect the subtle crossover towards the quantum spin liquid
regime. Deconfined spinons, if present, are not detected and phonons, as the
main carriers of heat, are strongly scattered by the intrinsic spin excitations
and the magnetic defects. In view of the colossal fields required to affect the
intrinsic spins, most of the field-induced evolution is attributed to the
progressive polarization of some magnetic defects. By elaborating a
phenomenological model, we extract the magnetization of these main scattering
centers which does not resemble the Brillouin function for free spins 1/2,
requiring to go beyond the paradigm of isolated paramagnetic spins. Besides,
the onset of a nonmonotonic field dependence below about 2 K underlines the
existence of another characteristic temperature scale, previously highlighted
with other measurements, and sheds new light on the phase diagram of
herbertsmithite down to the lowest temperatures.

<h3>Tailoring on-surface molecular reactions and assembly through  hydrogen-modified synthesis: From triarylamine monomer to 2D covalent organic  framework</h3>

<br>
<br>
Relative to conventional wet-chemical synthesis techniques, on-surface
synthesis of organic networks in ultrahigh vacuum has few control parameters.
The molecular deposition rate and substrate temperature are typically the only
synthesis variables to be adjusted dynamically. Here we demonstrate that
reducing conditions in the vacuum environment can be created and controlled
without dedicated sources -- relying only on backfilled hydrogen gas and ion
gauge filaments -- and can dramatically influence the Ullmann-like on-surface
reaction used for synthesizing two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D
COFs). Using tribromo dimethylmethylene-bridged triphenylamine ((Br$_3$)DTPA)
as monomer precursors, we find that atomic hydrogen blocks aryl-aryl bond
formation. Control of the relative monomer and hydrogen fluxes is used to
produce large islands of self-assembled monomers, dimers, or macrocycle
hexamers. On-surface synthesis of these oligomers, from a single precursor,
circumvents potential challenges with protracted wet-chemical synthesis or low
precursor volatility for large molecules. Using scanning tunneling microscopy
and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we show that changes in the electronic states
through this oligomer sequence provide an insightful view of the 2D-COF
(synthesized in the absence of atomic hydrogen) as the endpoint in an evolution
of electronic structures from the monomer.

<h3>Observation of self-patterned defect formation in atomic superfluids --  from ring dark solitons to vortex dipole necklaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08575</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Unveiling non-equilibrium dynamics of solitonic and topological defect
structures in a multidimensional nonlinear medium is a current frontier across
diverse fields. One of the quintessential objects is a ring dark soliton (RDS),
whose dynamics are expected to display remarkable interplay between symmetry
and self-patterned topological defect formation from a transverse (snake)
instability but has thus far evaded full experimental observations. Here, we
report an experimental realization of RDS generation in a two-dimensional
atomic superfluid trapped in a circular box. By quenching the confining box
potential, we observe spontaneous soliton emission from the edge and its
signature radial collapse dynamics in a superfluid. As an RDS evolves, we
observe spontaneous transverse modulations at discrete azimuthal angles, which
clearly result in a patterned formation of a circular vortex dipole array.
Through collisions of the vortex dipoles with the box trap, we observe vortex
unbinding, vortex pinning to the edge, and emission of rarefaction pulses. Our
box-quench protocol opens a new way to study multidimensional dark solitons,
structured formation of topological defects, and potentially the dynamics of
ordered quantum vortex matter.

<h3>Exploring Supervised Machine Learning for Multi-Phase Identification and  Quantification from Powder X-Ray Diffraction Spectra</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08591" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08591</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Powder X-ray diffraction analysis is a critical component of materials
characterization methodologies. Discerning characteristic Bragg intensity peaks
and assigning them to known crystalline phases is the first qualitative step of
evaluating diffraction spectra. Subsequent to phase identification, Rietveld
refinement may be employed to extract the abundance of quantitative,
material-specific parameters hidden within powder data. These characterization
procedures are yet time-consuming and inhibit efficiency in materials science
workflows. The ever-increasing popularity and propulsion of data science
techniques has provided an obvious solution on the course towards materials
analysis automation. Deep learning has become a prime focus for predicting
crystallographic parameters and features from X-ray spectra. However, the
infeasibility of curating large, well-labelled experimental datasets means that
one must resort to a large number of theoretic simulations for powder data
augmentation to effectively train deep models. Herein, we are interested in
conventional supervised learning algorithms in lieu of deep learning for
multi-label crystalline phase identification and quantitative phase analysis
for a biomedical application. First, models were trained using very limited
experimental data. Further, we incorporated simulated XRD data to assess model
generalizability as well as the efficacy of simulation-based training for
predictive analysis in a real-world X-ray diffraction application.

<h3>Compatible director fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$</h3>

The geometry and interactions between the constituents of a liquid crystal,
which are responsible for inducing the partial order in the fluid, may locally
favor an attempted phase that could not be realized in $\mathbb{R}^3$. While
states that are incompatible with the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^3$ were
identified more than 50 years ago, the collection of compatible states remained
poorly understood and not well characterized. Recently, the compatibility
conditions for three-dimensional director fields were derived using the method
of moving frames. These compatibility conditions take the form of six
differential relations in five scalar fields locally characterizing the
director field. In this work, we rederive these equations using a more
transparent approach employing vector calculus. We then use these equations to
characterize a wide collection of compatible phases.

Quantum effects of lattice vibration play a major role in many physical
properties of condensed matter systems, including thermal properties such as
specific heat, structural phase transition, as well as phenomena such as
quantum crystal and quantum paraelectricity that are closely related to
zero-point fluctuations. However, realizing atomistic simulations for realistic
materials with a fully quantum-mechanical description remains a great
challenge. Here, we propose a first-principle strategy for large scale
Molecular Dynamics simulation, where high accuracy force field obtained by
Deep-Potential (DP) is combined with Quantum Thermal Bath (QTB) method to
account for quantum effects. We demonstrate the power of this DP+QTB method
using the archetypal example SrTiO$_3$, which exhibits several phenomena
induced by quantum fluctuations, such as the suppressed structure phase
transition temperature, the quantum paraelectric ground state at low
temperature and the quantum critical behavior $1/T^2$ law of dielectric
constant. Our DP+QTB strategy is efficient in simulating large scale system,
and is first principle. More importantly, quantum effects of other systems
could also be investigated as long as corresponding DP model is trained. This
strategy would greatly enrich our vision and means to study quantum behavior of
condensed matter physics.

<br>
Skyrmions and bimerons are versatile topological spin textures that can be
used as information bits for both classical and quantum computing. The
transformation between isolated skyrmions and bimerons is an essential
operation for computing architecture based on multiple different topological
bits. Here we report the creation of isolated skyrmions and their subsequent
transformation to bimerons by harnessing the electric current-induced Oersted
field and temperature-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy variation. The
transformation between skyrmions and bimerons is reversible, which is
controlled by the current amplitude and scanning direction. Both skyrmions and
bimerons can be created in the same system through the skyrmion-bimeron
transformation and magnetization switching. Deformed skyrmion bubbles and
chiral labyrinth domains are found as nontrivial intermediate transition
states. Our results may provide a unique way for building advanced
information-processing devices using different types of topological spin
textures in the same system.

The interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the
superconductor/ferromagnet (SC/FM) heterostructures generates many interesting
physical phenomena, including spin-triplet superconductivity, superconducting
order parameter oscillation, and topological superconductivity. The unique
physical properties make the SC/FM heterostructures as promising platforms for
future superconducting spintronics and quantum computation applications. In
this article, we review important research progress of SC/FM heterostructures
from superconducting spintronics to quantum computation, and it is organized as
follows. Firstly, we discuss the progress of spin current carriers in SC/FM
heterostructures including Bogoliubov quasiparticles, superconducting vortex,
and spin-triplet Cooper pairs which might be used for long-range spin
transport. Then, we will describe the {\pi} Josephson junctions and its
application for constructing {\pi} qubits. Finally, we will briefly review
experimental signatures of Majorana states in the SC/FM heterostructures and
the theoretically proposed manipulation, which could be useful to realize
fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.

<h3>On the Variability of Grain Boundary Mobility in the Isoconfigurational  Ensemble</h3>

<br>

Recent grain growth experiments have revealed that the same type of grain
boundary can have very different mobilities depending on its local
microstructure. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify
uncertainty in the reduced mobility of curved grain boundaries for different
types of boundary conditions and over a range of initial velocity seeds. We
consider cylindrical island grains in Ni with a [001] tilt axis as a model
system. Unexpectedly, we find large variation in the reduced mobility of curved
grain boundaries depending on both the imposed constraints and the initial
velocity distribution. We perform a dynamic propensity analysis inspired from
studies of glass forming liquids to analyze sources of variation in reduced
mobility. Our work highlights the significant impact of initial velocity
distributions on grain boundary motion which has not been analyzed in prior
work.

Trap-assisted nonradiative recombination is known to limit the efficiency of
optoelectronic devices, but the conventional multi-phonon emission (MPE)
process fails to explain the observed loss in wide-band-gap materials. Here we
highlight the role of trap-assisted Auger-Meitner (TAAM) recombination, and
present a first-principles methodology to determine TAAM rates due to defects
or impurities in semiconductors or insulators. We assess the impact on
efficiency of light emitters in a recombination cycle that may include both
TAAM and carrier capture via MPE. We apply the formalism to the technologically
relevant case study of a calcium impurity in InGaN, where a Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination cycle involving MPE alone cannot explain the experimentally
observed nonradiative loss. We find that, for band gaps larger than 2.5 eV, the
inclusion of TAAM results in recombination rates that are orders of magnitude
larger than recombination rates based on MPE alone, demonstrating that TAAM can
be a dominant nonradiative process in wide-band-gap materials. Our
computational formalism is general and can be applied to the calculation of
TAAM rates in any semiconducting or insulating material.

The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), typically observed in ferromagnetic (FM)
metals with broken time-reversal symmetry, depends on electronic and magnetic
properties. In Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2-x}$In$_{x}$S$_{2}$, a giant AHE has been
attributed to Berry curvature associated with the FM Weyl semimetal phase, yet
recent studies report complicated magnetism. We use neutron scattering to
determine the spin dynamics and structures as a function of $x$ and provide a
microscopic understanding of the AHE and magnetism interplay. Spin gap and
stiffness indicate a contribution from Weyl fermions consistent with the AHE.
The magnetic structure evolves from $c$-axis ferromagnetism at $x$ = 0 to a
canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure with reduced $c$-axis moment and
in-plane AFM order at $x$ = 0.12 and further reduced $c$-axis FM moment at $x$
= 0.3. Since noncollinear spins can induce non-zero Berry curvature in real
space acting as a fictitious magnetic field, our results revealed another AHE
contribution, establishing the impact of magnetism on transport.

<h3>Physical mechanisms of the Soret effect in binary Lennard-Jones liquids  elucidated with thermal-response calculations</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Soret effect is the tendency of fluid mixtures to exhibit concentration
gradients in the presence of a temperature gradient. Using molecular-dynamics
simulation of two-component Lennard-Jones liquids, it is demonstrated that
spatially-sinusoidal heat pulses generate both temperature and pressure
gradients. Over short timescales, the dominant effect is the generation of
compressional waves which dissipate over time as the system approaches
mechanical equilibrium. The approach to mechanical equilibrium is also
characterized by a decrease in particle density in the high-temperature region,
and an increase in particle density in the low-temperature region. It is
demonstrated that concentration gradients develop rapidly during the
propagation of compressional waves through the liquid. Over longer timescales,
heat conduction occurs to return the system to thermal equilibrium, with the
particle current acting to restore a more uniform particle density. It is shown
that the Soret effect arises due to the fact that the two components of the
fluid exhibit a different response to pressure gradients. First, the so-called
isotope effect occurs because light atoms tend to respond more rapidly to the
evolving conditions. In this case, there appears to be a connection to previous
observations of fast sound in binary fluids. Second, it is shown that the
partial pressures of the two components in equilibrium, and more directly the
relative magnitudes of their derivatives with respect to temperature and
density, determine which species accumulates in the high- and low-temperature
regions. In the conditions simulated here, the dependence of the partial
pressure on density gradients is larger than the the dependence on temperature
gradients.

The nodal-line semimetal is a the topological gapless phase containing
one-dimensional degeneracies called nodal lines. The nodal lines are deformed
by a contiuous change of the system such as pressure and they can even change
their topology, but it is not systematically understood what kind of changes of
topology of nodal lines are possible. In this paper, we classify the events of
topology change of nodal lines by the Morse theory, and reveal that only three
types of topology changes of nodal lines, i.e. creation, reconnection, and
annihilation, are possibe in the spinless nodal-line semimetal protected by
inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. They are characterized by an
index having the values 0, 1 and 2 for the above three types in the Morse
theory. Moreover, we extend our theory to systems with rotational symmetries
and mirror symmetry, and disclose the possible events of topology change of
nodal lines under each symmetry.

Owning to their high controllability, laser pulses have contributed greatly
to our understanding of strongly correlated electron systems. However, typical
multicycle pulses do not control the symmetry of systems that plays an
important role in the emergence of novel quantum phases. Here, we demonstrate
that subcycle pulses whose oscillation is less than one period within a pulse
envelope can control inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the electronic
states of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using an ultrashort
subcycle pulse, one can generate a steady electric current (SEC) in a
photoexcited state due to an Aharonov-Bohm flux instantaneously introduced
through the phase of an electric field. Consequently, time-reversal symmetry is
broken. In contrast, a broad subcycle pulse does not induce SEC but instead
generates electric polarization, thus breaking inversion symmetry. Both
symmetry breakings in a photoexcited state can be monitored by second harmonic
generation. These findings provide a new methodology for designing the
symmetries of electronic states and open up a new field of subcycle-pulse
engineering.

Experimental demonstration of nanometer-scale logic devices composed of
atomically sized quantum dots, combined with the availability of SiQAD, a
computer-aided design (CAD) tool designed for this technology, have sparked
research interest in future atomic-scale logic systems based on these quantum
dots. These studies range from gate designs all the way to new electronic
design automation frameworks, resulting in synthesized circuits reaching the
size of $32\times10^3\,$nm$^{2}$, which is orders of magnitude more complex
than their hand-designed counterparts. However, current simulation capabilities
offered by SiQAD do not include defect simulations, meaning that near-surface
imperfections are not taken into account when designing these large SiDB
layouts. This work introduces fixed-charge simulation into SimAnneal, the main
SiDB charge configuration simulator of SiQAD, to cover an important class of
defects that has a non-negligible effect on the behavior of nearby SiDB charge
states at non-negligible distances -- up to 10 nm and beyond. We compared the
simulation results with past experimental fittings and found the results to
match fairly accurately. For the three types of defects tested, T1 arsenic, T2
silicon vacancy, and a stray SiDB, the root mean square percentage errors
between experimental and simulated results are 3%, 17%, and 4% respectively.
The availability of this new simulation capability will provide researchers
with more tools to recreate experimental environments and perform sensitivity
analyses on logic designs.

<h3>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition in a Bose-Hubbard model with  localized gain and loss</h3>

We study the dissipative dynamics of a one dimensional bosonic system
described in terms of the bipartite Bose-Hubbard model with alternating gain
and loss.This model exhibits the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry under some specific
conditions and features a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition. It is
characterized by an order parameter, corresponding to the population imbalance
between even and odd sites, similar to the continuous phase transitions in the
Hermitian realm. In the non-interacting limit, we solve the problem exactly and
compute the parameter dependence of the order parameter. The interacting limit
is addressed at the mean-field level, which allows us to construct the phase
diagram for the model. We find that both the interaction and dissipation rates
induce a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. On the other hand, periodic
modulation of the dissipative coupling in time stabilizes the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime. Our findings are corroborated numerically on a
tight-binding chain with gain and loss.

<br>
<br>
Topological superconductivity is expected to spur Majorana zero modes --
exotic states that are also considered a quantum technology asset. Fractional
Josephson effect is their manifestation in electronic transport measurements,
often under microwave irradiation. A fraction of induced resonances, known as
Shapiro steps, should vanish, in a pattern that signifies the presence of
Majorana modes. Here we report patterns of Shapiro steps expected in
topological Josephson junctions, such as the missing first Shapiro step, or
several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum
wells with Al contacts, are studied near zero magnetic field, meaning that they
are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as
missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to
topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is
rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance
versus voltage curves, but several origins may be at play. Our results
demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify
topological superconductivity, and a multifactor approach is necessary to
unambiguously establish this important phenomenon.

<br>
<br>
Theoretical and experimental studies have supported that the electronic
structure of $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ under pressure is described by
two-dimensional Dirac fermions. When the interlayer tunneling is coherent, the
electronic structure of the system becomes three-dimensional, and we expect the
peak structure to appear in the interlayer resistivity under magnetic fields.
We theoretically and experimentally show that the peak appears in the
interlayer resistivity at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. From the
experiment, we estimate that the magnitude of the interlayer tunneling is $t_1
\sim 1$ meV. Our result opens the door to investigating the three-dimensional
electronic structure of $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$.

<br>
Carrier and phonon dynamics in a multilayer WSe2 film are captured by extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy at the W N6,7, W O2,3,
and Se M4,5 edges (30-60 eV). After the broadband optical pump pulse, the XUV
probe directly reports on occupations of optically excited holes and
phonon-induced band renormalizations. By comparing with density functional
theory calculations, XUV transient absorption due to holes are identified below
the W O3 edge whereas signals at the Se M4,5 edges are dominated by phonon
dynamics. Therein, 0.4 ps hole relaxation time, 1.5 ps carrier recombination
time, and 1.7 ps phonon heating time are extracted. The acquisition of hole and
phonon-induced signals in a single experiment can facilitate the investigation
of the correlations between electron and phonon dynamics. Furthermore, the
simultaneous observation of signals from different elements can be further
extended to explore photochemical processes in multilayers and alloys, thereby
providing key information for their applications in electronics,
photocatalysts, and spintronics.

<h3>Neglected $U(1)$ phase in the Schroedinger representation of quantum  mechanics and particle number conserving formalisms for superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08759</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroyasu Koizumi</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconductivity is reformulated as a phenomenon in which a stable velocity
field is created by a $U(1)$ phase neglected by Dirac in the Schroedinger
representation of quantum mechanics. The neglected phase gives rise to a $U(1)$
gauge field expressed as the Berry connection from many-body wave functions.
The inclusion of this gauge field transforms the standard particle-number
non-conserving formalism of superconductivity to a particle-number conserving
one with many results of the former unaltered. In other words, the new
formalism indicates that the current standard one is an approximation that
effectively takes into account this neglected $U(1)$ gauge field by employing
the particle-number non-conserving formalism. Since the standard and new
formalisms are physically different, conflicting results are predicted in some
cases. We reexamine the Josephson relation and show that a capacitance
contribution of the Josephson junction to the $U(1)$ phase is missing in the
standard formalism, and inclusion of it indicates that the standard theory
actually does one agree with the experiment while the new one does. It is also
shown that the dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions
predicted in the standard theory does not exit in the new one in accordance
with the recent experimental result.

<br>
<br>
Hysteretic switching of domain states is a salient character of all ferroic
materials and the foundation for their multifunctional applications.
Ferro-rotational order is emerging as a new type of ferroic order featuring
structural rotations, but its controlled switching remains elusive due to its
invariance under both time reversal and spatial inversion. Here, we demonstrate
electrical switching of ferro-rotational domain states in nanometer-thick
1T-TaS$_2$ crystals in its charge-density-wave phases. Cooling from the
high-symmetry phase to the ferro-rotational phase under an external electric
field induces domain state switching and domain wall formation, realized in a
simple two-terminal configuration using a volt-scale voltage. Although the
electric field does not couple with the order due to symmetry mismatch, it
drives domain wall propagation to give rise to reversible, durable, and
nonvolatile isothermal state switching at room temperature. These results pave
the path for manipulation of the ferro-rotational order and its nanoelectronic
applications.

Recently, Zhang-Rice triplet to singlet excitations have been measured
experimentally and verified numerically in a van der Waals antiferromagnet
NiPS\textsubscript{3}, which reveals a collective local change of an electronic
structure. In particular, such numerical simulations predicted that these
electronic excitations occur simultaneously with local electric polarizations.
In this study, we uncover the microscopic origin of this local electric
polarization in the Zhang-Rice triplet to singlet excitation. Our lattice-model
calculation predicts that the electric polarization can be controlled by
applied magnetic fields. We speculate emergence of local Berry curvature to
describe the electric polarization in this strongly correlated system.

The aggregate glue of spider orb web is an excellent natural adhesive.
Orb-weaver spiders use micron-scale aggregate glue droplets to retain prey in
the capture spiral silks of their orb web. In aggregate glue droplets, highly
glycosylated and phosphorylated proteins dissolve in low molecular mass
compounds. The aggregate glue droplets show a heterogeneous structural
distribution after attaching to the substrate. Although components of the
aggregate glue droplets have been well analyzed and determined in past studies,
visualization of the spatial distribution of their chemical components before
and after their attachment is the key to exploring their adhesion mechanisms.
Here, we investigated the distribution of low molecular mass compounds and
glycoproteins in aggregate glue droplets using the in situ measurement methods
and visualized the role of specific low molecular mass compounds in promoting
glycoprotein modification in the aggregate glue. The results of the analysis
suggest that the constituents of aggregate glue droplets include at least one
ionic liquid: hydrated choline dihydrogen phosphate, while the modification of
glycoproteins in aggregate glue depends on the concentration of this ionic
liquid. This natural ionic liquid does not affect the fluorescence activity of
fluorescent proteins, indicating that proteins of aggregate glue droplets can
be dissolved well and maintain the stability of their higher-order structures
in that ionic liquid. As a natural ionic liquid, aggregate glue droplets from
the spider orb webs may be an excellent ionic liquid material model.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the ground state and critical temperature phase diagrams of
the classical and quantum $S=1/2$ pyrochlore lattice with nearest-neighbor
Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI). We consider
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange as well as direct and
indirect DMI. Classically, three ground states are found: all-in/all-out,
ferromagnetic and a locally ordered $XY$ phase, known as $\Gamma_5$, which
displays an accidental classical U(1) degeneracy. Quantum zero-point energy
fluctuations are found to lift the classical ground state degeneracy and select
the $\psi_3$ state in most parts of the $\Gamma_5$ regime. Likewise, thermal
fluctuations treated classically, select the $\psi_3$ state at $T=0^+$. In
contrast, classical Monte Carlo finds that the system orders at $T_c$ in the
$\psi_2$ state of $\Gamma_5$ for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and
indirect DMI with a transition from $\psi_2$ to $\psi_3$ at a temperature
$T_{\Gamma_5} <T_c$. The same method finds that the system orders via a single
transition at $T_c$ directly into the $\psi_3$ state for most of the region
with ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and indirect DMI. Such ordering behavior
at $T_c$ for the $S=1/2$ quantum model is corroborated by high-temperature
series expansion. To investigate the $T=0$ quantum ground states, we apply the
pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group (PFFRG). The quantum
paramagnetic phase of the pure antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model is
found to persist over a finite region in the phase diagram for both direct or
indirect DMI. We find that near the boundary of ferromagnetism and $\Gamma_5$
antiferromagnetism the system may potentially realize a quantum ground state
lacking conventional magnetic order. Otherwise, for the largest portion of the
phase diagram, PFFRG finds the same ordered phases as in the classical model.

line in the supercooled regime down to the no-man's land. Extensive molecular
dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 liquid/vapor interface in the range 198

high accuracy at 283$\pm$5 K, close to the temperature of maximum density
(TMD). This temperature also coincides with the appearance of a density anomaly
at the interface known as the apophysis. We relate the emergence of the
apophysis to the observation of HDL water adsorption in the proximity of the

A statistical multi-step self-consistent (SMSSC) micromechanical model for
predicting elastic and plastic properties of a three-dimensional Representative
Volume Element (RVE) is proposed in this research. A body with randomly
distributed rough penny-shaped microcracks is considered for the first time in
which the distribution of cracks is included through different well-known
statistical distributions. Initially, the solution for a rough cohesive
penny-shaped crack is developed, and the relationship between crack nominal
length and roughness is derived. Consequently, Crack Opening Displacement (COD)
and the corresponding volume crack opening are calculated as a function of
surface roughness. Next, the SMSSC is used to study the effects of nominal
crack length distribution on a fractured medium's mechanical properties with a
known statistical distribution of crack sizes. This is done by determining the
energy release and evaluating its share in material degradation (elastic,
plastic). The elastic properties calculated using SMSSC indicated that the
fractality of crack trajectories leads to lower values of volume crack opening
and, consequently, resulted in a lower level of stiffness degradation compared
with previous smooth crack approximations. It is also reached that the
statistical distribution of rough cracks influences the mechanical properties
due to the interrelation between length and roughness. Regarding the plastic
behavior, the proposed micromechanical methodology is implemented to construct
a capped pressure-sensitive yielding potential function that explicitly
highlights the influence of crack size statistical distribution on the yielding
of cracked solids. It is evident that the statistical distribution of crack
sizes which are interrelated with crack roughness, can significantly alter the
corresponding yield surface of fractured media.

<br>
<br>
Despite recent extensive studies of the non-Hermitian topology, understanding
interaction effects is left as a crucial question. In this paper, we address
interaction effects on exceptional points which are protected by the
non-trivial point-gap topology unique to non-Hermitian systems. Our analysis in
a two-dimensional parameter space elucidates the existence of exceptional
points and symmetry-protected exceptional rings fragile against interactions;
they are topologically protected only in non-interacting cases. This fragility
of exceptional points and symmetry-protected exceptional rings arises from the
reduction of non-Hermitian topological classifications, which is elucidated by
introducing topological invariants of the second-quantized Hamiltonian for both
non-interacting and interacting cases. These topological invariants are also
available to analyze the reduction phenomena of gapped systems. The above
results strongly suggest similar reduction phenomena of exceptional points in
generic cases and open up a new direction of research in the non-Hermitian
topology.

We report on linear magnetoelectric effect observed by the static electric
polarization measurements in external magnetic field up to 12 T on topological
multidomain antiferromagnet Cu$_3$TeO$_6$. The polarization is non-zero only
below the N\'{e}el temperature and for $\mathbf{E}\perp \mathbf{H}$. The
magnetization data show spin reorientation taking place already in $H<$1 T.
This is fully captured by the anisotropic Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian,
revealing the change of the magnetic point group from $\bar{3}$' in the ground
state to $m$ in the applied magnetic field, in agreement with the observed
magnetoelectric effect. Both point groups allow the ferrotoroidic order which
could be a source of magnetoelectric effect in this system. Our results
establish Cu$_3$TeO$_6$ as a playground for the study of magnetoelectric
topological antiferromagnets and a host of several phenomena which are of

Controlling the magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic materials plays a key
role in magnetic switching devices and spintronic applications. Examples of
spin-orbit torque devices with different magnetic anisotropy geometries
(in-plane or out-of-plane directions) have been demonstrated with novel
magnetization switching mechanisms for extended device functionalities.
Normally, the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy in ferromagnetic materials is
unchanged within a fixed direction, and thus, it is difficult to realize
multifunctionality devices. Therefore, continuous modulation of magnetic
anisotropy in ferromagnetic materials is highly desired but remains
challenging. Here, we demonstrate a gate-tunable magnetic anisotropy transition
from out-of-plane to canted and finally to in-plane in layered Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$
by combining the measurements of the angle-dependent anomalous Hall effect and
magneto-optical Kerr effect with quantitative Stoner-Wohlfarth analysis. The
magnetic easy axis continuously rotates in a spin-flop pathway by gating or
temperature modulation. Such observations offer a new avenue for exploring
magnetization switching mechanisms and realizing new spintronic
functionalities.

Short-timescale atomic rearrangements are fundamental to the kinetics of
glasses and frequently dominated by one atom moving significantly (a
rearrangement), while others relax only modestly. The rates and directions of
such rearrangements (or hops) are dominated by the distributions of activation
barriers (Eact) for rearrangement for a single atom and how those distributions
vary across the atoms in the system. We have used molecular dynamics
simulations of Cu50Zr50 metallic glass below Tg in an isoconfigurational
ensemble to catalog the ensemble of rearrangements from thousands of sites. The
majority of atoms are strongly caged by their neighbors, but a tiny fraction
has a very high propensity for rearrangement, which leads to a power-law
variation in the cage-breaking probability for the atoms in the model. In
addition, atoms generally have multiple accessible rearrangement vectors, each
with its own Eact. However, atoms with lower Eact (or higher rearrangement
rates) generally explored fewer possible rearrangement vectors, as the low Eact
path is explored far more than others. We discuss how our results influence
future modeling efforts to predict the rearrangement vector of a hopping atom.

<h3>Large-Gap Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators in \textit{A}Ti\textit{X}  Class</h3>

We theoretically propose that the monolayer $A$Ti$X$ family (KTiSb, KTiBi,
RbTiSb, SrTiSn) are potential candidates for large-gap quantum anomalous Hall
insulators with high Chern number $\mathcal{C}=2$. Both of the topology and
magnetism in these materials are from $3d$-orbitals of Ti. We construct the
tight-binding model with symmetry analysis to reveal the origin of topology.
Remarkably, quite different from the conventional $s$-$d$ band inversion, here
the topological band inversion within $3d$ orbitals is due to the crystal field
and electron hopping, while spin-orbit coupling only trivially gaps out the
Dirac cone at Fermi level. The general physics from the $3d$ orbitals here
applies to a large class of transition metal compounds with the space group
$P4/nmm$ or $P$-$42m$ and their subgroups.

Magnons and plasmons are two very different types of collective modes, acting
on the spin and charge degrees of freedom, respectively. At first sight, the
formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon polaritons in heterostructures of plasmonic
and magnetic systems would face two challenges, the small mutual interaction,
via Zeeman coupling of the electromagnetic field of the plasmon with the spins,
and the energy mismatch, as in most systems plasmons have energies in the eV
range, orders of magnitude larger than magnons. Here we show that graphene
plasmons form polaritons with the magnons of two-dimensional ferrromagnetic
insulators, placed up to to half a micron apart, with Rabi couplings in the
range of 100 GHz (dramatically larger than cavity QED magnonics). This strong
coupling is facilitated both by the small energy of graphene plasmons and the
cooperative super-radiant nature of the plasmon-magnon coupling afforded by
phase matching. We show that the Rabi coupling can be modulated both
electrically and mechanically and we propose a attenuated total internal
reflection experiment to implement ferromagnetic resonance experiments on 2D
ferromagnets driven by plasmon excitation.

<h3>Survival in a nanoforest of absorbing pillars</h3>

<br>
<i>Denis S. Grebenkov, Alexei T. Skvortsov</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the survival probability and the associated distribution of
first-passage times to a periodic array of absorbing pillars confined between
two parallel reflecting planes. We approximate the periodic cell of this system
by a cylindrical tube containing a single pillar. Using a mode matching method,
we obtain an exact solution of the modified Helmholtz equation in this domain
that determines the Laplace transform of the survival probability. This
solution reveals the respective roles of several geometric parameters: the
height and radius of the pillar, the inter-pillar distance, and the distance
between confining planes. This model allows us to explore different asymptotic
regimes in the probability density of the first-passage time. In the
practically relevant case of a large distance between confining planes, we
argue that the mean first-passage time is much larger than the typical time and
thus uninformative. We also illustrate the failure of the capacitance
approximation for the principal eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. Some
practical implications and future perspectives are discussed.

<h3>Exotic liquid crystalline phases in monolayers of vertically vibrated  granular particles</h3>

<br>
<br>
Vibrated monolayers of granular particles confined into horizontal cavities
form a variety of fluid patterns with orientational order that resemble
equilibrium liquid-crystal phases. In some cases one can identify nematic and
smectic patters that can be understood in terms of classical statistical
mechanics of hard bodies. Low aspect ratio cylinders project as rectangles and
form uniaxial, or 2-atic, and tetratic, or 4-atic, nematic phases. Other
polygonal particles may exhibit different liquid-crystal phases, in general
$p$-atic phases, of higher symmetries. We give a brief summary of theoretical
work on rectangles and triangles, and provide some experimental results on
vibrated monolayers. In the case of equilateral triangles, the theory predicts
an exotic triatic phase, or 6-atic phase, with six-fold symmetry and three
equivalent directors. Right-angled triangles exhibit a 4-atic phase with strong
octatic (8-atic) correlations. Experiments on cylinders show 4-atic textures
and, even more remarkable, geometric frustration caused by confinement excites
topological defects, which seem to follow the same topological rules as
standard liquid crystals. Some of our findings can be understood with the help
of simulations of hard particles subject to thermal equilibrium, although
standard Density-Functional Theories fail to account for the correct
equilibrium phases in some cases.

<h3>Influence of orientation-dependent lath martensite yielding on the  hardening behavior of quenched martensitic steels</h3>

<br>
<br>
The onset of plasticity in quenched martensitic microstructures is
characterized by a low initial yield stress followed by an extremely strong
initial hardening response, and then a sudden hardening saturation. Literature
attributes this behavior to residual stresses and dislocations inherited from
the martensitic transformation, or to microstructural heterogeneities causing
strength differences among the grains. Here, we argue that
orientation-dependent yielding of lath martensite due to inter-lath sliding,
which induces a substructure boundary sliding mechanism, may also contribute
significantly to the observed behavior. To demonstrate this, we systematically
study its quantitative contribution to the elasto-plastic transition behavior
in a numerical microstructural model. In the simulations, we employ an
effective laminate model for the martensite packets which takes into account
the yielding anisotropy due to sliding along the packet's habit plane
orientation. To account for the effect of carbon content, martensitic
microstructures with different levels of lath strength are considered. It is
shown that the martensite packets with a favorable habit plane orientation
start to yield earlier compared to those with an unfavorable orientation, which
initially remain elastic. As a consequence, the macro-scale response of the
microstructures exhibits a low yield stress, followed by a significant degree
of initial hardening which continues until the saturation stress level is
approached. The apparent work hardening rate depends on the contrast between
the in-habit plane and out-of-habit plane yield strength used in the model.

<h3>Amphiphilic diblock copolymers as functional surfaces for protein  chromatography</h3>

Stationary phase plays a crucial role in the operation of a protein
chromatography column. Conventional resins composed of acrylic polymers and
their derivatives contribute to heterogeneity of the packing of stationary
phase inside these columns. Alternative polymer combinations through customized
surface functionalization schemes which consist of multiple steps using static
coating techniques are well known. In comparison, it is hypothesized that a
single-step scheme is sufficient to obtain porous adsorbents as stationary
phase for tuning surface morphology and protein immobilization. To overcome the
challenge of heterogeneous packing and ease of fabrication at a laboratory
scale, a change in the form factor of separation materials has been proposed in
the form of functional copolymer surfaces. In the present work, an amphiphilic,
block copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) has been chosen
and fully characterized for its potential usage in protein chromatography.
Hydrophilicity of the acrylic copolymer and abundance of carboxyl groups
inherently on the copolymer surface have been successfully demonstrated through
contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. Morphological studies indicate
presence of a microporous region (nearly 1 to 1.5 $\mu$m pore size) that could
be beneficial as a cation exchange media as part of the stationary phase in
protein chromatography.

<h3>Quantum magnetoresistance of Weyl semimetals with strong Coulomb  disorder</h3>

<i>Ya. I. Rodionov, K. I. Kugel, B.A. Aronzon</i>
<br>

We study the effects a strong Coulomb disorder on the transverse
magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetals at low temperatures. Using the
diagrammatic technique and the Keldysh model to sum up the leading terms in the
diagrammatic expansion, we find that the linear magnetoresistance exhibits a
strong renormalization due to the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction
$\rho_{xx} \propto H\ln(eH\hbar v^2/cT^2_{\rm imp}),\ \ \Omega\alpha^{-1/6}\ll
T_{\rm imp}\ll \Omega/\alpha^{-3/4}$, where $\Omega = v\sqrt{2eH\hbar/c}$ is
the distance between the zeroth and the first Landau levels, $T_{\rm imp}=\hbar
vn^{1/3}_{\rm imp}$ measures the strength of the impurity potential in terms of
the impurity concentration $n$ and the Fermi velocity $v$, and $\alpha =
e^2/\hbar v$ is the effective fine structure constant of the material. As
disorder becomes even stronger (but still in the parametric range, where the
Coulomb interaction can be treated as a long-range one), we find that the
magnetoresistivity becomes quadratic in the magnetic field $\rho_{xx}\propto
H^2$.

<h3>Temperature-Dependent Dynamic Disproportionation in LiNiO$_2$</h3>

The layered oxide LiNiO$_2$ is the model system for high-performance Ni-rich
cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Here we investigate computationally the
local electronic and spin structure and dynamics of nickels in LiNiO$_2$. Ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations suggest that disproportionation of
spin-half ($S = 1/2$) nickels to $S = 0$ and $S = 1$ is favored towards
cryogenic temperatures. Upon heating, the spin states of the nickels
interconvert between $0$, $1/2$, and $1$ on a sub-picosecond timescale. We
propose that the transitions between differing states of the Ni correspond to
the heat-activated electronic conduction in LiNiO$_2$. The $S = 1$ nickels are
also found to stabilize antisite nickel defects via antiferromagnetic
interactions. Finally, we suggest avenues for the experimental verification of
our hypothesis.

<h3>Geometric cumulants associated with adiabatic cycles crossing degeneracy  points: Application to finite size scaling of metal-insulator transitions in  crystalline electronic systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09073" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09073</a>
<br>
<i>Balázs Hetényi, Sertaç Cengiz</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we focus on two questions. One, we complement the machinary to
calculate geometric phases along adiabatic cycles as follows. The geometric
phase is a line integral along an adiabatic cycle, and if the cycle encircles a
degeneracy point, the phase becomes non-trivial. If the cycle crosses the
degeneracy point the phase diverges. We construct quantities which are
well-defined when the path crosses the degeneracy point. We do this by
constructing a generalized Bargmann invariant, and noting that it can be
interpreted as a cumulant generating function, with the geometric phase being
the first cumulant. We show that particular ratios of cumulants remain finite
for cycles crossing a set of isolated degeneracy points. The cumulant ratios
take the form of the Binder cumulants known from the theory of finite size
scaling in statistical mechanics (we name them geometric Binder cumulants).
Two, we show that the machinery developed can be applied to perform finite size
scaling in the context of the modern theory of polarization. The geometric
Binder cumulants are size independent at gap closure points or regions with
closed gap (Luttinger liquid). We demonstrate this by model calculations for a
one-dimensional topological model, several two-dimensional models, and a
one-dimensional correlated model. In the case of two dimensions we analyze to
different situations, one in which the Fermi surface is one-dimensional (a
line), and two cases in which it is zero dimensional (Dirac points). For the
geometric Binder cumulants the gap closure points can be found by one
dimensional scaling even in two dimensions. As a technical point we stress that
only certain finite difference approximations for the cumulants are applicable,
since not all approximation schemes are capable of extracting the size scaling
information in the case of a closed gap system.

The need to acquire multiple angle-resolved electron energy loss spectra
(EELS) is one of the several critical challenges associated with electron
magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) experiments. If the experiments are
performed by scanning a nanometer to atomic-sized electron probe on a specific
region of a sample, the precision of the local magnetic information extracted
from such data highly depends on the accuracy of the spatial registration
between multiple scans. For an EMCD experiment in a 3-beam orientation, this
means that the same specimen area must be scanned four times while keeping all
the experimental conditions same. This is a non-trivial task as there is a high
chance of morphological and chemical modification as well as non-systematic
local orientation variations of the crystal between the different scans due to
beam damage, contamination and spatial drift. In this work, we employ a
custom-made quadruple aperture to acquire the four EELS spectra needed for the
EMCD analysis in a single electron beam scan, thus removing the above-mentioned
complexities. We demonstrate a quantitative EMCD result for a beam convergence
angle corresponding to sub-nm probe size and compare the EMCD results for
different detector geometries.

Spin-charge interconversion (SCI) is a central phenomenon to the development
of spintronic devices from materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In
the case of materials with high crystal symmetry, the only allowed SCI
processes are those where the spin current, charge current and spin
polarization directions are orthogonal to each other. Consequently, standard
SCI experiments are designed to maximize the signals arising from the SCI
processes with conventional mutually orthogonal geometry. However, in
low-symmetry materials, certain non-orthogonal SCI processes are also allowed.
Since the standard SCI experiment is limited to charge current flowing only in
one direction in the SOC material, certain allowed SCI configurations remain
unexplored. In this work, we performed a thorough SCI study in a graphene-based
lateral spin valve combined with low-symmetry MoTe$_2$. Due to a very low
contact resistance between the two materials, we could detect SCI signals using
both a standard configuration, where the charge current is applied along the
MoTe$_2$, and a recently introduced (3D-current) configuration, where the
charge current flow can be controlled in three directions within the
heterostructure. As a result, we observed three different SCI components, one
orthogonal and two non-orthogonal, giving new insight into the SCI processes in
low-symmetry materials. The large SCI signals obtained at room temperature,
along with the versatility of the 3D-current configuration, provide feasibility
and flexibility to the design of the next generation of spin-based devices.

In this work, we theoretically investigate the light-induced topological
phases and finite-size crossovers in a paradigmatic quantum spin Hall (QSH)
system with high-frequency pumping optics. Taking the HgTe quantum well for
example, our numerical results show that circularly polarized light can break
time-reversal symmetry and induce the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase. In
particular, the coupling between the edge states is spin dependent, and it is
related not only to the size of the system but also to the strength of the
polarized pumping optics. By tuning the two parameters (system width and
optical pumping strength), we obtain four transport regimes, namely QSH, QAH,
edge conducting, and normal insulator. These four different transport regimes
have contrasting edge conducting properties which will feature prominently in
transport experiments on various topological materials.

<br>
<br>
In the archetypal antiferroelectric PbZrO3, antiparallel electric dipoles
cancel each other, resulting in zero spontaneous polarisation at the
macroscopic level. Yet in actual hysteresis loops, the cancellation is rarely
perfect and some remnant polarization is often observed, suggesting the
metastability of polar phases in this material. In this work, using
aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy methods on a
PbZrO3 single crystal, we uncover the coexistence of the common
antiferroelectric phase and a ferrielectric phase featuring an electric dipole
pattern of "up down up". This dipole arrangement, predicted by Aramberri et al.
(2021) to be the ground state of PbZrO3 at 0K, appears at room temperature in
the form of translational boundaries that aggregate to form wider stripe
domains of the polar phase embedded within the antiferroelectric matrix.

One-dimensional ultracold bosonic gases with contact interactions are
described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model. In the case of 1D dysprosium
gases, two open questions are whether its strong dipole-dipole interactions
produce measurable effects in equilibrium and whether a description based on
the Lieb-Liniger model is still applicable. In this work, we measure the
rapidity and momentum distributions of low-temperature equilibrium states of
highly magnetic 1D dysprosium Bose gases. We tune the strength of the dipolar
interactions by changing the magnetic field orientation and compare the
measurements to the Lieb-Liniger model predictions obtained using the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (for rapidity) and path-integral quantum Monte Carlo
(for momentum). The theory quantitatively describes the experiments most
closely in the Tonks-Girardeau limit. The agreement worsens at intermediate
interactions, but theory nevertheless tracks the overall experimental trends.
Our results show that the dipolar interactions have a significant effect, which
weakens as one approaches the Tonks-Girardeau limit, and suggest that the
Lieb-Liniger model is a good starting point for describing near-ground-state
dipolar 1D gases.
