<h3>ModMax Electrodynamics and Charged Particles</h3>

We consider couplings of electrically and magnetically charged sources to the
maximally symmetric non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory called ModMax. The
aim is to reveal physical effects which distinguish ModMax from Maxwell's
electrodynamics. We find that, in contrast to generic models of non-linear
electrodynamics, Lienard-Wiechert fields induced by a moving electric or
magnetic particle, or a dyon are exact solutions of the ModMax equations of
motion. We then study whether and how ModMax non-linearity affects properties
of electromagnetic interactions of charged objects, in particular the Lorentz
force, the Coulomb law, the Lienard-Wiechert fields, Dirac's and Schwinger's
quantization of electric and magnetic charges, and the Compton Effect. In
passing we also present an alternative form of the ModMax Lagrangian in terms
of the coupling of Maxwell's theory to axion-dilaton-like auxiliary scalar
fields which may be relevant for revealing the effective field theory origin of
ModMax.

<h3>Sub picosecond steering of ultrafast incoherent emission from semiconductor metasurfaces</h3>

The ability to dynamically steer fs pulses from a monolithically integrated
source is a critical milestone for the fields of nanophotonics and ultrafast
optics. The nascent field of reconfigurable metasurfaces -- made of optically
resonant meta-atoms -- has shown great promise in manipulating light-matter
interactions through subwavelength control of the phase, amplitude, and
polarization of light. These active metasurfaces arbitrarily transform an
incident wavefront using a reconfigurable spatial phase profile and thus have
been limited to manipulating coherent external sources. Light emitting
metasurfaces obtained through integration of incoherent emitters with
meta-atoms, have been used to statically increase the quantum efficiency of the
emission through Purcell factor enhancement and control the far-field emission
properties of the light to collimate and focus spontaneous emission. Active
manipulation of such incoherent light sources, however, remains a challenge as
current phase-sensitive approaches used for coherent sources cannot be directly
applied. Spatiotemporal control at ultrafast timescales of incoherent light
emission could lead to a transformative technological leap allowing low-power
light emitting diodes (LEDs) to replace high-power coherent laser sources,
enabling holographic LED displays and other key optical transceiver
applications including remote-sensing, perception, and high-speed optical
communication systems. In this work, we theoretically predict and
experimentally demonstrate for the first time, sub-picosecond steering over a
70{\deg} range of ultrafast incoherent emission from a light emitting
metasurface.

<h3>First passage statistics of active random walks on one and two dimensional lattices</h3>

We investigate the first passage statistics of active continuous time random
walks with Poisson waiting time distribution on a one dimensional infinite
lattice and a two dimensional infinite square lattice. We study the small and
large time properties of the probability of the first return to the origin as
well as the probability of the first passage to an arbitrary lattice site.
Interestingly, we show that while the occupation probabilities of an active
random walk resemble that of an ordinary Brownian motion with an effective
diffusion constant at large times, the first passage probabilities do not
exhibit this effective Brownian behavior even at the leading order. We
demonstrate that at late times, activity enhances the probability of the first
return to the origin and the probabilities of the first passage to lattice
sites close enough to the origin, which we quantify in terms of the P\'eclet
number. Additionally, we derive the first passage probabilities of a symmetric
random walker and a biased random walker without activity as limiting cases. We
verify our analytic results by performing kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of an
active random walker in one and two dimensions.

<h3>Actively tuning anisotropic light-matter interaction in biaxial hyperbolic material $Î±$-MoO$_3$ using phase change material VO$_2$ and graphene</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04534v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04534v1</a>

Anisotropic hyperbolic phonon polaritons (PhPs) in natural biaxial hyperbolic
material MoO$_3$ has opened up new avenues for mid-infrared nanophotonics,
while active tunability of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ PhPs is still an urgent problem
needing to be solved.In this study, we present a theoretical demonstration of
actively tuning $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ PhPs using phase change material VO$_2$ and
graphene. It is observed that $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ PhPs are greatly depending on
the propagation plane angle of PhPs. The metal-to-insulator phase transition of
VO$_2$ has a significant effect on the hybridization PhPs of the
$\alpha$-MoO$_3$/VO$_2$ structure and allows to obtain an actively tunable
$\alpha$-MoO$_3$ PhPs, which is especially obvious when the propagation plane
angle of PhPs is 90.
