<p>The transport properties of strongly interacting fermionic systems can reveal
exotic states of matter, but experiments and theory have predominantly focused
on bulk systems in the hydrodynamic limit describable with linear response
coefficients such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In a ballistic
channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs, recent experiments revealed a
far-from-equilibrium regime beyond linear hydrodynamics where particle and
entropy currents respond nonlinearly to biases of chemical potential and
temperature, and their ratio is robust to the channel geometry. However, the
origin of this robustness and its relation to the strong interparticle
interactions remain unknown. Here, we study the coupled transport of particles
and entropy tuning the interaction across the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer to
Bose-Einstein condensate (BCS-BEC) crossover, the reservoir degeneracy across
the superfluid phase transition, as well as the local potentials and
confinement of the channel. Surprisingly, the entropy advectively transported
per particle depends only on the interactions and reservoir degeneracy and not
on the details of the channel, suggesting that this property has its origin in
the universal equilibrium properties of the reservoirs. In contrast, the
magnitudes of the advective and diffusive entropy currents vary significantly
with the channel details. The advective current increases monotonically towards
the BEC side, which can be largely explained by the estimated superfluid gap in
the channel. The Wiedemann-Franz law that links the advective and diffusive
currents in Fermi liquids is most egregiously violated at unitarity, suggesting
a change in the nature of the excitations responsible for entropy diffusion
near unitarity. These observations pose fundamental questions regarding
transport phenomena in strongly interacting Fermi systems far from equilibrium.

<h3>Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17050" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17050</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anjishnu Bose, Samuel Vadnais, Arun Paramekanti</i>
<p>Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and
altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon
lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin
exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal
symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features
multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation
symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero
net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we
vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order,
superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states,
incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting
singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase
separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. Our
results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM
materials.

<h3>Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17058" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17058</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kang Wang, Siyu Chen, Sun-Woo Kim, Bartomeu Monserrat</i>
<p>Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer
kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains a challenge. Experimentally, upon cooling,
short-range CDW order with the wave vector
$\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ is observed, which is
subsequently suppressed by the condensation of the long-range CDW order
$\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ at lower temperature. In
conflict with these observations, theoretical calculations overestimate the
transition temperature by a few thousand Kelvin and incorrectly predict the
$\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order to be the ground state. Here, we develop a theory of
CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ based on anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations
combined with density functional theory. We predict a temperature-driven phase
transition from the high-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW to the
low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW order, fully explaining experimental
observations. Additionally, we clarify that both multi-phonon effects and
semi-core electron states play a crucial role in stabilizing the
$\mathbf{q}_{3}$ order. Finally, we construct a phase diagram of the competing
CDWs in the lattice parameter space and demonstrate that the out-of-plane
lattice parameter plays a pivotal role in manipulating the competing CDWs in
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an
experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order. Our work
provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental
observations and resolving ealier discrepancies between theory and experiment.
Overall, our work contributes to the wider effort of understanding CDWs in the
kagome metal family.

<h3>Tensor network formulation of symmetry protected topological phases in  mixed states</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hanyu Xue, Jong Yeon Lee, Yimu Bao</i>
<p>We define and classify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed
states based on the tensor network formulation of the density matrix. In one
dimension, we introduce strong injective matrix product density operators
(MPDO), which describe a broad class of short-range correlated mixed states,
including the locally decohered SPT states. We map strong injective MPDO to a
pure state in the doubled Hilbert space and define the SPT phases according to
the cohomology class of the symmetry group in the doubled state. Although the
doubled state exhibits an enlarged symmetry, the possible SPT phases are also
constrained by the Hermiticity and the semi-positivity of the density matrix.
We here obtain a complete classification of SPT phases with a direct product of
strong $G$ and weak $K$ unitary symmetry given by the cohomology group
$\mathcal{H}^2(G, \text{U}(1))\oplus\mathcal{H}^1(K, \mathcal{H}^1(G,
\text{U}(1)))$. The SPT phases in our definition are preserved under symmetric
local circuits consisting of non-degenerate channels. This motivates an
alternative definition of SPT phases according to the equivalence class of
mixed states under a ``one-way" connection using symmetric non-degenerate
channels. In locally purifiable MPDO with strong symmetry, we prove that this
alternative definition reproduces the cohomology classification. We further
extend our results to two-dimensional mixed states described by strong
semi-injective tensor network density operators and classify the possible SPT
phases.

<h3>Quantum Liquids: Emergent higher-rank gauge theory and fractons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17074</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yizhi You</i>
<p>Fracton emerges from strongly interacting many-body systems whose
excitations, referred to as sub-dimensional particles, have restricted mobility
or kinetic motions. These entities have garnered significant interest due to
their interdisciplinary implications spanning topological quantum codes,
quantum field theory, emergent gravity, quantum information, and more,
revealing unique nonequilibrium behaviors such as nonergodicity and glassy
dynamics. This review presents a structured and educational overview of fracton
phenomena, specifically focusing on gapless fracton liquids. Noteworthy for
their compressibility and gapless excitations, fracton liquids facilitate
collective modes reminiscent of those gauge fluctuations found in Maxwell's
electromagnetic framework. However, they are distinct due to an additional
higher-moment conservation law that restricts the mobility of individual
charges and monopoles. Our exploration begins with the theoretical foundation
of 3D fracton liquids, presenting a variety of emergent symmetric tensor gauge
theories and reviewing their equilibrium and dynamic properties. Following this
theoretical groundwork, we discuss the material realization of various fracton
liquids in Yb-based breathing pyrochlore lattices, close-packed tiling
structures and other synthetic quantum matter platforms. Additionally, we
introduce a general protocol to foster and manipulate emergent fracton spin
liquids in the realm of frustrated magnetism.

<p>Pressure evolution of the crystal structure and magnetism of the honeycomb
$\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ is studied using high-pressure x-ray diffraction,
magnetometry, and density-functional band-structure calculations. Hydrostatic
compression transforms antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ ($R\bar 3$) into
paramagnetic $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ ($P\bar 1$) where short Ru-Ru bonds cause
magnetism collapse above 1.3 GPa at 0 K and 2.5 GPa at 295 K. Below this
critical pressure, the N\'eel temperature of $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ increases with
the slope of 1.8 K/GPa. Pressure tunes $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ away from the Kitaev
limit, whereas increased third-neighbor in-plane coupling and interlayer
coupling lead to a further stabilization of the collinear zigzag state. Both
$\alpha$- and $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ are metastable at ambient pressure, but their
transformation into the thermodynamically stable $\beta$-polymorph is
kinetically hindered at room temperature.

<h3>Scaling tunnelling noise in the fractional quantum Hall effect tells  about renormalization and breakdown of chiral Luttinger liquid</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17097</a>
<br>
</p><i>Noam Schiller, Tomer Alkalay, Changki Hong, Vladimir Umansky, Moty Heiblum, Yuval Oreg, Kyrylo Snizhko</i>
<p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect provides a paradigmatic example of a
topological phase of matter. FQH edges are theoretically described via models
belonging to the class of chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) theories [1 (Wen,
2007)]. These theories predict exotic properties of the excitations, such as
fractional charge and fractional statistics. Despite theoretical confidence in
this description and qualitative experimental confirmations, quantitative
experimental evidence for CLL behaviour is scarce. In this work, we study
tunnelling between edge modes in the quantum Hall regime at the filling factor
$\nu=1/3$. We present measurements at different system temperatures and perform
a novel scaling analysis of the experimental data, originally proposed in Ref.
[2 (Schiller et al., 2022)]. Our analysis shows clear evidence of CLL breakdown
- above a certain energy scale. In the low-energy regime, where the scaling
behaviour holds, we extract the property called the scaling dimension and find
it heavily renormalized compared to na\"ive CLL theory predictions. Our results
show that decades-old experiments contain a lot of previously overlooked
information that can be used to investigate the physics of quantum Hall edges.
In particular, we open a road to quantitative experimental studies of (a)
scaling dimension renormalization in quantum point contacts and (b) CLL
breakdown mechanisms at an intermediate energy scale, much smaller than the
bulk gap.

<h3>A Brief Survey of Fluctuation-induced Interactions in Micro- and  Nano-systems and One Exactly Solvable Model as Example</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17109</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daniel Dantchev, Nicholay Tonchev</i>
<p>Fluctuations exist in any material object $A$. If $A$ has non-zero
temperature $T$, one speaks about thermal fluctuations. If $A$ is at very low
$T$, the fluctuations are of quantum origin. Interesting effects appear if two
bodies $A$ and $B$ are separated by a fluctuating medium $C$ (say a vacuum, or
a fluid close to its {\it critical point}) when the fluctuations are
long-ranged, i.e., they decay according to a power-law with the distance. Then
the changes of fluctuations in $C$ due to the surfaces and constituents of $A$
are also felt by $B$, and \textit{vice versa}, which leads to a fluctuation
induced force (FIF) between them. This force persists in addition to the direct
influence of $A$ on $B$ (say, via gravity or Coulomb's force). These FIF's can
be of attractive or repulsive character. They may play crucially important role
on phenomena involving objects with length scale comparative with the Universe,
as well as to the tiny objects relevant for MEMS and NEMS. In the current
article we present some basic facts for the FIF and their diversity. Then on
the example of one dimensional Ising model with a defect bond we present some
new analytical results for such forces.

<h3>Spin-state ordering and intermediate states in the mixed-valence cobalt  oxyborate Co$_3$O$_2$BO$_3$ with spin crossover</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17113" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17113</a>
<br>
</p><i>E. Granado, C. W. Galdino, B. D. Moreno, G. King, D. C. Freitas</i>
<p>Spin-state ordering - a periodic pattern of ions with different spin-state
configurations along a crystal lattice - is a rare phenomenon, and its possible
interrelation with other electronic degrees of freedom remains little explored.
Here we perform a structural investigation of the mixed-valence Co homometallic
ludwigite Co$_2^{2+}$Co$^{3+}$O$_2$BO$_3$. A superstructure consistent with a
long-range Co$^{3+}$ spin-state ordering is observed between $T_{4}=580$ K and
$T_{3}=510$ K. Intermediate states with mesoscopic correlations are detected
below $T_{3}$ down to $T_{1}=480$ K with a change of dimensionality at
$T_{2}=495$ K. The spin-state correlations are connected to the charge sector
as revealed by the abrupt changes in the electrical resistance at $T_1$ and
$T_2$. The evolution of the structural parameters below $T_{1}$ indicate that
the spin crossover is ignited by a moderate degree of thermally-induced
Co$^{2+}$/Co$^{3+}$ charge disorder. Charge and spin-state degrees of freedom
can be interrelated in mixed-valence spin-crossover materials, leading to sharp
transitions involving intermediate spin-state/charge correlated states at the
mesoscale.

<h3>Floquet Prethermal Order by Disorder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17118</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hui-Ke Jin, Johannes Knolle</i>
<p>Frustrated magnets can have accidental ground state degeneracies which may be
lifted by various forms of disorder, for example in the form of thermal or
quantum fluctuations. This order by disorder (ObD) paradigm is well established
in equilibrium and here is generalized to Floquet many-body systems.
Investigating a periodically-driven XXZ-compass model on the square lattice, we
show that in a prethermal regime, dynamical fluctuations induced by
high-frequency drives select a discrete set of states out of a degenerate
ground state manifold of the lowest order Floquet Hamiltonian chosen as initial
states. Remarkably, prior to the ObD selection, an unusual fluctuating regime
emerges leading to a prethermalization timescale scaling linearly with the
drive frequency. We argue that prethermal ObD with its unusual approach to the
selected states is a generic phenomenon of driven frustrated systems and
confirm it in the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ XX model.

<h3>Spin-orbit proximity in MoS$_2$/bilayer graphene heterostructures</h3>

<p>Van der Waals heterostructures provide a versatile platform for tailoring
electronic properties through the integration of two-dimensional materials.
Among these combinations, the interaction between bilayer graphene and
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stands out due to its potential for
inducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene. Future devices concepts require
the understanding the precise nature of SOC in TMD/bilayer graphene
heterostructures and its influence on electronic transport phenomena. Here, we
experimentally confirm the presence of two distinct types of SOC, Ising (1.55
meV) and Rashba (2.5 meV), in bilayer graphene when interfaced with molybdenum
disulphide, recognized as one of the most stable TMDs. Furthermore, we reveal a
non-monotonic trend in conductivity with respect to the electric displacement
field at charge neutrality. This phenomenon is ascribed to the existence of
single-particle gaps induced by the Ising SOC, which can be closed by a
critical displacement field. Remarkably, our findings also unveil sharp peaks
in the magnetoconductivity around the critical displacement field, challenging
existing theoretical models.

<h3>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17137" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17137</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nilanjan Roy, Bo Peng, Bo Yang</i>
<p>We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the
presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The
interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length
$\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes
corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one
where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic
translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we
show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the
topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of
weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended
states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we
obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime
which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the
superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the
time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It
could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both
continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall
effect.

<h3>Layer-selective spin-orbit coupling and strong correlation in bilayer  graphene</h3>

</p><i>Anna M. Seiler, Yaroslav Zhumagulov, Klaus Zollner, Chiho Yoon, David Urbaniak, Fabian R. Geisenhof, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jaroslav Fabian, Fan Zhang, R. Thomas Weitz</i>
<p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electron-electron interaction can mutually
influence each other and give rise to a plethora of intriguing phenomena in
condensed matter systems. In pristine bilayer graphene, which has weak SOC,
intrinsic Lifshitz transitions and concomitant van-Hove singularities lead to
the emergence of many-body correlated phases. Layer-selective SOC can be
proximity induced by adding a layer of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) on its one
side. By applying an electric displacement field, the system can be tuned
across a spectrum wherein electronic correlation, SOC, or a combination of both
dominates. Our investigations reveal an intricate phase diagram of
proximity-induced SOC-selective bilayer graphene. Not only does this phase
diagram include those correlated phases reminiscent of SOC-free doped bilayer
graphene, but it also hosts unique SOC-induced states allowing a compelling
measurement of valley g-factor and a seemingly impossible correlated insulator
at charge neutrality, thereby showcasing the remarkable tunability of the
interplay between interaction and SOC in WSe2 enriched bilayer graphene.

<h3>Local magnetic response of superconducting  Sr$\mathrm{_2}$RuO$\mathrm{_4}$ thin films and rings</h3>

<p>We conduct local magnetic measurements on superconducting thin-film samples
of Sr$\mathrm{_2}$RuO$\mathrm{_4}$ using scanning Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device (SQUID) susceptometry. From the diamagnetic response, we
extract the magnetic penetration depth, $\lambda$, which exhibits a quadratic
temperature dependence at low temperatures. Although a quadratic dependence in
high-purity bulk samples has been attributed to non-local electrodynamics, our
analysis suggests that in our thin-film samples the presence of scattering is
the origin of the quadratic dependence. While we observe micron-scale
variations in the diamagnetic response and superconducting transition
temperature, the form of the temperature dependence of $\lambda$ is independent
of position. Finally, we characterize flux trapping in superconducting rings
lithographically fabricated from the thin films, paving the way to systematic
device-based tests of the superconducting order parameter in
Sr$\mathrm{_2}$RuO$\mathrm{_4}$.

<h3>Applicability of mean-field theory for time-dependent open quantum  systems with infinite-range interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17163</a>
<br>
</p><i>Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky</i>
<p>Understanding quantum many-body systems with long-range or infinite-range
interactions is of relevance across a broad set of physical disciplines,
including quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear physics. From
a theoretical viewpoint, these systems are appealing since they can be
efficiently studied with numerics, and in the thermodynamic limit are expected
to be governed by mean-field equations of motion. Over the past years the
capabilities to experimentally create long-range interacting systems have
dramatically improved permitting their control in space and time. This allows
to induce and explore a plethora of nonequilibrium dynamical phases, including
time-crystals and even chaotic regimes. However, establishing the emergence of
these phases from numerical simulations turns out to be surprisingly
challenging. This difficulty led to the assertion that mean-field theory may
not be applicable to time-dependent infinite-range interacting systems. Here,
we rigorously prove that mean-field theory in fact exactly captures their
dynamics, in the thermodynamic limit. We further provide bounds for finite-size
effects and their dependence on the evolution time.

<p>High In content InGaAs quantum wells (In $\geq$ 75%) are potentially useful
for topological quantum computing and spintronics applications. In high
mobility InGaAs quantum wells, alloy disorder scattering is a limiting factor.
In this report, we demonstrate that by growing the InGaAs quantum wells as a
digital alloy, or a short period superlattice, we can reduce the alloy disorder
scattering within the quantum well and increase the peak 2 K electron mobility
to 545,000 cm^2/V s, which is the highest reported mobility for high In content
InGaAs quantum wells to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our results
demonstrate that the digital alloy approach can be used to increase the
mobility of quantum wells in random alloy ternary materials.

<h3>Magnon-microwave backaction noise evasion in cavity magnomechanics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>V. A. S. V. Bittencourt, C. A. Potts, J. P. Davis, A. Metelmann</i>
<p>In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously
with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, combining the tunability of the
magnetization, the long lifetimes of mechanical modes and the whole measurement
toolbox of microwave systems. Such hybrid systems have been proposed for
applications ranging from thermometry to entanglement generation. However,
backaction noise can hinder the measurement of the mechanical vibrations,
potentially rendering such applications infeasible. In this paper, we
investigate the noise introduced in a mechanical mode of a cavity
magnomechanical system in a one-tone drive scheme and propose a scheme for
realizing backaction evasion measurements of the mechanical vibrations. Our
proposal consists of driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by
twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes balanced to generate equal
numbers of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that different configurations of
such a scheme are possible and show that drives centered around the lower
frequency magnon-microwave polariton in a triple resonance scheme add the
minimum imprecision noise in the measurement, even though such configuration is
not the most robust to imperfections.

<h3>Nonlinear Edelstein Effect in Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jun Ōiké, Robert Peters</i>
<p>Nonlinear spintronics, which combines nonlinear dynamics and spintronics,
opens a new route for controlling spins and spin dynamics beyond conventional
spintronics based on linear responses. Strongly correlated electron systems,
which can have large nonlinear responses, are promising candidates for
nonlinear spintronics. In this paper, we focus on the nonlinear Edelstein
effect (NEE), a generalization of the Edelstein effect, and study the impact of
electron correlations on the NEE by performing numerical calculations on a
Hubbard model. We find that correlation effects can either enhance or suppress
the nonlinear response. We show that the enhancement and suppression of the
response are due to the real and imaginary components of the self-energy,
respectively. Additionally, we have explored the relationship between the NEE
and photomagnetic or optomagnetic effects. Our findings demonstrate that
electron correlations can either enhance or suppress the optical spin
injection, depending on the light frequency, while always strengthening the
inverse Faraday effect.

<p>Among lattice configurations of densely packed hard ellipses, Monte Carlo
simulations are used to identify the so-called parallel and diagonal lattices
as the two favourable states. The free energies of these two states are
computed for several system sizes employing the Einstein Crystal method. An
accurate calculation of the free energy difference between the two states
reveals the parallel lattice as the state with lowest free energy. The origin
of the entropic difference between the two states is further elucidated by
assessing the roles of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.

<p>We report THz-pump / mid-infrared probe near-field studies on Si-doped
GaAs-InGaAs core-shell nanowires utilizing THz radiation from the free-electron
laser FELBE. Upon THz excitation of free carriers, we observe a red shift of
the plasma resonance in both amplitude and phase spectra, which we attribute to
the heating up of electrons in the conduction band. The simulation of heated
electron distributions anticipates a significant electron population in both L-
and X-valleys. The two-temperature model is utilized for a quantitative
analysis of the dynamics of the electron gas temperature under THz pumping at
various power levels.

Rappe, David Reis, Diling Zhu, Keith A. Nelson, Mariano Trigo</i>
<p>The nature of the "failed" ferroelectric transition in SrTiO3 has been a
long-standing puzzle in condensed matter physics. A compelling explanation is
the competition between ferroelectricity and an instability with a mesoscopic
modulation of the polarization. These polarization density waves, which should
become especially strong near the quantum critical point, break local inversion
symmetry and are difficult to probe with conventional x-ray scattering methods.
Here we combine a femtosecond x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) with THz
coherent control methods to probe inversion symmetry breaking at finite momenta
and visualize the instability of the polarization on nanometer lengthscales in
SrTiO3. We find polar-acoustic collective modes that are soft particularly at
the tens of nanometer lengthscale. These precursor collective excitations
provide evidence for the conjectured mesoscopic modulated phase in SrTiO3.

<h3>Unified Differentiable Learning of the Electric Enthalpy and Dielectric  Properties with Exact Physical Constraints</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Stefano Falletta, Andrea Cepellotti, Chuin Wei Tan, Anders Johansson, Albert Musaelian, Cameron J. Owen, Boris Kozinsky</i>
<p>The modern theory of polarization and electric enthalpy functionals have
paved the way to first-principles studies of polarization in crystalline,
disordered and liquid materials. However, calculating the polarization in
large-scale ab-initio molecular dynamics remains prohibitive due to the high
computational cost involved. In this work, we introduce a machine-learning
formulation that simultaneously learns to predict electric enthalpy, atomic
forces, polarization, Born charges, and polarizability for a given atomic
configuration. These quantities are derived through differentiation of the
electric enthalpy with respect to atomic positions and electric field within a
local equivariant representation of the atomic environment. Our new method
exactly constrains the polarization to be a conservative vector field, obeys
the acoustic sum rule for Born charges, and ensures the conservation of
electric enthalpy in machine-learning molecular dynamics. Importantly, the
formulation is general and does not necessarily require equivariance. The
locality of the model enables the efficient calculation of vibrational and
dielectric properties of materials over large length-scale and long time-scale
molecular dynamics at quantum-mechanical accuracy. We apply our approach to
determine the infrared spectrum and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of
$\alpha$-SiO$_2$ using molecular dynamics, finding excellent agreement with
results obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Additionally, we
show that our model accurately captures the electric-field contributions to the
electric enthalpy, forces, and polarization in reference to density functional
theory calculations. This demonstrates the capability of our formulation to
perform large-scale molecular dynamics under electric fields, thus paving the
way to efficient and accurate studies of dielectric response of complex
materials.

<h3>The c-d conjecture</h3>

</p><i>José I. Latorre, Germán Sierra</i>
<p>We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local
nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum
central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose
that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance
lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement
properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem
establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV
lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with
numerous examples.

<p>Active nematics are materials composed of mobile, elongated particles that
can transform energy from the environment into a mechanical motion. Current
experimental realizations of the active nematics are of biological origin and
include cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria in liquid crystal, and
combinations of bio-filaments with molecular motors. Here, we report the
realization of a fully synthetic active nematic system comprised of a lyotropic
chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves. This artificial active
liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits
stable material properties, and enables precise and rapid activity control over
a significantly extended range. We demonstrate that the energy of the acoustic
field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long-range
nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability, development of
active turbulence, and proliferation of topological defects. We reveal the
emergence of unconventional free-standing persistent vortices in the nematic
director field at high activity levels. The results provide a foundation for
the design of externally energized active nematic fluids with stable material
properties and tunable topological defects dynamics crucial for the realization
of reconfigurable microfluidic systems.

</p><i>Demi E. Moed, Michael S. Dimitriyev, Benjamin R. Greenvall, Gregory M. Grason, Alfred J. Crosby</i>
<p>Inspired by adhesive bio-filamentous structure, such as bacterial pili, this
work details the methods used to fabricate and characterize a surface-anchored
array of thin, flexible and shape-responsive mesoscale polymer ribbons with a
length-to-thickness aspect ratio of up to 100,000. The resulting structures
exhibit geometrically complex and dynamic morphologies consistent with
elastocapillary bending that experience an increase in curvature over hours of
aging due to creep. We develop a computational image analysis framework to
generate 3D reconstructions of these densely crowded geometries and extract
quantitative descriptors to demonstrate morphological changes due to aging. We
demonstrate the robustness of this quantitative method by characterizing the
creep-induced change in an aging ribbon array's shape and develop a scaling
relationship to describe the importance of ribbon thickness for shape and
dynamical observations. These methods demonstrate an essential baseline to
probe morphology-property relationships of mesoscale polymer ribbon arrays
fabricated from a variety of materials in numerous environments. Through the
introduction of perfluorodecalin droplets, we illustrate the potential of these
ribbon arrays towards applications in adhesive, microrobotic, and biomedical
devices.

<h3>Utilizing (Al, Ga)2O3/Ga2O3 superlattices to measure cation vacancy  diffusion and vacancy-concentration-dependent diffusion of Al, Sn, and Fe in  \b{eta} -Ga2O3</h3>

<p>Diffusion of native defects such as vacancies and their interactions with
impurities are fundamental in semiconductor crystal growth, device processing,
and long-term aging of equilibration and transient diffusion of vacancies are
rarely investigated. We used aluminum-gallium oxide/gallium oxide superlattices
(SLs) to detect and analyze transient diffusion of cation vacancies during
annealing in O2 at 1000-1100 C. Using a novel finite difference scheme for the
diffusion equation with time- and space-varying diffusion constant, we extract
diffusion constants for Al, Fe, and cation vacancies under the given
conditions, including the vacancy concentration dependence for Al. indicate
that vacancies present in the substrate transiently diffuse through the SLs,
interacting with Sn as it also diffuses. In the case of SLs grown on Sn-doped
beta-gallium oxide substrates, gradients observed in the extent of Al diffusion
indicate that vacancies present in the substrate transiently diffuse through
the SLs, interacting with Sn as it also diffuses. In the case of SLs grown on
(010) Fe-doped substrates, the Al diffusion is uniform through the SLs,
indicating a depth-uniform concentration of vacancies. We find no evidence in
either case for the introduction of gallium vacancies from the free surface at
rates sufficient to affect Al diffusion down to ppm concentrations, which has
important bearing on the validity of typically-made assumptions of vacancy
equilibration. Additionally, we show that unintentional impurities in Sn-doped
gallium oxide such as Fe, Ni, Mn, Cu, and Li also diffuse towards the surface
and accumulate. Many of these likely have fast interstitial diffusion modes
capable of destabilizing devices over time, thus highlighting the importance of
controlling unintentional impurities in beta-gallium oxide wafers.

<p>Using the nuclear norm regularization techniques on tensor network
renormalization algorithm, we study the phase diagram, the critical behavior
and the duality property of the antiferromagnetic 6-state clock model on the
Union Jack lattice. We find that this model undergoes multiple phase
transitions; there is the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless, $Z_{6}$ symmetry
breaking and chiral transition with decreasing temperature. Furthermore, we
provide convincing numerical evidence that its quasi-long range order is well
explained by the compactified boson conformal field theory (CFT) and the chiral
transition is in perfect agreement with the Ising CFT, including central
charge, scaling dimension spectrum, and operator product expansion
coefficients.

<h3>Raman peak shift and broadening in crystalline nanoparticles with  lattice impurities</h3>

<br>
</p><i>S.V. Koniakhin, O.I. Utesov, A.G. Yashenkin</i>
<p>The effect of point-like lattice impurities on nanoparticle Raman spectra
(RS) is studied using both numerical and analytical methods. Particular cases
of replacement atoms of various masses, vacancies, and disorder in interatomic
bonds are considered. It is shown that the disorder leads not only to the
broadening of optical phonon lines but also to the shift of the corresponding
Raman peak. The latter can be either positive (i.e., blueshift) or negative
(redshift) depending on the type of impurities. Thus there is an additional
contribution to the well-known redshift that occurs due to the
size-quantization (confinement) effect. Considering nanometer-sized diamond
particles as a representative example, we show that the broadening and the
shift are, as a rule, of the same order of magnitude. The results are discussed
in the framework of the self-consistent T-matrix approach. It is argued that
both effects should be considered for accurate treatment of experimental Raman
spectra. Simple recipes to do so are formulated for several important cases
including NV centers in nanodiamonds.

<h3>Unveiling the origin of unconventional moire ferroelectricity</h3>

<p>Interfacial ferroelectricity emerges in heterostructures consisting of
nonpolar van der Waals (vdW) layers, greatly expanding the scope of two
dimensional ferroelectrics. In particular, the unconventional moire
ferroelectricity observed in bilayer graphene/boron nitride (BN)
heterostructures, exhibits promising functionalities with topological current,
superconductivity and synaptic responses. However, the debate about its
mechanism - correlation driven charge transfer between two graphene layers -
limits device reproducibility and hence large-scale production. Here by
designing a single-layer graphene encapsulated by lattice-mismatched WSe2, we
identify the ferroelectricity as stemming from - instead of graphene moire
bands - the particular BN, where interfacial sliding ferroelectricity must play
a role. With similar structures, multilayer twisted MoS2 is found to reproduce
the ferroelectricity. The key is a conductive moire ferroelectric, where the
screened gate and the pinned domain wall together result in unchanged
electronic states, i.e. anomalous screening. The intimate connection to
interfacial sliding ferroelectricity thus provides advantages of diverse
choices of constituent materials and robust polarization switching while
preserving the unique anomalous screening, paving the way to reproducible and
reliable memory-based devices in artificial intelligence.

<p>Materials systems with spin chirality can provide ultra-high-density,
ultra-fast, and ultralow-power information carriers for digital transformation.
These material systems include magnetic skyrmions, chiral domain walls, spin
reorientation,and so on. The topological Hall effect (THE) has been identified
as the most convenient and effective tool for detecting the presence of spin
chirality in these systems. The research on the THE that may arise from spin
reorientation and specifically in Fe3Ge with spin reorientation remains an
unexplored area, so we study the THE in Fe3Ge Conduct systematic research.
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) results indicate that our Fe3Ge ribbon sample has a
D019 structure. First-principles calculations and magnetic and electrical
testing confirm spin reorientation in the Fe3Ge ribbon sample at 350 K.The Hall
resistivity test results are consistent with our expectations, indicating the
presence of the THE in the Fe3Ge ribbon sample. The topological Hall
resistivity reaches a maximum value of 0.69 m{\Omega} cm at 400 K. For the
first time, a detailed experimental study of the THE in Fe3Ge with spin
reorientation has been conducted, introducing a new member to the family of

<p>Gauge fields are ubiquitous in modern quantum physics. In superfluids,
quantized vortices can be induced by gauge fields. Here we demonstrate the
first experimental observation of vortex nucleations in spinor Bose-Einstein
Condensates under radially-localized synthetic magnetic fields. The associated
gauge potentials $\vec{A}$ are azimuthal and created by light-induced
spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling, generating circulating azimuthal
velocity fields $\propto \vec{p}-\vec{A}$ even when the canonical momentum
$\vec{p}= 0$. A sufficiently large azimuthal velocity peaked near the
condensate center results in a dynamically unstable localized excitation that
initiates vortex nucleations. This excitation appears as a spontaneously-formed
vortex-antivortex pair near the cloud center. Following the initially developed
instability, the dynamics is governed by the asymmetry and dissipation, where
the atomic orbital angular momentum evolves and can reach the value of the
ground state. Our system exhibits dynamical and Landau instabilities and agrees
reasonably with time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.

<p>An antiferromagnetic metal with two-dimensional triangular network offers a
unique playground of intriguing magneto-transport properties and
functionalities stemming from interplay between conducting electrons and
intricate magnetic phases. A NiAs-type CrSe is one of the candidates owing to
alternate stackings of Cr and Se triangular atomic networks in its crystal
structure. While fabrication of CrSe thin films is indispensable to develop
functional devices, studies on its thin-film properties have been limited to
date due to the lack of metallic samples. Here, we report on realization of
metallic conductivities of CrSe thin films, which allows to investigate their
intrinsic magneto-transport properties. The metallic sample exhibits
co-occurrence of a weak ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
and the antiferromagnetic behavior, indicating the presence of non-coplanar
spin structures. In addition, control of polarity and tilting angle of the
non-coplanar spin structure is accomplished by a sign of cooling magnetic
fields. The observed non-coplanar spin structure, which can be a source of
emergent magnetic field acting on the conducting electrons, highlights a high
potential of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet and provide unique platform
for functional thin-film devices composed of NiAs-type derivative Cr
chalcogenides and pnictides.

<p>We study low-lying spin-singlet excitations of two-leg Hubbard ladders with
site-dependent potentials. Using general formulas of the charge
disproportionation induced by the site-dependent potentials, we derive the
contributions of spin degrees of freedom to the spectral functions such as the
dynamical charge structure factor $N(\boldsymbol{k},\omega)$ and the optical
conductivity $\sigma_{\gamma}(\omega)$ along the $\gamma(=x,y)$-direction of
the two-leg ladders. Numerical results obtained by the Lanczos diagonalization
method have clarified that the multi-triplon singlet states, including two- and
three-triplon excitations, can be detected by observing these quantities.
Furthermore, we have found that ladders with random potentials also have
non-negligible contributions of these excitations to $\sigma_x(\omega)$.

<p>To achieve atomic-level characterization of the diamond (001) surface,
persistent efforts have been made over the past few decades. The motivation
behind the pursuit extends beyond investigating surface defects and adsorbates;
it also involves unraveling the mystery of the smooth growth of diamond.
However, the inherently low conductivity and the short C-C bonds render atomic
resolution imaging exceptionally challenging. Here, we successfully overcame
these challenges by employing non-contact atomic force microscopy with reactive
Si tips. Atomic resolution imaging was achieved even at room temperature. With
density-functional-theory calculations, we clarified that the critical factors
for atomic resolution are in the formation of tilted C-Si bonds between
scanning probes and surfaces, along with reordering of the surface C-C dimers.
Implications of the findings extend beyond the realm of surface
characterization. The present atomic-resolution microscopies drive future
advancements in diamond technologies by providing avenues for identifying
dopants and constructing artificial nanostructures.

<p>We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of
a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for
various pairing states. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the
dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and
$p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are robust against varying the
altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$-
or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic behavior as
a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs.
Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as

<p>Active renewable matter, a distinctive feature of adaptive living materials,
can exhibit highly unusual mechanical responses by actively navigating the
space of material parameters. In particular, it can self-drive towards elastic
spinodals where the presence of inhomogeneous floppy modes, makes the matter
elastically degenerate. The main effect of the implied marginality is stress
localization leading to the emergence of force chains which can be actively
assembled and disassembled. In this Letter we formalize the concept of spinodal
states for general elastic solids and show how such extreme mechanical regimes
can be actively navigated.

<p>We report on a new technique for measuring the dynamic Young's modulus, $E$,
of quantum materials at low temperatures as a function of static tuning strain,
$\epsilon$, in piezoactuator-driven pressure cells. In addition to a static
tuning of stress and strain, we apply a small-amplitude, finite-frequency a.c.
(1 Hz$ \lesssim \omega \lesssim $1000 Hz) uniaxial stress, $\sigma_{ac}$, to
the sample and measure the resulting a.c. strain, $\epsilon_{ac}$, using a
capacitive sensor to obtain the associated modulus $E$. We demonstrate the
performance of the new technique through proof-of-principle experiments on the
unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is known for its rich
temperature-strain phase diagram. In particular, we show that the magnitude of
$E$, measured using this a.c. technique at low frequencies, exhibits a
pronounced nonlinear elasticity, which is in very good agreement with previous
Young's modulus measurements on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under [100] strain using a d.c.
method (Noad et al., Science 382, 447-450 (2023)). By combining the new a.c.
Young's modulus measurements with a.c. elastocaloric measurements in a single
measurement, we demonstrate that these a.c. techniques are powerful in
detecting small anomalies in the elastic properties of quantum materials.
Finally, using the case of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as an example, we demonstrate how the
imaginary component of the modulus can provide additional information about the
nature of ordered phases.

</p><i>Apurba Biswas, Arnab Pal</i>
<p>We study the Mpemba effect on a non-equilibrium Markov chain that mimics the
run and tumble motion of an active particle in a discrete energy landscape. The
broken detailed balance, rendered by the activity, gives rise to a unique
anomalous relaxation in the system which is distinctly different than the
typical equilibrium systems. We observe that the activity can both suppress or
induce the Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we report an oscillatory Mpemba effect
where the relaxation trajectories, emanating from the hot and cold initial
conditions, cross each other multiple times and this occurs due to the
emergence of complex eigenvalues in the relaxation spectrum due to the
activity. Our work reveals a possible pathway for studying the Mpemba effect in
active living systems where broken detailed balance is crucial to achieve many
biological functions.

<h3>Anomalous shift in Andreev reflection from side incidence</h3>

</p><i>Runze Li, Chaoxi Cui, Ying Liu, Zhi-Ming Yu, Shengyuan A. Yang</i>
<p>Andreev reflection at a normal-superconductor interface may be accompanied
with an anomalous spatial shift. The studies so far are limited to the top
incidence configuration. Here, we investigate this effect in the side incidence
configuration, with the interface parallel to the principal axis of
superconductor. We find that the shift exhibits rich behaviors reflecting the
character of pair potential. It has two contributions: one from the
$k$-dependent phase of pair potential, and the other from the evanescent mode.
For chiral $p$-wave pairing, the pairing phase contribution is proportional to
the chirality of pairing and is independent of excitation energy, whereas the
evanescent mode contribution is independent of chirality and is nonzero only
for excitation energy below the gap. The two contributions also have opposite
parity with respect to the incident angle. For $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing,
only the evanescent mode contribution exists, and the shift exhibits suppressed
zones in incident angles, manifesting the superconducting nodes. The dependence
of the shift on other factors, such as the angle of incident plane and Fermi
surface anisotropy, are discussed.

</p><i>Jean-louis Bocquet</i>
<p>Most of the sinks able to absorb the point defects created under irradiation
exhibit a stronger elastic interaction with the interstitial defect I than with
the vacancy defect V. This bias of their elastic interaction (EB) is supposed
to automatically determine the concomitant absorption bias (AB) leading to an
elimination flux of I always larger than the flux of V. We show in this
contribution that the link between the EB and the AB is not as rigid as thought
previously. On a model system we can produce situations where this rule is in
trouble: a sink which is primarily designed to attract more I than V can
however absorb more V than I if it is located in the vicinity of another
competing sink with prevalent elastic properties. As a consequence, the
imbalance between the I and V fluxes absorbed by a given sink cannot be deduced
univocally from its elastic interaction with the two defects because it is
heavily influenced by the boundary conditions which are adopted to make the
quantitative evaluation.

<h3>Critical Behavior of Non-Hermitian Kondo effect in Pseudogap System</h3>

<p>The combination of non-Hermitian physics and strong correlation can yield
numerous novel and intriguing effects. A previous study on the non-Hermitian
Kondo model in ultra-cold atoms reports the reversion of the renormalization
group flow. In this work, We investigate the non-Hermitian Kondo effect in
system with special form of density of sates $\rho (\omega) \sim
|\omega|^{r}(r>0)$, which is called pseudogap system. We find that when
$r<1/2$, our conclusion from perturbative renormalization group theory aligns
well with previous studies on the traditional pseudogap Kondo problem. In the
case of $r$ being equal to $1/2$, a fixed point with reverse property appears
in the renormalization group flow. When $r$ is lager than $1/2$, an unstable
fixed point appears on the complex plane of the parameter space. Additionally,
we validate the conclusions around renormalization group for the $r<1/2$
interval using the large $N$ expansion method.

<h3>Nuclear spin-spin interactions in CdTe probed by zero and  ultra-low-field optically detected NMR</h3>

</p><i>V. M. Litvyak, P. Bazhin, R. André, M. Vladimirova, K. V. Kavokin</i>
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is particularly relevant for studies of
internuclear spin coupling at zero and ultra-low fields (ZULF), where spin-spin
interactions dominate over Zeeman ones. Here we report on ZULF NMR in CdTe. In
this semiconductor all magnetic isotopes have spin $I = 1/2$, so that
internuclear interactions are never overshadowed by quadrupole effects. Our
experiments rely on warm-up spectroscopy, a technique that combines optical
pumping, additional cooling via adiabatic demagnetisation, and detection of the
oscillating magnetic field-induced warm-up of the nuclear spin system via Hanle
effect. We show that NMR spectra exhibit a rich fine structure, consistent with
the low abundance of magnetic isotopes in CdTe, their zero quadrupole moments,
as well as direct and indirect interactions between them. A model assuming that
the electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by nuclear spin clusters composed of
up to 5 magnetic isotopes allows us to reproduce the shape of a major part of
the measured spectra.

<p>Lithium niobate (LNO) and lithium tantalate (LTO) see widespread use in
fundamental research and commercial technologies reaching from electronics over
classical optics to integrated quantum communication. In recent years, the
mixed crystal system lithium niobate tantalate (LNT) allows for the dedicate
engineering of material properties by combining the advantages of the two
parental materials LNO and LTO. Vibrational spectroscopies such as Raman
spectroscopy or (Fourier transform) infrared spectroscopy are vital techniques
to provide detailed insight into the material properties, which is central to
the analysis and optimization of devices. In this work, we present a joint
experimental-theoretical approach allowing to unambiguously assign the spectral
features in the LNT material family through both Raman and IR spectroscopy, as
well as to provide an in-depth explanation for the observed scattering
efficiencies based on first-principles calculations. The phononic contribution
to the static dielectric tensor is calculated from the experimental and
theoretical data using the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation and
compared with the results of the first-principles calculations. The joint
methodology can be readily expanded to other materials and serves, e.g., as the
basis for studying the role of point defects or doping.

<h3>Ferroelectric to paraelectric structural transition in LiTaO$_3$ and  LiNbO$_3$</h3>

<p>The ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition in LiTaO$_3$ and in pure
as well as Mg doped LiNbO$_3$ is investigated theoretically by atomistic
calculations in the framework of the density functional theory, as well as
experimentally by calorimetry and electrical conductivity measurements. First
principles models within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation
(SSCHA) allow to consider anharmonic effects and thus to obtain a realistic
estimate of the Curie temperature $T_C$ of both ferroelectrics. \textit{Ab
initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations performed on large supercells
confirm the Curie temperatures estimated with the SSCHA approach. Moreover,
they also suggest that the structural phase transition is a continuous process
beginning at temperatures well below $T_C$. According to AIMD, significant
ionic displacements occurr already at temperatures of about 100\,K and 300\,K
below $T_C$ in LiTaO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$, respectively. To asses whether and how
far the ionic displacements affect the materials properties, the AIMD results
are compared with measurements of the electrical conductivity and of the heat
capacity across the phase transition. Our first principles calculations
moreover show that Mg ions, a frequently employed dopant, raise the Curie
temperature in LiNbO$_3$.

<p>LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$ solid solutions are investigated from first
principles and by optical spectroscopy. The ground- and excited-state
properties of the solid solutions are modelled within density functional theory
as a function of the Ta concentration using special quasirandom structures
spanning the entire composition range between LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$.
Deviations from a Vegard behavior are predicted for the lattice parameters, the
heat capacity, the electronic bandgap, and consequently the absorption edge.
The latter is measured for crystals of different composition by low temperature
optical spectroscopy, qualitatively confirming the theoretical predictions. The
LiNb$_{0.11}$Ta$_{0.89}$O$_3$ composition is found to be a highly unusual
crystal with a permanent macroscopic electric polarization and nonetheless zero
birefringence.

<h3>A direct demonstration of bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order  topological superconductors with chiral symmetry</h3>

</p><i>Xiaoyu Zhu</i>
<p>A higher-order topological superconductor can experience topological phase
transitions driven by variations in a bulk parameter without closing the bulk
gap. This presents a challenge in establishing a direct bulk-boundary
correspondence, as conventional bulk invariants change only upon the closure of
the bulk gap. Our study of two-dimensional higher-order phases in DIII and BDI
symmetry classes, both characterized by chiral symmetry, demonstrates that
Fermi level crossings facilitate a direct connection between the bulk
Hamiltonian and Majorana zero modes at corners. These crossings, emerging as
boundary conditions vary, can be identified from the bulk Hamiltonian. For both
classes, we introduce a pair of topological invariants derived from these Fermi
level crossings to characterize the higher-order topology. Phases in which at
least one invariant assumes a nonzero value are anticipated to host Majorana
corner modes. Moreover, these invariants may change with the closure of either
bulk or edge gaps, thereby providing a clear and direct demonstration of
bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order phases. Our findings offer a
promising framework for systematically exploring higher-order topology through
boundary condition modulation.

<p>We report the magnetic structure and properties of a thiocyanate-based
honeycomb magnet [Na(OH$_2$)$_3$]Mn(NCS)$_3$ which crystallises in the unusual
low-symmetry trigonal space group $P\overline{3}$. Magnetic measurements on
powder samples show this material is an antiferromagnet (ordering temperature
($T_\mathrm{N,mag} = 18.1(6)\,$)K) and can be described by nearest neighbour
antiferromagnetic interactions $J=-11.07(4)\,$K. A method for growing
neutron-diffraction sized single crystals (\textgreater10 mm$^3$) is
demonstrated. Low temperature neutron single crystal diffraction shows that the
compound adopts the collinear antiferromagnetic structure with
$T_\mathrm{N,neut}= 18.94(7)\,$K, magnetic space group $P \bar{3}'$. Low
temperature second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements provide no evidence
of breaking of the centre of symmetry.

<h3>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in  Superconductors</h3>

<p>Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of
practical superconductors. However, the understanding of its underlying
mechanism has long been phenomenological without a clear microscopic
description. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we
studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based
superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy
vortex bound states away from EF, resulting a mini gap which effectively
lowered the energy of vortex and caused the pinning. By measuring the local
density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and
estimated the pinning force through the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The
results align with the bulk critical current measurement. We further show that
a general microscopic quantum model with considering defect-vortex interaction
can well capture our observation. It indicates the local pairing near pinned
vortex core is actually enhanced, which is beyond the traditional understanding
that non-superconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus revealed a
general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors.

<h3>Simulation of hydrogen adsorption in hierarchical silicalite: Role of  electrostatics and surface chemistry</h3>

</p><i>Siddharth Gautam, David R. Cole, Zoltán Imre Dudás, Indu Dhiman</i>
<p>Adsorption in nanoporous materials is one strategy that can be used to store
hydrogen at conditions of temperature and pressure that are economically
viable. Adsorption capacity of nanoporous materials depends on surface area
which can be enhanced by incorporating a hierarchical pore structure. We report
grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation results on the adsorption of
hydrogen in hierarchical models of silicalite that incorporate 4 nm wide
mesopores in addition to the 0.5 nm wide micropores at 298 K, using different
force fields to model hydrogen. Our results suggest that incorporating
mesopores in silicalite can enhance adsorption by at least 20% if electrostatic
interactions are not included and up to 100% otherwise. Incorporating
electrostatic interactions results in higher adsorption by close to 100% at
lower pressures for hierarchical silicalite whereas for unmodified silicalite,
it is less significant at all pressures. Hydroxylating the mesopore surface in
hierarchical silicalite results in an enhancement in adsorption at pressures
below 1 atm and suppression by up to 20 % at higher pressures. Temperature
dependence at selected pressures exhibits expected decrease in adsorption
amounts at higher temperatures. These findings can be useful in the
engineering, selection, and optimization of nanoporous materials for hydrogen
storage.

<h3>Low-temperature benchmarking of qubit control wires by primary electron  thermometry</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Elias Roos Hansen, Ferdinand Kuemmeth, Joost van der Heijden</i>
<p>Low-frequency qubit control wires require non-trivial thermal anchoring and
low-pass filtering. The resulting electron temperature serves as a quality
benchmark for these signal lines. In this technical note, we make use of a
primary electron thermometry technique, using a Coulomb blockade thermometer,
to establish the electron temperature in the millikelvin regime. The
experimental four-probe measurement setup, the data analysis, and the
measurement limitations are discussed in detail. We verify the results by also
using another electron thermometry technique, based on a
superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. Our comparison of signal lines
with QDevil's QFilter to unfiltered signal lines demonstrates that the filter
significantly reduces both the rms noise and electron temperature, which is
measured to be 22 $\pm$ 1 mK.

<p>LaCuSb$_{2}$ is a superconductor with a transition temperature of about
$T_\text{c} = 0.9$K and is a potential platform where Dirac fermions can be
experimentally observed. In this paper, we report systematic high-resolution
studies of its electronic structure using the angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) technique supported by the DFT calculation. The Fermi
surface consists of four branches, of which the two inner ones are more
3-dimensional and the theoretical calculations reproduce well the experiment.
We observe several linear dispersions forming Dirac-like structures. The nodal
lines are present in the system along ${\text{M}}$-${\text{A}}$ and
${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$ and Dirac crossings along ${\text{X}}$-${\text{R}}$
are observed by ARPES. Finally, the nesting between external Fermi surface
pockets, which corresponds to charge density wave (CDW) modulation vector is
enhanced in LaCuSb$_{2}$ as compared to LaAgSb$_{2}$, while CDW appears in the
latter system.

<h3>Facet formation in slow three-dimensional fracture</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yuri Lubomirsky, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<p>Cracks develop various surface patterns as they propagate in
three-dimensional (3D) materials. Facet formation in nominally tensile (mode-I)
fracture emerge in the slow, non-inertial regime and oftentimes takes the form
of surface steps. We show that the same phase-field framework that recently
shed basic light on dynamic (inertial) tensile fracture in 3D, also gives rise
to crack surface steps. Step formation is shown to be an intrinsically
nonlinear phenomenon that involves two essential physical ingredients:
finite-strength quenched disorder and a small, mesoscopic anti-plane shear
(mode-III) loading component (on top of the dominant tensile, mode-I loading
component). We quantify the interplay between disorder (both its strength and
spatial correlation length) and mesoscopic mode I+III mixity in controlling
step formation. Finally, we show that surface steps grow out of the
small-scale, background surface roughness and are composed of two overlapping
crack segments connected by a bridging crack, in agreement with experiments.

<p>The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the
properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of
realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional
theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$
(QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and
hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with
ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the
interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A
detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting
of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the
two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$
and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an
effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.

<p>We use high-resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and
density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure of the
charge density wave (CDW) system LaSb$_2$. This compound is among an
interesting group of materials that manifests both a CDW transition and lower
temperature superconductivity. We find the DFT calculations to be in good
agreement with our ARPES data. The Fermi surface of LaSb$_2$ consists of two
small hole pockets close to $\Gamma$ and four larger pockets near the Brillouin
zone (BZ) boundary. The overall features of the Fermi surface do not vary with
temperature. A saddle point is present at -0.19 $eV$ below the Fermi level at
$\Gamma$. Critical points in band structure have more pronounced effects on a
materials properties when they are located closer to the Fermi level, making
doped LaSb$_2$ compounds a potential interesting subject of future research.
Multiple peaks are present in the generalized, electronic susceptibility
calculations indicating the presence of possible nesting vectors. We were not
able to detect any signatures of the CDW transition at 355 K, pointing to the
subtle nature of this transition. This is unusual, given that such a high
transition temperature is expected to be associated with the presence of a
large CDW gap. This is confirmed through investigation of the Fermi surface and
through analysis of momentum distribution curves (MDC). It is possible that
changes are subtle and occur below current sensitivity of our measurements.

<h3>Negative electronic compressibility in charge islands in twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Robin J. Dolleman, Alexander Rothstein, Ammon Fischer, Lennart Klebl, Lutz Waldecker, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Dante M. Kennes, Florian Libisch, Bernd Beschoten, Christoph Stampfer</i>
<p>We report on the observation of negative electronic compressibility in
twisted bilayer graphene for Fermi energies close to insulating states. To
observe this negative compressibility, we take advantage of naturally occurring
twist angle domains that emerge during the fabrication of the samples, leading
to the formation of charge islands. We accurately measure their capacitance
using Coulomb oscillations, from which we infer the compressibility of the
electron gas. Notably, we not only observe the negative electronic
compressibility near correlated insulating states at integer filling, but also
prominently near the band insulating state at full filling, located at the
edges of both the flat- and remote bands. Furthermore, the individual twist
angle domains yield a well-defined carrier density, enabling us to quantify the
strength of electronic interactions and verify the theoretical prediction that
the inverse negative capacitance contribution is proportional to the average
distance between the charge carriers. A detailed analysis of our findings
suggests that Wigner crystallization is the most likely explanation for the
observed negative electronic compressibility.

<h3>Anomalous supercurrent and diode effect in locally perturbed topological  Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Samuele Fracassi, Simone Traverso, Niccolò Traverso Ziani, Matteo Carrega, Stefan Heun, Maura Sassetti</i>
<p>The simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry can lead to
peculiar effects in Josephson junctions, such as the anomalous Josephson effect
or supercurrent rectification, which is a dissipationless analog of the diode
effect. Due to their impact in new quantum technologies, it is important to
find robust platforms and external means to manipulate the above effects in a
controlled way. Here, we theoretically consider a quantum spin Hall-based
Josephson junction subjected to a magnetic field in the direction defined by
spin-momentum locking, and in presence of a local tip in close proximity to the
normal region. We consider different local perturbations, model normal and
magnetic tips, and study how they affect the Josephson response of the device.
In particular, we argue that magnetic tips are a useful tool that allows for
tunability of both $\phi_0$ response and supercurrent rectification.
