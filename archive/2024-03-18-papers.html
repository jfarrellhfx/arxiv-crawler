<p>In-line holographic video microscopy records a wealth of information about
the microscopic structure and dynamics of colloidal materials. Powerful
analytical techniques are available to retrieve that information when the
colloidal particles are well-separated. Large assemblies of close-packed
particles create holograms that are substantially more challenging to
interpret. We demonstrate that Rayleigh-Sommerfeld back-propagation is useful
for analyzing holograms of colloidomer chains, close-packed linear assemblies
of micrometer-scale emulsion droplets. Colloidomers are fully flexible chains
and undergo three-dimensional configurational changes under the combined
influence of random thermal forces and hydrodynamic forces. We demonstrate the
ability of holographic reconstruction to track these changes as colloidomers
sediment through water in a horizontal slit pore. Comparing holographically
measured configurational trajectories with predictions of hydrodynamic models
both validates the analytical technique for this valuable class of
self-organizing materials and also provides insights into the influence of
geometric confinement on colloidomer hydrodynamics.

<h3>Micromorphic FE$^2$ Simulation of Plastic Deformations of Foam  Structures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10532</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alexander Malik, Geralf HÃ¼tter, Martin Abendroth, Bjoern Kiefer</i>
<p>Capturing and predicting the effective mechanical properties of highly porous
cellular media still represents a significant challenge for the research
community, due to their complex structural interdependencies and known size
effects. Micromorphic theories are often applied in this context to model the
inelastic deformation behavior of foam-like structures, in particular to
incorporate such size effect into the investigation of structure-property
correlations. This raises the problems of formulating appropriate constitutive
relations for the numerous non-classical stress measures and determining the
corresponding material parameters, which are usually difficult to assess
experimentally. The present contribution therefore alternatively employs a
concurrent micromorphic multi-scale approach within the Direct FE$^2$ framework
to simulate the complex irreversible behavior of foam-like porous solids. The
predictions of Cosserat (micropolar) and a fully-micromorphic theory are
compared with conventional FE$^2$ results and direct numerical simulations
(DNS) for complex loading scenarios with elastic, elastic-plastic, and creep
deformations.

<h3>Flow of Electrically Charged Fluids Through Elastic Porous Media</h3>

</p><i>Jiashi Yang</i>
<p>We study the flow of an electrically charged fluid through an elastic and
porous medium. A three continuum model consisting of an elastic solid, a
viscous fluid, and a mobile charge continuum is used. The relevant laws of
physics are applied systematically to the constituents or the combined
continuum, leading to their continuity equations for conservation of mass or
charge, linear and angular momentum equations as well as constitutive
relations. The analysis assumes quasistatic electric fields and is for
nonmagnetizable materials. The resulting theory is nonlinear, valid for large
deformations and strong fields and can be specialized or generalized in various
ways.

<h3>Coalescence of sessile aqueous droplets laden with surfactant</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10535" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10535</a>
<br>
</p><i>S. Arbabi, P. Deuar, R. Bennacer, Z. Che, P. E. Theodorakis</i>
<p>With most of the focus to date having been on the coalescence of freely
suspended droplets, much less is known about the coalescence of sessile
droplets, especially in the case of droplets laden with surfactant. Here, we
employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this
phenomenon on substrates with different wettability. In particular, we unravel
the mass transport mechanism of surfactant during coalescence, thus explaining
the key mechanisms present in the process. Close similarities are found between
the coalescence of sessile droplets with equilibrium contact angles above
90{\deg} and that of freely suspended droplets, being practically the same when
the contact angle of the sessile droplets is above 140{\deg}. Here, the initial
contact point is an area that creates an initial contact film of surfactant
that proceeds to break into engulfed aggregates. A major change in the physics
appears below the 90{\deg} contact angle, when the initial contact point
becomes small and line-like, strongly affecting many aspects of the process and
allowing water to take part in the coalescence from the beginning. We find
growth exponents consistent with a 2/3 power law on strongly wettable
substrates but no evidence of linear growth. Overall bridge growth speed
increases with wettability for all surfactant concentrations, but the speeding
up effect becomes weaker as surfactant concentration grows, along with a
general slowdown of the coalescence compared to pure water. Concurrently, the
duration of the initial thermally limited regime increases strongly by almost
an order of magnitude for strongly wettable substrates.

<h3>Interaction between U-shaped amyloid beta fibril and semiconducting  silicon nitride monolayer</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10536" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10536</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ashkan Shekaari</i>
<p>Motivated by some recent works showing the ability of semiconducting
monolayers to disintegrate the structures of biological fibrils, we have
applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in both classical and quantum
regimes to investigate whether semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the
same ability on interaction with U-shaped amyloid beta (A$\beta$) fibril. A
number of conventional MD indicators have then been calculated including root
mean square deviation, gyration radius, per-residue root mean square
fluctuation, number of hydrogen bonds, solvent-accessible surface area, and
secondary structure of the fibril as functions of time. Results showed that the
monolayer is capable of affecting fibril's conformation. We also found that
disintegration begins from the last chain (chain E) due to the rather strong
interaction between the monolayer and the fibril residues numbered from 17 to
28 on the very chain, also engaging the next chain (chain D) as the time goes
by. The $\beta$-sheet-rich content of chain E accordingly turns into other
secondary-structure types including "turn", "coil", and "isolated bridge",
decreasing the $\beta$-sheet content of the entire fibril as well. Results
support the view that Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has a potential for destabilizing
the structure of U-shaped amyloid beta fibrils.

<h3>The role of fluid friction in streamer formation and biofilm growth</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10545</a>
<br>

<p>Bacillus subtilis biofilms were grown in laminar channel flow at wall shear
stress spanning one order of magnitude ($\tau_w = 0.068$ Pa to $\tau_w = 0.67$
Pa). We monitor, non-invasively, the evolution of the three-dimensional
distribution of biofilm over seven days using optical coherence tomography
(OCT). The obtained biofilms consist of many microcolonies where the
characteristic colony has a base structure in the form of a leaning pillar and
a streamer in the form of a thin filament that originates near the tip of the
pillar. While the shape, size and distribution of these microcolonies depend on
the imposed shear stress, the same structural features appear consistently for
all shear stress values. The formation of streamers seems to occur after the
development of a base structure, suggesting that the latter induces a curved
secondary flow that triggers the formation of the streamers. Moreover, we
observe that the biofilm volume grows approximately linearly over seven days
for all the shear stress values, with a growth rate that is inversely
proportional to the wall shear stress. We develop a simple model of
friction-limited growth, which agrees with the experimental observations. The
model provides physical insight into growth mechanisms and can be used to
develop accurate continuum models of bacterial biofilm growth.

<p>It has been recently shown that it is possible to design simple artificial
swimmers at low Reynoldsnumber that possess only one degree of freedom and,
nevertheless, can overcome Purcell's celebratedscallop theorem. One of the few
examples is given by Montino and DeSimone, Eur. Phys. J. E, vol.38, 2015, who
consider the three-sphere Swimmer of Najafi and Golestanian, replacing one
active armwith a passive elastic spring. We further generalize this idea by
increasing the number of springs andshow that it is possible to invert the
swimming direction using the frequency of the single actuatedarm.

<h3>Practical realization of chiral nonlinearity for strong topological  protection</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10590" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10590</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xinxin Guo, Lucien Jezequel, Mathieu Padlewski, HervÃ© Lissek, Pierre Delplace, Romain Fleury</i>
<p>Nonlinear topology has been much less inquired compared to its linear
counterpart. Existing advances have focused on nonlinearities of limited
magnitudes and fairly homogeneous types. As such, the realizations have rarely
been concerned with the requirements for nonlinearity. Here we explore
nonlinear topological protection through the determination of nonlinear rules
and demonstrate their relevance in real-world experiments. We take advantage of
chiral symmetry and identify the condition for its continuation in general
nonlinear environments. Applying it to one-dimensional topological lattices, we
can obtain definite evolution paths of zero-energy edge states that preserve
topologically nontrivial phases regardless of the specifics of the chiral
nonlinearities. Based on an acoustic prototype design, we theoretically,
numerically, and experimentally showcase the nonlinear topological edge states
that persist in all nonlinear degrees and directions without any frequency
shift. Our findings unveil a broad family of nonlinearities that are compatible
with topological non-triviality, establishing a solid ground for future
drilling in the emergent field of nonlinear topology.

<h3>Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations  beyond the Markov and the secular approximations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Lukas Litzba, Eric Kleinherbers, JÃ¼rgen KÃ¶nig, Ralf SchÃ¼tzhold, Nikodem Szpak</i>
<p>We consider a quantum system coupled to environment at a fixed temperature
and describe the reduced evolution of the system by means of a Redfield
equation with effective time-dependent contact temperature obeying a universal
law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state,
the effective contact temperature appears to be much higher, yet eventually it
settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a
method which includes non-Markovian effects and can be further applied to
various types of GKSL equations, beyond the secular approximation and
time-averaging methods. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss
its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.

<h3>Quantum nonlinear optics on the edge of small lattice fractional quantum  Hall fluids</h3>

</p><i>A. Nardin, D. De Bernardis, M. Rizzi, R. O. Umucalilar, L. Mazza, M. Rizzi, I. Carusotto</i>
<p>We study the quantum dynamics of the edge modes of lattice fractional quantum
Hall liquids in response to time-dependent external potentials. We show that
the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate
description even for the small lattice geometries away from the continuum limit
that are available in state-of-the-art experiments. Experimentally accessible
signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are
identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external
excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is
responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of
nonclassical states of the edge modes.

<h3>Entanglement patterns of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1)  charge</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10600" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10600</a>
<br>
</p><i>Christopher M. Langlett, Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva</i>
<p>Our current understanding of quantum chaos hinges on the random matrix
behavior (RMT) of typical states in quantum many-body systems, particularly
eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably
successful in describing `coarse' features of quantum states in chaotic
regimes, it fails to capture their `finer' features, particularly those arising
from spatial locality and symmetries. Here, we show that we can accurately
describe the behavior of eigenstate ensembles in physical systems by using RMT
ensembles with constraints that capture the key features of the physical
system. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar
U(1) charge. By constructing constrained RMT ensembles that account for two
local scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe
the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates at all lengthscales
and beyond their average behavior, analytically and numerically. When defining
the correspondence between quantum chaos and RMT, our work clarifies that RMT
ensembles must be constrained to account for all the features of the underlying
Hamiltonian, particularly spatial locality and symmetries.

<h3>A Classical Chiral Spin-Liquid from Chiral Interactions on the  Pyrochlore Lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10601" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10601</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daniel Lozano-GÃ³mez, Yasir Iqbal, Matthias Vojta</i>
<p>Classical spin-liquids are paramagnetic phases which feature nontrivial
patterns of spin correlations within their ground-state manifold whose
degeneracy scales with system size. Often they harbor fractionalized
excitations, and their low-energy fluctuations are described by emergent gauge
theories. In this work, we discuss a model composed of chiral three-body spin
interactions on the pyrochlore lattice that realizes a novel classical chiral
spin-liquid. Employing both analytical and numerical techniques, we show that
the ground-state manifold of this spin-liquid is given by a subset of the
so-called color-ice states. We demonstrate that the ground states are captured
by an effective gauge theory which possesses a divergence-free condition and an
additional chiral term that constrains the total flux of the fields through a
single tetrahedron. The divergence-free condition results in two-fold pinch
points in the spin structure factor and the identification of bionic charges as
the elementary excitations of the system. We discuss how the mobility of these
elementary charges is restricted by the additional chiral term, which in turn
suggests that these charges are fractons.

<h3>New insights into the origin of the first sharp diffraction peak in  amorphous silica from an analysis of chemical and radial ordering</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10632</a>
<br>
</p><i>Parthapratim Biswas, Devilal Dahal, Stephen R. Elliott</i>
<p>The structural origin of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in amorphous
silica is studied by analyzing chemical and radial ordering of silicon (Si) and
oxygen (O) atoms in binary amorphous networks. The study shows that the
chemical order involving Si--O and O--O pairs play a major role in the
formation of the FSDP in amorphous silica. This is supplemented by small
contributions arising from the relatively weak Si--Si correlations in the
Fourier space. A shell-by-shell analysis of the radial correlations between
Si--Si, Si--O and O--O atoms in the network reveals that the position and the
intensity of the FSDP are largely determined by atomic pair correlations
originating from the first two/three radial shells on a length scale of about
5--8 {\AA}, whereas the fine structure of the intensity curve in the vicinity
of the FSDP is perturbatively modified by atomic correlations arising from the
radial shells beyond 8 {\AA}. The study leads to a simple mathematical
relationship between the position of the radial peaks ($r_k$) in the partial
pair-correlation functions and the diffraction peaks ($Q_k$) that can be used
to obtain approximate positions of the FSDP and the principal peak. The results
are complemented by numerical calculations and an accurate semi-analytical
expression for the diffraction intensity obtained from the partial
pair-correlation functions of amorphous silica for a given radial shell.

<h3>Ion solvation in atomic baths: from snowballs to polarons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10639</a>
<br>
</p><i>Saajid Chowdhury, JesÃºs PÃ©rez-RÃ­os</i>
<p>Solvation, the result of the complicated interplay between solvent-solute and
solvent-internal interactions, is one of the most important chemical processes.
Consequently, a complete theoretical understanding of solvation seems a heroic
task. However, it is possible to elucidate fundamental solvation mechanisms by
looking into simpler systems, such as ion solvation in atomic baths. In this
work, we study ion solvation by calculating the ground state properties of a
single ion in a neutral bath from the high-density regime to the low-density
regime, finding common ground for these two, in principle, disparate regimes.
Our results indicate that a single $^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in a bath of $^{7}$Li
atoms forms a coordination complex at high densities with a coordination number
of 8, with strong electrostriction, characteristic of the snowball effect. On
the contrary, treating the atomic bath as a dilute quantum gas at low
densities, we find that the ion-atom interaction's short-range plays a
significant role in the physics of many-body bound states and polarons.
Furthermore, in this regime, we explore the role of a putative ion trap, which
drastically affects the binding mechanism of the ion and atoms from a quantum
gas. Therefore, our results give a novel insight into the universality of
ion-neutral systems in the ultracold regime and the possibilities of observing
exotic many-body effects.

<h3>Evaluation of GlassNet for physics-informed machine learning of glass  stability and glass-forming ability</h3>

<p>Glasses form the basis of many modern applications and also hold great
potential for future medical and environmental applications. However, their
structural complexity and large composition space make design and optimization
challenging for certain applications. Of particular importance for glass
processing is an estimate of a given composition's glass-forming ability (GFA).
However, there remain many open questions regarding the physical mechanisms of
glass formation, especially in oxide glasses. It is apparent that a proxy for
GFA would be highly useful in glass processing and design, but identifying such
a surrogate property has proven itself to be difficult. Here, we explore the
application of an open-source pre-trained NN model, GlassNet, that can predict
the characteristic temperatures necessary to compute glass stability (GS) and
assess the feasibility of using these physics-informed ML (PIML)-predicted GS
parameters to estimate GFA. In doing so, we track the uncertainties at each
step of the computation - from the original ML prediction errors, to the
compounding of errors during GS estimation, and finally to the final estimation
of GFA. While GlassNet exhibits reasonable accuracy on all individual
properties, we observe a large compounding of error in the combination of these
individual predictions for the prediction of GS, finding that random forest
models offer similar accuracy to GlassNet. We also breakdown the ML performance
on different glass families and find that the error in GS prediction is
correlated with the error in crystallization peak temperature prediction.
Lastly, we utilize this finding to assess the relationship between
top-performing GS parameters and GFA for two ternary glass systems: sodium
borosilicate and sodium iron phosphate glasses. We conclude that to obtain true
ML predictive capability of GFA, significantly more data needs to be collected.

<p>Due to the hybridization of charged excitons with cavity photons,
trion-polaritons (TP) in microcavity semiconductors are a promising avenue for
realizing strong polariton interactions and many-body polariton phases. We
develop a quantum field theoretical formalism to study the formation of
trion-polaritons in a microcavity semiconductor doped with itinerant electrons
within the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime. We predict a new class of
many-body states resulting from the intriguing interplay of polarons and
virtual photons in an uncharted territory of light-matter interactions and
Feshbach physics.

<p>Multiphase field models have emerged as an important computational tool for
understanding biological tissue while resolving single-cell properties. While
they have successfully reproduced many experimentally observed behaviors of
living tissue, the theoretical underpinnings have not been fully explored. We
show that a two-dimensional version of the model, which is commonly employed to
study tissue monolayers, can be derived from a three-dimensional version in the
presence of a substrate. We also show how viscous forces, which arise from
friction between different cells, can be included in the model. Finally, we
numerically simulate a tissue monolayer, and find that intercellular friction
tends to solidify the tissue.

<p>Controlling the Mott transition through strain engineering is crucial for
advancing the development and application of memristive and neuromorphic
computing devices. Yet, Mott insulators are heterogeneous due to intrinsic
phase boundaries and extrinsic defects, posing significant challenges to fully
understanding the impact of local microscopic distortions on the local Mott
transition, which demands structural characterizations at the relevant length
scale. Here, using a synchrotron-based scanning X-ray nanoprobe, we studied the
real-space structural heterogeneity during the structural phase transition in a
V2O3 thin film, with a resolution of 30 nm. Through temperature-dependent
metal-insulator phase coexistence mapping, we report a variation in the local
transition temperature of up to 7 K across the film and the presence of the
transition hysteresis at the nanoscale. Furthermore, a detailed quantitative
analysis demonstrates that the spatial heterogeneity of the transition is
closely tied to the tilting of crystallographic planes in the pure insulating
phase. We develop a structural model allowing us to interpret these tilts as
variation of the monoclinic distortion during the rhombohedral-monoclinic phase
transition. Our work highlights the impact of local heterogeneous lattice
distortions on the Mott transition and lays the groundwork for future
innovations in harnessing strain heterogeneity within Mott systems for the
next-generation computational technologies.

</p><i>Gentian Muhaxheri, Christian D. Santangelo</i>
<p>While many materials exhibit a complex, hysteretic response to external
driving, there has been a surge of interest in how the complex dynamics of
internal materials states can be understood and designed to process and store
information. We consider a system of connected rubber balloons that can be
described by a Preisach model of non-interacting hysterons under pressure
control, but for which the hysterons become coupled under volume control. We
study this system by exploring the possible transition graphs, as well as by
introducing a configuration space approach which tracks the volumes of each
balloon. Changes in the transition graphs turn out to be related to changes in
the topology of the configuration space of the balloons, providing a
particularly geometric view of how transition graphs can be designed, as well
as additional information on the existence of hidden metastable states. This
class of systems is more general than just balloons.

<h3>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized  through disorder and monitoring</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</a>
<br>
</p><i>Marcin Szyniszewski</i>
<p>In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions
due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods
capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In
this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation
of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized
particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize
the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or,
equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This
numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of
wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal
critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore,
we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered
monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process
unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law
quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free
fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by
estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored
free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle
wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition
properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.

</p><i>John C. Neu, Stephen W. Teitsworth</i>
<p>We study the fluctuational behavior of overdamped elastic filaments (e.g.,
strings or rods) driven by active matter which induces irreversibility. The
statistics of discrete normal modes are translated into the continuum of the
position representation which allows discernment of the spatial structure of
dissipation and fluctuational work done by the active forces. The mapping of
force statistics onto filament statistics leads to a generalized
fluctuation-dissipation relation which predicts the components of the
stochastic area tensor and its spatial proxy, the irreversibility field. We
illustrate the general theory with explicit results for a tensioned string
between two fixed endpoints. Plots of the stochastic area tensor components in
the discrete plane of mode pairs reveal how the active forces induce spatial
correlations of displacement along the filament. The irreversibility field
provides additional quantitative insight into the relative spatial
distributions of fluctuational work and dissipative response.

<h3>Control of quality factor of atomic force microscopy cantilever by  cavity optomechanical effect</h3>

</p><i>Noah Austin-Bingamon, Binod D.C., Yoichi Miyahara</i>
<p>Quality factor plays a fundamental role in dynamic mode atomic force
microscopy. We present a technique to modify the quality factor of an atomic
force microscopy cantilever within a Fabry-P\'erot optical interferometer. The
experimental setup uses two separate laser sources to detect and excite the
oscillation of the cantilever. While the intensity modulation of the excitation
laser drives the oscillation of the cantilever, the average intensity can be
used to modify the quality factor via optomechanical force, without changing
the fiber-cantilever cavity length. The technique enables users to optimize the
quality factor for different types of measurements without influencing the
deflection measurement sensitivity. An unexpected frequency shift was also
observed and modelled as temperature dependence of the cantilever's Young's
modulus, which was validated using finite element simulation. The model was
used to compensate for the thermal frequency shift. The simulation provided
relations between optical power, temperature, and frequency shift.

</p><i>Yuki Izumida</i>
<p>The Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) cycle is a paradigmatic model of endoreversible heat
engines, which yields the so-called CA efficiency as the efficiency at maximum
power. Due to the arbitrariness of the relationship between the steady
temperature and the time taken for the isothermal process of the CA cycle, the
constructions of the CA cycle on the thermodynamic plane are not unique. Here,
we give some of the detailed constructions of the CA cycle on the thermodynamic
plane, specifically as a temperature-volume diagram, using an ideal gas as a
working substance. It is shown that these constructions are equal to each other
in the maximum power regime in the sense that they achieve the best trade-off
between the work and the inverse cycle-time, known as the Pareto front in
multi-objective optimization problems.

<h3>Machine Learning Exchange Fields for Ab-initio Spin Dynamics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yuqiang Gao, Menno Bokdam, Paul J. Kelly</i>
<p>We add the magnetic degrees of freedom to the widely used Gaussian
Approximation Potential of machine learning (ML) and present a model that
describes the potential energy surface of a crystal based on the atomic
coordinates as well as their noncollinear magnetic moments. Assuming an
adiabatic approximation for the spin directions and magnitudes, the ML model
depends solely on spin coordinates and orientation, resulting in computational
efffciency and enabling ab initio spin dynamics. Leveraging rotational
symmetries of magnetic interactions, the ML model can incorporate various
magnetic interactions, expanding into two-body, three-body terms, etc.,
following the spirit of cluster expansion. For simplicity, we implement the ML
model with a two-body form for the exchange interaction. Comparing total
energies and local fields predicted by the model for noncollinear spin
arrangements with explicit results of constrained noncollinear density
functional calculations for bcc Fe yields excellent results, within 1 meV/spin
for the total energy. Further optimization, including three-body and other
terms, is expected to encompass diverse magnetic interactions and enhance the
model's accuracy. This will extend the model's applicability to a wide range of
materials and facilitate the machine learning ab initio spin dynamics.

</p><i>Ning Xi, Xiao Wang, Yunjing Gao, Yunfeng Jiang, Rong Yu, Jianda Wu</i>
<p>Quantum integrability emerging near a quantum critical point (QCP) is
manifested by exotic excitation spectrum that is organized by the associated
algebraic structure. A well known example is the emergent $E_8$ integrability
near the QCP of a transverse field Ising chain (TFIC), which was long predicted
theoretically and initially proposed to be realized in the
quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) quantum magnet CoNb$_2$O$_6$. However, later
measurements on the spin excitation spectrum of this material revealed a series
of satellite peaks that cannot be described by the $E_8$ Lie algebra. Motivated
by these experimental progresses, we hereby revisit the spin excitations of
CoNb$_2$O$_6$ by combining numerical calculation and analytical analysis. We
show that, as effects of strong interchain fluctuations, the spectrum of the
system near the 1D QCP is characterized by the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ Lie algebra with
robust topological soliton excitation. We further show that the $D_{8}^{(1)}$
spectrum can be realized in a broad class of interacting quantum systems. Our
results advance the exploration of integrability and manipulation of
topological excitations in quantum critical systems.

<h3>Orbital magnetic susceptibility of circular graphene nanoribbons studied  using tight-binding model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Norio Inui</i>
<p>The magnetic properties of a circular graphene nanoribbon (carbon belt) in a
magnetic field parallel to its central axis is studied using a tight-binding
model. Orbital magnetic susceptibility is calculated using an analytical
expression of the energy eigenvalues as a function of the magnetic flux density
for any size, and its temperature dependence is considered. In the absence of
electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the orbital magnetic
susceptibility diverges at absolute zero if the chemical potential is zero and
the number of atoms is a multiple of four. As the temperature increases, the
magnitude of susceptibility decreases according to the power law, whose
exponent depends on the size. In the presence of electron hopping parallel to
the magnetic field, the divergence of the susceptibility near absolute zero
disappears, and the sign changes with the transfer integral parallel to the
magnetic field and the temperature.

<p>Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created
unprecedented high capabilities in accessing and assessing complex
high-dimensional data, allowing superior efficiency in navigating vast material
configuration space in search of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities
with physically significant data to construct trained models for materials
discovery is crucial to moving this emerging field forward. Here, we present a
universal GM for crystal structure prediction (CSP) via a conditional crystal
diffusion variational autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to
allow user-defined material and physical parameters such as composition and
pressure. This model is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000
local minimum structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure
structures, along with ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project
database. We demonstrate that the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically
plausible structures with high fidelity under diverse pressure conditions
without necessitating local optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the
3,547 unseen ambient-pressure experimental structures within 800 structure
samplings, with the accuracy rate climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising
fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell. These results meet or exceed those achieved
via conventional CSP methods based on global optimization. The present findings
showcase substantial potential of GMs in the realm of CSP.

<p>Carrier transport in nanodevices plays a crucial role in determining their
functionality. In the post-Moore era, the behavior of carriers near surface or
interface domains the function of the whole devices. However, the femtosecond
dynamics and nanometer-scale movement of carriers pose challenges for imaging
their behavior. Techniques with high spatial-temporal resolution become
imperative for tracking their intricate dynamics. In this study, we employed
transient reflectivity microscopy to directly visualize the charge separation
in the atomic interface of WS2-WSe2 in-plane heterojunctions. The carriers'
drifting behavior was carefully tracked, enabling the extraction of drift
velocities of 30 nm/ps and 10.6 nm/ps for electrons and holes. Additionally,
the width of the depletion layer was determined to be 300 nm based on the
carriers' moving trajectory. This work provides essential parameters for the
potential effective utilization of these covalent in-plane heterojunctions,and
demonstrates the success of transient optical imaging in unraveling the
electrical behavior of nano devices, paving the way for a new avenue of
electro-optical analysis.

<h3>An ab-initio theory of inelastic electron tunneling spectrum of  vibrating magnetic molecules adsorbed on superconductors</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Athanasios Koliogiorgos, Richard KorytÃ¡r</i>
<p>We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a
magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first
derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent
scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting
Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which
highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We
design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the
spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model
allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting
problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an
ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of
molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the
highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best
agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states
and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions
straightforwardly.

<p>We numerically study the expansion dynamics of initially localized dipolar
bosons in a homogeneous 1D optical lattice for different initial states.
Comparison is made to interacting bosons with contact interaction. For shallow
lattices the expansion is unimodal and ballistic, while strong lattices
suppress tunneling. However for intermediate lattice depths a strong interplay
between dipolar interaction and lattice depth occurs. The expansion is found to
be bimodal, the central cloud expansion can be distinguished from the outer
halo structure. In the regime of strongly interactions dipolar bosons exhibit
two time scales, with an initial diffusion and then arrested transport in the
long time; while strongly interacting bosons in the fermionized limit exhibit
ballistic expansion. Our study highlights how different lattice depths and
initial states can be manipulated to control tunneling dynamics.

<p>In the field of 2D magnetic semiconductors, CrSBr has been the focus of
research due to its intriguing magnetic, transport and optical properties that
have potential to underpin novel devices. Here we present the evolution of the
electronic structure of CrSBr from its antiferromagnetic ground state to the
paramagnetic phase. The ground state photoemission data, obtained using a novel
method to overcome sample charging issues, is very well reproduced by
$\mathbf{QSG\hat{W}}$ calculations, a self-consistent many-body perturbative
approach that computes electronic eigenfunctions in presence of excitonic
correlations. The electronic structure is complex at $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, but
simplifies at the X points of the Brillouin zone where the non-symmorphic
lattice symmetry enforces band degeneracies. In the vicinity of these X points,
in the deeper-lying valence bands one can identify pairs of states with mainly
Br- and S- character. The energy splitting between them is understood as an
exchange splitting within the individual layers in which the spins all align,
despite the absence of a net magnetic moment in the so-called A-type
antiferromagnetic arrangement. By tracing band positions as a function of
temperature, we identify that this exchange splitting disappears above $T_N$,
alongside a significant increase in the spectral broadening in all states.

<h3>A simple and accurate method to determine fluid-crystal phase boundaries  from direct coexistence simulations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Frank Smallenburg, Giovanni Del Monte, Marjolein de Jager, Laura Filion</i>
<p>One method for computationally determining phase boundaries is to explicitly
simulate a direct coexistence between the two phases of interest. Although this
approach works very well for fluid-fluid coexistences, it is often considered
to be less useful for fluid-crystal transitions, as additional care must be
taken to prevent the simulation boundaries from imposing unwanted strains on
the crystal phase. Here, we present a simple adaptation to the direct
coexistence method that nonetheless allows us to obtain highly accurate
predictions of fluid-crystal coexistence conditions. We test our approach on
hard spheres, the screened Coulomb potential, and a 2D patchy-particle model.
In all cases, we find excellent agreement between the direct coexistence
approach and (much more cumbersome) free-energy calculation methods. Moreover,
the method is sufficiently accurate to resolve the (tiny) free-energy
difference between the face-centered cubic and hexagonally close-packed crystal
of hard spheres in the thermodynamic limit. The simplicity of this method also
ensures that it can be trivially implemented in essentially any simulation
method or package. Hence, this approach provides an excellent alternative to
free-energy based methods for the precise determination of phase boundaries.

<h3>Role of Coulomb Interaction in Valley Photogalvanic Effect</h3>

<br>
</p><i>V. M. Kovalev, A. V. Parafilo, O. V. Kibis, I. G. Savenko</i>
<p>We develop a theory of Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the
photogalvanic current of electrons in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric Dirac
materials possessing a nontrivial structure of valleys and exposed to an
external electromagnetic field. The valley photogalvanic effect occurs here due
to the trigonal warping of electrons and holes' dispersions in a given valley
of the monolayer. We study the low-frequency limit of the external field: the
field frequency is smaller than the temperature $T$, and the electron-electron
and electron-hole scattering times are much larger than the electron-impurity
scattering time. In this regime, we employ the Boltzmann transport equations
and show that electron-hole scattering dominates electron-electron scattering
in intrinsic semiconductors. Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the
valley photogalvanic current can reduce the value of the bare photogalvanic
current as these two currents flow in opposite directions.

<h3>Computationally feasible bounds for the free energy of nonequilibrium  steady states, applied to simple models of heat conduction</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Luigi Delle Site, Carsten Hartmann</i>
<p>In this paper we study computationally feasible bounds for relative free
energies between two many-particle systems. Specifically, we consider systems
out of equilibrium that do not necessarily satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation
relation, but that nevertheless admit a nonequilibrium steady state that is
reached asymptotically in the long-time limit. The bounds that we suggest are
based on the well-known Bogoliubov inequality and variants of Gibbs' and
Donsker-Varadhan variational principles. As a general paradigm, we consider
systems of oscillators coupled to heat baths at different temperatures. For
such systems, we define the free energy of the system relative to any given
reference system (that may or may not be in thermal equilibrium) in terms of
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between steady states. By employing a two-sided
Bogoliubov inequality and a mean-variance approximation of the free energy (or
cumulant generating function, we can efficiently estimate the free energy cost
needed in passing from the reference system to the system out of equilibrium
(characterised by a temperature gradient). A specific test case to validate our
bounds are harmonic oscillator chains with ends that are coupled to Langevin
thermostats at different temperatures; such a system is simple enough to allow
for analytic calculations and general enough to be used as a prototype to
estimate, e.g., heat fluxes or interface effects in a larger class of
nonequilibrium particle systems.

</p><i>Anatolii V. Mokshin, Roman V. Vlasov</i>
<p>In equilibrium and supercooled liquids, polymorphism is manifested by
thermodynamic regions defined in the phase diagram, which are predominantly of
different short- and medium-range order (local structure). It is found that on
the phase diagram of the water model, the thermodynamic region corresponding to
the equilibrium liquid phase is divided by a line of the smooth liquid-liquid
crossover. In the case of the water model, this crossover is revealed by
various local order parameters and corresponds to pressures of the order of
$3\,150 \pm 350$ atm at ambient temperature. In the vicinity of the crossover,
the dynamics of water molecules change significantly, which is reflected, in
particular, in the fact that the self-diffusion coefficient reaches its maximum
values. In addition, changes in the structure also manifest themselves in
changes in the kinetics of hydrogen bonding, which is captured by values of
such the quantities as the average lifetime of hydrogen bonding, the average
lifetimes of different local coordination numbers, and the frequencies of
changes in different local coordination numbers. An interpretation of the
hydrogen bond kinetics in terms of the free energy landscape concept in the
space of possible coordination numbers is proposed.

<p>The silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond is drawing much attention due to
its optical and spin properties, attractive for quantum information processing
and sensing. Comparatively little is known, however, about the dynamics
governing SiV charge state interconversion mainly due to challenges associated
with generating, stabilizing, and characterizing all possible charge states,
particularly at room temperature. Here, we use multi-color confocal microscopy
and density functional theory to examine photo-induced SiV recombination - from
neutral, to single-, to double-negatively charged - over a broad spectral
window in chemical-vapor-deposition diamond under ambient conditions. For the
SiV0 to SiV- transition, we find a linear growth of the photo-recombination
rate with laser power at all observed wavelengths, a hallmark of single photon
dynamics. Laser excitation of SiV-, on the other hand, yields only fractional
recombination into SiV2-, a finding we interpret in terms of a photo-activated
electron tunneling process from proximal nitrogen atoms.

<h3>Splay-bend elastic inequalities shape tactoids, toroids, umbilics, and  conic section walls in paraelectric, twist-bend, and ferroelectric nematics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Oleg D. Lavrentovich</i>
<p>Elastic constants of splay K_11, twist K_22, and bend K_33 of nematic liquid
crystals are often assumed to be equal to each other in order to simplify the
theoretical description of complex director fields. Here we present examples of
how the disparity of K_11 and K_33 produces effects that cannot be described in
a one-constant approximation. In a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal, nematic
droplets coexisting with the isotropic phase change their shape from a
simply-connected tactoid to a topologically distinct toroid as a result of
temperature or concentration variation. The transformation is caused by the
increase of the splay-to-bend ratio K_11/K_33. A phase transition from a
conventional nematic to a twist-bend nematic implies that the ratio K_11/K_33
changes from very large to very small. As a result, the defects caused by an
externally applied electric field change the deformation mode of optic axis
from bend to splay. In the paraelectric-ferroelectric nematic transition, one
finds an inverse situation: K_11/K_33 changes from small to large, which shapes
the domain walls in the spontaneous electric polarization field as conic
sections. The polarization field tends to be solenoidal, or divergence-free, a
behavior complementary to irrotational curl-free director textures of a smectic
A.

</p><i>Olivia Mallick, Muktish Acharyya</i>
<p>Three dimensional anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarized
propagating magnetic field wave has been extensively investigated by Monte
Carlo simulation with Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Both the effects
of the bilinear exchange type and the single site anisotropies are thoroughly
investigated. The time average magnetisation (over the complete cycle of the
elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave) components play the
role of dynamic order parameter. For fixed set of values of the strength of
anisotropy and the field amplitudes, the system has been found to get
dynamically ordered at a pseudocritical temperature. The pseudocritical
temperature of such dynamic nonequilibrium phase transition has been found to
depend on both the strength of anisotropy and the amplitudes of the
elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave. A comprehensive phase
diagram is represented here in the form of image plot of the pseudocritical
temperature in the plane formed by the strength of anisotropy and field
amplitudes. Interestingly, this nonequilibrium phase transition has been found
discontinuous (first order) for higher values of the field amplitude and lower
values of the anisotropy. On the other hand, the continuous (second order)
transition has been noticed for lower values of the field amplitude and higher
values of the anisotropy.

</p><i>Tusaradri Mohapatra, Colin Benjamin</i>
<p>Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of
quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle
duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which
arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current.
This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation
alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D
metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature
gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures.
Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a
metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a
metal-insulator-superconductor junction in the transparent limit. Unlike
quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias
voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher
than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of
barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct
behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to
thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate
interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev
reflection.

<p>Growth is a known driver of cellular dynamics in a range of dense aggregates
from bacterial colonies to developing tissues to tumors. Hence, universal
physical principles underlying these dynamics are of great interdisciplinary
interest. Here, we study the emergent dynamics arising from the interplay of
growth, steric repulsion and motility in a minimal agent-based model of
exponentially growing three-dimensional spheroids. Our results show that,
without cell motility, deterministic motion caused by overall volume expansion
dominates the dynamics of individual cells in the radial direction, while
growth and division lead to cellular-scale diffusive motion in the tangential
direction, whose magnitude is largely independent of expansion velocity.
Despite this small-scale diffusion, we show that cell lineages are subject to
confinement in their local environment, quenching weak cell motility. At higher
motility, we find a transient regime of tangential superdiffusivity, which is
accompanied by global mixing of cells. A quantitative analysis reveals a
diverging mixing time scale at the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics.
Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and
motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The
observations may serve as a baseline for the identification of phenomena caused
by additional biological mechanisms in experiments on tissue spheroids, which
have become a popular model system in biophysics and other fields. The mixing
dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression.

<h3>Beyond May: Complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical  systems</h3>

</p><i>Onofrio Mazzarisi, Matteo Smerlak</i>
<p>Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex
systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is
not supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological
systems are large, complex -- and, by and large, stable. In this paper, we
revisit May's argument in the light of recent developments in both ecology and
random matrix theory. Using a non-linear generalization of the Lotka-Volterra
model, we show that there are in fact two kinds of complexity-stability
relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster
with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if
cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is
stabilizing. Our result shows that May's principle that "complexity begets
instability" is not a general property of complex systems; instead, it is a
property of a subclass of weakly cross-regulated disordered systems.

<p>The quantum efficiency of AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
declines (droops) at increasing operating powers due to Auger-Meitner
recombination (AMR). Using first-principles density-functional theory, we show
that indirect AMR mediated by electron-phonon coupling and alloy disorder can
induce bulk $C$ coefficients as large as $\sim10^{-31}$ cm$^6$/s. Furthermore,
we find that the confinement of carriers by polarization fields within quantum
wells severely relaxes crystal-momentum conservation, which exacerbates the
rate of AMR over radiative recombination by an order of magnitude relative to
the bulk. This results in a striking decrease in quantum efficiency at high
power. Suppressing polarization fields and jointly increasing the well width
would greatly mitigate AMR and efficiency droop.

<p>Electrophoresis is the motion of particles relative to a surrounding fluid
driven by a uniform electric field. In conventional electrophoresis, the
electrophoretic velocity grows linearly with the applied field. Nonlinear
effects with a quadratic speed vs field dependence are gaining research
interest since an alternating current field could drive them. Here we report on
the giant nonlinearity of electrophoresis in a nematic liquid crystal in which
the speed grows with the fourth and sixth powers of the electric field. The
mechanism is attributed to the shear thinning of the nematic environment
induced by the moving colloid. The observed giant nonlinear effect dramatically
enhances the efficiency of electrophoretic transport.

<h3>Emergent Haldane Model and Photon-Valley Locking in Chiral Cavities</h3>

</p><i>Liu Yang, Qing-Dong Jiang</i>
<p>The realization of Haldane's topological graphene model in practical
materials has presented significant challenges. Here, we propose achieving this
model by embedding graphene in chiral cavities, using the asymptotically
decoupled framework detailed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153603 (2021)].
Additionally, we introduce an equilibrium strategy for achieving valley
polarization in this system with C2-symmetry breaking. Through numerical
methods, we quantify the locking of photon numbers with Bloch electrons and
calculate the topology-induced imbalance of valley photons. Furthermore, we
elucidate that topological phase transition is characterized by the sign change
of photon numbers during interband excitation. These findings underscore the
remarkable potential of utilizing cavity quantum fluctuations to engineer
electronic and photonic properties specific to valleys and topologies,
particularly within the realm of strong light-matter coupling.

<h3>Microstructural and Mechanistic Insights into the Tension-Compression  Asymmetry of Rapidly Solidified Fe-Cr Alloys: A Phase Field and Strain  Gradient Plasticity Study</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Namit Pai, Indradev Samajdar, Anirban Patra</i>
<p>Rapid solidification in Additively Manufactured (AM) metallic materials
results in the development of significant microscale internal stresses, which
are attributed to the printing induced dislocation substructures. The resulting
backstress due to the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations (GNDs) is
responsible for the observed Tension-Compression (TC) asymmetry. We propose a
combined Phase Field (PF)-Strain Gradient $J_2$ Plasticity (SGP) framework to
investigate the TC asymmetry in such microstructures. The proposed PF model is
an extension of Kobayashi's dendritic growth framework, modified to account for
the orientation-based anisotropy and multi-grain interaction effects. The SGP
model has consideration for anisotropic temperature-dependent elasticity,
dislocation strengthening, solid solution strengthening, along with GND-induced
directional backstress. This model is employed to predict the solute
segregation, dislocation substructure and backstress development during
solidification and the post-solidification anisotropic mechanical properties in
terms of the TC asymmetry of rapidly solidified Fe-Cr alloys. It is observed
that higher thermal gradients (and hence, cooling rates) lead to higher
magnitudes of solute segregation, GND density, and backstress. This also
correlates with a corresponding increase in the predicted TC asymmetry. The
results presented in this study point to the microstructural factors, such as
dislocation substructure and solute segregation, and mechanistic factors, such
as backstress, which may contribute to the development of TC asymmetry in
rapidly solidified microstructures.

<h3>Electrical reversal of the sign for magnon thermal Hall coefficient in  van der Waals bilayer antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yu-Hao Shen, Yiqun Liu, Min Luo</i>
<p>With spin-layer locking, the manipulation of spin degree of freedom via
perpendicular electric field can be realized in a typical antiferromagnetically
coupled bilayer. In analogy to the electric control of the anomalous layer Hall
effect of electron within such bilayer system, we propose here its magnon
counterpart i.e., thermal Hall effect controlled by a perpendicular electric
field. Unlike electrons, magnon is charged neutral and its transport in solids
can be driven by a thermal gradient. It also exhibits Hall response due to the
intrinsic Berry curvature of magnon, analogous to the achievement in electron
system. Taking bilayer 2H-VSe2 with both H-type stacking interlayer
antiferromagnetic coupling as a platform, we perform first-principles
calculations towards the magnetic exchange coupling parameters under applied
electric field perpendicular to the plane. Based on linear spin wave
approximation, we then fit the magnon band structures accordingly and calculate
the corresponding Berry curvature. The thermal Hall coefficient dependence on
the temperature under thermal gradient can be calculated correspondingly in
linear response regime. It is shown that electric field reversal is able to
reverse the sign of the coefficient. These findings provide a platform for the
realization of all-electric magnon spintronics.

<br>
</p><i>Niklas Friedrich, Jingcheng Li, Iago Pozo, Diego PeÃ±a, JosÃ© Ignacio Pascual</i>
<p>Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic
electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic
systems due to electron-hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a
metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the
diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule-metal interface. Here, we
present a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally
large rectification ratio (>10^5) and reversible direction. The molecular
system comprises a 7-armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single
unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic
precision on a gold substrate by on-surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates
half-populated in-gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two
segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By
suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low-temperature scanning
tunneling microscope and the substrate, we demonstrate unipolar hole transport
through the boron in-gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is
observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be
tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces
an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic
functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic
electronics.

<p>Single-atom magnetism switching is a key technique towards the ultimate data
storage density of computer hard disks and has been conceptually realized by
leveraging the spin bistability of a magnetic atom under a scanning tunnelling
microscope. However, it has rarely been applied to solid-state transistors, an
advancement that would be highly desirable for enabling various applications.
Here, we demonstrate realization of the electrically controlled Zeeman effect
in Dy@C84 single-molecule transistors, thus revealing a transition in the
magnetic moment from 3.8 {\mu}B to 5.1 {\mu}B for the ground-state GN at an
electric field strength of 3-10 MV/cm. The consequent magnetoresistance
significantly increases from 600% to 1100% at the resonant tunneling point.
Density functional theory calculations further corroborate our realization of
nonvolatile switching of single-atom magnetism, and the switching stability
emanates from an energy barrier of 92 meV for atomic relaxation. These results
highlight the potential of using endohedral metallofullerenes for
high-temperature, high-stability, high-speed, and compact single-atom magnetic
data storage.

<p>First-principle calculations were employed to analyze the effects induced by
vacancies of molybdenum (Mo) and sulfur (S) on the dielectric properties of
few-layered MoS2. We explored the combined effects of vacancies and dipole
interactions on the dielectric properties of few-layered MoS2. In the presence
of dielectric screening, we investigated uniformly distributed Mo and S
vacancies, and then considered the case of concentrated vacancies. Our results
show that the dielectric screening remarkably depends on the distribution of
vacancies owing to the polarization induced by the vacancies and on the
interlayer distances. This conclusion was validated for a wide range of
wide-gap semiconductors with different positions and distributions of
vacancies, providing an effective and reliable method for calculating and
predicting electrostatic screening of dimensionally reduced materials. We
further provided a method for engineering the dielectric constant by changing
the interlayer distance, tuning the number of vacancies and the distribution of
vacancies in few-layered van der Waals materials for their application in
nanodevices and supercapacitors.

<h3>Metal-semiconductor behavior along the line of stacking order change in  gated multilayer graphene</h3>

</p><i>WÅodzimierz JaskÃ³lski</i>
<p>We investigate gated multilayer graphene with stacking order change along the
armchair direction. We consider some layers cracked to release shear strain at
the stacking domain wall. The energy cones of graphene overlap along the
corresponding direction in the k-space, so the topological gapless states from
different valleys also overlap. However, these states strongly interact and
split due to atomic-scale defects caused by the broken layers, yielding an
effective energy gap. We find that for some gate voltages, the gap states cross
and the metallic behavior along the stacking domain wall can be restored. In
particular cases, a flat band appears at the Fermi energy. We show that for
small variations of the gate voltage the charge occupying this band oscillates
between the outer layers.

<p>In this numerical investigation, we explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of a
cold Lieb-Liniger (LL) Bose gas -- a well established integrable quantum system
in one dimension exhibiting repulsive interactions. Our study involves the
presence of a hard wall potential during the ballistic expansion of the Bose
gas from its ground state within an infinite deep box of length L0 to a final
length L. The Quantum Monte Carlo method, based on the Generalized Feynman-Kac
approach, serves as our computational tool. Given the integrability of the
Lieb-Liniger model, strongly correlated systems resist thermalization. To
capture the intricate dynamics we employ the concept of Bethe Rapidities(BRs),
a holistic function that extends beyond atomic or energy density
considerations. Our thought experiment involves a box-to-box expansion,
providing a unique opportunity for direct numerical observation of Bethe
Rapidities and the phenomenon of Dynamical Fermionization(DF). This
investigation aims to contribute insights into the behavior of strongly
correlated quantum systems during non-equilibrium processes, offering a
detailed examination of Bethe Rapidities and the dynamic evolution of
Fermionization throughout the expansion.

<h3>Merons and magnetoelectric switching in centrosymmetric spiral magnets</h3>

<p>Spiral multiferroics exhibit a strong coupling between magnetic and
ferroelectric orders, allowing cross-control. Since the seminal work of Kimura
et al. in 2003, these materials have attracted great interest galvanized by the
prospect of new high-efficiency memory devices, where magnetic (electric) bits
are switched via an external electric (magnetic) field. Nevertheless, the
mechanism underlying such a switching process - the electric field-driven
dynamics of domain walls (DWs) - is still poorly understood. We address this
problem for meron DWs, which represent one of the main DW types in spiral
multiferroics and consist of an array of meron (half-skyrmion) strings. Minimum
energy walls feature merons with alternating topological charges and move as
relativistic massive particles, with the limiting velocity set by magnon speed.
Low-energy defects in this alternating charge sequence, which appear during
domain nucleation, can lead to DWs with net topological charge. This induces a
peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, merons
translate within the wall, and the DW mobility is suppressed. The topological
charge of the wall and the meron helicity can be easily modified via an
external magnetic and electric field, respectively, offering fine control over
DW dynamics. Defects within the meron strings, analogous to Bloch points, have
hedgehog-like spin texture and are strongly pinned to the lattice. The
fascinating interplay between domain wall motion, translation of merons within
the wall, and precession of spins in the entire domains opens a new playground
for the electric manipulation of topological spin textures.

The co-presence of electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions, allows us to
estimate the spin-electric coupling. Based on spin Hamiltonian simulations of
the spectra, we identify the observed transitions and introduce the concept of
a generalized exchange qubit. This applies to a wide class of molecular spin
triangles, and includes the scalar chirality and the partial spin sum qubits as
special cases.

</p><i>Yang Liu, Xiang Yu, Luis Dorfmann</i>
<p>In this paper we present a dimensional reduction to obtain a one-dimensional
model to analyze localized necking or bulging in a residually stressed circular
cylindrical solid. The nonlinear theory of elasticity is first specialized to
obtain the equations governing the homogeneous deformation. Then, to analyze
the non-homogeneous part, we include higher order correction terms of the
axisymmetric displacement components leading to a three- dimensional form of
the total potential energy functional. Details of the reduction to the
one-dimensional form are given. We focus on a residually stressed Gent material
and use numerical methods to solve the governing equations. Two loading
conditions are considered. In the first, the residual stress is maintained
constant, while the axial stretch is used as the loading parameter. In the
second, we keep the pre-stretch constant and monotonically increase the
residual stress until bifurcation occurs. We specify initial conditions, find
the critical values for localized bifurcation and compute the change in radius
during localized necking or bulging growth. Finally, we optimize material
properties and use the one-dimensional model to simulate necking or bulging
until the Maxwell values of stretch are reached.

<h3>Non-Fermi liquid behavior of scattering rate in three-orbital Emery  model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tianzong Mao, Mi Jiang</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent findings on the $T$-linear electronic scattering rate
in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, we have investigated the three-orbital
Emery model and its temperature-dependent electronic and quasiparticle
scattering rates by adopting dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
By focusing on two characteristic site energies $\epsilon_p$ of O-2$p$ orbital
relevant to cuprates and nickelates separately, our exploration discovered
that, for $\epsilon_p=3.24$ relevant to cuprates, the scattering rate can
exhibit a linear-$T$ dependence at low temperature for a range of intermediate
densities. In contrast, for larger $\epsilon_p=6.0$ presumably relevant to
nickelates, a wide range of densities support a downturn of the scattering rate
below the temperature scale $T\sim0.1$ with possibly two consecutive nearly
linear-$T$ regimes connected via a smooth crossover around $T\sim0.1$.
Furthermore, the temperature dependent quasiparticle scattering rate
generically departs from the unity slope as predicted by the Planckian
dissipation theory. Our presented work provides valuable insights on the
extensively studied three-orbital Emery model, particularly on the quantitative
examination of non-Fermi liquid features of scattering rates.

</p><i>Xinyue Liu, Tao Li</i>
<p>Understanding the origin of electron incoherence is believed to be the first
step toward the resolution of the mysteries of the high-T$_{c}$ cuprate
superconductors. Such electron incoherence manifests itself most evidently in
the non-Drude form of the optical absorption spectrum of the system. The
spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent
in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport
property of the system. However, a theoretical study of the optical
conductivity of a strongly correlated model is a formidable task. Here we
present an exact formula for the optical conductivity of the 2D Hubbard model
from the low energy effective theory perspective. We show that the optical
conductivity in Matsubara frequency of the 2D Hubbard model can be represented
as the ensemble average of the optical conductivity of non-interacting systems
in the background of fluctuating local moment. We find that such an ensemble
average can be done exactly with a sign-problem-free Monte Carlo simulation if
we assume the widely adopted Millis-Monien-Pines spin susceptibility for the
fluctuating local moment. For thermal fluctuation of the local moment, our
formula can be used to calculate directly the optical conductivity in real
frequency which can be compared with the result of optical measurements in the
cuprate superconductors.

<p>The magnetic nature of the Kitaev candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has
been widely studied but its charge properties are less known. In the present
work, we systematically investigate the scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) on few-layer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in proximity
to graphite. While a single-layer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has a large Mott gap of
order 2 eV in spite of charge transferring to the heterointerface from
graphite, surface of 2-monolayers (MLs) and 3-MLs samples have a reduced charge
gap of order of 200 meV. Furthermore, clear signals of lattice and charge
incommensurate super-modulations are observed in 2-MLs $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with
negative sample biases outside the charge gap. The dI/dV spectra indicates that
2-MLs and 3-MLs $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ are turned from Mott insulator into charge
transfer insulator, while the charge super-modulation suggests the existence of
charge density wave induced by incommensurate dipole order.

<p>Arginine has been a mainstay in biological formulation development for

studied and debated. Here, we employed a hydrophobic polymer to decouple
hydrophobic effects from other interactions relevant to protein folding. While
existing hypotheses for the effects of arginine can generally be categorized as
either direct or indirect, our results indicate that direct and indirect
mechanisms of arginine co-exist and oppose each other. At low concentrations,
arginine was observed to stabilize hydrophobic polymer collapse via a
sidechain-dominated direct mechanism, while at high concentrations, arginine
stabilized polymer collapse via a backbone-dominated indirect mechanism. These
findings highlight the modular nature of the widely used additive arginine,
with relevance in the design of stable biological formulations.

<p>The anisotropic thermal conductivity and the phonon mean free path (mfp) in
monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ single crystals and homoepitaxial films of
several $\mu$m were determined using the 3$\omega$-method in the temperature
range from 10K-300 K. The measured effective thermal conductivity of both,
single crystal and homoepitaxial films are in the order of 20 W/(mK) at room
temperature, below 30 K it increases with a maximum of 1000 to 2000 W/(mK) and
decreases with T$^3$ below 25 K. Analysis of the phonon mfp shows a dominance
of phonon-phonon-Umklapp scattering above 80 K, below which the influence of
point-defect scattering is observed. Below 30 K the phonon mfp increases until
it is limited by the total $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ sample size. A crossover from
resistive to ballistic phonon transport is observed below 20 K and boundary
effects of the total sample size become dominant. This reveals that the
homoepitaxial film-substrate interface is highly phonon-transparent. The
resistive and ballistic phonon transport regimes in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ are
discussed corresponding to the models of Callaway and Majumdar, respectively.

<p>Graphene Hall effect magnetic field sensors hold great promise for the
development of ultra-sensitive magnetometers. Their performance is frequently
analysed using the two-channel model where electron and hole conductivities are
simply added. Unfortunately, this model is unable to capture all the features
of the sensor, particularly the bias current dependence of the magnetic field
sensitivity. Here we present an advanced model that provides an in-depth
understanding of how graphene Hall sensors operate, and demonstrate its ability
to quantitatively assess their performance. First, we report the fabrication of
sensors with different qualities of graphene, with the best devices achieving
magnetic field sensitivities as high as 5000 ohms/T, outperforming the best
silicon and narrow-gap semiconductor-based sensors. Then, we examine their
performance in detail using the proposed numerical model, which combines
Boltzmann formalism, with distinct Fermi levels for electrons and holes, and a
new method for the introduction of substrate-induced electron-hole puddles.
Importantly, the dependences of magnetic field sensitivity on bias current,
disorder, substrate and Hall bar geometry are quantitatively reproduced for the
first time. In addition, the model emphasizes that the performance of devices
with widths of the order of the charge carrier diffusion length, is
significantly affected by the bias current due to the occurrence of large and
non-symmetric carrier accumulation and depletion areas near the edges of the
Hall bar. The formation of these areas induces a transverse diffusion particle
flux capable of counterbalancing the particle flux induced by the Lorentz force
when the Hall electric field cancels out in the ambipolar regime. Finally, we
discuss how sensor performance can be enhanced by Fermi velocity engineering,
paving the way for future ultra-sensitive graphene Hall effect sensors.

<p>We present an equivariant neural network for predicting vibrational and
phonon modes of molecules and periodic crystals, respectively. These
predictions are made by evaluating the second derivative Hessian matrices of
the learned energy model that is trained with the energy and force data. Using
this method, we are able to efficiently predict phonon dispersion and the
density of states for inorganic crystal materials. For molecules, we also
derive the symmetry constraints for IR/Raman active modes by analyzing the
phonon mode irreducible representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that
using Hessian as a new type of higher-order training data improves energy
models beyond models that only use lower-order energy and force data. With this
second derivative approach, one can directly relate the energy models to the
experimental observations for the vibrational properties. This approach further
connects to a broader class of physical observables with a generalized energy
model that includes external fields.

an incompatible dynamic of 4$f$ quasiparticle and topological quasiparticle.
The former forms through screening processes, while the latter suppresses the
screening channel. By employing ab initio many-body perturbation theory
combined with dynamical mean field theory, we show that this effect prompts two
types of topological semimetals. The type-I semimetal PrPtBi exhibits a
topological quasiparticle away from the Fermi level due to the formation of a
4$f$ quasiparticle. The type-II semimetals HoPtBi and PrAlGe feature a robust
topological quasiparticle at the Fermi level, which pushes the 4$f$
quasiparticle away. Our work provides an avenue to harness semimetals'
anomalous quantum effects from topological quasiparticle to heavy-fermion
behavior by the incorporation of 4$f$ quasiparticles.

<h3>Cloaking Transition of Droplets on Lubricated Brushes</h3>

<p>We study the equilibrium properties and the wetting behavior of a simple
liquid on a polymer brush, with and without presence of lubricant by multibody
Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations. The lubricant is modelled as a
polymeric liquid consisting of short chains that are chemically identical to
the brush polymers. We investigate the behavior of the brush in terms of the
grafting density and the amount of lubricant present. Regarding the wetting
behavior, we study a sessile droplet on top of the brush. The droplet consists
of non-bonded particles that form a dense phase. Our model and choice of
parameters result in the formation of a wetting ridge and in the cloaking of
the droplet by the lubricant, i.e. the lubricant chains creep up onto the
droplet and eventually cover its surface completely. Cloaking is a phenomenon
that is observed experimentally and is of integral importance to the dynamics
of sliding droplets. We quantify the cloaking in terms of its thickness, which
increases with the amount of lubricant present. The analysis reveals a
well-defined transition point where the cloaking sets in. We propose a
thermodynamic theory to explain this behavior. In addition we investigate the
dependence of the contact angles on the size of the droplet and the possible
effect of line tension. We quantify the variation of the contact angle with the
curvature of the contact line on a lubricant free brush and find a negative
value for the line tension. Finally we investigate the effect of
cloaking/lubrication on the contact angles and the wetting ridge. We find that
lubrication and cloaking reduce the contact angles by a couple of degrees. The
effect on the wetting ridge is a reduction in the extension of the brush chains
near the three phase contact line, an effect that was also observed in
experiments of droplets on crosslinked gels.

<p>Electronic states near surface regions can be distinct from bulk states,
which are paramount in understanding various physical phenomena occurring at
surfaces and in applications in semiconductors, energy, and catalysis. Here, we
report an abnormal surface region band enhancement effect in angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5, by depositing
noble gases with fine control. In contrast to conventional surface
contamination, the intensity of surface region Sb band can be enhanced more
than three times with noble gas adsorption. In the meantime, a hole-dope effect
is observed for the enhanced surface region band, with other bands hardly
changing. The doping effect is more pronounced with heavier noble gases. We
propose that noble gas atoms selectively fill into alkali metal vacancy sites
on the surface, which improves the surface condition, boosts surface region
bands, and effectively dopes it with the Pauli repulsion mechanism. Our results
provide a novel and reversible way to improve surface conditions and tune
surface region bands by controlled surface noble gas deposition.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic Ground State, Charge Density Waves and Oxygen  Vacancies Induced Metal-Insulator Transition in Pressurized  La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11455" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11455</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xin-Wei Yi, Ying Meng, Jia-Wen Li, Zheng-Wei Liao, Jing-Yang You, Bo Gu, Gang Su</i>
<p>La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ has garnered widespread interest recently due to its
high-temperature superconductivity under pressure, accompanied by charge
density wave (CDW) ordering and metal-insulator (MI) transitions in the phase
diagram. Here, we reveal with comprehensive calculations that
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ possesses an antiferromagnetic ground state under both
low and high pressures, with the strong Fermi surface nesting contributed by
the flat band that leads to phonon softening and electronic instabilities.
Several stable CDW orders with oxygen octahedral distortions are identified,
which can trigger the MI transitions. The estimated CDW transition temperature
($\approx$120 K) at ambient pressure agrees nicely with experimental results.
In the presence of apical oxygen vacancies, we identify two different phases,
say, half distortion and full distortion phases, respectively, and their
competition can lead to a pressure-induced MI transition, in good agreement
with experimental observations. In addition, we find that the electron-phonon
coupling is too small to contribute to superconductivity. These results appear
to indicate an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism mediated by
antiferromagnetic fluctuations. A phase diagram that is consistent with the
experimental results is given. The present results not only explain the origins
of experimentally observed CDW and MI transitions, but also provide insight for
deeply understanding the properties like superconductivity, CDW and the role of
oxygen vacancies in pressurized La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.

</p><i>Logan A. Burnett, Matthew P. Clay, Yogesh K. Vohra, Cheng-Chien Chen</i>
<p>Using density functional theory (DFT) and linear response approaches, we
compute the on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ of elemental Terbium (Tb) metal in
the pressure range $\sim 0-65$ GPa. The resulting first-principles $U$ values
with experimental crystal structures enable us to examine the magnetic
properties of Tb using a self-consistent DFT+U method. The lowest-energy
magnetic states in our calculations for different high-pressure Tb phases --
including hcp, $\alpha$-Sm, and dhcp -- are found to be compatible with the
corresponding magnetic ordering vectors reported in experiments. The result
shows that the inclusion of Hubbard $U$ substantially improves the accuracy and
efficiency in modeling correlated rare-earth materials. Our study also provides
the necessary $U$ information for other quantum many-body techniques to study
Tb under extreme pressure conditions.

<p>Van der Waals encapsulation of two-dimensional materials within hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) stacks has proven to be a promising way to create
ultrahigh-performance electronic devices. However, contemporary approaches for
achieving van der Waals encapsulation, which involve artificial layer stacking
using mechanical transfer techniques, are difficult to control, prone to
contamination, and unscalable. Here, we report on the transfer-free direct
growth of high-quality graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) within h-BN stacks. The
as-grown embedded GNRs exhibit highly desirable features being ultralong (up to
0.25 mm), ultranarrow ( < 5 nm), and homochiral with zigzag edges. Our
atomistic simulations reveal that the mechanism underlying the embedded growth
involves ultralow GNR friction when sliding between AA'-stacked h-BN layers.
Using the grown structures, we demonstrate the transfer-free fabrication of
embedded GNR field-effect devices that exhibit excellent performance at room
temperature with mobilities of up to 4,600 $cm^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1}$ and on-off
ratios of up to $10^{6}$. This paves the way to the bottom-up fabrication of
high-performance electronic devices based on embedded layered materials.

<h3>Moore-Read state in Half-filled MoirÃ© Chern band from three-body  Pseudo-potential</h3>

</p><i>Lu Zhang, Xue-Yang Song</i>
<p>The moir\'e system provides a tunable platform for exploring exotic phases of
materials. This article shows the possible realization of a non-Abelian state
characterized by the Moore-Read wavefunction in a half-filled moir\'e Chern
band, exemplified by twisted $\rm MoTe_2$. This is achieved by introducing
short-range repulsive three-body interaction. Exact diagonalization is employed
to examine the spectrum in finite size. The incompressibility of the system,
the degeneracy of the ground states, and the number of low-energy states
provide compelling evidence to identify the ground state as the Moore-Read
state. We further interpolate between the three-body interaction and Coulomb
interaction to show a phase transition between the composite Fermi-liquid and
the Moore-Read state. Finally, we consider the effect of band mixing and derive
the three-body interaction using perturbation theory. By exploring the
conditions under which band mixing effects mimic short-range repulsive
three-body interaction we provide insights towards realizing non-Abelian phases
of matter in the moir\'e system.

<p>Besides the exactly solvable spin-1/2 Kitaev model, higher spin-$S$ ones, not
exactly solvable, are promising playgrounds for researches on the quantum spin
liquid as well. One of the main interests in higher spin-S cases is the
interplay between the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and spin nematics. We probe this
interplay in a spin-1 model on the honeycomb lattice with competing
bilinear-biquadratic and Kitaev interactions. Utilizing the 2D infinite
projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS), we map out the phase diagram for the
ferro-biquadratic interaction. In the phase diagram, we discover the direct
KSL--spin-nematics transitions in the vicinity of pure Kitaev limits. It has
been revealed that the ferro KSL exhibits robustness against perturbations from
ferro-quadrupolar interactions. Also, the spin-nematic phase is extended to the
parameter region near the antiferro-Kitaev limit.

<p>High-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements were
conducted on the topological insulator ZrTe5. With strong femtosecond
photoexcitation, a possible ultrafast phase transition from a weak to a strong
topological insulating phase was experimentally realized by recovering the
energy gap inversion in a time scale that was shorter than 0.15 ps. This
photoinduced transient strong topological phase can last longer than 2 ps at
the highest excitation fluence studied, and it cannot be attributed to the
photoinduced heating of electrons or modification of the conduction band
filling. Additionally, the measured unoccupied electronic states are consistent
with the first-principles calculation based on experimental crystal lattice
constants, which favor a strong topological insulating phase. These findings
provide new insights into the longstanding controversy about the strong and
weak topological properties in ZrTe5, and they suggest that many-body effects
including electron-electron interactions must be taken into account to
understand the equilibrium weak topological insulating phase in ZrTe5.

<h3>A supersymmetric quantum perspective on the explicit large deviations  for reversible Markov jump processes, with applications to pure and random  spin chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11525</a>
<br>
</p><i>Cecile Monthus</i>
<p>The large deviations at various levels that are explicit for Markov jump
processes satisfying detailed-balance are revisited in terms of the
supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonian $H$ that can be obtained from the Markov
generator via a similarity transformation. We first focus on the large
deviations at level 2 for the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ of the
configurations $C$ seen during a trajectory over the large time-window $[0,T]$
and rewrite the explicit Donsker-Varadhan rate function as the matrix element
$I^{[2]}[{\hat p}(.) ] = \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat
p}} \rangle $ involving the square-root ket $\vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $.
[The analog formula is also discussed for reversible diffusion processes as a
comparison.] We then consider the explicit rate functions at higher levels, in
particular for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $
and the empirical local activities ${\hat a}(C,C') $ characterizing the density
of jumps between two configurations $(C,C')$. Finally, the explicit rate
function for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and
of the empirical total activity ${\hat A} $ that represents the total density
of jumps of a long trajectory is written in terms of the two matrix elements $
\langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle$ and $\langle
\sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H^{off} \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $, where $H^{off}
$ represents the off-diagonal part of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$. This
general formalism is then applied to pure or random spin chains with
single-spin-flip or two-spin-flip transition rates, where the supersymmetric
Hamiltonian $H$ correspond to quantum spin chains with local interactions
involving Pauli matrices of two or three neighboring sites.

</p><i>Tim Bode, Frank K. Wilhelm</i>
<p>The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and
combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for
adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems,
the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the
calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble
size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization
problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely
interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the true
solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green-function formalism to the
spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and
the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of
the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive
numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the
instance-specific bottlenecks of the annealing protocol.

<p>Zinc telluride (ZnTe) thin films have special semiconducting characteristics
that make them very promising for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.
In this work, a novel approach for synthesizing ZnTe thin films by spin coating
technique is followed using a unique solution process with ZnTe directly
dissolving in thiol-amine co-solvents. Thin films are synthesized on glass
substrates and air annealed at 250-350 {\deg}C. The polycrystalline phase of
ZnTe is revealed through the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) is used to observe the evolution of surface
smoothness with annealing temperature. Moreover, elemental compositions of ZnTe
thin film have been determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) study.
FTIR spectroscopy reveals that ZnTe has been successfully synthesized as
confirmed by the characteristic peaks in the spectrum of 750-1000 cm-1. Optical
properties of the ZnTe thin films have been investigated using UV-vis
spectroscopy. The transmittance of the films increases with annealing
temperature. Furthermore, the optical bandgaps of the films of 2.92, 2.84, and
2.5 eV have been found at 250, 300, and 350 {\deg}C annealing temperatures,
respectively. These results suggest that controlling the annealing environment
serves as a valuable strategy for tailoring the ZnTe film properties to meet
specific application requirements. These results reveal that spin coated ZnTe
thin films are attractive ones for various applications in optoelectronic
devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.

<br>
</p><i>Garry Goldstein</i>
<p>In this work we study STM signal in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping.
We perform an extended two site Hubbard model analysis between the atom on the
tip and the atom in the sample nearest to each other. We show that in the
presence of Coulomb assisted hopping the STM signal depends on several spectral
functions thereby complicating its interpretation. Furthermore in the broadband
tip limit there are now three different competing rates for the total current
(instead of one for the usual two site Hubbard model analysis). We find an
exact (within the Fermi golden rule - that is in the limit of weak coupling
between tip and sample) an expression for the current as a function of the bias
voltage. As an example we apply our calculations to the case of free fermions
with a uniform density of states. Even in this simple case there are
non-trivial corrections where the dI/dV (the rate of change of the current with
respect to bias voltage) is not uniform as a two site (non-extended) Hubbard
model analysis would predict.

<h3>Fractional Dimensional Approach to Dielectric Tuning Effects on  Excitonic Parameters in 2D semiconductor materials</h3>

<p>We demonstrated the potential of the fractional dimensional approach to
understand exciton parameters in the exemplary atomically thin semiconductor
material, a monolayer of WS$_2$. This approach has proved to be successful in
finding the exciton binding energy and quasiparticle bandgap for the WS$_2$
monolayer in varying dielectric environments. A tuning of the quasiparticle
bandgap and binding energy by 141 meV and 188 meV, respectively, has been
achieved by varying the dielectric of the environment from 1.52 to 8.1. The
approach is justified by comparing the changes in the binding energy with the
computational results from the Quantum Electrostatic Heterostructures model.
The fractional dimension found through the excitonic Rydberg series is close to
2.8 for WS$_2$ monolayer in all different dielectric surroundings. Thus, this
approach provides a rapid and robust method for determining the binding energy
of excitons in 2D semiconductors independent of the particular dielectric
environment.

<p>MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, the first topological insulator with inherent magnetic
ordering, has attracted significant attention recently for providing a platform
to realize several exotic quantum phenomena at relatively higher temperatures.
In this work, we have carried out an exhaustive investigation of
MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ thin films using THz
time-domain spectroscopy. The extracted real THz conductivity displays a strong
IR active E$_u$ phonon absorption peak (at $\sim$1.5 THz) merged on top of the
Drude-like contributions from bulk and surface electrons. The extracted
parameters from the THz conductivity data fitted to the Drude-Fano-Lorentz
model, show significant changes in their temperature dependence around the
magnetic ordering N\'eel temperature of $\sim$ 25K, which is suggestive of the
coupling between magnetic ordering and electronic band structure. The frequency
of the E$_u$ phonon displays an anomalous blue-shift with increasing
temperatures by $\sim$ 0.1 THz ($\sim$7 %) for MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and $\sim$0.2
THz ($\sim$13 %) for Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ between 7K and 250K. The
line-shape of the E$_u$ phonon mode in Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ shows
significant Fano asymmetry compared to that of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, indicating
that Sb doping plays an important role in the Fano interference between the
phonons and the electrons, in this system. These results indicate that the
anomalous phonon behaviour seen in MBT arise mainly from positive cubic
anharmonicity induced self energy parameter, whereas both anharmonicity and the
electron phonon coupling are at play in making the relatively higher anomalous
blue shift of phonons in MBST. Our studies provide the first comprehensive
understanding of the phonon and electron dynamics of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb
doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ in the THz range using time-domain THz spectroscopy.

<p>We provide numerical evidence of the Nagaoka's theorem in the
$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard model on various cluster geometries, such as the
square, the honeycomb and the triangular lattices. In particular, by
diagonalizing several finite-size clusters, we show that for one hole away from
filling $1/N$, the itinerant ferromagnetism arises for $U$ (the positive
on-site interaction) larger than $U_c$ (the value at the transition), which
strongly depends on the coordination number $z$ and on $N$, the number of
degenerate orbitals, that we vary from $N=2$ to $N=6$ in our simulations. We
prove that $U_c$ is a non decreasing function of $N$. In addition, we find that
the lattice dependency is rooted in the kinetic energy of the hole. We find
that large coordination numbers $z$ lower the value of $U_c$. Complementary, we
explore the effect of long-range hopping on the appearance of itinerant
ferromagnetism and demonstrate that it acts as an increased coordination
number, protecting the ferromagnetic phase at small $U$. Finally, both the
effects of the presence of some additional holes and of the finite size of the
clusters are briefly discussed.

<p>Ultraviolet nanosecond laser annealing (UV-NLA) proves to be an important
technique, particularly when tightly controlled heating and melting are

studied for decades for their compatibility with silicon devices. Indeed, they
enable the manipulation of properties like strain, carrier mobilities and
bandgap. Laser melting on such type of layers, however results, up to now, in
the development of extended defects and poor control over layer morphology. In
our study, we investigate the laser melting of ~700 nm thick relaxed
silicon-germanium samples coated with SiO2 nano-arrays, achieving a precise
control of the melting process, without observing the formation of extended
defects at the interface left by the liquid front. We found the geometrical

<p>Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious
gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena.
Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic
skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by
magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the
antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of
freedom for the magnons, which are coupled with their kinetic motion via the
SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in
real space. We also demonstrate that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge
field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon
thermal Hall effect.

<h3>Tailoring topological band properties of twisted double bilayer  graphene: effects due to spin-orbit coupling</h3>

<p>Our theoretical study unfolds the topological phase transitions (within bands
of the Moir\'e super-lattice) in small angle twisted double bilayer graphene
(tDBLG) under the influence of external gate voltage and intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) for both AB-AB and AB-BA stacking configurations. Utilizing a
low-energy continuum model, we investigate the band structure and perform a
comprehensive topological characterization of the system by analysing the
direct band gap closing as well as various Chern numbers. In the absence of
SOC, the tDBLG exhibits characteristics of a valley Hall insulator. However, in
the presence of SOC, we observe a transition to a quantum spin Hall insulator
state and band topology emerges in the parameter spaces of non-topological
regime without SOC. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis between
untwisted double bilayer graphene and tDBLG to assess the impact of twisting on
the system's properties. Our findings reveal the construction of topological
phase diagrams that showcase distinct phases arising from changes in the twist
angle compared to the untwisted case. These phase diagrams provide valuable
insights into the diverse topological phases achievable in tDBLG with SOC. Our
findings contribute to the understanding of the interplay between small twist
angle, SOC, and external electric field on the topological band properties of
twisted multilayer graphene systems.

<p>Over the last two decades, non-trivial magnetic textures, especially the
magnetic skyrmion family, have been extensively explored out of fundamental
interest, and diverse possible applications. Given the possible technological
and scientific ramifications of skyrmion-texture on magnetic tunnel junction
(ST-MTJ), in this work, we present non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
based description of ST-MTJs both for N\'eel and Bloch textures, to capture the
spin/charge current across different voltages, temperatures, and sizes. We
predict the emergence of a textured spin current from the uniform layer of the
ST-MTJs, along with a radially varying, asymmetrical voltage dependence of spin
torque. We delineate the voltage-induced rotation of the spin current texture,
coupled with the appearance of helicity in spin current, particularly in the
case of N\'eel skyrmions on MTJs. We describe the TMR roll-off in ST-MTJ with
lower cross-sectional area and higher temperature based on transmission spectra
analysis. We also introduce a computationally efficient coupled spatio-eigen
framework of NEGF to address the 3D-NEGF requirement of the ST-MTJs. With
analytical underpinning, we establish the generic nature of the spatio-eigen
framework of NEGF, alleviating the sine-qua-non of the 3D-NEGF for systems that
lack transnational invariance and simultaneous eigen-basis in the transverse
directions.

<h3>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless to BCS-like superconducting transition  crossover driven by weak magnetic fields in ultra-thin NbN films</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Meenakshi Sharma, Sergio Caprara, Andrea Perali, Surinder P. Singh, Sandeep Singh, Nicola Pinto</i>
<p>The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultra-thin NbN films
is investigated in the presence of weak perpendicular magnetic fields. A jump
in the phase stiffness at the BKT transition is detected up to 5 G, while the
BKT features are smeared between 5 G and 50 G, disappearing altogether at 100
G, where conventional current-voltage behaviour is observed. Our findings
demonstrate that weak magnetic fields, insignificant in bulk systems, deeply
affect our ultra-thin system, promoting a crossover from Halperin-Nelson
fluctuations to a BCS-like state with Ginzburg-Landau fluctuations, as the
field increases. This behavior is related to field-induced free vortices that
screen the vortex-antivortex interaction and smear the BKT transition.

<h3>Layer dependent topological phases and transitions in TaRhTe$_4$: From  monolayer and bilayer to bulk</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11688" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11688</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xiao Zhang, Ning Mao, Oleg Janson, Jeroen van den Brink, Rajyavardhan Ray</i>
<p>The recently synthesized ternary quasi-2D material TaRhTe$_4$ is a bulk Weyl
semimetal with an intrinsically layered structure, which poses the question how
the topology of its electronic structure depends on layers separations.
Experimentally these separations may be changed for instance by intercalation
of the bulk, or by exfoliation to reach monolayer or few-layer structures. Here
we show that in the monolayer limit a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) state
emerges, employing density functional calculations as well as a minimal
four-orbital tight-binding model that we develop. Even for weak spin-orbit
couplings the QSHI is present, which has an interesting edge state that
features Rashba-split bands with quadratic band minima. Further we find that a
weak topological insulator (WTI) manifests in the bilayer system due to sizable
intralayer hopping, contrary to the common lore that only weak interlayer
interactions between stacked QSHIs lead to WTIs. Stacked bilayers give rise to
a phase diagram as function of the interlayer separation that comprises a Weyl
semimetal, WTI and normal insulator phases. These insights on the evolution of
topology with dimension can be transferred to the family of layered ternary
transition metal tellurides.

<h3>Spin-Orbital Ordering in Alkali Superoxides</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kohei Shibata, Makoto Naka, Harald O. Jeschke, Junya Otsuki</i>
<p>Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen
ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom.
The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed
experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based
on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for
the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model.
We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane,
while the frustration is weaker for smaller alkali ions. We solve the resulting
Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2
exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0)
and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with
recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital
degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and
interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital
ordering transition.

<h3>Memory formation in dense persistent active matter</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Elisabeth Agoritsas, Peter K. Morse</i>
<p>Protocol-dependent states in structural glasses can encode a disordered, yet
retrievable memory. While training such materials is typically done via a
global drive, such as external shear, in dense active matter the driving is
instead local and spatio-temporally correlated. Here we focus on the impact of
such spatial correlation on memory formation. We investigate the mechanical
response of a dense amorphous packing of athermal particles, subject to an
oscillatory quasistatic driving with a tunable spatial correlation, akin to the
instantaneous driving pattern in active matter. We find that the capacity to
encode memory can be rendered comparable upon a proper rescaling on the spatial
correlation, whereas the efficiency in memory formation increases with motion
cooperativity.

<h3>Coarsening of chiral domains in itinerant electron magnets: A machine  learning force field approach</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11705" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11705</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yunhao Fan, Sheng Zhang, Gia-Wei Chern</i>
<p>Frustrated itinerant magnets often exhibit complex noncollinear or
noncoplanar magnetic orders which support topological electronic structures. A
canonical example is the anomalous quantum Hall state with a chiral spin order
stabilized by electron-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. While a
long-range magnetic order cannot survive thermal fluctuations in two
dimensions, the chiral order which results from the breaking of a discrete
Ising symmetry persists even at finite temperatures. We present a scalable
machine learning (ML) framework to model the complex electron-mediated
spin-spin interactions that stabilize the chiral magnetic domains in a
triangular lattice. Large-scale dynamical simulations, enabled by the ML
force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening of chiral
domains after a thermal quench. While the chiral phase is described by a broken
$Z_2$ Ising-type symmetry, we find that the characteristic size of chiral
domains increases linearly with time, in stark contrast to the expected
Allen-Cahn domain growth law for a non-conserved Ising order parameter field.
The linear growth of the chiral domains is attributed to the orientational
anisotropy of domain boundaries. Our work also demonstrates the promising
potential of ML models for large-scale spin dynamics of itinerant magnets.

<p>We theoretically propose Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F, and
La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F compounds to be benchmark materials for bilayer nickelate
superconductivity. The stable phase of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and
La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F are found to be $I4/mmm$ without the lattice distortion
caused by octahedra rotation at ambient pressure, where as the lattice
distortion in La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F can be suppressed with relatively small
external pressure of 4 GPa. The magnetism, electronic structure and spin
susceptibilities of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are extremely close to those of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at 30 GPa. The ground state of La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F and
La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F are antiferromagnetically coupled checkerboard bilayer
with sizable magnetic moment on Ni. In addition, the inter-layer coupling
$J_{\perp}$ between Ni-bilayers in La$_2$BaNi$_2$O$_6$F or La$_2$SrNi$_2$O$_6$F
is only $\sim$ 1/10 of that in Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at 30
GPa. We argue that these compounds may serve as superconducting candidates at
ambient pressure and can be employed to testify theoretical proposals for
bilayer nickelate superconductivity.

<h3>Replica Field Theory for a Generalized Franz--Parisi Potential of  Inhomogeneous Glassy Systems: New Closure and the Associated Self-Consistent  Equation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Hiroshi Frusawa</i>
<p>On approaching the dynamical transition temperature, supercooled liquids show
heterogeneity over space and time. Static replica theory investigates the
dynamical crossover in terms of the free energy landscape (FEL). Two kinds of
static approaches have provided a self-consistent equation for determining this
crossover, similar to the mode coupling theory for glassy dynamics. One uses
the Morita-Hiroike formalism of the liquid state theory, whereas the other
relies on the density functional theory (DFT). Each of the two approaches has
advantages in terms of perturbative field theory. Here, we develop a replica
field theory that has the benefits from both formulations. We introduce the
generalized Franz-Parisi potential to formulate a correlation functional.
Considering fluctuations around an inhomogeneous density determined by the
Ramakrishnan--Yussouf DFT, we find a new closure as the stability condition of
the correlation functional. The closure leads to the self-consistent equation
involving the triplet direct correlation function. The present field theory
further helps us study the FEL beyond the mean-field approximation.

<p>Femtosecond laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast changes of the
magnetization in magnetic materials. Several microscopic mechanisms have been
proposed to explain the observations, including the transport of ultrashort
spin-polarized hot-electrons (SPHE). Such ultrafast spin currents find growing
interest because of the recent challenges in ultrafast spintronics however they
are only poorly characterized. One of the key challenges is to characterize the
spin-polarized ultrafast currents and the microscopic mechanisms behind SPHE
induced manipulation of the magnetization, especially in the case of
technologically relevant ferrimagnetic alloys. Here, we have used a combined
approach using time- and element-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and
theoretical calculations based on atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to
address the ultrafast transfer of the angular momentum from spin-polarized
currents into ferrimagnetic Fe74Gd26 films and the concomitant reduction of
sub-lattice magnetization. Our study shows that using a Co/Pt multilayer as a
polarizer in a spin-valve structure, the SPHE drives the demagnetization of the
two sub-lattices of the Fe74Gd26 film. This behaviour is explained based on two
physical mechanisms, i.e., spin transfer torque and thermal fluctuations
induced by the SPHE. We provide a quantitative description of the heat transfer
of the ultrashort SPHE pulse to the Fe74Gd26 films, as well as the degree of
spin-polarization of the SPHE current density responsible for the observed
magnetization dynamics. Our work finally characterizes the spin-polarization of
the SPHEs revealing unexpected opposite spin polarization to the Co
magnetization, explaining our experimental results.

<p>Amidst the growing importance of hydrogen in a sustainable future, it is
critical to develop coatings that can protect system components in reactive
hydrogen environments. However, the prediction of the chemical stability of
materials in hydrogen is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the
work function is a key parameter determining the reducibility (i.e.,
de-nitridation) of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) in hydrogen radicals (H*).
We demonstrate that when the work function of a TMN drops below a threshold
limit, its reduction effectively stops. This finding provides a novel
perspective for comprehending the hydrogen and transition metal compounds
interaction and allows predicting the chemical stability of hydrogen-protective
coatings.

<p>Hafnia-based ferroelectrics have become a valuable class of electronic
functional materials at the nanoscale, showing great potential for
next-generation memory and logic devices. However, more robust ferroelectric
properties and better understanding of the polarization mechanisms are
currently needed both in technology and science. Herein, we report the
properties of oxygen-deficient Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films with ultralarge remanent
polarization (Pr) of 387 uC cm-2 at room temperature (1 kHz). Structure
characterizations identify a new ferroelectric monoclinic Pc phase in these
Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films. The in-situ STEM measurements evidence polar displacements
of the oxygen atoms, which move up and down in the Pc structure under applied
DC bias fields, showing a huge displacement (1.6 A). DFT calculations optimized
the Pc structure and also predicted a large polarization. The coexistence of
the ferroelectric monoclinic (Pc) phases and orthorhombic (Pca21) is
responsible for this superior ferroelectric properties. These findings are
promising for hafnia-based ferroelectric applications in integrated
ferroelectric devices, energy harvesting and actuators, etc.

<p>Nano-protrusion (NP) on metal surface and its inevitable contamination layer
under high electric field is often considered as the primary precursor that
leads to vacuum breakdown, which plays an extremely detrimental effect for high
energy physics equipment and many other devices. Yet, the NP growth has never
been experimentally observed. Here, we conduct field emission (FE) measurements
along with in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging of an
amorphous-carbon (a-C) coated tungsten nanotip at various nanoscale vacuum gap
distances. We find that under certain conditions, the FE current-voltage (I-V)
curves switch abruptly into an enhanced-current state, implying the growth of
an NP. We then run field emission simulations, demonstrating that the temporary
enhanced-current I-V is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that a NP has
grown at the apex of the tip. This hypothesis is also confirmed by the
repeatable in-situ observation of such a nano-protrusion and its continued
growth during successive FE measurements in TEM. We tentatively attribute this
phenomenon to field-induced biased diffusion of surface a-C atoms, after
performing a finite element analysis that excludes the alternative possibility
of field-induced plastic deformation.

<p>Going beyond the bistability paradigm of the charge polarizations in
ferroelectrics is highly desired for ferroelectric memory devices toward
ultra-high density information storage. Here, we propose to build multistates
in composite ferroelectrics, which have both the intrinsic and sliding-induced
polarizations. We illustrate the concept in H-stacking bilayers of 1T''
transition-metal dichalcogenides by first-principle calculations. We find that
there is at least one order of magnitude difference in the energy barriers
between these two types polarizations, which suggests that the external
electric fields required to flipping them are significantly different. This
difference allows for a novel flipping mechanism involving layer sliding and
layer-by-layer flipping for the transforming of the polarization states. As a
result, sextuple switchable states can be achieved for the 1T'' bilayers by
properly controlling electrical field. Our study provides a new route to design
polarization multistates for developing next-generation memory devices.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructuring is a versatile methodology for
designing nanoarchitecture catalytic systems that allow for reconstruction and
modulation of interfaces and electronic structures. However, catalysts with
such structures are extremely scarce due to limited synthetic strategies. Here,
we report a highly ordered 2D Ru/Si nano-heterostructures (RSHS) by acid
etching of the LaRuSi electride. RSHS shows a superior electrocatalytic
activity for hydrogen evolution with an overpotential of 14 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in
alkaline media. Both experimental analysis and first-principles calculations
demonstrate that the electronic states of Ru can be tuned by strong
interactions of the interfacial Ru-Si, leading to an optimized hydrogen
adsorption energy. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect of Ru and Si, the
energy barrier of water dissociation is significantly reduced. The unique
nanostripe structure with abundant interfaces in RSHS will provide a paradigm
for construction of efficient catalysts with tunable electronic states and dual

<p>We investigate light-matter coupling in the cuprate superconductor
La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$Cu0$_4$ (LSCO), accomplished by adhering metamaterial
resonator arrays (MRAs) to a c-axis oriented single crystal. The resonators
couple to the Josephson Plasma Mode (JPM) which manifests as a plasma edge in
the terahertz reflectivity in the superconducting state. Terahertz reflectivity
measurements at 10K reveal a renormalization of the JPM frequency,
$\omega_{jpm}$, from 1.7 THz for the bare crystal to $\sim$1 THz with the MRAs.
With increasing temperature, the modified $\omega_{jpm}$ redshifts as expected
for decreasing superfluid density, vanishing above T$_{c}$. The modification of
the electrodynamic response arises from resonator induced screening of the
longitudinal polariton response, reminiscent of plasmon-phonon coupling in
doped semiconductors. Modeling reveals that the electrodynamic response is
fully interpretable using classical electromagnetism. Future studies will have
to contend with the large effects we observe which could obscure subtle changes
that may indicate cavity-based manipulation of superconductivity. Finally, we
note that our MRA/LSCO structure is a tunable epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
metamaterial that exhibits a nonlinear response arising from the c-axis
Josephson tunneling coupled with the local fields of the resonators.

<br>
</p><i>Hewan Zhang, Kun Ding</i>
<p>Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the
nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale
Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the
influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are
ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional
conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface
electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included.
Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or
suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal
facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which
results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the
Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between
surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical
and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium scaling of the energy density along the critical  relaxational flow after a quench of the temperature</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Haralambos Panagopoulos, Ettore Vicari</i>
<p>We study the out-of-equilibrium behavior of statistical systems along
critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches of the
temperature $T$ to the critical point $T_c$, starting from equilibrium
conditions at time $t=0$. In the case of soft quenches, i.e. when the initial
temperature $T$ is assumed sufficiently close to $T_c$ (to keep the system
within the critical regime), the critical modes develop an out-of-equilibrium
finite-size scaling (FSS) behavior in terms of the rescaled time variable
$\Theta=t/L^z$, where $t$ is the time interval after quenching, $L$ is the size
of the system, and $z$ is the dynamic exponent associated with the dynamics.
However, the realization of this picture is less clear when considering the
energy density, whose equilibrium scaling behavior (corresponding to the
starting point of the relaxational flow) is generally dominated by a
temperature-dependent regular background term or mixing with the identity
operator. These issues are investigated by numerical analyses within the
three-dimensional lattice $N$-vector models, for $N=3$ and $N=4$, which provide
examples of critical behaviors with negative values of the specific-heat
critical exponent $\alpha$, implying that also the critical behavior of the
specific heat gets hidden by the background term. The results show that, after
subtraction of its asymptotic critical value at $T_c$, the energy density
develops an asymptotic out-of-equilibrium FSS in terms of $\Theta$ as well,
whose scaling function appears singular in the small-$\Theta$ limit.

<h3>Topological edge modes and phase transition in the critical fermionic  chain with long-range interaction</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Wen-Hao Zhong, Wei-Lin Li, Yong-Chang Chen, Xue-Jia Yu</i>
<p>The long-range interaction can fundamentally alter properties in gapped
topological phases such as emergent massive edge modes. However, recent
research has shifted attention to topological nontrivial critical points or
phases, and it is natural to explore how long-range interaction influences
them. In this work, we investigate the topological behavior and phase
transition of extended Kitaev chains with long-range interactions, which can be
derived from the critical Ising model via the Jordan-Wigner transformation in
the short-range limit. Specifically, we analytically find the critical edge
modes at the critical point remain stable against long-range interaction. More
importantly, we observe these critical edge modes remain massless even when
long-range interactions become substantially strong. As a byproduct, we
numerically find that the critical behavior of the long-range model belongs to
the free Majorana fermion universality class, which is entirely different from
the long-range universality class in usual long-range spin models. Our work
could shed new light on the interplay between long-range interactions
(frustrated) and the gapless topological phases of matter.

<p>The light-mediated interaction of fermionic and bosonic excitations governs
the optoelectronic properties of condensed matter systems. In photoexcited
semiconductors, the coupling of electron-hole pairs (excitons) to coherent
optical phonons enables a modulation of the excitonic resonance that is
phase-locked to the frequency of the coupled vibrational mode. Moreover, due to
the Coulombic nature of excitons, their dynamics are sensitive to transient
changes in the screening by the photoexcited carriers. Interestingly, the
effect of photoinduced screening on the transient optical signal originating
from the exciton dynamics coupled to phonons is not yet established. By means
of broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy, we disclose how exciton-phonon
coupling manifests in either presence or absence of dynamical screening in a
layered semiconductor. Further, we unveil the promoting role of photoinduced
screening on these exciton-phonon coupled dynamics as opposed to the case in
which the unscreened exciton-exciton repulsion likely dominates the
nonequilibrium optical response. These findings set a protocol to look at an
excitonic resonance and its fundamental many-body interactions on the ultrafast
timescale, and provide new perspectives on the access to nonequilibrium coupled
dynamics.

<h3>Kelvin equation for bridging transitions</h3>

<p>We study bridging transitions between a pair of non-planar surfaces. We show
that the transition can be described using a generalized Kelvin equation by
mapping the system to a slit of finite length. The proposed equation is applied
to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the growth of the bridging film, which
occurs when the confining walls are gradually flattened. This phenomenon is
characterized by a power-law divergence with geometry-dependent critical
exponents that we determine for a wide class of walls' geometries. In
particular, for a linear-wedge model, a covariance law revealing a relation
between a geometric and Young's contact angle is presented. These predictions
are shown to be fully in line with the numerical results obtained from a
microscopic (classical) density functional theory.

<h3>Thermal Tensor Network Approach for Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Quantum  Magnets</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ning Xi, Yuan Gao, Chengchen Li, Shuang Liang, Rong Yu, Xiaoqun Wang, Wei Li</i>
<p>Low-dimensional quantum magnets, particularly those with strong spin
frustration, are characterized by their notable spin fluctuations. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) serves as a sensitive probe of low-energy fluctuations
that offers valuable insight into rich magnetic phases and emergent phenomena
in quantum magnets. Although experimentally accessible, the numerical
simulation of NMR relaxation rates, specifically the spin-lattice relaxation
rate $1/T_1$, remains a significant challenge. Analytical continuation based on
Monte Carlo calculations are hampered by the notorious negative sign for
frustrated systems, and the real-time simulations incur significant costs to
capture low-energy fluctuations. Here we propose computing the relaxation rate
using thermal tensor networks (TTNs), which provides a streamlined approach by
calculating its imaginary-time proxy. We showcase the accuracy and versatility
of our methodology by applying it to one-dimensional spin chains and
two-dimensional lattices, where we find that the critical exponents $\eta$ and
$z\nu$ can be extracted from the low-temperature scalings of the simulated
$1/T_1$ near quantum critical points. Our results also provide insights into
the low-dimensional and frustrated magnetic materials, elucidating universal
scaling behaviors in the Ising chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and revealing the
renormalized classical behaviors in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet
Ba$_8$CoNb$_6$O$_{24}$. We apply the approach to effective model of the family
of frustrated magnets AYbCh$_2$ (A = Na, K, Cs, and Ch = O, S, Se), and find
dramatic changes from spin ordered to the proposed quantum spin liquid phase.
Overall, with high reliability and accuracy, the TTN methodology offers a
systematic strategy for studying the intricate dynamics observed across a broad
spectrum of quantum magnets and related fields.

<h3>A $C^\ast$-algebraic view on the interaction of real- and reciprocal  space topology in skyrmion crystals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Pascal Prass, Fabian R. Lux, Emil Prodan, Duco van Straten, Yuriy Mokrousov</i>
<p>Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in
skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of
$C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly
coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of
Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological
complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of
the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism.
On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding
number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space
Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological
dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.

<p>The layer stacking morphology in nanocarbons is paramount for achieving new
properties and outperforming applications. Here, we demonstrate that graphene
quantum dots (GQDs) retain crystallinity and a stacking structure from CVD
graphene grown on Ni foam. Our results reveal that GQD subdomains comprise a
few-layer graphene structure in the AB -- AB and ABC -- ABC stacking
configuration. HR-TEM images along with a multiple-approach characterization
(XRD, XPS, UV-vis, AFM, and ATR-IR) exhibit 3.0 to 8.0 nm crystalline GQDs with
2-6 graphene layers thick indicating a disk-shape structure. The UV-vis
profiles show changes in color of the dispersion (from colorless to red) during
and after the electrochemistry, suggesting a systematic electrooxidation of
graphene into smaller, highly crystalline, and more complex sp2/sp3 structures.
Importantly, a control experiment performed under the same conditions but with
a graphitic rod exhibited large, polydisperse, and multilayer carbon
structures. This work demonstrates a relatively easy electrochemical synthesis
to obtain GQDs which retain the pristine and, in turn, distinctive structure of
graphene grown on Ni foam.

<h3>Exploring Dielectric Properties in Models of Amorphous Boron Nitride</h3>

</p><i>Thomas Galvani, Ali K. Hamze, Laura Caputo, Onurcan Kaya, Simon Dubois, Luigi Colombo, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Yongwoo Shin, Hyeon-Jin Shin, Jean-Christophe Charlier, Stephan Roche</i>
<p>We report a theoretical study of dielectric properties of models of amorphous
Boron Nitride, using interatomic potentials generated by machine learning. We
first perform first-principles simulations on small (about $100$ atoms in the
periodic cell) sample sizes to explore the emergence of mid-gap states and its
correlation with structural features. Next, by using a simplified tight-binding
electronic model, we analyse the dielectric functions for complex three
dimensional models (containing about $10.000$ atoms) embedding varying
concentrations of ${\rm sp^{1}, sp^{2}}$ and ${\rm sp^3}$ bonds between B and N
atoms. Within the limits of these methodologies, the resulting value of the
zero-frequency dielectric constant is shown to be influenced by the population
density of such mid-gap states and their localization characteristics. We
observe nontrivial correlations between the structure-induced electronic
fluctuations and the resulting dielectric constant values. Our findings are
however just a first step in the quest of accessing fully accurate dielectric
properties of as-grown amorphous BN of relevance for interconnect technologies
and beyond.

<h3>Langevin equation in heterogeneous landscapes: how to choose the  interpretation</h3>

<p>The Langevin equation is a common tool to model diffusion at a
single-particle level. In non-homogeneous environments, such as aqueous
two-phase systems or biological condensates with different diffusion
coefficients in different phases, the solution to a Langevin equation is not
unique unless the interpretation of stochastic integrals involved is selected.
We analyze the diffusion of particles in such systems and evaluate the mean,
the mean square displacement, and the distribution of particles, as well as the
variance of the time-averaged mean-squared displacements. Our analytical
results provide a method to choose the interpretation parameter from single
particle tracking experiments.

<h3>Recovering the activity parameters of an active fluid confined in a  sphere</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Cristian Villalobos, MarÃ­a Luisa Cordero, Eric ClÃ©ment, Rodrigo Soto</i>
<p>The properties of an active fluid, for example, a bacterial bath or a
collection of microtubules and molecular motors, can be accessed through the
dynamics of passive particle probes. Here, in the perspective of analyzing
experimental situations of confinement in droplets, we consider the kinematics
of a negatively buoyant probe particle in an active fluid, both confined within
a spherical domain. The active bath generates a fluctuating flow that pushes
the particle with a velocity that is modeled as a colored stochastic noise,
characterized by two parameters, the intensity and memory time of the active
flow. When the particle departs a little from the bottom of the spherical
domain, the configuration is well approximated by a particle in a
two-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to the colored noise, in which case an
analytical solution exists, which is the base for quantitative analysis. We
numerically simulate the dynamics of the particle and use the planar,
two-dimensional mean square displacement to recover the activity parameters of
the bath. This approach yields satisfactory results as long as the particle
remains relatively confined, that is, as long as the intensity of the colored
noise remains low.

<p>Half-metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as
important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications.
Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them
into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition
metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and
we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature
magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored
experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong
in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our
study establishes Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ as a platform material, viable for
ferromagnetic nanoscale devices and magnetic-memory architectures.

<p>Co-based materials have recently been explored due to potential to realise
complex bond-dependent anisotropic magnetism. Prominent examples include
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$, Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, and CoX$_2$
(X = Cl, Br, I). In order to provide insight into the magnetic interactions in
these compounds, we make a comparative analysis of their local crystal electric
field excitations spectra via Raman scattering measurements. Combining these
measurements with theoretical analysis confirms the validity of $j_{\rm eff} =
1/2$ single-ion ground states for all compounds, and provides accurate
experimental estimates of the local crystal distortions, which play a prominent
role in the magnetic couplings between spin-orbital coupled Co moments.

<h3>Enhanced Electron Extraction in Co-Doped TiO2 Quantified by  Drift-Diffusion Simulation for Stable CsPbI3 Solar Cells</h3>

<p>Solar cells based on inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 are promising candidates to
resolve the challenge of operational stability in the field of perovskite
photovoltaics. For stable operation, however, it is crucial to thoroughly
understand the extractive and recombinative processes occurring at the
interfaces of perovskite and the charge-selective layers. In this study, we
focus on the electronic properties of (doped) TiO2 as an electron-selective
contact. We show via KPFM that co-doping of TiO2 with Nb(V) and Sn(IV) reduces
the materials work function by 270 meV, giving it stronger n-type
characteristics compared to Nb(V) mono-doped TiO2. The altered electronic
alignment with CsPbI3 translates to enhanced electron extraction, as
demonstrated with ssPL, trPL and trSPV in triad. Importantly, we extract
crucial parameters, such as the concentration of extracted electrons and the
interface hole recombination velocity, from the SPV transients via 2D
drift-diffusion simulations. When implementing the co-doped TiO2 into full
n-i-p solar cells, the operational stability is enhanced to 32000 h of
projected TS80 lifetime. This study provides fundamental understanding of
interfacial charge extraction and its correlation with operational stability of
perovskite solar cells, which can be transferred to other charge-selective
contacts.

<h3>Suppression of the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability due to  massive vortex cores, friction and confinement</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11987" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11987</a>
<br>
</p><i>Matteo Caldara, Andrea Richaud, Massimo Capone, Pietro Massignan</i>
<p>We characterize the dynamical instability responsible for the breakdown of
regular rows and necklaces of quantized vortices that appear at the interface
between two superfluids in relative motion. Making use of a generalized
point-vortex model, we identify several mechanisms leading to the suppression
of this instability. They include a non-zero mass of the vortex cores,
dissipative processes resulting from the interaction between the vortices and
the excitations of the superfluid, and the proximity of the vortex array to the
sample boundaries. We show that massive vortex cores not only have a mitigating
effect on the dynamical instability, but also change the associated scaling law
and affect the direction along which it develops. The predictions of our
massive and dissipative point-vortex model are eventually compared against
recent experimental measurements of the maximum instability growth rate
relevant to vortex necklaces in a cold-atom platform.

<h3>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12018</a>
<br>
</p><i>Julius T. Gohsrich, Jacob Fauman, Flore K. Kunst</i>
<p>Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where
matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of
coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focusses on studying
$N$th-order EPs in $N\leq4$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other
hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with
systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this letter, we
introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of
arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized
version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The
EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated
eigenstates are localized on a subset of sites and are exhibiting the NH skin
effect. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the
hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.
