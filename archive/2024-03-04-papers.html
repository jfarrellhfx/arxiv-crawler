<h3>The first law of thermodynamics in hydrodynamic steady and unsteady  flows</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00463</a>
<br>
</p><i>Konrad Giżyński, Karol Makuch, Jan Paczesny, Paweł Żuk, Anna Maciołek, Robert Hołyst</i>
<p>We studied planar compressible flows of ideal gas as models of a
non-equilibrium thermodynamic system. We demonstrate that internal energy
$U(S^{*},V,N)$ of such systems in stationary and non-stationary states is the
function of only three parameters of state, i.e. non-equilibrium entropy
$S^{*}$, volume $V$ and number of particles $N$ in the system. Upon transition
between different states, the system obeys the first thermodynamic law, i.e.
$dU=T^{*}dS^{*}-p^{*}dV+{\mu}^{*}dN$, where $U=3/2 NRT^{*}$ and
$p^{*}V=NRT^{*}$. Placing a cylinder inside the channel, we find that U depends
on the location of the cylinder $y_{c}$ only via the parameters of state, i.e.
$U(S^{*}(y_{c}),V,N(y_{c}))$ at V=const. Moreover, when the flow around the
cylinder becomes unstable, and velocity, pressure, and density start to
oscillate as a function of time, t, U depends on t only via the parameters of
state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(t),V,N(t))$ for V=const. These examples show that such a
form of internal energy is robust and does not depend on the particular
boundary conditions even in the unsteady flow.

<h3>Marginal Fermi liquid behavior at the onset of $\boldsymbol{2k_F}$  density wave order in two-dimensional metals with flat hot spots</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00007</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lukas Debbeler, Walter Metzner</i>
<p>We analyze quantum fluctuation effects at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$
charge- or spin-density wave order in two-dimensional metals, for a model where
the ordering wave vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$ connects a single pair of hot spots
on the Fermi surface with a vanishing Fermi surface curvature. The tangential
momentum dependence of the bare dispersion near the hot spots is proportional
to $|k_t|^\alpha$ with $\alpha > 2$. We first compute the order parameter
susceptibility and the fermion self-energy in random phase approximation (RPA).
Logarithmic divergences are subsequently treated by a renormalization group
analysis. The coupling between the order parameter fluctuations and the
fermions vanishes logarithmically in the low-energy limit. As a consequence,
the logarithmic divergences found in RPA do not sum up to anomalous power laws.
Instead, only logarithmic corrections to Fermi liquid behavior are obtained. In
particular, the quasiparticle weight and the Fermi velocity vanish
logarithmically at the hot spots.

<h3>Strong Correlations at Oxide Interfaces: What is Hidden in a Plane View?</h3>

<p>A prime goal for this lecture is to provide a reader with a reasonably
self-sufficient answer to the question of what interesting effects can happen
if you join two dissimilar materials with correlated carriers to construct a
sandwich with the interface across those layers. Through the lens of physical
phenomena, we will delve into the design ideas that lead to the creation of new
synthetic quantum materials with properties primarily governed by the

<h3>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to  bulk observables</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</a>
<br>
</p><i>Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec</i>
<p>We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional
non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production
scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The
result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the
thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and
overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our
work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk
experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since
microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only
averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is
practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments
where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results
may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious
directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in
time-resolved X-ray scattering.

<h3>Long-lived Topological Flatband Excitons in Semiconductor Moiré  Heterostructures: a Bosonic Kane-Mele Model Platform</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00052</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ming Xie, Mohammad Hafezi, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>Moir\'e superlattices based on two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a highly versatile and fruitful platform
for exploring correlated topological electronic phases. One of the most
remarkable examples is the recently discovered fractional quantum anomalous
Hall effect (FQAHE) under zero magnetic field. Here we propose a minimal
structure that hosts long-lived excitons -- a ubiquitous bosonic excitation in
TMD semiconductors -- with narrow topological bosonic bands. The nontrivial
exciton topology originates from hybridization of moir\'e interlayer excitons,
and is tunable by controlling twist angle and electric field. At small twist
angle, the lowest exciton bands are isolated from higher energy bands, and
provides a solid-state realization of bosonic Kane-Mele model with topological
flatbands, which could potentially support the bosonic version of FQAHE.

<h3>Crystalline axion electrodynamics in charge-ordered Dirac semimetals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00055" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00055</a>
<br>
</p><i>Julian May-Mann, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Lei Gioia, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<p>Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can be driven into an insulating state by
coupling to a charge density wave (CDW) order. Here, we consider the quantized
crystalline responses of such charge-ordered Dirac semimetals, which we dub
Dirac-CDW insulators, in which charge is bound to disclination defects of the
lattice. Using analytic and numeric methods we show the following. First, when
the CDW is lattice-commensurate, disclination-line defects of the lattice have
a quantized charge per length. Second, when the CDW is inversion-symmetric,
disclinations of the lattice have a quantized electric polarization. Third,
when the CDW is lattice-commensurate and inversion-symmetric, disclinations are
characterized by a "disclination filling anomaly" -- a quantized difference in
the total charge bound to disclination-lines of Dirac-CDW with open and
periodic boundaries. We construct an effective response theory that captures
the topological responses of the Dirac-CDW insulators in terms of a total
derivative term, denoted the $R\wedge F$ term. The $R\wedge F$ term describes
the crystalline analog of the axion electrodynamics that are found in Weyl
semimetal-CDW insulators. We also use the crystalline responses and
corresponding response theories to classify the strongly correlated topological
phases of three-dimensions Dirac-semimetals.

<h3>Non-Abelian fractionalization in topological minibands</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00059</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aidan P. Reddy, Nisarga Paul, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Liang Fu</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states
in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases
in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern
band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional
semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence
of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using
many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature
variations in momentum space%and real-space emergent magnetic field, , the
non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second
miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian
fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on
the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we discuss the
prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state at filling factor $\nu=3/2$ in
twisted semiconductor bilayers.

<h3>Strong non-linear response of strange metals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00062" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00062</a>
<br>
</p><i>Serhii Kryhin, Subir Sachdev, Pavel A. Volkov</i>
<p>Understanding the behavior and properties of strange metals remains an
outstanding challenge in correlated electron systems. Recently, a model of a
quantum critical metal with spatially random couplings to a critical boson
(Patel et al., Science 381, 790 (2023)) has been shown to capture the
linear-in-$T$ resistivity down to zero temperature ($T$) - one of the universal
experimental signatures of strange metals. In our work we explore the
non-linear transport properties of such a model of strange metal. Uniting the
large-$N$ and Keldysh field theory formalisms, we derive a set of kinetic
equations for the strange metal and use it to compute nonlinear conductivity.
We find that the third-order conductivity is enhanced by a factor of
${T_F}/{T}$ in comparison to a Fermi liquid, resulting in a strong temperature
dependence. This behavior is shown to arise from the strong, non-analytic
energy dependence of scattering rate and self-energies for electrons. We
highlight the role of energy relaxation and electron-boson drag for the
nonlinear responses. Finally, we discuss the potential for nonanalytic
nonlinear electric field ($\vec E$) response arising at low temperatures. Our
work demonstrates the characteristic features of strange metals in nonlinear
transport, that may allow to gain more insight about their behavior in future
experiments.

<h3>Quantum transport properties of the topological Dirac Semimetal  $α$-Sn</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00083</a>
<br>
</p><i>Md Shahin Alam, Alexandr Kazakov, Mujeeb Ahmad, Rajibul Islam, Fei Xue, Marcin Matusiak</i>
<p>We report measurements of the electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and
thermoelectric power (S) in a thin film of strained single-crystalline
$\alpha$-Sn grown by molecular beam epitaxy on an insulating substrate. The
temperature (T) dependence of the resistivity of $\alpha$-Sn can be divided
into two regions:below T* $\approx$ 135 K $\rho$(T) shows a metallic-like
behaviour, while above this temperature an increasing contribution from
thermally excited holes to electrical transport is observed. However, it is
still dominated by highly mobile electrons, resulting in a negative sign of the
Seebeck coefficient above T = 47 K. In the low temperature limit, a small
positive S likely reflects the persistent contribution from low-mobility holes
or the positive phonon-drag thermopower. In the presence of the magnetic field
(B) applied along an electric field or thermal gradient, we note a negative
magnetoresistance or a negative slope of S(B), respectively. The theoretical
prediction for the former (calculated using density functional theory) agrees
well with the experiment. However, these characteristics quickly disappear when
the magnetic field is deviated from an orientation parallel to the electrical
field or the thermal gradient. We indicate that the behaviour of the electrical
resistivity and thermoelectric power can be explained in terms of the chiral
current arising from the topologically non-trivial electronic structure of
$\alpha$-Sn. Its decay at high temperature is a consequence of the decreasing
ratio between the intervalley Weyl relaxation time to the Drude scattering
time.

<h3>Tuning chemical short-range order for stainless behavior at reduced  chromium concentrations in multi-principal element alloys</h3>

<p>Single-phase multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) hold promise for improved
mechanical properties as a result of multiple operative deformation modes.
However, the use of many of these alloys in structural applications is limited
as a consequence of their poor aqueous corrosion resistance. Here we introduce
a new approach for significantly improving the passivation behavior of alloys
by tuning the chemical short-range order (CSRO) parameter. We show that the
addition of only 0.03 to 0.06 mole fraction of Al to a (FeCoNi)0.9Cr0.1 alloy
changed both the magnitude and sign of the Cr-Cr CSRO parameter resulting in
passivation behavior similar to 304L stainless steel containing twice the
amount of Cr. Our analysis is based on comparing electrochemical measures of
the kinetics of passive film formation with CSRO characterizations using
time-of-flight neutron scattering, cluster expansion methods, density
functional theory and Monte Carlo techniques. Our findings are interpreted
within the framework of a recently proposed percolation theory of passivation
that examines how selective dissolution of the non-passivating alloy components
and CSRO results in excellent passive films at reduced levels of the
passivating component.

<h3>Hamiltonian reconstruction via ringdown dynamics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00102</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vincent Dumont, Markus Bestler, Letizia Catalini, Gabriel Margiani, Oded Zilberberg, Alexander Eichler</i>
<p>Many experimental techniques aim at determining the Hamiltonian of a given
system. The Hamiltonian describes the system's evolution in the absence of
dissipation, and is often central to control or interpret an experiment. Here,
we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for
Hamiltonian reconstruction from measurements over a large area of phase space,
overcoming the main limitation of previous techniques. A crucial ingredient for
our method is the presence of dissipation, which enables sampling of the
Hamiltonian through ringdown-type measurements. We apply the method to a
driven-dissipative system -- a parametric oscillator -- observed in a rotating
frame, and reconstruct the (quasi-)Hamiltonian of the system. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our method provides direct experimental access to the
so-called symplectic norm of the stationary states of the system, which is tied
to the particle- or hole-like nature of excitations of these states. In this
way, we establish a method to unveil qualitative differences between the
fluctuations around stabilized minima and maxima of the nonlinear
out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Our method constitutes a versatile
approach to characterize a wide class of driven-dissipative systems.

<h3>A moment tensor potential for lattice thermal conductivity calculations  of alpha and beta phases of Ga2O3</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00113" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00113</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nikita Rybin, Alexander Shapeev</i>
<p>Calculations of heat transport in crystalline materials have recently become
mainstream, thanks to machine-learned interatomic potentials that allow for
significant computational cost reductions while maintaining the accuracy of
first-principles calculations. Moment tensor potentials (MTP) are among the
most efficient and accurate models in this regard. In this study, we
demonstrate the application of MTP to the calculation of the lattice thermal
conductivity of alpha and beta Ga2O3. Although MTP is commonly employed for
lattice thermal conductivity calculations, the advantages of applying the
active learning methodology for potential generation is often overlooked. Here,
we emphasize its importance and illustrate how it enables the generation of a
robust and accurate interatomic potential while maintaining a moderate-sized
training dataset.

<h3>Quasi-superfluid and Quasi-Mott phases of strongly interacting bosons in  shallow optical lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00124</a>
<br>
</p><i>Subhrajyoti Roy, Rhombik Roy, Arnaldo Gammal, Barnali Chakrabarti, Budhaditya Chatterjee</i>
<p>We explore the ground states of strongly interacting bosons in the
vanishingly small and weak lattices using the multiconfiguration time-dependent
Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) which calculate numerically exact many-body
wave function. Two new many-body phases: fragmented or quasi superfluid (QSF)
and incomplete fragmented Mott or quasi Mott insulator (QMI) are emerged due to
the strong interplay between interaction and lattice depth. Fragmentation is
utilized as a figure of merit to distinguish these two new phases. We utilize
the eigenvalues of the reduced one-body density matrix and define an order
parameter that characterizes the pathway from a very weak lattice to a deep
lattice. We provide a detailed investigation through the measures of one- and
two-body correlations and information entropy. We find that the structures in
one- and two-body coherence are good markers to understand the gradual built-up
of intra-well correlation and decay of inter-well correlation with increase in
lattice depth.

<h3>Searching for magnetically hard monoborides (and finding a few): A  first-principles investigation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Justyn Snarski-Adamski, Mirosław Werwiński</i>
<p>New hard magnetic materials with zero or low rare earth content are in demand
due to the high prices of the rare earth metals. Among the candidates for such
materials, we consider MnB, FeB and their alloys, because previous experiments
suggest that FeB has a relatively high magnetic hardness of about 0.83 at room
temperature. Using first-principles calculations, we examine the full range of
alloys from CrB, through MnB, FeB, to CoB. Furthrmore, we consider alloys of
MnB and FeB with substitutions of 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. For
the above ninety compositions, we determine magnetic moment, magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy and magnetic hardness. For (Fe-Co)B alloys, the calculated
values of magnetic hardness exceed five, which is an exceptionally high. While
these values are inflated by the virtual crystal approximation used, we still
expect actual magnetic hardnesses well above unity. Furthermore, we classify
considered MnB alloys substituted with transition metals as magnetically soft
or semi-hard and FeB alloys with Sc, Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta or W as
magnetically hard (with magnetic hardness exceeding unity).

<h3>Solid-Liquid Transition in a Skyrmion Matter</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Dmitry A. Garanin, Eugene M. Chudnovsky</i>
<p>We report Monte-Carlo studies of the orientational order and melting of a 2D
skyrmion lattice containing more than one million spins. Two models have been
investigated, a microscopic model of lattice spins with Dzyaloshinskii-Moryia
interaction that possesses skyrmions, and the model in which skyrmions are
treated as point particles with repulsive interaction derived from a spin
model. They produce similar results. The skyrmion lattice exhibits a sharp
one-step transition between solid and liquid phases on temperature and the
magnetic field. This solid-liquid transition is characterized by the kink in
the magnetization. The field-temperature phase diagram is computed. We show
that the application of the field gradient to a 2D system of skyrmions produces
a solid-liquid interface that must be possible to observe in experiments.

<h3>Pair density wave order in multiband systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Nicole Sabina Ticea, Srinivas Raghu, Yi-Ming Wu</i>
<p>An indispensable ingredient for pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity is
the presence of an attractive pairing interaction at finite momentum. Here, we
show how this condition can be met with straightforward electron-density
interactions in multiband systems. The electron-density interaction, when
projected to the band basis, acquires form factors with nontrivial momentum
dependence and thereby exhibits a potential tendency to a finite-momentum
pairing instability. By applying a mean-field analysis to two simple multiband
models, the checkerboard lattice and three-band Hubbard model, we find that PDW
order can indeed become the leading instability if a strong nearest-neighbour
attraction is present. Moreover, the condition for the transition from a
uniform superconductor to a PDW superconductor is shown via a simple quantum
geometric argument.

<h3>Current-induced sliding motion in a helimagnet MnAu$_2$</h3>

</p><i>Yuta Kimoto, Hidetoshi Masuda, Takeshi Seki, Yoichi Nii, Yoshinori Onose</i>
<p>We have found a signature of current-induced sliding motion in a helimagnet
MnAu$_2$ thin film. In the helimagnetic state with a uniform chirality,
differential resistivity shows an abrupt change at a threshold bias current.
Judging from the similarity to the canonical charge/spin density wave systems,
we have ascribed the abrupt change to the sliding motion of the helimagnetic
structure. When the two chiral domains are equally mixed, the anomaly in the
differential resistivity disappears, indicating the strong pinning effect of
chiral domain wall.

<h3>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and  robustness versus charge noise</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00191" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00191</a>

</p><i>Hamza Jnane, Simon C Benjamin</i>
<p>Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks
for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs
using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is
suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the
most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modeling of
interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In
this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio
approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with
wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange
coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a
$\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for
various voltage profiles. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge
defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse
sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic
errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in
fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for
fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.

<h3>La$_4$Co$_4$X (X = Pb, Bi, Sb): a demonstration of antagonistic pairs as  a route to quasi-low dimensional ternary compounds</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00204" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00204</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tyler J. Slade, Nao Furukawa, Matthew Dygert, Siham Mohamed, Atreyee Das, Weiyi Xia, Cai-Zhuang Wang, Sergey L. Budko, Paul C. Canfield</i>
<p>We outline how pairs of strongly immiscible elements, referred to here as
antagonistic pairs, can be used to synthesize ternary compounds with
quasi-reduced dimensional motifs. By identifying third elements that are
compatible with a given antagonistic pair, ternary compounds can be formed in
which the third element segregates the immiscible atoms into spatially
separated substructures. Quasi-low dimensional structural units are a natural
consequence of the immiscible atoms seeking to avoid contact in the
solid-state. As proof of principle, we present the discovery and physical
properties of La$_4$Co$_4$X (X = Pb, Bi, Sb), a new family of intermetallics
based on the antagonistic pairs Co-Pb and Co-Bi. La$_4$Co$_4$X adopts a new
orthorhombic crystal structure (space group Pbam) containing quasi-2D Co slabs
and La-X layers that stack along the a-axis. Consistent with our proposal, the
La atoms separate the Co and X substructures, ensuring there are no direct
contacts between immiscible atoms. Within the Co slabs, the atoms occupy the
vertices of corner sharing tetrahedra and triangles, and this motif produces
flat electronic bands near the Fermi level that favor magnetism. The Co is
moment bearing in La$_4$Co$_4$X, and we show that whereas La$_4$Co$_4$Pb
behaves as a three dimensional antiferromagnet with T$_N$ = 220 K,
La$_4$Co$_4$Bi and La$_4$Co$_4$Sb have behavior consistent with low dimensional
magnetic coupling and ordering, with T$_N$ = 153 K and 143 K respectively. In
addition to the Pb, Bi, and Sb based La$_4$Co$_4$X compounds, we were likely
able to produce an analogous La$_4$Co$_4$Sn in polycrystalline form, although
we were unable to isolate single crystals. We anticipate that using mutually
compatible third elements with an antagonistic pair represents a generalizable
design principle for discovering new materials and structure types containing
low-dimensional substructures.

<h3>Design principles for fast and efficient self-assembly processes</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Florian M. Gartner, Erwin Frey</i>
<p>Self-assembly is a fundamental concept in biology and of significant interest
to nanotechnology. Significant progress has been made in characterizing and
controlling the properties of the resulting structures, both experimentally and
theoretically. However, much less is known about kinetic constraints and
determinants of dynamical properties like time efficiency, although these
constraints can become severe limiting factors of self-assembly processes. Here
we investigate how the time efficiency and other dynamical properties of
reversible self-assembly depend on the morphology (shape) of the building
blocks for systems in which the binding energy between the constituents is
large. As paradigmatic examples, we stochastically simulate the self-assembly
of constituents with triangular, square, and hexagonal morphology into
two-dimensional structures of a specified size. We find that the constituents'
morphology critically determines the assembly time and how it scales with the
size of the target structure. Our analysis reveals three key structural
parameters defined by the morphology: The nucleation size and attachment order,
which describe the effective order of the chemical reactions by which clusters
nucleate and grow, respectively, and the growth exponent, which determines how
the growth rate of an emerging structure scales with its size. Using this
characterization, we formulate an effective theory of the self-assembly
kinetics, which we show exhibits an inherent scale invariance. This allows us
to identify general scaling laws that describe the minimal assembly time as a
function of the size of the target structure. We show how these insights on the
kinetics of self-assembly processes can be used to design assembly schemes that
could significantly increase the time efficiency and robustness of artificial
self-assembly processes.

<p>We numerically study the flow of dense granular materials between parallel
plates driven by an external force. The granular materials form a jammed
solid-like state when the external force is below a critical force, while they
flow like fluids above the critical force. The transition is characterized by
the mass flux. The critical force depends on the average packing fraction and
the distance between the plates. The scaling laws for the critical force and
the mass flux are predicted theoretically based on a continuum model. They are

</p><i>Ganesh Sivaraman, Chris J. Benmore</i>
<p>Bridging the gap between diffuse x-ray or neutron scattering measurements and
predicted structures derived from atom-atom pair potentials in disordered
materials, has been a longstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. This
perspective gives a brief overview of the traditional approaches employed over
the past several decades. Namely, the use of approximate interatomic pair
potentials that relate 3-dimensional structural models to the measured
structure factor and its associated pair distribution function. The use of
machine learned interatomic potentials has grown in the past few years, and has
been particularly successful in the cases of ionic and oxide systems. Recent
advances in large scale sampling, along with a direct integration of scattering
measurements into the model development, has provided improved agreement
between experiments and large-scale models calculated with quantum mechanical
accuracy. However, details of local polyhedral bonding and connectivity in
meta-stable disordered systems still require improvement. Here we leverage
MACE-MP-0; a newly introduced equivariant foundation model and validate the
results against high-quality experimental scattering data for the case of
molten iron(II) oxide (FeO). These preliminary results suggest that the
emerging foundation model has the potential to surpass the traditional
limitations of classical interatomic potentials.

<p>We report on the evolution of the charge density wave (CDW) and spin density
wave (SDW) order of a chromium film following photoexcitation with an ultrafast
optical laser pulse. The CDW is measured by ultrafast time-resolved x-ray
diffraction of the CDW satellite that tracks the suppression and recovery of
the CDW following photoexcitation. We find that as the temperature of the film
approaches a discontinuous phase transition in the CDW and SDW order, the time
scales of recovery increase exponentially from the expected thermal time
scales. We extend a Landau model for SDW systems to account for this critical
slowing with the appropriate boundary conditions imposed by the geometry of the
thin film system. This model allows us to assess the energy barrier between
available CDW/SDW states with different spatial periodicities.

<p>Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in
the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed
charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation
of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study.
Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that
the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by the small
shift of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a
distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For
completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the
theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs
in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.

<p>Nanopowder consolidation under high strain rate shock compression is a
potential method for synthesizing and processing bulk nanomaterials. A thorough
investigation of the shock deformation of powder materials is of great
engineering significance. Here we combine nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
(NEMD) simulations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation methods to
investigate the deformation twinning and pore compaction in shock-compressed
np-Mg. Significant anisotropy and strong dependence on crystallographic
orientation are presented during shock-induced deformation twinning. During the
shock stage, three typical types of twins were firstly induced, namely {11-21}
twin (T1), {11-22} twin (T2) and {10-12} twin (T3). Most of them were generated
in grains with a larger angle between the impact direction and the c-axis of
the lattice. With the increase in strain rate, the types and quantities of
twins continued to enrich, but they did not occur when the strain rate was too
high. We also discussed the deformation mechanisms of the three types of twins
and found that the coupling of slip and shuffle dominated twin deformation. In
addition, void filling occurred due to the interaction of twinning and other
plastic deformations, leading to the densification of np-Mg. During the release
stage, an interesting reverse change was observed, where the twins produced by
the impact receded, and twins were produced in grains that were previously
difficult to produce.

<h3>Surface Chern-Simons theory for third-order topological insulators and  superconductors</h3>

</p><i>Zhi-Hao Huang, Yi Tan, Wei Jia, Long Zhang, Xiong-Jun Liu</i>
<p>Three-dimensional 3rd-order topological insulators (TOTIs) and
superconductors (TOTSCs), as the highestorder topological phases hosting zero
corner modes in physical dimension, has sparked extensive research interest.
However, such topological states have not been discovered in reality due to the
lack of experimental schemes of realization. Here, we propose a novel surface
Chern-Simons (CS) theory for 3rd-order topological phases, and show that the
theory enables a feasible and systematic design of TOTIs and TOTSCs. We show
that the emergence of zero Dirac (Majorana) corner modes is entirely captured
by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ CS term that can be further characterized by a
novel two-particle Wess-Zumino (WZ) term uncovered here in the surfaces of
three-dimensional topological materials. Importantly, our proposed CS term
characterization and two-particle WZ term mechanism provide a unique
perspective to design TOTIs (TOTSCs) in terms of minimal ingredients, feasibly
guiding the search for underlying materials, with promising candidates being
discussed. This work shall advance both the theoretical and experimental
research for highest-order topological matters.

<h3>Weak non-linearities of amorphous polymer under creep</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00355</a>
<br>
</p><i>Martin Roman-Faure, Hélène Montes, François Lequeux, Antoine Chateauminois</i>
<p>The creep behavior of an amorphous poly(etherimide) (PEI) polymer is
investigated in the vicinity of its glass transition in a weakly non linear
regime where the acceleration of the creep response is driven by local
configurational rearrangements. From the time shifts of the creep compliance
curves under increasing applied stresses in the range 1-15~\si{\mega\pascal},
we determine a macroscopic acceleration factor. At the start of creep, the
stress is homogeneous and the macroscopic acceleration can be assimilated to
that of the local rearrangements which is shown to vary as $f=e^{-(\sigma/Y)^n}
$ with $n=2 \pm 0.2$, where $\sigma$ is the local stress and $Y$ is a
decreasing function of compliance. This experimental result is in agreement
with the recent theory of Long \textit{et al.} (\textit{Phys. Rev. Mat.} (2018)
\textbf{2}, 105601 ) which predicts $n=2$. From a mean field approximation, we
interpret the variation of $Y$ with compliance as the result of the development
of stress heterogneities during creep.

<h3>Critical Nature of the Size Exponent of Polymers</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kazumi Suematsu, Haruo Ogura, Seiichi Inayama, Toshihiko Okamoto</i>
<p>On the basis of the thermodynamic theory of the excluded volume effects, we
show that the size exponent varies abruptly, depending on the change of the
segment concentration. For linear polymers, the exponent changes
discontinuously from $\nu=3/5$ for the isolated system ($\bar{\phi}=0$) in good
solvents to $\nu=1/2$ in the finite concentration ($0<\bar{\phi}\le1$), while
for branched polymers having $\nu_{0}=1/4$, the corresponding exponent varies
from $\nu=1/2$ ($\bar{\phi}=0$) to $\nu\cong 1/3$ ($0<\bar{\phi}\le1$).

<h3>Superconductivity and metallic behavior in heavily doped bulk single  crystal diamond and graphene/diamond heterostructure</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shisheng Lin, Xutao Yu, Minhui Yang, Huikai Zhong, Jiarui Guo</i>
<p>Owing to extremely large band gap of 5.5 eV and high thermal conductivity,
diamond is recognized as the most important semiconductor. The
superconductivity of polycrystalline diamond has always been reported, but
there are also many controversies over the existence of superconductivity in
bulk single crystal diamond and it remains a question whether a metallic state
exists for such a large band gap semiconductor. Herein, we realize a single
crystal superconducting diamond with a Hall carrier concentration larger than
3*1020 cm-3 by co-doped of boron and nitrogen. Furthermore, we show that
diamond can transform from superconducting to metallic state under similar
carrier concentration with tuned carrier mobility degrading from 9.10 cm2 V-1
s-1 or 5.30 cm2 V-1 s-1 to 2.66 cm2 V-1 s-1 or 1.34 cm2 V-1 s-1. Through
integrating graphene on a nitrogen and boron heavily co-doped diamond, the
monolayer graphene can be superconducting through combining Andreev reflection
and exciton mediated superconductivity, which may intrigue more interesting
superconducting behavior of diamond heterostructure.

<h3>Cooperatively Modulating Magnetic Anisotropy and Colossal  Magnetoresistance via Atomic-Scale Buffer Layers in Highly Strained  La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 Films</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Sheng Li, Zengxing Lu, Bin Lao, Xuan Zheng, Guoxin Chen, Run-Wei Li, Zhiming Wang</i>
<p>Simultaneous control of magnetic anisotropy and magnetoresistance, especially
with atomic scale precision, remains a pivotal challenge for realizing advanced
spintronic functionalities. Here we demonstrate cooperative continuous control
over both magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in highly strained
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) thin films. By inserting varying perovskite buffer
layers, compressively strained LSMO films transition from a ferromagnetic
insulator with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy to a metallic state with
in-plane anisotropy. Atomic-scale buffer layer insertion enables remarkably
acute, precise control to sharply modulate this magnetic phase transformation.
A gigantic 10,000% modulation of the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and an
exceptionally sharp transition from out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic
anisotropy are attained in just a few contiguous layers. These atomic-scale
correlations among electronic, magnetic, and structural order parameters yield
flexible multifunctional control promising for next-generation oxide
spintronics.

<h3>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in antiferromagnetic Z3 nodal net  metals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00371</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tingli He, Lei Li, Chaoxi Cui, Run-Wu Zhang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Guodong Liu, Xiaoming Zhang</i>
<p>In three dimensions, the quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport is commonly
thought to only appear in the systems with Q1D chain structure. Here, based on
first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the
Q1D transport can also be realized in many 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals
with topological node structure but without Q1D chain structure, including the
existing compounds \b{eta}-Fe2(PO4)O and Co2(PO4)O, and LiTi2O4. All these
materials have an AFM ground state and exhibit an ideal crossed Z3 Weyl nodal
line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines
traversing the whole Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an
AFM Z3 nodal net. Surprisingly, we find that the longitudinal conductivity
{\sigma}xx in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than
{\sigma}yy and {\sigma}zz in the up-spin channel, while {\sigma}yy dominates
the transport in the down-spin channel. This means that each spin channel has a
Q1D transport signature, and the principal moving direction for the two spin
channels is orthogonal, leading to Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This
novel phenomenon can not be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and
Q1D chain materials, and may solely be induced by the Z3 nodal net, as it
gradually disappears when the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net. Our
work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in
antiferromagnets, but also opens a new direction for the exploration of
topological spintronics.

<h3>Emergence of Accurate Atomic Energies from Machine Learned Noble Gas  Potentials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Frank Uhlig, Samuel Tovey, Christian Holm</i>
<p>The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) gives access to well-defined
local atomic energies. Due to their locality, these energies are potentially
interesting in fitting atomistic machine learning models as they inform about
physically relevant properties. However, computationally, quantum-mechanically
accurate local energies are notoriously difficult to obtain for large systems.
Here, we show that by employing semi-empirical correlations between different
components of the total energy, we can obtain well-defined local energies at a
moderate cost. We employ this methodology to investigate energetics in noble
liquids or argon, krypton, and their mixture. Instead of using these local
energies to fit atomistic models, we show how well these local energies are
reproduced by machine-learned models trained on the total energies. The results
of our investigation suggest that smaller neural networks, trained only on the
total energy of an atomistic system, are more likely to reproduce the
underlying local energy partitioning faithfully than larger networks.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that networks more capable of this energy
decomposition are, in turn, capable of transferring to previously unseen
systems. Our results are a step towards understanding how much physics can be
learned by neural networks and where this can be applied, particularly how a
better understanding of physics aids in the transferability of these neural
networks.

<h3>Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<p>Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which
often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of
dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can
still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of
dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of
dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the
regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs
appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding
number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding
number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we
confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence
of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing
MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.

<h3>Monte Carlo based techniques for quantum magnets with long-range  interactions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>P. Adelhardt, J. A. Koziol, A. Langheld, K. P. Schmidt</i>
<p>Long-range interactions are relevant for a large variety of quantum systems
in quantum optics and condensed matter physics. In particular, the control of
quantum-optical platforms promises to gain deep insights in quantum-critical
properties induced by the long-range nature of interactions. From a theoretical
perspective, long-range interactions are notoriously complicated to treat.
Here, we give an overview of recent advancements to investigate quantum magnets
with long-range interactions focusing on two techniques based on Monte Carlo
integration. First, the method of perturbative continuous unitary
transformations where classical Monte Carlo integration is applied within the
embedding scheme of white graphs. This linked-cluster expansion allows to
extract high-order series expansions of energies and observables in the
thermodynamic limit. Second, stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo
which enables calculations on large finite systems. Finite-size scaling can
then be used to determine physical properties of the infinite system. In recent
years, both techniques have been applied successfully to one- and
two-dimensional quantum magnets involving long-range Ising, XY, and Heisenberg
interactions on various bipartite and non-bipartite lattices. Here, we
summarise the obtained quantum-critical properties including critical exponents
for all these systems in a coherent way. Further, we review how long-range
interactions are used to study quantum phase transitions above the upper
critical dimension and the scaling techniques to extract these quantum critical
properties from the numerical calculations.

<h3>Revisiting log-periodic oscillations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00432</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jean-Marc Luck</i>
<p>This work is inspired by a recent study of a two-dimensional stochastic
fragmentation model. We show that the configurational entropy of this model
exhibits log-periodic oscillations as a function of the sample size, by
exploiting an exact recursion relation for the numbers of its jammed
configurations. This is seemingly the first statistical-mechanical model where
log-periodic oscillations affect the size dependence of an extensive quantity.
We then propose and investigate in great depth a one-dimensional analogue of
the fragmentation model. This one-dimensional model possesses a critical point,
separating a strong-coupling phase where the free energy is super-extensive
from a weak-coupling one where the free energy is extensive and exhibits
log-periodic oscillations. This model is generalized to a family of
one-dimensional models with two integer parameters, which exhibit essentially
the same phenomenology.

<p>Non-abelian symmetries are thought to be incompatible with many-body
localization, but have been argued to produce in certain disordered systems a
broad non-ergodic regime distinct from many-body localization. In this context,
we present a numerical study of properties of highly-excited eigenstates of
disordered chains with SU(3) symmetry. We find that while weakly disordered
systems rapidly thermalize, strongly-disordered systems indeed exhibit
non-thermal signatures over a large range of system sizes, similar to the one
found in previously studied SU(2) systems. Our analysis is based on the
spectral, entanglement, and thermalization properties of eigenstates obtained
through large-scale exact diagonalization exploiting the full SU(3) symmetry.

<p>A comprehensive study of the structural properties of the heavily
investigated rare-earth A2Ir2O7 series under extreme conditions is presented.
The series is covered by studying iridates with A = Pr, Sm, Dy-Lu. Temperature-
and pressure-dependent synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction experiments reveal
robustness of the pyrochlore structure throughout the rare-earth series, down
to 4 K and up to 20 GPa. The thermal expansivity and pressure compressibility
are determined, including Debye temperature, bulk modulus and Gr\"uneisen
parameter. Temperature and pressure evolution of the fractional coordinate of
oxygen at 48f Wyckoff position, the sole free atomic position parameter, is
investigated and discussed regarding the antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ir
magnetic moments. In addition, the pressure evolution of the crystal structure
of an IrO2 minority phase is followed. The tetragonal rutile-type structure is
orthorhombically distorted at 15 GPa, and the orthorhombic structure is not
fully stabilised up to 20 GPa.

<p>Recent x-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed spin excitations and charge
density waves in thin films of infinite-layer (IL) nickelates. However,
clarifying whether the origin of these phenomena is intrinsic to the material
class or attributable to impurity phases in the films has presented a major
challenge. Here we utilize topotactic methods to synthesize bulk crystals of
the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$ with crystallographically oriented surfaces. We
examine these crystals using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the
Ni $L_3$-edge to elucidate the spin and charge correlations in the bulk of the
material. While we detect the presence of prominent spin excitations in the
crystals, fingerprints of charge order are absent at the ordering vectors
identified in previous in thin-film studies. These results contribute to the
understanding of the bulk properties of LaNiO$_2$ and establish topotactically
synthesized crystals as viable complementary specimens for spectroscopic
investigations.

</p><i>Hiroto Tanaka, Hikaru Watanabe, Youichi Yanase</i>
<p>Noncentrosymmetric superconductors offer fascinating phenomena of quantum
transport and optics such as nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses.
Time-reversal symmetry breaking often plays an essential role in the emergence
and enhancement of nonreciprocal transport. In this paper, we show the
nonreciprocal optical responses in noncentrosymmetric superconductors arising
from time-reversal symmetry breaking by demonstrating them in $s$-wave
superconductors with a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field.
Numerical results reveal the superconductivity-induced bulk photocurrent and
second harmonic generation, which are forbidden at the zero magnetic field. We
discuss the properties and mechanisms of the superconducting nonlinear
responses emerging under the magnetic field. In particular, we investigate the
magnetic-field dependence of the photocurrent conductivity and clarify the
essential ingredients which give a contribution unique to superconductors under
the magnetic field. This contribution is dominant in the low carrier density
regime although the corresponding joint density of states is tiny. We attribute
the enhancement to the quantum geometry. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity
shows peculiar sign reversal at the transition to the topological
superconducting state. We propose a bulk probe of topological transition and
quantum geometry in superconductors.

<p>$\alpha$-TeO2 is widely used in acousto-optic devices due to its excellent
physical properties. Conventionally, $\alpha$-TeO2 single crystals were grown
using melt methods. Here, we report for the first time the growth of
$\alpha$-TeO2 single crystals using the aqueous solution method below 100
{\deg}C. Solubility curve of $\alpha$-TeO2 was measured, and then single
crystals with dimensions of 3.5x3.5x2.5 mm3 were successfully grown using seed
crystals that were synthesized from spontaneous nucleation. The as-grown single
crystals belong to the P41212 space group, evidenced by single crystal X-ray
diffraction and Rietveld refinement on powder diffraction. Rocking curve
measurements show that the as-grown crystals exhibit high crystallinity with a
full-width at half maxima (FWHM) of 57.2''. Ultraviolet-Visible absorption
spectroscopy indicates the absorption edge is 350 nm and the band gap is
estimated to be 3.58 eV. The density and Vickers hardness of as-grown single
crystals are measured to be 6.042 g/cm3 and 404 kg/mm2, repectively. Our
findings provide an easy-to-access and energy-saving method for growing single

</p><i>Jongmin Kim, Jongheum Jung, Junghoon Lee, Deokhwa Hong, Yong-il Shin</i>
<p>We present a turbulence-sustaining mechanism in a spinor Bose-Einstein
condensate, which is based on the chaotic nature of internal spin dynamics.
Magnetic driving induces a complete chaotic evolution of the local spin state,
thereby continuously randomizing the spin texture of the condensate to maintain
the turbulent state. We experimentally demonstrate the onset of turbulence in
the driven condensate as the driving frequency changes and show that it is
consistent with the regular-to-chaotic transition of the local spin dynamics.
This chaos-assisted turbulence establishes the spin-driven spinor condensate as
an intriguing platform for exploring quantum chaos and related superfluid
turbulence phenomena.

<h3>Minority magnons and mode branching in monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Thorbjørn Skovhus, Thomas Olsen</i>
<p>In this letter, we predict the existence of minority magnons in a monolayer
of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ using first principles calculations. Minority magnons
constitute a new type of collective magnetic excitations which increase the
magnetic moment rather than lower it, contrary to ordinary (majority) magnons.
The presence of such quasi-particles is made possible by the nontrivial
ferromagnetic band structure of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ originating from its
nonequivalent Fe sublattices. The result is a strong peak in the dynamic
spin-raising susceptibility $\chi^{-+}(\omega)$ in the long wavelength limit,
which is the hallmark of minority magnon physics. We calculate the
susceptibility using time-dependent density functional theory and perform a
detailed mode analysis, which allows us to separate and investigate the
individual magnon modes as well as the Stoner excitations that constitute the
many-body spectrum. For minority as well as majority magnons, the analysis
reveals a plethora of magnetic excitations, which in addition to the standard
main magnon branches include both satellite, valley and spin-inversion magnons,
originating from the itinerancy of the ferromagnetic order. The physics
underlying this analysis is in no way restricted to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, and
minority magnons are expected to be observable in many complex ferromagnetic
materials.

</p><i>Dongkyu Lee, Wooil Yang, Young-Woo Son, Jeil Jung</i>
<p>Rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) featuring partially flat bands has
emerged as an important platform to probe strong Coulomb correlation effects.
Theoretical consideration of local electron-electron interactions are of
particular importance for electronic eigenstates with a tendency to spatially
localize. We present a method to incorporate mean-field electron-electron
interaction corrections in the tight-binding hopping parameters of the band
Hamiltonian within the extended Hubbard model that incorporates ab initio
estimates of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Hubbard interactions for the
$\pi$ bands of RnG. Our Coulomb-interaction renormalized band structures
feature electron-hole asymmetry, band flatness, band gap, and
anti-ferromagnetic ground states in excellent agreement with available
experiments for $n \geq 4$. We reinterpret the putative gaps proposed in $n=3$
systems in terms of shifting electron and hole density of states peaks
depending on the range of the Coulomb interaction models.

<h3>Comment on "Controlled Bond Expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization  Group Ground State Search at Single-Site Costs" (Extended Version)</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00562" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00562</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ian P McCulloch, Jesse Osborne</i>
<p>In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)], Gleis, Li, and von
Delft present an algorithm for expanding the bond dimension of a Matrix Product
State wave function, giving accuracy similar to 2-site DMRG, but
computationally more efficient, closer to the performance of 1-site DMRG. The
Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto
two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to
extract a set of $k$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two
sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value
decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and
reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can
be done in time $O(dwD^3)$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection
onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2)
the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single $QR$ decomposition
(optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with
high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as $O(dwkD^2)$
i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension
$D$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors $k$; (3) several statements
about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the
variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms
including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar
RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many
advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions. We
also make some comments on the benchmarking MPS algorithms, and the overall
computational efficiency with respect to the accuracy of the calculation.

<h3>Enhancement of bubble transport in porous electrodes and catalysts</h3>

</p><i>Thomas Scheel, Paolo Malgaretti, Jens Harting</i>
<p>We investigate the formation and transport of gas bubbles across a model
porous catalyst/electrode using lattice Boltzmann simulations. This approach
enables us to systematically examine the influence of a wide range of
morphologies, flow velocities, and reaction rates on the efficiency of gas
production. By exploring these parameters, we identify critical parameter
combinations that significantly contribute to an enhanced yield of gas output.
Our simulations reveal the existence of an optimal pore geometry for which the
product output is maximized. Intriguingly, we also observe that lower flow
velocities improve gas production by leveraging on coalescence-induced bubble
detachment from the catalyst.

<h3>Chiral Spin Liquid on a Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</h3>

</p><i>Jian-Wei Yang, Wei-Wei Luo, W. Zhu, L. Wang, Bo Yang, Pinaki Sengupta</i>
<p>We demonstrate the existence of a topological chiral spin liquid in the
frustrated Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg model with an additional spin
chirality interaction, using numerically unbiased exact diagonalization and
density matrix renormalization group methods. We establish a quantum phase
diagram where conventional phases, including dimer singlet, plaquette singlet,
N{\' e}el and collinear phase, can be clearly identified by suitable local
order parameters. Among them a $SU(2)_1$ chiral spin liquid emerges in the
highly frustrated region, which is unambiguously identified by two
topologically degenerate ground states, modular matrix, and characteristic
level counting in entanglement spectrum, featuring the same topological order
of $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state. The phase boundaries among the different
orders are determined by the energy level crossing analysis and wave function
fidelity susceptibility.

<h3>Electrochemical Evaluation of Mg and a Mg-Al 5%Zn Metal Rich Primers for  Protection of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu Alloy in NaCl</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00610</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Korjenic, L. Blohm, J.R. Scully</i>
<p>High purity magnesium and a Mg-Al 5wt% Zn metal rich primer (MRP) were
compared for their ability to suppress intergranular corrosion (IGC) and
intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IG-SCC) in peak aged AA 7075-T651 by
sacrificial anode-based cathodic prevention. Tests were conducted in 0.6 M NaCl
solution under full immersion. These evaluations considered the ability of the
primer to attain an intermediate negative open circuit potential (OCP) such
that the galvanic couple potential with bare aluminum alloy (AA) 7075-T651
resided below a range of potentials where IGC is prevalent. The ability of the
primer to achieve an OCP negative enough that the AA 7075-T651 could be
protected by sacrificial anode-based cathodic prevention and the ability to
sustain this function over time were evaluated as a first step by utilizing a
NaCl solution. The primers consisted of epoxy resins embedded with either (1)
Mg flake pigments (MgRP) or (2) Mg flake pigments and spherical Al-5 wt.% Zn
together as a composite (MgAlRP). MgRP was an effective coating for cathodic
protection but dispensed less anodic charge than the composite MgAlRP.
Cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that some Mg flakes dissolved while
uniform surface oxidation occurred on the remaining Mg flakes which led to
impaired activation. The composite MgAlRP maintained a suitably negative OCP
over time, remained activated, dispensed high anodic charge, and remained an
anode in zero resistance ammeter testing. Chemical stability modeling and zero
resistance ammeter testing suggest that Mg corrosion elevates the pH which
dissolved aluminum oxides and hydroxide thereby activates the Al-5wt.% Zn
pigments, thereby providing a primary (i.e. Mg corrosion) and secondary process
to enable superior (activation of Al-5wt%Zn) sacrificial anode-based cathodic
protection.

<h3>Superconductivity Mediated by Nematic Fluctuations in Tetragonal  $\textrm{Fe}\textrm{Se}_{1-x}\textrm{S}_{x}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00615</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pranab Kumar Nag, Kirsty Scott, Vanuildo S. de Carvalho, Journey K. Byland, Xinze Yang, Morgan Walker, Aaron G. Greenberg, Peter Klavins, Eduardo Miranda, Adrian Gozar, Valentin Taufour, Rafael M. Fernandes, Eduardo H. da Silva Neto</i>
<p>Nematic phases, where electrons in a solid spontaneously break rotational
symmetry while preserving the translational symmetry, exist in several families
of unconventional superconductors [1, 2]. Although superconductivity mediated
by nematic fluctuations is well established theoretically [3-7], it has yet to
be unambiguously identified experimentally [8, 9]. A major challenge is that
nematicity is often intertwined with other degrees of freedom, such as
magnetism and charge order. The FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ family of iron based
superconductors provides a unique opportunity to explore this concept, as it
features an isolated nematic phase that can be suppressed by sulfur
substitution at a quantum critical point (QCP) near $x_c = 0.17$, where nematic
fluctuations are the largest [10-12]. Here, we performed scanning tunneling
spectroscopy measurements to visualize Boguliubov quasiparticle interference
patterns, from which we determined the momentum structure of the
superconducting gap near the Brillouin zone $\Gamma$ point of
FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$. The results reveal an anisotropic, near nodal gap with
minima that are $45^\circ$ rotated with respect to the Fe-Fe direction,
characteristic of a nematic pairing interaction, contrary to the usual
isotropic gaps due to spin mediated pairing in other tetragonal Fe-based
superconductors. The results are also in contrast with pristine FeSe, where the
pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations and the gap minima are aligned with
the Fe-Fe direction. Therefore, the measured gap structure demonstrates not
only a fundamental change of the pairing mechanism across the phase diagram of
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, but it also indicates the existence of superconductivity
mediated by nematic fluctuations in FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$.

<h3>Harnessing the superconducting diode effect through inhomogeneous  magnetic fields</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Leonardo Rodrigues Cadorim, Edson Sardella, Clécio Clemente de Souza Silva</i>
<p>We propose a superconducting diode device comprising a central
superconducting film flanked by two wires carrying an applied DC bias, suitably
chosen so as to generate different asymmetric field profiles. Through numerical
simulations of the coupled Ginzburg-Landau and heat-diffusion equations, we
show that this design is capable of efficiently breaking the reciprocity of the
critical current in the central superconductor, thus promoting the diode effect
in response to an applied AC current. By adjusting the DC bias in the wires, we
find the optimum inhomogeneous field profile that facilitates the entrance of
vortices and antivortices in a given polarity of the applied AC current and
impede their entrance in the other polarity. This way, the system behaves as an
ideal superconducting half-wave rectifier, with diode efficiencies surpassing
70%. Furthermore, we detail the behavior and diode efficiency of the system
under different experimental conditions, such as the substrate heat transfer
coefficient and the sweep rate of the external current.

<h3>Controlled creation of point defects in 3D colloidal crystals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Max P.M. Schelling, Janne-Mieke Meijer</i>
<p>Crystal defects crucially influence the properties of crystalline materials
and have been extensively studied. Even for the simplest type of defect - the
point defect - however, basic properties such as their diffusive behavior, and
their interactions, remain elusive on the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate
in-situ control over the creation of isolated point defects in a 3D colloidal
crystal allowing insight on a single particle level. Our system consists of
thermoresponsive microgel particles embedded in a crystal of non-responsive
colloids. Heating this mixed particle system triggers the shrinking of the
embedded microgels, which then vacate their lattice positions creating
vacancy-interstitial pairs. We use temperature-controlled confocal laser
scanning microscopy to verify and visualize the formation of the point defects.
In addition, by re-swelling the microgels we quantify the local lattice
distortion around an interstitial defect. Our experimental model system
provides a unique opportunity to shed new light on the interplay between point
defects, on the mechanisms of their diffusion, on their interactions, and on
collective dynamics.

<h3>Optimal Control of Underdamped Systems: An Analytic Approach</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00679" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00679</a>
<br>
</p><i>Julia Sanders, Marco Baldovin, Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi</i>
<p>Optimal control theory deals with finding protocols to steer a system between
assigned initial and final states, such that a trajectory-dependent cost
function is minimized. The application of optimal control to stochastic systems
is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications
ranging from stochastic thermodynamics, to biophysics and data science. Among
these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of
underdamped dynamics, leading to practical and conceptual difficulties.
In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering
finite time transitions at minimum dissipation for stochastic underdamped
dynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we prove that optimal
protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of
dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general
Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version
of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped
limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion.
Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose
variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is
directly accessible to experimental observation. Our results allow us to
numerically study cost asymmetries in expansion and compression processes and
make predictions for inertial corrections to optimal protocols in the Landauer
erasure problem at the nanoscale.

<h3>Understanding Trap States in InP and GaP Quantum Dots Through Density  Functional Theory</h3>

<p>The widespread application of III-V colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as
non-toxic, highly tunable emitters is stymied by their high density of trap
states. Here, we utilize density functional theory (DFT) to investigate trap
state formation in a diverse set of realistically passivated core-only InP and
GaP QDs. Through orbital localization techniques, we deconvolute the dense
manifold of trap states to allow for detailed assignment of surface defects. We
find that the three-coordinate species dominate trapping in III-V QDs and
identify features in the geometry and charge environment of trap centers
capable of deepening, or sometimes passivating, traps. Furthermore, we observe
stark differences in surface reconstruction between InP and GaP, where the more
labile InP reconstructs to passivate three-coordinate indium at the cost of
distortion elsewhere. These results offer explanations for experimentally
observed trapping behavior and suggest new avenues for controlling trap states
in III-V QDs.

<p>In the present study, the DFT+U method was employed to predict the
thermodynamic properties of Cr2O3, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5. Results were benchmarked
with experimental data showing high accuracy, except for the negative thermal
expansion (NTE) of Nb2O5, which is attributed to its polymorphic complexity.
Additionally, we extended our analysis to rutile-type oxides CrNbO4 and CrTaO4,
examining their entropy and heat capacity at finite temperatures. CrNbO4
displayed slightly higher entropy and heat capacity at high temperatures. The
mean linear thermal expansion coefficients for CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 from 500 K to
2000 K were predicted to be 6.00*10-6/K and 13.49*10-6/K, respectively,
corroborating with DFT predictions and experimental evidence. Our research
highlights the precision of the DFT+U and phonon methods in predicting the
thermodynamic properties of oxide materials, offering insights into the design
of corrosion-resistant materials.

<h3>Decoherence in Andreev spin qubits</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00710" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00710</a>
<br>
</p><i>Silas Hoffman, Max Hays, Kyle Serniak, Thomas Hazard, Charles Tahan</i>
<p>We theoretically study the dephasing of an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ) due to
electric and magnetic noise. Using a tight-binding model, we calculate the
Andreev states formed in a Josephson junction where the link is a semiconductor
with strong spin-orbit interaction. As a result of both the spin-orbit
interaction and induced superconductivity, the local charge and spin of these
states varies as a function of externally controllable parameters: the phase
difference between the superconducting leads, an applied magnetic field, and
filling of the underlying semiconductor. Concomitantly, coupling to
fluctuations of the electric or magnetic environment will vary, which informs
the rate of dephasing. We qualitatively predict the dependence of dephasing on
the nature of the environment, magnetic field, phase difference between the
junction, and filling of the semiconductor. Comparing the simulated electric-
and magnetic-noise-induced dephasing rate to experiment suggests that the
dominant source of noise is magnetic. Moreover, by appropriately tuning these
external parameters, we find sweet-spots at which we predict an enhancement in
ASQ coherence times.

<h3>Entropy Driven Inductive Response of Topological Insulators</h3>

<br>
</p><i>A. Mert Bozkurt, Sofie Kölling, Alexander Brinkman, İnanç Adagideli</i>
<p>3D topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and
extended surface states exhibiting a helical spin texture. In this work, we
investigate the hyperfine interaction between the spin-charge coupled transport
of electrons and the nuclear spins in these surface states. Previous work has
predicted that in the quantum spin Hall insulator phase, work can be extracted
from a bath of polarized nuclear spins as a resource. We employ nonequilibrium
Green's function analysis to show that a similar effect exists on the surface
of a 3D topological insulator, albeit rescaled by the ratio between electronic
mean free path and device length. The induced current due to thermal relaxation
of polarized nuclear spins has an inductive nature. We emphasize the inductive
response by rewriting the current-voltage relation in harmonic response as a
lumped element model containing two parallel resistors and an inductor. In a
low-frequency analysis, a universal inductance value emerges that is only
dependent on the device's aspect ratio. This scaling offers a means of
miniaturizing inductive circuit elements. An efficiency estimate follows from
comparing the spin-flip induced current to the Ohmic contribution. The
inductive effect is most prominent in topological insulators which have a large
number of spinful nuclei per coherent segment, of which the volume is given by
the mean free path length, Fermi wavelength and penetration depth of the
surface state.

<p>In this paper a thorough theoretical study of a new class of collective
excitations, dubbed hyperbolic surface phonon plasmon polaritons, is performed.
This new type of light-matter excitations are shown to have unique properties
that allows to explore them both as the basis of ultra-sensitive devices to the
dielectric nature of its surroundings. The system is a van der Waals
heterostructure -- a layered metamaterial, composed of different 2D materials
in direct contact one with another, namely graphene ribbons and hexagonal boron
nitride slabs of nanometric size. In the paper we discuss the spectrum of these
new class of excitations, the associated electromagnetic fields, the
sensitivity to the dielectric function of its surroundings, and the absorption
spectrum. All this is accomplished using an analytical model that considerably
diminishes the computational burden, as well as elucidates the underling
physical mechanism of the excitations supported by the device.

<h3>Dichotomous Dynamics of Magnetic Monopole Fluids</h3>

<p>A recent advance in the study of emergent magnetic monopoles was the
discovery that monopole motion is restricted to dynamical fractal trajectories
(J. Hall\'en et al, Science 378, 1218 (2022)) thus explaining the
characteristics of magnetic monopole noise spectra (Dusad, R. et al. Nature
571, 234 (2019); Samarakoon, A. M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119,
e2117453119 (2022)). Here we apply this new theory to explore the dynamics of
field-driven monopole currents, finding them comprised of two quite distinct
transport processes: initially swift fractal rearrangements of local monopole
configurations followed by conventional monopole diffusion. This theory also
predicts a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative loss-angle
for AC-field-driven currents. To explore these novel perspectives on monopole
transport, we introduce simultaneous monopole current control and measurement
techniques using SQUID-based monopole current sensors. For the canonical
material Dy2Ti2O7, we measure ${\Phi}(t)$, the time-dependence of magnetic flux
threading the sample when a net monopole current $J(t) = \dot{\Phi}(t)/\mu_0$
is generated by applying an external magnetic field $B_0(t)$. These experiments
find a sharp dichotomy of monopole currents, separated by their distinct
relaxation time-constants before and after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$ from monopole
current initiation. Application of sinusoidal magnetic fields $B_0(t) =
Bcos({\omega}t)$ generates oscillating monopole currents whose loss angle
${\theta}(f)$ exhibits a characteristic transition at frequency $f \approx 1.8$
kHz over the same temperature range. Finally, the magnetic noise power is also
dichotomic, diminishing sharply after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$. This complex
phenomenology represents a new form of heterogeneous dynamics generated by the
interplay of fractionalization and local spin configurational symmetry.

<p>Strongly-correlated transition-metal oxides are widely known for their
various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare-earth nickelates such as
LaNiO$_{3}$, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic,
spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced
by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and
emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$
superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from
LaTiO$_{3}$ into LaNiO$_{3}$ and is predicted to result in a high-spin state.
However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order has so far not been observed.
Here, by using muon spin rotation, x-ray absorption, and resonant inelastic
x-ray scattering, we present direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic
order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the
LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a
single LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface can essentially behave as an
atomically thin quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its
technological utilisation in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its
strong quasi-two-dimensional magnetic correlations and orbitally-polarized
planar ligand holes make its electronic and magnetic configurations resemble
the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an S
$\rightarrow$ 1 spin state instead.

<p>Delithiation of the known layered LiBC compound was predicted to induce
conventional superconductivity at liquid nitrogen temperatures but extensive
experimental work over the past two decades has detected no signs of the
expected superconducting transition. Using a combination of first-principles
stability analysis and anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, we have
investigated possible Li$_x$BC morphologies and established what particular
transformations of the planar honeycomb BC layers are detrimental to the
material's superconductivity. We propose that Li$_x$BC reintercalation with
select alkali and alkaline earth metals could lead to synthesis of otherwise
inaccessible metastable Li$_x$M$_y$BC superconductors with critical
temperatures ($T_{c}$) up to 73 K. The large-scale exploration of metal
borocarbides has revealed that NaBC and Li$_{1/2}$Na$_y$BC layered phases are
likely true ground states at low temperatures. The findings indicate that this
compositional space may host overlooked synthesizable compounds with potential
to break the $T_{c}$ record for conventional superconductivity in
ambient-pressure materials.

</p><i>Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman</i>
<p>The complexity of glasses makes it challenging to explain their dynamics.
Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising pathway for understanding
glassy dynamics by linking their structural features to rearrangement dynamics.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) was one of the first methods used to detect such
correlations. Specifically, a certain output of SVMs trained to predict
dynamics from structure, the distance from the separating hyperplane, was
interpreted as being linearly related to the activation energy for the
rearrangement. By numerical analysis of toy models, we explore under which
conditions it is possible to infer the energy barrier to rearrangements from
the distance to the separating hyperplane. We observe that such successful
inference is possible only under very restricted conditions. Typical tests,
such as the apparent Arrhenius dependence of the probability of rearrangement
on the inferred energy and the temperature, or high cross-validation accuracy
do not guarantee success. We propose practical approaches for measuring the
quality of the energy inference and for modifying the inferred model to improve
the inference, which should be usable in the context of realistic datasets.

<p>Topological defects, such as Stone-Wales defects and grain boundaries, are
common in 2D materials. In this exploratory study, we investigate the intricate
interplay of carbon contamination and topological defects revealing a new class
of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride. We demonstrate that carbon
contamination and strain can both stabilize Stone-Wales configurations with
desirable optical properties. Inspired by these results, we further demonstrate
that carbon atoms at grain boundaries can resolve energetic B-B and N-N bonds
and give rise to highly favorable atomic structures potentially leading to the
accumulation of carbon contamination at grain boundaries. We identify
carbon-contaminated topological defects that give rise to color centers
emitting in the visible spectral range with short radiative lifetime and high
Debye-Waller factors. Our discoveries shed light on a new class of defects and
pave the way towards the identification of color centers and single photon
emitters in hBN.
