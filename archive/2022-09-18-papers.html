<h3>Super-diffusion and crossover from diffusive to anomalous transport in a  one-dimensional system</h3>

<i>Anupam Kundu</i>
<br>
We study transport in a one-dimensional lattice system with two conserved
quantities -- `volume' and energy. Considering a slowly evolving local
equilibrium that is slightly deviated from an underlying global equilibrium, we
estimate the correction to the local equilibrium distribution. This correction
arises mainly through the space-time correlations of the local currents. In the
continuum limit, we show that the local equilibrium distribution along with the
correction yields drift-diffusion equation for the `volume' and super-diffusion
equation for the energy in the linear response regime as macroscopic
hydrodynamics. We find explicit expression of the super-diffusion equation.
Further, we find diffusive correction to the super-diffusive evolution. Such a
correction allows us to study a crossover from diffusive to anomalous
transport. We demonstrate this crossover numerically through the system size
scaling of the stationary current in non-equilibrium steady state prepared by
two reservoirs of different temperatures.

<h3>Notch Fracture predictions using the Phase Field method for Ti-6Al-4V  produced by Selective Laser Melting after different post-processing  conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07838</a>
<br>
<i>A. Díaz, J.M. Alegre, I.I. Cuesta, E. Martínez-Pañeda, Z. Zhang</i>
<br>
Ti-6Al-4V is a titanium alloy with excellent properties for lightweight
applications and its production through Additive Manufacturing processes is
attractive for different industrial sectors. In this work, the influence of
mechanical properties on the notch fracture resistance of Ti-6Al-4V produced by
Selective Laser Melting is numerically investigated. Literature data is used to
inform material behaviour. The as-built brittle behaviour is compared to the
enhanced ductile response after heat treatment (HT) and hot isostatic pressing
(HIP) post-processes. A Phase Field framework is adopted to capture damage
nucleation and propagation from two different notch geometries and a discussion
on the influence of fracture energy and the characteristic length is carried
out. In addition, the influence of oxygen uptake is analysed by reproducing
non-inert atmospheres during HT and HIP, showing that oxygen shifts fracture to
brittle failures due to the formation of an alpha case layer, especially for
the V-notch geometry. Results show that a pure elastic behaviour can be assumed
for the as-built SLM condition, whereas elastic-plastic phenomena must be
modelled for specimens subjected to heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing.
The present brittle Phase Field framework coupled with an elastic-plastic
constitutive analysis is demonstrated to be a robust prediction tool for notch
fracture after different post-processing routes.

<h3>Effects of inertia on conformation and dynamics of active filaments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07880</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Fazelzadeh, Ehsan Irani, Zahra Mokhtari, Sara Jabbari-Farouji</i>
<br>
Many macroscopic active systems such as snakes, birds and fishes have
flexible shapes and inertial effects on their motion, in contrast to their
microscopic counterparts, cannot be ignored. Nonetheless, the consequences of
interplay between inertia and flexibility on their shapes and dynamics remain
unexplored. Here, we examine inertial effects on the most studied active
flexible system, {\it i.e.} linear active filaments pertinent to worms, snakes
and filamentous robots. Performing Langevin dynamics simulations of active
polymers with underdamped and overdamped dynamics for a wide range of contour
lengths and activities, we uncover striking inertial effects on their
conformation and dynamics. Inertial collisions increase the persistence length
of active polymers and remarkably alter their scaling behavior. In stark
contrast to passive polymers, inertia leaves its fingerprint at long times by
an enhanced diffusion of the center of mass. We rationalize inertia-induced
enhanced dynamics by analytical calculations of center of mass velocity
correlations, revealing significant contributions from active force
fluctuations convoluted by inertial relaxation.

<h3>Majorana fusion in interacting one-dimensional Kitaev chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07913</a>
<br>
<i>Bradraj Pandey, Narayan Mohanta, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
We employ a time-dependent real-space local density-of-states method to study
the movement and fusion of Majorana zero modes in the 1D interacting Kitaev
model, based on the time evolution of many-body states. We study the dynamics
and both fusion channels of Majoranas using time-dependent potentials, either
{\it Wall} or {\it Well}, focusing on the local density-of-states and
charge-density of fermions varying with time. For a {\it Wall}, i.e. repulsive
strong potential, after fusion of Majoranas the electron (or hole) forms at
$\omega=0$, whereas for a {\it Well}, i.e. attractive deep potential, electron
(or hole) forms at $\omega \sim -V$, where $V$ is the Coulomb repulsion. We
also describe specific upper and lower limits on the Majorana movement needed
to reduce non-adiabatic effects as well as to avoid poisoning due to
decoherence, focusing on forming a full electron (or hole) after the fusion.

<h3>Prediction of $\textrm{CO}_2$ Adsorption in Nano-Pores with Graph Neural  Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07567</a>
<br>
<i>Guojing Cong, Anshul Gupta, Rodrigo Neumann, Maira de Bayser, Mathias Steiner, Breanndán Ó Conchúir</i>
<br>
We investigate the graph-based convolutional neural network approach for
predicting and ranking gas adsorption properties of crystalline Metal-Organic
Framework (MOF) adsorbents for application in post-combustion capture of
$\textrm{CO}_2$. Our model is based solely on standard structural input files
containing atomistic descriptions of the adsorbent material candidates. We
construct novel methodological extensions to match the prediction accuracy of
classical machine learning models that were built with hundreds of features at
much higher computational cost. Our approach can be more broadly applied to
optimize gas capture processes at industrial scale.

<h3>Evolution of electronic and magnetic properties of  Sr$\mathbf{_2}$IrO$\mathbf{_4}$ under strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07573" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07573</a>
<br>
<i>Ekaterina M. Parschke, Wei-Chih Chen, Rajyavardhan Ray, Cheng-Chien Chen</i>
<br>
Motivated by properties-controlling potential of the strain, we investigate
strain dependence of structure, electronic and magnetic properties of
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ using complementary theoretical tools: {\it ab-initio}
calculations, analytical approaches (rigid octahedra picture, Slater-Koster
integrals), and extended $t-{\mathcal{J}}$ model. We find that strain affects
both Ir-Ir distance and Ir-O-Ir angle, and the rigid octahedra picture is not
relevant. Second, we find fundamentally different behavior for compressive and
tensile strain. One remarkable feature is the formation of two subsets of bond-
and orbital- dependent carriers, a compass-like model, under compression. This
originates from the strain-induced renormalization of the Ir-O-Ir superexchange
and O on-site energy. We also show that under compressive (tensile) strain,
Fermi surface becomes highly dispersive (relatively flat). Already at a tensile
strain of $1.5\%$, we observe spectral weight redistribution, with the
low-energy band acquiring almost purely singlet character. These results can be
directly compared with future experiments.

<h3>Pixel-wise classification in graphene-detection with tree-based machine  learning algorithms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07578</a>
<br>
<i>Woon Hyung Cho, Jiseon Shin, Young Duck Kim, George J. Jung</i>
<br>
Mechanical exfoliation of graphene and its identification by optical
inspection is one of the milestones in condensed matter physics that sparked
the field of 2D materials. Finding regions of interest from the entire sample
space and identification of layer number is a routine task potentially amenable
to automatization. We propose supervised pixel-wise classification methods
showing a high performance even with a small number of training image datasets
that require short computational time without GPU. We introduce four different
tree-based machine learning algorithms -- decision tree, random forest, extreme
gradient boost, and light gradient boosting machine. We train them with five
optical microscopy images of graphene, and evaluate their performances with
multiple metrics and indices. We also discuss combinatorial machine learning
models between the three single classifiers and assess their performances in
identification and reliability. The code developed in this paper is open to the
public and will be released at github.com/gjung-group/Graphene_segmentation.

<h3>Chasing the spin gap through the phase diagram of a frustrated Mott  insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07639</a>
<br>
<i>A. Pustogow, Y. Kawasugi, H. Sakurakoji, N. Tajima</i>
<br>
The quest for entangled spin excitations has stimulated intense research on
frustrated magnetic systems. For almost two decades, the triangular-lattice
Mott insulator $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ has been the hottest
candidate for a $gapless$ quantum spin liquid with itinerant spinons. Very
recently, however, this scenario was overturned as electron-spin-resonance
(ESR) studies unveiled a spin gap, calling for reevaluation of the magnetic
ground state. Here we achieve a precise mapping of this spin-gapped phase
through the Mott transition by ultrahigh-resolution strain tuning. Our
transport experiments reveal a reentrance of charge localization below
$T^{\star}=6$ K associated with a gap size of 30-50 K. The negative slope of
the insulator-metal boundary, $dT^{\star}/dp<0$, evidences the low-entropy
nature of the spin-singlet ground state. By tuning the enigmatic '6 K anomaly'
through the phase diagram of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, we identify
it as the transition to a valence-bond-solid phase, with typical magnetic and
structural fingerprints, that persists at $T\rightarrow 0$ until unconventional
superconductivity and metallic transport proliferate.

<h3>The Shastry-Sutherland Compound SrCu2(BO3)2 Studied up to the Saturation  Magnetic Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07652" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07652</a>
<br>
<i>T. Nomura, P. Corboz, A. Miyata, S. Zherlitsyn, Y. Ishii, Y. Kohama, Y. H. Matsuda, A. Ikeda, C. Zhong, H. Kageyama, F. Mila</i>
<br>
We report ultrasound velocity and magnetostriction results for the
orthogonal-dimer antiferromagnet SrCu2(BO3)2 up to the saturation magnetic
field. In addition to anomalies that can be associated to plateaus with
fractional magnetization M/Ms=1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, and 1/2, we have detected
higher-field sound-velocity and magnetostriction anomalies at 116, 127, and 139
T. Strikingly, the anomalies of the sound velocity of the c66 acoustic mode are
very much plateau dependent, with a huge decrease by -50% in the 1/2 plateau
state due to the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic instability triggered by the
triplet crystallization into a checkerboard pattern. This effect, as well as
the high-field anomalies, can be well accounted for by tensor-network
calculations (iPEPS) of the Shastry-Sutherland model. We conclude in particular
that the anomaly at 139 T corresponds to the saturation of magnetization, and
we suggest that the other two anomalies at 116 and 127 T are related to
supersolid phases whose energies are nearly degenerate in this field range.

<h3>Large Bilinear Magnetoresistance from Rashba Spin-Splitting on the  Surface of a Topological Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07666" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07666</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Wang, Binbin Liu, Yue-Xin Huang, Sivakumar V. Mambakkam, Yong Wang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Xian-Lei Sheng, Stephanie A. Law, John Q. Xiao</i>
<br>
In addition to the topologically protected linear dispersion, a
band-bending-confined two-dimensional electron gas with tunable Rashba
spin-splitting (RSS) was found to coexist with the topological surface states
on the surface of topological insulators (TIs). Here, we report the observation
of large bilinear magnetoresistance (BMR) in Bi2Se3 films decorated with
transition metal atoms. The magnitude of the BMR sensitively depends on the
type and amount of atoms deposited, with a maximum achieved value close to
those of strong Rashba semiconductors. Our first-principles calculations
reproduce the quantum well states and reveal sizable RSS in all Bi2Se3
heterostructures with broken inversion symmetry. Our results show that
charge-spin interconversion through RSS states in TIs can be fine-tuned through
surface atom deposition and easily detected via BMR for potential spintronic
applications.

<h3>Observation of anisotropic Dirac cones in the topological material  Ti2Te2P</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07671</a>

<br>
Anisotropic bulk Dirac (or Weyl) cones in three dimensional systems have
recently gained intense research interest as they are examples of materials
with tilted Dirac (or Weyl) cones indicatig the violation of Lorentz
invariance. In contrast, the studies on anisotropic surface Dirac cones in
topological materials which contribute to anisotropic carrier mobility have
been limited. By employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
first-principles calculations, we reveal the anisotropic surface Dirac
dispersion in a tetradymite material Ti2Te2P on the (001) plane of the
Brillioun zone. We observe the quasi-elliptical Fermi pockets at the M -point
of the Brillouin zone forming the anisotropic surface Dirac cones. Our
calculations of the Z2 indices confirm that the system is topologically
non-trivial with multiple topological phases in the same material. In addition,
the observed nodal-line like feature formed by bulk bands makes this system
topologically rich.

<h3>Observation of thermodynamics originating from a mixed-spin  ferromagnetic chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07681</a>
<br>
<i>H. Yamaguchi, S. C. Furuya, S. Morota, S. Shimono, T. Kawakami, Y. Kusanose, Y. Shimura, K. Nakano, Y. Hosokoshi</i>
<br>
We present a model compound that forms a mixed-spin ferromagnetic chain. Our
material design, based on the organic radicals, affords a verdazyl-based
complex (p-Py-V)2[Mn(hfac)2]. The molecular orbital calculations of the
compound indicate the formation of a mixed spin-(1/2, 1/2, 5/2) ferromagnetic
chain. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility reveals its
ferromagnetic behavior. The magnetic specific heat exhibits a double-peak
structure and indicates a phase transition at the low-temperature peak. The
observed characteristics are explained using the quantum Monte Carlo
calculations. Furthermore, the modified spin-wave theory verifies that the
double-peak structure of the specific heat significantly reflects the relative
ration of the acoustic excitation band and the optical excitation gap.

<h3>Field-direction Dependence of Majorana-mediated Spin Transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07717" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07717</a>
<br>
<i>H. Taguchi, A. Koga, Y. Murakami, J. Nasu, H. Tsuchiura</i>
<br>
We study the field-direction dependence of the Majorana-mediated spin
transport in the Kitaev clusters with zigzag and armchair edges, applying a
static magnetic field to one of the edges and a magnetic pulsed field to the
other edges. By means of the exact diagonalization method, we calculate the
time-evolution of the spin moments in both edge regions to clarify how the
directions of two fields and shape of the edges affect the Majorana-mediated
spin transport.

<h3>Decoration of graphene nanoribbons by $5d$ transition-metal elements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07722</a>

<br>
Graphene is a famous truly two-dimensional (2D) material, possessing a
cone-like energy structure near the Fermi level and treated as a gapless
semiconductor. Its unique properties trigger researchers to find applications
of it. The gapless feature shrinks the development of graphene nanoelectronics.
Making one-dimensional (1D) strips of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) could be one
of the promising routes to modulating the electronic and optical properties of
graphene. The electronic and optical properties of GNRs are highly sensitive to
the edge and width. The tunability in electronic and optical properties further
implies the possibilities of GNR application. However, the dangling bonds at
ribbon edges remain an open question in GNR systems. Various passivation at the
ribbon edge might change the essential physical properties. In this work, $5d$

<br>
Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction at oxide heterostructures emerges as a
much sought-after feature in the context of oxide spintronics and
spin-orbitronics. KTaO$_3$ (KTO) is one of the best substrates available for
the purpose, owing to its strong spin-orbit interaction and alternating $+1|-1$
charged layers along the (001) direction. Employing first-principles
calculations within density functional theory (DFT) and proposing a possible
electrostatic model for charge transfer to the surfaces of KTO slabs, we
comprehensively analyze Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction with the help of
three-dimensional band dispersion, isoenergetic contours, and projected spin
textures $-$ all directly obtained from our DFT results $-$ in a thin
insulating slab and a conducting thick slab of KTO. Our results reveal
reasonably strong linear Rashba interaction with no signature of Dresselhaus or
higher order Rashba interactions in the systems considered here. The rigorous
analysis presented here may be crucial for future developments in oxide
spintronics.

<h3>Spin fluctuations in the 112-type iron-based superconductor  Ca$_{0.82}$La$_{0.18}$Fe$_{0.96}$Ni$_{0.04}$As$_{2}$</h3>

We report time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering (INS) investigations on
the spin fluctuation spectrum in the 112-type iron-based superconductor (FeSC)
Ca$_{0.82}$La$_{0.18}$Fe$_{0.96}$Ni$_{0.04}$As$_{2}$ (CaLa-112). In comparison
to the 122-type FeSCs with a centrosymmetric tetragonal lattice structure
(space group $I4/mmm$) at room temperature and an in-plane stripe-type
antiferromagnetic (AF) order at low temperature, the 112 system has a
noncentrosymmetric structure (space group $P2_{1}$) with additional zigzag
arsenic chains between Ca/La layers and a magnetic ground state with similar
wavevector $\mathbf{Q}_{\mathrm{AF}}$ but different orientations of ordered
moments in the parent compounds. Our INS study clearly reveals that the
in-plane dispersions and the bandwidth of spin excitations in the
superconducting CaLa-112 closely resemble to those in 122 systems. While the
total fluctuating moments $\langle m^2 \rangle\approx 4.6\pm0.2 \mu_B^2$/Fe are
larger than 122 system, the dynamic correlation lengths are similar
($\xi\approx 10$ \AA). These results suggest that superconductivity in iron
arsenides may have a common magnetic origin under similar magnetic exchange
couplings with a dual nature from local moments and itinerant electrons,
despite their different magnetic patterns and lattice symmetries.

<h3>Monte Carlo study of cuprate superconductors in a four-band $d$-$p$  model: Role of orbital degrees of freedom</h3>

<br>
Understanding the complex phase diagram of cuprate superconductors is a
long-standing challenging problem. Recent studies have shown that orbital
degrees of freedom, both Cu $e_g$ orbitals and O $p$ orbitals, are a key
ingredient for a unified understanding of cuprate superconductors, including
the material dependence. Here we investigate a four-band $d$-$p$ model derived
from the first-principles calculations with the variational Monte Carlo method,
which allows us to elucidate competing orders on an equal footing. The obtained
results can consistently explain the doping dependence of superconductivity,
antiferromagnetic and stripe phases, phase separation in the underdoped region,
and also novel magnetism in the heavily-overdoped region. Our four-band $d$-$p$
model with neighbouring intersite interactions is a minimal model to describe
the phase diagram comprehensively. The presence of $p$ orbitals is critical to
the charge-stripe features, which induce two types of stripe phases with
$s'$-wave and $d$-wave bond stripe. On the other hand, the presence of
$d_{z^2}$ orbital is indispensable to material dependence of the
superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$), and enhances local
magnetic moment as a source of novel magnetism in the heavily-overdoped region
as well. These findings beyond one-band description could provide a major step
toward a full explanation of unconventional normal state and high
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in cuprate supercondutors.

<h3>Introduction to topological defects: from liquid crystals to particle  physics</h3>

<br>
Liquid crystals are assemblies of rod-like molecules which self-organize to
form mesophases, in-between ordinary liquids and anisotropic crystals. At each
point, the molecules collectively orient themselves along a privileged
direction, which locally defines an orientational order. Sometimes, this order
is broken and singularities appear in the form of topological defects. This
tutorial article is dedicated to the geometry, topology and physics of these
defects. We introduce the main models used to describe the nematic phase and
discuss the isotropic-nematic phase transition. Then, we present the different
families of defects in nematics and examine some of their physical outcomes.
Finally, we show that topological defects are universal patterns of nature,
appearing not only in soft matter, but also in biology, cosmology, geology and
even particle physics.

<h3>Insights into the high-pressure behaviour of solid bromine from hybrid  DFT calculations</h3>

<br>
Understanding the properties of molecular solids at high pressure is a key
element in the development of new solid-state theories. However, the most
commonly used generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) of the density
functional theory (DFT) often fails to correctly describe the behavior of these
systems at high pressure. Here we utilize the hybrid DFT approach to model the
properties of elemental bromine at high pressure. The calculations reproduce in
very good agreement with experiment the properties of the molecular phase I
(Cmca symmetry) and its pressure-induced transition into the non-molecular
phase II (Immm). The experimentally yet unobserved transition into phase III
(I4/mmm) is predicted to occur at 128 GPa, followed by subsequent formation of
an fcc lattice at 188 GPa. Analysis of the structure and electronic properties
of the modelled phases indicates that the molecular Cmca phase becomes metallic
just at the borderline of its stability, and that both Immm and I4/mmm phases
are metallic and quasi-2D. Finally, we show that the incommensurate phases of
bromine postulated from experiment are transient species which can be viewed as
intermediates in the dissociation process occurring at the boundary of the
transition from phase I to phase II.

<h3>Localized State-Induced Enhanced Intrinsic Phonon-Free Optical  Transition in Silicon Nanocrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07747" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07747</a>

<br>
Silicon photoluminescence and lasing have been critical issues to
breakthrough bottlenecks in the understanding of luminescence mechanisms.
Unfortunately, long-standing disputes about the exciton recombination mechanism
and fluorescence lifetime remain unresolved, especially about whether silicon
nanocrystals (Si NCs) can realize fast direct-bandgap-like optical transitions.
Here, using ground-state and excited-state density functional theory (DFT), we
obtained intrinsic phonon-free optical transitions at sizes from Si22 to Si705,
showing that very small Si NCs can realize a strong direct optical transition.
Orbital labeling results show that this rapid transition does not come from the
{\Gamma}-{\Gamma} -like transition, contrary to the conclusions from the
effective mass approximation (EMA) and that {\Gamma}-X mixing leads to a
quasi-direct bandgap. This anomalous transition is particularly intense with
decreasing size (or enhancement of quantum confinement). By investigating
electron and hole distributions generated in the optical transition, localized
state-induced enhanced emission (LIEE) in Si NCs was proposed. Quantum
confinement (QC) distorts the excited-state electron spatial distribution by
localizing Bloch waves into the NC core, resulting in increased hole and
electron overlap, thus inducing a fast optical process. This work resolves
important debates and proposes LIEE to explain the anomalous luminescence--a
phase transition from weak (or none) luminescent state to strong optical
transition, which will aid attempts at realizing high-radiative-rate NCs
materials and application-level Si lasers.

<h3>Nucleation of frictional slip: A yielding or a fracture process?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07814" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07814</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Castellano, Flavio Lorez, David Kammer</i>
<br>
The onset of frictional sliding between contacting bodies under shear load is
nucleated by the quasi-static growth of localized slip patches. After reaching
a certain critical size, these patches become unstable and continue growing
dynamically, eventually causing the sliding of the entire interface. Two
different theories have been used to compute the nucleation length of such
patches depending on the dominant process driving their growth. If it is only
the yielding of contact asperities (large-scale yielding), a stress criterion
is applied, based on linear stability analysis, whereas if fracture dominates,
an energy criterion is applied, based on fracture mechanics and classical
nucleation theory. Both approaches contain important underlying assumptions
that are well-suited to describe either one situation or the other. However,
what happens in-between is not captured by any of them. In this work, we use
numerical simulations to study what is the dominant underlying process driving
nucleation for different conditions of heterogeneity and what are the
implications for nucleation dynamics and the onset of frictional sliding. We
show that large frictional heterogeneities enable a transition from a
yielding-driven nucleation phase to a fracture-driven one. This transition
occurs only above a certain level of heterogeneity and can either be
quasi-static (stable) or dynamic (unstable), depending on the correlation
length of frictional strength along the interface and the difference in
strength between the strongest and the weakest point (the amplitude). Unstable
transitions generate localized dynamic slip events, whose magnitude increases
with higher correlation length and decreases with larger amplitude. Our work
sheds new light on the role of heterogeneity and fracture in the nucleation of
frictional slip, bridging the gap between the two main governing theories for
nucleation.

<h3>Hybrid Symmetry Breaking in Classical Spin Models With Subsystem  Symmetries</h3>

<br>
<i>Giovanni Canossa, Lode Pollet, Ke Liu</i>
<br>
We investigate two concrete cases of phase transitions breaking a subsystem
symmetry. The models are two classical compass models featuring line-flip and
plane-flip symmetries and correspond to special limits of a Heisenberg-Kitaev
Hamiltonian on a cubic lattice. We show that these models experience a hybrid
symmetry breaking by which the system display distinct symmetry broken patterns
in different submanifolds. For instance, the system may look magnetic within a
chain or plane but nematic-like when observing from one dimensionality higher.
We fully characterize the symmetry-broken phases by a set of subdimensional
order parameters and confirm numerically both cases undergo a non-standard
first-order phase transition. Our results provide new insights into phase
transitions involving subsystem symmetries and generalize the notion of
conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking.

<h3>Resonance-induced acceleration of the RBNE-BNE segregation inversion of  granular mixtures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07877</a>
<br>
<i>Yufei Shao, Anghao Li, Zaizheng Wang, Min Sun, Decai Huang</i>
<br>
This paper presents the experiments and simulations on the resonance-induced
acceleration of the reverse Brazil nut effect (RBNE)-Brazil nut effect (BNE)
segregation inversion of binary mixtures in flat-bottom and circular-bottom
containers. Both experimental and simulation results indicate that the starting
location of the sinkage of heavier grains at the top layer is triggered with
certain randomness in the flat-bottom container, whereas it first occurs at
either of the lateral edges of the bottom in the circular-bottom container. The
quantified segregation factors in simulations show that the transition from the
RBNE segregation state to the BNE segregation state happens faster in the
circular-bottom container than that in the flat-bottom container. The
occurrence of standing-wave resonant spots of higher and lower granular
temperature accelerates the RBNE-BNE segregation inversion. From the elastic
collision model of single grain, the bottom with a larger angle leads to more
energy transfer from the vertical direction to the horizontal direction. The
theoretical predictions are confirmed by the simulations of a monodisperse
granular bed. The flat-bottom container has a uniform distribution with a
standing-wave period of granular temperature and packing density, whereas the
circular-bottom container possesses a higher granular temperature in the
horizontal direction and a lower packing density at the lateral edges of the
circular bottom. Owing to the buoyancy effect, heavier grains easily sink first
at the resonant spots with higher temperature.

<h3>Wetting controlled boiling at the nanoscale</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07900</a>
<br>

<br>
Boiling is the out-of-equilibrium transition which occurs when a liquid is
heated above its vaporization temperature. At the nanoscale, boiling may be
triggered by irradiated nanoparticles immersed in water or nanocomposite
surfaces and often results in micro-explosions. It is generally believed that
nanoscale boiling occurs homogeneously when the local fluid temperature exceeds
its spinodal temperature, around 573 K for water. Here, we employ molecular
dynamics simulations to show that nanoscale boiling is an heterogenous
phenomenon occuring when water temperature exceeds a wetting dependent onset
temperature. This temperature can be 100 K below spinodal temperature if the
solid surface is weakly wetting water. In addition, we show that boiling is a
slow process controlled by the solid-liquid interfacial thermal conductance,
which turns out to decrease significantly prior to phase change yielding long
nucleation times. We illustrate the generality of this conclusion by
considering both a spherical metallic nanoparticle immersed in water and a
solid surface with nanoscale wetting heterogeneities. These results pave the
way to control boiling using nanoscale patterned surfaces.

<h3>On the equivalence of the Nernst theorem and its consequence</h3>

<br>
One general consequence of the Nernst theorem is derived, i.e., the various
heat capacities of a thermodynamic system under different constraints approach
zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero. The temperature dependence of
the heat capacity of any thermodynamic system at ultra-low temperatures is
revealed through this consequence. Moreover, the general form and the simplest
expression of the heat capacities of thermodynamic systems at ultra-low
temperatures are deduced. Some significant discussion and results are given.
One new research method is provided by using this consequence. Finally, the
equivalence between the Nernst theorem and its consequence is rigorously
proved, so that this consequence may be referred to another description of the
third law of thermodynamics.

<h3>A simple KPFM-based approach for electrostatic-free topographic  measurements: the case of MoS$_2$ on SiO$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07925" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07925</a>
<br>
<i>Aloïs Arrighi, Nathan Ullberg, Vincent Derycke, Benjamin Grévin</i>
<br>
A simple implementation of Kelvin probe force microscopy is reported that
enables recording topographic images in the absence of any component of the
electrostatic force. Our approach is based on a close loop z-spectroscopy
operated in data cube mode. Curves of the tip-sample distance as a function of
time are recorded onto a 2D grid. A dedicated circuit holds the KPFM
compensation bias and subsequently cut off the modulation voltage during
well-defined time-windows within the spectroscopic acquisition. Topographic
images are recalculated from the matrix of spectroscopic curves. This approach
is applied to the case of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) monolayers
grown by chemical vapour deposition on silicon oxide substrates. In addition,
we check to what extent a proper stacking height estimation can also be
performed by recording series of images for decreasing values of the bias
modulation amplitude. The outputs of both approaches are shown to be fully
consistent. The results exemplify how in the operating conditions of
non-contact AFM under ultra-high vacuum, the stacking height values can
dramatically be overestimated due to variations in the tip-surface capacitive
gradient, even though the KPFM controller nullifies the potential difference.
We show that the number of atomic layers of a TMD can be safely assessed, only
if the KPFM measurement is performed with a modulated bias amplitude reduced at
its strict minimum or, even better, without any modulated bias. Last, the
spectroscopic data reveal that defects at the TMD/oxide interface can have a
counterintuitive impact on the electrostatic landscape, resulting in an
apparent decrease of the measured stacking height by conventional nc-AFM/KPFM
compared to non-defective sample areas. Hence, electrostatic free z-imaging
proves to be a promising tool to assess the existence of defects in atomically
thin TMD layers grown on oxides

<br>
The transition-metal dichalcogenide tantalum disulphide (1$T$-TaS$_2$) hosts
a commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) at temperatures below 165$~$K where
it also becomes insulating. The low temperature CCDW phase can be driven into a
metastable "mosaic" phase by means of either laser or voltage pulses which
shows a large density of CDW domain walls as well as a closing of the
electronic band gap. The exact origins of this pulse-induced metallic mosaic
are not yet fully understood. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy (STM/STS), we observe the occurrence of such a metallic mosaic
phase on the surface of TaS$_2$ without prior pulse excitation over continuous
areas larger than $100 \times 100~$nm$^2$ and macroscopic areas on the
millimetre scale. We attribute the appearance of the mosaic phase to the
presence of surface defects which arrange into the characteristic dense domain
wall network. Based on our STM measurements, we further argue how the
appearance of the metallic behaviour in the mosaic phase can be explained by
local stacking differences of the top two layers induced by the large number of
domain walls. Thus, we provide a potential avenue to explain the origin of the
pulse induced mosaic phase.

<br>
We report about a previously not discussed structural feature of the model
Kob-Andersen (KA) and Wahnstrom (WH) supercooled liquid systems. In particular,
we observed that on cooling and supercooling, in the KA system, the large
particles exhibit an increasing tendency to form chains. In the WH system, the
chains are formed by the smaller and all particles. The numbers of particles
(NoPs) in the chains, if calculated on the inherent structures, exhibit a
crossover at the potential energy landscape crossover temperature. The observed
chains demonstrate, in a direct way, the presence in the studied liquids of the
structural angular ordering on length scale up to 9 inter atomic distances. In
our view, the observed chains may represent a tendency of particles in liquids
to form small 1D crystals in 3D liquids.

<br>
Topological materials have been discovered so far largely by searching for
existing compounds in crystallographic databases, but there are potentially new
topological materials with desirable features that have not been synthesized.
One of the desirable features is high tunability resulted from the band
inversion with a very small direct band gap, which can be tuned by changes in
pressure or strain to induce a topological phase transition. Using density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have studied the septuple layered
AB2X4 series compounds, where A=(Ge, Sn and Pb), B=(As, Sb and Bi) and X=(Se
and Te). With the DFT thermodynamic stability validated by the already reported
compounds in these series, we predict new stable Se compounds, which are not
found in crystallographic database. Among them, we find that GeBi2Se4 and
GeSb2Se4 having a small direct band gap at the Z point are very close to a
strong topological insulator, which can be tuned by a moderate pressure to
induce the band inversion. Importantly, the topological features with the small
direct band gap are well isolated in both momentum and energy windows, which
offers high tunability for studying the topological phase transition.

In this work, we study unusual gapped topological phases where they admit
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ fractional excitations in the same manner as topologically
ordered phases, yet their ground state degeneracy depends on the local geometry
of the system. Placing such phases on 2D lattice, composed of an arbitrary
connected graph and 1D line, we find that the fusion rules of quasiparticle
excitations are described by the Laplacian of the graph and that the number of
superselection sectors is related to the kernel of the Laplacian. Based on this
analysis, we further show that the ground state degeneracy is given by
$\bigl[N\times \prod_{i}\text{gcd}(N, p_i)\bigr]^2$, where $p_i$'s are
invariant factors of the Laplacian that are greater than one and gcd stands for
the greatest common divisor. We also discuss braiding statistics between
quasiparticle excitations.

Hexagonal $AB$O$_3$ oxides ($A$, $B$ = cation) are a rich materials class for
realizing novel quantum phenomena. Their hexagonal symmetry, oxygen trigonal
bipyramid coordination and quasi-two dimensional layering give rise to
properties distinct from those of the cubic $AB$O$_3$ perovskites. As bulk
materials, most of the focus in this materials class has been on the rare earth
manganites, $R$MnO$_3$ ($R$ = rare earth); these materials display coupled
ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetic order. In this review, we focus on the
thin film manifestations of the hexagonal $AB$O$_3$ oxides. We cover the
stability of the hexagonal oxides and substrates which can be used to template
the hexagonal structure. We show how the thin film geometry not only allows for
further tuning of the bulk-stable manganites but also the realization of
metastable hexagonal oxides such as the $R$FeO$_3$ that combine
ferroelectricity with weak ferromagnetic order. The thin film geometry is a
promising platform to stabilize additional metastable hexagonal oxides to
search for predicted high-temperature superconductivity and topological phases
in this materials class.

Reliable, clean transfer and interfacing of 2D material layers is
technologically as important as their growth. Bringing both together remains a
challenge due to the vast, interconnected parameter space. We introduce a
fast-screening descriptor approach to demonstrate holistic data-driven
optimization across the entirety of process steps for the graphene-Cu model
system. We map the crystallographic dependencies of graphene chemical vapor
deposition, interfacial Cu oxidation to decouple graphene, and its dry
delamination across inverse pole figures. Their overlay enables us to identify
hitherto unexplored (168) higher index Cu orientations as overall optimal. We
show the effective preparation of such Cu orientations via epitaxial
close-space sublimation and achieve mechanical transfer with very high yield
(>95%) and quality of graphene domains, with room-temperature electron
mobilities in the range of 40000 cm$^2$/(Vs). Our approach is readily adaptable
to other descriptors and 2D materials systems, and we discuss the opportunities
of such holistic optimization.

Residual stress engineering is very widely used in the design of new advanced
lightweight materials. For metallic glasses the attention has been on
structural changes and rejuvenation processes. High energy scanning X-ray
diffraction strain mapping reveals large elastic fluctuations in metallic
glasses after deformation under triaxial compression. Transmission electron
microscopy proves that structural rejuvenation under room temperature
deformation relates to the shear band formation that closely correlates to the
underlying distribution of elastic heterogeneities. Microindentation hardness
mapping hints at an unsymmetrical hardening/softening after compression and
further reveals the competing effects of elastic fluctuations and structure
modulation. Molecular dynamics simulations provide an atomistic understanding
of the correlation between shear banding and fluctuations in the local
strain/stress heterogeneity. Thus, future focus should be given to stress
engineering and elastic heterogeneity that together with structure modulation
may allow to design metallic glasses with enhanced ductility and strain
hardening ability.

We present a theoretical study of how a spatially-varying quasiparticle
velocity in honeycomb lattices, achievable using strained graphene or in
engineered cold-atom optical lattices that have a spatial dependence to the
local tunneling amplitude, can yield the Rindler Hamiltonian embodying an
observer accelerating in Minkowski spacetime. Within this setup, a sudden
switch-on of the spatially-varying tunneling (or strain) yields a spontaneous
production of electron-hole pairs, an analogue version of the Unruh effect
characterized by the Unruh temperature. We discuss how this thermal behavior,
along with Takagi's statistics inversion, can manifest themselves in
photo-emission and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. We also calculate
the average electronic conductivity and find that it grows linearly with
frequency $\omega$, vanishing in the DC limit ($\omega\rightarrow0$). Finally,
we find that the total system energy at zero environment temperature looks like
Planck's blackbody result for photons due to the aforementioned statistics
inversion, whereas for an initial thermally excited state of fermions, the
total internal energy undergoes stimulated particle reduction.

Variational Monte Carlo is a many-body numerical method that scales well with
system size. It has been extended to study the Green function only recently by
Charlebois and Imada (2020). Here we generalize the approach to systems with
open boundary conditions in the absence of translational invariance. Removing
these constraints permits the application of embedding techniques like Cluster
perturbation theory (CPT). This allows us to solve an enduring problem in the
physics of the pseudogap in cuprate high-temperature superconductors, namely
the existence or absence of Fermi arcs in the one-band Hubbard model. We study
the behavior of the Fermi surface and of the density of states as a function of
hole doping for clusters of up to 64 sites, well beyond the reach of modern
exact diagonalization solvers. We observe that the technique reliably captures
the transition from a Mott insulator at half filling to a pseudogap, evidenced
by the formation of Fermi arcs, and finally to a metallic state at large
doping. The ability to treat large clusters with quantum cluster methods helps
to minimize potential finite size effects and enables the study of systems with
long range orders, which will help extend the reach of these already powerful
methods and provide important insights on the nature of various strongly
correlated many-electron systems, including the high-T$_c$ cuprate
superconductors.
