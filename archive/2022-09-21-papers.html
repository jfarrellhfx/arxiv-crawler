<h3>Continuum modeling of Soft Glassy Materials under shear</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09976" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09976</a>
<br>
<i>Roberto Benzi, Thibaut Divoux, Catherine Barentin, Sébastien Manneville, Mauro Sbragaglia, Federico Toschi</i>
<br>
Soft Glassy Materials (SGM) consist in dense amorphous assemblies of
colloidal particles of multiple shapes, elasticity, and interactions, which
confer upon them solid-like properties at rest. They are ubiquitously
encountered in modern engineering, including additive manufacturing, semi-solid
flow cells, dip-coating, adhesive locomotion, where they are subjected to
complex mechanical histories. Such processes often include a solid-to-liquid
transition induced by large enough shear, which results in complex transient
phenomena such as non-monotonic stress responses, i.e., stress overshoot, and
spatially heterogeneous flows, e.g., shear-banding or brittle failure. In the
present article, we propose a pedagogical introduction to a continuum model
based on a spatially-resolved fluidity approach that we recently introduced to
rationalize shear-induced yielding in SGMs. Our model, which relies upon
non-local effects, quantitatively captures salient features associated with
such complex flows, including the rate dependence of the stress overshoot, as
well as transient shear-banded flows together with nontrivial scaling laws for
fluidization times. This approach offers a versatile framework to account for
subtle effects, such as avalanche-like phenomena, or the impact of boundary
conditions, which we illustrate by including in our model the
elasto-hydrodynamic slippage of soft particles compressed against solid
surfaces.

<h3>Influence of oscillatory shear on nucleation in metallic glasses: a  molecular dynamics study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10068" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10068</a>
<br>
<i>Baoshuang Shang, Noel Jakse, Pengfei Guan, Weihua Wang, Jean-louis Barrat</i>
<br>
The process of crystal nucleation can be accelerated or retarded by
ultrasonic vibration, which is particularly attractive for the addictive
manufacture and thermoplastic forming of metallic glasses, however, the effect
and mechanism of oscillatory loading on the nucleation process are still
elusive. By using molecular dynamics simulation, the changes in the
time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curve under oscillatory external loading
are systematically investigated in two typical binary alloys. A glass forming
ability dependent response to the external loading is found, and the shortest
incubation time is insensitive to the external loading, while the corresponding
temperature can be significantly shifted. Within the framework of classical
nucleation theory, a fitting formula is proposed to describe the simulation
data quantitatively. In contrast to stationary shear, the elastic stress,
rather than the strain rate, is the key parameter to control the evolution of
TTT curve under oscillatory loading. Furthermore, the model shows that
oscillatory loading can decouple the mobility and nucleation in the deeply
supercooled liquid, hence the formation ability can be enhanced while the
nucleation is suppressed, which is particularly helpful for the forming and
manufacturing of metallic glasses.

<h3>Plasmonic quantum nonlinear Hall effect in noncentrosymmetric 2D  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10160</a>
<br>
<i>Riki Toshio, Norio Kawakami</i>
<br>
We investigate an interplay between quantum geometrical effects and surface
plasmons through surface plasmonic structures, based on an electron
hydrodynamic theory. First we demonstrate that the quantum nonlinear Hall
effect can be dramatically enhanced over a very broad range of frequency by
utilizing plasmonic resonances and near-field effects of grating gates. Under
the resonant condition, the enhancement becomes several orders of magnitude
larger than the case without the nanostructures, while the peaks of
high-harmonic plasmons expand broadly and emerge under the off-resonant
condition, leading to a remarkably broad spectrum. Furthermore, we clarify a
universal relation between the photocurrent induced by the Berry curvature
dipole and the optical absorption, which is essential for computational
material design of long-wavelength photodetectors. Next we discuss a novel
mechanism of geometrical photocurrent, which originates from an anomalous force
induced by oscillating magnetic fields and is described by the dipole moment of
orbital magnetic moments of Bloch electrons in the momentum space. Our theory
is relevant to 2D quantum materials such as layered WTe${}_2$ and twisted
bilayer graphene, thereby providing a promising route toward a novel type of
highly sensitive, broadband terahertz photodetectors.

<h3>Manipulating THz Spin Current Dynamics by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya  Interaction in Antiferromagnetic Hematite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10175" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10175</a>
<br>
<i>Hongsong Qiu, Tom Sebastian Seifert, Lin Huang, Yongjian Zhou, Zdenek Kaspar, Caihong Zhang, Jingbo Wu, Kebin Fan, Qi Zhang, Di Wu, Tobias Kampfrath, Cheng Song, Biaobing Jin, Jian Chen, Peiheng Wu</i>
<br>
An important vision of modern magnetic research is to use antiferromagnets as
controllable and active ultrafast components in spintronic devices. Hematite is
a promising model material in this respect because its pronounced
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to the coexistence of
antiferromagnetism and weak ferromagnetism. Here, we use femtosecond laser
pulses to drive terahertz spin currents from hematite into an adjacent Pt
layer. We find two contributions to the generation of the spin current with
distinctly different dynamics: the impulsive stimulated Raman scatting that
relies on the antiferromagnetic order and the ultrafast spin Seebeck effect
that relies on the net magnetization. The total THz spin current dynamics can
thus be manipulated by a medium-strength magnetic field. The controllability of
the THz spin current achieved in hematite opens the pathway toward controlling
the exact spin current dynamics from ultrafast antiferromagnetic spin sources.

<h3>Crowding-Enhanced Diffusion: An Exact Theory for Highly Entangled  Self-Propelled Stiff Filaments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10237" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10237</a>
<br>
<i>Suvendu Mandal, Christina Kurzthaler, Thomas Franosch, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<br>
We study a strongly interacting crowded system of self-propelled stiff
filaments by event-driven Brownian dynamics simulations and an analytical
theory to elucidate the intricate interplay of crowding and self-propulsion. We
find a remarkable increase of the effective diffusivity upon increasing the
filament number density by more than one order of magnitude. This
counter-intuitive 'crowded is faster' behavior can be rationalized by extending
the concept of a confining tube pioneered by Doi and Edwards for highly
entangled crowded, passive to active systems. We predict a scaling theory for
the effective diffusivity as a function of the P\'eclet number and the filament
number density. Subsequently, we show that an exact expression derived for a
single self-propelled filament with motility parameters as input can predict
the non-trivial spatiotemporal dynamics over the entire range of length and
time scales. In particular, our theory captures short-time diffusion, directed
swimming motion at intermediate times, and the transition to complete
orientational relaxation at long times.

<h3>Weakly interacting Bose gas with two-body losses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10427" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10427</a>
<br>
<i>Chang Liu, Zhe-Yu Shi, Ce Wang</i>
<br>
We study the many-body dynamics of weakly interacting Bose gases with
two-particle losses. We show that both the two-body interactions and losses in
atomic gases may be tuned by controlling the inelastic scattering process
between atoms by an optical Feshbach resonance. Interestingly, the low-energy
behavior of the scattering amplitude is governed by a single parameter, i.e.
the complex $s$-wave scattering length $a_c$. The many-body dynamics are thus
described by a Lindblad master equation with complex scattering length. We
solve this equation by applying the Bogoliubov approximation in analogy to the
closed systems. Various peculiar dynamical properties are discovered, some of
them may be regarded as the dissipative counterparts of the celebrated results
in closed Bose gases. For example, we show that the next-order correction to
the mean-field particle decay rate is to the order of $|n a_c^{3}|^{1/2}$,
which is an analogy of the Lee-Huang-Yang correction of Bose gases. It is also
found that there exists a dynamical symmetry of the symplectic group
Sp$(4,\mathbb{C})$ in the quadratic Bogoliubov master equation, which is an
analogy of the SU(1,1) dynamical symmetry of the corresponding closed system.
We further confirmed the validity of the Bogoliubov approximation by comparing
its results with a full numerical calculation in a double-well toy model.
Generalizations of other alternative approaches such as the dissipative version
of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and hydrodynamic theory are also discussed in
the last.

<h3>Surface termination dependence of electronic and optical properties in  Ti$_2$CO$_2$ MXene monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10487" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10487</a>
<br>
<i>Zafer Kandemir, Engin Torun, Fulvio Paleari, Celal Yelgel, Cem Sevik</i>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) MXenes are a rapid growing family of 2D materials with
rich physical and chemical properties where their surface termination plays an
essential role. Among the various 2D MXenes, functionalization of the
Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ phase with oxygen (O) atoms makes them attractive for
optoelectronic applications due to their optical gap residing in the infrared
or visible region. In this manuscript, we theoretically investigate the
electronic and optical properties of four different O-atom-functionalized
Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ MXene monolayers using state-of-the-art, first-principles
techniques. In particular, we calculate the quasiparticle corrections on top of
density functional theory (DFT) at the GW level and the exciton-dominated
optical spectra by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) also at finite
momentum. We find that all but one of the monolayer models are indirect band
gap semiconductors where quasiparticle corrections are very important ($\sim 1$
eV). The optical spectra are instead dominated by direct and indirect excitons
with large binding energies (between $0.5$ and $1$ eV). Most direct excitons
lie above $1.5$ eV, while the indirect ones are below: therefore, we conclude
that Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ should display strong absorption in the visible region,
but phonon-assisted emission in the infrared. Our work thus reveals the
potential usage of surface terminations to tune the optical and electronic
properties of Ti$_{n}$C$_{n-1}$ MXene monolayers, while emphasizing the pivotal
role of many-body effects beyond DFT to obtain accurate prediction for these
systems.

<h3>Characteristics of a Titanium Manganese redox flow battery based on  Comsol</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09904" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09904</a>
<br>
<i>Anupam Saha, Shinthia Binte Eskender</i>
<br>
A simulation model and design of Titanium Manganese Redox Flow Battery
(TMRFB) is proposed to study the distribution of dissociation rate,
overpotential, current density, and electrode potential. TMRFB is one of the
most promising new energy storages because of its high capacity and
eco-friendly characteristics in the current condition of energy scarcity and
environmental pollution. Moreover, Mn-based flow batteries are gaining
popularity due to their inexpensive cost and high energy density in lieu of all
vanadium redox flow batteries which are expensive. This research shows that the
surface dissociation rate of Ti4+/ Ti3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ ions are higher at the
membrane and lower at the inlet where the velocity of the electrolyte flow is
higher; Furthermore, our work reveals that when the thickness of the electrode
is compressed from 4.5 mm to 3 mm, overpotential reduces whereas current
density and electrode potential increases. The COMSOL Multiphysics software is
used to solve the model's equations using the finite element approach. From the
dissociation rate it is concluded that less potential is required at the
membrane for the oxidation reduction reaction and with optimized electrolyte
flow rate battery performance can be improved. Thus, electrode compression
increases conductivity and battery performance.

<h3>Pressure-temperature phase diagram of CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_4$As$_4$  for $x$=0.024</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09966" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09966</a>
<br>
<i>Li Xiang, Mingyu Xu, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield</i>
<br>
Resistance measurements on single crystals of CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_4$As$_4$
($x$ = 0.024) were performed under hydrostatic pressure up to 5.15 GPa. The
pressure dependence of the magnetic and superconducting transition temperatures
and that of the superconducting upper critical field are reported. Our results
show that upon increasing pressure, the magnetic transition temperature $T_{N}$
is suppressed, whereas the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$ first
increases and then decreases, exhibiting a maximum at a pressure $p_c$
corresponding to the intersection of the $T_{N}$($p$) and $T_{c}$($p$) lines.
In addition, a minimum in the normalized slope of the superconducting upper
critical field as well as a change in the pressure dependence of the inferred
superconducting coherence length are observed at $p_c$, suggesting a difference
in the Fermi surface of the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. Finally,
CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ ($x$ = 0.024) likely goes through a
half-collapsed-tetragonal phase transition at $\sim$ 4.3 GPa, further
demonstrating that the half-collapsed-tetragonal transition pressure in the
CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ system is relatively insensitive to transition metal
substitution.

<h3>Surface state evolution induced by magnetic order in axion insulator  candidate EuIn2As2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09972" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09972</a>
<br>
<i>Mingda Gong, Divyanshi Sar, Joel Friedman, Dariusz Kaczorowski, S. Abdel Razek, Wei-Cheng Lee, Pegor Aynajian</i>
<br>
Gapping of Dirac surface states through time reversal symmetry breaking may
realize the axion insulator state in condensed matter. Despite tremendous
efforts, only a few material systems fall in this category of intrinsic
magnetic topological insulators (TI). Recent theoretical calculations proposed
the antiferromagnetic EuIn$_2$As$_2$ to be a topologically non-trivial magnetic
insulator with gapped surface states. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy
and spectroscopy (STM/STS) complemented with density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations and modelling to probe the surface electronic states in
EuIn$_2$As$_2$. We find a spin-orbit induced bulk gap of ~120 meV located only
a few meV above the Fermi energy, within which topological surface states
reside. Temperature dependent measurements provide evidence of the partial
gapping (~40 meV) of the surface states at low temperatures below the AFM
order, which decreases with increasing temperature but remains finite above
$T_N$

<h3>Redox-controlled conductance of polyoxometalate molecular junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09974</a>
<br>
<i>Cécile Huez, David Guérin, Stéphane Lenfant, Florence Volatron, Michel Calame, Mickael L. Perrin, Anna Proust, Dominique Vuillaume</i>
<br>
We demonstrate the reversible in situ photoreduction of molecular junctions
of phosphomolybdate [PMo12O40]3- monolayer self-assembled on flat gold
electrodes, connected by the tip of a conductive atomic force microscope. The
conductance of the one electron reduced [PMo12O40]4- molecular junction is
increased by ca. 10, this open-shell state is stable in the junction in air at
room temperature. The analysis of a large current-voltage dataset by
unsupervised machine learning and clustering algorithms reveals that the
electron transport in the pristine phosphomolybdate junctions leads to
symmetric current-voltage curves, controlled by the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) at 0.6 - 0.7 eV above the Fermi energy with ca. 25% of the
junctions having a better electronic coupling to the electrodes than the main
part of the dataset. This analysis also shows that a small fraction (ca. 18% of
the dataset) of the molecules is already reduced. The UV light in situ
photoreduced phosphomolybdate junctions are systematically featuring slightly
asymmetric current - voltage behaviors, which is ascribed to electron transport
mediated by the single occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) nearly at resonance
with the Fermi energy of the electrode and by a closely located single
unoccupied molecular orbital (SUMO) at ca. 0.3 eV above the SOMO with a weak
electronic coupling to the electrodes (ca. 50% of the dataset) or at ca. 0.4 eV
but with a better electrode coupling (ca. 50% of the dataset). These results
shed lights to the electronic properties of reversible switchable redox
polyoxometalates, a key point for potential applications in nanoelectronic
devices.

<h3>Light-harvesting enhanced by quantum ratchet states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09978" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09978</a>
<br>
<i>Nicholas Werren, Erik Gauger, Will Brown</i>
<br>
We consider bio-inspired ring systems as photovoltaic circuits to explore the
advantage of `optical ratcheting', a process whereby the arrangement of coupled
optical dipoles enables delocalised excitonic states that are protected against
radiative decay whilst permitting the absorption of further photons. We explore
how the performance of a ratcheting antenna scales with system size when
excitons are incoherently or coherently extracted from the antenna to an
associated trap site. In both instances we also move to the polaron frame in
order to more closely model realistic systems where the coupling to vibrational
modes can generally be assumed to be strong. We find a multifaceted and nuanced
dependence of the predicted performance on an interplay between geometrical
arrangement, extraction mechanism, and vibrational coupling strength. Certain
regimes support substantial performance improvements in the power extracted per
site.

<h3>Quantum Melting of Spin-1 Dimer Solid Induced by Inter-chain Couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09986</a>
<br>
<i>Yi Xu, Tianfu Fu, Juraj Hasik, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</i>
<br>
Dimerized valence bond solids appear naturally in spin-1/2 systems on
bipartite lattices, with the geometric frustrations playing a key role both in
their stability and the eventual `melting' due to quantum fluctuations. Here,
we ask the question of the stability of such dimerized solids in spin-1
systems, taking the anisotropic square lattice with bilinear and biquadratic
spin-spin interactions as a paradigmatic model. The lattice can be viewed as a
set of coupled spin-1 chains, which in the limit of vanishing inter-chain
coupling are known to possess a stable dimer phase. We study this model using
the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and infinite projected
entangled-pair states (iPEPS) techniques, supplemented by the analytical
mean-field and linear flavor wave theory calculations. While the latter
predicts the dimer phase to remain stable up to a reasonably large
interchain-to-intrachain coupling ratio $r \lesssim 0.6$, the DMRG and iPEPS
find that the dimer solid melts for much weaker interchain coupling not
exceeding $r\lesssim 0.15$. We find the transition into a magnetically ordered
state to be first order, manifested by a hysteresis and order parameter jump,
precluding the deconfined quantum critical scenario. The apparent lack of
stability of dimerized phases in 2D spin-1 systems is indicative of strong
quantum fluctuations that melt the dimer solid.

<br>
As a common physical phenomenon in nature, liquid-gas coexistence(LGC) is
generally associated with finite temperature and long-range interaction. Here
we report a new mechanism in engineering LGC well beyond the traditional frame,
i.e., for ground state bosons under contact interactions. It is facilitated by
the mismatch of spin polarization, dubbed "spin twist", between single-particle
and interaction channels of bosons with spin degree of freedom. Such spin twist
creates an effective repulsion for low-density bosons and uniquely stabilizes
the gas phase, thereby enabling LGC in the presence of a quantum droplet with
much larger density. We have demonstrated the scheme taking the example of
binary bosons subject to Rabi coupling and magnetic detuning. The liquid-gas
transition and coexistence therein can be conveniently tuned by single-particle
potentials and spin-dependent interactions. To characterize LGC, we have shown
the phase separation of liquid and gas in a trap and identified two universal
exponents for the critical behavior of their densities. The spin twist scheme
for LGC can be generalized to a wide class of quantum systems with competing
single-particle and interaction orders.

<h3>Chiral and nodal superconductors in t-J model with valley contrasting  flux on triangular moiré lattice</h3>

<i>Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<br>
Recent experimental progresses have made it possible to simulate spin 1/2
Hubbard model on triangular lattice in moir\'e materials formed by transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayer or homobilayer. In twisted TMD
homobilayer, a vertical electric field can induce a valley contrasting flux in
the hopping term. In this paper we study possible superconductors from a t-J
model with valley contrasting flux $\Phi$ using the slave boson mean field
theory. We obtain a phase diagram with doping $x$ and $\Phi$. A finite $\Phi$
breaks spin rotation symmetry and the pairing symmetry is a superposition of
spin singlet $d-id$ and spin triplet $p+ip$. There are two topological phase
transitions when tuning $\Phi$ from $0$ to $\pi$, with three Dirac nodes at one
transition and one single Dirac node at the other transition. We also discuss
the effects of van Hove singularity and a three-site correlated hopping term on
the pairing strength. Lastly, we demonstrate that a small anisotropy term
breaking the $C_3$ rotation can lead to a time reversal invariant nodal
superconductor connected to the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductor on square lattice.

<h3>Small atoms fall into bulk from non-close-packed surfaces?</h3>

Surface rippling has been observed when atoms of $X$ and $A$ are mixed on the
$A$ substrate surface. The rippling amplitude has been estimated using hard
sphere models. We present a gedanken experiment predicting a penetration of
small atoms into bulk through the (100) surface. To understand how the
electronic effects alter this picture, we investigate the surface rippling of
$X/A(100)$ from first-principles, assuming $X=$ H to Bi except for noble gases
and $A=$ Cu, Ag, and Au. We show that the small atoms (such as H, C, N, O and
F) attract electrons from the substrate due to the large electronegativity,
which prevent them from passing through the void in the (100) surface. The
behaviors of small atoms are further explored by studying lateral displacements
of the top layer in the $A$ substrate and a formation of the $X$ dimer above,
below, and across the top layer. The present work provides an example to
understand when atoms are not hard spheres.

<h3>Dispersive cavity-mediated quantum gate between driven dot-donor nuclear  spins</h3>

<br>
Nuclear spins show exceptionally long coherence times but the underlying good
isolation from their environment is a challenge when it comes to controlling
nuclear spin qubits. A particular difficulty, not only for nuclear spin qubits,
is the realization of two-qubit gates between distant qubits. Recently, strong
coupling between an electron spin and microwave resonator photons [1,2] as well
as a microwave resonator mediated coupling between two electron spins both in
the resonant [3] and the dispersive [4] regime have been reported and, thus, a
microwave resonator mediated electron spin two qubit gate [5] seems to be in
reach. Inspired by these findings, we theoretically investigate the interaction
of a microwave resonator with a hybrid quantum dot-donor (QDD) system
consisting of a gate defined Si QD and a laterally displaced $^{31}$P
phosphorous donor atom implanted in the Si host material. We find that driving
the QDD system allows to compensate the frequency mismatch between the donor
nuclear spin splitting in the MHz regime and typical superconducting resonator
frequencies in the GHz regime, and also enables an effective nuclear
spin-photon coupling. While we expect this coupling to be weak, we predict that
coupling the nuclear spins of two distant QDD systems dispersively to the
microwave resonator allows the implementation of a resonator mediated nuclear
spin two-qubit $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate with a gate fidelity approaching
$95\%$.

<h3>The structure of networks that evolve under a combination of growth, via  node addition and random attachment, and contraction, via random node  deletion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10027" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10027</a>
<br>
<i>Barak Budnick, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav</i>
<br>
We present analytical results for the emerging structure of networks that
evolve via a combination of growth (by node addition and random attachment) and
contraction (by random node deletion). To this end we consider a network model
in which at each time step a node addition and random attachment step takes
place with probability $P_{add}$ and a random node deletion step takes place
with probability $P_{del}=1-P_{add}$. The balance between the growth and
contraction processes is captured by the parameter $\eta=P_{add}-P_{del}$. The
case of pure network growth is described by $\eta=1$. In case that $0<\eta<1$
the rate of node addition exceeds the rate of node deletion and the overall
process is of network growth. In the opposite case, where $-1<\eta<0$, the
overall process is of network contraction, while in the special case of
$\eta=0$ the expected size of the network remains fixed, apart from
fluctuations. Using the master equation we obtain a closed form expression for
the time dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. The degree distribution
$P_t(k)$ includes a term that depends on the initial degree distribution
$P_0(k)$, which decays as time evolves, and an asymptotic distribution
$P_{st}(k)$. In the case of pure network growth ($\eta=1$) the asymptotic
distribution $P_{st}(k)$ follows an exponential distribution, while for
$-1<\eta<1$ it consists of a sum of Poisson-like terms and exhibits a
Poisson-like tail. In the case of overall network growth ($0 < \eta < 1$) the
degree distribution $P_t(k)$ eventually converges to $P_{st}(k)$. In the case
of overall network contraction ($-1 < \eta < 0$) we identify two different
regimes. For $-1/3 < \eta < 0$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ quickly
converges towards $P_{st}(k)$. In contrast, for $-1 < \eta < -1/3$ the
convergence of $P_t(k)$ is initially very slow and it gets closer to
$P_{st}(k)$ only shortly before the network vanishes.

<br>
The 2+1d continuum Lifshitz theory of a free compact scalar field plays a
prominent role in a variety of quantum systems in condensed matter physics and
high energy physics. It is known that in compact space, it has an infinite
ground state degeneracy. In order to understand this theory better, we consider
two candidate lattice regularizations of it using the modified Villain
formalism. We show that these two lattice theories have significantly different
global symmetries (including a dipole global symmetry), anomalies, ground state
degeneracies, and dualities. In particular, one of them is self-dual. Given
these theories and their global symmetries, we can couple them to corresponding
gauge theories. These are two different $U(1)$ tensor gauge theories. The
resulting models have excitations with restricted mobility, i.e., fractons.
Finally, we give an exact lattice realization of the fracton/lineon-elasticity
dualities for the Lifshitz theory, scalar and vector charge gauge theories.

<h3>Multi band Fermi surface in 1T-VSe2 and its implication for charge  density wave phase</h3>

Here, our angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment reveled that
the surface band structure of the 1T-VSe2 host electronic states that was not
predicted or probed before. Earlier claims to support charge density wave phase
can be all explained in terms of these new findings. Its Fermi surface found to
be not gaped at any point of the Brillouin zone and warping effect on the
electronic structure, attributed to the lattice distortion previously, is due
to the different dispersion of the multiple bands. Based on these new findings
and interpretations, charge density wave induced modification on the electronic
structure of 1T-VSe2 needs to be reconstructed in the future studies.

Although classifying topological quantum phases have attracted great
interests, the absence of local order parameter generically makes it
challenging to detect a topological phase transition from experimental data.
Recent advances in machine learning algorithms enable physicists to analyze
experimental data with unprecedented high sensitivities, and identify quantum
phases even in the presence of unavoidable noises. Here, we report a successful
identification of topological phase transitions using a deep convolutional
neural network trained with low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) experimental data
obtained in a symmetry-protected topological system of spin-orbit-coupled
fermions. We apply the trained network to unseen data to map out a whole phase
diagram, which \blue{predicts the positions of the two topological phase
transitions} that are consistent with the results obtained by using the
conventional method on higher SNR data. By visualizing the filters and
post-convolutional results of the convolutional layer, \blue{we further find
that the CNN uses the same information to make the classification in the system
as the conventional analysis, namely spin imbalance, but with an advantage
concerning SNR.} Our work highlights the potential of machine learning
techniques to be used in various quantum systems.

<h3>Orthorhombic and triclinic modifications of the arsenate Cu4O(AsO4)2 and  isotypic phosphates Cu4O(PO4)2: strongly frustrated antiferromagnetics</h3>

<i>L.M. Volkova</i>
<br>
A structural-magnetic models of the orthorhombic and triclinic modifications
of the arsenates Cu4O(AsO4)2 and isotypic phosphates Cu4O(PO4)2 has been built
and analyzed. Their base elements are the complicated ribbons composed of
antiferromagnetic Cu4 tetrahedra. Structurally, these tetrahedra have no shared
copper atoms; however, there are strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) and
ferromagnetic (FM) couplings between them, both within the complicated ribbons
and between them. It has been established that both modifications are strongly
frustrated 3-D antiferromagnetics due to competition between the nearest AFM
interactions along the edges of the Cu4 tetrahedra and competition between
interactions and a multiplicity of long-range secondary AFM and FM
interactions. Additionally, a large number of weaker long-range interactions
are competing among each other. However, there is a possibility of the ordering
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the centrosymmetric orthorhombic
modification (Pnma), because two of the three types of magnetic ions, Cu1 and
Cu3, are in the partial position 4c, where the ions are not related by the
inversion center. In the triclinic modification (P -1) of Cu4O(As(P)O4)2, all
four copper ions are in the centrosymmetric equivalent position 2i, which
prevents DM interactions. This centrosymmetry will allow magnetic interactions
in the triclinic modification of Cu4O(As(P)O4)2 to be still frustrated at lower
temperature. It is possible that the triclinic modification of these compounds
is a quantum spin liquid.

<i>Jacob Manalo, Daniel Miravet, Pawel Hawrylak</i>
<br>
We present here the steps enabling the microscopic design of a topologically
protected singlet-triplet qubit in an InAsP quantum dot array embedded in an
InP nanowire. The qubit is constructed with two Haldane spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
quasiparticles in a synthetic spin one chain. The qubit is described by a
two-leg multi-orbital Hubbard Kanamori (HK) model with parameters obtained from
the microscopic calculations of up to eight electrons in a single and double
quantum dot. In this HK model describing long arrays of quantum dots, using
both exact diagonalization and matrix product state (MPS) tools, we demonstrate
a four-fold quasidegenerate ground state separated from excited states by a
finite energy gap similar to a Heisenberg spin-1 chain in the Haldane phase. We
demonstrate the existence of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quasiparticles at the edges of
the chain by observing the magnetic field dependence of the low energy spectrum
as a function of applied magnetic field. The applied magnetic field also
isolates the singlet and $S^z=0$ triplet states from the other triplet
components allowing these states to serve as a qubit basis. Most importantly,
the regions in parameter space where the low energy spectrum of the
multi-orbital Hubbard chain yields a Heisenberg spin-1 chain spectrum are
mapped out. Due to the finite energy gap, this qubit has the potential to be
protected against perturbations.

<h3>A first-principles investigation of the linear thermal expansion  coefficients of BeF$_2$: Giant thermal expansion</h3>

<i>Chee Kwan Gan, Abdullah I. Al-Sharif, Ammar Al-Shorman, Abdallah Qteish</i>
<br>
We present the results of a theoretical investigation of the linear thermal
expansion coefficients (TECs) of BeF$_2$, within a direct Gruneisen formalism
where symmetry-preserving deformations are employed. The required physical
quantities such as the optimized crystal structures, elastic constants, mode
Gruneisen parameters, and phonon density of states are calculated from
first-principles. BeF$_2$ shows an extensive polymorphism at low pressures, and
the lowest energy phases [$\alpha$-cristobalite with space group (SG) P$4_1 2_1
2$ and its similar phase with SG P$4_3 2_1 2$] are considered in addition to
the experimentally observed $\alpha$-quartz phase. For benchmarking purposes,
similar calculations are performed for the rutile phase of ZnF$_2$, where the
volumetric TEC ($\alpha_v$), derived from the calculated linear TECs along the
$a$ ($\alpha_a$) and $c$ ($\alpha_c$) directions, is in very good agreement
with experimental data and previous theoretical results. For the considered
phases of BeF$_2$, we do not find any negative thermal expansion (NTE). However
we observe diverse thermal properties for the distinct phases. The linear TECs
are very large, especially $\alpha_c$ of the $\alpha$-cristobalite phase and
its similar phase, leading to giant $\alpha_v$ ($\sim 175 \times 10^{-6} {\rm
K}^{-1}$ at 300 K). The giant $\alpha_v$ arises from large Gruneisen parameters
of low-frequency phonon modes, and the C13 elastic constant that is negatively
signed and large in magnitude for the $\alpha$-cristobalite phase. The elastic
constants, high-frequency dielectric constants, Born effective charge tensors,
and thermal properties of the above phases of BeF$_2$ are reported for the
first time and hence serve as predictions.

Graphene layers placed on SrTiO3 single-crystal substrates were investigated
using temperature-dependent confocal Raman spectroscopy. This approach
successfully resolved distinct Raman modes of graphene that are often
untraceable in conventional measurements due to the strong Raman scattering
background of SrTiO3. Information on defects and strain states was obtained for
a few graphene/SrTiO3 samples that were synthesized by different techniques.
This confocal Raman spectroscopic approach can shed light on the investigation
of not only this graphene/SrTiO3 system but also various two-dimensional
layered materials whose Raman modes interfere with their substrates.

<h3>Observation of the Surface Layer of Lithium Metal using In Situ  Spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
We have investigated the surface of lithium metal using x-ray photoemission
spectroscopy and optical spectroscopic ellipsometry. Even if we prepare the
surface of lithium metal rigorously by chemical cleaning and mechanical
polishing inside a glovebox, both spectroscopic investigations show the
existence of a few tens of nanometer-thick surface layers, consisting of
lithium oxides and lithium carbonates. When lithium metal is exposed to room
air (~50% moisture), in situ real-time monitoring of optical spectra indicates
that the surface layer grows at a rate of approximately 24 nm/min, presumably
driven by an interface-controlled process. Our results hint that
surface-layer-free lithium metals are formidable to achieve by a simple
cleaning/polishing method, suggesting that the initial interface between
lithium metal electrodes and solid-state electrolytes in fabricated lithium
metal batteries can differ from an ideal lithium/electrolyte contact.

<i>H. Geng, J. Y. Wei, M. H. Zou, L. Sheng, Wei Chen, D. Y. Xing</i>
<br>
The pursuit of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in various physical
systems is of great research interest. Compared with recent progress in
non-electronic systems, the implementation of the NHSE in condensed matter
physics remains elusive. Here, we show that the NHSE can be engineered in the
mesoscopic heterojunctions (system plus reservoir) in which electrons in two
channels of the system moving towards each other have asymmetric coupling to
those of the reservoir. This makes electrons in the system moving forward and
in the opposite direction have unequal lifetimes, and so gives rise to a
point-gap spectral topology. Accordingly, the electron eigenstates exhibit NHSE
under the open boundary condition, consistent with the description of the
generalized Brillouin zone. Such a reservoir-engineered NHSE visibly manifests
itself as the nonreciprocal charge current that can be probed by the standard
transport measurements. Further, we generalize the scenario to the
spin-resolved NHSE, which can be probed by the nonreciprocal spin transport.
Our work opens a new research avenue for implementing and detecting the NHSE in
electronic mesoscopic systems, which will lead to interesting device
applications.

Ultrafast optical spectroscopy was used to investigate the ultrafast

of temperature and fluence. Our results reveal (i) the opening of a narrow

temperature T*~100 K, (ii) the coupling of coherent phonon modes with Kondo
effect and magnetic orders, leading to the frequencies anomaly at the
characteristic temperatures, and (iii) a possible photoinduced nonthermal phase
transition. Our observations thus shed light on the hybridization dynamics and
magnetic orders in heavy fermion systems.

<br>
It is well-known that the thermal fluctuation in magnets will induce a
thermodynamical phase transitions between magnetic ordered and paramagnetic
phases. Here we show that it could also drive topological transitions for
magnons in two-dimensional collinear antiferromagnets with sublattice
asymmetries by increasing temperatures, attributed to the magnon-magnon
interactions. We present the phase diagram and showcase that the topological
trivial magnon bands at low temperatures will experience topological
transitions at a critical temperature and exhibit Chern insulating phase at
higher temperatures. These temperature driven topological transitions originate
from band closing and reopening at $\Gamma$ or K points, accompanied by a
magnon chirality switch, indicating that our proposal is within the
experimental approach via magneto-optical effect, polarized neutral scattering
or chirality-selective pumping.

<br>
In many published articles isobaric behavior in DAC chambers has been
reported On the other hand, a clear isochoric behavior in the chambers were
reported. Thus, Isochoric or isobaric condition remain an open question. In
isochoric condition, upon increasing the temperature, at each pressure, the
examined sample and the PTM both are subject to increases of their volumes
which is suppressed by the chamber finite volume, provoking an increase in the
thermal pressure over the whole system. For this reason, the pressure scale
reported in DAC experiments do not represent the actual pressure experienced by
the sample in the cell. The different response of the PTMs to P,T changes is
the reason for the variety of melting curves reported in the literature. It is
concluded that the pressure scale in DAC experiments need a correction taking
in to account the thermal pressure shift. Trusting the first principals DFT- Z
methodology it is shown that the melting curve derived by this method should
serve as an anchor for the pressure scale correction.

The spin-orbit-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates have been realized in
the experiment. We study spin-orbit-coupled spinor gap solitons in this
experimentally realizable system with an optical lattice. The spin-dependent
parity symmetry of the spin-orbit coupling plays an important role in
properties of gap solitons. Two families of solitons with opposite
spin-dependent parity are found. Using an approximating model by replacing the
optical lattice with a Harmonic trap, we demonstrate the physical origination
of these two families. For a large negative quadratic Zeeman shift, we also
find a type of gap solitons that spontaneously breaks the spin-dependent parity
symmetry due to the ferromagnetic spinor interactions.

<br>
Recent studies have shown that there are two types of topological quadrupolar
semimetals. One is the quadrupolar bulk semimetal, which is a conventional
semimetal with gapless nodes in the bulk spectrum. The other type is named the
quadrupolar surface semimetal, possessing a gapped bulk but gapless nodes on
the surface spectrum. There have been many experiments on the implementation of
quadrupolar bulk semimetals. However, the quadrupolar surface semimetal has
never been realized. Here we report on the experimental realization of the
quadrupolar surface semimetal in the circuit system. To highlight the
properties of the quadrupolar surface semimetal, we also prepare a quadrupolar
bulk semimetal in the circuit as a contrast. It has been demonstrated that the
quadrupolar surface semimetal has a bulk band gap, but two gapless nodes appear
on the surfaces. Also, the electrons not only concentrate on the hinges but
also on the corresponding surfaces. Our studies provide novel ways to control
electrical signals and may have potential applications in the field of
intergraded circuit design.

<h3>Effect of Co Substitution on Ferrimagnetic Heusler compound Mn3Ga</h3>

<br>
Effect of Co substitution on Mn$_3$Ga is investigated using first-principles
study for structural and magnetic properties. Without Co, ferrimagnetic Heusler
compound Mn3Ga is in tetragonal phase. With Co substitution, depending on Co
concentration (x) Mn$_3$Ga prefers tetragonal (cubic) phase when x \leq 0.5 (x
\geq 0.5). Ferrimagnetism is robust regardless of x in both phases. While
magnetic moments of two Mn do not vary significantly with x, Co magnetic moment
in two phases exhibit different behaviors, leading to distinct features in
total magnetic moment (M_{tot}). When x \leq 0.5, in tetragonal phase, Co
magnetic moment is vanishingly small, resulting in a decrease of M_{tot} with
x. In contrast, when x \geq 0.5, in cubic phase, Co magnetic moment is roughly
1$\mu_B$, which is responsible for an increase of Mtot. Electronic structure is
analyzed with partial density of states for various x. To elucidate the
counterintuitively small Co moment, the magnetic exchange interaction is
investigated where exchange coefficient between Co and Mn is much smaller in x
\leq 0.5 case than x \geq 0.5 one.

The variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods are used to
calculate the correlation energy of the paramagnetic three-dimensional

functions, and finite-size errors are removed using twist-averaged boundary
conditions and extrapolation of the energy per particle to the thermodynamic
limit of infinite system size. Our correlation energies in the thermodynamic
limit are lower (i.e., more negative, and therefore more accurate according to
the variational principle) than previous results, and can be used for the
parameterization of density functionals to be applied to high-density systems.

<h3>Hole spin manipulation in inhomogeneous and non-separable electric  fields</h3>

<br>
The usual models for electrical spin manipulation in semiconductor quantum
dots assume that the confinement potential is separable in the three spatial
dimensions and that the AC drive field is homogeneous. However, the electric
field induced by the gates in quantum dot devices is not fully separable and
displays significant inhomogeneities. Here, we address the electrical
manipulation of hole spins in semiconductor heterostructures subject to
inhomogeneous vertical electric fields and/or in-plane AC electric fields. We
consider Ge quantum dots electrically confined in a Ge/GeSi quantum well as an
illustration. We show that the lack of separability between the vertical and
in-plane motions of the hole gives rise to an additional spin-orbit coupling
mechanism (beyond the usual linear and cubic in momentum Rashba terms) that
modulates the principal axes of the hole gyromagnetic g-matrix. This
non-separability mechanism can be of the same order of magnitude as Rashba-type
interactions, and enables spin manipulation when the magnetic field is applied
in the plane of the heterostructure even when the dot is symmetric
(disk-shaped). More generally, we show that Rabi oscillations in strongly
patterned electric fields harness a variety of g-factor modulations. We discuss
the implications for the design, modeling and understanding of hole spin qubit
devices.

<h3>Neutron scattering from fragmented frustrated magnets</h3>

<br>
The fragmentation description is used to analyse calculated neutron
scattering intensities from kagom\'e ice and spin ice systems. The
longitudinal, transverse and harmonic fragments produce independent
contributions to the neutron scattering intensity. This framework is used to
analyse the ordering due to quantum fluctuations in the topologically
constrained phase of kagom\'e ice and the monopole crystal phase of spin ice.
Here, quantum fluctuations are restricted to the transverse fragment and they
drive the system into a double-$q$ structure in which longitudinal and
transverse fragments have a different ordering wave vector. The intensity
reduction of the Bragg peaks for the transverse fragments, compared with known
classical limits can be used as a diagnostic tool for quantum fluctuations.
Published quantum Monte Carlo data for spin ice in a $[111]$ field are
consistent with the proposed protocol.

<h3>Excitonic effects in time-dependent density functional theory from zeros  of the density response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10257</a>
<br>
<i>D. R. Gulevich, Ya. V. Zhumagulov, V. Kozin, I. V. Tokatly</i>
<br>
We show that the analytic structure of the dynamical xc kernels of
semiconductors and insulators can be sensed in terms of its poles which mark
physically relevant frequencies of the system where the counter-phase motion of
discrete collective excitations occurs: if excited, the collective modes
counterbalance each other, making the system to exhibit none at all or
extremely weak density response. This property can be employed to construct
simple and practically relevant approximations of the dynamical xc kernel for
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Such kernels have simple
analytic structure, are able to reproduce dominant excitonic features of the
absorption spectra of monolayer semiconductors and bulk solids, and promise
high potential for future uses in efficient real-time calculations with TDDFT.

<h3>Frontiers, challenges, and solutions in modeling of swift heavy ion  effects in materials</h3>

<br>
<i>N. Medvedev, A.E. Volkov, R. Rymzhanov, F. Akhmetov, S. Gorbunov, R. Voronkov, P. Babaev</i>
<br>
Since a few breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of the effects of
swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating in the electronic stopping regime in the
matter have been achieved in the last decade, it motivated us to review the
state-of-the-art approaches in the modeling of SHI effects. The SHI track
kinetics occurs via several well-separated stages: from attoseconds in
ion-impact ionization depositing energy in a target, to femtoseconds of
electron transport and hole cascades, to picoseconds of lattice excitation and
response, to nanoseconds of atomic relaxation, and even longer macroscopic
reaction. Each stage requires its own approaches for quantitative description.
We discuss that understanding the links between the stages makes it possible to
describe the entire track kinetics within a multiscale model without fitting
procedures. The review focuses on the underlying physical mechanisms of each
process, the dominant effects they produce, and the limitations of the existing
approaches as well as various numerical techniques implementing these models.
It provides an overview of ab-initio-based modeling of the evolution of the
electronic properties; Monte Carlo simulations of nonequilibrium electronic
transport; molecular dynamics modeling of atomic reaction on the surface and in
the bulk; kinetic Mote Carlo of atomic defect kinetics; finite-difference
methods of tracks interaction with chemical solvents describing etching
kinetics. We outline the modern methods that couple these approaches into
multiscale multidisciplinary models and point to their bottlenecks, strengths,
and weaknesses. The analysis is accompanied by examples of important results
improving the understanding of track formation in various materials.
Summarizing the most recent advances in the field of the track formation
process, the review delivers a comprehensive picture and detailed understanding
of the phenomena.

<h3>Spin current driven by ultrafast magnetization of FeRh</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10290</a>
<br>
<i>Kyuhwe Kang, Hiroki Omura, Oukjae Lee, Kyung-Jin Lee, Hyun-Woo Lee, Tomoyasu Taniyama, Gyung-Min Choi</i>
<br>
Laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization is an important phenomenon that
probes arguably ultimate limits of the angular momentum dynamics in solid.
Unfortunately, many aspects of the dynamics remain unclear except that the
demagnetization transfers the angular momentum eventually to the lattice. In
particular, roles of electron-carried spin current are debated. Here we
experimentally probe the spin current in the opposite phenomenon, i.e.,
laser-induced ultrafast magnetization of FeRh, where the laser pump pulse
initiates the angular momentum build-up rather than its dissipation. Using the
time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we directly measure the
ultrafast-magnetization-driven spin current in a FeRh/Cu heterostructure.
Strong correlation between the spin current and the net magnetization change
rate of FeRh is found even though the spin filter effect is negligible in this
opposite process. This result implies that the angular momentum build-up is
achieved by an angular momentum transfer from the electron bath (supplier) to
the magnon bath (receiver) and followed by the spatial transport of angular
momentum (spin current) and dissipation of angular momentum to the phonon bath
(spin relaxation).

<h3>Microscopic origin of the valence transition in tetragonal  EuPd$_2$Si$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10354" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10354</a>
<br>
<i>Young-Joon Song, Susanne Schulz, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Roser Valentí</i>
<br>
Under temperature or pressure tuning, tetragonal EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ is known to
undergo a valence transition from nearly divalent to nearly trivalent Eu
accompanied by a volume reduction. Albeit intensive work, its origin is not yet
completely understood. Here, we investigate the mechanism of the valence
transition under volume compression by density functional theory calculations
(DFT). Our analysis suggests that the transition is a consequence of an
enhanced $c$$-$$f$ hybridization between localized Eu 4$f$ states and itinerant
conduction states (Eu 5$d$, Pd 4$d$, and Si 3$p$) where the interplay of the
electronic bandwidth, crystal field environment, Coulomb repulsion, Hund's
coupling and spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role for the transition to
happen. The change in the electronic structure is intimately related to the
volume reduction where Eu-Pd(Si) bond lengths shorten. In a next step we
compare our DFT results to surface-sensitive photoemission data in which the
mixed-valent properties of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ are reflected in a simultaneous
observation of divalent and trivalent signals from the Eu $4f$ shell.

<h3>Tailoring spin waves in 2D transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides  via atomic-layer substitution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10356" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10356</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto M. Ruiz, Dorye L. Esteras, Andrey Rybakov, José J. Baldoví</i>
<br>
The family of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals transition metal phosphorus
trichalcogenides has received a renewed interest due to their intrinsic 2D
antiferromagnetism, which proves them as unprecedented and highly tunable
building blocks for spintronics and magnonics at the single-layer limit.
Herein, motivated by the exciting potential of atomic-substitution demonstrated
in Janus transition metal dichalcogenides, we investigate the crystal,
electronic and magnetic structure of selenized Janus monolayers based on
MnPS$_3$ and NiPS$_3$ from first-principles. In addition, we calculate the
magnon dispersion and perform real-time real-space atomistic dynamic
simulations to explore the propagation of spin waves in MnPS$_3$, NiPS$_3$,
MnPS$_{1.5}$Se$_{1.5}$ and NiPS$_{1.5}$Se$_{1.5}$. Our calculations predict a
drastic enhancement of magnetic anisotropy and the emergence of large
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, which arises from the induced broken
inversion symmetry in the 2D Janus layers. These results pave the way to the
development of Janus 2D transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides and
highlight their potential for magnonic applications.

<br>
Hexagonal YMnO$_{3}$ is a prototype antiferromagnet which exhibits
multiferroic behavior with the ferroelectric and magnetic transitions occurring
at different temperatures. We observe an out-of-plane canting of the Mn$^{3+}$
magnetic moments using resonant X-ray diffraction (RXD) in a single crystal of
this material. These canted moments result in the symmetry-forbidden (0,0,1)
magnetic Bragg reflection, which is observed at the Mn $L_{2,3}$ absorption
edges. We also observe an unexpected difference in the RXD spectral shapes at
different temperatures. Using ab initio calculations, we explore the
possibility that this behavior arises due to the interference between
scattering from the canted magnetic moments and parity-odd atomic multipoles on
the Mn$^{3+}$ ions.

<h3>A systematic DFT+U and Quantum Monte Carlo benchmark of magnetic  two-dimensional (2D) CrX$_3$ (X = I, Br, Cl, F)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10379</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Wines, Kamal Choudhary, Francesca Tavazza</i>
<br>
The search for two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials has attracted a great
deal of attention because of the experimental synthesis of 2D CrI$_3$, which
has a measured Curie temperature of 45 K. Often times, these monolayers have a
higher degree of electron correlation and require more sophisticated methods
beyond density functional theory (DFT). Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a
correlated electronic structure method that has been demonstrated successful
for calculating the electronic and magnetic properties of a wide variety of 2D
and bulk systems, since it has a weaker dependence on the Hubbard parameter (U)
and density functional. In this study we designed a workflow that combines
DFT+U and DMC in order to treat 2D correlated magnetic systems. We chose
monolayer CrX$_3$ (X = I, Br, Cl, F), with a stronger focus on CrI$_3$ and
CrBr$_3$, as a case study due to the fact that they have been experimentally
realized and have a finite critical temperature. With this DFT+U and DMC
workflow and the analytical method of Torelli and Olsen, we estimated an upper
bound of 43.56 K for the T$_c$ of CrI$_3$ and 20.78 K for the T$_c$ of
CrBr$_3$, in addition to analyzing the spin densities and magnetic properties
with DMC and DFT+U. We expect that running this workflow for a well-known
material class will aid in the future discovery and characterization of lesser
known and more complex correlated 2D magnetic materials.

<h3>From Kosterlitz-Thouless to Pokrovsky-Talapov transitions in spinless  fermions and spin chains with next-nearest neighbour interactions</h3>

<br>
<i>Natalia Chepiga</i>
<br>
We investigate the nature of the quantum phase transition out of
charge-density-wave phase in the spinless fermion model with nearest- and
next-nearest-neighbor interaction at one-third filling. Using an extensive
Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations we show that the
transition changes it nature. We show that for weak next-nearest-neighbor
coupling the transition is of Kosterlitz-Thouless type in agreement with
bosonisation predictions. We also provide strong numerical evidences that for
large next-nearest-neighbor repulsion the transition belongs to the
Pokrovsky-Talapov univerality class describing a non-conformal
commensurate-incommensurate transition. Finally, we argue that the change of
the nature of the transition is a result of incommensurability induced by
frustration and realized even at zero doping. The implications in the context
of XXZ chain with next-nearest-neighbor Ising interaction is briefly discussed.

<h3>Unified characterization for higher-order topological phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10394" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10394</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Jia, Xin-Chi Zhou, Lin Zhang, Long Zhang, Xiong-Jun Liu</i>
<br>
Higher-order topological phase transitions (HOTPTs) are associated with
closing either the bulk energy gap (type-I) or boundary energy gap (type-II)
without changing symmetry. The type-I and type-II transitions are usually
characterized separately and are hard to distinguish in experiments. Here we
propose a unified topological characterization of the HOTPTs, which further
enables a precise detection of the both types of topological transitions by
quench dynamics. For a higher-order topological phase a correspondence is shown
between the mass domain walls on real-space boundaries and the higher-order
band-inversion surfaces (BISs) which are certain interfaces in the momentum
subspace. The topological phase transitions occur when momentum-space
topological nodes, dubbed higher-order topological charges, cross the
higher-order BISs after proper projection. Particularly, the bulk (or boundary)
gap closes when all (or part of) topological charges cross the BISs,
characterizing the type-I (or type-II) HOTPTs. We finally show that our unified
characterization can be easily measured from quench dynamics, which is driven
with control in experiments.

<h3>Coupled topological flat and wide bands: Quasiparticle formation and  destruction</h3>

<br>
<i>Haoyu Hu, Qimiao Si</i>
<br>
Flat bands amplify correlation effects and are of extensive current interest.
When induced by destructive interference such as on kagome lattices, they
provide a platform to explore both topology in correlated settings and
correlation physics enriched by topology. Recent experiments in correlated
kagome metals have found evidence for strange-metal behavior. A major
theoretical challenge is to study the effect of local Coulomb repulsion when
the band topology obstructs a real-space description. We study coupled
topological flat and wide bands in a variant to the kagome lattice.
Exponentially localized and Kramers-doublet Wannier functions are constructed,
which lead to a Kondo lattice description. We identify an orbital-selective
Mott transition from the effective model, and characterize the Kondo-driven
quasiparticles and their destruction. Our work provides a conceptual framework
to address the strange-metal behavior in kagome metals and beyond.

<h3>Tuning the Many-body Interactions in a Helical Luttinger Liquid</h3>

<br>
In one-dimensional (1D) systems, electronic interactions lead to a breakdown
of Fermi liquid theory and the formation of a Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid (TLL).
The strength of its many-body correlations can be quantified by a single
dimensionless parameter, the Luttinger parameter $K$, characterising the
competition between the electrons' kinetic and electrostatic energies.
Recently, signatures of a TLL have been reported for the topological edge
states of quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators, strictly 1D electronic structures
with linear (Dirac) dispersion and spin-momentum locking. Here we show that the
many-body interactions in such helical Luttinger Liquid can be effectively
controlled by the edge state's dielectric environment. This is reflected in a
tunability of the Luttinger parameter $K$, distinct on different edges of the
crystal, and extracted to high accuracy from the statistics of tunnelling
spectra at tens of tunneling points. The interplay of topology and many-body
correlations in 1D helical systems has been suggested as a potential avenue
towards realising non-Abelian parafermions.

<h3>Multipolar ordering from dynamical mean field theory with application to  CeB6</h3>

<br>
Magnetic and multipolar ordering in f electron systems takes place at low
temperatures of order 1-10 Kelvin. Combinations of first-principles with
many-body calculations for such low-energy properties of correlated materials
are challenging problems. We address multipolar ordering in f electron systems
based on the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density
functional theory. We derive the momentum-dependent multipolar susceptibilities
and interactions by solving the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation of the
two-particle Green's function. We apply the formalism to the prototypical
example of multipolar ordering CeB6, and demonstrate that the experimental
quadrupole transition is correctly reproduced. This first-principles formalism
based on DMFT and BS equation has applications which are beyond the reach of
the traditional RKKY formula. In particular, more itinerant electron systems
including 5f, 4d and 5d electrons can be addressed.

<h3>Superfluid properties of a honeycomb dipolar supersolid</h3>

<br>
<i>Albert Gallemí, Luis Santos</i>
<br>
Recent breakthrough experiments on dipolar condensates have reported the
creation of supersolids, including two-dimensional arrays of quantum droplets.
Droplet arrays are, however, not the only possible non-trivial density
arrangement resulting from the interplay of mean-field instability and quantum
stabilization. Several other possible density patterns may occur in trapped
condensates at higher densities, including the so-called honeycomb supersolid,
a phase that exists, as it is also the case of a triangular droplet supersolid,
in the thermodynamic limit. We show that compared to droplet supersolids,
honeycomb supersolids have a much-enhanced superfluid fraction while keeping a
large density contrast, and constitute in this sense a much better dipolar
supersolid. However, in contrast to droplet supersolids, quantized vortices
cannot be created in a honeycomb supersolid without driving a transition into a
so-called labyrinthic phase. We show that the reduced moment of inertia, and
with it the superfluid fraction, can be however reliably probed by studying the
dynamics following a scissors-like perturbation.

<h3>An ab initio approach to anisotropic alloying into the Si(001) surface</h3>

<br>
<i>D. V. Prodan, G. V. Paradezhenko, D. Yudin, A. A. Pervishko</i>
<br>
Employing density functional theory calculations we explore initial stage of
competitive alloying of co-deposited silver and indium atoms into a silicon
surface. Particularly, we identify respective adsorption positions and
activation barriers governing their diffusion on the dimer-reconstructed
silicon surface. Further, we develop a growth model that properly describes
diffusion mechanisms and silicon morphology with the account of silicon
dimerization and the presence of C-type defects. Based on the surface kinetic
Monte Carlo simulations we examine dynamics of bimetallic adsorption and
elaborate on the temperature effects on the submonolayer growth of Ag-In alloy.
A close inspection of adatom migration clearly indicates effective nucleation
of Ag and In atoms, followed by the formation of orthogonal one-dimensional
atomic chains. We show that the epitaxial bimetal growth might potentially lead
to exotic ordering of adatoms in the form of anisotropic two-dimensional
lattices via orthogonal oriented single-atom wide metal rows. We argue that
this scenario becomes favorable provided above room temperature, while our
numerical results are shown to be in agreement with experimental findings.

<h3>Equivalence of fluctuation-dissipation and Edwards' temperature in  cyclically sheared granular systems</h3>

<i>Zhikun Zeng, Shuyang Zhang, Xu Zheng, Chengjie Xia, Walter Kob, Ye Yuan, Yujie Wang</i>
<br>
Using particle trajectory data obtained from x-ray tomography, we determine
two kinds of effective temperatures in a cyclically sheared granular system.
The first one is obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which
relates the diffusion and mobility of lighter tracer particles immersed in the
system. The second is the Edwards compactivity defined via the packing volume
fluctuations. We find robust excellent agreement between these two
temperatures, independent of the type of the tracers, cyclic shear amplitudes,
and particle surface roughness. We further elucidate that in granular systems
the viscous-like drag force is due to the broken symmetry of the local contact
geometry.

We show how the replica method can be used to compute the asymptotic
eigenvalue spectrum of a real Wishart product matrix. This provides a compact,
elementary derivation of a polynomial condition on the Stieltjes transform
first proved by M\"uller [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory. 48, 2086-2091 (2002)]. We
additionally derive polynomial conditions on the minimum and maximum
eigenvalues, which match the results obtained by Akemann, Ipsen, and Kieburg
[Phys. Rev. E 88, 052118 (2013)] for the complex Wishart product ensemble.

<br>
The possibility of almost linear tuning of the band gap and of the electrical
and optical properties in monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenide (S-TMD) alloys opens up the way to fabricate materials with
on-demand characteristics. By making use of photoluminescence spectroscopy, we
investigate optical properties of WSSe MLs with a S/Se ratio of 57/43 deposited
on SiO$_2$/Si substrate and encapsulated in hexagonal BN flakes. Similarly to
the $"parent"$ WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ MLs, we assign the WSSe MLs to the ML family
with the dark ground exciton state. We find that, in addition to the neutral
bright A exciton line, three observed emission lines are associated with
negatively charged excitons. The application of in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetic fields allows us to assign undeniably the bright and dark (spin- and
momentum-forbidden) negative trions as well as the phonon replica of the dark
spin-forbidden complex. Furthermore, the existence of the single photon
emitters in the WSSe ML is also demonstrated, thus prompting the opportunity to
enlarge the wavelength range for potential future quantum applications of
S-TMDs.

<h3>Terrace effects in grazing-incidence fast atom diffraction from a  LiF(001) surface</h3>

<br>
<i>L. Frisco, M. S. Gravielle</i>
<br>
The effect produced by surface defects on grazing-incidence fast atom
diffraction (GIFAD) patterns is studied by considering the presence of terraces
in a LiF(001) sample. For helium atoms impinging along the <110> direction of
the LiF surface, we analyze the influence of a monolayer terrace with its edge
oriented parallel or perpendicular to the axial channel. We found that the
presence of an outward transverse step introduces a diffuse background above
the Laue circle, which displays additional peaked structures. For inward
transverse steps, instead, such a background is placed below the Laue circle,
showing a much weaker intensity. On the other hand, parallel steps give rise to
asymmetric angular distributions, which are completely confined to the Laue
circle. Therefore, these theoretical results suggest that GIFAD might be used
to characterize terrace defects.

<h3>Emergent Magnetism and Intrinsic Anomalous Hall Effect in KTaO$_3$  Two-Dimensional Electron Gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10534</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick Krantz, Alex Tyner, Pallab Goswami, Venkat Chandrasekhar</i>
<br>
There has been intense recent interest in the two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs) that form at the surfaces and interfaces of KTaO$_3$ (KTO), with the
discovery of superconductivity at temperatures significantly higher than those
of similar 2DEGs based on SrTiO$_3$ (STO). Here we demonstrate that KTO 2DEGs
fabricated under conditions that suppress the superconductivity show emergent
magnetism at low temperatures that can be tuned by a gate voltage, V$_g$. The
signature of this magnetism is a zero-field transverse voltage that increases
in magnitude with decreasing V$_g$, that is strongly asymmetric with respect to
an applied perpendicular magnetic field, and that becomes hysteretic in field
as the temperature is lowered. We argue that it is due to a finite Berry
curvature of the KTO Ta bands in the presence of time-reversal symmetry
breaking associated with ordered local moments, with unique features associated
with the complex spin texture introduced by spin-orbit interactions in KTO.
