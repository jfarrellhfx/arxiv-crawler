<h3>How heat propagates in `non-Fermi liquid' $^3$He</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00502" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00502</a>

In Landau's Fermi liquid, transport is governed by scattering between
quasi-particles. The normal liquid $^3$He conforms to this picture, but only
when T$< 0.02$ T$_F$. Here, we observe that the deviation from the standard
behavior is concomitant with the fermion-fermion scattering time falling below
the Planckian time, $\frac{\hbar}{k_BT}$. The thermal diffusivity of this
quantum liquid is bounded by a minimum set by fundamental physical constants
and earlier observed in classical liquids. This implies that collective
excitations of the liquid (a sound mode) are carrying heat. We argue that if
heat is carried by 2k$_F$ hydrodynamic sound mode, both the amplitude and the
hitherto unexplained $T^{1/2}$ temperature dependence of thermal conductivity
find an explanation with no other adjustable parameter.

<h3>Continuity Equation for the Flow of Fisher Information in Wave  Scattering</h3>

Using waves to explore our environment is a widely used paradigm, ranging
from seismology to radar technology, and from bio-medical imaging to precision
measurements. In all of these fields, the central aim is to gather as much
information as possible about an object of interest by sending a probing wave
at it and processing the information delivered back to the detector. Here, we
demonstrate that an electromagnetic wave scattered at an object carries locally
defined and conserved information about all of the object's constitutive
parameters. Specifically, we introduce here the density and flux of Fisher
information for very general types of wave fields and identify corresponding
sources and sinks of information through which all these new quantities satisfy
a fundamental continuity equation. We experimentally verify our theoretical
predictions by studying a movable object embedded inside a disordered
environment and by measuring the corresponding Fisher information flux at
microwave frequencies. Our results provide a new understanding of the
generation and propagation of information and open up new possibilities for
tracking and designing the flow of information even in complex environments.

<h3>The pypadf package: computing the pair-angle distribution function from  fluctuation scattering data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00012</a>

<br>

The pair-angle distribution function (PADF) is a three- and four-atom
correlation function that can characterise the local angular structure of
disordered materials, particles or nanocrystalline materials. The PADF can be
measured by x-ray or electron fluctuation diffraction experiments, which can be
collected by scanning a small beam across a structurally disordered sample or
flowing a sample across the beam path. It is a natural generalisation of the
established pair-distribution methods, which do not provide angular
information. This software package provides tools to calculate the PADF from
from fluctuation diffraction data. The package includes tools for calculating
the intensity correlation function, which is a necessary step in the PADF
calculation and also the basis for other fluctuation scattering techniques.

<h3>Comment on "Flocking without Alignment Interactions in Attractive Active  Brownian Particles [arXiv:2303.07746]"</h3>

<i>Benoît Mahault</i>
<br>
<br>
In a recent Letter, Caprini and L\"owen argue that attractive active Brownian
particles can flock even in the absence of explicit aligning interactions of
their velocities. In this comment, I show that the phenomenology described in
[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 148202 (2023)] in fact lacks several defining
features of flocking, such as long-range correlations and large-scale directed
motion.

<h3>Electric field control of a quantum spin liquid in weak Mott insulators</h3>

The triangular lattice Hubbard model at strong coupling, whose effective spin
model contains both Heisenberg and ring exchange interactions, exhibits a rich
phase diagram as the ratio of the hopping $t$ to onsite Coulomb repulsion $U$
is tuned. This includes a chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase. Nevertheless, this
exotic phase remains challenging to realize experimentally because a given
material has a fixed value of $t/U$ that can difficultly be tuned with external
stimuli. One approach to address this problem is applying a DC electric field,
which renormalizes the exchange interactions as electrons undergo virtual
hopping processes; in addition to creating virtual doubly occupied sites,
electrons must overcome electric potential energy differences. Performing a
small $t/U$ expansion to fourth order, we derive the ring exchange model in the
presence of an electric field and find that it not only introduces spatial
anisotropy but also tends to enhance the ring exchange term compared to the
dominant nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction. Thus, increasing the electric
field serves as a way to increase the importance of the ring exchange at
constant $t/U$. Through density matrix renormalization group calculations, we
compute the ground state phase diagram of the ring exchange model for two
different electric field directions. In both cases, we find that the electric
field shifts the phase boundary of the CSL towards a smaller ratio of $t/U$.
Therefore, the electric field can drive a magnetically ordered state into the
CSL. This explicit demonstration opens the door to tuning other quantum spin
systems into spin liquid phases via the application of an electric field.

<h3>Noise probing of topological band gaps in dispersionless quantum states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00042</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Kruchkov, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<br>
<br>
We uncover a useful connection between the integrated current noise
$S(\omega)$ and the topological band gap in dispersionless quantum states,
$\int d \omega [ \mathcal S^{\text{flat}}_{xx} + \mathcal S^{\text{flat}}_{yy}
] = C e^2 \Delta^2$ (in units $\hbar$$=$$1$), where $C$ is the Chern number,
$e$ is electric charge, and $\Delta$ is the topological band gap. This
relationship may serve as a working principle for a new experimental probe of
topological band gaps in flat band materials. Possible applications include
moir\'e systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene and twisted transition metal
dichalcogenides, where a band gap measurement in meV regime presents an
experimental challenge.

<br>
<br>
Equalities are always a better option to be verified in an experiment than
inequalities. In this work, for classical and isothermal processes, I provide
thermodynamic equalities valid when the optimizations of macroscopic
thermodynamic quantities are achieved in weak drivings. I illustrate their
applicability by using them as a convergence criterion in the global
optimization technique of genetic programming.

<h3>On the local aspect of valleytronics</h3>

Valley magnetic moments play a crucial role in valleytronics in 2D hexagonal
materials. Traditionally, based on studies of quantum states in homogeneous
bulks, it is widely believed that only materials with broken structural
inversion symmetry can exhibit nonvanishing valley magnetic moments. Such
constraint excludes from relevant applications those with inversion symmetry,
as specifically exemplified by gapless monolayer graphene despite its
technological advantage in routine growth and production. This work revisits
valley-derived magnetic moments in a broad context covering inhomogeneous
structures as well. It generalizes the notion of valley magnetic moment for a
state from an integrated total quantity to the local field called "local valley
magnetic moment" with space-varying distribution. In suitable
inversion-symmetric structures with inhomogeneity, e.g., zigzag nanoribbons of
gapless monolayer graphene, it is shown that the local moment of a state can be
nonvanishing with sizable magnitude, while the corresponding total moment is
subject to the broken symmetry constraint. Moreover, it is demonstrated that
such local moment can interact with space-dependent electric and magnetic
fields manifesting pronounced field effects and making possible a local valley
control with external fields. Overall, a path to "local valleytronics" is
illustrated which exploits local valley magnetic moments for device
applications, relaxes the broken symmetry constraint on materials, and expands
flexibility in the implementation of valleytronics.

<h3>New insights into the laser-assisted photoelectric effect from  solid-state surfaces</h3>

Photoemission from a solid surface provides a wealth of information about the
electronic structure of the surface and its dynamic evolution. Ultrafast
pump-probe experiments are particularly useful to study the dynamic
interactions of photons with surfaces as well as the ensuing electron dynamics
induced by these interactions. Time-resolved laser-assisted photoemission
(tr-LAPE) from surfaces is a novel technique to gain deeper understanding of
the fundamentals underlying the photoemission process. Here, we present the
results of a femtosecond time-resolved soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
experiment on two different metal surfaces conducted at the X-ray Free-Electron
Laser FLASH in Hamburg. We study photoemission from the W 4f and Pt 4f core
levels using ultrashort soft X-ray pulses in combination with synchronized
infrared (IR) laser pulses. When both pulses overlap in time and space,
laser-assisted photoemission results in the formation of a series of sidebands
that reflect the dynamics of the laser-surface interaction. We demonstrate a
qualitatively new level of sideband generation up to the sixth order and a
surprising material dependence of the number of sidebands that has so far not
been predicted by theory. We provide a semi-quantitative explanation of this
phenomenon based on the different dynamic dielectric responses of the two
materials. Our results advance the understanding of the LAPE process and reveal
new details of the IR field present in the surface region, which is determined
by the dynamic interplay between the IR laser field and the dielectric response
of the metal surfaces.

<h3>Manganese Dissolution in alkaline medium with and without concurrent  oxygen evolution in LiMn$_2$O$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00101" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00101</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Manganese dissolution during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been a
persistent challenge that impedes the practical implementation of Mn-based
electrocatalysts including the LiMn$_x$O$_4$ system in aqueous alkaline
electrolyte. The investigated LiMn$_2$O$_4$ particles exhibit two distinct Mn
dissolution processes; one independent of OER and the other associated to OER.
Combining the bulk sensitive X-ray absorption spectroscopy, surface sensitive
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical detection of Mn
dissolution using rotating ring-disk electrode, we explore the less understood
Mn dissolution mechanism during OER. We correlate near-surface oxidation with
the charge attributed to dissolved Mn, which demonstrates increasing Mn
dissolution with the formation of surface Mn4+ species under anodic potential.
The observed stronger dissolution during the OER is attributed to the formation
of additional Mn$^{4+}$ from Mn$^{3+}$ during OER. We show that control over
the amount of Mn4+ in Li$_x$Mn2O$_4$ before the onset of the OER can partially
mitigate the OER-triggered dissolution. Overall, our atomistic insights into
the Mn dissolution processes are crucial for knowledge-guided mitigation of
electrocatalyst degradation, which can be broadly extended to manganese-based
oxide systems.

<h3>Enhanced weak superconductivity in trigonal $γ$-PtBi$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00105" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00105</a>
<br>
<i>J. Zabala, P. Pedrazzini, F. J. Castro, V. F. Correa</i>
<br>
<br>
Electrical transport experiments show superconductivity in a high-quality
single crystal of trigonal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$. The critical temperature shows a
large dependence on the electrical current and in the limit of very low
currents, a $T_c$ = 1.1 K is observed, while a zero temperature critical field
$B_c $(0) $\approx$ 1.5 Tesla is estimated. These are the highest
superconducting parameters reported (at ambient pressure) in a stoichiometric
$\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ bulk sample so far. Under a magnetic field a strict zero
resistance state is no longer observed even though an incipient superconducting
transition is seen. Such a behavior is most probably associated with very low
critical currents and is reminiscent of filamentary superconductivity. The
superconducting state is elusive to magnetization measurements discarding a
bulk phase down to $T =$ 0.3 K.

<h3>In-situ Thermophysical Measurement of Flowing Molten Chloride Salt Using  Modulated Photothermal Radiometry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00106</a>

Molten salts are a leading candidate for high-temperature heat transfer
fluids (HTFs) for thermal energy storage and conversion systems in concentrated
solar power (CSP) and nuclear energy power plants. The ability to probe molten
salt thermal transport properties in both stationary and flowing status is
important for the evaluation of their heat transfer performance under realistic
operational conditions, including the temperature range and potential
degradation due to corrosion and contamination. However, accurate thermal
transport properties are usually challenging to obtain even for stagnant molten
salts due to different sources of errors from convection, radiation, and
corrosion, let alone flowing ones. To the best of authors' knowledge, there is
no available in-situ technique for measuring flowing molten salt thermal
conductivity. Here, we report the first in-situ flowing molten salt thermal
conductivity measurement using modulated photothermal radiometry (MPR). We
could successfully perform the first in-situ thermal conductivity measurement
of flowing molten $NaCl-KCl-MgCl_2$ in the typical operating temperature (520
and 580 $^oC$) with flow velocities ranging from around 0.3 to 1.0 $m$$s^-1$.
The relative change of the molten salt thermal conductivity was measured.
Gnielinski's correlation was also used to estimate the heat transfer
coefficient h of the flowing $NaCl-KCl-MgCl_2$ in the given experimental
condition. The work showed the potential of the MPR technique serving as an
in-situ diagnostics tool to evaluate the heat transfer performance of flowing
molten salts and other high-temperature HTFs.

<h3>Topological phase transition between composite-fermion and Pfaffian  daughter states near ν = 1/2 FQHS</h3>

<br>
$\nu$=1/2 is among the most enigmatic many-body phases in two-dimensional
electron systems as it appears in the ground-state rather than an excited
Landau level. It is observed in wide quantum wells where the electrons have a
bilayer charge distribution with finite tunneling. Whether this 1/2 FQHS is
two-component (Abelian) or one-component (non-Abelian) has been debated since
its experimental discovery over 30 years ago. Here, we report strong 1/2 FQHSs
in ultrahigh-quality, wide, GaAs quantum wells, with transport energy gaps up
to $\simeq$4K, among the largest gaps reported for any even-denominator FQHS.
The 1/2 FQHS is flanked by numerous, Jain-sequence FQHSs at
$\nu$=$p$/(2$p$$\pm$1) up to $\nu$=8/17 and 9/17. Remarkably, as we raise the
density and strengthen the 1/2 FQHS, the 8/17 and 7/13 FQHSs suddenly become
strong, much stronger than their neighboring high-order FQHSs. Insofar as FQHSs
at $\nu$=8/17 and 7/13 are precisely the theoretically-predicted, simplest,
daughter states of the one-component Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS, our data suggest a
topological phase-transition of 8/17 and 7/13 FQHSs from the Jain-states to the
daughter states of the Pfaffian, and that the parent 1/2 FQHS we observe is the
Pfaffian state.

<h3>DFT+DMFT study of the magnetic susceptibility and the correlated  electronic structure in transition-metal intercalated NbS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00112</a>
<br>
<i>Hyowon Park, Ivar Martin</i>
<br>
<br>
The Co-intercalated NbS$_2$ (Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$) compound exhibits large
anomalous Hall conductance, likely due to the non-coplanar magnetic ordering of
Co spins. In this work, we study the relation between this novel magnetism and
the correlated electronic structure of Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ by adopting dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT) to treat the correlation effect of Co $d$ orbitals. We
find that the hole doping of Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ can tune the size of the Nb hole
pocket at the DMFT Fermi surface, producing features consistent with those
observed in angle resolved photoemission spectra [Phys. Rev. B 105, L121102
(2022)]. We also compute the momentum-resolved spin susceptibility, and
correlate it with the Fermi surface shape. We find that the magnetic ordering
wavevector of Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ obtained from the peak in spin susceptibility
agrees with the one observed experimentally by neutron scattering; it is
compatible with commensurate non-coplanar $3q$ spin structure. We also discuss
how results change if some other than Co transition metal intercalations are
used.

<h3>Signatures of Majorana Zero-Modes in an isolated one-dimensional  superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00118</a>
<br>
<i>Rohith Sajith, Kartiek Agarwal, Ivar Martin</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine properties of the mean-field wave function of the one-dimensional
Kitaev model supporting Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) \emph{when restricted} to a
fixed number of particles. Such wave functions can in fact be realized as exact
ground states of interacting number-conserving Hamiltonians and amount to a
more realistic description of the finite isolated superconductors. Akin to
their mean-field parent, the fixed-number wave functions encode a single
electron spectral function at zero energy that decays exponentially away from
the edges, with a localization length that agrees with the mean-field value.
Based purely on the structure of the number-projected ground states, we
construct the fixed particle number generalization of the MZM operators. They
can be used to compute the edge tunneling conductance; however, notably the
value of the zero-bias conductance remains the same as in the mean-field case,
quantized to $2e^2/h$. We also compute the topological entanglement entropy for
the number-projected wave functions and find that it contains a `robust'
$\log(2)$ component as well as a logarithmic correction to the mean field
result, which depends on the precise partitioning used to compute it. The
presence of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy indicates the
absence of a spectral gap above the ground state; as one introduces
fluctuations in the number of particles, the correction vanishes smoothly.

<h3>Conformation and dynamics of partially active linear polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00122" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00122</a>
<br>
<i>Marin Vatin, Sumanta Kundu, Emanuele Locatelli</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform numerical simulations of isolated, partially active polymers,
driven out-of-equilibrium by a fraction of their monomers. We show that, if the
active beads are all gathered in a contiguous block, the position of the
section along the chain determines the conformational and dynamical properties
of the system. Notably, one can modulate the diffusion coefficient of the
polymer from {active-like to passive-like} just by changing the position of the
active block. Further, in special cases, enhancement of diffusion can be
achieved by decreasing the overall polymer activity. Our findings may help in
the modelization of active biophysical systems, such as filamentous bacteria or
worms.

We review how unitarity and stationarity in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism
naturally lead to a (quantum) generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation

also presented. Additionally, we illustrate the application of this gFDR in
various scenarios related to quantum Brownian motion and the generalized
Langevin equation.

We introduce the first extension of a Lattice Gas Automaton (LGA) model to
accurately replicate observed emergent phenomena in granular materials with a
special focus on previously unexplored jamming transitions by incorporating
gravitational effects, energy dissipation in particle collisions, and wall
friction. We successfully reproduce flow rate evolution, density wave
formation, and jamming transition observed in experiments. We also explore the
critical density at which jamming becomes probable. This research advances our
understanding of granular dynamics and offers insights into the jamming
behavior of granular materials.

<h3>Breakdown of the drift-diffusion model for transverse spin transport in  a disordered Pt film</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin accumulation and spin current profiles are calculated for a disordered
Pt film subjected to an in-plane electric current within the nonequilibrium
Green function approach. In the bulklike region of the sample, this approach
captures the intrinsic spin Hall effect found in other calculations. Near the
surfaces, the results reveal qualitative differences with the results of the
widely used spin-diffusion model, even when the boundary conditions are
modified to try to account for them. One difference is that the effective
spin-diffusion length for transverse spin transport is significantly different
from its longitudinal counterpart and is instead similar to the mean-free path.
This feature may be generic for spin currents generated via the intrinsic
spin-Hall mechanism because of the differences in transport mechanisms compared
to longitudinal spin transport. Orbital accumulation in the Pt film is only
significant in the immediate vicinity of the surfaces and has a small component
penetrating into the bulk only in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, as a
secondary effect induced by the spin accumulation.

<h3>On the Uncertainty Estimates of Equivariant-Neural-Network-Ensembles  Interatomic Potentials</h3>

<br>
Machine-learning (ML) interatomic potentials (IPs) trained on
first-principles datasets are becoming increasingly popular since they promise
to treat larger system sizes and longer time scales, compared to the {\em ab
initio} techniques producing the training data. Estimating the accuracy of
MLIPs and reliably detecting when predictions become inaccurate is key for
enabling their unfailing usage. In this paper, we explore this aspect for a
specific class of MLIPs, the equivariant-neural-network (ENN) IPs using the
ensemble technique for quantifying their prediction uncertainties. We
critically examine the robustness of uncertainties when the ENN ensemble IP
(ENNE-IP) is applied to the realistic and physically relevant scenario of
predicting local-minima structures in the configurational space. The ENNE-IP is
trained on data for liquid silicon, created by density-functional theory (DFT)
with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation
functional. Then, the ensemble-derived uncertainties are compared with the
actual errors (comparing the results of the ENNE-IP with those of the
underlying DFT-GGA theory) for various test sets, including liquid silicon at
different temperatures and out-of-training-domain data such as solid phases
with and without point defects as well as surfaces. Our study reveals that the
predicted uncertainties are generally overconfident and hold little
quantitative predictive power for the actual errors.

<h3>Pseudo-magnetic fields in square lattices</h3>

We have investigated the effects of strain on two-dimensional square lattices
and examined the methods for inducing pseudo-magnetic fields. In both the
columnar and staggered $\pi$-flux square lattices, we have found that strain
only modulates Fermi velocities rather than inducing pseudo-magnetic fields.
However, spatially non-uniform on-site potentials (anisotropic hoppings) can
create pseudo-magnetic fields in columnar (staggered) $\pi$-flux square
lattices. On the other hand, we demonstrate that strain does induce
pseudo-magnetic fields in staggered zero-flux square lattices. By breaking a
quarter of the bonds, we clarify that a staggered zero-flux square lattice is
topologically equivalent to a honeycomb lattice and displays pseudo-vector
potentials and pseudo-Landau levels at the Dirac points.

<h3>Topological chiral kagome lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chirality, a fundamental structural property of crystals, can induce many
unique topological quantum phenomena. In kagome lattice, unconventional
transports have been reported under tantalizing chiral charge order. Here, we
show how by deforming the kagome lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D)
chiral kagome lattice in which the key band features of the non-chiral 2D
kagome lattice - flat energy bands, van Hove singularities (VHSs), and
degeneracies - remain robust in both the $k_z$ = 0 and $\pi$ planes in momentum
space. Given the handedness of our kagome lattice, degenerate momentum points
possess quantized Chern numbers, ushering in the realization of Weyl fermions.
Our 3D chiral kagome lattice surprisingly exhibits 1D behavior on its surface,
where topological surface Fermi arc states connecting Weyl fermions are
dispersive in one momentum direction and flat in the other direction. These 1D
Fermi arcs open up unique possibilities for generating unconventional non-local
transport phenomena at the interfaces of domains with different handedness, and
the associated enhanced conductance as the separation of the leads on the
surface is increased. Employing first-principles calculations, we investigate
in-depth the electronic and phononic structures of representative materials
within the ten space groups that can support topological chiral kagome
lattices. Our study opens a new research direction that integrates the
advantages of structural chirality with those of a kagome lattice and thus
provides a new materials platform for exploring unique aspects of correlated
topological physics in chiral lattices.

Silicon-based spin qubits offer a potential pathway toward realizing a
scalable quantum computer owing to their compatibility with semiconductor
manufacturing technologies. Recent experiments in this system have demonstrated
crucial technologies, including high-fidelity quantum gates and multiqubit
operation. However, the realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer
requires a high-fidelity spin measurement faster than decoherence. To address
this challenge, we characterize and optimize the initialization and measurement
procedures using the parity-mode Pauli spin blockade technique. Here, we
demonstrate a rapid (with a duration of a few us) and accurate (with >99%
fidelity) parity spin measurement in a silicon double quantum dot. These
results represent a significant step forward toward implementing
measurement-based quantum error correction in silicon.

The Doi-Peliti method is effective for investigating classical stochastic
processes, and it has wide applications, including field theoretic approaches.
Furthermore, it is applicable not only to master equations but also to
stochastic differential equations; one can derive a kind of discrete process
from stochastic differential equations. A remarkable fact is that the
Doi-Peliti method is related to a different analytical approach, i.e.,
generating function. The connection with the generating function approach helps
to understand the derivation of discrete processes from stochastic differential
equations. Here, a redundant basis interpretation for the Doi-Peliti method is
proposed, which enables us to derive different types of discrete processes. The
conventional correspondence with the generating function approach is also
extended. The proposed extensions give us a new tool to study stochastic
differential equations. As an application of the proposed interpretation, we
perform numerical experiments for a finite-state approximation of the derived
discrete process from the noisy van der Pol system; the redundant basis yields
reasonable results compared with the conventional discrete process with the
same number of states.

<h3>Suppression of both superconductivity and structural transition in  hole-doped MoTe$_2$ induced by Ta substitution</h3>

<br>

Type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe$_2$ exhibits a first-order structural transition
at $T_s$ $\sim$250~K and superconducts at $T_c$ $\sim$0.1~K at ambient
pressure. Both $T_s$ and $T_c$ can be manipulated by several tuning parameters,
such as hydrostatic pressure and chemical substitution. It is often reported
that suppressing $T_s$ enhances $T_c$, but our study shows a different
behaviour when MoTe$_2$ is hole-doped by Ta. When $T_s$ is suppressed by Ta
doping, $T_c$ is also suppressed. Our findings suggest that the suppression of
$T_s$ does not necessarily enhance superconductivity in MoTe$_2$. By connecting
with the findings of electron-doped MoTe$_2$, we argue that varying electron
carrier concentration can effectively tune $T_c$. In addition, the Hall
coefficient is enhanced around the doping region, where $T_s$ is completely
suppressed, suggesting that the critical scattering around the structural
transition may also play a role in suppressing $T_c$.

<br>
The interplay among frustrated lattice geometry, nontrivial band topology and
correlations yields rich quantum states of matter in Kagome systems. A class of
recent Kagome metals, AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, Cs), exhibit a cascade of
symmetry-breaking transitions, involving 3Q chiral charge ordering, electronic
nematicity, roton pair density wave and superconductivity. The interdependence
among multiple competing orders suggests unconventional superconductivity, the
nature of which is yet to be resolved. Here, we report the electronic evidence
for chiral superconducting domains with boundary supercurrent, a smoking-gun of
chiral superconductivity, in intrinsic CsV3Sb5 akes. Magnetic field-free
superconducting diode effects are observed with its polarity modulated by
thermal histories, unveiling a spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking
within dynamical order parameter domains in the superconducting phase.
Strikingly, the critical current exhibits double-slit superconducting
interference patterns, when subjected to external magnetic field. This is
attributed to the periodic modulation of supercurrent owing along chiral domain
boundaries constrained by fluxoid quantization. Our results provide the direct
demonstration of a time-reversal symmetry breaking superconducting order in
Kagome systems, opening a potential for exploring exotic physics, e.g. Majorana
zero modes, in this intriguing topological Kagome system.

Atomic engineering in a solid-state material has the potential to
functionalize the host with novel phenomena. STM-based lithographic techniques
have enabled the placement of individual phosphorus atoms at selective lattice
sites of silicon with atomic precision. Here, we show that by placing four
phosphorus donors spaced 10-15 nm apart from their neighbours in a linear
chain, it is possible to realize coherent spin coupling between the end dopants
of the chain, analogous to the superexchange interaction in magnetic materials.
Since phosphorus atoms are a promising building block of a silicon quantum
computer, this enables spin coupling between their bound electrons beyond
nearest neighbours, allowing the qubits to be spaced out by 30-45 nm. The added
flexibility in architecture brought about by this long-range coupling not only
reduces gate densities but can also reduce correlated noise between qubits from
local noise sources that are detrimental to error correction codes. We base our
calculations on a full configuration interaction technique in the atomistic
tight-binding basis, solving the 4-electron problem exactly, over a domain of a
million silicon atoms. Our calculations show that superexchange can be tuned
electrically through gate voltages where it is less sensitive to charge noise
and donor placement errors.

<h3>Rethinking Ductility -- A Study Into the Size-Affected Fracture of  Polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00279" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00279</a>

<br>
<br>
Ductility quantifies a material's capacity for plastic deformation, and it is
a key property for preventing fracture driven failure in engineering parts.
While some brittle materials exhibit improved ductility at small scales, the
processes underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. This work
establishes a mechanism for the origin of ductility via an investigation of
size-affected fracture processes and polymer degree of conversion (DC) in
two-photon lithography (TPL) fabricated materials. Microscale single edge notch
bend ($\mu$SENB) specimens were written with widths from 8 to 26 $\mu$m and
with different laser powers and post-write thermal annealing to control the DC
between 17\% and 80\%. We find that shifting from low to high DC predictably
causes a $\sim$3x and $\sim$4x increase in strength and bending stiffness,
respectively, but that there is a corresponding $\sim$6x decrease in fracture
energy from 180 $J/m^2$ to 30 $J/m^2$. Notably, this reduced fracture energy is
accompanied by a ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) in the failure behavior.
Using finite element analysis, we demonstrate that the DBT occurs when the
fracture yielding zone size ($r_p$) approaches the sample width, corresponding
with a known fracture size-affected transition from flaw-based to
strength-based failure. This finding provides a crucial insight that ductility
is a size-induced property that occurs when features are reduced below a
characteristic fracture length scale and that strength, stiffness, and
toughness alone are insufficient predictors of ductility.

We employ a tight-binding model to calculate the optical selection rules of
gold-terminated carbyne chains in the presence of an applied electric field. We
show that both the magnitude of the edge-state gap and the strength of optical
transitions across it can be tuned via the Stark effect. In the case of
sufficiently long carbyne chains, the dipole transitions between edge states
occur within the THz frequency range.

<h3>Quantum mechanics of composite fermions</h3>

<i>Junren Shi</i>

The theory of composite fermions consists of two complementary parts: a
standard ansatz for constructing many-body wave-functions of various fractional
quantum Hall states, and an effective theory (the HLR theory) for predicting
responses of these states to external perturbations. Conventionally, both the
ansatz and the HLR theory are justified by Lopez-Fradkin's theory based on the
singular Chern-Simons transformation. In this work, we aim to provide an
alternative basis and unify the two parts into a coherent theory by developing
quantum mechanics of composite fermions based on the dipole picture. We argue
that states of a composite fermion in the dipole picture are naturally
described by bivariate wave functions which are holomorphic (anti-holomorphic)
in the coordinate of its constituent electron (vortex), defined in a Bergman
space with its weight determined by the spatial profiles of the physical and
the emergent Chern-Simons magnetic fields. Based on a semi-classical
phenomenological model and the quantization rules of the Bergman space, we
establish general wave equations for composite fermions. The wave equations
resemble the ordinary Schr\"odinger equation but have drift velocity
corrections not present in the HLR theory. Using Pasquier-Haldane's
interpretation of the dipole picture, we develop a general wave-function ansatz
for constructing many-body wave functions of electrons by projecting states of
composite fermions solved from the wave equation into a half-filled bosonic
Laughlin state of vortices. It turns out that for ideal fractional quantum Hall
states the general ansatz and the standard ansatz are equivalent, albeit using
different wave-function representations for composite fermions. To justify the
phenomenological model, we derive it from the microscopic Hamiltonian and the
general variational principle of quantum mechanics.

<br>
Tb2Ti2O7, a pyrochlore system, has garnered significant interest due to its
intriguing structural and physical properties and their dependence on external
physical parameters. In this study, utilizing high-brilliance synchrotron X-ray
diffraction, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of structural evolution
of Tb2Ti2O7 under external pressure and temperature. We have conclusively
confirmed the occurrence of an isostructural phase transition beyond the
pressure of 10 GPa. The transition exhibits a distinct signature in the
variation of lattice parameters under pressure and leads to changes in
mechanical properties. The underlying physics driving this transition can be
understood in terms of localized rearrangement of atoms while retaining the
overall cubic symmetry of the crystal. Notably, the observed transition remains
almost independent of temperature. Our findings provide insights into the
distinctive behaviour of the isostructural phase transition in Tb2Ti2O7.

<h3>Topological and nontopological degeneracies in generalized string-net  models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00343</a>
<br>
<i>Anna Ritz-Zwilling, Jean-Noël Fuchs, Steven H. Simon, Julien Vidal</i>
<br>
<br>
Generalized string-net models have been recently proposed in order to enlarge
the set of possible topological quantum phases emerging from the original
string-net construction. In the present work, we do not consider vertex
excitations and restrict to plaquette excitations, or fluxons, that satisfy
important identities. We explain how to compute the energy-level degeneracies
of the generalized string-net Hamiltonian associated to an arbitrary unitary
fusion category. In contrast to the degeneracy of the ground state, which is
purely topological, that of excited energy levels depends not only on the
Drinfeld center of the category, but also on internal multiplicities obtained
from the tube algebra defined from the category. For a noncommutative category,
these internal multiplicities result in extra nontopological degeneracies. Our
results are valid for any trivalent graph and any orientable surface. We
illustrate our findings with nontrivial examples.

<h3>Coexistence of nematic superconductivity and spin density wave in  magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>A.O. Sboychakov, A.V. Rozhkov, A.L. Rakhmanov</i>
<br>
<br>
We argue that doped twisted bilayer graphene with magical twist angle can
become superconducting. In our theoretical scenario the superconductivity
coexists with the spin-density-wave-like ordering. Numerical mean field
analysis demonstrates that the spin-density wave order, which is much stronger
than the superconductivity, leaves parts of the Fermi surface ungapped. This
Fermi surface serves as a host for the superconductivity. Since the magnetic
texture at finite doping breaks the point group of the twisted bilayer
graphene, the stabilized superconducting order parameter is nematic. We also
explore the possibility of purely Coulomb-based mechanism of the
superconductivity in the studied system. The screened Coulomb interaction is
calculated within the random phase approximation. It is shown that near the
half-filling the renormalized Coulomb repulsion indeed induces the
superconducting state, with the order parameter possessing two nodes on the
Fermi surface. We estimate the superconducting transition temperature, which
turns out to be very low. The implications of our proposal are discussed.

<i>Xin Shen, Nir Davidson, Georg M. Bruun, Mingyuan Sun, Zhigang Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent surprising experimental findings, we develop a
strong-coupling theory for Bose-Fermi mixtures capable of treating resonant
inter-species interactions while satisfying the compressibility sum rule. We
show that the mixture can be stable at large interaction strengths close to
resonance, in agreement with the experiment but at odds with the widely used
perturbation theory. We also calculate the sound velocity of the Bose gas in
the $^{133}$Cs-$^6$Li mixture, again finding good agreement with the
experimental observations both at weak and strong interactions. A central
ingredient of our theory is the generalization of a fermion mediated
interaction to strong Bose-Fermi scatterings and to finite frequencies. This
further leads to a predicted hybridization of the sound modes of the Bose and
Fermi gases, which can be directly observed using Bragg spectroscopy.

<h3>The manifold rheology of fluidized granular media</h3>

<br>
<br>
Fluidized granular media have a rich rheology: measuring shear stress
$\sigma$ as a function of shear rate $\dot\gamma$, they exhibit Newtonian
behavior $\sigma\sim\dot\gamma$ for low densities and shear rates, develop a
yield stress for intermediate shear rates and densities approaching the
granular glass transition, and finally, cross over to shear-thickening Bagnold
scaling, $\sigma\sim\dot\gamma^2$. This wealth of flow-behaviors makes
fluidized beds a fascinating material, but also one that is challenging to
encompass into a global theory, despite its relevance for optimizing industrial
processes and predicting natural hazards. We provide careful measurements
spanning eight orders of magnitude in shear rate, and show that all these
rheological regimes can be described qualitatively and quantitatively using the
granular integration through transient formalism, a theory for glassy dynamics
under shear adapted to granular fluids.

We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that

to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev.
Finally, we discuss possible limitations of the device and list necessary

The two-dimensions XY model, undergoes the Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless
(BKT) transition through unbinding of defect pairs of opposite signs. When the
interaction between spins is purely ferromagnetic, these defects have +-1
charge, whereas for pure nematic interaction between spins, they have charge
+-1/2. Two-dimensional XY-model in the presence of both ferromagnetic and
nematic interactions has been studied both theoretically and experimentally. In
this paper, we have studied dynamics of defects in the presence of both
ferromagnetic and nematic interactions on a square lattice. Varying the
strength of ferromagnetic and nematic interactions, we have observed behavior
of both integer and half integer defects and based on that we propose a phase
diagram which exhibit three distinct regions in the phase diagram below the
critical TBKT : polar phase, nematic phase and coexistence phase and a
disordered regions above it. Also, for pure polar and pure nematic case, our
results show that the exponent, for algebraic decay of number of defects with
time, decays linearly with temperature.

A topological transition in high-temperature superconductors FeTe1-xSex,
occurring at a critical range of Se concentration x, underlies their intrinsic
topological superconductivity and emergence of Majorana states within vortices.
Nonetheless, the influence of Se concentration and distribution on the
electronic states in FeTe1-xSex remains unclear, particularly concerning their
relationship with the presence or absence of Majorana states. In this study, we
combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations, pz-dxz/yz-based and
Wannier-based Hamiltonian analysis to systematically explore the electronic
structures of diverse FeTe1-xSex compositions. Our investigation reveals a
nonlinear variation of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) gap between pz and dxz/yz
bands in response to x, with the maximum gap occurring at x = 0.5. The pz-pz
and dx2-y2-pz interactions are found to be critical for pd band inversion.
Furthermore, we ascertain that the distribution of Se significantly modulates
the SOC gap, thereby influencing the presence or absence of Majorana states
within local vortices.

<h3>A Retrofit Sensing Strategy for Soft Fluidic Robots</h3>

<br>
<br>
Soft robots are intrinsically capable of adapting to different environments
by changing their shape in response to interaction forces with the environment.
However, sensing and feedback are still required for higher level decisions and
autonomy. Most sensing technologies developed for soft robots involve the
integration of separate sensing elements in soft actuators, which presents a
considerable challenge for both the fabrication and robustness of soft robots
due to the interface between hard and soft components and the complexity of the
assembly. To circumvent this, here we present a versatile sensing strategy that
can be retrofitted to existing soft fluidic devices without the need for design
changes. We achieve this by measuring the fluidic input that is required to
activate a soft actuator and relating this input to its deformed state during
interaction with the environment. We demonstrate the versatility of our sensing
strategy by tactile sensing of the size, shape, surface roughness and stiffness
of objects. Moreover, we demonstrate our approach by retrofitting it to a range
of existing pneumatic soft actuators and grippers powered by positive and
negative pressure. Finally, we show the robustness of our fluidic sensing
strategy in closed-loop control of a soft gripper for practical applications
such as sorting and fruit picking. Based on these results, we conclude that as
long as the interaction of the actuator with the environment results in a shape
change of the interval volume, soft fluidic actuators require no embedded
sensors and design modifications to implement sensing. We believe that the
relative simplicity, versatility, broad applicability and robustness of our
sensing strategy will catalyze new functionalities in soft interactive devices
and systems, thereby accelerating the use of soft robotics in real world
applications.

<h3>Composition-driven Mott transition within SrTi$_{\rm 1-x}$V$_{\rm  x}$O$_3$</h3>

The last few decades has seen the rapid growth of interest in the bulk
perovskite-type transition metal oxides SrVO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. The electronic
configuration of these perovskites differs by one electron associated to the
transition metal species which gives rise to the drastically different
electronic properties. Therefore, it is natural to look into how the electronic
structure transitions between these bulk structures by using doping.
Measurements of the substitutional doped SrTi$_{\rm 1-x}$V$_{\rm x}$O$_3$ shows
an metal-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of doping. By using supercell
density functional theory with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), we show
that the MIT is indeed the result of the combination of local electron
correlation effects (Mott physics) within the t$_{\rm 2g}$ orbitals and the
atomic site configuration of the transition metals which may indicate
dependence on site disorder. SrTi$_{\rm 1-x}$V$_{\rm x}$O$_3$ may be an ideal
candidate for benchmarking cutting-edge Mott-Anderson models of real systems.
We show that applying an effective external perturbation on SrTi$_{\rm
1-x}$V$_{\rm x}$O$_3$ can switch the system between the insulating and metallic
phase, meaning this is a bulk system with the potential use in Mott electronic
devices.

Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number
of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify the same
numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique
which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the
constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series
expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of
operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We
use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as
various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our
updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the
algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a
Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales
involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence
of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.

<br>
<br>
The search for superconducting systems exhibiting nonreciprocal transport
and, specifically the diode effect, has proliferated in recent years. This
trend has encompassed a wide variety of systems, including planar hybrid
structures, asymmetric SQUIDs, and certain noncentrosymmetric superconductors.
A common feature of such systems is a gyroptropic symmetry, realized on
different scales and characterized by a polar vector. Alongside time-reversal
symmetry breaking, the presence of a polar axis allows for magnetoelectric
effects, which, when combined with proximity-induced superconductivity, results
in spontaneous non-dissipative currents that underpin the superconducting diode
effect. With this symmetry established, we present a comprehensive theoretical
study of transport in a lateral Josephson junctions composed of a normal metal
supporting the spin Hall effect, and attached to a ferromagnetic insulator. Due
to the presence of the latter, magnetoelectric effects arise without requiring
external magnetic fields. We determine the dependence of the anomalous currents
on the spin relaxation length and the transport parameters commonly used in
spintronics to characterize the interface between the metal and the
ferromagnetic insulator. Therefore, our theory naturally unifies nonreciprocal
transport in superconducting systems with classical spintronic effects, such as
the spin Hall effect, spin galvanic effect, and spin Hall magnetoresistance. We
propose an experiment involving measurements of magnetoresistance in the normal
state and nonreciprocal transport in the superconducting state. Such experiment
would allow for determining the parameters of the model and thus verifying with
a greater precision the theories of magnetoelectric effects in normal systems.
It would contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying microscopic
origins that determine these parameters.

<h3>Diffusion limited aggregation, resetting and large deviations of  Brownian motion</h3>

Models of fractal growth commonly consider particles diffusing in a medium
and that stick irreversibly to the forming aggregate when making contact for
the first time. As shown by the well-known diffusion limited aggregation (DLA)
model and its generalisations, the fractal dimension is sensitive to the nature
of the stochastic motion of the particles. Here, we study the structures formed
by finite-lived Brownian particles, i.e., particles constrained to find the
aggregate within a prescribed time, and which are removed otherwise. This
motion can be modelled by diffusion with stochastic resetting, a class of
processes which has been widely studied in recent years. In the short lifetime
limit, a very small fraction of the particles manage to reach the aggregate.
Hence, growth is controlled by atypical Brownian trajectories, that move nearly
in straight line according to a large deviation principle. In $d$ dimensions,
the resulting fractal dimension of the aggregate decreases from the DLA value
and tends to 1, instead of increasing to $d$ as expected from ballistic
aggregation. In the zero lifetime limit one recovers the non-trivial model of
"aggregation by the tips" proposed long ago by R. Jullien [J. Phys. A: Math.
Gen. 19, 2129 (1986)].

configurations. Using multifarious self-assembly as a model system, we
introduce a mechanism to escape kinetic traps by utilizing non-reciprocal
interactions between components. Introducing non-equilibrium effects offered by
broken action-reaction symmetry in the system, we can push the trajectory of
the system out of arrested dynamics. The dynamics of the model is studied using
tools from the physics of interfaces and defects. Our proposal can find
applications in self-assembly, glassy systems and systems with arrested
dynamics.

Observations of the anomalous Hall effect in RuO$_2$ and MnTe have
demonstrated unconventional time-reversal symmetry breaking in the electronic
structure of a recently identified new class of compensated collinear magnets,
dubbed altermagnets. While in MnTe the unconventional anomalous Hall signal
accompanied by a vanishing magnetization is observable at remanence, the
anomalous Hall effect in RuO$_2$ is excluded by symmetry for the N\'eel vector
pointing along the zero-field [001] easy-axis. Guided by a symmetry analysis
and ab initio calculations, a field-induced reorientation of the N\'eel vector
from the easy-axis towards the [110] hard-axis was used to demonstrate the
anomalous Hall signal in this altermagnet. We confirm the existence of an
anomalous Hall effect in our RuO$_2$ thin-film samples whose set of magnetic
and magneto-transport characteristics is consistent with the earlier report. By
performing our measurements at extreme magnetic fields up to 68 T, we reach
saturation of the anomalous Hall signal at a field $H_{\rm c} \simeq$ 55 T that
was inaccessible in earlier studies, but is consistent with the expected
N\'eel-vector reorientation field.

We experimentally demonstrate that well-designed driven lattices are
versatile tools to simultaneously tune multiple key parameters (namely
spin-dependent interactions, spinor phase, and Zeeman energy) for manipulating
phase diagrams of spinor gases with negligible heating and atom losses. This
opens a new avenue for studying dynamical phase transitions in engineered
Hamiltonians. The driven lattice creates additional separatrices in phase space
at driving-frequency-determined locations, with progressively narrower
separatrices at higher Zeeman energies due to modulation-induced higher
harmonics. The vastly expanded range of magnetic fields at which significant
spin dynamics occur and improved sensitivities at higher harmonics represent a
step towards quantum sensing with ultracold gases.

Motivated by the recent experimental realization of a two-particle fractional
quantum Hall state of ultracold atoms in a small optical lattice [Nature 619,
495 (2023)], we propose a minimal setup to create and observe a quasihole in
such a system. Adding a single-site repulsive potential to pin the quasihole
and superimposing a harmonic trap on top of the optical lattice to keep the
particles away from the system edge, we determine via exact diagonalization an
optimal range for system parameters such as the magnetic flux and the strengths
of the additional potentials that would favour the creation of the quasihole
state. We suggest that clear signatures of such a state with two or three
particles can be obtained through a standard density measurement.

(1) Introduction: Nanoparticles have multiple applications, including drug
delivery systems, biosensing, and carbon capture. Non-Einstein-like viscosity
reduction has been reported in nanoparticle-polymer blends at low nanoparticle
concentrations. More recently, a similar non-Einsteinian viscosity reduction
effect has been observed in aqueous ultra-low concentration carbon-based
nanofluids. (2) Methods: We use a boron nitride nanotube functionalized with
hydrophilic groups in rheological experiments to investigate the viscosity
reduction in ultra-low concentration nanofluids (0.1-10 ppm). We measure the
dynamic viscosity in an air atmosphere and methane (0-5 MPag) at low
temperatures (0-10 C). (3) Results: A negligible effect on the temperature
dependence of viscosity was found. Ultra-low concentrations of BNNT reduced the
viscosity of the nanofluid by up to 29% at 10 ppm in the presence of methane.
The results presented here were compared to similar studies on O-GNF and
O-MWCNT nanofluids, which also reported significant viscosity reductions. (4)
Conclusions: This work identified a non-Einsteinian viscosity reduction in BNNT
nanofluids, which was exacerbated by methane dissolved in the nanofluid.
