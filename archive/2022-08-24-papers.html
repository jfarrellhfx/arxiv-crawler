<h3>Realisation of the Brazil-nut effect in charged colloids without external driving</h3>

Sedimentation is a ubiquitous phenomenon across many fields of science, such
as geology, astrophysics, and soft matter. Sometimes, sedimentation leads to
unusual phenomena, such as the Brazil-nut effect, where heavier (granular)
particles reside on top of lighter particles after shaking. We show
experimentally for the first time that a Brazil-nut effect can be realised in a
binary colloidal system of long-range repulsive charged particles driven purely
by Brownian motion and electrostatics, without the need for activity. Using
theory, we argue that not only the mass-per-charge for the heavier particles
needs to be smaller than the mass-per-charge for the lighter particles, but
that at high overall density the system can be trapped in a long-lived
metastable state, which prevents the occurrence of the equilibrium Brazil-nut
effect. Therefore, we envision that our work provides valuable insights into
the physics of strongly interacting systems, such as partially glassy and
crystalline structures. Finally, our theory, that quantitatively agrees with
the experimental data, predicts that the shapes of sedimentation density
profiles of multicomponent charged colloids is greatly altered when the
particles are charge regulating with more than two ion species involved. Hence,
we hypothesise that sedimentation experiments can aid in revealing the type of
ion-adsorption processes that determine the particle charge, and possibly also
the value of the corresponding equilibrium constants.

<br>
<i>Liang Si, Paul Worm, Karsten Held</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite enormous experimental and theoretical efforts, obtaining generally
accepted conclusions regarding the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties
of superconducting nickleates remains extremely challenging. Experiments show a
large degrees of uncertainty, indicating hidden factors in the synthesized
films which call for further investigations. Here, we reveal the formation of
one-dimensional hydrogen chains in infinite-layers LaNiO$_2$ superconductors
using density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT)
calculations. The formation of such hydrogen chains induces a coexistence of
different oxidation states of Ni and competing magnetic phases. Furthermore it
contributes to the difficulty of synthesizing homogeneous nickelates and of
determining their ground states. The smoking gun to detect access hydrogen in
nickleates are flat phonon modes, which are quite insensible to the exact
arrangement of the H atoms.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11070v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11070v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Monte Carlo simulations of systems of particles such as hard spheres or soft
spheres with singular kernels can display around a phase transition
prohibitively long convergence times when using traditional Hasting-Metropolis
reversible schemes. Efficient algorithms known as event-chain Monte Carlo were
then developed to reach necessary accelerations. They are based on
non-reversible continuous-time Markov processes. Proving invariance and
ergodicity for such schemes cannot be done as for discrete-time schemes and a
theoretical framework to do so was lacking, impeding the generalisation of ECMC
algorithms to more sophisticated systems or processes. In this work, we
characterize the Markov processes generated in ECMC as piecewise deterministic
Markov processes. It first allows us to propose more general schemes, for
instance regarding the direction refreshment. We then prove the invariance of
the correct stationary distribution. Finally, we show the ergodicity of the
processes in soft- and hard-sphere systems, with a density condition for the
latter.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11037v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11037v1</a>
<br>
<i>Chengjie Luo, Joshua F. Robinson, Ilian Pihlajamaa, Vincent E. Debets, C. Patrick Royall, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen</i>
<br>
<br>
It is widely believed that the emergence of slow glassy dynamics is encoded
in a material's microstructure. First-principles theory [mode-coupling theory
(MCT)] is able to predict the dramatic slowdown of the dynamics from only
static two-point correlations as input, yet it cannot capture all of the
observed dynamical behavior. Here we go beyond two-point spatial correlation
functions by extending MCT systematically to include higher-order static and
dynamic correlations. We demonstrate that only adding the static triplet direct
correlations already qualitatively changes the predicted glass-transition
diagram of binary hard spheres and silica. Moreover, we find a non-trivial
competition between static triplet correlations that work to stabilize the
glass state, and dynamic higher-order correlations which destabilize it for
both materials. We conclude that the conventionally neglected static triplet
direct correlations as well as higher-order dynamic correlations are in fact
non-negligible in both fragile and strong glassformers.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11031v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11031v1</a>
<br>
<i>Sanjay Gopalan, Maarten L. Van de Put, Gautam Gaddemane, Massimo V. Fischetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss the effect of the dielectric environment (insulators and metal
gates) on electronic transport in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMD) monolayers. We employ well-known ab initio methods to
calculate the low-field carrier mobility in free-standing layers and use the
dielectric continuum approximation to extend our study to layers in double-gate
structures, including the effects of dielectric screening of the
electron-phonon interaction caused by the bottom oxide and the gate insulator,
and of scattering with hybrid interface optical-phonon/plasmon excitations
(`remote phonon scattering'). We find that the presence of insulators with a
high dielectric constant may improve significantly the carrier mobility.
However, scattering with the interface hybrid excitations negates this gain and
degrades the mobility significantly below its free-standing value. In a
double-gate geometry with SiO$_{2}$ as bottom-oxide and various top-gate
insulators, we find that the mobility decreases as the top-insulator dielectric
constant increases, as expected. However, a high mobility is predicted in the
case of the weakly polar hBN, and a mobility much lower than expected is
calculated in the case of gate-insulator/TMD/bottom-oxide stacks in which two
or more polar materials have optical-phonon with similar resonating
frequencies. We also find that the effect of screening by metal gates is
noticeable but not particularly strong. Finally, we discuss the effect of the
TMD dielectric constant, of the free-carrier density, and of temperature on the
transport properties of TMD monolayers.

</body><h3>Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model: Non-self-averaging properties of the energy spectrum</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11008v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11008v1</a>
<br>
<i>Richard Berkovits</i>
<br>
<br>
The short time (large energy) behavior of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK)
is one of the main motivation to the growing interest garnered by this model.
True chaotic behaviour sets in at the Thouless time, which can be extracted
from the energy spectrum. In order to do so, it is necessary to unfold the
spectrum, i.e., to filter out global tendencies. Using a simple ensemble
average for unfolding results in a parametically low estimation of the Thouless
energy. By examining the behavior of the spectrum as the distribution of the
matrix elements is changed into a log-normal distribution it is shown that the
sample to sample level spacing variance determines this estimation of the
Thouless energy. Using the singular value decomposition method, SVD, which
filters out these sample to sample fluctuations, the Thouless energy becomes
parametrically much larger, essentially of order of the band width. It is shown
that the SYK model in non-self-averaging even in the thermodynamic limit which
must be taken into account in considering its short time properties.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10994v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10994v1</a>
<br>
<i>Tru Sakai, Ryosuke Nakanishi, Takaharu Yamada, Rito Furuchi, Hiroki Nakano, Hirono Kaneyasu, Kiyomi Okamoto, Takashi Tonegawa</i>
<br>
<br>
The $S=1/2$ quantum spin ladder system with the anisotropic ferromagnetic
exchange interaction on the rung under magnetic field is investigated using the
numerical diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
analyses. It is found that the nematic-spin-correlation-dominant
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) appears in some high magnetic field. It is
included in the TLL phase where the two-magnon bound state is realized. For
some suitable parameters, after the field-induced phase transition from this
two-magnon-bound TLL phase to the single-magnon TLL one, the re-entrant
transition to the two-magnon-bound TLL phase occurs, which is confirmed by the
magnetization curves by the DMRG. Several phase diagrams on the plane of the
coupling anisotropy versus the magnetization and the magnetic field are
presented. The present result is a proposal of the candidate system which
exhibits the spin nematic phase without the biquadratic interaction or the
frustration.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10991v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10991v1</a>
<br>
<i>Somesh Chandra Ganguli, Markus Aapro, Shawulienu Kezilebieke, Mohammad Amini, Jose L. Lado, Peter Liljeroth</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional magnetic materials provide an ideal platform to explore
collective many-body excitations associated with spin fluctuations. In
particular, it should be feasible to explore, manipulate and ultimately design
magnonic excitations in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets in a controllable
way. Here we demonstrate the emergence of moir\'e magnon excitations, stemming
from the interplay of spin-excitations in monolayer CrBr$_3$ and the moir\'e
pattern stemming from the lattice mismatch with the underlying substrate. The
existence of moir\'e magnons is further confirmed via inelastic quasiparticle
interference, showing the appearance of a dispersion pattern correlated with
the moir\'e length scale. Our results provide a direct visualization in
real-space of the dispersion of moir\'e magnons, demonstrating the versatility
of moir\'e patterns in creating emerging many-body excitations.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10988v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10988v1</a>
<br>
<i>Takashi Tonegawa, Kiyomi Okamoto, Kiyohide Nomura, Tru Sakai</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the $S=1/2$
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic bond-alternating chain, in which the
ferromagnetic interactions are stronger than the antiferromagnetic ones, and
the anisotropies of the former and latter interactions are of the Ising-type
and the $XY$-type, respectively. We use various numerical methods, such as the
level spectroscopy and phenomenological renormalization-group analyses of the
numerical data obtained by the exact diagonalization method, and so on. The
resultant phase diagrams contain the ferromagnetic, $XY$1, singlet-dimer, and
up-up-down-down phases as well as the nematic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (nTLL)
phase which appears in a wide region of the interaction parameters.
Perturbation calculations from the strong limit of the ferromagnetic
interactions reproduce fairly well the numerical results of the phase boundary
lines associated with the nTLL phase in the phase diagrams.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10987v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10987v1</a>
<br>
<i>Stephen Carr, Ilija K. Nikolov, Rong Cong, Adrian Del Maestro, Chandrasekhar Ramanathan, V. F. Mitrovi</i>
<br>
<br>
To understand a phase transition, independent measurement of the value and
variation in each physical parameter of a material's Hamiltonian is vital.
Conventional one-dimensional spectroscopy, which studies responses to fields as
a function of an experiment time ($t$), struggles to distinguish between
different sources of noise, but multi-dimensional spectroscopy can directly
probe individual Hamiltonian parameters by varying an integration time
($\tau$). In this work, we present a spectroscopic technique based on the
multi-dimensional paradigm, and show it can probe the distribution of a
quadrupolar interaction strength ($\mathcal{S}_z^2$) even in the presence of
large magnetic noise ($\mathcal{S}_z$). Inversion symmetric combinations of
spin operators are found to give clear sinusoidal responses in $\tau$ due to
periodic refocusing. The time-scale on which the magnetization partially decays
in $\tau$ provides a direct measure of the distribution of interaction
strengths, even when the average value of the interaction is zero across a
sample. A derivation of this effect for general spin magnitudes is included.
This provides an ideal method for assessing the distribution and source of
different forms of disorder, helping elucidate which microscopic physics and
symmetry dominates near a phase transition.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10983v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10983v1</a>
<br>
<i>Takaharu Yamada, Ryosuke Nakanishi, Rito Furuchi, Hiroki Nakano, Hirono Kaneyasu, Kiyomi Okamoto, Takashi Tonegawa, Tru Sakai</i>
<br>
<br>
The magnetization plateau of the $S=2$ antiferromagnetic chain with
interaction and single-ion anisotropies is investigated using the numerical
diagonalization of finite-size clusters and some size scaling analyses. The
previous level spectroscopy analysis indicated that two different magnetization
plateau phases appear at half of the saturation magnetization. One is due to
the large-$D$ mechanism and the other is due to the Haldane one. In the present
study the phase diagram is extended to wider region of the anisotropies. As a
result we find another half magnetization plateau phase, where the
translational symmetry is spontaneously broken .

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10972v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10972v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jheng-Wei Li, Andreas Gleis, Jan von Delft</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a controlled bond expansion (CBE) approach to simulate quantum
dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) for matrix
product states. Our method alleviates the numerical difficulties of the
standard, fixed-rank one-site TDVP integrator by increasing bond dimensions on
the fly to reduce the projection error. This is achieved in an economical,
local fashion, requiring only minor modifications of standard one-site TDVP
implementations. We illustrate the performance of CBE--TDVP with several
numerical examples on finite quantum lattices.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10923v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10923v1</a>
<br>
<i>Korbinian Baumgaertl, Dirk Grundler</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite the unprecedented downscaling of CMOS integrated circuits,
memory-intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence applications are
limited by data conversion between memory and processor. There is a challenging
quest for novel approaches to overcome this so-called von Neumann bottleneck.
Magnons are the quanta of spin waves and transport angular momenta through
magnets. They enable power-efficient computation without charge flow and would
solve the conversion problem if spin wave amplitudes could be stored directly
in a magnetic memory cell. Here, we report the reversal of ferromagnetic
nanostripes by spin waves which propagate through an underlying spin-wave bus
made from yttrium iron garnet. Thereby, the charge-free angular momentum flow
is stored after transmission over a macroscopic distance. We show that spin
waves can reverse large arrays of ferromagnetic stripes at a strikingly small
power level of nW. Combined with the already existing wave logic, our discovery
is path-breaking for the new era of magnonics-based in-memory computation and
beyond von Neumann computer architectures.

The Fermi surface topology plays an important role in the macroscopic
properties of metals. It can be particularly sensitive to electron correlation,
which appears to be especially significant for the weak itinerant ferromagnet
ZrZn$_{2}$. Here, we look at the differences in the predicted Fermi surface
sheets of this metallic compound in its paramagnetic phase for both density
functional theory (DFT) and the combination of DFT with dynamical mean field
theory (DFT+DMFT). The theoretical spectral functions evaluated at the Fermi
level were used along with calculations of the electron-positron momentum
density (also known as the two-photon momenutm density) in $k$-space to provide
insights into the origin of certain features of the Fermi surface topology. We
compare this two photon momentum density to that extracted from the positron
annihilation experimental data (Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 107003 (2004)). The
DFT+DMFT densities are in better agreement with the experiment than the DFT,
particularly with regard to the flat bands around the $L$ and $W$ high symmetry
points. The experimental neck around $L$, which relates to a van Hove
singularity, is present in DFT+DMFT but not in the DFT. We find that these flat
bands, and as such the Fermi surface topology, are sensitive to the many body
electron correlation description, and show that the positron annihilation
technique is able to probe this. This description is significant for the
observed behavior such as the Lifshiftz transition around the quantum critical
point.

We propose a universal framework to compute record age statistics of a
stochastic time-series that undergoes random restarts. The proposed framework
makes minimal assumptions on the underlying process and is furthermore suited
to treat generic restart protocols going beyond Markovian setting. After
benchmarking the framework for classical random walks on the $1$D lattice, we
derive a universal criterion underpinning the impact of restart on the age of
the $n$th record for generic time-series with nearest-neighbor transitions.
Crucially, the criterion contains a penalty of order $n$, that puts strong
constraints on restart expediting the creation of records, as compared to the
simple first passage completion. The applicability of our approach is further
demonstrated on an aggregation-shattering process where we compute the typical
growth rates of aggregate sizes. This unified framework paves the way to
explore record statistics of time-series under restart in a wide range of
complex systems.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10856v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10856v1</a>

We theoretically investigate asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different
current-phase relations in the two Josephson junctions, involving higher
Josephson harmonics. Our main focus is on the "minimal model" with one junction
in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the
other one featuring additional second harmonic. The current-voltage
characteristic (CVC) turns out to be asymmetric, $I(-V) \neq -I(V)$. The
asymmetry is due to the presence of the second harmonic and depends on the
magnetic flux through the interferometer loop, vanishing only at special values
of the flux such as integer or half-integer in the units of the flux quantum.
The system thus demonstrates the flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (JDE), the
simplest manifestations of which is the direction dependence of the critical
current. We analyze asymmetry of the overall $I(V)$ shape both in the absence
and in the presence of external ac irradiation. In the voltage-source case of
external signal, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro spikes. The integer spikes
are asymmetric (manifestation of the JDE) while the half-integer spikes remain
symmetric. In the current-source case, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro steps.
The JDE manifests itself in asymmetry of the overall CVC shape, including
integer and half-integer steps.

We study the effects of periodic driving of a one-dimensional model with a
quasiperiodic potential $V_0$ and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes which
have a uniform term which varies periodically in time with frequency $\omega$
and a staggered term which is time-independent. We find numerically that there
are multiple mobility gaps in the Floquet spectrum of such a model that
separate different bands of quasienergies. We also find that there are ranges
of $\omega$ and $V_0$ where there are multifractal states whose generalized
inverse participation ratios scale with the system size with exponents which
are different from the values for both extended and localized states. We see
re-entrant transitions between the different kinds of states when $\omega$ and
$V_0$ are varied. The presence of such states is also confirmed by the behavior
of the Shannon entropy. Many of our numerical results can be understood from an
analytic Floquet Hamiltonian derived using a Floquet perturbation theory that
uses the inverse of the driving amplitude as the perturbation parameter. In the
limit of high frequency and large driving amplitude, we find that the Floquet
quasienergies match the energies of the undriven system, but the Floquet
eigenstates are much more extended. We also study the spreading of a
one-particle wave packet and find that it is always ballistic but the ballistic
velocity varies significantly with the system parameters, sometimes showing a
non-monotonic dependence on $V_0$. Finally, we compare the results for the
model with staggered hopping amplitudes with a model with uniform hopping
amplitudes, and we find some significant differences between the two cases.
