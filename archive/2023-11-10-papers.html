<h3>Impact of Exchange-Correlation Functionals on Phonon Hydrodynamics: A  Study of Fluorides (NaF, LiF) and Alkali Hydrides (LiH, NaH) Under Guyer's  Criteria</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05107" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05107</a>

<i>Jamal Abou Haibeh, Samuel Huberman</i>
<p>In this study, we examine the effect of various exchange-correlation (XC)
functionals, including the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient
approximation (PBE), the modified Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient
approximation (PBESOL), and the local density approximation (LDA), on the
calculations of electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of sodium
fluoride (NaF), lithium fluoride (LiF), lithium hydride (LiH), and sodium
hydride (NaH). The lattice thermal conductivity is computed based on an
iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Guyer's criteria
\cite{Guyer1966} is applied to predict the phonon hydrodynamics regime. Based
on our calculations, second sound in NaF can be observed at a temperature of 15
K, in agreement with previous experimental observations from Jackson et al.
\cite{Jackson1970}. The impact of isotopes on the calculated lattice thermal
conductivity and phonon hydrodynamics windows is also reported. We find that
the selection of a functional impacts the prediction of thermal conductivity
and the window for observation of phonon hydrodynamics.

<h3>Moiré Fractional Chern Insulators I: First-principles calculations and  Continuum Models of Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04958</a>
<br>
<i>Yujin Jia, Jiabin Yu, Jiaxuan Liu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Ziyue Qi, Nicolas Regnault, Hongming Weng, B. Andrei Bernevig, Quansheng Wu</i>
<p>Recent experiments observed fractional Chern insulators (FCI) in twisted
bilayer MoTe$_2$ at zero magnetic field, yet even the single-particle model of
this material is controversial, leading to unreliable predictions of the
experimental phase diagram as discussed in [Yu et al., 2023]. In this light, we
revisit the single-particle model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. Utilizing
large-scale density functional theory, we calculate the band structure of
twisted AA-stacked bilayer MoTe$_2$ at various twist angles relevant to
experiment. We find that a band inversion occurs near $4.41^\circ$ between the
second and third bands. Our ab initio band structure is in qualitative
agreement with [Wang et al., 2023], but shows important differences in the
remote bands and in the $\Gamma$ valley. We incorporate two higher harmonic
terms into the continuum model to capture the highest 3 valence bands per
valley. We confirm that the two highest valence bands per valley have opposite
Chern numbers with $|C|=1$ for small angles, and also use our model to predict
a variety of Chern states in the remote bands accessible by displacement field.
Finally, we perform DFT calculations and build models for the AB stacking
configuration. Our work serves as a foundation for accurate determination of
the correlated phases in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.

<h3>Classification of Dipolar Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: Matrix  Product States, Stabilizer Hamiltonians and Finite Tensor Gauge Theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04962" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04962</a>
<br>
<i>Ho Tat Lam</i>
<p>We classify one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases
protected by dipole symmetries. A dipole symmetry comprises two sets of
symmetry generators: charge and dipole operators, which together form a
non-trivial algebra with translations. Using matrix product states (MPS), we
show that for a $G$ dipole symmetry with $G$ a finite abelian group, the
one-dimensional dipolar SPTs are classified by the group $H^2[G\times
G,U(1)]/H^2[G,U(1)]^2$. Because of the symmetry algebra, the MPS tensors
exhibit an unusual property, prohibiting the fractionalization of charge
operators at the edges. For each phase in the classification, we explicitly
construct a stabilizer Hamiltonian to realize the SPT phase and derive the
response field theories by coupling the dipole symmetry to background tensor
gauge fields. These field theories generalize the Dijkgraaf-Witten theories to
twisted finite tensor gauge theories.

<h3>The Glass Transition of Quantum Hard Spheres in High Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04968" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04968</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Winer, Christopher L. Baldwin, Richard Barney, Victor Galitski, Brian Swingle</i>
<p>We study the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum hard spheres in the
infinite-dimensional limit, determining the boundary between liquid and glass
phases in the temperature-density plane by means of the Franz-Parisi potential.
We find that as the temperature decreases from high values, the effective
radius of the spheres is enhanced by a multiple of the thermal de Broglie
wavelength, thus increasing the effective filling fraction and decreasing the
critical density for the glass phase. Numerical calculations show that the
critical density continues to decrease monotonically as the temperature
decreases further, suggesting that the system will form a glass at sufficiently
low temperatures for any density.

<h3>Theory of topological exciton insulators and condensates in flat Chern  bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04970</a>
<br>
<i>Hong-Yi Xie, Pouyan Ghaemi, Matteo Mitrano, Bruno Uchoa</i>
<p>Exciton states of interacting Chern insulators may inherit nontrivial
topology and quantum geometry from the underlying electron wavefunctions. We
theoretically investigate the excitonic bound states and superfluidity in
flat-band insulators pumped by a monochromatic light. As long as two bands
possess contrasting Chern numbers, their exciton wavefunctions exhibit vortex
structures in momentum space, where the total vorticity equals to the
difference of Chern numbers between the conduction and valence bands. Moreover,
both the exciton binding energy and the exciton superfluid density are
proportional to the Brillouin-zone average of the quantum metric and the
Coulomb potential energy per unit cell. Spontaneous emission of circularly
polarized light from radiative decay is a detectable signature of the exciton
vorticity. Based on a Corbino geometry, we propose that the exciton vorticity
is also signaled by the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, whereas the exciton
superfluidity can be measured by voltage-drop quantization attributed to the
Aharonov-Casher effect. Topological excitons could be realized in flat bands of
gate-tuned Van der Waals layered materials such as twisted bilayer graphene and
possibly moire heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides.

<h3>Depth resolved study of annealing in IrMn/(Fe, Co, CoFe) exchange bias  systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu. Khaydukov, A. Dobrynin, S. Hassan, M. Ormston, K. Nikolaev, P. Bencok, R. Fan, P. Steadman, A. Csik, A. Vorobiev</i>
<p>Depth resolved study of structural and magnetic profiles of
antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) system upon annealing was performed in
this work. We studied systems comprising of AFM IrMn and FM (Co, Fe,
Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$) structures using polarized neutron and soft X-ray
scattering, secondary neutral spectrometry, and magnetometry. Structural depth
profiles obtained from neutron reflectometry indicate non-homogeneity of the
AFM layer even before annealing, which is associated with the migration of
manganese to the surface of the sample along grain boundaries. Annealing of
samples with CoFe and Co layers leads to a slight increase in the migration of
manganese, which, however, does not lead to significant degradation of the
exchange coupling at the AFM/FM interface. A significantly different picture
was observed in the Fe/IrMn systems where a strong migration of iron into the
AFM layer was observed upon annealing of the sample, leading to erosion of the
magnetic profile, the formation of a non-magnetic alloy and degradation of the
pinning strength. This study can be useful in the design of AF/FM systems in
different spintronics devices, including HDD read heads, where thermal
annealing is applied at different stages of the device manufacturing process.

<h3>Probing carrier and phonon transport in semiconductors all at once  through frequency-domain photo-reflectance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04998</a>
<br>
<i>Qichen Song, Sorren Warkander, Samuel C. Huberman</i>
<p>Semiconductor devices favor high carrier mobility for reduced Joule heating
and high thermal conductivity for rapid heat dissipation. The ability to
accurately characterize the motion of charge carriers and heat carriers is
necessary to improve the performance of electronic devices. However, the
conventional approaches of measuring carrier mobility and thermal conductivity
require separate and independent measurement techniques. These techniques often
involve invasive probing, such as depositing thin metal films on the sample as
Ohmic contacts for characterizing electrical transport or as optical
transducers for characterizing thermal transport, which becomes more cumbersome
as the geometry of the semiconductor devices becomes small and complicated.
Here we demonstrate a non-contact frequency-domain pump-probe method that
requires no sample pretreatment to simultaneously probe carrier and phonon
transport. We find that the optical reflectance depends on both excess carriers
and phonons in response to exposure to a modulated continuous-wave pump laser
source. By modeling the ambipolar diffusion of photo-induced excess carriers,
energy transfer between electrons and phonons, and phonon diffusion, we are
able to extract temperature-dependent electrical and thermal transport
coefficients in Si, Ge, SiGe and GaAs. The intrinsically weak perturbation from
the continuous-wave pump laser avoids invoking the highly nonequilibrium
transport regime that may arise when using a pulsed laser and allows for
accurate assessment of electrical transport in actual devices. Our approach
provides a convenient and accurate platform for the study of the charge
transport and energy dissipation in semiconductors.

<h3>Quantum Phase Transitions in Skewed Ladder Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05000" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05000</a>
<br>
<i>Sambunath Das, Dayasindhu Dey, Rajamani Raghunathan, Zoltán G. Soos, Manoranjan Kumar, S. Ramasesha</i>
<p>In this brief review, we introduce a new spin ladder system called skewed
spin ladders and discuss the exotic quantum phases of this system. The spin
ladders studied are the 5/7, 3/4 and 3/5 systems corresponding to alternately
fused 5 and 7 membered rings; 3 and 4 membered rings; and 3 and 5 membered
rings. These ladders show completely different behaviour as the Hamiltonian
model parameter is changed. When the Hamiltonian parameter is increased the 5/7
ladder switches from an initial singlet ground state to progressively higher
spin ground state and then to a reentrant singlet state before finally settling
to the highest spin ground state whose spin equals the number of unit cells in
the system. The 3/4 ladder goes from a singlet ground state to a high spin
ground state with each unit cell contributing spin 1 to the state, as the model
parameter is increased. The 3/5 ladder shows a singlet ground state for small
parameters and high spin ground state for intermediate values of the parameter
and for still higher parameters, a reentrant singlet ground state. They can
also show interesting magnetization plateaus as illustrated by studies on a
specific spin ladder.

<h3>Fluctuation-induced spin nematic order in magnetic charge-ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05004</a>
<br>
<i>A. Hemmatzade, K. Essafi, M. Taillefumier, M. Müller, T. Fennell, P. M. Derlet</i>
<p>Disorder in materials may be used to tune their functionalities, but much
more strikingly, its presence can entail entirely new behavior. This happens in
charge-ice where structural disorder is not weak and local, but strong and
long-range correlated. Here, two cations of different charge occupy a
pyrochlore lattice, arranging themselves such that all tetrahedra host two
cations of each type. The ensuing correlated disorder is characterized by
randomly packed loops of a single cation-type. If the cations are magnetic and
interact antiferromagnetically, a new type of magnet with strong interactions
along the loops, but frustrated interactions between loops, emerges. This
results in an ensemble of intertwined Heisenberg spin chains that form an
algebraic spin liquid at intermediate temperatures. At lower temperatures, we
find these non-local degrees of freedom undergo a discontinuous transition to a
spin nematic. While this phase does not break time reversal symmetry, its spin
symmetry is reduced resulting in a dramatically slower spin relaxation. The
transition is sensitive to the statistics of the cation loops, providing both a
direct thermodynamic signature of otherwise elusive structural information and
a structural route to engineering nematic phase stability.

<h3>Thermalization of radiation-induced electrons in wide-bandgap materials:  A first-principles approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05011" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05011</a>
<br>
<i>Dallin O. Nielsen, Massimo V. Fischetti</i>
<p>The present study is concerned with simulating the thermalization of
high-energy charge carriers (electrons and/or electron-hole pairs), generated
by ionizing radiation, in diamond and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Computational tools
developed by the nuclear/particle physics and electronic device communities
allow for accurate simulation of charge-carrier transport and thermalization in
the high-energy (exceeding $\sim100$ eV) and low-energy (below $\sim10$ eV)
regimes, respectively. Between these energy regimes, there is an intermediate
energy range of about 10-100 eV, which we call the "10-100 eV gap", in which
the energy-loss processes are historically not well-studied or understood. To
close this "gap", we use a first-principles approach (density functional
theory) to calculate the band structure of diamond and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ up
to $\sim100$ eV along with the phonon dispersion, carrier-phonon matrix
elements, and dynamic dielectric function. Additionally, using first-order
perturbation theory (Fermi's Golden Rule/first Born approximation), we
calculate the carrier-phonon scattering rates and the carrier energy-loss rates
(impact ionization and plasmon scattering). With these data, we simulate the
thermalization of 100-eV electrons and the generated electron-hole pairs by
solving the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation using Monte Carlo
techniques. We find that electron thermalization is complete within $\sim0.4$
and $\sim1.0$ ps for diamond and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, respectively, while holes
thermalize within $\sim0.5$ ps for both. We also calculate electron-hole pair
creation energies of 12.87 and 11.24 eV, respectively.

<h3>The role of Debye temperature in achieving large adiabatic temperature  changes at cryogenic temperatures: a case study on $Pr_2In$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05022" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05022</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Liu, Franziska Scheibel, Nuno Fortunato, Imants Dirba, Tino Gottschall, Hongbin Zhang, Konstantin Skokov, Oliver Gutfleisch</i>
<p>The excellent magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) in the temperature range
of 20 $\sim$ 77 K due to the first-order phase transition makes $Pr_2In$ an
intriguing candidate for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. As an equally
important magnetocaloric parameter, the adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta
T_{ad}$) of $Pr_2In$ associated with the first-order phase transition has not
yet been reported. In this work, the $\Delta T_{ad}$ of $Pr_2In$ is obtained
from heat capacity measurements: 2 K in fields of 2 T and 4.3 K in fields of 5
T. While demonstrating a $\Delta T_{ad}$ that is not as impressive as its
remarkable $\Delta S_T$, $Pr_2In$ exhibits an unusual low Debye temperature
($T_D$) of around 110 K. Based on these two observations, an approach that
combines the mean-field and Debye models is developed to study the correlation
between $\Delta T_{ad}$ and $T_D$. The role of $T_D$ in achieving large $\Delta
T_{ad}$ is revealed: materials with higher $T_D$ tend to exhibit larger $\Delta
T_{ad}$, particularly in the cryogenic temperature range. This discovery
explains the absence of an outstanding $\Delta T_{ad}$ in $Pr_2In$ and can
serve as a tool for designing or searching materials with both a large $\Delta
S_T$ and a $\Delta T_{ad}$.

<h3>Quadrupolar Phases and Plateau States In Skewed Ladders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05031</a>
<br>
<i>Sambunath Das, Dayasindhu Dey, Manoranjan Kumar, S. Ramasesha</i>
<p>Exotic quantum phases in low dimensional frustrated quantum magnets emerge
due to strong quantum fluctuations and competing spin exchanges. Two legged
skewed spin ladders with periodically missing rung bonds and periodically
placed slanted rung bonds are particularly interesting from this stand point.
Here, we study ground state (gs) properties of a spin- 1/2 Heisenberg model on
3/4, 3/5 and 5/5 skewed ladders in the presence of an axial magnetic field, B,
using exact diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group
method. We note the existence of plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 for 3/4 skewed
ladder, at m = 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for 3/5 skewed ladder, and at m = 0, 1/3, and
2/3 for 5/5 skewed ladder. The plateau state is always a gapped state and it
depends on the gap in the system. Surprisingly, the 3/4 and 5/5 skewed ladders
show interesting quadrupolar or n-type spin nematic phases below the 1/3rd
plateau, i.e, at very low magnetic fields. These two systems are unique as they
host both a plateau and a quadrupolar phase at low magnetic fields. The linear
variation of pitch angle of the spin with magnetization and behavior of binding
energy of magnon pairs as function of magnetic field are also studied in both
the systems.

<h3>Ginzburg-Landau energy of multiband superconductors with interband  pairing</h3>

<br>
<i>K. V. Samokhin</i>
<p>We derive microscopically the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional for a
superconductor in which the Cooper pairs are formed not only by quasiparticles
from the same band, but also by quasiparticles from different bands. In the
simplest case of an s-wave or d-wave pairing in a two-band system, the order
parameter has three components describing two intraband and one interband pair
condensates. The interband pairing-specific terms in the free energy bring
about some qualitative changes in the phase diagram, for example, time-reversal
symmetry breaking superconducting states are stabilized at low temperatures.

<h3>Temperature-induced suppression of structural disproportionation in  paramagnetic quantum materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05053" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05053</a>
<br>
<i>Himanshu Joshi, Mateusz Wlazło, Harshan Reddy Gopidi, Oleksandr I. Malyi</i>
<p>With the development of electronic structure theory, a new class of materials
- quantum ones has been recognized by the community. Traditionally, it has been
believed that the properties of such compounds cannot be described within the
framework of modern density functional theory, and indeed, more advanced
post-mean-field theory methods are needed. Motivated by this, herein, we
develop a fundamental understanding of such complex materials using the example
of paramagnetic YNiO3, which is experimentally known to exhibit
metal-to-insulator phase transition. We show that this material has a
temperature-dependent distribution of local structural and spin motifs. Thus,
while at low temperatures, YNiO3 has distinct structural disproportionation
with the formation of large and small octahedra, as the temperature increases,
this disproportionation is suppressed. We also explain the paramagnetic
monoclinic to paramagnetic orthorhombic phase transition within the double-well
to single-well energy profile, predicting the variation of the corresponding
energy profile as a function of octahedral size distribution. In this way, we
demonstrate a fundamental understanding of structural phase transitions in
quantum materials, giving insight into how it can be used for different
applications and what minimum level of theory is needed to describe such types
of complex materials correctly.

<h3>Composite-fermion pairing at half and quarter filled lowest Landau level</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05083</a>
<br>
<i>Anirban Sharma, Ajit C. Balram, J. K. Jain</i>
<p>The Halperin-Lee-Read Fermi sea of composite fermions (CFs) at half-filled
lowest Landau level is the realization of a fascinating non-Fermi liquid
metallic phase. Remarkably, experiments have found that as the width of the
quantum well is increased, this state makes a transition into a fractional
quantum Hall (FQH) state, the origin of which has remained an important puzzle
since its discovery more than three decades ago. We perform detailed and
accurate quantitative calculations using a systematic variational framework for
the pairing of CFs that closely mimics the BCS theory of superconductivity. We
find: (i) as the quantum-well width is increased, the single-component CF Fermi
sea occupying the lowest symmetric subband of the quantum well undergoes an
instability into a single-component p-wave paired state of CFs; (ii) the
theoretical phase diagram in the quantum-well width - electron density plane is
in excellent agreement with experiments; (iii) a sufficient amount of asymmetry
in the charge distribution of the quantum well destroys the FQH effect, as
observed experimentally; and (iv) the two-component 331 state is energetically
less favorable than the single component paired state. Evidence for FQH effect
has been seen in wide quantum wells also at quarter-filled lowest Landau level;
here our calculations indicate an f-wave paired state of CFs. We further
investigate bosons in the lowest Landau level at filling factor equal to one
and show that a p-wave pairing instability of CFs, which are bosons carrying a
single flux quantum, in agreement with exact diagonalization studies. The
general consistency of the composite-fermion BCS approach with experiments
lends support to the notion of CF pairing as the mechanism of FQH effects at
even-denominator filling factors. Various experimental implications are
mentioned.

<h3>Universal wrinkling of freestanding atomically thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05096" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05096</a>
<br>
<i>Jaehyung Yu, Colin Scheibner, Ce Liang, Thomas A. Witten, Vincenzo Vitelli, Jiwoong Park</i>
<p>Atomically thin films, like transition metal dichalcogenides, can now be
synthesized at wafer scale, achieving the same extreme aspect ratio (~10^8)
that a sheet of paper would have if it covered an entire city. Yet, the
intrinsic (i.e. unconfined) three-dimensional shape of these extreme membranes
remains a mystery because of the very fundamentals of mechanical measurements:
to measure such an ultra-thin film, one first needs to simultaneously free it
and stabilize it without introducing confining boundaries. Here, we introduce a
counter-intuitive solution to this problem: place atomically thin films on
water. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy adapted to
water's surface, we reveal that large-scale freestanding membranes
spontaneously self-wrinkle into a universal mechanical state with long emergent
length scales that follow robust scaling trends. Our analytical and numerical
models suggest that these universal trends are controlled by mesoscopic
parameters of the polycrystalline domains instead of atomistic details.
Moreover, we demonstrate experimentally that the wrinkles result in a large and
tunable reduction of elastic stiffness by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The
present work illuminates the physical properties of the world's thinnest
materials at length scales never probed before and highlights their potential
for tunable strain-controlled nanomechanical devices.

<h3>Impact of thermal annealing on the interaction between monolayer MoS2  and Au</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05104</a>
<br>
<i>Stephanie Lough, Jesse E. Thompson, Darian Smalley, Rahul Rao, Masahiro Ishigami</i>
<p>We have investigated the impact of thermal annealing on the interaction of
single layer MoS2 and Au using Raman Spectroscopy. We found MoS2 has two main
modes of interactions with the underlying Au being either weakly-coupled or
strongly-coupled. The regions strongly-coupled to Au are hybridized to Au,
minimally strained, and electron-doped. The weakly-coupled regions are found to
be slightly hole-doped with tensile strain of 1.0 %. The observed nanoscale
inhomogeneities in doping would result in Au contacts having a large
variability in performance. The overall areal coverage of the strongly-coupled
regions is not increased by thermal annealing, and the variability in the
degree of hybridization increases at annealing temperatures above 100 {\deg}C.
Our data also show that monolayer MoS2 starts to decouple from Au around 100
{\deg}C, becoming fully decoupled above 250 {\deg}C, suggesting that monolayer
MoS2 produced by Au-assisted mechanical exfoliation may be more easily
transferred off Au at elevated temperatures.

<h3>High-mobility compensated semimetals, orbital magnetization, and umklapp  scattering in bilayer graphene moire superlattices</h3>

<p>Twist-controlled moire superlattices (MS) have emerged as a versatile
platform in which to realize artificial systems with complex electronic
spectra. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) and hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) form an interesting example of the MS that has recently featured a set of
unexpected behaviors, such as unconventional ferroelectricity and electronic
ratchet effect. Yet, the understanding of the BLG/hBN MS electronic properties
has, at present, remained fairly limited. Here we develop a multi-messenger
approach that combines standard magnetotransport techniques with low-energy
sub-THz excitation to get insights into the properties of this MS. We show that
BLG/hBN lattice alignment results in the emergence of compensated semimetals at
some integer fillings of the moire bands separated by van Hove singularities
where Lifshitz transition occurs. A particularly pronounced semimetal develops
when 8 electrons reside in the moire unit cell, where coexisting high-mobility
electron and hole systems feature a strong magnetoresistance reaching 2350 %
already at B=0.25 T. Next, by measuring the THz-driven Nernst effect in remote
bands, we observe valley splitting, pointing to an orbital magnetization

photoresistance measurements, we show that the high-temperature conductivity of
the BLG/hBN MS is limited by electron-electron umklapp processes. Our

<i>Si-Da Xue, Qi-Jun Hong</i>
<p>Predicting material properties has always been a challenging task in
materials science. With the emergence of machine learning methodologies, new
avenues have opened up. In this study, we build upon our recently developed
Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to construct models that predict four
distinct material properties. Our graph model represents materials as element
graphs, with chemical formula serving as the only input. This approach ensures
permutation invariance, offering a robust solution to prior limitations. By
employing bootstrap methods to train on this individual GNN, we further enhance
the reliability and accuracy of our predictions. With multi-task learning, we
harness the power of extensive datasets to boost the performance of smaller
ones. We introduce the inaugural version of the Materials Properties Prediction
(MAPP) framework, empowering the prediction of material properties solely based
on chemical formulas.

<h3>Unusual quasiparticles and tunneling conductance in quantum point  contacts in $ν=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05142" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05142</a>
<br>
<i>Vadim Ponomarenko, Yuli Lyanda-Geller</i>
<p>Understanding topological matter in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect
requires identifying the nature of edge state quasiparticles. FQH edge state at
the filling factor $\nu=2/3$ in the spin-polarized and non-polarized phases is
represented by the two modes of composite fermions (CF) with the parallel or
opposite spins described by the chiral Luttinger liquids. Tunneling through a
quantum point contact (QPC) in such systems between different or similar spin
phases is solved exactly. With the increase of the applied voltage, the QPC
conductance grows from zero and saturates at $e^2/2h$ while a weak electron
tunneling between the edge modes with the same spin transforms into a
backscattering carried by the charge $q=e/2$ quasiparticles. These unusual
quasiparticles and conductance plateau emerge in the QPC with one or two CF
modes scattering into a single mode, as occurs in these systems. We propose
experiments on the applied voltage and temperature dependence of the QPC
conductance and noise that can shed light on the nature of edge states and FQH
transport.

<h3>Scattering description of edge states in Aharonov-Bohm triangle chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05153" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05153</a>
<br>
<i>Zhi-Hai Liu, O. Entin-Wohlman, A. Aharony, J. Q. You, H. Q. Xu</i>
<p>Scattering theory has been suggested as a convenient method to identify
topological phases of matter, in particular of disordered systems for which the
Bloch band-theory approach is inapplicable. Here we examine this idea,
employing as a benchmark a one-dimensional triangle chain whose versatility
yields a scattering matrix that ``flows" in parameter space among several
members of the topology classification scheme. Our results show that the
reflection amplitudes (from both ends of a sufficiently long chain) do indicate
the appearance of edge states in {\it all} (topological and non-topological)
cases. For the topological cases, the transmission has a peak at the
topological phase transition, which happens at the Fermi energy. A peak still
exists as one moves into the non-topological `trivial' regions, in which
another transmission peak may occur at nonzero energy, at which a relevant edge
state appears in the isolated chain. For finite chains, the peak in the
transmission strongly depends on their coupling of the leads, and {\it not} on
the phase transition of the isolated chain. In any case, {\it the appearance of
a peak in the transmission is not sufficient to conclude that the system
undergoes a topological phase transition.}

<h3>The Ground State Lattice Distortion of CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ Revealed by de  Haas-van Alphen Oscillations</h3>

<i>Senyang Pan, Feng Du, Yong Zhang, Zheng Chen, Qi Li, Yingcai Qian, Xiangde Zhu, Chuanying Xi, Li Pi, Wing Chi Yu, Qun Niu, Jinglei Zhang, Mingliang Tian</i>
<p>The recently discovered AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have
garnered intense attention in the scientific community due to their unique
characteristics as kagome superconductors coexisting with a charge density wave
(CDW) order. To comprehend the electronic properties of this system, it is
essential to understand the lattice distortions associated with the CDW order
and the ground state electronic behavior. Here, we comprehensively examine the
Fermi surface by a combination of angle-dependent torque magnetometry and
density functional theory calculations. We observe magnetic breakdown in the de
Haas-van Alphen oscillations under high magnetic fields. Additionally, by
examining the angular and temperature variations in quantum oscillation
frequencies, we gain insight into the evolution of the three-dimensional like
Fermi surfaces and the cyclotron masses of the orbits, which are consistent
with weak electron-phonon coupling. Notably, further comparisons indicate that
the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Star-of-David (SoD) distortion is more compatible with
both high frequency data above 1000\,T and low frequency data below 500\,T,
while the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Tri-Hexagonal (TrH) distortion aligns well with
experimental data at mid frequencies. This finding implies the inherent
coexistence of both TrH and SoD 2$\times$2$\times$2 patterns within the CDW
order. These observations provide key insights into the interplay among
effective electronic dimensionality, CDW state, and superconductivity.

<h3>The impact of polymer rheology on the extrusion flow in fused filament  fabrication</h3>

<br>
<i>Tomás Schuller, Paola Fanzio, Franciso J. Galindo-Rosales</i>
<p>Polymer rheology is the study of the flow and deformation of polymer
materials. It is paramount in designing material extrusion applications, such
as fused filament fabrication (FFF), as polymer rheology affects the fluid-flow
characteristics of the polymer melt inside the nozzle. This work analyses the
molten flow patterns inside the printing nozzle in fused filament fabrication
process, generated by a range of polymer melts and modelled through a
viscoelastic model (Giesekus) based on rheological properties experimentally
determined under viscometric flows. The normal stress surface plots show that
the distribution of these stresses around the contraction is related to the
fluid rheology and partially responsible for the pressure drop differences and
instabilities. The elasticity of the molten polymer flowing through small
length scales leads to elastic instabilities and eventually to elastic
turbulence at actual printing speeds. This phenomenon increases excess pressure
drop and, possibly, leads to failures during the printing process.

<br>
<i>Kexin Zhang, Hugo V. Lepage, Ying Dong, Crispin H. W. Barnes</i>
<p>We study how to use the surface states in a Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ topological
insulator ultra-thin film that are affected by finite size effects for the
purpose of quantum computing. We demonstrate that: (i) surface states under the
finite size effect can effectively form a two-level system where their energy
levels lie in between the bulk energy gap and a logic qubit can be constructed,
(ii) the qubit can be initialized and manipulated using electric pulses of
simple forms, (iii) two-qubit entanglement is achieved through a
$\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ operation when the two qubits are in a parallel setup, and
(iv) alternatively, a Floquet state can be exploited to construct a qubit and
two Floquet qubits can be entangled through a Controlled-NOT operation. The
Floquet qubit offers robustness to background noise since there is always an
oscillating electric field applied, and the single qubit operations are
controlled by amplitude modulation of the oscillating field, which is
convenient experimentally.

<h3>Impact of Ligand Substitution and Metal Node Exchange in the Electronic  Properties of Scandium Terephthalate Frameworks</h3>

<br>
<i>Holger-Dietrich Saßnick, Fabiana Machado Ferreira De Araujo, Joshua Edzards, Caterina Cocchi</i>
<p>The search for sustainable alternatives to established materials is a
sensitive topic in materials science. Due to their unique structural and
physical characteristics, the composition of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
can be tuned by the exchange of the metal nodes and the functionalization of
the organic ligands giving rise to a large configurational space. Considering
the case of scandium terephthalate MOFs and adopting an automatized
computational framework based on density-functional theory, we explore the
impact of metal substitution with the earth-abundant isoelectronic elements Al
and Y, and of ligand functionalization of varying electronegativity. We find
that structural properties are strongly impacted by the metal ion substitution
and only moderately by ligand functionalization. In contrast, the energetic
stability, the charge density distribution, and the electronic properties -
including the size of the band gap - are primarily affected by the termination
of the linker molecules. Functional groups such as OH and NH$_2$ lead to
particularly stable structures thanks to the formation of hydrogen bonds and
affect the electronic structure of the MOFs by introducing mid-gap states.

<h3>Domain-wall skyrmion chain and domain-wall bimerons in chiral magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuki Amari, Calum Ross, Muneto Nitta</i>
<p>We construct domain-wall skyrmion chains and domain-wall bimerons in chiral
magnets with an out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy and without a Zeeman term
coupling to a magnetic field. Domain-wall skyrmions are skyrmions trapped
inside a domain wall, they are present in the ferromagnetic (FM) phase of a
chiral magnet with an out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy. In this paper, we
explore the stability of domain-wall skyrmions in the FM phase and in a chiral
soliton lattice (CSL) or spiral phase, which is a periodic array of domain
walls and anti-domain walls arranged in an alternating manner. In the FM phase,
the worldline of a domain-wall skyrmion is bent to form a cusp at the position
of the skyrmion. We describe such a cusp using both an analytic method and
numerical solutions, and find a good agreement between them for small DM
interactions. We show that the cusp grows toward the phase boundary with the
CSL, and eventually diverges at the boundary. Second, if we put one skyrmion
trapped inside a domain wall in a CSL, it decays into a pair of merons by a
reconnection of the domain wall and its adjacent anti-domain wall. Third, if we
put skyrmions and anti-skyrmions alternately in domain walls and anti-domain
walls, respectively such a chain is stable.

<p>Nabokoite family compounds ACu$_7$(TeO$_4$)(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl (A=Na, K, Cs, Rb)
are one of the candidates for the evasive spin-liquid state predicted for
highly-frustrated square kagome lattice (SKL). Their magnetic subsystem
includes SKL layers decorated by additional copper ions. All members of this
family are characterized by quite high Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim
80-200$~K), but magnetic ordering was reported only for Na and K compounds at
at a much lower temperatures below 4~K. We report here results of the study of
high-frequency ($\sim 10$~GHz) dielectric properties of this family of
compounds. Our study revealed presence of the strong dielectric anomaly both in
the real and imaginary parts of high-frequency dielectric permittivity for Na
and K compounds approx. 100 and 26~K, correspondingly, presumably related to
antiferroelectric ordering. Additionally, much weaker anomalies were observed
at approx. 5~K indicating possible interplay of magnetic and lattice degrees of
freedom. We discuss possible relation between the structure rearrangements
accompanying dielectric anomalies and a delayed magnetic ordering in the
nabokoite family compounds.

<h3>Heteroepitaxial growth of anatase (0 0 1) films on SrTiO3 (0 0 1) by PLD  and MBE</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Crespo, J. Gallenberger, Maurizio de Santis, V. Langlais, F. Carla, J.M. Caicedo, J. Rius, X. Torrelles</i>
<p>The epitaxial growth of anatase (001) films deposited by pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on SrTiO3 (001) (STO) single
crystals has been studied using X-ray diffraction and surface sensitivity UHV
techniques. The evolution of the strain represented by the microstrain and the
change of the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters with film growth
temperature, the effect of the annealing temperature and the influence of the
oxygen content of the film have been investigated.The out-of-plane lattice
strain shows a compressive (-0.2%) or expansive (+0.3%) behavior, in the range
600-900$^\circ$C, for temperatures below or above 700$^\circ$C, respectively.
The in-plane lattice parameters, as well as the cell volume of the film, remain
under compression over the entire temperature range explored.PLD films grow
into square islands that align with the surface lattice directions of the STO
substrate. The maximum size of these islands is reached at growth temperatures
close to 875-925$^\circ$C. Film annealing at temperatures of 800$^\circ$C or
higher melts the islands into flat terraces. Larger terraces are reached at
high annealing temperatures of 925$^\circ$C for extended periods of 12 hours.
This procedure allows flat surface terrace sizes of up to 650 nm to be
achieved.The crystalline quality achieved in anatase films prepared by PLD or
MBE growth methods is similar. The two-step anatase growth process used during
the synthesis of the films with both methods: film growth and post-annealing
treatment in oxygen or air at ambient pressure, using temperature and time as
key parameters, allows to control the surface terrace size and stoichiometry of
the films, as well as the anatase/rutile intermixing rates at sufficiently high
temperatures. This growth process could allow the substitution of their
equivalent single crystals. The range of applicability of these films would
include their use as structural and electronic model systems, or in harsh
experimental conditions due to their low production cost.

<h3>Exciton Spin Hall Effect In Arc-Shaped Strained WSe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Shubnic, V. Shahnazaryan, I. A. Shelykh, H. Rostami</i>
<p>Generating a pure spin current using electrons, which have degrees of freedom
beyond spin, such as electric charge and valley index, presents challenges. In
response, we propose a novel mechanism based on intervalley exciton dynamics in
{\em arc-shaped} strained transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to achieve
the {\em exciton spin Hall effect} in an electrically insulating regime,
without the need for an external electric field. The interplay between strain
gradients and strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields results in a net Lorentz
force on long-lived intervalley excitons in WSe$_2$, carrying non-zero spin
angular momentum. This process generates an exciton-mediated pure spin Hall
current, resulting in opposite-sign spin accumulations and local magnetization
on the two sides of the single-layer arc-shaped TMD. We demonstrate that the
magnetic field induced by spin accumulation, at approximately $\sim {\rm mT}$,
can be detected using techniques such as superconducting quantum interference
magnetometry or spatially-resolved magneto-optical Faraday and Kerr rotations.

<h3>Squeezing Bose-Bose liquid drops</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Sanuy, R. Barač, P. Stipanović, L. Vranješ Markić, J. Boronat</i>
<p>We explore ultradilute Bose-Bose liquid droplets squeezed by an external
harmonic potential in one spatial direction. Our theoretical study is based on
a functional that is built using quantum Monte Carlo results of the bulk phase
and incorporates finite-range effects. A characteristic feature of these drops
is the existence of a critical atom number, that is the minimum number of
particles to have a many-body bound state. We report results on the critical
atom numbers for different magnetic fields and applying confinement strengths
towards a quasi-two-dimensional setup. In the regime where the local density
approximation is expected to be valid, we find that the critical atom number
decreases linearly with the harmonic oscillator length of the confining
potential. With the largest squeezing explored in our work, we predict stable
drops at the level of one thousand atoms. Our functional reduces the critical
numbers for any confinement and applied magnetic field with respect to the
estimations based on the Lee-Huang-Yang model. We observe saturated drops when
the number of atoms in the drop is much larger than the critical value, their
central density being higher for the quantum Monte Carlo functional than for
the Lee-Huang-Yang one.

<i>Hiroshi Noguchi, Frédéric van Wijland, Jean-Baptiste Fournier</i>
<p>We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three-state Potts model
using simulations and theory. At low cycling energy, the homogeneous dominant
state cycles via nucleation and growth, while spiral waves are formed at high
energy. For large systems, a discontinuous transition occurs from these cyclic
homogeneous phases to spiral waves, while the opposite transition is absent.
Conversely, these two modes can coexist for small systems. The waves can be
reproduced by a continuum theory, and the transition can be understood from the
competition between nucleation and growth.

<h3>Magnon-phonon coupling of synthetic antiferromagnets in a surface  acoustic wave cavity resonator</h3>

<br>
<i>Hiroki Matsumoto, Isamu Yasuda, Motoki Asano, Takuya Kawada, Masashi Kawaguchi, Daiki Hatanaka, Masamitsu Hayashi</i>
<p>We use a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity resonator to study the coupling
of acoustic magnons in a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) and the phonons
carried by SAWs. The SAF is composed of a CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB trilayer and the
scattering matrix of the SAW resonator is studied to assess the coupling. We
find that the spectral linewidth of the SAW resonator is modulated when the
frequency of the excited magnons approaches the SAW resonance frequency.
Moreover, the linewidth modulation varies with the magnitude and orientation of
the external magnetic field. Such change in the spectral linewidth can be well
reproduced using macrospin-like model calculations. From the model analyses, we
estimate the magnon-phonon coupling strength to be $\sim$15.6 MHz at a SAW
resonance frequency of 1.8 GHz: the corresponding magnomechanical cooperativity
is $\sim$0.66. As the spectral shape hardly changes in a CoFeB single layer
reference sample under the same experimental condition, these results show that
SAF provides an ideal platform to study magnon-phonon coupling in a SAW cavity
resonator.

<i>Sawani Datta, Khadiza Ali, Rahul Verma, Bahadur Singh, Saroj P. Dash, A. Thamizhavel, Kalobaran Maiti</i>
<p>We study the behavior of Dirac fermions in the presence of electron
correlation in a nonsymmorphic Kondo lattice system, CeAgSb2 employing
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles
calculations. Experiments reveal crossings of highly dispersive linear bands at
the Brillouin zone boundary due to non-symmorphic symmetry. In addition,
anisotropic Dirac cones are observed constituted by the squarenet Sb 5p states
forming a diamond-shaped nodal line. The Dirac bands are linear in a wide
energy range with a unusually high slope and exhibit distinct Dirac point in
this highly spin-orbit coupled system. Interestingly, the linearity of the
bands are preserved even after the hybridization of these states with the local
Ce 4f states, which leads to a small reduction of slope via formation of a
'kink'. These results seed the emergence of an area of robust topological
fermions even in presence of strong correlation.

<h3>Native point defects in HgCdTe infrared detector material: Identifying  nonradiative recombination centers from first principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05283</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Chen, Gian-Marco Rignanese, Jifeng Liu, Geoffroy Hautier</i>
<p>We investigate the native point defects in the long-wavelength infrared
(LWIR) detector material Hg$_{0.25}$Cd$_{0.25}$Te using a dielectric-dependent
hybrid density functional combined with spin-orbit coupling. Characterizing
these point defects is essential to as they are responsible for intrinsic
doping and nonradiative recombination centers in the detector material. The
dielectric-dependent hybrid functional allows for an accurate description of
the band gap ($E_g$) for Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Te (MCT) over the entire
compositional range, a level of accuracy challenging with standard hybrid
functionals. Our comprehensive examination of the native point defects confirms
that the two isoelectronic cation vacancies ($V_\text{Hg}$ and $V_\text{Cd}$)
are the primary sources of $p$-type conductivity in the LWIR material given
their low defect formation energies and the presence of a shallow acceptor
level $(-/0)$ near the valence-band maximum (VBM). In addition to the shallow
acceptor level, the cation vacancies exhibit a deep charge transition level
$(2-/-)$ situated at $E_g/2$ above the VBM, which is characteristic of
nonradiative recombination centers. While other point defects generally do not
exhibit deep levels, our results indicate that two donor interstitials,
specifically the Te and the Hg interstitials, could potentially account for the
deep centers in the LWIR MCT.

<i>S. J. Sreerag, N. Malathi, Shahla Yasmin Mathengattil, Rabindranath Bag, Surjeet Singh, Rajeev N. Kini</i>
<p>We demonstrate dynamic control of the lattice by THz light by exploiting the
coupling of phonon modes. The low-energy sliding phonon modes in the
spin-ladder system, Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$, are excited using THz radiation
with high electric fields. Due to the nonlinearities induced by the THz
electric fields, the low-energy phonon mode couples to the higher energy,
silent optical phonon modes at $\approx$ 1.17 THz. This indirect excitation of
the silent phonon mode is reflected as an enhancement of the THz transmission
near 1.17 THz. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to indirectly
control inaccessible phonon modes with THz frequency electromagnetic radiation,
which provides opportunities to alter such material systems' electronic and
magnetic properties dynamically using THz radiation.

<p>Converting angular momentum between different degrees of freedom within a
magnetic material results from a dynamic interplay between electrons, magnons
and phonons. This interplay is pivotal to implementing spintronic device
concepts that rely on spin angular momentum transport. We establish a new
concept for long-range angular momentum transport that further allows to
address and isolate the magnonic contribution to angular momentum transport in
a nanostructured metallic ferromagnet. To this end, we electrically excite and
detect spin transport between two parallel and electrically insulated
ferromagnetic metal strips on top of a diamagnetic substrate. Charge-to-spin
current conversion within the ferromagnetic strip generates electronic spin
angular momentum that is transferred to magnons via electron-magnon coupling.
We observe a finite angular momentum flow to the second ferromagnetic strip
across a diamagnetic substrate over micron distances, which is electrically
detected in the second strip by the inverse charge-to-spin current conversion
process. We discuss phononic and dipolar interactions as the likely cause to
transfer angular momentum between the two strips. Moreover, our work provides
the experimental basis to separate the electronic and magnonic spin transport
and thereby paves the way towards magnonic device concepts that do not rely on
magnetic insulators.

<i>Shintaro Hoshino</i>
<p>Relativistic correction to the Coulomb interaction is considered for strongly
correlated electron orbitals. The atomic representation of the Coulomb-Breit
interaction and its physical origin are clarified, to generalize a concept of
the Slater-Condon parameters. In the derivation, it proves advantageous to
employ the spherical representation of photons, which can be categorized into
three types: scalar, electric, and magnetic photons. The electronic degrees of
freedom can similarly be classified in terms of the angular momentum tensor or
multipoles. Consequently, the interaction between electric multipoles is
mediated by scalar photons, magnetic multipoles by magnetic photons, and
magnetic toroidal multipoles by electric photons. These parameters can be
integrated with the multiorbital Hubbard model or the Anderson lattice and
serve as the foundational framework for investigating relativistic strongly
correlated electron systems.

<p>Controlling excitons at the nanoscale in semiconductor materials represents a
formidable challenge in the fields of quantum photonics and optoelectronics.
Achieving this control holds great potential for unlocking strong
exciton-exciton interaction regimes, enabling exciton-based logic operations,
exploring exotic quantum phases of matter, facilitating deterministic
positioning and tuning of quantum emitters, and designing advanced
optoelectronic devices. Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
offer inherent two-dimensional confinement and possess significant binding
energies, making them particularly promising candidates for achieving
electric-field-based confinement of excitons without dissociation. While
previous exciton engineering strategies have predominantly focused on local
strain gradients, the recent emergence of electrically confined states in TMDs
has paved the way for novel approaches. Exploiting the valley degree of freedom
associated with these confined states further broadens the prospects for
exciton engineering. Here, we show electric control of light polarization
emitted from one-dimensional (1D) quantum confined states in MoSe2. By
employing non-uniform in-plane electric fields, we demonstrate the in-situ
tuning of the trapping potential and reveal how gate-tunable
valley-hybridization gives rise to linearly polarized emission from these
localized states. Remarkably, the polarization of the localized states can be
entirely engineered through either the spatial geometry of the 1D confinement
potential or the application of an out-of-plane magnetic field.

<p>The ability to manipulate rheological and electrical properties of colloidal

such as batteries and fuel cells, where they conduct electricity and prevent
sedimentation of `granular' active components. While it is commonly assumed
that granular fillers have a simple additive effect on the composite
properties, new phenomena can emerge unexpectedly, with some composites
exhibiting a unique rheological bi-stability between solid-like and liquid-like
states. Here we report such bi-stability in suspensions of non-Brownian
graphite and colloidal carbon black in oil, a model system to mimic composite
suspensions for energy applications. Steady shear below a critical stress
elicits a transition to a persistent mechanically weak and poorly conducting
state, which must be `rejuvenated' using high-stress shear to recover a
stronger, high-conductivity state. Our findings highlight the highly tunable
nature of binary granular/gel composite suspensions, and present new
possibilities for optimizing mixing and processing conditions for Li-ion
battery slurries.

<h3>Liquid phase fast electron tomography unravels the true 3D structure of  colloidal assemblies</h3>

<i>Daniel Arenas Esteban, Da Wang, Ajinkya Kadu, Noa Olluyn, Ana Sánchez Iglesias, Alejandro Gomez Perez, Jesus Gonzalez Casablanca, Stavros Nicolopoulos, Luis M. Liz-Marzán, Sara Bals</i>
<p>Electron tomography has become a commonly used tool to investigate the
three-dimensional (3D) structure of nanomaterials, including colloidal
nanoparticle assemblies. However, the nature of the electron microscopy
technique typically requires such characterization to be carried out under high
vacuum. Therefore, pre-treatment sample preparation is needed for assemblies
prepared by (wet) colloid chemistry methods, including solvent evaporation and
deposition on a solid substrate (TEM grid). As a result, changes are
consistently imposed on the actual nanoparticle organization, which is largely
responsible for the nanomaterial properties. Therefore, we propose herein the
application of (fast) electron tomography of nanoparticle assemblies while in
their original colloidal environment. To address the challenges related to
electron tomography in liquid, we devised a method that combines fast data
acquisition in a commercial liquid in situ TEM cell with a dedicated
reconstruction workflow. We present the application of this method to two
different systems, which exemplify the effects of drying and vacuum, depending
on the nature of the protecting ligands. 3D reconstructions of assemblies
comprising polystyrene-capped Au nanoparticles encapsulated in polymeric shells
revealed less compact and more distorted configurations for experiments
performed in a liquid medium compared to their dried counterparts. On the other
hand, quantitative analysis of the interparticle distance of self-assembled Au
nanorods in water agrees with the previously reported dimensions of the ligand
layers surrounding the nanorods, whereas the nanorods are in much closer
contact in similar dried assemblies. This study, therefore, emphasizes the
importance of developing high-resolution characterization tools that preserve
the native environment of colloidal nanostructures.

<h3>Bose-Einstein condensation in systems with flux equilibrium</h3>

<br>
<i>Victor S. L'vov, Anna Pomyalov, Sergey V. Nazarenko, Dmytro A. Bozhko, Alexander J. E. Kreil, Burkard Hillebrands, Alexander A. Serga</i>
<p>We consider flux equilibrium in dissipative nonlinear wave systems subject to
external energy pumping. In such systems, the elementary excitations, or
quasiparticles, can create a Bose-Einstein condensate. We develop a theory on
the Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles for various regimes of
external excitation, ranging from weak and stationary to ultra-strong pumping,
enabling us to determine the number of quasiparticles near the bottom of the
energy spectrum and their distribution along wave vectors. We identify physical
phenomena leading to condensation in each of the regimes. For weak stationary
pumping, where the distribution of quasiparticles deviates only slightly from
thermodynamic equilibrium, we define a range of pumping parameters where the
condensation occurs and estimate the density of the condensate and the fraction
of the condensed quasiparticles. As the pumping amplitude increases, a powerful
influx of injected quasiparticles is created by the Kolmogorov-Zakharov
scattering cascade, leading to their Bose-Einstein condensation. With even
stronger pumping, kinetic instability may occur, resulting in a direct transfer
of injected quasiparticles to the bottom of the spectrum. For the case of
ultra-strong parametric pumping, we have developed a stationary nonlinear
theory of kinetic instability. The theory agrees qualitatively with
experimental data obtained using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy during
parametric pumping of magnons in room-temperature films of yttrium-iron garnet.

<h3>A single-photon emitter coupled to a phononic-crystal resonator in the  resolved-sideband regime</h3>

<i>Clemens Spinnler, Giang N. Nguyen, Ying Wang, Liang Zhai, Alisa Javadi, Marcel Erbe, Sven Scholz, Andreas D. Wieck, Arne Ludwig, Peter Lodahl, Leonardo Midolo, Richard J. Warburton</i>
<p>A promising route towards the heralded creation and annihilation of
single-phonons is to couple a single-photon emitter to a mechanical resonator.
The challenge lies in reaching the resolved-sideband regime with a large
coupling rate and a high mechanical quality factor. We achieve all of this by
coupling self-assembled InAs quantum dots to a small-mode-volume
phononic-crystal resonator with mechanical frequency $\Omega_\mathrm{m}/2\pi =
1.466~\mathrm{GHz}$ and quality factor $Q_\mathrm{m} = 2.1\times10^3$. Thanks
to the high coupling rate of $g_\mathrm{ep}/2\pi = 2.9~\mathrm{MHz}$, and by
exploiting a matching condition between the effective Rabi and mechanical
frequencies, we are able to observe the interaction between the two systems.
Our results represent a major step towards quantum control of the mechanical
resonator via a single-photon emitter.

<i>Clemens Spinnler, Giang N. Nguyen, Ying Wang, Marcel Erbe, Alisa Javadi, Liang Zhai, Sven Scholz, Andreas D. Wieck, Arne Ludwig, Peter Lodahl, Leonardo Midolo, Richard J. Warburton</i>
<p>We present experiments in which self-assembled InAs quantum dots are coupled
to a thin, suspended-beam GaAs resonator. The quantum dots are driven
resonantly and the resonance fluorescence is detected. The narrow quantum-dot
linewidths, just a factor of three larger than the transform limit, result in a
high sensitivity to the mechanical motion. We show that one quantum dot couples
to eight mechanical modes spanning a frequency range from $30$ to
$600~\mathrm{MHz}$: one quantum dot provides an extensive characterisation of
the mechanical resonator. The coupling spans the unresolved-sideband to the
resolved-sideband regimes. Finally, we present the first detection of
thermally-driven phonon sidebands (at $4.2~\mathrm{K}$) in the
resonance-fluoresence spectrum.

<p>Self-assembly of organic molecules represents a fascinating playground to
create various liquid crystalline (LC) nanostructures. In this work, we study
layer undulations on micrometer scale in smectic A phases for achiral
compounds, experimentally demonstrated as regular stripe patterns induced by
thermal treatment. Undulations including their anharmonic properties are
evaluated by means of polarimetric imaging and light diffraction experiments in
cells with various thicknesses. The key role in stripe formation is played by
high negative values of the thermal expansion coefficient.

<h3>Non-Gaussian displacements in active transport on a carpet of motile  cells</h3>

<br>
<i>Robert Großmann, Lara S. Bort, Ted Moldenhawer, Setareh Sharifi Panah, Ralf Metzler, Carsten Beta</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of micron-sized particles on a layer of motile cells.
This cell carpet acts as an active bath that propels passive tracer particles
via direct mechanical contact. The resulting nonequilibrium transport shows a
crossover from superdiffusive to normal-diffusive dynamics. The particle
displacement distribution is distinctly non-Gaussian even in the limit of long
measurement times -- different from typically reported Fickian yet non-Gaussian
transport, for which Gaussianity is restored beyond some system-specific
correlation time. We obtain the distribution of diffusion coefficients from the
experimental data and introduce a model for the displacement distribution that
matches the experimentally observed non-Gaussian statistics and argue why
similar transport properties are expected for many composite active matter
systems.

<h3>Large deviations and phase transitions in spectral linear statistics of  Gaussian random matrices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05384</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Valov, Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov</i>
<p>We evaluate, in the large-$N$ limit, the complete probability distribution
$\mathcal{P}(A,m)$ of the values $A$ of the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{N} |\lambda_i|^m$,
where $\lambda_i$ ($i=1,2,\dots, N$) are the eigenvalues of a Gaussian random
matrix, and $m$ is a positive real number. Combining the Coulomb gas method
with numerical simulations using a matrix variant of the Wang-Landau algorithm,
we found that, in the limit of $N\to \infty$, the rate function of
$\mathcal{P}(A,m)$ exhibits phase transitions of different characters. The
phase diagram of the system on the $(A,m)$ plane is surprisingly rich, as it
includes three regions: (i) a region with a single-interval support of the
optimal spectrum of eigenvalues, (ii) a region emerging for $m<2$ where the
optimal spectrum splits into two separate intervals, and (iii) a region
emerging for $m>2$ where the maximum or minimum eigenvalue ``evaporates" from
the rest of eigenvalues and dominates the statistics of $A$. The phase
transition between regions (i) and (iii) is of second order. Analytical
arguments and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the phase transition
between regions (i) and (ii) is of (in general) fractional order $p=1+1/|m-1|$,
where $0<m<2$. The transition becomes of infinite order in the special case of
$m=1$, where we provide a more complete analytical and numerical description.
Remarkably, the transition between regions (i) and (ii) for $m\leq 1$ and the
transition between regions (i) and (iii) for $m>2$ occur at the ground state of
the Coulomb gas which corresponds to the Wigner's semicircular distribution.

<h3>Spontaneous pattern formation in monolayers of binary mixtures with  competing interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05386" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05386</a>
<br>
<i>O. Patsahan, A. Meyra, A. Ciach</i>
<p>A model for a monolayer of two types of particles spontaneously forming
ordered patterns is studied by a mesoscopic theory and by MC simulations. We
assume hard-cores of the same size for both components, short-range attraction
long-range repulsion between particles of the same species, and the
cross-interaction of opposite sign. The model is inspired by oppositely charged
hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles or macromolecules with preferential
solubility in different components of a solvent that is close to a miscibility
critical point. We determine the phase diagram in the chemical potentials and
in the concentration - density planes for a few fixed temperatures in the
mean-field one-shell approximation. We find that the presence of the second
component significantly enlarges the temperature range of stability of the
ordered phases. We obtain three stable phases with periodic concentration: the
lamellar L phase with alternating stripes of the two components for similar
chemical potentials, and a hexagonal arrangement of the clusters of the
minority component in the liquid of the majority component. The latter two
phases, however, are stable only at relatively high temperatures. At lower
temperatures, the L phase coexists with a disordered one-component fluid or
with very dilute gas with mixed components. At still lower temperatures, the
one-component phase coexisting with the L phase can be disordered or ordered,
depending on the chemical potentials. The theoretical results are confirmed by
MC simulations for selected thermodynamic states.

<h3>Non-Markovian and Collective Search Strategies</h3>

<br>
<i>Hugues Meyer, Heiko Rieger</i>
<p>Agents searching for a target can improve their efficiency by memorizing
where they have already been searching or by cooperating with other searchers
and using strategies that benefit from collective effects. This chapter reviews
such concepts: non-Markovian and collective search strategies. We start with
the first passage properties of continuous non-Markovian processes and then
proceed to the discrete random walker with 1-step and n-step memory. Next we
discuss the auto-chemotactic walker, a random walker that produces a diffusive
chemotactic cue from which the walker tries to avoid. Then ensembles of agents
searching for a single target are discussed, whence the search efficiency may
comprise in addition to the first passage time also metabolic costs. We
consider the first passage properties of ensembles of chemotactic random
walkers and then the pursuit problem, in which searchers (or hunters /
predators) see the mobile target over a certain distance. Evasion strategies of
single or many targets are also elucidated. Finally we review collective
foraging strategies comprising many searchers and many immobile targets. We
finish with an outlook on future research directions comprising yet unexplored
search strategies of immune cells and in swarm robotics.

<h3>Parametrization of the Charge-Carrier Mobility in Organic Disordered  Semiconductors. APAE against EGDM</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05406</a>
<br>
<i>S. D. Baranovskii, A. V. Nenashev, D. Hertel, K. Meerholz, F. Gebhard</i>
<p>An appropriately parameterized compact analytical equation (APAE) is
suggested to account for charge carrier mobility in organic disordered
semiconductors (ODSs). This equation correctly reproduces the effects of
temperature $T$, carrier concentration $n$, and electric field $F$ on the
carrier mobility $\mu(T,F,n)$, as evidenced by comparison with analytical
theories and Monte Carlo simulations. The set of material parameters
responsible for charge transport is proven to be at varience to those used in
the so-called extended Gaussian disorder model (EGDM) approach, which is widely
exploited in commercially distributed device--simulation algorithms. While EGDM
is only valid for cubic lattices with a specific choice of parameters, APAE
describes charge transport in systems with spatial disorder in a wide range of
parameters. APAE is user-friendly and, thus, suitable for incorporation into
device-simulation algorithms.

<h3>Strain fluctuations unlock ferroelectricity in wurtzites</h3>

<br>

<p>Ferroelectric materials are of practical interest for non-volatile data
storage due to their reorientable, crystallographically defined polarization
states, yet efforts to integrate perovskite-based materials into ultrathin
non-volatile memories have been frustrated by film-thickness scaling
constraints, which limit ferroelectric switching under low voltage. Wurtzite
materials, including magnesium-substituted zinc oxide [(Zn,Mg)O], have recently
been shown to exhibit scalable ferroelectricity as thin films. While accurate
first-principles calculations predict that a biaxial tension of a few percent
may promote ferroelectricity in wurtzites, biaxial strains are found not to
exceed 0.3% in (Zn,Mg)O thin films at the solubility limit of Mg in ZnO. In
this work, this major discrepancy is resolved and the observations of
ferroelectricity in (Zn,Mg)O are explained by examining the influence of Mg
substitution on interatomic bonding and ferroelectric switching. Large strain
fluctuations emerge locally around individual Zn and Mg cations in (Zn,Mg)O,
causing a reduction of up to 45% in the local coercive fields via a sequential
mechanism of polarization reversal. This work provides direct quantitative
evidence that strain fluctuations can mediate polarization reversal in
wurtzites, opening up an avenue to develop scalable ferroelectric materials for
ultrathin microelectronics.

<p>The strongly attractive Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover is efficiently
described in terms of coupled fermions and fermion pairs, or molecules. We
compute the spectral functions of both fermions and pairs in the normal state
near the superfluid transition using a Keldysh formulation in real frequency.
The mutual influence between fermions and pairs is captured by solving the
self-consistent Luttinger-Ward equations: these include both the damping of
fermions by scattering off dressed pairs, as well as the decay of pair states
by dissociation into two dressed fermions. The pair spectra encode contact
correlations between fermions and form the basis for computing dynamical
response functions and transport properties.

<h3>Signature of superconductivity in pressurized La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>

<br>
<i>Qing Li, Ying-Jie Zhang, Zhe-Ning Xiang, Yuhang Zhang, Xiyu Zhu, Hai-Hu Wen</i>
<p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity near 80 K in bilayer
nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressures has renewed the exploration of
superconducting nickelate in bulk materials. The extension of superconductivity
in other nickelates in a broader family is also essential. Here, we report the
experimental observation of superconducting signature in trilayer nickelate
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressures. By using a modified sol-gel method
and post-annealing treatment under high oxygen pressure, we successfully
obtained polycrystalline La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ samples with different transport
behaviors at ambient pressure. Then we performed high-pressure electrical
resistance measurements on these samples in a diamond-anvil-cell (DAC)
apparatus. Surprisingly, the signature of possible superconducting transition
with a maximum transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) of about 20 K under high
pressures is observed, as evidenced by a clear drop of resistance and the
suppression of resistance drops under magnetic fields. Although the resistance
drop is sample-dependent and relatively small, it appears in all of our
measured samples. We argue that the observed superconducting signal is most
likely to originate from the main phase of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Our findings
will motivate the exploration of superconductivity in a broader family of
nickelates and shed light on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of
high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity in nickelates.

<p>The discovery of multiple superconducting phases in UTe2 boosted research on
correlated-electron physics. This heavy-fermion paramagnet was rapidly
identified as a reference compound to study the interplay between magnetism and
unconventional superconductivity with multiple degrees of freedom. The
proximity to a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition was initially proposed as
a driving force to triplet-pairing superconductivity. However, we find here
that long-range incommensurate antiferromagnetic order is established under
pressure. The propagation vector km = (0.07,0.33,1) of the antiferromagnetic
phase is close to a wavevector where antiferromagnetic fluctuations have
previously been observed at ambient pressure. These elements support that UTe2
is a nearly-antiferromagnet at ambient pressure. Our work appeals for theories
modelling the evolution of the magnetic interactions and electronic properties,
driving a correlated paramagnetic regime at ambient pressure to a long-range
antiferromagnetic order under pressure. A deeper understanding of
itinerant-f-electrons magnetism in UTe2 will be a key for describing its
unconventional superconducting phases.

<h3>An Exact Expression for Multidimensional Spectroscopy of a Spin-Boson  Hamiltonian</h3>

<i>Albert Liu</i>
<p>Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize
nonlinear optical response functions. Typically, multidimensional spectra are
interpreted via a perturbative framework that straightforwardly provides
intuition into the density matrix dynamics that give rise to specific spectral
features. When the goal is to characterize system coupling to a thermal bath
however, the perturbative formalism becomes unwieldy and yields less intuition.
Here, we extend an approach developed by Vagov et al. to provide an exact
expression for multidimensional spectra of a spin-boson Hamiltonian up to
arbitrary order of electric field interaction. We demonstrate the utility of
this expression by modeling polaron formation and coherent exciton-phonon
coupling in quantum dots, which strongly agree with experiment.

<p>Our studies of the cyclotron resonance (CR) photoresistance in GaAs-based
two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) reveal an anomalously low sensitivity
to the helicity of the incoming circularly polarized terahertz radiation. We
find that this anomaly is strongly intensity dependent, and the ratio of the
low-temperature photoresistance signals for the CR-active (CRA) and CR-inactive
(CRI) polarities of magnetic field increases with lowering power, but,
nevertheless, remains substantially lower than expected from conventional
theory assuming interaction of the plane electromagnetic wave with the uniform
2DES. Our analysis shows that all data can be well described by the nonlinear
CR-enhanced electron gas heating in both CRA and CRI regimes. This description,
however, requires a source of anomalous absorption of radiation in the CRI
regime. It can stem from evanescent electromagnetic fields originating from the
near-field diffraction within or in the vicinity of the quantum well hosting
the 2DES.

<p>Magnetic skyrmions exhibit unique, technologically relevant pseudo-particle
behaviors which arise from their topological protection, including
well-defined, three-dimensional dynamic modes that occur at microwave
frequencies. During dynamic excitation, spin waves are ejected into the
interstitial regions between skyrmions, creating the magnetic equivalent of a
turbulent sea. However, since the spin waves in these systems have a
well-defined length scale, and the skyrmions are on an ordered lattice, ordered
structures from spin wave interference can precipitate from the chaos. This
work uses small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to capture the dynamics in
hybrid skyrmions and investigate the spin wave structure. Performing
simultaneous ferromagnetic resonance and SANS, the diffraction pattern shows a
large increase in low-angle scattering intensity which is present only in the
resonance condition. This scattering pattern is best fit using a mass fractal
model, which suggests the spin waves form a long-range fractal network. The
fractal structure is constructed of fundamental units with a size that encodes
the spin wave emissions and are constrained by the skyrmion lattice. These
results offer critical insights into the nanoscale dynamics of skyrmions,
identify a new dynamic spin wave fractal structure, and demonstrates SANS as a
unique tool to probe high-speed dynamics.

<br>
<i>Yael Avni, Michel Fruchart, David Martin, Daniel Seara, Vincenzo Vitelli</i>
<p>Systems with non-reciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent
states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to
active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the
stability of these uniform non-reciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended
systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the criticality of the
corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address
these questions by introducing a non-reciprocal generalization of the Ising
model and study its critical behavior by means of numerical and analytical
approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous
phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale
numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed
in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets. The swap phase is
destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of
discrete spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where
non-reciprocity changes the universality class from Ising to XY giving rise to
robust spatially-distributed clocks.

<h3>Orbital-selective Superconductivity in the Pressurized Bilayer Nickelate  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: An Infinite Projected Entangled-Pair State Study</h3>

<br>
<i>Jialin Chen, Fan Yang, Wei Li</i>
<p>The newly discovered high-$T_c$ nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
has generated significant research interest. To understand the pairing
mechanism, the intriguing interplay between the two $e_g$ orbitals remains to
be explored. Here we perform an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS)
study of the bilayer $t$-$J$ model, directly in the thermodynamic limit and
with orbitally selective parameters for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$
electrons, respectively. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons exhibit significant
intralayer hopping $t_\parallel$ and spin couplings $J_\parallel$, with
interlayer $J_\perp$ passed from $d_{z^2}$ electrons, while the interlayer
$t_\perp$ is negligible. In contrast, the $d_{z^2}$ orbital demonstrates strong
interlayer $t_\perp$ and $J_\perp$, while the intralayer $t_\parallel$ and
$J_\parallel$ are very small. Based on the iPEPS results, we find clear
orbital-selective behaviors in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals
exhibit robust SC order driven by the interlayer coupling $J_\perp$; while the
$d_{z^2}$ band shows relatively weak SC order even if we artificially introduce
some $t_\parallel$ to it. Furthermore, by substituting rare-earth element Pm or
Sm with La, we have discovered an enhanced SC order, which opens up a promising
avenue for discovering bilayer nickelate superconductors with even higher
$T_c$.

<p>The parallel or antiparallel arrangement of electron spins plays a pivotal
role in determining the properties of a physical system. To meet the demands
for innovative technological solutions, extensive efforts have been dedicated
to exploring effective methods for controlling and manipulating this
arrangement [1]. Among various techniques, ultrashort laser pulses have emerged
as an exceptionally efficient tool to influence magnetic order. Ultrafast
suppression of the magnetic order [2,3], all-optical magnetization switching
[4, 5, 6, 7], and light-induced magnetic phase transitions [8] are just a few
notable examples. However, the transient nature of light-induced changes in the
magnetic state has been a significant limitation, hindering their practical
implementation. In this study, we demonstrate that infrared ultrashort laser
pulses can induce a ferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments in an
amorphous TbCo alloy, a material that exhibits ferrimagnetism under equilibrium
conditions. Strikingly, the observed changes in the magnetic properties persist
for significantly longer durations than any previously reported findings. Our
results reveal that ultrashort optical pulses can generate materials with
identical chemical composition and structural state but entirely distinct
magnetic arrangements, leading to unique magnetic properties. This breakthrough
discovery marks a new era in light-driven control of matter, offering the
exciting potential to create materials with properties that were once
considered unattainable.

<h3>Thermodynamic and Superstatistics Properties Using Parametric  Generalized Fractional Nikiforov-Uvarov Method</h3>

<i>M. Abu-Shady, Sh. Y. Ezz-Alarab</i>
<p>The generalized fractional derivative (GFD) of the parametric
Nikiforov-Uvarov method is employed. The energy eigenvalues and total
normalized wave function are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomial using
the proposed Coulomb plus screened exponential hyperbolic potential (CPSEHP).
The suggested potential works best with lower values of the screening
parameter. The consequent energy eigenvalue is provided in a simple format and
extended to investigate thermal properties and superstatistics that are
presented in the context of partition function Z and other thermodynamic
properties such as vibrational mean energy U, vibrational specific heat
capacity C, vibrational entropy S, and vibrational free energy F. The overall
pattern of the partition function and other thermodynamic properties one
determined for both thermal properties and superstatistics. Also, a comparison
with the previous literature is studied. The classical case is derived from the
fractional case at {\alpha}=\b{eta}=1. We conclude that the fractional
parameter has a critical role in thermal properties and superstatics in the
present model.

<p>We analyze the open dynamics of quantum systems conditioned on no jumps being
detected. We first obtain general results relating the no-jump probability and
the waiting-time distributions to the conditional evolution of specific system
observables. These results are applied to single-qubit models, whose
conditional dynamics is quite involved and shows a rich set of physical
behaviors. Furthermore, we obtain general expressions for the no-jump dynamics
of non-interacting fermionic-bosonic chains undergoing Gaussian-preserving
dynamics. We show that the conditional dynamics is determined by a non-linear
Riccati-type differential equation for the correlation matrix. Finally, we
apply our results to chains of hopping particles under inhomogeneous jump rates
and boundary driven systems in presence of pairing terms.

<h3>Investigating the cause of crossover from charge/spin stripe insulator  to correlated metallic phase in layered T' nickelates -- R$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05518" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05518</a>
<br>
<i>Dibyata Rout, Sanchayeta Ranajit Mudi, Suman Karmakar, Rajeev Rawat, Surjeet Singh</i>
<p>The $T^{\prime}$ infinite layered nickelates have recently garnered
significant attention owing to the discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped
RNiO$_2$ (R $=$ La, Pr, or Nd), which is the $n = \infty$ member of the series
R$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$. Here, we investigate the $n = 3$ member, namely
R$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ (R $=$ La, Pr, or Nd) of this family. The compound
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ exhibits simultaneous charge/spin-stripe ordering at
T$_N^\ast$ $=$ 105 K, which is also concomitant with the onset of
metal-to-insulator (MIT) transition upon lowering the temperature below
T$_N^\ast$. We investigate the conspicuous absence of this transition in the Pr
and Nd analogues of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$. To achieve this purpose, we synthesized
solid-solutions of the form (La, Pr)$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ and (La, Nd)$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$
and examined the behavior of T$_N^\ast$ as a function of the average R-site
ionic radius ($r_{\overline{R}}$). We show that after an initial quasilinear
decrease with decreasing $r_{\overline{R}}$, T$_N^\ast$ suddenly vanishes in
the narrow range 1.134 $\AA$ $\leq$ $r_{\overline{R}}$ $\leq$ 1.143 $\AA$. In
the same range, we observed the emergence of a new transition below T$^\ast$,
whose onset temperature increases as $r_{\overline{R}}$ further decreases. We,
therefore, argue that the sudden vanishing of charge/spin-stripe/MIT ordering
upon decreasing $r_{\overline{R}}$ is due to the appearance of a new competing
phase. The point $r_{\overline{R}}$ $\approx$ $r_c$, where T$_N^\ast$ vanishes
and T$^\ast$ appears -- a quantum critical point -- should be investigated
further. In this regard, Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ and Pr-rich samples should be useful
due to the weak magnetization response associated with the Pr-sublattice, as
shown here.

<h3>Stabilizing persistent currents in an atomtronic Josephson junction  necklace</h3>

<br>
<i>Luca Pezzè, Klejdja Xhani, Cyprien Daix, Nicola Grani, Beatrice Donelli, Francesco Scazza, Diego Hernandez-Rajkov, Woo Jin Kwon, Giulia Del Pace, Giacomo Roati</i>
<p>Arrays of Josephson junctions are at the forefront of research on quantum
circuitry for quantum computing, simulation and metrology. They provide a
testing bed for exploring a variety of fundamental physical effects where
macroscopic phase coherence, nonlinearities and dissipative mechanisms compete.
Here we realize finite-circulation states in an atomtronic Josephson junction
necklace, consisting of a tunable array of tunneling links in a ring-shaped
superfluid. We study the stability diagram of the atomic flow by tuning both
the circulation and the number of junctions. We predict theoretically and
demonstrate experimentally that the atomic circuit withstands higher
circulations (corresponding to higher critical currents) by increasing the
number of Josephson links. The increased stability contrasts with the trend of
the superfluid fraction -- quantified by Leggett's criterion -- which instead
decreases with the number of junctions and the corresponding density depletion.
Our results demonstrate atomic superfluids in mesoscopic structured ring
potentials as excellent candidates for atomtronics applications, with prospects
towards the observation of non-trivial macroscopic superpositions of current
states.

<h3>Incommensurate order with translationally invariant projected  entangled-pair states: Spiral states and quantum spin liquid on the  anisotropic triangular lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05534</a>
<br>
<i>Juraj Hasik, Philippe Corboz</i>
<p>Simulating strongly correlated systems with incommensurate order poses
significant challenges for traditional finite-size-based approaches. Confining
such a phase to a finite-size geometry can induce spurious frustration, with
spin spirals in frustrated magnets being a typical example. Here, we introduce
an ansatz based on infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) which
overcomes these limitations and enables the direct search for the optimal
spiral in the thermodynamic limit, with a computational cost that is
independent of the spiral's wavelength. Leveraging this method, we simulate the
Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice, which interpolates
between the square and isotropic triangular lattice limits. Besides accurately
reproducing the magnetically ordered phases with arbitrary wavelength, the
simulations reveal a quantum spin liquid phase emerging between the N\'eel and
spin spiral phases.

<h3>Strain-Hardening Stages and Structure Evolution in pure Niobium and  Vanadium upon high pressure torsion</h3>

<br>
<i>L.M. Voronova, T.I. Chashchukhina, E.F. Talantsev, M.V. Degtyarev, T.M. Gapontseva</i>
<p>High pressure torsion (HPT) is one of the ways to form nanostructured
materials with high strength properties. However, HPT hardening mechanisms vary
from material to material and are poorly understood for some BCC metals,
particularly niobium and vanadium. This work aims to identify strain hardening
stages for Nb and V metals during HPT. Two approaches have been used to
identify the deformation stages during high pressure torsion. The approaches
are based on the application of a "piecewise" model, taking into account the
different deformation mechanisms that determine the type of the forming
structure, and on the analysis of the hardness vs. true strain dependence
according to the $H$$-$${e}^{0.5}$ law. We compared the identified stages with
the results of the electron microscopic study of the structure. Both models
describe well the structural changes observed microscopically in HPT-deformed
niobium. However, we have shown that only the piecewise model gives an adequate
description of the stages of structure development in vanadium. We have
provided an explanation for the observed difference in the behavior of niobium
and vanadium upon HPT.

<h3>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene I:  Interaction-Driven Chern Bands and Fractional Quantum Hall States at Zero  Magnetic Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05568</a>
<br>
<i>Junkai Dong, Taige Wang, Tianle Wang, Tomohiro Soejima, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker</i>
<p>Recent experiments on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene flakes with a
substrate induced moir\'e potential have identified both Chern insulators and
fractional Quantum Hall states in the absence of an applied magnetic field.
Surprisingly, these states are observed in strong displacement fields where the
effects of the moir\'e lattice are weak, and seem to be readily accessed
without fine-tuning. To address these experimental puzzles we study an
interacting model of electrons in this geometry, first within the
self-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) approximation. We find an isolated Chern
band with Chern number $|C|=1$, that moreover is relatively flat and shows good
quantum geometry. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization
group methods at fractional filling establish the presence of fractional
quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states. The $|C|=1$ band in SCHF is remarkably
robust to varying microscopic parameters, and is also found in the $N_L=4$ and
$N_L=6$ layer systems. Remarkably, it appears stable even to switching off the
moir\'e potential, pointing to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. We
term this topological crystalline state the ``anomalous Hall crystal" (AHC),
and argue that it constitutes a general mechanism for creating stable Chern
bands in rhombohedral graphene. Our work elucidates the physics behind the
recent rhombohedral pentalayer graphene observations, predicts the appearance
of the same phase in other systems, and opens the door to studying the
interplay between electronic topology and spontaneous translation symmetry
breaking.

<h3>Theoretical insights into the chemical bonding, electronic structure,  and spectroscopic properties of the lanarkite Pb$_2$SO$_5$ structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05569" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05569</a>
<br>
<i>Guilherme da Silva Lopes Fabris, Mateus Meneghetti Ferrer, Julio Ricardo Sambrano, Cláudio Romero Rodrigues de Almeida, Carlos Alberto Paskocimas, Felipe de Almeida La Porta</i>
<p>This article provides a comprehensive investigation on the chemical bonding,
electronic structure, and spectroscopic properties of the lanarkite-type PSO
structure from a computational perspective. Thus, different functionals in the
field of DFT (e.g., PBE, PBE0, PBESOL, PBESOL0, BLYP, WC1LYP and B3LYP) using a
triple-zeta valence plus polarization basis set were assessed to accurate
prediction their fundamental properties. Among all DFT functionals tested in
this study, in particular, the PBE was the one that showed the best agreement
with the experimental data available in the literature. Our results also reveal
that the [PbO$_5$] clusters are formed with three different Pb--O bond lengths,
with values of about 2.32, 2.59 and 2.84\AA, respectively, and the [SO$_4$]
clusters have the same S--O bond length of 1.57\AA. We then performed a
complete topological analysis of this system to better understand these
structural differences. Additionally, the PSO structure has an indirect band
gap energy of 2.9 eV and an effective mass ratio of about 0.415 (using PBE
calculations) which may, in principle, indicate a low recombination of
electro-hole pairs in the lanarkite structure. Therefore, we believe that a
detailed understanding of their electronic structure and spectroscopic
properties as well as their chemical bonding is critically important for
developing new technologies based on PSO.

<h3>Deformation of a Néel-type Skyrmion in a Weak Inhomogeneous Magnetic  Field: Magnetization Ansatz and Interaction with a Pearl Vortex</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05578</a>
<br>
<i>S. S. Apostoloff, E. S. Andriyakhina, I. S. Burmistrov</i>
<p>In this work, we develop a theory of (meta)stable states of N\'eel-type
skyrmions in weak nonuniform magnetic fields. We claim a novel ansatz for
modeling the non-symmetric magnetization that can be implied for both analytics
and numerical simulations. Our theory accounts for changes in the size skyrmion
parameters and also includes deformations from the centrally symmetric shape.
The ansatz streamlines the analytic calculation of the skyrmion free energy,
enhancing the efficiency of the minimizing process. Performing the minimization
in two stages, one can find all the minima, global and local, of the free
energy, discovering the stable and metastable states. We apply the developed
methodology to investigate the (meta)stable configurations of skyrmions
influenced by the stray field of a Pearl vortex. Our study reveals the
dependence of skyrmion spatial parameters on the vortex field effective
strength and presents a phase diagram identifying regions where metastable
configurations are predicted. Corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, our
findings offer a detailed perspective on the interaction between magnetic
skyrmions and superconducting vortices.

<h3>Thermodynamic phases in first detected return times of quantum many-body  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05585" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05585</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Walter, Gabriele Perfetto, Andrea Gambassi</i>
<p>We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial
state of a quantum many-body system subject to stroboscopic projective
measurements. We show that this distribution can be interpreted as a
continuation of the canonical partition function of a spin chain with
non-interacting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterised by the
Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to show
that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially
asymptotically in time, depending on whether the spin model displays a
ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example
of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing
a rich phase behaviour, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time with
$N$. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by exact numerical
computations.

<h3>Landau Damping in an Electron Gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05611" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05611</a>
<br>
<i>I.S. Tupitsyn, N.V. Prokof'ev</i>
<p>Material science methods aim at developing efficient computational schemes
for describing complex many-body effects and how to observe them in
experiments. Bethe-Salpeter equation in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock basis
is often used for this purpose, but so far it was not possible to complete the
task numerically exactly on the real frequency axis at finite temperature. In
this paper we employ the real-frequency diagrammatic Monte Carlo framework for
solving the ladder-type Bethe-Salpeter equation for the 3-point vertex function
(and, ultimately, for the system's polarization) to study the effect of
electron-hole Coulomb scattering on Landau damping in the homogeneous electron
gas. We establish how this damping mechanism depends on the Coulomb parameter
$r_s$ and changes with temperature between the correlated liquid and thermal
gas regimes. In a broader context of dielectric response in metals, we also
present the typical dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel on frequency
at finite momentum and temperature within the same theoretical framework.
