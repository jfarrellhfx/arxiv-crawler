<h3>Intervalley coherence and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in rhombohedral  trilayer graphene</h3>

Rhombohedral graphene multilayers provide a clean and highly reproducible
platform to explore the emergence of superconductivity and magnetism in a
strongly interacting electron system. Here, we use electronic compressibility
and local magnetometry to explore the phase diagram of this material class in
unprecedented detail. We focus on rhombohedral trilayer in the quarter metal
regime, where the electronic ground state is characterized by the occupation of
a single spin and valley isospin flavor. Our measurements reveal a subtle
competition between valley imbalanced (VI) orbital ferromagnets and intervalley
coherent (IVC) states in which electron wave functions in the two momentum
space valleys develop a macroscopically coherent relative phase. Contrasting
the in-plane spin susceptibility of the IVC and VI phases reveals the influence
of graphene's intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, which drives the emergence of a
distinct correlated phase with hybrid VI and IVC character. Spin-orbit also
suppresses the in-plane magnetic susceptibility of the VI phase, which allows
us to extract the spin-orbit coupling strength of $\lambda \approx 50\mu$eV for
our hexagonal boron nitride-encapsulated graphene system. We discuss the
implications of finite spin-orbit coupling on the spin-triplet superconductors
observed in both rhombohedral and twisted graphene multilayers.

<h3>Categorical Landau Paradigm for Gapped Phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03786" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03786</a>

<i>Lakshya Bhardwaj, Lea E. Bottini, Daniel Pajer, Sakura Schafer-Nameki</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a unified framework to classify gapped infra-red (IR) phases with
categorical symmetries, leading to a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm.
This is applicable in any dimension and gives a succinct, comprehensive, and
computationally powerful approach to classifying gapped symmetric phases. The
key tool is the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), which is a one
dimension higher TFT with two boundaries, which we choose both to be
topological. We illustrate the general idea for (1+1)d gapped phases with
categorical symmetries and suggest higher-dimensional extensions.

<h3>Mobile Impurity in a Two-Leg Bosonic Ladder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03793" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03793</a>
<br>

We study the dynamics of a mobile impurity in a two-leg bosonic ladder. The
impurity moves both along and across the legs and interacts with a bath of
interacting bosonic particles present in the ladder. We use both analytical
(Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid - TLL) and numerical (Density Matrix Renormalization
Group - DMRG) methods to compute the Green's function of the impurity. We find
that for a small impurity-bath interaction, the bonding mode of the impurity
effectively couples only to the gapless mode of the bath while the anti-bonding
mode of the impurity couples to both gapped and gapless mode of the bath. We
compute the time dependence of the Green's function of the impurity, for
impurity created either in the anti-bonding or bonding mode with a given
momentum. The later case leads to a decay as a power-law below a critical
momentum and exponential above, while the former case always decays
exponentially. We compare the DMRG results with analytical results using the
linked cluster expansion and find a good agreement. In addition we use DMRG to
extract the lifetime of the quasi-particle, when the Green's function decays
exponentially. We also treat the case of an infinite bath-impurity coupling for
which both the bonding and antibonding modes are systematically affected. For
this case the impurity Green's function in the bonding mode decays as a
power-law at zero momentum.The corresponding exponent increases with increasing
transverse-tunneling of the impurity. We compare our results with the other
impurity problems for which the motion of either the impurity or the bath is
limited to a single chain. Finally we comments on the consequences of our
findings for experiments with the ultracold gasses.

<h3>Iterative construction of conserved quantities in dissipative nearly  integrable systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03809" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03809</a>

<br>
<br>
Integrable systems offer rare examples of solvable many-body problems in the
quantum world. Due to the fine-tuned structure, their realization in nature and
experiment is never completely accurate, therefore effects of integrability are
observed only transiently. One way to surpass that is to couple nearly
integrable systems to baths and driving: these will stabilize integrable
effects up to arbitrary time, as encoded in the time dependent, and eventually,
the stationary state of form of a generalized Gibbs ensemble. However, the
description of such driven dissipative nearly integrable models is challenging
and no exact analytical methods have been proposed so far. Here we develop an
iterative scheme in which integrability breaking perturbations (baths)
determine the most necessary conserved quantities to be added into a truncated
generalized Gibbs ensemble description. Our scheme significantly reduces the
complexity of the problem, paving the way for thermodynamic results.

<h3>Influence of disorder on antidot vortex Majorana states in 3D  topological insulators</h3>

Topological insulator/superconductor two-dimensional heterostructures are
promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana
modes. In these systems, a vortex pinned by a pre-fabricated antidot in the
superconductor can host Majorana zero-energy modes (MZMs), which are exotic
quasiparticles that may enable quantum information processing. However, a major
challenge is to design devices that can manipulate the information encoded in
these MZMs. One of the key factors is to create small and clean antidots, so
that the MZMs, localized in the vortex core, have a large gap to other
excitations. If the antidot is too large or too disordered, the level spacing
for the subgap vortex states may become smaller than temperature. In this
paper, we numerically investigate the effects of disorder, chemical potential,
and antidot size on the subgap vortex spectrum, using a two-dimensional
effective model of the topological insulator surface. Our model allows us to
simulate large system sizes with vortices up to 1.8 $\mu$m in diameter. We also
compare our disorder model with the transport data from existing experiments.
We find that the spectral gap can exhibit a non-monotonic behavior as a
function of disorder strength, and that it can be tuned by applying a gate
voltage.

Recent investigations into MoB$_{2}$ have unveiled a direct connection
between a pressure-induced structural transition to a P6/$mmm$ space group
structure and the emergence of superconductivity, producing critical
temperatures up to 32 K at 100 GPa. This pressure-induced superconducting state
underscores the potential of doped MoB$_{2}$ as a possible candidate for
metastable superconductivity at ambient pressure. In this work, we demonstrate
that doping by Zr, Hf, or Ta stabilizes the P6/$mmm$ structure at ambient
pressure and results in the realization of a superconducting state with
critical temperatures ranging from 2.4 up to 8.5 K depending on the specific
doping. We estimate the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ and the density of
states based on resistivity and specific heat data, finding that $\lambda$
ranges from 0.4 - 0.6 for these compounds. Finally, to investigate the role of
possible metastable defect structures on the critical temperature, we analyze
MoB$_{2}$, MoB$_{2.5}$, and Nb/Zr-doped MoB$_{2}$ using rapid cooling
techniques. Notably, splat-quenching produces samples with higher critical
temperatures and even retains superconductivity in MoB$_{2}$ at ambient
pressure, achieving a critical temperature of 4.5 K.

<h3>Serrated plastic flow in slowly-deforming complex concentrated alloys:  universal signatures of dislocation avalanches</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03828" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03828</a>
<br>
<i>Kamran Karimi, Amin Esfandiarpour, Stefanos Papanikolaou</i>
<br>
<br>
Under plastic flow, multi-element high/medium-entropy alloys (HEAs/MEAs)
commonly exhibit complex intermittent and collective dislocation dynamics owing
to inherent lattice distortion and atomic-level chemical complexities. Using
atomistic simulations, we report on an avalanche study of slowly-driven model
face-centered cubic (fcc) NiCoCrFeMn and NiCoCr chemically complex alloys
aiming for microstructural/topological characterization of associated
dislocation avalanches. The results of our avalanche simulations reveal a close
correspondence between the observed serration features in the stress response
of the deforming HEA/MEA and the incurred slip patterns within the bulk
crystal. We show that such correlations become quite pronounced within the
rate-independent (quasi-static) regime exhibiting scale-free statistics and
critical scaling features as universal signatures of dislocation avalanches.

<h3>Collective excitations and screening in two-dimensional tilted  nodal-line semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03835</a>
<br>
<i>Hamid Rahimpoor, Saeed H. Abedinpour</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological nodal-line semimetals are characterized by symmetry-protected
one-dimensional band-touching lines or loops, which give rise to their peculiar
Fermi surfaces at low energies. Furthermore, if time-reversal or inversion
symmetry breaking tilts the bands, anisotropic Fermi surfaces hosting electron
and hole carriers simultaneously can also appear. We analytically investigate
the linear density-density response function of a two-dimensional tilted
nodal-line semimetal in the intrinsic and doped regimes. Despite the
anisotropic electronic bands, the polarizability remains isotropic in our model
system. We find that the plasmon dispersion in the long wavelength limit
exhibits a standard behavior that is proportional to the square root of the
wave vector, characteristic of two-dimensional electron liquids. Tilting tends
to enhance the plasmon frequency, and the Drude weight does not depend on the
carrier density at low doping levels. In these regimes, unlike the intrinsic
and highly-doped ones, the static polarizability has two distinct singularities
at finite wave vectors. This results in beat patterns in the Friedel
oscillations.

<h3>Resolving Length Scale Dependent Transient Disorder Through an Ultrafast  Phase Transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
Material functionality can be strongly determined by structure extending only
over nanoscale distances. The pair distribution function presents an
opportunity to shift structural studies beyond idealized crystal models and
investigate structure over varying length scales. Applying this method with
ultrafast time resolution has the potential to similarly disrupt the study of
structural dynamics and phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate such a
measurement of CuIr$_{2}$S$_{4}$ optically pumped from its low temperature
Ir-dimerized phase. Dimers are optically removed without spatial correlation,
generating a structure whose level of disorder depends strongly on length
scale. The re-development of structural ordering over tens of picoseconds is
directly tracked over both space and time as a non-equilibrium state is
approached. This measurement demonstrates both the crucial role of local
structure and disorder in non-equilibrium processes and the feasibility of
accessing this information with state-of-the-art XFEL facilities.

<h3>Visualising emergent phenomena at oxide interfaces</h3>

<br>
<br>
Knowledge of atomic-level details of structure, chemistry, and electronic
states is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of emergent properties at
oxide interfaces. We utilise a novel methodology based on atomic-scale electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to spatially map the electronic states tied to
the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the prototypical
non-polar/polar $TiO_2$/$LaAlO_3$ interface. Combined with differential phase
contrast analysis we directly visualise the microscopic locations of ions and
charge and find that 2DEG states and $Ti^{3+}$ defect states exhibit different
spatial distributions. Supported by density functional theory (DFT) and
inelastic scattering simulations we examine the role of oxygen vacancies in
2DEG formation. Our work presents a general pathway to directly image emergent
phenomena at interfaces using this unique combination of arising microscopy
techniques with machine learning assisted data analysis procedures.

<h3>Performance of periodic EOM-CCSD for band gaps of inorganic  semiconductors and insulators</h3>

<br>

We calculate the band gaps of 12 inorganic semiconductors and insulators
composed of atoms from the first three rows of the periodic table using
periodic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with single and double
excitations (EOM-CCSD). Our calculations are performed with atom-centered
triple-zeta basis sets and up to 64 $k$-points in the Brillouin zone. We
analyze the convergence behavior with respect to number of orbitals and number
of $k$-points sampled, using composite corrections and extrapolations to
produce our final values. When accounting for electron-phonon corrections to
experimental band gaps, we find that EOM-CCSD has a mean signed error of
$-0.12$ eV and a mean absolute error of $0.42$ eV; the largest outliers are C
(error of $-0.93$ eV), BP ($-1.00$ eV), and LiH ($+0.78$ eV). Surprisingly, we
find that the more affordable partitioned EOM-MP2 theory performs as well as
EOM-CCSD.

<br>
<br>
We consider a smooth interface between a topological nodal-line semimetal and
a topologically trivial insulator (e.g., the vacuum) or another semimetal with
a nodal ring of different radius. Using a low-energy effective Hamiltonian
including only the two crossing bands, we show that these junctions accommodate
a two-dimensional zero-energy level and a set of two-dimensional dispersive
bands, corresponding to states localized at the interface. We characterize the
spectrum, identifying the parameter ranges in which these states are present,
and highlight the role of the nodal radius and the smoothness of the interface.
We also suggest material-independent ways to detect and identify these states,
using optical conductivity and infrared absorption spectroscopy in magnetic
field.

<h3>Density-functional perturbation theory for one-dimensional systems:  implementation and relevance for phonons and electron-phonon interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03907" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03907</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The electronic and vibrational properties and electron-phonon couplings of
one-dimensional materials will be key to many prospective applications in
nanotechnology. Dimensionality strongly affects these properties and has to be
correctly accounted for in first-principles calculations. Here we develop and
implement a formulation of density-functional and density-functional
perturbation theory that is tailored for one-dimensional systems. A key
ingredient is the inclusion of a Coulomb cutoff, a reciprocal-space technique
designed to correct for the spurious interactions between periodic images in
periodic-boundary conditions. This restores the proper one-dimensional
open-boundary conditions, letting the true response of the isolated
one-dimensional system emerge. In addition to total energies, forces and stress
tensors, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are also properly accounted
for. We demonstrate the relevance of the present method on a portfolio of
realistic systems: BN atomic chains, BN armchair nanotubes, and GaAs nanowires.
Notably, we highlight the critical role of the Coulomb cutoff by studying
previously inaccessible polar-optical phonons and Frohlich electron-phonon
couplings. We also develop and apply analytical models to support the physical
insights derived from the calculations and we discuss their consequences on
electronic lifetimes. The present work unlocks the possibility to accurately
simulate the linear response properties of one-dimensional systems, sheds light
on the transition between dimensionalities and paves the way for further
studies in several fields, including charge transport, optical coupling and
polaritronics.

<h3>Anisotropy of thermal conductivity oscillations in relation to the  Kitaev spin liquid phase</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the presence of external magnetic field, the Kitaev model could either
hosts gapped topological anyon or gapless Majorana fermions. In
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, the gapped and gapless cases are only separated by a
thirty-degree rotation of the in-plane magnetic field vector. The
presence/absence of the spectral gap is key for understanding the thermal
transport behavior in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Here, we study the anisotropy of the
oscillatory features of thermal conductivity in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We examine
the oscillatory features of thermal conductivities (k//a, k//b) with fixed
external fields and found distinct behavior for the gapped (B//a) and gapless
(B//b) scenarios. Furthermore, we track the evolution of thermal resistivity
($\lambda_{a}$) and its oscillatory features with the rotation of in-plane
magnetic fields from B//b to B//a. The thermal resistivity $\lambda (B,\theta)$
display distinct rotational symmetries before and after the emergence of the
field induced Kitaev spin liquid phase. These experiment data suggest close
correlations between the oscillatory features of thermal conductivity, the
underlying Kitaev spin liquid phase and the fermionic excitation it holds.

Gaussian Approximation Potentials are a class of Machine Learned Interatomic
Potentials routinely used to model materials and molecular systems on the
atomic scale. The software implementation provides the means for both fitting
models using ab initio data and using the resulting potentials in atomic
simulations. Details of the GAP theory, algorithms and software are presented,
together with detailed usage examples to help new and existing users. We review
some recent developments to the GAP framework, including MPI parallelisation of
the fitting code enabling its use on thousands of CPU cores and compression of

<h3>Hyperbolic phonon-polariton electroluminescence in graphene-hBN van der  Waals heterostructures</h3>

<br>
Phonon-polaritons are electromagnetic waves resulting from the coherent
coupling of photons with optical phonons in polar dielectrics. Due to their
exceptional ability to confine electric fields to deep subwavelength scales
with low loss, they are uniquely poised to enable a suite of applications
beyond the reach of conventional photonics, such as sub-diffraction imaging and
near-field energy transfer. The conventional approach to exciting
phonon-polaritons through optical methods, however, necessitates costly
mid-infrared and terahertz coherent light sources along with near-field
scanning probes, and generally leads to low excitation efficiency due to the
substantial momentum mismatch between phonon-polaritons and free-space photons.
Here, we demonstrate that under proper conditions, phonon-polaritons can be
excited all-electrically by flowing charge carriers. Specifically, in hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures, by electrically driving charge
carriers in ultra-high-mobility graphene out of equilibrium, we observe bright
electroluminescence of hBN's hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-IR
frequencies. The HPhP electroluminescence shows a temperature and carrier
density dependence distinct from black-body or super-Planckian thermal
emission. Moreover, the carrier density dependence of HPhP electroluminescence
spectra reveals that HPhP electroluminescence can arise from both inter-band
transition and intra-band Cherenkov radiation of charge carriers in graphene.
The HPhP electroluminescence offers fundamentally new avenues for realizing
electrically-pumped, tunable mid-IR and THz phonon-polariton lasers, and
efficient cooling of electronic devices.

<br>
Within the scattering matrix approach to electronic transport, the scattering
and transport properties of tight-binding random graphs are analyzed. In
particular, we compute the scattering matrix elements, the transmission, the
channel-to-channel transmission distributions (including the total transmission
distribution), the shot noise power, and the elastic enhancement factor. Two
graph models are considered: random geometric graphs and bipartite random
geometric graphs. The results show an insulating to a metallic crossover in the
scattering and transport properties by increasing the average degree of the
graphs from small to large values. Also, the scattering and transport
properties are shown to be invariant under a scaling parameter depending on the
average degree and the graph size. Furthermore, for large connectivity and in
the perfect coupling regime, the scattering and transport properties of both
graph models are well described by the random matrix theory predictions of
electronic transport, except for bipartite graphs in particular scattering
setups.

<h3>Multi-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy of Light-Driven States and their  Collective Modes in Multi-Band Superconductors</h3>

<i>Martin Mootz, Liang Luo, Chuankun Huang, Jigang Wang, llias E. Perakis</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive theory of light-controlled multi-band
superconductivity and apply it to predict distinctive signatures of
light-driven superconducting (SC) states in terahertz multi-dimensional
coherent spectroscopy (THz-MDCS) experiments. We first derive gauge-invariant
Maxwell-Bloch equations for multi-band BCS superconductors. For this, we go
beyond previously considered Anderson pseudo-spin precession models to include
quantum transport effects. By calculating the THz-MDCS spectra measured
experimentally, we then identify unique signatures of finite-momentum
Cooper-pairing states that live longer than the laser pulse. These
non-equilibrium SC states are characterized by long-lived canting of Anderson
pseudo-spins. The pseudo-spin oscillators that describe the properties of these
SC states are parametrically driven by both finite-momentum Cooper pairing and
by time oscillations of the order parameter relative phase. We show that such
strong parametric driving leads to drastic changes in the THz-MDCS spectral
shape from the predictions of third-order nonlinear susceptibility
calculations. These spectral changes strongly depend on the
interband-to-intraband interaction ratio and on the collective modes of the
light-driven state.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic magnonic charge current generation via ultrafast  optical excitation</h3>

N\'eel spin-orbit torque allows a charge current pulse to efficiently
manipulate the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets, which offers a unique
opportunity for ultrahigh density information storage with high speed. However,
the reciprocal process of N\'eel spin-orbit torque, the generation of ultrafast
charge current in antiferromagnets has not been demonstrated. Here, we report
the experimental observation of charge current generation in antiferromagnetic
metallic Mn2Au thin films using ultrafast optical excitation. The ultrafast
laser pulse excites antiferromagnetic magnons, resulting in instantaneous
non-equilibrium spin polarization at the antiferromagnetic spin sublattices
with broken spatial symmetry. Then the charge current is generated directly via
spin-orbit fields at the two sublattices, which is termed as the reciprocal
phenomenon of N\'eel spin-orbit torque, and the associated THz emission can be
detected at room temperature. Besides the fundamental significance on the
Onsager reciprocity, the observed magnonic charge current generation in
antiferromagnet would advance the development of antiferromagnetic THz emitter.

The development of two-dimensional (2D) room temperature magnets is of great
significance to the practical application of spintronic devices. However, the
number of synthesized intrinsic 2D magnets is limited and the performances of
them are not satisfactory, e.g. typically with low Curie temperature and poor
environmental stability. Magnetic modulation based on developed 2D materials,
especially non-magnetic 2D materials, can bring us new breakthroughs. Herein,
we report room temperature ferromagnetism in halogenated MoS2 monolayer under
the synergistic effect of strain engineering and charge injection, and the
combined implementation of these two processes is based on the halogenation of
MoS2. The adsorbed halogen atoms X (X = F, Cl, and Br) on the surface leads to
lattice superstretching and hole injection, resulting in MoS2 monolayer
exhibiting half-metallic properties, with one spin channel being gapless in the
band structure. The Curie temperature of halogenated MoS2 monolayer is 513~615
K, which is much higher than the room temperature. In addition, large magnetic
anisotropy energy and good environmental stability make halogenated MoS2
display great advantages in practical spintronic nanodevices.

Transverse magnetic focussing is the solid state equivalent of a mass
spectrometer. It is unique among 2D measurement techniques as it is able to
measure a well defined section of the Fermi surface, making it possible to
detect changes that would be averaged out over the whole Fermi surface. Here,
we utilise this unique property to probe non-adiabatic spin dynamics and spin
dependent scattering of holes. We combine spin-resolved magnetic focussing with
an additional independent in-plane magnetic field and observe a change in
focussing peak amplitude that is not symmetric with respect to the field
direction (i.e. $+B_{\parallel} \neq -B_{\parallel}$), and is extremely
sensitive to the magnitude of the in-plane magnetic field. We show that the
magnetic focussing signal is extremely sensitive to small changes in the Fermi
velocity, which can be used to detect small shifts in the Fermi surface caused
by an in-plane magnetic field. We also find that focussing can be used to
detect the proximity between spin-split Fermi surfaces, which cause
non-adiabatic spin dynamics.

Topological phononics enabling backscattering-immune transport is expected to
improve the performance of electromechanical systems for classical and quantum
information technologies. Nonetheless, most of the previous demonstrations
utilized macroscale and low-frequency structures and thus offered little
experimental insight into ultrahigh frequency phonon transport, especially in
chip-scale circuits. Here, we report microwave phonon transmissions in a
microscopic topological ring-waveguide coupled system, which is an important
building block for wave-based signal processing. The elastic waves in the
topological waveguide evanescently couple to the ring resonator, while
maintaining the valley pseudospin polarization. The resultant waves are robust
to backscattering even in the tiny hexagonal ring, generating a resonant phonon
circulation. Furthermore, the evanescently coupled structure allows for a
critical coupling, where valley-dependent ring-waveguide interference enables
blocking of the topological edge transmission. Our demonstrations reveal the
capability of using topological phenomena to manipulate ultrahigh frequency
elastic waves in intricate phononic circuits for classical and quantum
signal-processing applications.

A random search of a partially absorbing target by a run-and-tumble particle
in a confined one-dimensional space is investigated. We analytically obtain the
mean searching time, which shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the
self-propulsion speed of the active particle, indicating the existence of an
optimal speed, when the absorption strength of the target is finite. In the
limit of large and small absorption strengths, respectively, asymptotes of the
mean searching time and the optimal speed are found. We also demonstrate that
the first-passage problem of a diffusive run-and-tumble particle in high
dimensions can be mapped into a one-dimensional problem with a partially
absorbing target. Finally, as a practical application exploiting the existence
of the optimal speed, we propose a filtering device to extract active particles
with a desired speed and evaluate how the resolution of the filtering device
depends on the absorption strength.

<br>
Multi-principal element alloys open large composition spaces for alloy
development. The large compositional space necessitates rapid synthesis and
characterization to identify promising materials, as well as predictive
strategies for alloy design. Additive manufacturing via directed energy
deposition is demonstrated as a high-throughput technique for synthesizing
alloys in the Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni quaternary system. More than 100 compositions are
synthesized in a week, exploring a broad range of compositional space. Uniform
compositional control to within +/-5 at% is achievable. The rapid synthesis is
combined with conjoint sample heat treatment (25 samples vs 1 sample), and
automated characterization including X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy, and nano-hardness measurements. The datasets of measured
properties are then used for a predictive strengthening model using an active
machine learning algorithm that balances exploitation and exploration. A
learned parameter that represents lattice distortion is trained using the alloy
compositions. This combination of rapid synthesis, characterization, and active
learning model results in new alloys that are significantly stronger than
previous investigated alloys.

<br>
<br>
Electronic correlation and reconstruction are two important factors that play
a critical role in shaping the magnetic and electronic properties of correlated
low-dimensional systems. Here, we report a competition between the electronic
correlation and structural reconstruction in La1-xSrxTiO3/SrTiO3
heterostructures by modulating material polarity and interfacial strain,
respectively. The heterostructures exhibit a critical thickness (tc) at which a
metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) abruptly occurs at certain thickness,
accompanied by the coexistence of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D)
carriers. Intriguingly, the tc exhibits a V-shaped dependence on the doping
concentration of Sr, with the smallest tc value at x = 0.5. We attribute this
V-shaped dependence to the competition between the electronic reconstruction
(modulated by the polarity) and the electronic correlation (modulated by
strain), which are borne out by the experimental results, including
strain-dependent electronic properties and the evolution of 2D and 3D carriers.
Our findings underscore the significance of the interplay between electronic
reconstruction and correlation in the realization and utilization of emergent
electronic functionalities in low-dimensional correlated systems.

We unravel the effect of La substitution and hence antisite disorders on the
exchange bias (EB) mechanism in Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CoNbO$_6$ ($x=$ 0, 0.2) double
perovskite samples using the detailed analysis of the field cooled
magnetization isotherms (M--H) and training effect. The field dependence of the
freezing temperature deviates from both Gabay-Toulouse (GT) and de
Almeida-Thouless (AT) lines and the analysis suggests that the $x=$ 0 sample
follows a different universality class with moderate anisotropy in the frozen
spins. Interestingly, we find that the EB effect is significantly suppressed in
the $x=$ 0.2 sample due to increase [decrease] in the size of ferromagnetic
(FM) [cluster glass (CG)] domain, which reduces the effective disordered
interface responsible for the EB. The changes in fraction of FM, AFM, and CG
like interactions with the La substitution and applied magnetic field are found
to be crucial in governing the EB effect in these samples. Further, the
training effect measurements show the unequal shift in the left and right
branches of the M--H loops and their different evolution with the field cycles
($n$). The analysis reveals that the rotatable spins relax approximately one
order of magnitude faster than the frozen spins at the disordered interface. We
find a possible correlation between the observed EB effect and the antisite
disorders in these samples.

<br>
Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in
antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system
was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and
high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as
function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC
properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show
superconducting transition with critical temperature $T_c = 116^\circ$K at 184
GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the
superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL)
equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in
addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group

<br>
The nodal-line semimetals NaAlSi and NaAlGe have significantly different
ground states despite having similar electronic structures: NaAlSi exhibits
superconductivity below 7 K, while NaAlGe exhibits semiconductive electrical
conductivity at low temperatures, indicating the formation of a pseudogap at
approximately 100 K. The origin of the pseudogap in NaAlGe is unknown but may
be associated with excitonic instability. We investigated hole-doping effects
on the ground state in the solid solution Na(Al1-xZnx)Ge and discovered that
the pseudogap is suppressed continuously with increasing Zn content, followed
by the appearance of a superconducting dome with the highest transition
temperature of 2.8 K. This superconductivity most likely results from excitonic
fluctuations.

We report on the quantum criticality of Pr$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ revealed by our
new material research. Pr$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ has been synthesized by flux
growth and characterized by single X-ray, powder X-ray, and powder neutron
diffraction measurements. The compound adopts a Yb$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$-type
structure with a cubic Pm$\bar{3}$n. From the magnetization at 1 T, the
effective magnetic moment was estimated to be 3.58 $\mu _B$ per Pr$^{3+}$,
suggesting that the magnetism is mainly contributed by Pr$^{3+}$ ions. The
specific heat and magnetization show an anomaly at $T_{N} = 7.5$ ~ K owing to
the phase transition. The muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) time
spectra exhibit clear oscillations below $T_N$. This suggests that the phase is
magnetically ordered. The volume fraction of the magnetic phase estimated from
the initial asymmetry is around ten percent. In addition, spin fluctuations
were observed at low temperatures. These results provide microscopic evidence
that the material is closest to the antiferromagnetically quantum critical
point with a partial order among Pr$_3$$T_4$Sn$_{13}$ ($T= $ Co, Ru, Rh).

The evolution of charge carriers in photoexcited room temperature ZnO
nanoparticles in solution is investigated using ultrafast ultraviolet
photoluminescence spectroscopy, ultrafast Zn K-edge absorption spectroscopy and
ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The photoluminescence is excited
at 4.66 eV, well above the band edge, and shows that electron cooling in the
conduction band and exciton formation occur in <500 fs, in excellent agreement
with theoretical predictions. The X-ray absorption measurements, obtained upon
excitation close to the band edge at 3.49 eV, are sensitive to the migration
and trapping of holes. They reveal that the 2 ps transient largely reproduces
the previously reported transient obtained at 100 ps time delay in synchrotron
studies. In addition, the X-ray absorption signal is found to rise in ~1.4 ps,
which we attribute to the diffusion of holes through the lattice prior to their
trapping at singly-charged oxygen vacancies. Indeed, the MD simulations show
that impulsive trapping of holes induces an ultrafast expansion of the cage of
Zn atoms in <200 fs, followed by an oscillatory response at a frequency of ~100
cm-1, which corresponds to a phonon mode of the system involving the Zn
sub-lattice.

In a recent experiment on the interlayer magnetoresistance in the
quasi-two-dimensional organic salt, $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$, it has been
observed that at low temperatures, interlayer tunneling attains phase
coherence, leading to the emergence of a three-dimensional electronic
structure. Theoretically and experimentally it has been suggested that the
system exhibits characteristics of a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal as a
consequence of broken time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. Here, we
perform a theoretical calculation of the magnetoconductivity under an in-plane
magnetic field and demonstrate that the system displays a planar Hall effect.
Our calculations are based on a realistic model for
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ incorporating interlayer tunneling and the tilt of
the Dirac cone. Given that the planar Hall effect is anticipated as a
consequence of chiral anomaly, our findings provide support for the
classification of $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ as a three-dimensional Dirac
semimetal.

Recent experiments in twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ revealed the existence of
anisotropic Luttinger liquid behavior. To generically characterize such
anisotropic twisted bilayer systems, we study a model of twisted bilayer of 2D
arrays of coupled wires, which effectively form an array of coupled moir\'e
wires. We solve the model by transfer matrix method, and identify quasi-1D
electron bands in the system at small twist angles. With electron interactions
added, we show that the moir\'e wires have an effective Luttinger parameter
$g_\text{eff}$ much lower than that of the microscopic wires. This leads to a
sliding Luttinger liquid (SLL) temperature regime, in which power-law current
voltage relations arise. For parameters partly estimated from WTe$_2$, a
microscopic interaction $U\sim0.7$eV yields a temperature regime of SLL similar
to that in the WTe$_2$ experiments.

Few-layer graphene possesses low-energy carriers which behave as massive
fermions, exhibiting intriguing properties in both transport and light
scattering experiments. By lowering the excitation energy of resonance Raman
spectroscopy down to 1.17 eV we target these massive quasiparticles in the
low-energy split bands close to the K point. The low excitation energy
suppresses some of the Raman processes which are resonant in the visible, and
induces a clearer frequency-separation of the sub-structures of the resonant 2D
peak. Studying the different intensities of the sub-structures and comparing
experimental measurements with fully ab initio theoretical calculations, in the
case of bilayer graphene we unveil an enhanced coupling between the massive
fermions and the lattice vibrations at the K point, in analogy to what found
for the massless fermions of monolayer graphene, and also suggesting that what
governs the enhancement is the vicinity of the electron-hole pair momentum to K
rather than how small the electron-hole pair energy is.

The silicide superconductors (Ta, Nb, Zr)OsSi are among the best candidate
materials for investigating the interplay of topological order and
superconductivity. Here, we investigate in detail the normal-state topological
properties of (Ta, Nb, Zr)OsSi, focusing on ZrOsSi, by employing a combination
of $^{29}$Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements and first-principles
band-structure calculations. We show that, while (Ta, Nb)OsSi behave as almost
ideal metals, characterized by weak electronic correlations and a relatively
low density of states, the replacement of Ta (or Nb) with Zr expands the
crystal lattice and shifts ZrOsSi towards an insulator. Our ab initio
calculations indicate that ZrOsSi is a $Z_2$ topological metal with clear
surface Dirac cones and properties similar to a doped strong topological
insulator.

Two-dimensional MoS$_2$ combines many interesting properties that make the
material a top candidate for a variety of applications. It exhibits a high
electron mobility comparable to graphene, a direct fundamental band gap,
relatively strongly bound excitons, and moderate spin-orbit coupling. For a
thorough understanding of all these properties, an accurate description of the
electronic structure is mandatory. Surprisingly, published band gaps of MoS$_2$
obtained with $GW$, the state-of-the-art in electronic-structure calculations,
are quite scattered, ranging from 2.31 to 2.97 eV. The details of $G_0W_0$
calculations, such as the underlying geometry, the starting point, the
inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, and the treatment of the Coulomb potential
can critically determine how accurate the results are. In this manuscript, we
employ the linearized augmented planewave + local orbital method to
systematically investigate how all these aspects affect the quality of $G_0W_0$
calculations, and also provide a summary of literature data. We conclude that
the best overall agreement with experiments and coupled-cluster calculations is
found for $G_0W_0$ results with HSE06 as a starting point including spin-orbit
coupling, a truncated Coulomb potential, and an analytical treatment of the
singularity at $q=0$.

Processes of coalescence and fragmentation are used to understand the
time-evolution of the mass distribution of various systems and may result in a
steady state or in stable deterministic or stochastic cycles. Motivated by
applications in insurgency warfare we investigate coalescence-fragmentation
systems. We begin with a simple model of size-biased coalescence accompanied by
shattering into monomers. Depending on the parameters this model has an
approximately power-law-distributed steady state or stochastic cycles of
alternating gelation and shattering. We conduct stochastic simulations of this
model and its generalizations to include different kernel types, accretion and
erosion, and various distributions of non-shattering fragmentation. Our central
aim is to explore the robustness of the steady state and gel-shatter cycles to
these variations. We show that an approximate power-law steady state persists
with the addition of accretion and erosion, and with partial rather than total
shattering. However, broader distributions of fragment sizes typically vitiate
both the power law steady state and gel-shatter cyclicity. This work clarifies
features shown in coalescence/fragmentation model simulations and elucidates
the relationship between the microscopic dynamics and observed phenomena in
this widely applicable interdisciplinary model type.

Density functional theory (DFT) is the de facto approach for predicting
self-consistent-field electronic structures of ground-state configurations of
complex atoms, molecules, and solids and providing their property data for
materials discovery and design. This capability is greatly enabled by the
generalized gradient approximation for exchange-correlation interactions with
an important set of exchange-correlation functionals developed by John Perdew
and his collaborators in last several decades. The scientific community and the
present author's group have greatly benefited from this capability. Over the
years, the present author's group has integrated the energetics from DFT-based
calculations both at zero K and finite temperature into thermodynamic modeling
and developed methods to predict tracer diffusivity, elastic coefficients,
interfacial energy, and a number of other properties related to the derivatives
of free energy. One key outcome is the accurate prediction of free energy of a
system through the consideration of both ground-state and stable
symmetry-breaking non-ground-state configurations. It is articulated that
phonon properties of all individual configurations can be accurately calculated
by quasiharmonic approximations in the temperature and volume ranges of
interest, and the emergent behaviors and anharmonicity of a system originate
primarily from the statistical competition among all the configurations.

We study interlayer pairing of composite fermions in the total $\nu=1/2+1/2$
quantum Hall bilayer as a possible framework for understanding the
experimentally observed transition from a compressible state at large layer
spacing to a bilayer quantum Hall state at small layer spacing. We consider a
model in which the effective interlayer composite fermion pairing interaction
mediated by the Chern-Simons gauge fields in the two layers is singular with
both attractive (out-of-phase) and repulsive (in-phase) components diverging at
low frequency. If only the more singular attractive interaction is included the
pairing gap obtained by solving the gap equation is proportional to the inverse
of the layer spacing squared. In the so-called local approximation, we find
that when the less singular repulsive interactions are also included the
pairing gap still falls off as inverse layer spacing squared, consistent with
recent analyses, but is strongly suppressed to a degree that may account for
the fact that this predicted inverse square dependence is not observed
experimentally. The analytically obtained local approximation solutions are
then used as a starting point to numerically iterate the full gap equation to
assess the validity of the approximation in this limit.

Binary mixtures of water with lower alcohols display non-linear phase
behaviour upon mixing which are attributed to potential cluster formation at
molecular level. Unravelling such elusive structures requires the investigation
of hydrogen-bonding sub-nanosecond dynamics. We employ high-resolution neutron
time-of-flight spectroscopy with polarization analysis in combination with
selective deuteration to study the concentration-dependent structural dynamics,
in the water rich part of the phase diagram of water-ethanol mixtures. This
method enables the simultaneous access to atomic correlations in space and
time, and allows us to separate spatially incoherent scattering probing
self-diffusion of the ethanol fraction from the coherent scattering probing
collective diffusion of the water network as a whole. Our observations indicate
an enhanced rigidity of the hydrogen bond network at mesoscopic lengthscale
compared to the intra-molecular scale as the ethanol fraction increases, which
is consistent with the hypothesis of clusters.

While it is widely accepted that the steel-concrete interface (SCI) plays an
important role in governing the long-term durability of reinforced concrete
structures, understanding about the primary features of the SCI that influence
corrosion degradation mechanisms has remained elusive. This lack of knowledge
can be attributed, on the one hand, to the complex heterogeneous nature of the
SCI, and, on the other hand, the absence of experimental techniques suitable
for studying the relevant features of the SCI. Here, we use focused ion beam -
scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) nanotomography to obtain high resolution
3D tomograms of the steel-concrete interfacial zone. Five tomograms, spanning
volumes ranging from 8,000 to 200,000 cubic micrometer, were acquired for
situations representative of both non-corroded and corroded SCIs. The achieved
voxel size falls within the range of 30-50 nm, thus providing a resolution
clearly surpassing the capabilities of computed X-ray tomography. This
resolution enables the 3D characterization of the microstructure at the
capillary scale, which is the scale at which relevant corrosion and related
mass transport processes occur. Thus, FIB-SEM nanotomography is capable of
yielding datasets of the SCI that serve as basis for the generation of digital
twins of the interfacial microstructure, thereby enabling future studies about
durability and corrosion of reinforced concrete at the pore scale.

Within ten years, flat band (FB) superconductivity has gained a huge interest
for its remarkable features and connection to quantum geometry. We investigate
the superconductivity in a FB system whose orbitals are inequivalent and in
which the gap and the quantum metric are tunable. The key feature of the
present theoretical study is to show a unique and simple constrain relation
that pairings obey. Furthermore, pairings and superfluid weight in partially
filled FB are shown to be controlled by those of the half-filled lattice. We
argue that the geometry of the lattice or the complexity of the hopping terms
have no impact on the features revealed in this work as far as the system is
bipartite.

Kagome metals are reported to exhibit remarkable properties, including
superconductivity, charge density wave order, and a large anomalous Hall
conductivity, which facilitate the implementation of spintronic devices. In
this work, we study a novel kagome metal based on Mn magnetic sites in a
KMn$_3$Sb$_5$ stoichiometry. By means of first-principles density functional
theory calculations, we demonstrate that the studied compound is dynamically
stable, locking the ferromagnetic order as the ground state configuration, thus
preventing the charge-density-wave state as reported in its vanadium-based
counterpart KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our calculations predict that KMn$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits
an out-of-plane (001) ferromagnetic response as the ground state, allowing for
the emergence of topologically protected Weyl nodes near the Fermi level and
nonzero anomalous Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{ij}$) in this centrosymmetric
system. We obtain a tangible $\sigma_{xy} = 314$ S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ component,
which is comparable to that of other kagome metals. Finally, we explore the
effect of the on-site Coulomb repulsion ($+U$) on the structural and electronic
properties and find that, although the lattice parameters and $\sigma_{xy}$
moderately vary with increasing $+U$, KMn$_3$Sb$_5$ stands as an ideal stable
ferromagnetic kagome metal with a large anomalous Hall conductivity response.

We construct the simplest density functional for the problem of a single
impurity interacting with a Fermi gas via a long--ranged potential using the
Thomas--Fermi approach. We find that the Fermi polaron is fully bosonized in
two dimensions, as the model results in a suitable Landau--Pekar functional
known from the Bose polaron problem which describes a self--interacting
impurity. In other dimensions, the impurity self--interacts with an infinite
number of its own images, and no bosonization occurs. We discuss applications
of our theory for the $2d$ exciton--polaron and the ionic polaron problem and
compute the effective mass for these cases, finding a self--trapping transition
with order depending on the dimensionality.

The formation of shear shock waves in the brain has been proposed as one of
the plausible explanations for deep intracranial injuries. In fact, such
singular solutions emerge naturally in soft viscoelastic tissues under dynamic
loading conditions. To improve our understanding of the mechanical processes at
hand, the development of dedicated computational models is needed. The present
study concerns three-dimensional numerical models of incompressible
viscoelastic solids whose motion is analysed by means of shock-capturing finite
volume methods. More specifically, we focus on the use of the artificial
compressibility method, a technique that has been frequently employed in
computational fluid dynamics. The material behaviour is deduced from the
Fung--Simo quasi-linear viscoelasiticity theory (QLV) where the elastic
response is of Yeoh type. We analyse the accuracy of the method and demonstrate
its applicability for the study of nonlinear wave propagation in soft solids.
The numerical results cover accuracy tests, shock formation and wave
diffraction.

Pulsed laser deposition has been used to deposit Y1Ba2Cu3O7 layer on CeO2
buffer layers on (1102) sapphire. Both layers are epitaxial with the (110)
direction of the CeO2 layer aligned with the <2021> direction of the sapphire
substrate. The c-axis Y1Ba2Cu3O7 layer has its <100> direction aligned with the
<110> direction of the CeO2. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy
shows the epitaxy to be coherent and the interfaces to be abrupt at an atomic
level. The best films have a critical current of 9 e6 A/cm2 at 4.2 K and lower
microwave surface resistance than copper at 77 K and at a frequency of 31 GHz.

<h3>Tuning topological superconductivity within the $t$-$J$-$U$ model of  twisted bilayer cuprates</h3>

We carry out a theoretical study of unconventional superconductivity in
twisted bilayer cuprates as a function of electron density and layer twist
angle. The bilayer $t$-$J$-$U$ model is employed and analyzed within the
framework of a generalized variational wave function approach in the
statistically-consistent Gutzwiller formulation. The constructed phase diagram
encompasses both gapless $d$-wave state (reflecting the pairing symmetry of
untwisted copper-oxides) and gapped $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ phase that
breaks spontaneously time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) and is characterized by
nontrivial Chern number. We find that $d+\mathrm{e}^{i\varphi}d$ state occupies
a non-convex butterfly-shaped region in the doping vs. twist-angle plane, and
demonstrate the presence of previously unreported reentrant TRS-breaking phase
on the underdoped side of the phase diagram. This circumstance supports the
emergence of topological superconductivity for fine-tuned twist angles away
from $45^\circ$. Our analysis of the microscopically derived Landau free energy
functional points toward sensitivity of the superconducting order parameter to
small perturbations close to the topological state boundary.

We use polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy to show that for 3D giant
Rashba system the bulk plasmon collective mode directly couples to the Raman
response even in the long wavelength $\mathbf q \rightarrow 0$ limit although
the standard theory predicts that the plasmon spectral weight should scale as
the square of its quasi-momentum and hence be negligibly weak in the Raman
spectra. Such plasmon coupling to the Raman response at $\mathbf q \rightarrow
0$ arises for a polar system with spin-orbit coupling when the incoming photon
excitation is turned to a resonance with Rashba-split intermediates states
involved in the resonant Raman process. As an example, we identify special
features of BiTeI's chiral band structure that enable the appearance of plasmon
mode in the Raman spectrum.

<h3>Microscopic origin of the quantum Mpemba effect in integrable systems</h3>

The highly complicated nature of far from equilibrium systems can lead to a
complete breakdown of the physical intuition developed in equilibrium. A famous
example of this is the Mpemba effect, which states that non-equilibrium states
may relax faster when they are further from equilibrium or, put another way,
hot water can freeze faster than warm water. Despite possessing a storied
history, the precise criteria and mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon are
still not known. Here we study a quantum version of the Mpemba effect that
takes place in closed many body systems with a U(1) conserved charge: in
certain cases a more asymmetric initial configuration relaxes and restores the
symmetry faster than a more symmetric one. In contrast to the classical case,
we establish the criteria for this to occur in arbitrary integrable quantum
systems using the recently introduced entanglement asymmetry. We describe the
quantum Mpemba effect in such systems and relate properties of the initial
state, specifically its charge fluctuations, to the criteria for its
occurrence. These criteria are expounded using exact analytic and numerical
techniques in several examples, a free fermion model, the Rule 54 cellular
automaton, and the Lieb-Liniger model.
