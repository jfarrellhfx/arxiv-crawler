<h3>Permissible domain walls in monoclinic MAB ferroelectric phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01324</a>

<i>Ido Biran, Semen Gorfman</i>

The concept of monoclinic ferroelectric phases has been extensively used over
recent decades for the understanding of ferroelectric materials. Monoclinic
phases have been actively invoked to describe the phase boundaries such as
Morphotropic Phase Boundary in functional perovskite oxides. These phases are
believed to play the major role in the enhancement of functional properties
such as dielectricity and electromechanical coupling through rotation of
spontaneous polarization and modification of the rich domain microstructures.
Unfortunately, such microstructures remain poorly understood due to the
complexity of the subject. The goal of this work is to formulate the
geometrical laws behind the monoclinic domain microstructures. Specifically, we
implement the result of our previous work (Gorfman et al, 2022) to catalogue
and outline some properties of permissible domain walls that connect strain
domains with monoclinic (MAB type) symmetry, occurring in ferroelectric
perovskite oxides. The term permissible (Fousek & Janovec, 1969) pertains to
the domain walls, connecting a pair of strain domains without a lattice
mismatch. We found that 12 monoclinic domains may form pairs connected along 84
types of permissible domain walls. These contain 48 domain walls with fixed
Miller indices (known as W-walls) and 36 domain walls whose Miller indices may
change when free lattice parameters change as well (known as S-walls). We
provide simple analytical expressions for the orientation of these domain
walls, the matrices of transformation between crystallographic basis vectors
and for the separation between Bragg peaks, diffracted from each of the pairs
of domains, connected along 84 permissible domain walls. The resultscan
contribute to the understanding and facilitate investigation of complex
monoclinic domain microstructures.

<h3>Fundamentals of the Oldroyd-B model revisited: Tensorial vs. vectorial  theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01326</a>
<br>
<i>Aaron Brunk, Joydip Chaudhuri, Maria Lukacova-Medvidova, Burkhard Duenweg</i>
<br>
<br>
The standard derivation of the Oldroyd-B model starts from a coupled system
of the momentum equation for the macroscopic flow on the one hand, and
Fokker-Planck dynamics for molecular dumbbells on the other. The constitutive
equation is then derived via a closure based upon the second moment of the
end-to-end vector distribution. We here present an alternative closure that is
rather based upon the first moment, and gives rise to an even simpler
constitutive equation. We establish that both closures are physically sound,
since both can be derived from (different) well-defined non-equilibrium
ensembles, and both are consistent with the Second Law of thermodynamics. In
contrast to the standard model, the new model has a free energy and a
dissipation rate that are both regular at vanishing conformation tensor. We
speculate that this might perhaps alleviate the well-known high Weissenberg
number problem, i. e. severe numerical instabilities of the standard model at
large flow rates. As the new model permits a trivial solution (vanishing
conformation tensor, vanishing polymer stress), an extension may be needed,
which includes Langevin noise in order to model thermal fluctuations.

<h3>Topological magnon-photon interaction for cavity magnonics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01349" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01349</a>
<br>
<i>Jongjun M. Lee, Myung-Joong Hwang, Hyun-Woo Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
The study of cavity magnonics and topological insulators has made significant
advances over the past decade, however the possibility of combining the two
fields is still unexplored. Here, we explore such connection by investigating
hybrid cavity systems that incorporate both a ferromagnet and a topological
insulator. We find that electrons in the topological surface state efficiently
mediate the effective electric dipole coupling between the spin of the
ferromagnet and the electric field of the cavity, in contrast with the
conventional cavity magnonics theory based on magnetic dipole coupling. We
refer to this coupling as topological magnon-photon interaction, estimating it
one order of magnitude stronger than the conventional magnon-photon coupling,
and showing that its sign can be manipulated. We discuss the potential of our
proposed device to allow for scaling down and controlling the cavity system
using electronics. Our results provide solid ground for exploring the
functionalities enabled by merging cavity magnonics with topological
insulators.

<h3>Ergodic inclusions in many body localized systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01350" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01350</a>
<br>
<i>Luis Colmenarez, David J. Luitz, Wojciech De Roeck</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of ergodic inclusions in putative many-body
localized systems. To this end, we consider the random field Heisenberg chain,
which is many-body localized at strong disorder and we couple it to an ergodic
bubble, modeled by a random matrix Hamiltonian. Recent theoretical work
suggests that the ergodic bubble destabilizes the apparent localized phase at
intermediate disorder strength and finite sizes. We tentatively confirm this by
numerically analyzing the response of the local thermality, quantified by
one-site purities, to the insertion of the bubble. For a range of intermediate
disorder strengths, this response decays very slowly, or not at all, with
increasing distance to the bubble. This suggests that at those disorder
strengths, the system is delocalized in the thermodynamic limit. However, the
numerics is unfortunately not unambiguous and we cannot definitely rule out
artefacts.

<h3>Absence of Weak Localization on Negative Curvature Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01351" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01351</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan B. Curtis, Prineha Narang, Victor Galitski</i>
<br>
<br>
The interplay between disorder and quantum interference leads to a wide
variety of physical phenomena including celebrated Anderson localization -- the
complete absence of diffusive transport due to quantum interference between
different particle trajectories. In two dimensions, any amount of disorder is
thought to induce localization of all states at long enough length scales,
though this may be prevented if bands are topological or have strong spin-orbit
coupling. In this note, we present a simple argument providing another
mechanism for disrupting localization: by tuning the underlying curvature of
the manifold on which diffusion takes place. We show that negative curvature
manifolds contain a natural infrared cut off for the probability of self
returning paths. We provide explicit calculations of the Cooperon -- directly
related to the weak-localization corrections to the conductivity -- in
hyperbolic space. It is shown that constant negative curvature leads to a rapid
growth in the number of available trajectories a particle can coherently
traverse in a given time, reducing the importance of interference effects and
restoring classical diffusive behavior even in the absence of inelastic
collisions. We conclude by arguing that this result may be amenable to
experimental verification through the use of quantum simulators.

<h3>Cometal addition effect on superconducting properties and granular  behaviours of polycrystalline FeSe0.5Te0.5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01367" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01367</a>
<br>
<i>Manasa Manasa, Mohammad Azam, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Ryszard Diduszko, Tomasz Cetner, Andrzej Morawski, Andrzej Wiśniewski, Shiv J. Singh</i>
<br>
<br>
The enhanced performance of superconducting FeSe0.5Te0.5 materials with added
microsized Pb and Sn particles is presented. A series of Pb and Sn added
FeSe0.5Te0.5 (FeSe0.5Te0.5 + xPb + ySn; x = y = 0-0.1) bulks are fabricated by
solid-state reaction method and characterized through various measurements. A
very small amount of Sn and Pb additions enhance the transition temperature
(Tconset) of pure FeSe0.5Te0.5 by 1 K, sharpening the superconducting
transition and improving the metallic nature in the normal state, whereas
larger metal additions reduce Tconset by broadening the superconducting
transition. Microstructural analysis and transport studies suggest that at
x=y>0.02, Pb and Sn additions enhance the impurity phases, reduce the coupling
between grains, and suppress the superconducting percolation, leading to a
broad transition. FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples with 2wt% of cometal additions show the
best performance with their critical current density, Jc, and the pinning
force, Fp, which might be attributable to providing effective flux pinning
centres. Our study shows that the inclusion of a relatively small amount of Pb
and Sn works effectively for the enhancement of superconducting properties with
an improvement of intergrain connections as well as better phase uniformity.

<h3>Design of origami structures with curved tiles between the creases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01387" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01387</a>
<br>
<i>Huan Liu, Richard D. James</i>
<br>
<br>
An efficient way to introduce elastic energy that can bias an origami
structure toward desired shapes is to allow curved tiles between the creases.
The bending of the tiles supplies the energy and the tiles themselves may have
additional functionality. In this paper, we present the theorem and systematic
design methods for quite general curved origami structures that can be folded
from a flat sheet, and we present methods to accurately find the stored elastic
energy. Here the tiles are allowed to undergo curved isometric mappings, and
the associated creases necessarily undergo isometric mappings as curves. These
assumptions are consistent with a variety of practical methods for crease
design. The h^3 scaling of the energy of thin sheets (h = thickness) spans a
broad energy range. Different tiles in an origami design can have different
values of h, and individual tiles can also have varying h. Following
developments for piecewise rigid origami, we develop further the Lagrangian
approach and the group orbit procedure in this context. We notice that some of
the simplest designs that arise from the group orbit procedure for certain
helical and conformal groups provide better matches to the buckling patterns
observed in compressed cylinders and cones than known patterns.

<h3>Quantum Classical Algorithm for the Study of Phase Transitions in the  Hubbard Model via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</h3>

Simulating quantum many-body systems is believed to be one of the most
promising applications of near-term noisy quantum computers. However, in the
near term, system size limitation will remain a severe barrier for applications
in materials science or strongly correlated systems. A promising avenue of
research is to combine many-body physics with machine learning for the
classification of distinct phases. In this paper, we propose a workflow that
synergizes quantum computing, many-body theory, and quantum machine
learning(QML) for studying strongly correlated systems. In particular, it can
capture a putative quantum phase transition of the stereotypical strongly
correlated system, the Hubbard model. Following the recent proposal of the
hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for the two-site dynamical mean-field
theory(DMFT), we present a modification that allows the self-consistent
solution of the single bath site DMFT. The modified algorithm can easily be
generalized for multiple bath sites. This approach is used to generate a
database of zero-temperature wavefunctions of the Hubbard model within the DMFT
approximation. We then use a QML algorithm to distinguish between the metallic
phase and the Mott insulator phase to capture the metal-to-Mott insulator phase
transition. We train a quantum convolutional neural network(QCNN) and then
utilize the QCNN as a quantum classifier to capture the phase transition
region. This work provides a recipe for application to other phase transitions
in strongly correlated systems and represents an exciting application of
small-scale quantum devices realizable with near-term technology.

<h3>Revival of antibiskyrmionic magnetic phases in bilayer NiI$_2$</h3>

Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures with potential
applications in memory and logic devices. Skyrmions have been commonly observed
in systems with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion
symmetry. Yet, recent studies suggest that skyrmions can also be stabilized in
systems with inversion symmetry such as Ni-based dihalides due to magnetic
frustration. In this article, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate
chiral magnetic phases in bilayers of NiI$_2$ and NiBr$_2$. We show that the
antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling introduces an additional magnetic
frustration and gives rise to a variety of novel spin textures with different
topological charges. Specifically for NiI$_2$, we observe that the skyrmions
with the in-plane component of spins wrapping around twice (biskyrmions) have
an enhanced stability compared to the monolayer case. We also study the
polarization induced by the non-colinear magnetic order in NiI$_2$ bilayers and
show that the polarization of the topologically nontrivial phases is negligible
compared to the spiral phases. Thus, we conclude that polarization measurements
can be an indirect route for detecting skyrmions in upcoming experiments.

<h3>Polarity of the fermionic condensation in the $p$-wave Kitaev model on a  square lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
In a $p$-wave Kitaev model, the nearest neighbor pairing term results in the
formation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pair in the ground state. In
this work, we study the fermionic condensation of real-space pairs in a $% p
$-wave Kitaev model on a square lattice with a uniform phase gradient pairing
term along both directions. The exact solution shows that the ground state can
be expressed in a coherent-state-like form, indicating the condensation of a
collective pairing mode, which is the superposition of different configurations
of pairs in real space. The amplitudes of each configuration depend not only on
the size but also on the orientation of the pair. We employ three quantities to
characterize the ground state in the thermodynamic limit. (i) A BCS-pair order
parameter is introduced to characterize the phase diagram, consisting of gapful
and topological gapless phases. (ii) The particle-particle correlation length
is obtained to reveal the polarity of the pair condensation. In addition, (iii)
a pair-pair correlator is analytically derived to indicate the possessing of
off-diagonal long-range order. Our work proposes an alternative method for
understanding fermionic condensation.

Elemental phosphorus exhibits fascinating structural varieties and versatile
properties. The unique nature of phosphorus bonds can lead to the formation of
extremely complex structures, and detailed structural information on some
phosphorus polymorphs is yet to be investigated. In this study, we investigated
an unidentified crystalline phase of phosphorus, type-II red phosphorus (RP),
by combining state-of-the-art structural characterization techniques. Electron
diffraction tomography, atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), powder X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were
concurrently used to elucidate the hidden structural motifs and their packing
in type-II RP. Electron diffraction tomography, performed using individual
crystalline nanowires, was used to identify a triclinic unit cell with volume
of 5330 {\AA}^3, the largest unit cell for elemental phosphorus crystals up to
now, which contains approximately 250 phosphorus atoms. Atomic-resolution STEM
imaging, which was performed along different crystal-zone axes, confirmed that
the twisted wavy tubular motif is the basic building block of type-II RP. Our
study discovered and presented a new variation of building blocks in
phosphorus, and it provides insights to clarify the complexities observed in
phosphorus as well as other relevant systems.

Recently, Sukbae Lee et al. reported inspiring experimental findings on the
atmospheric superconductivity of a modified lead apatite crystal (LK-99) at
room temperature (10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061, arXiv: 2307.12008, arXiv:
2307.12037). They claimed that the synthesized LK-99 materials exhibit the
Meissner levitation phenomenon of superconductors and have a superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) higher than 400 K. Here, for the first time, we
successfully verify and synthesize the LK-99 crystals which can be magnetically
levitated with larger levitated angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room
temperature. It is expected to realize the true potential of room temperature,
non-contact superconducting magnetic levitation in near future.

Disordered many-body systems exhibit a wide range of emergent phenomena
across different scales. These complex behaviors can be utilized for various
information processing tasks such as error correction, learning, and
optimization. Despite the empirical success of utilizing these systems for
intelligent tasks, the underlying principles that govern their emergent
intelligent behaviors remain largely unknown. In this thesis, we aim to
characterize such emergent intelligence in disordered systems through
statistical physics. We chart a roadmap for our efforts in this thesis based on
two axes: learning mechanisms (long-term memory vs. working memory) and
learning dynamics (artificial vs. natural). Throughout our journey, we uncover
relationships between learning mechanisms and physical dynamics that could
serve as guiding principles for designing intelligent systems. We hope that our
investigation into the emergent intelligence of seemingly disparate learning
systems can expand our current understanding of intelligence beyond neural
systems and uncover a wider range of computational substrates suitable for AI
applications.

We study computationally the dynamics of forced, Brownian particles through a
disordered system. As the concentration of mobile particles and/or fixed
obstacles increase, we characterize the different regimes of flow and address
how clogging develops. We show that clogging is preceded by a wide region of
anomalous transport, characterized by a power law decay of intermittent bursts.
We analyze the velocity distribution of the moving particles and show that this
abnormal flow region is characterized by a coexistence between mobile and
arrested particles, and their relative populations change smoothly as clogging
is approached. The comparison of the regimes of anomalous transport and
clogging with the corresponding scenarios of particles pushed through a single
bottleneck show qualitatively the same trends highlighting the generality of
the transport regimes leading to clogging.

<h3>Dimensionless parameter of structural ordering and excess entropy of  metallic and tellurite glasses</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using a notion on the excess entropy of glass with respect to the counterpart
crystal, we introduce a simple dimensionless order parameter $\xi$, which
changes from $\xi \rightarrow 0$ to $\xi \rightarrow 1$. The former case
corresponds to a strongly disordered liquid-like structure while the latter
situation describes a highly ordered crystal-like glass. This approach is
applied to 13 metallic and 2 tellurite glasses. We found that $\xi$ is strongly
sensitive to structural state and/or chemical composition. It can be also used
for a comparison of the order in glasses belonging to different classes and
appear to represent a new way of structural analysis.

<h3>High-throughput screening of Weyl semimetals</h3>

Topological Weyl semimetals represent a novel class of non-trivial materials,
where band crossings with linear dispersions take place at generic momenta
across reciprocal space. These crossings give rise to low-energy properties
akin to those of Weyl fermions, and are responsible for several exotic
phenomena. Up to this day, only a handful of Weyl semimetals have been
discovered, and the search for new ones remains a very active area. The main
challenge on the computational side arises from the fact that many of the tools
used to identify the topological class of a material do not provide a complete
picture in the case of Weyl semimetals. In this work, we propose an alternative
and inexpensive, criterion to screen for possible Weyl fermions, based on the
analysis of the band structure along high-symmetry directions in the absence of
spin-orbit coupling. We test the method by running a high-throughput screening
on a set of 5455 inorganic bulk materials and identify 49 possible candidates
for topological properties. A further analysis, carried out by identifying and
characterizing the crossings in the Brillouin zone, shows us that 3 of these
candidates are Weyl semimetals. Interestingly, while these 3 materials
underwent other high-throughput screenings, none had revealed their topological
behavior before.

Recent experiments have led to active colloidal molecules which aggregate
from non-motile building blocks and acquire self-propulsion through their
non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we model the collective behavior of such
active molecules and predict, besides dynamic clusters, the existence of a
so-far unknown state of active matter made of 'active fractalytes' which are
motile crystallites featuring internal holes, gaps and a fractal dimension.
These structures could serve as a starting point for the creation of active
materials with a low density and mechanical properties that can be designed
through their fractal internal structure.

<h3>DC Josephson effect between two Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states</h3>

<i>Subrata Chakraborty, Danilo Nikolić, Rubén Seoane Souto, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experiments [Nat. Phys. 16, 1227 (2020)] we present here
a theoretical study of the dc Josephson effect in a system comprising two
magnetic impurities coupled to their respective superconducting electrodes and
that exhibit Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. We make use of a mean-field
Anderson model with broken spin symmetry to compute the supercurrent in this
system for arbitrary range of parameters (coupling between the impurities,
orientation of the impurity spins, etc.). We predict a variety of physical
phenomena such as: (i) the occurrence of multiple $0$-$\pi$ transitions in the
regime of weak coupling that can be induced by changing the energy of the YSR
states or the temperature, (ii) the critical current strongly depends on the
relative orientation of the impurity spins and it is maximized when the spins
are either parallel or antiparallel, depending on the ground state of the
impurities, and (iii) upon increasing the coupling between impurities, triplet
superconductivity is generated in the system and it is manifested in a highly
non-sinusoidal current-phase relation. In principle, these predictions can be
tested experimentally with the existing realization of this system and the main
lessons of this Letter are of great relevance for the field of superconducting
spintronics.

<h3>Disorder Effects on the Quasiparticle and Transport Properties of  Two-Dimensional Dirac Fermionic Systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite extensive existing studies, a complete understanding of the role of
disorder in affecting the physical properties of two-dimensional Dirac
fermionic systems remains a standing challenge, largely due to obstacles
encountered in treating multiple scattering events for such inherently strong
scattering systems. Using graphene as an example and a nonperturbative
numerical technique, here we reveal that the low energy quasiparticle
properties are considerably modified by multiple scattering processes even in
the presence of weak scalar potentials. We extract unified power-law energy
dependences of the self-energy with fractional exponents from the weak
scattering limit to the strong scattering limit from our numerical analysis,
leading to sharp reductions of the quasiparticle residues near the Dirac point,
eventually vanishing at the Dirac point. The central findings stay valid when
the Anderson-type impurities are replaced by correlated Gaussian- or
Yukawa-type disorder with varying correlation lengths. The improved
understanding gained here also enables us to provide better interpretations of
the experimental observations surrounding the temperature and carrier density
dependences of the conductivity in ultra-high mobility graphene samples. The
approach demonstrated here is expected to find broad applicability in
understanding the role of various other types of impurities in two-dimensional
Dirac systems.

Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted considerable
attention due to their remarkable optical properties enabling robust room
temperature photonics and quantum optics applications in the visible spectral
range. On the other hand, identification of the microscopic origin of color
centers in hBN has turned out to be a great challenge that hinders in-depth
theoretical characterization, on-demand fabrication, and development of
integrated photonic devices. This is also true for the blue emitter, which is
an irradiation damage in hBN emitting at 436 nm wavelengths with desirable
properties. Here, we propose the negatively charged nitrogen split interstitial
defect in hBN as a plausible microscopic model for the blue emitter. To this
end, we carry out a comprehensive first principles theoretical study of the
nitrogen interstitial. We carefully analyze the accuracy of first principles
methods and show that the commonly used HSE hybrid exchange-correlation
functional fails to describe the electronic structure of this defect. Using the
generalized Koopman's theorem, we fine tune the functional and obtain a
zero-phonon photoluminescence (ZPL) energy in the blue spectral range. We show
that the defect exhibits high emission rate in the ZPL line and features a
characteristic phonon side band that resembles the blue emitter's spectrum.
Furthermore, we study the electric field dependence of the ZPL and numerically
show that the defect exhibits a quadratic Stark shift for perpendicular to
plane electric fields, making the emitter insensitive to electric field
fluctuations in first order. Our work emphasize the need for assessing the
accuracy of common first principles methods in hBN and exemplifies a workaround
methodology. Furthermore, our work is a step towards understanding the
structure of the blue emitter and utilizing it in photonics applications.

<h3>A general flux-Based Circuit Theory for Superconducting Josephson  Junction Circuits</h3>

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), single flux-quantum
(SFQ) logic circuits, and quantum Josephson junction circuits have been
developed into a family of superconductor integrated circuit, and are widely
applied for subtle magnetic-field measurements, energy-efficient computing, and
quantum computing, respectively. They are Josephson junction networks composed
of Josephson junctions and normal resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) components,
working with the fluxoid-quantization principle and Josephson effects to
achieve unique flux-modulated dynamics and characteristics; they react to the
vector potential of magnetic fields rather than the electric potential.
However, the conventional circuit diagrams and nodal analysis methods focus on
the electric charges flowing though branches and nodes, ignoring dynamics of
the magnetic fluxes flowing from loop to loop. This article introduces a
general flux-based circuit theory to unify the analyses of Josephson junction
circuits and normal RLC circuits. This theory presents a
magnetic-flux-generator (MFG) concept to unify Josephson junctions and normal

circuits as MFG network; it derives a general network equation to describe
dynamics of Josephson junction circuits, and invents a kind of magnetic-flux
flow (MFF) diagram to depict the working principles of magnetic-flux flows
inside Josephson junction circuits. The flux-based theory is complementary to
the conventional circuit theories in the design and analysis of superconductor
integrated circuits.

<h3>Flavor-wave theory with quasiparticle damping at finite temperatures:  Application to chiral edge modes in the Kitaev model</h3>

We propose a theoretical framework to investigate elementary excitations at
finite temperatures within a localized electron model that describes the
interactions between multiple degrees of freedom, such as quantum spin models
and Kugel-Khomskii models. Thus far, their excitation structures have been
mainly examined using the linear flavor-wave theory, an SU($N$) generalization
of the linear spin-wave theory. These techniques introduce noninteracting
bosonic quasiparticles as elementary excitations from the ground state, thereby
elucidating numerous physical phenomena, including excitation spectra and
transport properties characterized by topologically nontrivial band structures.
Nevertheless, the interactions between quasiparticles cannot be ignored in
systems exemplified by $S=1/2$ quantum spin models, where strong quantum
fluctuations are present. Recent studies have investigated the effects of
quasiparticle damping at zero temperature in such models. In our study,
extending this approach to the flavor-wave theory for general localized
electron models, we construct a comprehensive method to calculate excitation
spectra with the quasiparticle damping at finite temperatures. We apply our
method to the Kitaev model under magnetic fields, a typical example of models
with topologically nontrivial magnon bands. Our calculations reveal that chiral
edge modes undergo significant damping in weak magnetic fields, amplifying the
damping rate by the temperature increase. This effect is caused by collisions
with thermally excited quasiparticles. Since our approach starts from a general
Hamiltonian, it will be widely applicable to other localized systems, such as
spin-orbital coupled systems derived from multi-orbital Hubbard models in the
strong correlation limit.

Recent works on electric bubbles (including the experimental demonstration of
electric skyrmions) constitute a breakthrough akin to the discovery of magnetic
skyrmions some 15 years ago. So far research has focused on obtaining and
visualizing these objects, which often appear to be immobile (pinned) in
experiments. Thus, critical aspects of magnetic skyrmions - e.g., their
quasiparticle nature, Brownian motion - remain unexplored (unproven) for
electric bubbles. Here we use predictive atomistic simulations to investigate
the basic dynamical properties of these objects in pinning-free model systems.
We show that it is possible to find regimes where the electric bubbles can
present long lifetimes ($\sim$ ns) despite being relatively small ($\varnothing
<$ 2 nm). Additionally, we find that they can display stochastic dynamics with
large and highly tunable diffusion constants. We thus establish the
quasiparticle nature of electric bubbles and put them forward for the physical
effects and applications (e.g., in token-based Probabilistic Computing)
considered for magnetic skyrmions.

Electrically-driven spin resonance is a powerful technique for controlling
semiconductor spin qubits. However, it faces challenges in qubit addressability
and off-resonance driving in larger systems. We demonstrate coherent
bichromatic Rabi control of quantum dot hole spin qubits, offering a
spatially-selective approach for large qubit arrays. By applying simultaneous
microwave bursts to different gate electrodes, we observe multichromatic
resonance lines and resonance anticrossings that are caused by the ac Stark
shift. Our theoretical framework aligns with experimental data, highlighting
interdot motion as the dominant mechanism for bichromatic driving.

<h3>Dense Random Packing of Disks With a Power-Law Size Distribution in  Thermodynamic Limit: Fractal-like Properties</h3>

The correlation properties of a dense random system of disks with a power-law
size distribution are analyzed in momentum space in the thermodynamic limit.
The limit assumes that the total number the disks increases infinitely, while
the mean density of the disk centers and the range of the size distribution are
kept constant. The structure factor dependence on momentum transfer is
investigated for various numbers of disks and extrapolated to the thermodynamic
limit. The fractal power-law decay of the structure factor is recovered in
momentum space within the fractal range, which corresponds to the range of the
size distribution in real space. The fractal exponent coincides with the
exponent of the power-law size distribution as was shown previously by the
authors [Cherny, Anitas, Osipov, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (4), 044114 (2023)]. The
finite-size effects are also studied at very small momentum of order of the
inverse system size. We show that the structure factor is parabolic in this
region and calculate the prefactor analytically. The obtained results reveal
fractal-like properties of the packing. Our findings can be used to analyze
small-angle scattering from such systems.

<h3>Energy spectrum of valence band in HgTe quantum wells on the way from a  two to the three dimensional topological insulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetic field, temperature dependence and the Hall effect have been
measured in order to determine the energy spectrum of the valence band in HgTe
quantum wells with the width (20-200)nm. The comparison of hole densities
determined from the period Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and the Hall effect
shows that states at the top of valence band are double degenerate in teh entry
quantum wells width the width range. The cyclotron mass determined from
temperature dependence of SdH oscillations increases monotonically from
(0.2-0.3) mass of the free electron, with increasing hole density from 2e11 to
6e11 cm^-2. The determined dependence has been compared to theoretical one
calculate within the four band kp model. The experimental dependence was found
to be strongly inconsistent with this predictions. It has been shown that the
inclusion of additional factors (electric field, strain) does not remove the
contradiction between experiment and theory. Consequently it is doubtful that
the mentioned kp calculations adequately describe the valence band for any
width of quantum well.

<h3>Random spin textures in turbulent spinor Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>

We numerically investigate the stationary turbulent states of spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensates under continuous spin driving. We analyze the
entanglement entropy and magnetization correlation function to demonstrate the
isotropic nature of the intricate spin texture that is generated in the
nonequilibrium steady state. We observe a $-7/3$ power-law behavior in the
spin-dependent interaction energy spectrum. To gain further insight into the
statistical properties of the spin texture, we introduce a spin state ensemble
obtained through position projection, revealing its close resemblance to the
Haar random ensemble for spin-1 systems. We also present the probability
distribution of the spin vector magnitude in the turbulent condensate, which
can be tested in experiments. Our numerical study highlights the
characteristics of stationary turbulence in the spinor BEC system and confirms
previous experimental findings by Hong et al. [Phys. Rev. A 108, 013318
(2023)].

While ostensibly coined in 1989 by Xiao-Gang Wen, the term "topological
order" has been in use since 1972 by Kosterlitz-Thouless to describe the
behavior of the classical xy model. It has been noted that the xy model does
not have Wen's topological order since it is also subject a non-topological
U(1) gauge action. We show in a sense this is the only obstruction. That is, if
the xy model evolves quantumly into gauge invariant states then one recovers
pure topological order. In fact, we show the quantum xy topological order is an
infinite lattice limit of Kitaev's quantum double model applied to the group
G=Z.

Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) are interesting because of the
interplay between the electronic and magnetic subsystems. We describe selected
magnetic properties of IV-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors, looking at the
similarities and differences between magnetic properties of II-VI, IV-VI, and
III-V DMS. We focus on the influence of the crystalline and electronic
structure of the material on its magnetic properties, especially on the
exchange interactions among magnetic ions. We describe methods of determination
of the exchange parameters by using different experimental techniques, such as
measurements of magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat. We
follow the development in the material technology from bulk crystals to thin
films and nanostructures.

<h3>Unique properties of the optical activity in noncentrosymmetric  superconductors: sum rule, missing area, and relation with the  superconducting Edelstein effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01786" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01786</a>
<br>
<i>Koki Shinada, Robert Peters</i>
<br>
<br>
We present general properties of the optical activity in noncentrosymmetric
materials, including superconductors. We derive a sum rule of the optical
activity in general electric states and show that the summation of the spectrum
is zero, which is independent of the details of electric states. The optical
activity has a $\delta$-function singularity that vanishes in normal phases.
However, the singularity emerges in superconducting phases, corresponding to
the Meissner effect in the optical conductivity. The spectrum decreases by the
superconducting gap and has a missing area compared to the normal phase. This
area is exactly equivalent to the coefficient of the $\delta$-function
singularity due to the universal sum rule. Furthermore, the coefficient is
exactly equivalent to the superconducting Edelstein effect, which has not yet
been observed in experiments. Thus, this measurement of the missing area offers
an alternative way to observe the superconducting Edelstein effect.

<h3>Glass-like Caging with Random Planes</h3>

<i>Giampaolo Folena, Patrick Charbonneau</i>
<br>
<br>
The richness of the mean-field solution of simple glasses leaves many of its
features challenging to interpret. A minimal model that illuminates glass
physics the same way the random energy model clarifies spin glass behavior
would therefore be beneficial. Here, we propose such a real-space model that is
amenable to infinite-dimensional analysis and is exactly solvable at high and
low densities in finite dimension. By joining analysis with numerical
simulations, we uncover geometrical signatures of the dynamical and jamming
transitions and provides insight into the origin of activated processes.
Translating these findings to the context of standard glass formers further
reveals the role played by non-convexity in the emergence of Gardner physics.

<h3>Solving Conformal Defects in 3D Conformal Field Theory using Fuzzy  Sphere Regularization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01903</a>

<br>
<br>
Defects in conformal field theory (CFT) are of significant theoretical and
experimental importance. The presence of defects theoretically enriches the
structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to
study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the
recently-developed theoretical scheme, fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere
regularization, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the
defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the
magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a
conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary
operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their
scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also
compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which
show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from
which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients.
Our work demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere offers a powerful tool for
exploring the rich physics in 3D defect CFTs.
