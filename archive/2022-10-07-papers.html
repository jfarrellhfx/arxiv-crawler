<h3>Non-perturbative constraints from symmetry and chirality on Majorana  zero modes and defect quantum numbers in (2+1)D</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02452" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02452</a>
<br>
<i>Naren Manjunath, Vladimir Calvera, Maissam Barkeshli</i>
<br>
In (1+1)D topological phases, unpaired Majorana zero modes (MZMs) can arise
only if the internal symmetry group $G_f$ of the ground state splits as $G_f =
G_b \times \mathbb{Z}_2^f$, where $\mathbb{Z}_2^f$ is generated by fermion
parity, $(-1)^F$. In contrast, (2+1)D topological superconductors (TSC) can
host unpaired MZMs at defects even when $G_f$ is not of the form $G_b \times
\mathbb{Z}_2^f$. In this paper we study how $G_f$ together with the chiral
central charge $c_-$ strongly constrain the existence of unpaired MZMs and the
quantum numbers of symmetry defects. Our results utilize a recent algebraic
characterization of (2+1)D invertible fermionic topological states, which
provides a non-perturbative approach based on topological quantum field theory,
beyond free fermions. We study physically relevant groups such as
$\mathrm{U}(1)^f\rtimes H,\mathrm{SU}(2)^f \times H, \mathrm{U}(2)^f\rtimes H
$, generic Abelian groups, as well as more general compact Lie groups,
antiunitary symmetries and crystalline symmetries. We present an algebraic
formula for the fermionic crystalline equivalence principle, which gives an
equivalence between states with crystalline and internal symmetries. In light
of our theory, we discuss several previously proposed realizations of unpaired
MZMs in TSC materials such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, transition metal dichalcogenides
and iron superconductors, in which crystalline symmetries are often important;
in some cases we present additional predictions for the properties of these
models.

<h3>Scattering theory of delicate topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02459</a>
<br>
<i>Penghao Zhu, Jiho Noh, Yingkai Liu, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<br>
We study the scattering theory of delicate topological insulators (TIs),
which are novel topological phases beyond the paradigm of the tenfold way,
topological quantum chemistry, and the symmetry indicator method. We
demonstrate that the phase of the reflection amplitude can probe the delicate
topology by capturing a characteristic feature of a delicate TI. This feature
is the returning Thouless pump, where an integer number of charges are pumped
forward and backward in the first and second half of the adiabatic cycle
respectively. As a byproduct of our analysis we show that requiring additional
symmetries can stable the boundary states of a delicate TI beyond the
conventional requirement of a sharply defined surface. Furthermore, we propose
a photonic crystal experiment to implement a delicate TI and measure its
reflection phase which reveals the delicate topology.

<h3>Exact solution for the filling-induced thermalization transition in a 1D  fracton system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02469" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02469</a>
<br>
<i>Calvin Pozderac, Steven Speck, Xiaozhou Feng, David A. Huse, Brian Skinner</i>
<br>
We study a random circuit model of constrained fracton dynamics, in which
particles on a one-dimensional lattice undergo random local motion subject to
both charge and dipole moment conservation. The configuration space of this
system exhibits a continuous phase transition between a weakly fragmented
("thermalizing") phase and a strongly fragmented ("nonthermalizing") phase as a
function of the number density of particles. Here, by mapping to two different
problems in combinatorics, we identify an exact solution for the critical
density $n_c$. Specifically, when evolution proceeds by operators that act on
$\ell$ contiguous sites, the critical density is given by $n_c = 1/(\ell -2)$.
We identify the critical scaling near the transition, and we show that there is
a universal value of the correlation length exponent $\nu = 2$. We confirm our
theoretical results with numeric simulations. In the thermalizing phase the
dynamical exponent is subdiffusive: $z=4$, while at the critical point it
increases to $z_c \gtrsim 6$.

<h3>Dipole condensates in tilted Bose-Hubbard chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02470</a>
<br>
<i>Ethan Lake, Hyun-Yong Lee, Jung Hoon Han, T. Senthil</i>
<br>
We study the quantum phase diagram of a Bose-Hubbard chain whose dynamics
conserves both boson number and boson dipole moment, a situation which can
arise in strongly tilted optical lattices. The conservation of dipole moment
has a dramatic effect on the phase diagram, which we analyze by combining a
field theory analysis with DMRG simulations. Unlike the conventional
Bose-Hubbard model, the phase diagram contains no compressible phases, and is
instead dominated by various types of exotic dipolar condensates. We suggest
several ways by which these condensates can be identified in near-term cold
atom experiments.

<h3>Emergence of quasiperiodic behaviour in transport and hybridisation  properties of clean lattice systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02480</a>
<br>
<i>Cecilie Glittum, Antonio Štrkalj, Claudio Castelnovo</i>
<br>
Quasiperiodic behaviour is known to occur in systems with enforced
quasiperiodicity or randomness, in either the lattice structure or the
potential, as well as in periodically driven systems. Here, we present instead
a setting where quasiperiodic behaviour emerges in clean, non-driven lattice
systems. We illustrate this through two examples of experimental relevance,
namely an infinite tight-binding chain with a gated segment, and a hopping
particle coupled to static Ising degrees of freedom. We show how the
quasiperiodic behaviour manifests in the number of states that are localised by
the geometry of the system, with corresponding effects on transport and
hybridisation properties.

<h3>Topological invariants for SPT entanglers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02485</a>
<br>
<i>Carolyn Zhang</i>
<br>
We develop a framework for classifying locality preserving unitaries (LPUs)
with internal, unitary symmetries in $d$ dimensions, based on $(d-1)$
dimensional ``flux insertion operators" which are easily computed from the
unitary. Using this framework, we obtain formulas for topological invariants of
LPUs that prepare, or entangle, symmetry protected topological phases (SPTs).
These formulas serve as edge invariants for Floquet topological phases in
$(d+1)$ dimensions that ``pump" $d$-dimensional SPTs. For 1D SPT entanglers and
certain higher dimensional SPT entanglers, our formulas are completely
closed-form.

<h3>Tuning light emission crossovers in atomic-scale aluminum plasmonic  tunnel junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02486</a>
<br>
<i>Yunxuan Zhu, Longji Cui, Mahdiyeh Abbasi, Douglas Natelson</i>
<br>
Atomic sized plasmonic tunnel junctions are of fundamental interest, with
great promise as the smallest on-chip light sources in various optoelectronic
applications. Several mechanisms of light emission in electrically driven
plasmonic tunnel junctions have been proposed, from single-electron or higher
order multi-electron inelastic tunneling to recombination from a steady-state
population of hot carriers. By progressively altering the tunneling conductance
of an aluminum junction, we tune the dominant light emission mechanism through
these possibilities for the first time, finding quantitative agreement with
theory in each regime. Improved plasmonic resonances in the energy range of
interest increase photon yields by two orders of magnitude. These results
demonstrate that the dominant emission mechanism is set by a combination of
tunneling rate, hot carrier relaxation timescales, and junction plasmonic
properties.

<h3>Fractional Statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02530" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02530</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Greiter, Frank Wilczek</i>
<br>
The quantum-mechanical description of assemblies of particles whose motion is
confined to two (or one) spatial dimensions offers many possibilities that are
distinct from bosons and fermions. We call such particles anyons. The simplest
anyons are parameterized by an angular phase parameter $\theta$. $\theta = 0,
\pi$ correspond to bosons and fermions respectively; at intermediate values we
say that we have fractional statistics. In two dimensions, $\theta$ describes
the phase acquired by the wave function as two anyons wind around one another
counterclockwise. It generates a shift in the allowed values for the relative
angular momentum. Composites of localized electric charge and magnetic flux
associated with an abelian U(1) gauge group realize this behavior. More complex
charge-flux constructions can involve non-abelian and product groups acting on
a spectrum of allowed charges and fluxes, giving rise to nonabelian and mutual
statistics. Interchanges of non-abelian anyons implement unitary
transformations of the wave function within an emergent space of internal
states. Anyons of all kinds are described by quantum field theories that
include Chern--Simons terms. The crossings of one-dimensional anyons on a ring
are uni-directional, such that a fractional phase $\theta$ acquired upon
interchange gives rise to fractional shifts in the relative momenta between the
anyons. The quasiparticle excitations of fractional quantum Hall states have
long been predicted to include anyons. Recently the anyon behavior predicted
for quasiparticles in the $\nu = 1/3$ fractional quantum Hall state has been
observed both in scattering and in interferometric experiments. Excitations
within designed systems, notably including superconducting circuits, can
exhibit anyon behavior. Such systems are being developed for possible use in
quantum information processing.

<h3>A roadmap for edge computing enabled automated multidimensional  transmission electron microscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02538</a>
<br>
<i>Debangshu Mukherjee, Kevin M. Roccapriore, Anees Al-Najjar, Ayana Ghosh, Jacob D. Hinkle, Andrew R. Lupini, Rama K. Vasudevan, Sergei V. Kalinin, Olga S. Ovchinnikova, Maxim A. Ziatdinov, Nageswara S. Rao</i>
<br>
The advent of modern, high-speed electron detectors has made the collection
of multidimensional hyperspectral transmission electron microscopy datasets,
such as 4D-STEM, a routine. However, many microscopists find such experiments
daunting since such datasets' analysis, collection, long-term storage, and
networking remain challenging. Some common issues are the large and unwieldy
size of the said datasets, often running into several gigabytes,
non-standardized data analysis routines, and a lack of clarity about the
computing and network resources needed to utilize the electron microscope
fully. However, the existing computing and networking bottlenecks introduce
significant penalties in each step of these experiments, and thus, real-time
analysis-driven automated experimentation for multidimensional TEM is
exceptionally challenging. One solution is integrating microscopy with edge
computing, where moderately powerful computational hardware performs the
preliminary analysis before handing off the heavier computation to HPC systems.
In this perspective, we trace the roots of computation in modern electron
microscopy, demonstrate deep learning experiments running on an edge system,
and discuss the networking requirements for tying together microscopes, edge
computers, and HPC systems.

<h3>Photocurrent and photoacoustic detection of plasmonic behavior of CdSe  quantum dots grown in Au nanogaps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02542</a>
<br>
<i>Andriy Nadtochiy, Om Krishna Suwal, Dai-Sik Kim, Oleg Korotchenkov</i>
<br>
In this work, the influence of Au plasmonics on photocurrent generation in
the visible wavelength range in integrated thiol-linked CdSe quantum dot/Au
nanogap structures is demonstrated. The plasmonic absorption is sensed
utilizing photoacoustic (PA) detection technique. The laser diode is modulated
to generate the PA excitation that oscillates the air-filled cell. When light
absorption increases, an enhanced acoustic signal is captured by a microphone.
The observed enhancement in the PA response is related to plasmonic absorption
by the Au layers and the response is further enhanced by about 20% due to CdSe
QDs. In our structure, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength is
approximately 500 nm. The SPR is utilized for generating photocurrents in CdSe
quantum dots. Due to energy transfer from the dot to closely spaced Au surface
through thiol links, a smooth transmission channel of electrons is established
that forms a detectable photocurrent, which can be tuned by a bias voltage.
These plasmonic nanogap structures can enable higher sensitivity in
photovoltaics, photodetection and sensing.

<h3>Controlled Ordering of Room-Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions in a Polar  Van der Waals Magnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02546</a>
<br>
<i>Peter Meisenheimer, Hongrui Zhang, David Raftrey, Xiang Chen, Ying-Ting Chan, Rui Chen, Reed Yalisove, Mary C. Scott, Jie Yao, Weida Wu, Peter Fischer, Robert J. Birgeneau, Ramamoorthy Ramesh</i>
<br>
Control and understanding of ensembles of skyrmions is important for
realization of future technologies. In particular, the order-disorder
transition associated with the 2D lattice of magnetic skyrmions can have
significant implications for transport and other dynamic functionalities. To
date, skyrmion ensembles have been primarily studied in bulk crystals, or as
isolated skyrmions in thin film devices. Here, we investigate the condensation
of the skyrmion phase at room temperature and zero field in a polar, Van der
Waals magnet. We demonstrate that we can engineer an ordered skyrmion crystal
through structural confinement on the $\mu$m scale, showing control over this
order-disorder transition on scales relevant for device applications.

<h3>Scalability of Superconductor Electronics: Limitations Imposed by AC  Clock and Flux Bias Transformers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02632</a>
<br>
<i>Sergey K. Tolpygo</i>
<br>
Flux transformers are the necessary component of all superconductor digital
integrated circuits utilizing ac power for logic cell excitation and clocking,
and flux biasing, e.g., Adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (AQFP), Reciprocal
Quantum Logic, superconducting sensor arrays, qubits, etc. We consider
limitations to the integration scale (device number density) imposed by the
critical current of the ac power transmission lines and cross coupling between
the adjacent transformers. The former sets the minimum line width and the
mutual coupling length in the transformer, whereas the latter sets the minimum
spacing between the transformers. Decreasing linewidth of superconducting (Nb)
wires increases kinetic inductance of the transformer's secondary, decreasing
its length and mutual coupling to the primary. This limits the minimum size of
transformers. As a result, there is a minimum linewidth ~100 nm which
determines the maximum achievable scale of integration. Using AQFP circuits as
an example, we calculate dependence of the AQFP number density on linewidth for
various types of transformers and inductors available in the SFQ5ee fabrication
process developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and estimate the maximum circuit
density as a few million AQFPs per cm^2. We propose an advanced fabrication
process for a 10x increase in the density of AQFP and other ac-powered
circuits. In this process, inductors are formed from a patterned bilayer of a
geometrical inductance material (Nb) deposited over a layer of high kinetic
inductance material (e.g., NbN). Individual pattering of the bilayer layers
allows to create stripline inductors in a wide range of inductances, from the
low values typical to Nb striplines to the high values typical for NbN thin
films, and preserve sufficient mutual coupling in stripline transformers with
extremely low crosstalk.

<h3>Non-Reciprocal Supercurrents in a Field-Free Graphene Josephson Triode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02644" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02644</a>
<br>
<i>John Chiles, Ethan G. Arnault, Chun-Chia Chen, Trevyn F.Q. Larson, Lingfei Zhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, François Amet, Gleb Finkelstein</i>
<br>
Superconducting diodes are proposed non-reciprocal circuit elements that
should exhibit non-dissipative transport in one direction while being resistive
in the opposite direction. Multiple examples of such devices have emerged in
the past couple of years, however their efficiency is typically limited, and
most of them require magnetic field to function. Here we present a device
achieving efficiencies upwards of 90% while operating at zero field. Our
samples consist of a network of three graphene Josephson junctions linked by a
common superconducting island, to which we refer as a Josephson triode. The
triode is tuned by applying a control current to one of the contacts, thereby
breaking the time-reversal symmetry of the current flow. The triode's utility
is demonstrated by rectifying a small (tens of nA amplitude) applied square
wave. We speculate that devices of this type could be realistically employed in
the modern quantum circuits.

<h3>An intermediate phase induced by dilution in a correlated Dirac Fermi  system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02662</a>
<br>
<i>Lingyu Tian, Jingyao Meng, Tianxing Ma</i>
<br>
Substituting magnetic ions with nonmagnetic ions is a new way to study
dilution. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we investigate an
interacting Dirac fermion model with the on-site Coulomb repulsion being
randomly zero on a fraction $x$ of sites. Based on conductivity, density of
states and antiferromagnetic structure factor, our results reveal a novel
intermediate insulating phase induced by the competition between dilution and
repulsion. With increasing doping level of nonmagnetic ions, this nonmagnetic
intermediate phase is found to emerge from the zero-temperature quantum
critical point separating a metallic and a Mott insulating phase, whose
robustness is proven over a wide range of interactions. Under the premise of
strongly correlated materials, we suggest that doping nonmagnetic ions can
effectively convert the system back to the paramagnetic metallic phase. This
result not only agrees with experiments on the effect of dilution on magnetic
order but also provides a possible direction for studies focusing on the
metal-insulator transition in honeycomb lattice like materials.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has drawn significant attention for its near room
temperature insulator to metal transition and associated structural phase
transition. The underlying Physics behind the temperature induced insulator to
metal and concomitant structural phase transition in VO2 is yet to be fully
understood. We have investigated the kinetics of the above phase transition
behaviors of VO2 with the help of resistivity measurements and Raman
spectroscopy. Resistance thermal hysteresis scaling and relaxation measurements
across the temperature induced insulator to metal transition reveal the unusual
behaviour of this first-order phase transition, whereas Raman relaxation
measurements show that the temperature induced structural phase transition in
VO2 follows usual behaviour and is consistent with mean field prediction. At
higher temperature sweeping rates decoupling of insulator to metal transition
and structural phase transition have been confirmed. The observed anomalous
first order phase transition behavior in VO2 is attributed to the
unconventional quasi particle dynamics, i.e. significantly lowered electronic
thermal conductivity across insulator to metal transition, which is confirmed
by ultrafast optical pump-probe time domain thermoreflectance measurements.

We study Wigner crystallization of electron systems in phosphorene quantum
dots with confinement of an electrostatic origin with both circular and
elongated geometry. The anisotropy of the effective mass allows for the
formation of Wigner molecules in the laboratory frame with a confined charge
density that has lower symmetry than the confinement potential. We find that in
circular quantum dots separate single-electron islands are formed for two and
four confined electrons but not for three trapped carriers. The spectral
signatures of the Wigner crystallization to be resolved by transport
spectroscopy are discussed. Systems with Wigner molecule states are
characterized by a nearly degenerate ground state at $B=0$ and are easily
spin-polarized by the external magnetic field. In electron systems for which
the single-electron islands are not formed, a more even distribution of excited
states at $B=0$ is observed, and the confined system undergoes ground state
symmetry transitions at magnetic fields of the order of 1 Tesla. The system of
five electrons in a circular quantum dot is indicated as a special case with
two charge configurations that appear in the ground-state as the magnetic field
is changed: one with the single electron islands formed in the laboratory frame
and the other where only the pair-correlation function in the inner coordinates
of the system has a molecular form as for three electrons. The formation of
Wigner molecules of quasi-1D form is easier for the orientation of elongated
quantum dots along the zigzag direction with heavier electron mass. The smaller
electron effective mass along the armchair direction allows for freezing out
the transverse degree of freedom in the electron motion.

<h3>Capture of a diffusing lamb by a diffusing lion when both return home</h3>

<br>
A diffusing lion pursues a diffusing lamb when both of them are allowed to
get back to their homes intermittently. Identifying the system with a pair of
vicious random walkers, we study their dynamics under Poissonian and sharp
resetting. In absence of any resets, the location of intersection of the two
walkers follows a Cauchy distribution. In presence of resetting, the
distribution of the location of annihilation is composed of two parts: one in
which the trajectories cross without being reset (center) and the other where
trajectories are reset at least once before they cross each other (tails). We
find that the tail part decays exponentially for both the resetting protocols.
The central part of the distribution, on the other hand, depends on the nature
of the restart protocol, with Cauchy for Poisson resetting and Gaussian for
sharp resetting. We find good agreement of the analytical results with
numerical calculations.

In a bridge configuration, a single graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is positioned
with a picometer precision over a trench in between two monoatomic steps on an
Au(111) surface. This GNR molecular wire adopts a deformed conformation towards
the down terrace in between the two contact step edges. Using differential
conductance dI/dV mapping from a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope,
it is demonstrated how the electronic delocalization along GNR is cut at each
contact by its down curvature. It points out the need to bring conductive
nanocontacts backside of the support for preserving the front side GNR planar
conformation.

<br>

<br>
For quicker formation of ice, before inserting inside a refrigerator, heating
up of a body of water can be beneficial. We report first observation of a
counterpart of this intriguing fact, referred to as the Mpemba effect (ME),
during ordering in ferromagnets. By performing Monte Carlo simulations of a
generic model, we have obtained results on relaxation of systems that are
quenched to sub-critical state points from various temperatures above the
critical point. For a fixed final temperature, a system with higher starting
temperature equilibrates faster than the one prepared at a lower temperature,
implying the presence of ME. The observation is extremely counter-intuitive,
particularly because of the fact that the model has no in-built frustration or
metastability that typically is thought to provide ME. Via the calculations of
nonequilibrium properties concerning structure and energy, we quantify the role
of critical fluctuations behind this fundamental as well as technologically
relevant observation.

Three-dimensional higher-order topological insulators can have topologically
protected chiral modes propagating on their hinges. Hinges with two
co-propagating chiral modes can serve as a "beam splitter" between hinges with
only a single chiral mode. Here we show how such a crystal, with Ohmic contacts
attached to its hinges, can be used to realize a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
We present concrete calculations for a lattice model of a first-order
topological insulator in a magnetic field, which, for a suitable choice of
parameters, is an extrinsic second-order topological insulator with the
required configuration of chiral hinge modes.

<br>
The magnetic structure of antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-Mn has been unclarified
for almost 70 years since its magnetism was discovered. We measured the
zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-Mn
to obtain further insight into magnetism below $T_{\text{N}} = 95$ K. The site
II spectra split into two sites with five subpeaks owing to quadrupole
interaction, and this shows that the ordered moments at site II are slightly
tilted from the $[001]$ direction. The site III spectra revealed that this site
splits into four sites below $T_{\text{N}}$. These findings clearly demonstrate
that the antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-Mn symmetry is lower than previously
considered.

<h3>How are mobility and friction related in viscoelastic fluids?</h3>

<br>

<br>
The motion of a colloidal probe in a viscoelastic fluid is described by
friction or mobility, depending on whether the probe is moving with a velocity
or feeling a force. While the Einstein relation describes an inverse
relationship valid for Newtonian solvents, both concepts are generalized to
time-dependent memory kernels in viscoelastic fluids. We theoretically and
experimentally investigate their relation by considering two observables: the
recoil after releasing a probe that was moved through the fluid and the
equilibrium mean squared displacement (MSD). Applying concepts of linear
response theory, we generalize Einstein's relation and thereby relate recoil
and MSD, which both provide access to the mobility kernel. With increasing
concentration, however, MSD and recoil show distinct behaviors, rooted in
different behaviors of the two kernels. Using two theoretical models, a linear
two-bath particle model and hard spheres treated by mode-coupling theory, we
find a Volterra relation between the two kernels, explaining differing
timescales in friction and mobility kernels under variation of concentration.

<h3>Direct probing of a large spin-orbit coupling in the FeSe  superconducting monolayer on STO: Evidence for nontrivial topological states</h3>

<br>
In condensed-matter physics spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a fundamental
physical interaction, which describes how the electrons' spin couples to their
orbital motion. It is the source of a vast variety of fascinating phenomena in
solids such as topological phases of matter, quantum spin Hall states, and many
other exotic quantum states. Although in most theoretical descriptions of the
phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity SOC has been neglected,
including this interaction can, in principle, revise the microscopic picture of
superconductivity in these compounds. Not only the interaction leading to
Cooper pairing but also the symmetry of the order parameter and the topological
character of the involved states can be determined by SOC. Here by preforming
energy-, momentum-, and spin-resolved spectroscopy experiments with an
unprecedented resolution we demonstrate that while probing the dynamic charge
response of the FeSe monolayer on strontium titanate, a prototype two
dimensional high-temperature superconductor using slow electrons, the
scattering cross-section shows a considerable spin asymmetry. We unravel the
origin of the observed spin asymmetry by developing a model in which SOC is
taken into consideration. Our analysis indicates that SOC in this two
dimensional superconductor is rather strong. We anticipate that such a strong
SOC can have several serious consequences on the electronic structures and can
lead to the formation of topological states. Moreover, a sizable SOC can
compete with other pairing scenarios and is crucial for the mechanism of
high-temperature superconductivity.

<h3>Phonon-limited carrier mobilities and Hall factors in 4H-SiC from first  principles</h3>

<br>
<i>Tianqi Deng, Deren Yang, Xiaodong Pi</i>
<br>
Charge carrier mobility is at the core of semiconductor materials and devices
optimization, and Hall measurement is one of the most important techniques for
its characterization. The Hall factor, defined as the ratio between Hall and
drift mobilities, is of particular importance. Here we study the effect of
anisotropy by computing the drift and Hall mobility tensors of a
technologically important wide-band-gap semiconductor, 4H-silicon carbide
(4H-SiC) from first principles. With $GW$ electronic structure and \textit{ab
initio} electron-phonon interactions, we solve the Boltzmann transport equation
without fitting parameters. The calculated electron and hole mobilities agree
with experimental data. The electron Hall factor strongly depends on the
direction of external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, and the hole Hall factor
exhibits different temperature dependency for $\mathbf{B}\parallel c$ and
$\mathbf{B}\perp c$. We explain this by the different equienergy surface shape
arising from the anisotropic and non-parabolic band structure, together with
the energy-dependent electron-phonon scattering.

<h3>First-principles study of structural disorder, site preference, chemical  bonding and transport properties of Mg-doped tetrahedrite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02838</a>
<br>
<i>Krzysztof Kapera, Andrzej Kolezynski</i>
<br>
Tetrahedrite-based ($\textrm{Cu}_{12}\textrm{Sb}_{4}\textrm{S}_{13}$)
materials are candidates for good thermoelectric generators due to their
intrinsic, very low thermal conductivity and high power factor. One of the
current limitations is virtual absence of tetrahedrites exhibiting n--type
conductivity. In this work, first-principles calculations are carried out to
study Mg-doped tetrahedrite,
$\textrm{Mg}_{x}\textrm{Cu}_{12}\textrm{Sb}_{4}\textrm{S}_{13}$ with
possibility of predicting n--type material in mind. Different concentrations
and modifications of the structure are investigated for their formation
energies, preferred site occupation and change in local environment around
dopants. Mg atoms tend to occupy 6b site, while introduced excess Cu prefers
24g site. Introduction of elements in those sites display different effect on
nearby rattling Cu(2) atom. Topological analysis shows that tetrahedrite
exhibits ionic, closed-shell bonds with some degree of covalency. Majority of
the bonds weakens with increasing content of Mg; structure becomes increasingly
less stable, which is also expressed by global instability and bond strain
indexes. Achieving n--type conductivity was predicted by the calculations for
structures with $x>1.0$, however increasing enthalpy of formation and lack of
stability might suggest limit of solubility and difficulties in obtaining those
experimentally.

<h3>Current-induced enhancement of photo-response in graphene THz radiation  detectors</h3>

<br>
<i>K. Indykiewicz, C. Bray, C. Consejo, F. Teppe, S. Danilov, S.D. Ganichev, A. Yurgens</i>
<br>
Thermoelectric readout in a graphene THz radiation detector requires a p-n
junction across the graphene channel. Even without an intentional p-n junction,
two latent junctions can exist in the vicinity of the electrodes/antennas
through the proximity to metal. In a symmetrical structure, these junctions are
connected back-to-back and therefore counterbalance each other with regard to
rectification of the ac signal. Because of the Peltier effect, a small dc
current results in additional heating in one- and cooling in another p-n
junction, thereby breaking the symmetry. The p-n junctions then no longer
cancel, resulting in a greatly enhanced rectified signal. This allows to
simplify the design and effectively control the sensitivity of the
THz-radiation detectors.

A lot of research on elastic interfaces has been done on systems where the
interface is pushed with a constant force. We studied the velocity of an
interface under a periodic subcritical driving, which is relevant in for
example magnetic hysteresis and fracturing of materials under repetitive
loading. We obtained a modified version of the creep velocity that describes
interfaces under small constant drivings and thermal noise. For short-range
elastic systems, the velocity follows an approximate power law with a material
dependent exponent. Long ranged systems have simpler behaviour without a
material dependent exponent.

<h3>Constitutive model for the rheology of biological tissue</h3>

<br>
<i>Suzanne M. Fielding, James O. Cochran, Junxiang Huang, Dapeng Bi, M. Cristina Marchetti</i>
<br>
The rheology of biological tissue is key to processes such as embryo
development, wound healing and cancer metastasis. Vertex models of confluent
tissue monolayers have uncovered a spontaneous liquid-solid transition tuned by
cell shape; and a shear-induced solidification transition of an initially
liquid-like tissue. Alongside this jamming/unjamming behaviour, biological
tissue also displays an inherent viscoelasticity, with a slow time and rate
dependent mechanics. With this motivation, we combine simulations and continuum
theory to examine the rheology of the vertex model in nonlinear shear across a
full range of shear rates from quastistatic to fast, elucidating its nonlinear
stress-strain curves after the inception of shear of finite rate, and its
steady state flow curves of stress as a function of strain rate. We formulate a
rheological constitutive model that couples cell shape to flow and captures
both the tissue solid-liquid transition and its rich linear and nonlinear
rheology.

<br>
We study the effects of disorder in a one-dimensional model of
$\mathbb{Z}_{3}$-Fock parafermions which can be viewed as a generalization of
the prototypical Kitaev chain. Exact diagonalization is employed to determine
level statistics, participation ratios, and the dynamics of domain walls. This
allows us to identify ergodic as well as finite-size localized phases. In order
to distinguish Anderson from many-body localization, we calculate the time
evolution of the entanglement entropy in random initial states using tensor
networks. We demonstrate that a purely quadratic parafermion model does not
feature Anderson but many-body localization due to the non-trivial statistics
of the particles.

<br>
Fabrication of ordered structures at the nanoscale limit poses a cornerstone
challenge for modern technologies. In this work we show how naturally occurring
moir\'e patterns in Ir(111)-supported graphene template the formation of 2D
ordered arrays of substitutional boron species. A complementary experimental
and theoretical approach provides a comprehensive description of the boron
species distribution, bonding configurations, interfacial interaction with
Ir(111) and the impact on graphene's electronic structure. Atomically-resolved
scanning tunnelling microscopy images and density functional theory
calculations reveal that boron preferably forms small aggregates of
substitutional defects in geometrically low regions of the moir\'e superlattice
of graphene, by inducing local bending of graphene towards the underlying
Ir(111). Surprisingly, calculations reveal that the incorporation of electron
deficient boron does not lead to an enhanced p-type doping, as the local
rippling of the graphene layer prompts electron uptake from the iridium
substrate that compensates the initial electron loss due to substitutional
boron. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy measurements corroborate that the arrays of boron species do not
modify the electronic structure of graphene near the Fermi level, hence
preserving the slight p-type doping induced by Ir(111).

We discuss a Kohn-Luttinger-like mechanism for superconductivity in Bernal
bilayer graphene and rhombohedral trilayer graphene. Working within the
continuum model description, we find that the screened long-range Coulomb
interaction alone gives rise to superconductivity with critical temperatures
that agree with experiments. We observe that the order parameter changes sign
between valleys, which implies that both materials are valley-singlet,
spin-triplet superconductors. Adding Ising spin-orbit coupling leads to a
significant enhancement in the critical temperature, also in line with
experiment. The superconducting order parameter shows locking between the spin
and valley degrees of freedom.

Generation of perpendicular effective magnetic field or perpendicular spins
({\sigma}z) is central for the development of energy-efficient, scalable, and
external-magnetic-field-free spintronic memory and computing technologies.
Here, we report the first identification and the profound impacts of a
significant effective perpendicular magnetic field that can arise from
asymmetric current spreading within magnetic microstrips and Hall bars. This
effective perpendicular magnetic field can exhibit all the three
characteristics that have been widely assumed in the literature to "signify"
the presence of a flow of {\sigma}z, i.e., external-magnetic-field-free current
switching of uniform perpendicular magnetization, a sin2{\phi}-dependent
contribution in spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance signal of in-plane
magnetization ({\phi} is the angle of the external magnetic field with respect
to the current, and a {\phi}-independent but field-dependent contribution in
the second harmonic Hall voltage of in-plane magnetization. This finding
suggests that it is critical to include current spreading effects in the
analyses of various spin polarizations and spin-orbit torques in magnetic
heterostructure. Technologically, our results provide perpendicular effective
magnetic field induced by asymmetric current spreading as a novel, universally
accessible mechanism for efficient, scalable, and external-magnetic-field-free
magnetization switching in memory and computing technologies.

<br>
Detection is most often the main impediment to reduce the number of spins in
paramagnetic resonance experiments. Here we propose a new route to carry out
electrically-detected spin resonance of an individual spin, placed at the edge
of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI). The edges of a QSHI host a one
dimensional electron gas with perfect spin-momentum locking. Therefore, the
spin relaxation induced by emission of an electron-hole pair at the edge state
of the QSHI can generate current. Here we demonstrate that driving the system
with an $AC$ signal, a nonequilibrium occupation can be induced in the absence
of applied bias voltage, resulting in a $DC$ measurable current. We compute the
$DC$ current as a function of the Rabi frequency $\Omega$, the spin relaxation
and decoherence times, $T_1$ and we discuss the feasibility of this experiment
with state-of-the-art instrumentation.

<br>
Layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-NbSe_2 is a good candidate to
explore the charge density wave (CDW) and Mott physics. However, the effects of
stacking orders and interlayer coupling in CDW 1T-NbSe_2 are still less
explored and understood. Using density functional theory calculations, we
present a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic properties of
monolayer and layered CDW 1T-NbSe_2. Our results indicate that monolayer CDW
1T-NbSe_2 is a magnetic insulator with \sqrt13\times\sqrt13 periodic lattice
modulation. Nevertheless, the magnetic properties of bilayer CDWs 1T-NbSe_2 are
found stacking orders dependence. The mechanism is understood by the changes of
local magnetic moments in each layer due to spin charge transfer between
interlayers. Furthermore, the bulk CDW 1T-NbSe_2 opens a band gap with 0.02 eV
in 1\times 1 \times 2 supercell due to the interlayer spin coupling. We also
discover that the electronic structures of layered 1T-NbSe_2 show a strong
dependence on stacking configurations and dimensionality.

Featuring excellent coherence and operated parallelly, ultracold atoms in
optical lattices form a competitive candidate for quantum computation. For
this, a massive number of parallel entangled atom pairs have been realized in
superlattices. However, the more formidable challenge is to scale-up and detect
multipartite entanglement due to the lack of manipulations over local atomic
spins in retro-reflected bichromatic superlattices. Here we developed a new
architecture based on a cross-angle spin-dependent superlattice for
implementing layers of quantum gates over moderately-separated atoms
incorporated with a quantum gas microscope for single-atom manipulation. We
created and verified functional building blocks for scalable multipartite
entanglement by connecting Bell pairs to one-dimensional 10-atom chains and
two-dimensional plaquettes of $2\times4$ atoms. This offers a new platform
towards scalable quantum computation and simulation.

We study the effects of a random magnetic field on a one-dimensional (1D)
spin-1 chain with correlated nearest-neigbor XY interaction. We show that this
spin model can be exactly mapped onto the 1D disordered tight-binding model of
${\mathbb Z}_3$ Fock parafermions (FPFs), exotic anyonic quasiparticles that
generalize usual spinless fermions. Thus, we have a peculiar case of a
disordered Hamiltonian that, despite being bilinear in the creation and
annihilation operators, exhibits a many-body localization (MBL) transition
owing to the non-trivial statistics of FPFs. This is in sharp contrast to
conventional bosonic and fermionic quadratic disordered Hamiltonians that show
single-particle (Anderson) localization. We perform finite-size exact
diagonalization calculations of level-spacing statistics, fractal dimensions,
and entanglement entropy, and provide convincing evidence for the MBL
transition at finite disorder strength.

<br>
The band connectivity as imposed by the compatibility relations between the
irreducible representations of little groups can give rise to the exotic
hourglass-like shape composed of four branches of bands and five band crossings
(BCs). Such an hourglass band connectivity could enforce the emergence of
nontrivial excitations like Weyl fermion, Dirac fermion or even beyond them. On
the other hand, the bosons, like phonons, magnons, and photons, were also shown
to possess nontrivial topology and a comprehensive symmetry classification of
the hourglass bosonic excitations would be of great significance to both
materials design and device applications. Here we firstly list all concrete
positions and representations of little groups in the Brillouin zone (BZ)
related with the hourglass bosonic excitations in all the 1651 magnetic space
groups and 528 magnetic layer groups, applicable to three dimensional (3D) and
two dimensional (2D) systems, respectively. 255 (42) MSGs (MLGs) are found to
essentially host such hourglass BCs: Here ``essentially'' means that the
bosonic hourglass BC exists definitely as long as the studied system is
crystallized in the corresponding MSG/MLG. We also perform first-principles
calculations on hundreds of 3D nonmagnetic materials essentially hosting
hourglass phonons and propose that the 2D material AlI can host hourglass
phonons. We choose AuX (X=Br and I) as illustrative examples to demonstrate
that two essential hourglass band structures can coexist in the phonon spectra
for both materials while for AuBr, an accidental band crossing sticking two
hourglasses is found interestingly. Our results of symmetry conditions for
hourglass bosonic excitations can provide a useful guide of designing
artificial structures with hourglass bosonic excitations.

Quantum phases of solid-state electron systems look poised to sustain exotic

microelectronic foundries. Here we show how Ge1-xSnx alloys, an emerging group
IV semiconductor, can be engineered into junctions that demonstrate a broken
gap alignment. We predict such basic building block undergo a quantum phase
transition that can elegantly accommodate the existence of gate-controlled
chiral edge states directly on Si. This will enable tantalizing prospects for
designing integrated circuits hosting quantum spin hall insulators and advanced
topological functionalities.

Both quantum transport measurements in the Pauli blockade regime and
microwave cavity transmission measurements are important tools for spin-qubit
readout and characterization. Based on a generalized input-output theory we
derive a theoretical framework to investigate how a double quantum dot (DQD) in
a transport setup interacts with a coupled microwave resonator while the
current through the DQD is rectified by Pauli blockade. We show that the output
field of the resonator can be used to infer the leakage current and thus obtain
insight into the blockade mechanisms. In the case of a silicon DQD, we show how
the valley quasi-degeneracy can impose limitations on this scheme. We also
demonstrate that a large number of unknown DQD parameters including (but not
limited to) the valley splitting can be estimated from the resonator response
simultaneous to a transport experiment, providing more detailed knowledge about
the microscopic environment of the DQD. Furthermore, we describe and quantify a
back-action of the resonator photons on the steady state leakage current.

<h3>Polar metals: Principles and Prospects</h3>

<br>
We review the class of materials known as polar metals, in which polarity and
metallicity coexist in the same phase. While the notion of polar metals was
first invoked more than 50 years ago, their practical realization has proved
challenging, since the itinerant carriers required for metallicity tend to
screen any polarization. Huge progress has been made in the last decade, with
many mechanisms for combining polarity and metallicity proposed, and the first
examples, LiOsO3 and WTe2, identified experimentally. The availability of polar
metallic samples has opened a new paradigm in polar metal research, with
implications in the fields of topology, ferroelectricity, magnetoelectricity,
spintronics, and superconductivity. Here, we review the principles and
techniques that have been developed to design and engineer polar metals and
describe some of their interesting properties, with a focus on the most
promising directions for future work.

The ground state of the homogeneous electron gas is a cornerstone in quantum
physics and che\-mis\-try. It is an archetypal system in the regime of slowly
varying densities in which the exchange-corre\-la\-tion energy can be estimated
with a myriad of methods. For high densities, the behaviour the energy is
well-known for 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. Here, we extend this model to arbitrary
integer dimensions, and compute its correlation energy beyond the random phase
approximation (RPA), using the celebrated approach developed by Singwi, Tosi,
Land, and Sj\"olander (STLS), which is known to be remarkably accurate in the
description of the full electronic density response. For two and three
dimensions, both in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states, STLS is
capable of producing correlation energies in close agreement with Monte-Carlo
values. For higher dimensions, we compare the results obtained for the
correlation energy using the STLS method with the values previously obtained
using RPA. We furthermore illustrate the importance of the plasmon contribution
to STLS theory.

<h3>Information scrambling of the dilute Bose gas at low temperature</h3>

<br>
We calculate the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ and butterfly velocity
$v_B$ in the dilute Bose gas at temperature $T$ deep in the Bose-Einstein
condensation phase. The generalized Boltzmann equation approach is used for
calculating out-of-time ordered correlators, from which $\lambda_L$ and $v_B$
are extracted. At very low temperature where elementary excitations are
phonon-like, we find $\lambda_L\propto T^5$ and $v_B\sim c$, the sound
velocity. At relatively high temperature, we have $\lambda_L\propto T$ and
$v_B\sim c(T/T_*)^{0.23}$. We find $\lambda_L$ is always comparable to the
damping rate of a quasiparticle, whose energy depends suitably on $T$. The
chaos diffusion constant $D_L=v_B^2/\lambda_L$, on the other hand, differs from
the energy diffusion constant $D_E$. We find $D_E\ll D_L$ at very low
temperature and $D_E\gg D_L$ otherwise.

<h3>Equilibrium and dynamics of a three-state opinion model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03054</a>
<br>
<i>Irene Ferri, Albert Díaz-Guilera, Matteo Palassini</i>
<br>
We introduce a three-state model to study the effects of a neutral party on
opinion spreading, in which the tendency of agents to agree with their
neighbors can be tuned to favor either the neutral party or two oppositely
polarized parties, and can be disrupted by social agitation mimicked as
temperature. We study the equilibrium phase diagram and the non-equilibrium
stochastic dynamics of the model with various analytical approaches and with
Monte Carlo simulations on different substrates: the fully-connected (FC)
graph, the one-dimensional (1D) chain, and Erd\"os-R\'enyi (ER) random graphs.
We show that, in the mean-field approximation, the phase boundary between the
disordered and polarized phases is characterized by a tricritical point. On the
FC graph, in the absence of social agitation, kinetic barriers prevent the
system from reaching optimal consensus. On the 1D chain, the main result is
that the dynamics is governed by the growth of opinion clusters. Finally, for
the ER ensemble a phase transition analogous to that of the FC graph takes
place, but now the system is able to reach optimal consensus at low
temperatures, except when the average connectivity is low, in which case
dynamical traps arise from local frozen configurations.

<h3>Magnetic excitations in the helical Rashba superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03059</a>
<br>
<i>Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier</i>
<br>
We investigate the magnetic excitation spectrum in the helical state of a
noncentrosymmetric superconductor with inversion symmetry breaking and strong
Rashba spin-orbit coupling. For this purpose, we derive the general expressions
of the dynamical spin response functions under the presence of strong Rashba
splitting of conduction bands, superconducting gap, and external field which
lead to stabilization of Cooper pairs with finite overall momentum in a helical
state. The latter is characterized by momentum space regions of paired and
unpaired states with different quasiparticle dispersions. The magnetic response
is determined by i) excitations within and between both paired and unpaired
regions ii) anomalous coherence factors and iii) additional spin matrix
elements due to helical Rashba spin texture of bands. We show that as a
consequence typical correlated real space and spin space anisotropies appear in
the dynamical susceptibility which would be observable as a characteristic
fingerprint for a helical superconducting state in inelastic neutron scattering
investigations.

<h3>MagNet: machine learning enhanced three-dimensional magnetic  reconstruction</h3>

Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconstruction is vital to the study of novel
magnetic materials for 3D spintronics. Vector field electron tomography (VFET)
is a major in house tool to achieve that. However, conventional VFET
reconstruction exhibits significant artefacts due to the unavoidable presence
of missing wedges. In this article, we propose a deep-learning enhanced VFET
method to address this issue. A magnetic textures library is built by
micromagnetic simulations. MagNet, an U-shaped convolutional neural network, is
trained and tested with dataset generated from the library. We demonstrate that
MagNet outperforms conventional VFET under missing wedge. Quality of
reconstructed magnetic induction fields is significantly improved.

<h3>Ferroelectric switching at symmetry-broken interfaces by local control  of dislocation networks</h3>

<br>
Semiconducting ferroelectric materials with low energy polarisation switching
offer a platform for next-generation electronics such as ferroelectric
field-effect transistors. Ferroelectric domains at symmetry-broken interfaces
of transition metal dichalcogenide films provide an opportunity to combine the
potential of semiconducting ferroelectrics with the design flexibility of
two-dimensional material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains
in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling
microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution
understood using a string-like model of the domain wall network. We identify
two characteristic regimes of domain evolution: (i) elastic bending of partial
screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stacking and (ii)
formation of perfect screw dislocations by merging pairs of primary domain
walls. We also show that the latter act as the seeds for the reversible
restoration of the inverted polarisation. These results open the possibility to
achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains
using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their
technological use.

<h3>Bayesian autotuning of Hubbard model quantum simulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03077" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03077</a>
<br>
<i>Ludmila Szulakowska, Jun Dai</i>
<br>
Spins in gated semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising platform for
Hubbard model simulation inaccessible to computation. Precise control of the
tunnel couplings by tuning voltages on metallic gates is vital for a successful
QD-based simulator. However, the number of tunable voltages and the complexity
of the relationships between gate voltages and the parameters of the resulting
Hubbard models quickly increase with the number of quantum dots. As a
consequence, it is not known if and how a particular gate geometry yields a
target Hubbard model. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid
machine-learning approach using a combination of support vector machines (SVMs)
and Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify combinations of voltages that
realize a desired Hubbard model. SVM constrains the space of voltages by
rejecting voltage combinations producing potentials unsuitable for
tight-binding (TB) approximation. The target voltage combinations are then
identified by BO in the constrained subdomain. For large QD arrays, we propose
a scalable efficient iterative procedure using our SVM-BO approach, which
optimises voltage subsets and utilises a two-QD SVM model for large systems.
Our results use experimental gate lithography images and accurate integrals
calculated with linear combinations of harmonic orbitals to train the machine
learning algorithms.

<h3>Mixed higher-order topology: boundary non-Hermitian skin effect induced  by a Floquet bulk</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03097</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Liu, Ion Cosma Fulga</i>
<br>
We show that anomalous Floquet topological insulators generate intrinsic,
non-Hermitian topology on their boundary. As a consequence, removing a boundary
hopping from the time-evolution operator stops the propagation of chiral edge
modes, leading to a non-Hermitian skin effect. This does not occur in Floquet
Chern insulators, however, in which boundary modes continue propagating. By
evaluating the local density of states, we found that the resulting
non-Hermitian skin effect is critical, i.e. scale-invariant, due to the nonzero
coupling between the bulk and the edge. Further, it is a consequence of the
nontrivial topology of the bulk Floquet operator, which we show by designing a
real-space topological invariant. Our work introduces a form of 'mixed'
higher-order topology, where a bulk system characterized by Floquet topology
produces a boundary system characterized by non-Hermitian topology, without the
need for any added perturbations. This opens an alternate direction in the
study of topological classifications, and provides a route towards generating
non-Hermitian skin effects by means of periodic driving.
