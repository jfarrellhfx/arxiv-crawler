<h3>Stability of the many-body scars in fermionic spin-1/2 models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17164</a>
<br>
<i>Patrice Kolb, Kiryl Pakrouski</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the stability of the many-body scars in spin-1/2 fermionic systems
under the most typical perturbations in relevant materials. We find that some
families of scars are completely insensitive to certain perturbations. In some
other cases they are stable to the first order in perturbation theory. Our
analytical results apply to a large class of Hamiltonians that are known
[arXiv:2106.10300] to support exact many-body scars. For the numerical
calculations we choose the deformed $t-J-U$ model that includes both Heisenberg
and Hubbard interactions. We propose two new stability measures that are based
on physical observables rather than the fidelity to the exact initial
wavefunction. They enable the experimental detection of scars and are more
reliable from the theoretical and numerical perspectives. One of these measures
may potentially find applications in other systems where the exact many-body
scars are equally spaced in energy. In small systems and at small
perturbations, a regime particularly relevant for quantum simulators, we
identify and describe an additional stability exhibited by the many-body scars.
For larger perturbation strengths we observe a distinct mode of ergodicity
breaking that is consistent with many-body localization.

<h3>Ubiquitous nematic Dirac semimetal emerging from interacting quadratic  band touching system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17189" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17189</a>

<br>
<br>
Quadratic band touching (QBT) points are widely observed in 2D and 3D
materials, including bilayer graphene and Luttinger semimetals, and attract
significant attention from theory to experiment. However, even in its simplest
form, the 2D checkerboard lattice QBT model, the phase diagram characterized by
temperature and interaction strength still remains unknown beyond the
weak-coupling regime. Intense debates persist regarding the existence of
various interaction-driven insulating states in this system [1-7]. To address
these uncertainties, we employ thermal tensor network simulations, specifically
exponential tensor renormalization group [8], along with density matrix
renormalization group calculations. Our approach enables us to provide a
comprehensive finite-temperature phase diagram for this model and shed light on
previous ambiguities. Notably, our findings consistently reveal the emergence
of a robust bond-nematic Dirac semimetal (BNDS) phase as an intermediate state
between the nematic insulating state and other symmetry broken states. This
previously overlooked feature is found to be ubiquitous in interacting QBT
systems. We also discuss the implications of these results for experimental
systems such as bilayer graphene and iridate compounds.

<h3>One-particle and excitonic band structure in cubic Boron Arsenide</h3>

Cubic BAs has received recent attention for its large electron and hole
mobilities and large thermal conductivity. This is a rare and much desired
combination in semiconductor industry: commercial semiconductors typically have
high electron mobilities, or hole mobilities, or large thermal conductivities,
but not all of them together. Here we report predictions from an advanced
self-consistent many body perturbative theory and show that with respect to
one-particle properties, BAs is strikingly similar to Si. There are some
important differences, notably there is an unusually small variation in the
valence band masses . With respect to two-particle properties, significant
differences with Si appear. We report the excitonic spectrum for both q=0 and
finite q, and show that while the direct gap in cubic BAs is about 4 eV, dark
excitons can be observed down to about $\sim$1.5 eV, which may play a crucial
role in application of BAs in optoelectronics.

<h3>Boost driven transition in the superconductivity proximitized edge of a  quantum spin Hall insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17229</a>
<br>
<i>Suman Jyoti De, Udit Khanna, Sumathi Rao, Sourin Das</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effects of introducing a boost (a Zeeman field parallel to
the spin quantization axis) at the proximitized helical edge of a
two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulator. Our self-consistent analysis
finds that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting phase may
emerge at the edge when the boost is larger than a critical value tied to the
induced pairing gap. A non-trivial consequence of retaining the 2D bulk in the
model is that this boundary FFLO state supports a finite magnetization as well
as finite current (flowing along the edge). This has implications for a proper
treatment of the ultra-violet cutoff in analyses employing the effective
one-dimensional (1D) helical edge model. Our results may be contrasted with
previous studies of such 1D models, which found that the FFLO phase either does
not appear for any value of the boost (in non-self-consistent calculations), or
that it self-consistently appears even for infinitesimal boost, but carries no
current and magnetization.

<h3>Quantum evolution with random phase scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17232" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17232</a>
<br>
<i>Klaus Ziegler</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the quantum evolution of a fermion-hole pair in a d-dimensional
gas of non-interacting fermions in the presence of random phase scattering.
This system is mapped onto an effective Ising model, which enables us to show
rigorously that the probability of recombining the fermion and the hole decays
exponentially with the distance of their initial spatial separation. In the
absence of random phase scattering the recombination probability decays like a
power law, which is reflected by an infinite mean square displacement. The
effective Ising model is studied within a saddle point approximation and yields
a finite mean square displacement that depends on the evolution time and on the
spectral properties of the deterministic part of the evolution operator.

<h3>$SO(8)$ unification and the large-N theory of superconductor-insulator  transition of two-dimensional Dirac fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17264" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17264</a>
<br>
<i>Igor F. Herbut, Subrata Mandal</i>
<br>
<br>
Electrons on honeycomb or pi-flux lattices obey effective massless Dirac
equation at low energies and at the neutrality point, and should suffer quantum
phase transitions into various Mott insulators and superconductors at strong
two-body interactions. We show that 35 out of 36 such order parameters that
provide Lorentz-invariant mass-gaps to Dirac fermions can be organized into a
single irreducible tensor representation of the $SO(8)$ symmetry of the
two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian for the spin-1/2 lattice fermions. The
minimal interacting Lagrangian away from the neutrality point has the $SO(8)$
symmetry reduced to $U(1) \times SU(4)$ by finite chemical potential, and it
allows only two independent interaction terms. When the Lagrangian is nearly
$SO(8)$-symmetric and the ground state insulating at the neutrality point, we
argue it turns superconducting at the critical value of the chemical potential
through a ``flop" between the tensor components. The theory is exactly solvable
when the $SU(4)$ is generalized to $SU(N)$ and $N$ taken large. A lattice
Hamiltonian that may exhibit this transition, parallels with the Gross-Neveu
model, and applicability to related electronic systems are briefly discussed.

<br>
<br>
In the past decades many density-functional theory methods and codes adopting
periodic boundary conditions have been developed and are now extensively used
in condensed matter physics and materials science research. Only in 2016,
however, their precision (i.e., to which extent properties computed with
different codes agree among each other) was systematically assessed on
elemental crystals: a first crucial step to evaluate the reliability of such
computations. We discuss here general recommendations for verification studies
aiming at further testing precision and transferability of
density-functional-theory computational approaches and codes. We illustrate
such recommendations using a greatly expanded protocol covering the whole
periodic table from Z=1 to 96 and characterizing 10 prototypical cubic
compounds for each element: 4 unaries and 6 oxides, spanning a wide range of
coordination numbers and oxidation states. The primary outcome is a reference
dataset of 960 equations of state cross-checked between two all-electron codes,
then used to verify and improve nine pseudopotential-based approaches. Such
effort is facilitated by deploying AiiDA common workflows that perform
automatic input parameter selection, provide identical input/output interfaces
across codes, and ensure full reproducibility. Finally, we discuss the extent
to which the current results for total energies can be reused for different
goals (e.g., obtaining formation energies).

<h3>On the Nature of Memory and Rejuvenation in Glassy Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17296" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17296</a>
<br>
<i>J. Freedberg, W. Joe Meese, J. He, D. L. Schlagel, E. Dan Dahlberg, R. L. Orbach</i>
<br>
<br>
The memory effect in a single crystal spin glass
($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using $1
\mathrm{Hz}$ ac susceptibility techniques over a reduced temperature range of
$0.4 - 0.7 \, T_g$ and a model of the memory effect has been developed. A
double-waiting-time protocol is carried out where the spin glass is first
allowed to age at a temperature below $T_g$, followed by a second aging at a
lower temperature after it has fully rejuvenated. The model is based on
calculating typical coincidences between the growth of correlated regions at
the two temperatures. It accounts for the absolute magnitude of the memory
effect as a function of both waiting times and temperatures. The data can be
explained by the memory loss being a function of the relative change in the
correlated volume at the first waiting temperature because of the growth in the
correlations at the second waiting temperature.

<h3>Three-dimensional Isotropic Droplets in Rydberg-dressed Bose Gases</h3>

<br>
<br>
We predict a scheme for the creation of isotropic three-dimensional droplets
in Rydbeg-dressed Bose gases, which contain both repulsive contact interactions
and attractive van der Waals interactions causing the quantum fluctuation
effect non-negligible. We present detailed beyond mean-field calculations with
Lee-Huang-Yang correction and demonstrate the existence of isotropic droplets
under realistic experimental conditions. Stable droplets possess flat-top
density distribution, and their chemical potentials decrease with the particle
number expansion towarding a critical value. We distinguish droplets from
bright solitons through peak density, width of condensate and quantum depletion
calculations. We summarize a phase diagram of realizing droplets, and
subsequently highlight the stability of droplets by real time evolution as well
as collisions. Our work provides a novel platform for investigating excitation
spectrum and superfluid nature of droplets.

<br>
<br>
Optical control of crystal structures is a promising route to change physical
properties including topological nature of a targeting material. Time-resolved
X-ray diffraction measurements using the X-ray free-electron laser are
performed to study the ultrafast lattice dynamics of VTe$_2$, which shows a
unique charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering coupled to the topological surface
states as a first-order phase transition. A significant oscillation of the CDW
amplitude mode is observed at a superlattice reflection as well as Bragg
reflections. The frequency of the oscillation is independent of the fluence of
the pumping laser, which is prominent to the CDW ordering of the first-order
phase transition. Furthermore, the timescale of the photoinduced
1$T^{\prime\prime}$ to 1$T$ phase transition is independent of the period of
the CDW amplitude mode.

<h3>Excitonic interactions and mechanism for ultrafast interlayer  photoexcited response in van der Waals heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17335</a>
<br>
<i>Chen Hu, Mit H. Naik, Yang-Hao Chan, Steven G. Louie</i>
<br>
<br>
Optical dynamics in van der Waals heterobilayers is of fundamental scientific
and practical interest. Based on a time-dependent adiabatic GW approach, we
discover a new many-electron (excitonic) channel for converting photoexcited
intralayer to interlayer excitations and the associated ultrafast optical
responses in heterobilayers, which is conceptually different from the
conventional single-particle picture. We find strong electron-hole interactions
drive the dynamics and enhance the pump-probe optical responses by an order of
magnitude with a rise time of ~300 fs in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers, in
agreement with experiment.

<h3>Fully-gapped superconductivity and topological aspects of the  noncentrosymmetric TaReSi superconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a study of the noncentrosymmetric TaReSi superconductor by means of
muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) technique, complemented by
electronic band-structure calculations. Its superconductivity, with $T_c$ = 5.5
K and upper critical field $\mu_0H_\mathrm{c2}(0)$ $\sim$ 3.4 T, was
characterized via electrical-resistivity- and magnetic-susceptibility
measurements. The temperature-dependent superfluid density, obtained from
transverse-field $\mu$SR, suggests a fully-gapped superconducting state in
TaReSi, with an energy gap $\Delta_0$ = 0.79 meV and a magnetic penetration
depth $\lambda_0$ = 562 nm. The absence of a spontaneous magnetization below
$T_c$, as confirmed by zero-field $\mu$SR, indicates a preserved time-reversal
symmetry in the superconducting state. The density of states near the Fermi
level is dominated by the Ta- and Re-5$d$ orbitals, which account for the
relatively large band splitting due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling.
In its normal state, TaReSi behaves as a three-dimensional Kramers nodal-line
semimetal, characterized by an hourglass-shaped dispersion protected by glide
reflection. By combining non\-triv\-i\-al electronic bands with intrinsic
superconductivity, TaReSi is a promising material for investigating the
topological aspects of noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

<h3>Simple model for frequency response of a resonant tunneling diode caused  by potential change of quantum well due to electron charge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17396" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17396</a>
<br>
<i>Masahiro Asada, Safumi Suzuki</i>
<br>
<br>
The frequency dependence of negative differential conductance (NDC) is an
important property for the resonant-tunneling-diode terahertz source. Among
several phenomena determining the frequency dependence, this paper shows that
the effect of potential change of the quantum well due to electron charge can
be analyzed with a simple and tractable model based on the tunneling admittance
and capacitance. The result is identical to that of Feiginov's analysis based
on more fundamental equations, showing a one-to-one correspondence between the
parameters of the two analyses. Similar to Feiginov's analysis, our analysis
also shows that NDC remains finite even at infinitely high frequency. It is
shown in our model that this result is attributed to neglecting the tunneling
time at the emitter barrier. Comprehensive analysis of the frequency dependence
of NDC will be possible by incorporating the tunneling time into the present
model.

<h3>A novel and sustainable method to develop non-equiatomic CoCrFeNiMox  high entropy alloys via spark plasma sintering using commercial commodity  powders and evaluation of its mechanical behaviour</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17407</a>
<br>
<i>S Venkatesh Kumaran, Dariusz Garbiec, José Manuel Torralba</i>
<br>
<br>
A novel approach to developing high entropy alloys (HEAs) using spark plasma
sintering (SPS) was explored in this work where a mix of commercial commodity
powders like Ni625, CoCrF75, and 316L was used instead of pre-alloyed powders
avoiding the expensive pre-alloying steps like mechanical alloying or gas
atomizing. Three non-equiatomic HEAs, based on Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Mo were
designed and developed by blending the powders which were sintered via SPS and
resulted in a single FCC phase after homogenization. The HEAs were
microstructurally and mechanically characterized with tensile and hot
compression tests up to a temperature of 750oC showing excellent properties.
The maximum room temperature tensile strength and ductility demonstrated was
712 MPa and 62% respectively, by the alloy Co23.28Cr28.57Fe25.03Ni21.01Mo2.1.
Moreover, the same alloy exhibited a compression strength greater than 640 MPa
with a ductility above 45% at a temperature of 750oC. Also, this study paves
the way for a novel fabrication route that offers more flexibility to develop
new HEAs cost-effectively and efficiently which is crucial for the discovery of
new materials over high-throughput techniques. Using such commodity alloys also
opens the possibility of developing ingot casting from recycled scraps avoiding
the direct use of critical metals.

<h3>Bond formation at polycarbonate | X interfaces (X = Al$_2$O$_3$,  TiO$_2$, TiAlO$_2$) studied by theory and experiments</h3>

<br>
<br>
Interfacial bond formation during sputter deposition of metal oxide thin
films onto polycarbonate (PC) is investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of PC | X
interfaces (X = Al$_2$O$_3$, TiO$_2$, TiAlO$_2$). Generally, the predicted bond
formation is consistent with the experimental data. For all three interfaces,
the majority of bonds identified by XPS are (C-O)-metal bonds, whereas C-metal
bonds are the minority. Compared to the PC | Al$_2$O$_3$ interface, the PC |
TiO$_2$ and PC | TiAlO$_2$ interfaces exhibit a reduction in the measured
interfacial bond density by ~ 75 and ~ 65%, respectively. Multiplying the
predicted bond strength with the corresponding experimentally determined
interfacial bond density shows that Al$_2$O$_3$ exhibits the strongest
interface with PC, while TiO$_2$ and TiAlO$_2$ exhibit ~ 70 and ~ 60% weaker
interfaces, respectively. This can be understood by considering the complex
interplay between the metal oxide composition, the bond strength as well as the
population of bonds that are formed across the interface.

<h3>Anomalous conductivity of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Fermi liquids</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider a non-Hermitian yet $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Fermi liquid
($\mathcal{PT}$-FL) in external electric fields. Due to
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the system exhibits real spectrum, Fermi surface and
electric conductivity are well-defined through propagators. We find that, in
contrast to the conventional Fermi liquids (FL), the $\mathcal{PT}$-FL can
exhibit a zero resistance state in the longitudinal ($xx$) channel. Moreover,
the temperature dependence of the resistivity anomaly violates the conventional
FL scaling (it is not limited by $T^2$). These findings open route to further
exploration of transport anomalies beyond the conventional paradigm.

<h3>Effects of Chemical and magnetic disorder on the electrochemical  properties of V$_{2-x}$Mn$_{x}$CO$_{2}$} MXene electrodes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Investigation of structure-property relations in chemically and magnetically
disordered materials can give rise to interesting physical phenomena. The
potential of two-dimensional MXenes as electrodes in supercapacitor
applications have been studied extensively. However, the role of chemical and
magnetic disorder on their electrochemical parameters like the capacitance have
not been explored yet. In this work, we have systematically addressed this for
V$_{2-x}$Mn$_{x}$CO$_{2}$ MXene solid solutions with an analysis based upon
results from first-principles electronic structure calculations. We find that
the variations in the total capacitance over a voltage window depends upon the
degree of chemical and magnetic disorder. In course of our investigation, we
also found out that the magnetic structure on the surface can substantially
influence the redox charge transfer, an yet unexplored phenomenon. A
significantly large charge transfer and thus a large capacitance can be
obtained by manipulating the chemical composition and the magnetic order of the
surfaces.These findings can be useful in designing operational supercapacitor
electrodes with magnetic constituents.

<h3>Anisotropic exciton polariton pairs as a platform for PT-symmetric  non-Hermitian physics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-Hermitian PT-symmetric systems can be conveniently realized in optical
systems in the classical domain and have been used to explore a plethora of
exotic phenomena like loss-induced lasing and selective propagation of chiral
modes in waveguides. On the other hand, a microcavity exciton-polariton system
is intrinsically non-Hermitian in the quantum regime. However, realization of
such systems in the PT-symmetric phase has not been achieved so far. Here we
show how a pair of nearly orthogonal sets of anisotropic exciton-polaritons can
offer a versatile platform for realizing multiple Eps and propose a roadmap to
achieve a PT-symmetric system. By utilizing the tunability of coupling strength
and energy detuning on the polarization of probe beam, the angle of incidence,
and the orientation of the anisotropic sample, we realise two kinds of Eps:
Polarization-tunable polariton dispersion creates one set of EPs based on
tunable coupling strength, while the rotating the sample reveals Voigt EPs for
specific orientations. Pair of anisotropic microcavity exciton-polaritons can
offer a promising platform not only for fundamental research in non-Hermitian
quantum physics and topological polaritons but also, we have proposed that it
can offer a system to realize zero threshold laser.

<h3>A Zero-Threshold Polariton-Raman Laser</h3>

<br>
Raman lasers are known for their low power operation and wavelength
tunability unattainable by conventional lasers. Recently ultralow-threshold
Raman lasers had been realized in semiconductors with various geometries.
Zero-threshold lasers were realized previously only in single atom emitter
strongly coupled in a single mode cavity with spontaneous emission coupling
factor of unity. However, this was not feasible in microcavities hosting
isotropic Raman active materials with degenerate bare cavity modes. Here we
show that a zero threshold Raman laser can be achieved when Stoke shifted
polariton Raman modes are tuned within one of the anisotropic exciton-polariton
bands in an optical microcavity. In addition, we demonstrate that Raman active
anisotropic exciton-polaritons in a single mode microcavity offers a platform
to realize a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum system of two nearly orthogonal
polariton modes that constitute a non-trivial band dispersion containing
exceptional points. We found that the PT-symmetric phase responsible for the
zero-threshold lasing can be switched to a finite threshold in PT-symmetry
broken phase via cavity detuning by the variation of bath temperature, as well
as by the variation of pump polarization and energy. Our discovery of zero
threshold polariton Raman laser, would not only open up several new paradigms
of applications in the areas of quantum optics and on-chip photonics but also
offer a platform for research in quantum physics of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian
system.

We explore a technique for probing energy spectra in synthetic lattices that
is analogous to scanning tunneling microscopy. Using one-dimensional synthetic
lattices of coupled atomic momentum states, we explore this spectroscopic
technique and observe qualitative agreement between the measured and simulated
energy spectra for small two- and three-site lattices as well as a uniform
many-site lattice. Finally, through simulations, we show that this technique

energy spectrum of the Hofstadter model as realized in synthetic lattices.

The efficient optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) of two-dimensional
(2D) crystals, coupled with their atomic thickness that circumvents the
phase-match problem, has garnered considerable attention. While various 2D
heterostructures have shown promising applications in photodetectors, switching
electronics, and photovoltaics, the modulation of nonlinear optical properties
in such hetero-systems remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate
exciton sensitized SHG in heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs), where photoexcitation of one donor layer enhances the SHG response of
the other as an acceptor. We utilize polarization-resolved interferometry to
detect the SHG intensity and phase of each individual layer, revealing the
energetic match between the excitonic resonances of donors and the SHG
enhancement of acceptors for four TMD combinations. Our results also uncover
the dynamic nature of interlayer coupling, as evidenced by the dependence of
sensitization on interlayer gap spacing and the average power of the
fundamental beam. This work provides insights into how interlayer coupling of
two different layers can modify nonlinear optical phenomena in 2D
heterostructures.

Enhancing robustness of topological orders against perturbations is one of
the main goals in topological quantum computing. Since the kinetic of
excitations is in conflict with the robustness of topological orders, any
mechanism that reduces the mobility of excitations will be in favor of
robustness. A strategy in this direction is adding frustration to topological
systems. In this paper we consider a frustrated toric code on a kagome lattice,
and show that although increasing the strength of perturbation reduces the
topological order of the system, it cannot destroy it completely. Our
frustrated toric code is indeed a quantum loop gas model with string tension
and pressure which their competition leads to a partially topological phase
(PTP) in which the excitations are restricted to move in particular
sublattices. In this phase the ground state is a product of many copies of
fluctuating loop states corresponding to quasi one dimensional ladders. By
defining a non-local matrix order parameter and studying the behavior of ground
state global entanglement (GE), we distinguish the PTP from the standard
topological phase. The partial mobility of excitations in our system is a
reminiscent of fracton codes with restricted mobility, and therefore our
results propose an alternative way for making such a restriction in three
dimension.

<h3>Valence electron concentration- and N vacancy-induced elasticity in  cubic early transition metal nitrides</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by frequently reported deviations from stoichiometry in cubic
transition metal nitride (TMNx) thin films, the effect of N-vacancy
concentration on the elastic properties of cubic TiNx, ZrNx, VNx, NbNx, and
MoNx (0.72<x<1.00) is systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The predictions are validated experimentally for VNx
(0.77<x<0.97). The DFT results indicate that the elastic behavior of the TMNx
depends on both the N-vacancy concentration and the valence electron
concentration (VEC) of the transition metal: While TiNx and ZrNx exhibit
vacancy-induced reductions in elastic modulus, VNx and NbNx show an increase.
These trends can be rationalized by considering vacancy-induced changes in
elastic anisotropy and bonding. While introduction of N-vacancies in TiNx
results in a significant reduction of elastic modulus along all directions and
a lower average bond strength of Ti-N, the vacancy-induced reduction in [001]
direction of VNx is overcompensated by the higher stiffness along [011] and
[111] directions, resulting in a higher average bond strength of V-N. To
validate the predicted vacancy-induced changes in elasticity experimentally,
close-to-single-crystal VNx (0.77<x<0.97) are grown on MgO(001) substrates. As
the N-content is reduced, the relaxed lattice parameter a0, as probed by X-ray
diffraction, decreases from 4.128 A to 4.096 A. This reduction in lattice
parameter is accompanied by an anomalous 11% increase in elastic modulus, as
determined by nanoindentation. As the experimental data agree with the
predictions, the elasticity enhancement in VNx upon N-vacancy formation can be
understood based on the concomitant changes in elastic anisotropy and bonding.

<h3>Activity-Induced Annealing leads to Ductile-to-Brittle Transition in  Amorphous Solids</h3>

Investigating the behavior of amorphous solids under various external loading
conditions continues to be an intriguing area of research with significant
practical implications. In this study, we demonstrate the utilization of
self-motility as a means to anneal glasses and use that as a means to fine-tune
the failure mode of the system under uniaxial tensile deformation. We begin by
highlighting the annealing effects of activity and draw parallels with other
well-known mechanical annealing processes, such as oscillatory shearing (both
uni- and multi-directional). Furthermore, we explore the annealing effects in
the presence of open boundaries, observing enhanced surface relaxations due to
activity. By implementing various activity-induced annealing protocols, we
successfully induce a transition in the failure mode from ductile to brittle.
This is demonstrated via performing tensile tests on the glass samples
resulting from the active-annealing process. The intricate effects of geometry
on the formation of shear bands are also examined. We find that samples having
an aspect ratio greater than one fail via shear band formation, owing to their
formation angle of $45\degree$ from the strain axis. In conclusion, we
introduce a novel method for producing well-annealed glasses in silico and
establish a correspondence between sheared and actively driven glasses.

Bi$_2$Te$_{3-x}$Se$_{x}$ (x = 0, 2, 3) by polarization resolved resonant Raman
spectroscopy. By tracking the spectral intensity of the surface phonon modes
with respect to the incident photon energy, we show that the surface phonons
are qualitatively similar to their bulk counterparts. Using the resonant Raman
excitation profile, we estimated the binding energy of the surface conduction
bands relative to bulk conduction bands. In addition, by analyzing the Fano
interaction between the electronic continuum and the surface phonons as a
function of incident photon energy, we determined the spectral properties of
the electronic continuum excitations between surface and bulk states in
Bi$_2$Se$_3$.

<i>Raju Baral, Milinda Abeykoon, Branton J. Campbell, Benjamin A. Frandsen</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive x-ray scattering study of spontaneous
magnetostriction in hexagonal MnTe, an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with a
Neel temperature of $T_{\mathrm{N}} = 307$ K. We observe the largest
spontaneous magnetovolume effect known for an antiferromagnet, reaching a
volume contraction of $|\Delta V/V| > 7 \times 10^{-3}$. This can be justified
semiquantitatively by considering bulk material properties, the spatial
dependence of the superexchange interaction, and the geometrical arrangement of
magnetic moments in MnTe. The highly unusual linear scaling of the
magnetovolume effect with the short-range magnetic correlations, beginning in
the paramagnetic state well above $T_{\mathrm{N}}$, points to a novel physical
mechanism, which we explain in terms of a trilinear coupling of the elastic
strain with superposed distinct domains of the antiferromagnetic order
parameter. This novel mechanism for coupling lattice strain to robust
short-range magnetic order casts new light on magnetostrictive phenomena and
also provides a template by which the exceptional magnetostrictive properties
of MnTe might be realized in a wide range of other functional materials.

Despite its simple crystal structure, layered boron nitride features a
surprisingly complex variety of phonon-assisted luminescence peaks. We present
a combined experimental and theoretical study on ultraviolet-light emission in
hexagonal and rhombohedral bulk boron nitride crystals. Emission spectra of
high-quality samples are measured via cathodoluminescence spectroscopy,
displaying characteristic differences between the two polytypes. These
differences are explained using a fully first-principles computational
technique that takes into account radiative emission from ``indirect'',
finite-momentum, excitons via coupling to finite-momentum phonons. We show that
the differences in peak positions, number of peaks and relative intensities can
be qualitatively and quantitatively explained, once a full integration over all
relevant momenta of excitons and phonons is performed.

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) show
impressive performance in applications, such as supercapacitors, batteries,
electromagnetic interference shielding, or electrocatalysis. These materials
combine the electronic and mechanical properties of 2D inorganic crystals with
chemically modifiable surfaces, and surface-engineered MXenes represent an
ideal platform for fundamental and applied studies of interfaces in 2D
functional materials. A natural step in structural engineering of MXene
compounds is the development and understanding of MXenes with various organic
functional groups covalently bound to inorganic 2D sheets. Such hybrid
structures have the potential to unite the tailorability of organic molecules
with the unique electronic properties of inorganic 2D solids. Here, we
introduce a new family of hybrid MXenes (h-MXenes) with amido- and
imido-bonding between organic and inorganic parts. The description of h-MXene
structure requires an intricate mix of concepts from the fields of coordination
chemistry, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and surface science. The optical
properties of h-MXenes reveal coherent coupling between the organic and
inorganic components. h-MXenes also show superior stability against hydrolysis

<br>
<br>
We study the two-dimensional motion of a magnetic skyrmion driven by a
ratchetlike polarized electric current that is periodic in both space and time.
Some general cases are considered, in each of which,in the low temperature and
adiabatic limit, regardless of the details of the driving current, the time and
statistical average velocity along any direction is topologically quantized as
a Chern number, multiplied by a basic unit. We make two approaches, one based
on identifying the drift direction, and the other based on the nonhermitian
adiabatic perturbation theory developed for the Fokker-Planck operator. Both
approach applies in the case of periodicity along the direction of the driving
current and homogeneity in the transverse direction, for which the analytical
result is confirmed by our numerical simulation on the constituent spins,and a
convenient experiment is proposed.

<h3>The fate of the "vacuum point'' and of grey solitons in dispersive  quantum shock waves in a one-dimensional Bose gas</h3>

<br>
<i>S. A. Simmons, J. C. Pillay, K. V. Kheruntsyan</i>
<br>
<br>
We continue the study of dispersive quantum shock waves in a one-dimensional
Bose gas beyond the mean-field approximation. In a recent work by Simmons et
al. [Phys. Rev. Let. 125, 180401 (2020)], the oscillatory shock wave train
developing in this system from an initial localized density bump on a uniform
background was interpreted as a result of quantum mechanical self-interference,
wherein the interference contrast would diminish with the loss of matter-wave
phase coherence. Such loss of coherence, relative to the mean-field
Gross-Pitaevskii description, occurs due to either quantum or thermal
fluctuations, as well as in the strongly interacting regime. In this work, we
extend the analysis of dispersive quantum shock waves in this context to other
dynamical scenarios. More specifically, the scenarios studied include evolution
of a sufficiently high density bump, known to lead to the so-called ``vacuum
point'' in the mean-field description, and evolution of an initial density dip,
known to shed a train of grey solitons in the same mean-field approximation. We
study the fate of these nonlinear wave structures in the presence of quantum
and thermal fluctuations, as well as at intermediate and strong interactions,
and show that both the vacuum point and grey solitons cease to manifest
themselves beyond the mean-field approach. On the other hand, we find that a
vacuum point can occur in an ideal (noninteracting) Bose gas evolving from a
ground state of a localized dimple potential. Due to the ubiquity of dispersive
shock waves in nature, our results should provide useful insights and
perspectives for a variety of other physical systems known to display nonlinear
wave phenomena.

<h3>Emergence of flat bands and their impact on superconductivity of  Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The first-principles calculations and measurements of the magnetic
penetration depths, the upper critical field, and the specific heat were
performed for a family of Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$ superconducotrs.
First-principles calculations suggest the presence of a flat band dispersion,
which gradually shifts to the Fermi level as a function of phosphorus doping
$x$. The flat band approaches the Fermi level at $x\simeq 1.3$, thus separating
Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$ between the purely steep band and the steep band/flat
band superconducting regimes. The emergence of flat bands lead to an abrupt
change of nearly all the superconducting quantities. In particular, a strong
reduction of the coherence length $\xi$ and enhancement of the penetration
depth $\lambda$ result in nearly factor of three increase of the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa=\lambda/\xi$ (from $\kappa\simeq 25$ for
$x\lesssim 1.2$ to $\kappa\simeq 70$ for $x\gtrsim 1.4$) thus initiating the
transition of Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$ from a moderate to an extreme type-II
superconductivity.

<h3>Quantum Geometry of Non-Hermitian Topological Systems</h3>

Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades.
Earlier research focused on Hermitian Hamiltonians, but recently, peculiar and
interesting properties were found by introducing non-Hermiticity. In this work,
we apply a quantum geometric approach to various Hermitian and non-Hermitian
versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We find that this method
allows one to correctly identify different topological phases and topological
phase transitions for all SSH models, but only when using the metric tensor
containing both left and right eigenvectors. Whereas the quantum geometry of
Hermitian systems is Riemannian, introducing non-Hermiticity leads to
pseudo-Riemannian and complex geometries, thus significantly generalizing from
the quantum geometries studied thus far. One remarkable example of this is the
mathematical agreement between topological phase transition curves and
lightlike paths in general relativity, suggesting a possibility of simulating
space-times in non-Hermitian systems. We find that the metric in non-Hermitian
phases degenerates in such a way that it effectively reduces the dimensionality
of the quantum geometry by one. This implies that within linear response
theory, one can perturb the system by a particular change of parameters while
maintaining a zero excitation rate.

In recent years, developing unsupervised machine learning for identifying
phase transition is a research direction. In this paper, we introduce a
two-times clustering method that can help select perfect configurations from a
set of degenerate samples and assign the configuration with labels in a manner
of unsupervised machine learning. These perfect configurations can then be used
to train a neural network to classify phases. The derivatives of the predicted
classification in the phase diagram, show peaks at the phase transition points.
The effectiveness of our method is tested for the Ising, Potts, and Blume-Capel
models. By using the ordered configuration from two-times clustering, our
method can provide a useful way to obtain phase diagrams.

Phonons have provided an ideal platform for a variety of intriguing physical
states, such as non-abelian braiding and Haldane model. It is promising that
phonons will realize the complicated nodal states accompanying with unusual
quantum phenomena. Here, we propose the hybrid nodal surface and nodal line
(NS+NL) phonons beyond the single genre nodal phonons. We categorize the NS+NL
phonons into two-band and four-band situations based on symmetry analysis and
compatibility relationships. Combing database screening with first-principles
calculations, we identify the ideal candidate materials for realizing all
categorized NS+NL phonons. Our calculations and tight-binding models further
demonstrate that the interplay between NS and NL induces unique phenomena. In
space group 113, the quadratic NL acts as a hub of the Berry curvature between
two NSs, generating ribbon-like surface states. In space group 128, the NS
serve as counterpart of Weyl NL that NS-NL mixed topological surface states are
observed. Our findings extend the scope of hybrid nodal states and enrich the
phononic states in realistic materials.

Synthesis of one-dimensional molecular arrays with tailored stereoisomers is
challenging yet has a great potential for application in molecular opto-,
electronic- and magnetic-devices, where the local array structure plays a
decisive role in the functional properties. Here, we demonstrate construction
and characterization of dehydroazulene isomer and diradical units in
three-dimensional organometallic compounds on Ag(111) with a combination of
low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory
calculations. Tip-induced voltage pulses firstly result in the formation of a
diradical species via successive homolytic fission of two C-Br bonds in the
naphthyl groups, which are subsequently transformed into chiral dehydroazulene
moieties. The delicate balance of the reaction rates among the diradical and
two stereoisomers, arising from an in-line configuration of tip and molecular
unit, allows directional azulene-to-azulene and azulene-to-diradical local
probe isomerization in a controlled manner. Furthermore, we found that the
diradical moiety hosts an open-shell singlet with antiferromagnetic coupling
between the unpaired electrons, which can undergo an inelastic spin transition
of 91 meV to the ferromagnetically coupled triplet state.

We numerically and analytically investigate the behavior of a non-equilibrium
phase transition in the second Schl\"ogl autocatalytic reaction scheme. Our
model incorporates both an interaction-induced phase separation and a
bifurcation in the reaction kinetics, with these critical lines coalescing at a
bicritical point in the macroscopic limit. We construct a stochastic master
equation for the reaction processes to account for the presence of mutual
particle interactions in a thermodynamically consistent manner by imposing a
generalized detailed balance condition, which leads to exponential corrections
for the transition rates. In a non-spatially extended (zero-dimensional)
setting, we treat the interactions in a mean-field approximation, and introduce
a minimal model that encodes the physical behavior of the bicritical point and
permits the exact evaluation of the anomalous scaling for the particle number
fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit. We obtain that the system size scaling
exponent for the particle number variance changes from $\beta_0 = 3/2$ at the
standard non-interacting bifurcation to $\beta = 12/7$ at the interacting
bicritical point. The methodology developed here provides a generic route for
the quantitative analysis of fluctuation effects in chemical reactions
occurring in multi-component interacting systems.

The internal structure of adhesive tapes determines the effective mechanical
properties. This holds true especially for blended systems, here consisting of
acrylate and rubber phases. In this note, we propose a lattice-based model to
study numerically the formation of internal morphologies within a
four-component mixture (of discrete particles) where the solvent components
evaporate. Mimicking numerically the interaction between rubber, acrylate, and
two different types of solvents, relevant for the technology of adhesive tapes,
we aim to obtain realistic distributions of rubber ball-shaped morphologies --
they play a key role in the overall functionality of those special adhesives.
Our model incorporates the evaporation of both solvents and allows for tuning
the strength of two essentially different solvent-solute interactions and of
the temperature of the system.

Informed by an abstraction of Kohn-Sham computation called a KS machine, a
functional analytic perspective is developed on mathematical aspects of density
functional theory. A natural semantics for the machine is bivariate, consisting
of a sequence of potentials paired with a ground density. Although the question
of when the KS machine can converge to a solution (where the potential
component matches a designated target) is not resolved here, a number of
related ones are. For instance: Can the machine progress toward a solution?
Barring presumably exceptional circumstances, yes in an energetic sense, but
using a potential-mixing scheme rather than the usual density-mixing variety.
Are energetic and function space distance notions of proximity-to-solution
commensurate? Yes, to a significant degree. If the potential components of a
sequence of ground pairs converges to a target density, do the density
components cluster on ground densities thereof? Yes, barring particle number
drifting to infinity.

The vortex dynamics in the spin-triplet superconductor, UTe$_2$, are studied
by measuring the DC electrical resistivity with currents along the $a$-axis
under magnetic fields along the $b$-axis. Surprisingly, we have discovered an
island region of low critical current deep inside the superconducting (SC)
state, well below the SC upper critical field, attributed to a weakening of
vortex pinning. Notably, this region coincides with the recently proposed
intermediate-field SC state. We discuss the possibility of nonsingular vortices
in the intermediate state, where SC order parameter does not vanish entirely in
the vortex cores due to the mixing of multiple SC components.

Spinel chromites ACr$_2$O$_4$ with inherent magnetic geometrical frustration
usually exhibit a noncollinear ferrimagnetic ground state when A are magnetic
ions, with possibly crystallite-size dependent intriguing magnetic features.
Here, we report single-domain magnetic properties of ACr$_2$O$_4$ (A = Ni, Co,
and Mn) nanocrystals, with an average crystallite size of 18, 15 and 10 nm,
exhibiting an optical energy gap of 2.87, 3.05 and 2.9 eV, respectively. The
temperature dependence of magnetization indicates the main bulk magnetic
transitions with a commonly coexisting spin-glass-like state and finite-size
effects on the noncolinear ferrimagnetic transitions. An anomaly observed at Ts
= 15, 24 and 10 K is attributed to the bulk magnetic transition to a canted
antiferromagnetic state in NiCr$_2$O$_4$ and incommensurate spiral orders in
CoCr$_2$O$_4$ and MnCr$_2$O$_4$ NCs, respectively. A further bulk magnetic
transition to a commensurate spiral order is observed for CoCr$_2$O$_4$ NCs at
a lock-in temperature Tl = 5 K much lower than that reported using bulk
samples, while it is completely suppressed in the MnCr$_2$O$_4$ NCs.
Finite-size effects and single-domain magnetic behaviors indicated by anomalous
temperature-dependences of the coercive field and the hysteresis-loop
squareness, mainly driven by a magnetocrystalline anisotropy, are discussed in
comparison to results reported using bulk counterparts.

Cadmium selenide (CdSe) is an inorganic semiconductor with unique optical and
electronic properties that made it useful in various applications, including
solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and biofluorescent tagging. In order to
synthesize high-quality crystals and subsequently integrate them into devices,
it is crucial to understand the atomic scale crystallization mechanism of CdSe.
Unfortunately, such studies are still absent in the literature.To overcome this
limitation, we employed an enhanced sampling-accelerated active learning
approach to construct a deep neural potential with ab initio accuracy for
studying the crystallization of CdSe.Our brute-force molecular dynamics
simulations revealed that a spherical-like nucleus formed spontaneously and
stochastically, resulting in a stacking disordered structure where the
competition between hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc blende polymorphs is
temperature-dependent. We found that pure hexagonal crystal can only be
obtained approximately above 1430 K, which is 35 K below its melting
temperature. We observed that the solidification dynamics of Cd and Se atoms
were distinct due to their different diffusion coefficients. The solidification
process was initiated by lower mobile Se atoms forming tetrahedral frameworks,
followed by Cd atoms occupying these tetrahedral centers and settling down
until the third-shell neighbor of Se atoms sited on their lattice positions.
Therefore, the medium-range ordering of Se atoms governs the crystallization
process of CdSe. Our findings indicate that understanding the complex dynamical
process is the key to comprehending the crystallization mechanism of compounds
like CdSe, and can shed lights in the synthesis of high-quality crystals.

Topologically protected spin textures, such as skyrmions1,2 and vortices3,4,
are robust against perturbations, serving as the building blocks for a range of
topological devices5-9. In order to implement these topological devices, it is
necessary to find ultra-small topological spin textures at room temperature,
because small size implies the higher topological charge density, stronger
signal of topological transport10,11 and the higher memory density or
integration for topological quantum devices5-9. However, finding ultra-small
topological spin textures at high temperatures is still a great challenge up to
now. Here we find ultra-small topological spin textures in Fe78Si9B13 amorphous
alloy. We measured a large topological Hall effect (THE) up to above room
temperature, indicating the existence of highly densed and ultra-small
topological spin textures in the samples. Further measurements by small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) reveal that the average size of ultra-small magnetic
texture is around 1.3nm. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that such ultra-small
spin texture is topologically equivalent to skyrmions, which originate from
competing frustration and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction12,13 coming from
amorphous structure14-17. Taking a single topological spin texture as one bit
and ignoring the distance between them, we evaluated the ideal memory density
of Fe78Si9B13, which reaches up to 4.44*104 gigabits (43.4 TB) per in2 and is 2
times of the value of GdRu2Si218 at 5K. More important, such high memory
density can be obtained at above room temperature, which is 4 orders of
magnitude larger than the value of other materials at the same temperature.
These findings provide a unique candidate for magnetic memory devices with
ultra-high density.

We report on efficient spin current generation at room temperature in rutile
type WO_2 grown on Al_2O_3(0001) substrate. The optimal WO_2 film has
(010)-oriented monoclinically distorted rutile structure with metallic
conductivity due to 5d^2 electrons, as characterized by x-ray diffraction,
electronic transport, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. By conducting
harmonic Hall measurement in Ni_{81}Fe_{19}/WO_2 bilayer, we estimate two
symmetries of the spin-orbit torque (SOT), i.e., dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike
ones to find that the former is larger than the latter. By comparison with the
Ni_{81}Fe_{19}/W control sample, the observed DL SOT efficiency \xi_{DL} of
WO_2 (+0.174) is about two thirds of that of W (-0.281) in magnitude, with a
striking difference in their signs. The magnitude of the \xi_{DL} of WO_2
exhibits comparable value to those of widely reported Pt and Ta, and Ir oxide
IrO_2. The positive sign of the \xi_{DL} of WO_2 can be explained by the
preceding theoretical study based on the 4d oxides. These results highlight
that the epitaxial WO_2 offers a great opportunity of rutile oxides with
spintronic functionalities, leading to future spin-orbit torque-controlled
devices.

A novel family of 1D lattice structures is proposed, where linearly varying
patches (LVPs) are linked by inlaid sites. We analytically show such structures
have strong spatial correlations. With nearest-neighbour tight-binding models,
we find at low on-site potentials, extended states present at some discrete
resonance levels. Interestingly, such levels come from energies of effective
LPVs with high frequency of occurrences (RFOs). As on-site potentials increase,
delocalization-localization transitions first happen for states related to
relative low RFOs, then that to relative high RFOs, and at last that to the
highest RFOs.

<h3>Nonequilibrium steady-state of trapped active particles</h3>

We consider an overdamped particle with a general physical mechanism that
creates noisy active movement (e.g., a run-and-tumble particle or active
Brownian particle etc.), that is confined by an external potential. Focusing on
the limit in which the correlation time $\tau$ of the active noise is small, we
find the nonequilibrium steady-state distribution
$P_{\text{st}}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)$ of the particle's position $\mathbf{X}$.
While typical fluctuations of $\mathbf{X}$ follow a Boltzmann distribution with
an effective temperature that is not difficult to found, the tails of
$P_{\text{st}}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)$ deviate from a Boltzmann behavior: In
the limit $\tau \to 0$, they scale as $P_{\text{st}}\left(\mathbf{X}\right)\sim
e^{-s\left(\mathbf{X}\right)/\tau}$. We calculate the large-deviation function
$s\left(\mathbf{X}\right)$ exactly for arbitrary trapping potential and active
noise in dimension $d=1$, by relating it to the rate function that describes
large deviations of the position of the same active particle in absence of an
external potential at long times. We then extend our results to $d>1$ assuming
rotational symmetry.

The colloidal 2D materials based on graphene and its modifications are of
great interest when it comes to forming LC phases. These LC phases allow
controlling the orientational order of colloidal particles, paving the way for
the efficient processing of modified graphene with anisotropic properties.
Here, we present the peculiarities of AA functionalization of GO, along with
the formation of its LC phase and orientational behavior in an external
magnetic field. We discuss the influence of pH on the GOLC, ultimately showing
its pH-dependent behavior for GO-AA complexes. In addition, we observe
different GO morphology changes due to the presence of AA functional groups,
namely L-cysteine dimerization on the GO platform. The pH dependency of
AA-functionalized LC phase of GO is examined for the first time. We believe
that our studies will open new possibilities for applications in
bionanotechnologies due to self-assembling properties of LCs and magnificent
properties of GO.

<br>
<br>
With the discovery of various matter wave solitons in spin-orbit-coupled
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), exploring their properties has become
increasingly significant. We mainly study stationary and moving bright solitons
in spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 BECs with or without a Zeeman field. The bright
solitons correspond to the plane wave (PW) and standing wave (SW) phases. With
the assistance of single-particle energy spectrum, we obtain the existence
domains of PW and SW solitons by analytical and numerical methods. The results
indicate that the interaction between atoms is also a key factor determining
the existence of solitons. In addition, we systematically discuss the stability
domains of PW and SW solitons, and investigate the impact of different
parameters on the stability domains. We find that PW solitons are unstable when
the linear Zeeman effect reaches a certain threshold, and the threshold is
determined by other parameters. The linear Zeeman effect also leads to the
alternating distribution of stable and unstable areas of SW solitons, and makes
SW solitons stably exist in the area with stronger ferromagnetism. Finally, we
analyze the collision dynamics of different types of stable solitons.

We determine the phase diagram of DNA with inter- and intra-strand
native-pair interactions that mimic the compaction of DNA. We show that DNA
takes an overall sheet-like structure in the region where an incipient
transition to a compact phase would have occurred. The stability of this phase
is due to the extra entropy from the folding of the sheet, which is absent in
the remaining polymer-like states of the phase diagram.

We study the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics of dipolar polarons, i.e.,
impurities immersed in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, after a quench of
the impurity-boson interaction. We show that the dipolar nature of the
condensate and of the impurity results in anisotropic relaxation dynamics, in
particular, anisotropic dressing of the polaron. More relevantly for cold-atom
setups, quench dynamics is strongly affected by the interplay between dipolar
anisotropy and trap geometry. Our findings pave the way for simulating
impurities in anisotropic media utilizing experiments with dipolar mixtures.

Building on the development of momentum state lattices (MSLs) over the past
decade, we introduce a simple extension of this technique to higher dimensions.
Based on the selective addressing of unique Bragg resonances in matter-wave
systems, MSLs have enabled the realization of tight-binding models with tunable
disorder, gauge fields, non-Hermiticity, and other features. Here, we examine
and outline an experimental approach to building scalable and tunable
tight-binding models in two dimensions describing the laser-driven dynamics of
atoms in momentum space. Using numerical simulations, we highlight some of the
simplest models and types of phenomena this system is well-suited to address,
including flat-band models with kinetic frustration and flux lattices
supporting topological boundary states. Finally, we discuss many of the direct
extensions to this model, including the introduction of disorder and
non-Hermiticity, which will enable the exploration of new transport and
localization phenomena in higher dimensions.

Symmetry-breaking electronic phase in unconventional high-temperature
(high-Tc) superconductors is a fascinating issue in condensed-matter physics,
among which the most attractive phases are charge density wave (CDW) phase with
four unit-cell periodicity in cuprates and nematic phase breaking the C4
rotational symmetry in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). Recently, pair
density wave (PDW), an exotic superconducting phase with non-zero momentum
Cooper pairs, has been observed in high-Tc cuprates and the monolayer FeSC.
However, the interplay between the CDW, PDW and nematic phase remains to be
explored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we detected
commensurate CDW and CDW-induced PDW orders with the same period of lambda =
4aFe (aFe is the distance between neighboring Fe atoms) in a monolayer high-Tc
Fe(Te,Se) film grown on SrTiO3(001) substrate. Further analyses demonstrate the
observed CDW is a smectic order, which breaks both translation and C4
rotational symmetry. Moreover, the smecticity of the CDW order is strongest
near the superconducting gap but weakens near defects and in an applied
magnetic field, indicating the interplay between the smectic CDW and PDW
orders. Our works provide a new platform to study the intertwined orders and
their interactions in high-Tc superconductors.

Two-dimensional materials provide remarkable platforms to uncover intriguing
quantum phenomena and develop nanoscale devices of versatile applications.
Recently, AlSb in the double-layer honeycomb (DLHC) structure was successfully
synthesized exhibiting a semiconducting nature [ACS Nano 15, 8184 (2021)],
which corroborates the preceding theoretical predictions and stimulates the
exploration of new robust DLHC materials. In this work, we propose a Janus DLHC
monolayer Al$_2$SbBi, the dynamical, thermal, and mechanical stabilities of
which are confirmed by first-principles calculations. Monolayer Al$_2$SbBi is
found to be a nontrivial topological insulator with a gap of about 0.2 eV,
which presents large spin splitting and peculiar spin texture in the valence
bands. Furthermore, due to the absence of inversion symmetry, monolayer
Al$_2$SbBi exhibits piezoelectricity and the piezoelectric strain coefficients
d$_{11}$ and d$_{31}$ are calculated to be 7.97 pm/V and 0.33 pm/V,
respectively, which are comparable to and even larger than those of many
piezoelectric materials. Our study suggests that monolayer Al$_2$SbBi has
potential applications in spintronic and piezoelectric devices.

<h3>Structure and composition tunable superconductivity, band topology and  elastic response of hard binary niobium nitrides Nb$_2$N, Nb$_4$N$_3$ and  Nb$_4$N$_5$</h3>

We perform a systematic \textit{ab initio} density functional study of the
superconductivity, electronic and phononic band structures, electron-phonon
coupling and elastic constants of all four possible structures of niobium
nitride $\beta$-Nb$_2$N as well as Nb-rich $\gamma$-Nb$_4$N$_3$ and N-rich
$\beta^\prime$-Nb$_4$N$_5$. First of all, we find that all four structures of
$\beta$-Nb$_2$N are superconductors with superconducting transition
temperatures ($T_c$) ranging from 0.6 K to 6.1 K, depending on the structure.
This explains why previous experiments reported contradicting $T_c$ values for
$\beta$-Nb$_2$N. Furthermore, both $\gamma$-Nb$_4$N$_3$ and
$\beta^\prime$-Nb$_4$N$_5$ are predicted to be superconductors with rather high
$T_c$ of 8.5 K and 15.3 K, respectively. Second, the calculated elastic
constants and phonon dispersion relations show that all the considered niobium
nitride structures are mechanically and dynamically stable. Moreover, the
calculated elastic moduli demonstrate that all the niobium nitrides are hard
materials with bulk moduli and hardness being comparable to or larger than the
well-known hard sapphire. Third, the calculated band structures reveal that the
nitrides possess both type I and type II Dirac nodal points and are thus
topological metals. Finally, the calculated electron-phonon coupling strength,
superconductivity and mechanical property of the niobium nitrides are discussed
in terms of their underlying electronic structures and also Debye temperatures.
The present \textit{ab initio} study thus indicates that $\beta$-Nb$_2$N,
$\gamma$-Nb$_4$N$_3$ and $\beta^\prime$-Nb$_4$N$_5$ are hard superconductors
with nontrivial band topology and are promising materials for exploring exotic
phenomena due to the interplay of hardness, superconductivity and nontrivial
band topology.

<h3>Dissipation bounds asymmetry of finite-time cross-correlations</h3>

<i>Tan Van Vu, Van Tuan Vo, Keiji Saito</i>
<br>

Recent studies have revealed an intimate connection between the asymmetry of
cross-correlations and thermodynamic quantities in the short-time limit. In the
finite-time regime, however, this relationship remains poorly understood. In
this Letter, we comprehensively examine this issue and provide an affirmative
resolution. Focusing on Markovian dynamics, we show that the asymmetry observed
in finite-time cross-correlations is always upper bounded by dissipation.
Precisely, we prove that, for systems in a steady state with arbitrary
operational durations, the asymmetry exhibits, at most, linear growth over
time, with the growth speed determined by the rates of entropy production and
dynamical activity. In the long-time regime, the asymmetry exhibits exponential
decay, with the decay rate dictated by the spectral gap of the transition
matrix. Furthermore, we generalize the short-time bounds on correlation
asymmetry, as reported by Shiraishi [arXiv:2304.12775] and Ohga et
al.~[arXiv:2303.13116], to encompass finite-time scenarios. These findings
offer novel insights into the thermodynamic aspects of correlation asymmetry.

The robustness of the chiral surface current of chiral superconductors
against surface roughness is studied utilizing the quasiclassical Eilenberger
theory. We consider the general chiral superconductors where the pair potential
is given by the spherical harmonics $Y_l^m$ such that $(l,m)=(1, \pm1)$ state
corresponds to an ($p_x \pm ip_y$)-wave superconductor. The self-consistent
calculations demonstrate that the robustness of the chiral current is
determined by whether subdominant $s$-wave Cooper pairs are induced by
disorder. The induced $s$-wave pairs act as an effective pair potential. As a
result, the spontaneous chiral current of ($p_x+ip_y$)- and
($d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$)-wave superconductors are robust against the roughness
because the subdominant $s$-wave Cooper pairs are present.

Despite the enormous theoretical and application interests, a fundamental
understanding of the glassy dynamics remains elusive. The static properties of
glassy and ordinary liquids are similar, but their dynamics are dramatically
different. What leads to this difference is the central puzzle of the field.
Even the primary defining glassy characteristics, their implications, and if
they are related to a single mechanism remain unclear. This lack of clarity is
a severe hindrance to theoretical progress. Here, we combine analytical
arguments and simulations of various systems in different dimensions and
address these questions. Our results suggest that the myriad of glassy features
are manifestations of two distinct mechanisms. Particle caging controls the
mean, and coexisting slow- and fast-moving regions govern the distribution of
particle displacements. All the other glassy characteristics are manifestations
of these two mechanisms; thus, the Fickian yet non-Gaussian nature of glassy
liquids is not surprising. Our results have crucial implications on how the
glassy dynamics data are analyzed, challenge some recent suggestions on the
mechanisms governing gassy dynamics, and impose strict constraints that a
correct theory of glasses must have.

<br>
<br>
We studied the single-particle momentum distribution of mass-imbalanced
Efimov states embedded in noninteger dimensions. The contact parameters, which
can be related to the thermodynamic properties of the gas, were calculated from
the high momentum tail of the single particle densities. We studied the
dependence of the contact parameters with the progressive change of the
noninteger dimension, ranging from three (D=3) to two (D=2) dimensions. Within
this interval, we move from the (D=3) regime where the Efimov discrete scale
symmetry drives the physics, until close to the critical dimension, which
depends on the mass imbalance, where the continuum scale symmetry takes place.
We found that the two- and three-body contacts grow significantly in magnitude
with the decrease of the noninteger dimension towards the critical dimension,
impacting observables of resonantly interacting trapped Bose gases.

<br>
<br>
Theoretical and experimental studies have verified the existence of ``magic
angles'' in twisted bilayer graphene, where the twist between layers gives rise
to flat bands and consequently highly correlated phases. Narrow bands can also
exist in multilayers with alternating twist angles, and recent theoretical work
suggests that they can also be found in trilayers with twist angles between
neighboring layers in the same direction. We show here that flat bands exist in
a variety of multilayers where the ratio between twist angles is close to
coprime integers. We generalize previous analyses, and, using the chiral limit
for interlayer coupling, give examples of many combinations of twist angles in
stacks made up of three and four layers which lead to flat bands. The technique
we use can be extended to systems with many layers. Our results suggest that
flat bands can exist in graphene multilayers with angle disorder, that is,
narrow samples of turbostatic graphite.

Within a strongly interacting Fermi liquid framework, we calculate the
effects of the Zeeman energy $\omega_H$ for a finite magnetic field, in a
metallic system with a van Hove peak in the density of states, located close to
and below the Fermi surface. We find that the chemical potential increases with
the square of $\omega_H$. We obtain a characteristic quasiparticle scattering
rate linear in the maximum of $\omega_H$ and temperature, both in the normal
and the d-wave superconducting state. We predict that ARPES experiments should
be able to elucidate this behavior of the scattering rate, and in particular,
the difference between spin up and down electrons.

<h3>Low temperature phase transitions under CDW state in kagome metals  AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K): Significance of mix-type Fermi surface electron  correlations</h3>

<br>
<br>
To understand the multistage phase transitions in V-based kagome metals
inside the charge-density-wave (CDW) state, we focus on the impact of the
"mix-type" Fermi surface because it is intact in the CDW state on the
"pure-type" Fermi surface. On the mix-type Fermi surface, moderate spin
correlations develop, and we reveal that uniform (q=0) bond order is caused by
the paramagnon interference mechanism, which is described by the
Aslamazov-Larkin vertex correction. The most dominant solution is the
E2g-symmetry nematic order, in which the director can be rotated arbitrarily.
In addition, we obtain the A1g-symmetry non-nematic order, which leads to the
change in the volume. These results are useful to understand the multistage
phase transitions inside the $2\times2$ CDW phase. The present theory has a
general significance because mix-type band structure is universally present in
kagome lattice tight-binding models.

Kagome metals present a fascinating platform of novel quantum phases thanks
to the interplay between the geometric frustration and strong electron
correlation. Here, we propose the emergence of the odd-parity bond-order state
that is closely tied to the intra-unit-cell odd-parity configuration (or
electric toroidal order) in recently discovered kagome metal CsTi3Bi5.The
predicted E1u bond-order is induced by the beyond-mean-field mechanism, that
is, the quantum interference among different sublattice spin fluctuations.
Importantly, the accompanied nematic deformation of the Fermi surface is very
small, while the intensity of the quasiparticle interference signal exhibits
large nematic anisotropy, consistently with the scanning tunneling microscope
measurements in CsTi3Bi5. The present odd-parity order triggers interesting
emergent phenomena, such as the Edelstein effect and reciprocal transport with
finite spin-orbit interaction.

Molecular crystals are a flexible platform to induce novel electronic phases.
Due to the weak forces between molecules, intermolecular distances can be
varied over relatively larger ranges than interatomic distances in atomic
crystals. On the other hand, the hopping terms are generally small, which
results in narrow bands, strong correlations and heavy electrons. Here, by
growing K$_x$C$_{60}$ fullerides on hexagonal layered Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we show
that upon doping the series undergoes a Mott transition from a molecular
insulator to a correlated metal, and an in-gap state evolves into highly
dispersive Dirac-like fermions at half filling, where superconductivity occurs.
This picture challenges the commonly accepted description of the low energy
quasiparticles as appearing from a gradual electron doping of the conduction
states, and suggests an intriguing parallel with the more famous family of the
cuprate superconductors. More in general, it indicates that molecular crystals
offer a viable route to engineer electron-electron interactions.

In 1973, Philip Anderson published a paper introducing the resonating valence
bond state, which can be recognized in retrospect as a topologically ordered
phase of matter - one that cannot be classified in the conventional way
according to its patterns of spontaneously broken symmetry. Steven Kivelson and
Shivaji Sondhi reflect on the impact of this paper over the past 50 years.

<h3>Quantum impurity with 2/3 local moment in 1D quantum wires: an NRG study</h3>

We study a Kondo state that is strongly influenced by its proximity to an
w^-1/2 singularity in the metallic host density of states. This singularity
occurs at the bottom of the band of a 1D chain, for example. We first analyze
the non-interacting system: A resonant state e_d, located close to the band
singularity, suffers a strong `renormalization', such that a bound state is
created below the bottom of the band in addition to a resonance in the
continuum. When e_d is positioned right at the singularity, the spectral weight
of the bound state is 2/3, irrespective of its coupling to the conduction
electrons. The interacting system is modeled using the Single Impurity Anderson
Model, which is then solved using the Numerical Renormalization Group method.
We observe that the Hubbard interaction causes the bound state to suffer a
series of transformations, including level splitting, transfer of spectral
weight, appearance of a spectral discontinuity, changes in binding energy (the
lowest state moves farther away from the bottom of the band), and development
of a finite width. When e_d is away from the singularity and in the
intermediate valence regime, the impurity occupancy is lower. As e_d moves
closer to the singularity, the system partially recovers Kondo regime
properties, i.e., higher occupancy and lower Kondo temperature T_K. The
impurity thermodynamic properties show that the local moment fixed point is
also strongly affected by the existence of the bound state. When e_d is close
to the singularity, the local moment fixed point becomes impervious to charge
fluctuations (caused by bringing e_d close to the Fermi energy), in contrast to
the local moment suppression that occurs when e_d is away from the singularity.
We also discuss an experimental implementation that shows similar results to
the quantum wire, if the impurity's metallic host is an armchair graphene
nanoribbon.

We study the delta-chain with spin-$1$ on basal sites and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
on apical sites. The Heisenberg interaction between neighbor basal spins is
antiferromagnetic (AF) and the interaction between basal and apical spins is
ferromagnetic (F). We show that the magnetization curve of this model is the
same as that of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ kagome-like chain with competing
Heisenberg interactions. The ground state phase diagram of the latter as a
function of the ratio between the AF and F interaction, $\alpha $, consists of
the ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and singlet phases. We study the magnetic
properties in each ground state phase and analyze the magnetization curves. We
show that there are magnetization plateaus and jumps in definite regions of
value $\alpha$. We compare the magnetic properties of considered models with
those of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ delta chain.

We present a systematic study of the nonlinear thermal Hall responses in
bosonic systems using the quantum kinetic theory framework. We demonstrate the
existence of an intrinsic nonlinear boson thermal current, arising from the
quantum metric which is a wavefunction dependent band geometric quantity. In
contrast to the nonlinear Drude and nonlinear anomalous Hall contributions, the
intrinsic nonlinear thermal conductivity is independent of the scattering
timescale. We demonstrate the dominance of this intrinsic thermal Hall response
in topological magnons in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice
without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our findings highlight the
significance of band geometry induced nonlinear thermal transport and motivate
experimental probe of the intrinsic nonlinear thermal Hall response with
implications for quantum magnonics.

The dynamical scaling and ageing in the relaxational dynamics of the quenched
directed spherical model is analysed. The exact two-time correlation and
resposne functions display new regimes of ballistic or anisotropic ballistic
scaling, at larger distance than probed in the usual regime of diffusive
scaling. The r\^ole of long-ranged initial correlations on the existence of
these scaling regimes is clarified. Their dynamical symmetries are described in
terms of recent biased extensions of the Schr\"odinger algebra in that the
anisotropic ballistic scaling regime can be interpreted in terms of
meta-Schr\"odinger invariance while the regime of isotropic ballistic scaling
is meta-conformally invariant.

The effect of inclusion of the planar phonon anisotropy on thermo-electrical
behavior of graphene is analyzed. Charge transport is simulated by means of
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo technique coupled with numerical solution of the
phonon Boltzmann equations based on deterministic methods.
The definition of the crystal lattice local equilibrium temperature is
investigated as well and the results furnish possible alternative approaches to
identify it starting from measurements of electric current density, with
relevant experimental advantages, which could help to overcome the present
difficulties regarding thermal investigation of graphene.
Positive implications are expected for many applications, as the field of
electronic devices, which needs a coherent tool for simulation of charge and
hot phonon transport; the correct definition of the local equilibrium
temperature is in turn fundamental for the study, design and prototyping of
cooling mechanisms for graphene-based devices.

<h3>Dynamics of an Exciton-phonon Triangle under Photoirradiation</h3>

Herein, the dynamics of excitons coupled with optical phonons in a triangular
system is numerically studied. By representing the excitons by quasi-spin
states, the similarity between the chiral spin states and the exciton chiral
states is discussed. In particular, the optical control of excitons is
discussed, where photoirradiation causes the switching of the exciton states on
the ultrafast time scale by Raman scattering. A phase diagram is obtained based
on the ground-state properties of the system determined by the magnitudes of
the exciton-phonon interactions and exciton transfer energy. By varying the
frequency and/or intensity of light, a transition between exciton-phonon
composite states is induced, which suggests the possibility of the coherent
control of the chiral properties of excitonic systems via phonon excitation.

The realization of quantum gates in topological quantum computation still
confronts significant challenges in both fundamental and practical aspects.
Here, we propose a deterministic and fully topologically protected
measurement-based scheme to realize the issue of implementing Clifford quantum
gates on the Majorana qubits. Our scheme is based on rigorous proof that the
single-qubit gate can be performed by leveraging the neighboring Majorana qubit
but not disturbing its carried quantum information, eliminating the need for
ancillary Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological quantum computing.
Benefiting from the ancilla-free construction, we show the minimum measurement
sequences with four steps to achieve two-qubit Clifford gates by constructing
their geometric visualization. To avoid the uncertainty of the measurement-only
strategy, we propose manipulating the MZMs in their parameter space to correct
the undesired measurement outcomes while maintaining complete topological
protection, as demonstrated in a concrete Majorana platform. Our scheme
identifies the minimal operations of measurement-based topological and
deterministic Clifford gates and offers an ancilla-free design of topological
quantum computation.

First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Lu-H-N
compounds reveal low-energy configurations of Fm$\overline{3}$m
Lu$_{8}$H$_{23-x}$N structures that exhibit novel electronic properties such as
flat bands, sharply peaked densities of states (van Hove singularities), and
intersecting Dirac cones near the Fermi energy (E$_F$). These N-doped
LuH$_3$-based structures also exhibit an interconnected metallic hydrogen
network, which is a common feature of high-T$_c$ hydride superconductors.
Electronic property systematics give estimates of T$_c$ for optimally ordered
structures that are well above the critical temperatures predicted for
structures considered previously. The vHs and flat bands near E$_F$ are
enhanced in DFT+U calculations, implying strong correlation physics should also
be considered for first-principles studies of these materials. These results
provide a basis for understanding the novel electronic properties observed for
nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride.

<h3>Nanoscale visualization of the thermally-driven evolution of  antiferromagnetic domains in FeTe thin films</h3>

Antiferromagnetic order, being a ground state of a number of exotic quantum
materials, is of immense interest both from the fundamental physics perspective
and for driving potential technological applications. For a complete
understanding of antiferromagnetism in materials, nanoscale visualization of
antiferromagnetic domains, domain walls and their robustness to external
perturbations is highly desirable. Here, we synthesize antiferromagnetic FeTe
thin films using molecular beam epitaxy. We visualize local antiferromagnetic
ordering and domain formation using spin-polarized scanning tunneling
microscopy. From the atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy
topographs, we calculate local structural distortions to find a high
correlation with the distribution of the antiferromagnetic order. This is
consistent with the monoclinic structure in the antiferromagnetic state.
Interestingly, we observe a substantial domain wall change by small temperature
variations, unexpected for the low temperature changes used compared to the
much higher antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of FeTe. This is in contrast
to electronic nematic domains in the cousin FeSe multilayer films, where we
find no electronic or structural change within the same temperature range. Our
experiments provide the first atomic-scale imaging of perturbation-driven
magnetic domain evolution simultaneous with the ensuing structural response of
the system. The results reveal surprising thermally-driven modulations of
antiferromagnetic domains in FeTe thin films well below the Neel temperature.

The numerical determination of solitary states is an important topic for such
research areas as Bose-Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics, plasma physics,
etc. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for identifying solitons
based on dynamical solutions of real-time differential equations. Our approach
combines a machine-learning architecture called the complex-valued neural
operator (CNO) with an energy-restricted gradient optimization. The former
serves as a generalization of the traditional neural operator to the complex
domain, and constructs a smooth mapping between the initial and final states;
the latter facilitates the search for solitons by constraining the energy
space. We concretely demonstrate this approach on the quasi-one-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate with homogeneous and inhomogeneous nonlinearities. Our
work offers a new idea for data-driven effective modeling and studies of
solitary waves in nonlinear physical systems.

The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for rigid and saturated ferromagnets is
derived using a two-continuum model constructed by H.F. Tiersten for elastic
and saturated ferromagnets. The relevant basic laws of physics are applied
systematically to the two continua or their combination. The exchange
interaction is introduced into the model through surface distributed magnetic
couples. This leads to a continuum theory with magnetization gradients in the
stored energy density. The saturation condition of the magnetization functions
as constraints on the energy density and has implications in the constitutive
relations.

<h3>Accurate Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients and their Uncertainties  from Computer Simulation</h3>

Self-diffusion coefficients, $\D$, are routinely estimated from molecular
dynamics simulations by fitting a linear model to the observed mean-squared
displacements (MSDs) of mobile species. MSDs derived from simulation suffer
from statistical noise, which introduces uncertainty in the resulting estimate
of $D^*$. An optimal scheme for estimating $D^*$ will minimise this
uncertainty, i.e., will have high statistical efficiency, and will give an
accurate estimate of the uncertainty itself. We present a scheme for estimating
$D^*$ from a single simulation trajectory with high statistical efficiency and
accurately estimating the uncertainty in the predicted value. The statistical
distribution of MSDs observable from a given simulation is modelled as a
multivariate normal distribution using an analytical covariance matrix for an
equivalent system of freely diffusing particles, which we parameterise from the
available simulation data. We then perform Bayesian regression to sample the
distribution of linear models that are compatible with this model multivariate
normal distribution, to obtain a statistically efficient estimate of $D^*$ and
an accurate estimate of the associated statistical uncertainty.
