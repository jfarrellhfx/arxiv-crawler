<h3>Spin-polarization of topological crystalline and normal insulator  Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se (111) epilayers probed by photoelectron spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
The helical spin texture on the surface of topological crystalline insulators
(TCI) makes these materials attractive for application in spintronics. In this
work, spin-polarization and electronic structure of surface states of
(111)-oriented Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se TCI epitaxial films are examined by angle --
as well as spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SR-ARPES). High-quality
epilayers with various Sn content are grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
method. Topological-normal insulator transition manifesting itself as band gap
opening is observed. It is shown that the gap opening can be induced not only
by changing the Sn content of the epilayer but also depositing a transition
metal (TM) on its surface. In the latter case, the observed gaping of the
surface states is caused by change in surface composition and not by magnetism.
We also show that helical spin polarization is present not only for samples of
topological composition but also for trivial ones (with an open band gap). The
observed spin polarization reaches a value of 30 % for the in-plane spin
component and is almost absent for the out-of-plane one. We believe that our
work will pave the way for the application of surface states not only of
topological but also normal insulators based on lead-tin chalcogenides in
spin-charge conversion devices.

<h3>Conductance suppression due to two-stream instability in bilayer  graphene</h3>

We investigate the electron-hole two-stream instability (or Coulomb drag) in
intrinsic bilayer graphene in the hydrodynamic regime, accounting for the
effects of temperature, initial drift velocity, magnetic field, and collisions.
The threshold drift speed for the onset of instabilities is of the order of the
thermal velocity of the carriers. We put in evidence an unprecedented purely
electrostatic mechanism leading to current relaxation, giving rise to a
well-defined dc longitudinal conductivity $\propto T^{3/2}$. Due to competition
between electrostatic and collisional processes, two distinct transport regimes
are identified. An analysis on the Hall conductivity revealed that the
two-stream instability effects also correct the most recent results obtained
within the linear response theory.

<h3>A statistical mechanical model for crack growth</h3>

Analytic relations that describe crack growth are vital for modeling
experiments and building a theoretical understanding of fracture. Upon
constructing an idealized model system for the crack and applying the
principles of statistical thermodynamics, it is possible to formulate the rate
of thermally activated crack growth as a function of load, but the result is
analytically intractable. Here, an asymptotically correct theory is used to
obtain analytic approximations of the crack growth rate from the fundamental
theoretical formulation. These crack growth rate relations are compared to
those that exist in the literature and are validated with respect to Monte
Carlo calculations. The success of this overall approach is encouraging for
future modeling endeavors that might consider more complicated fracture
mechanisms, such as inhomogeneity or a reactive environment.

Quasiparticles and their interactions are a key part of our understanding of
quantum many-body systems. Quantum simulation experiments with cold atoms have
in recent years advanced our understanding of isolated quasiparticles, but so
far they have provided limited information regarding their interactions and
possible bound states. Here, we show how exploring mobile impurities immersed
in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a two-dimensional lattice can address
this problem. First, the spectral properties of individual impurities are
examined, and in addition to the attractive and repulsive polarons known from
continuum gases, we identify a new kind of quasiparticle stable for repulsive
boson-impurity interactions. The spatial properties of polarons are calculated
showing that there is an increased density of bosons at the site of the
impurity both for repulsive and attractive interactions. We then derive an
effective Schr\"odinger equation describing two polarons interacting via the
exchange of density oscillations in the BEC, which takes into account strong
impurity-boson two-body correlations. Using this, we show that the attractive
nature of the effective interaction between two polarons combined with the
two-dimensionality of the lattice leads to the formation of bound states - i.e.
bipolarons. The wave functions of the bipolarons are examined showing that the
ground state is symmetric under particle exchange and therefore relevant for
bosonic impurities, whereas the first excited state is doubly degenerate and
odd under particle exchange making it relevant for fermionic impurities. Our
results show that quantum gas microscopy in optical lattices is a promising
platform to explore the spatial properties of polarons as well as to finally
observe the elusive bipolarons.

<h3>Absolute negative mobility of an active tracer in a crowded environment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01216" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01216</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre Rizkallah, Alessandro Sarracino, Olivier Bénichou, Pierre Illien</i>
<br>
<br>
Absolute negative mobility (ANM) refers to the situation where the average
velocity of a driven tracer is opposite to the direction of the driving force.
This effect was evidenced in different models of nonequilibrium transport in
complex environments, whose description remains effective. Here, we provide a
microscopic theory for this phenomenon. We show that it emerges in the model of
an active tracer particle submitted to an external force, and evolving on a
discrete lattice populated with mobile passive crowders. Resorting to a
decoupling approximation, we compute analytically the velocity of the tracer
particle as a function of the different parameters of the system, and confront
our results to numerical simulations. We determine the range of parameters
where ANM can be observed, characterize the response of the environment to the
displacement of the tracer, and clarify the mechanism underlying ANM and its
relationship with negative differential mobility (another hallmark of driven
systems far from the linear response).

<h3>Circumferential buckling of a hydrogel tube emptying upon dehydration</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01240" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01240</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A cylindrical hydrogel tube, completely submerged in water, hydrates by
swelling and filling its internal cavity. When it comes back into contact with
air, it dehydrates: the tube thus expels the solvent through the walls,
shrinking. This dehydration process causes a depression in the tube cavity,
which can lead to circumferential buckling. Here we study the occurrence of
such buckling using a continuous model that combines non-linear elasticity with
Flory-Rehner theory, to take into account both the large deformations and the
active behavior of the hydrogel. In quasi-static approximation, we use the
incremental deformation formalism, extended to the chemo-mechanical equations,
to determine the threshold value of the enclosed volume at which buckling is
triggered. This critical value is found to depend on the shell thickness,
chemical potential and constitutive features. The results obtained are in good
agreement with the results of the finite element simulations of the complete
dynamic problem.

<h3>Frank-Read Mechanism in Nematic Liquid Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01316</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng Long, Matthew J. Deutsch, Joseph Angelo, Christopher Culbreath, Hiroshi Yokoyama, Jonathan V. Selinger, Robin L. B. Selinger</i>
<br>
<br>
In a crystalline solid under mechanical stress, a Frank-Read source is a
pinned dislocation segment that repeatedly bows and detaches, generating
concentric dislocation loops. We demonstrate that in nematic liquid crystals,
an analogous Frank-Read mechanism generates concentric disclination loops.
Using experiment, simulation, and theory, we study a disclination segment
pinned between surface defects on one substrate in a nematic cell. Under
applied twist of the nematic director, the pinned segment bows and emits a new
disclination loop which expands, leaving the original segment intact; loop
emission repeats for each additional 180$^\circ$ of applied twist. We present
experimental micrographs showing loop expansion and snap-off, numerical
simulations of loop emission under both quasistatic and dynamic loading, and
theoretical analysis considering both free energy minimization and the balance
of competing forces. Lastly, we discuss potential use of Frank-Read sources to
modify microstructural evolution in both passive and active nematics.

<h3>Comparison of Conformational Phase Behavior for Flexible and  Semiflexible Polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01347" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01347</a>
<br>
<i>Dilimulati Aierken, Michael Bachmann</i>
<br>
<br>
We employ the recently introduced generalized microcanonical inflection point
method for the statistical analysis of phase transitions in flexible and
semiflexible polymers and study the impact of the bending stiffness upon the
character and order of transitions between random-coil, globules, and
pseudocrystalline conformations. The high-accuracy estimates of the
microcanonical entropy and its derivatives required for this study were
obtained by extensive replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations. We observe that
the transition behavior into the compact phases changes qualitatively with
increasing bending stiffness. Whereas the $\Theta$ collapse transition is less
affected, the first-order liquid-solid transition characteristic for flexible
polymers ceases to exist once bending effects dominate over attractive
monomer-monomer interactions.

<h3>Magnetic and Electrical Properties of high-entropy rare-earth manganites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00819</a>
<br>
<i>Ashutosh Kumar, David Bérardan, Diana Dragoe, Eric Riviere, Tomohiro Takayama, Hidenori Takagi, Nita Dragoe</i>
<br>
<br>
Detailed investigations of structural, magnetic and electronic transport
properties of hole-doped high-entropy rare-earth manganites are presented. The
high-entropy samples (LaNdPrSmEu)$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$
(0$\leq$\textit{x}$\leq$0.5), synthesized using the solid-state technique, show
a change in the crystal structure from \textit{Pbnm} to \textit{R-3c} with
increasing Sr substitution, attributed to the change in the tolerance factor.
Prominent ferromagnetic ordering is observed in the sample with a rhombohedral
structure (\textit{x}$\geq$0.3), originating from the dominant double exchange
mechanism mediated by itinerant electrons. Further, the Curie temperature is
smaller for the high-entropy sample with \textit{x}=0.3, as compared to
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$, suggesting a strong relation between the Curie
temperature and the Mn-O-Mn bond angle associated with the reduced ionic radii
at the rare-earth site. The electrical resistivity of the high-entropy samples
is larger than those of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$, which can be ascribed to the
reduced bandwidth due to the enhanced structural distortion. A concomitant rise
in magnetoresistance is observed for high-entropy samples with the increase in
Sr concentration. These findings considering the configurational complexity of
different rare-earths advance the understanding of high-entropy rare earth
manganites.

<h3>Flattened and wrinkled encapsulated droplets: Shape-morphing induced by  gravity and evaporation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00826" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00826</a>

<br>
<br>
We report surprising morphological changes of suspension droplets (containing
class II hydrophobin protein HFBI from Trichoderma reesei and water) as they
evaporate with a contact line pinned on a rigid solid substrate. Both pendant
and sessile droplets display the formation of an encapsulating elastic film as
the bulk concentration of solute reaches a critical value during evaporation,
but the morphology of the droplet varies significantly: for sessile droplets,
the elastic film ultimately crumples in a nearly flattened area close to the
apex while in pendant droplets, circumferential wrinkling occurs close to the
contact line. These different morphologies are understood through a
gravito-elasto-capillary model that predicts the droplet morphology and the
onset of shape changes, as well as showing that the influence of the direction
of gravity remains crucial even for very small droplets (where the effect of
gravity can normally be neglected). The results pave the way to control droplet
shape in several engineering and biomedical applications.

<h3>Effective quasiclassical models for odd-frequency superconductivity:  energy-symmetry, preserved spectral weight, and Meissner response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00854" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00854</a>

<br>
<br>
The odd-frequency superconducting state appears generally in hybrid
structures consisting of conventional superconductors and other materials, and
features electrons that form temporally non-local Cooper pairs. The
quasiclassical theory of superconductivity has been extensively used to model
such systems, finding in many cases excellent agreement with experimental
measurements. Therefore, it is of interest to study effective models of
odd-frequency superconductivity to predict new phenomena associated with this
form of unconventional pairing. We establish necessary criteria that the
quasiclassical Green functions in odd-frequency superconducting systems in the
dirty limit must satisfy in order to be physically reasonable, including
conservation of spectral weight. We show that it is possible to write down
effective models which satisfy all the abovementioned criteria, but which still
predict different behavior when it comes to the density of states and the
magnetic response of the superconductor. For instance, an effective model for
the odd-frequency anomalous Green function that gives a conserved spectral
weight can yield either a peaked or gapped density of states at the Fermi
energy, and exhibit conventional, zero, or unconventional Meissner response.
This finding demonstrates the importance of carefully considering the
properties of effective models describing odd-frequency superconductivity in
order to obtain physically reasonable results.

<h3>Influence of silicon nanocone on cell membrane self-sealing capabilities  for targeted drug delivery -- computer simulation study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Efficient and non-invasive techniques of cargo delivery to biological cells
are the focus of biomedical research because of their great potential
importance for targeted drug therapy. Therefore, much effort is being made to
study the characteristics of using nano-based biocompatible materials as
systems that can facilitate this task while ensuring appropriate self-sealing
of the cell membrane. Here, we study the effects of indentation and withdrawal
of nanospear on phospholipid membrane by applying steered molecular dynamics
(SMD) technique. Our results show that the withdrawal process directly depends
on the initial position of the nanocone. The average force and work are
considerably more significant in case of the withdrawal starting from a larger
depth. This result is attributed to stronger hydrophobic interactions between
the nanocone and lipid tails of the membrane molecules. Furthermore, when the
indenter was started from the lower initial depth, the number of lipids removed
from the membrane was several times smaller than the deeper indentation. The
choice of the least invasive method for nanostructure-assisted drug delivery is
crucial for possible applications in medicine. Therefore, the results presented
in this work might be helpful in efficient and safe drug delivery with
nanomaterials.

<h3>Investigation of process history and phenomenology of plutonium oxides  using vector quantizing variational autoencoder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00887</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Accurate, high throughput, and unbiased analysis of plutonium oxide particles
is needed for analysis of the phenomenology associated with process parameters
in their synthesis. Compared to qualitative and taxonomic descriptors,
quantitative descriptors of particle morphology through scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) have shown success in analyzing process parameters of uranium
oxides. We utilize a VQ-VAE to quantitatively describe plutonium dioxide (PuO2)
particles created in a designed experiment and investigate their phenomenology
and prediction of their process parameters. PuO2 was calcined from Pu(III)
oxalates that were precipitated under varying synthetic conditions that related
to concentrations, temperature, addition and digestion times, precipitant feed,
and strike order; the surface morphology of the resulting PuO2 powders were
analyzed by SEM. A pipeline was developed to extract and quantify useful image
representations for individual particles with the VQ-VAE to perform multiple
classification tasks simultaneously. The reduced feature space could predict
process parameters with greater than 80% accuracies for some parameters with a
single particle. They also showed utility for grouping particles with similar
surface morphology characteristics together. Both the clustering and
classification results reveal valuable information regarding which chemical
process parameters chiefly influence the PuO2 particle morphologies: strike
order and oxalic acid feedstock. Doing the same analysis with multiple
particles was shown to improve the classification accuracy on each process
parameter over the use of a single particle, with statistically significant
results generally seen with as few as four particles in a sample.

<h3>Stabilizing $α-$helicity of polypeptide in aqueous urea: Dipole  orientation or hydrogen bonding?</h3>

<br>
Urea denatures proteins due to its strong tendency to dehydrate the first
solvation shell via urea-residue preferential binding. However, even after
extensive experimental and computational investigations, the influence of urea
on the stability of secondary structures remains elusive. For example, contrary
to the common understanding, experimental studies have indicated that specific
polypeptides, such as poly-alanine or alanine-rich systems, may even show an
improved tendency to form secondary structures in aqueous urea. We investigate
this seemingly counter-intuitive behaviour using over 15$\mu$s long all-atom
simulations. These results show how a delicate balance between the localized
dipole orientations and hydrogen bonding dictates polypeptide solvation in
aqueous urea. Our work establishes a structure-property relationship that
highlights the importance of microscopic dipole-dipole
orientations/interactions for the operational understanding of macroscopic
protein solvation.

<h3>Evolution of the surface states of the Luttinger semimetal under strain  and inversion-symmetry breaking: Dirac, line-node, and Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00902</a>
<br>
<i>Maxim Kharitonov, Julian-Benedikt Mayer, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz</i>
<br>
<br>
The Luttinger model of a quadratic-node semimetal for electrons with the
$j=\frac32$ angular momentum under cubic symmetry is the parent,
highest-symmetry low-energy model for a variety of topological and strongly
correlated materials, such as HgTe, $\alpha$-Sn, and iridate compounds.
Previously, we have theoretically demonstrated that the Luttinger semimetal
exhibits surface states. In the present work, we theoretically study the
evolution of these surface states under symmetry-lowering perturbations:
compressive strain and bulk-inversion asymmetry (BIA). This system is quite
special in that each consecutive perturbation creates a new type of a semimetal
phase, resulting in a sequence of four semimetal phases, where each successive
phase arises by modification of the nodal structure of the previous phase:
under compressive strain, the Luttinger semimetal turns into a Dirac semimetal,
which under the linear-in-momentum BIA term turns into a line-node semimetal,
which under the cubic-in-momentum BIA terms turns into a Weyl semimetal. We
calculate the surface states within the generalized Luttinger model for these
four semimetal phases within a ``semi-analytical'' approach and fully analyze
the corresponding evolution of the surface states. Importantly, for this
sequence of four semimetal phases, there is a corresponding hierarchy of the
low-energy models describing the vicinities of the nodes. We derive most of
these models and demonstrate quantitative asymptotic agreement between the
surface-state spectra of some of them. This proves that the mechanisms
responsible for the surface states are fully contained in the low-energy models
within their validity ranges, once they are supplemented with proper boundary
conditions, and demonstrates that continuum models are perfectly applicable for
studying surface states.

<br>
<br>
Disordered materials are attracting considerable attention because of their
enhanced properties compared to their ordered analogs, making them particularly
suitable for high-temperature applications. The feasibility of incorporating
these materials into new devices depends on a variety of thermophysical
properties. Among them, thermal expansion is critical to device stability,
especially in multi-component systems. Its calculation, however, is quite
challenging for materials with substitutional disorder, hindering computational
screenings. In this work, we introduce QH-POCC to leverage the local
tile-expansion of disorder. This method provides an effective partial partition
function to calculate thermomechanical properties of substitutionally
disordered compounds in the quasi-harmonic approximation. Two systems, AuCu3
and CdMg3, the latter a candidate for long-period superstructures at low
temperature, are used to validate the methodology by comparing the calculated
values of the coefficient of thermal expansion and isobaric heat capacity with
experiment, demonstrating that QH-POCC is a promising approach to study
thermomechanical properties of disordered systems.

<br>
<br>
Spin semimetals are a recently discovered new class of spintronic material,
which exhibit a band gap in one spin channel while a semimetalic feature in the
other and thus allow for tunable spin transport. Here, we present experimental
verification of spin semimetalic behavior in FeRhCrSi, a quaternary Heusler
alloy with saturation moment 2 $\mu_B$ and Curie temperature $>$ 400 K. It
crystallises in the L2$_1$ structure with 50$\%$ antisite disorder between Fe
and Rh. Below 300 K, it shows a weakly temperature dependent electrical
resistivity with negative temperature coefficient, indicating the semimetal or
spin semimetal behavior. Anomalous magnetoresistance data reveals dominant
contribution from asymmetric part, a clear signature of spin-valve nature,
which is retained even at room temperature. Hall measurements confirm the
anomalous nature of conductivity originating from the intrinsic Berry
curvature, with holes being the majority carriers. Ab-initio simulation
confirms a unique long-range ferrimagnetic ordering to be the ground state,
explaining the origin behind the unexpected low saturation moment. The
ferrimagnetic disordered structure confirms the spin semimetalic feature of
FeRhCrSi, as observed experimentally.

<h3>Superconductivity in a Magnetic Rashba Semimetal EuAuBi</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the observation of superconductivity with multiple magnetic
ordering and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling in a layered polar semimetal
EuAuBi. Magnetic transition is observed at 4 K, followed by a superconducting
transition at 2.2 K, which is sensitive to the crystal surface conditions. The
upper critical field Hc2 of 9.8 T for the out-of-plane field is three times
higher than that for the in-plane field, which can be associated with the
two-dimensional structure or the surface state. On the basis of
first-principles calculations, it is found that the characteristic Hc2 possibly
reflects the anisotropic modification of the Fermi surface by the effective
combination of Rashba-type spin splitting and Zeeman spin splitting enhanced by
Eu moments.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically-protected spin textures that manifest in
certain non-centrosymmetric ferromagnets under the right conditions of
temperature and field. In thin film skyrmion hosts, demagnetization effects
combined with geometric confinement can result in two distinct types of spin
textures: those with their axis of symmetry in the plane of the film (IP) and
those with their axis pointing out-of-plane (OOP). Here we present Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy evidence in conjunction with numerical
modeling showing a flop transition between IP and OOP skyrmions in
Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ at room temperature. We show that this skyrmion flop
transition is controllable via the angle of the external field relative to the
film normal and we illustrate how this transition depends on thickness.
Finally, we propose a skyrmion-writing device that utilizes the details of this
transition.

<h3>How does your gyroid grow?: A mesoatomic perspective on supramolecular,  soft matter network crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00938" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00938</a>
<br>
<i>Gregory M. Grason, Edwin L. Thomas</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a framework to understand supramolecular network crystals formed
in soft matter in terms of mesoatomic building blocks, collective groupings of
amphiphilic molecules that play a role analogous to atomic or molecular
subunits of hard matter crystals. While the concept of mesoatoms is intuitive
and widely invoked in crystalline arrangements of sphere- or cylinder-like
(micelle-like) domains, analogous notions of physically meaningful building
blocks of triply periodic network crystals, like the double-gyroid or
double-diamond structures are obscured by the complex, bicontinuous domain
shapes and intercatenated topologies of the double networks. Focusing on the
example of diblock copolymer melts, we propose generic rules for decomposing
triply-periodic network crystals into a unique set of mesoatomic building
blocks, leading to mesoatomic volumes that are non-convex and bound by smoothly
curved faces, unlike the more familiar polyhedral shapes associated with
sphere- and cylinder-like mesoatoms. We analyze the shapes of these mesoatoms,
their internal structure and importantly their local packing with neighbor
mesoatomic units. Hypothesizing that mesoatoms are kinetically favored
intermediate structures whose local shapes and packing template network crystal
assembly on long time scales, we propose and study a minimal energetic model of
mesoatom assembly for three different cubic double-network crystals, which
predicts a detailed picture for kinetics of intercatenation and surface growth.
We discuss potential extensions and elaborations of the mesoatomic description
of supramolecular soft matter network crystals, experimental observations of
malleable mesoatomic units in the precursor sponge phase as well as in ordered
cubic networks, as well as possibilities for observing mesoatoms in primordial,
pre-crystalline states.

<h3>Nonadiabatic to Adiabatic Transition of Electron Transfer in Colloidal  Quantum Dot Molecules</h3>

Electron transfer is an important and fundamental process in chemistry,
biology and physics, and has received significant attention in recent years.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing questions concerns with the realization of
the transitions between nonadiabatic and adiabatic regimes of electron
transfer, as the coupling (hybridization) energy, $J$, between the donor and
acceptor is varied. Here, using colloidal quantum dot molecules, a new class of
coupled quantum dot dimers, we computationally demonstrate how the
hybridization energy between the donor and acceptor quantum dots can be tuned
by simply changing the neck dimensions and/or the quantum dot size. This
provides a handle to tune the electron transfer from the nonadiabatic
over-damped Marcus regime to the coherent adiabatic regime in a single system,
without changing the reorganization energy, $\lambda$, or the typical phonon
frequency, $\omega_c$. We develop an atomistic model to account for several
donor and acceptor states and how they couple to the lattice vibrations, and
utilize the Ehrenfest mean-field mixed quantum-classical method to describe the
charge transfer dynamics as the nonadiabatic parameter, $\gamma$, is varied. We
find that charge transfer rates increase by several orders of magnitude as the
system is driven to the coherent, adiabatic limit, even at elevated
temperatures, and delineate the inter-dot and torsional acoustic modes that
couple most strongly to the charge transfer reaction coordinate.

${\beta}$-LiGaO$_2$ with an orthorhombic wurtzite-derived structure is a
candidate ultrawide direct-bandgap semiconductor. In this work, using the
non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona approach, we investigate the bandgap
renormalization arising from electron-phonon coupling. We find a sizable
zero-point motion correction of -0.362 eV to the gap at ${\Gamma}$, which is
dominated by the contributions of long-wavelength longitudinal optical phonons.
The bandgap of ${\beta}$-LiGaO$_2$ decreases monotonically with increasing
temperature. We investigate the optical spectra by comparing the model
Bethe-Salpether equation method with the independent-particle approximation.
The calculated optical spectra including electron-hole interactions exhibit
strong excitonic effects, in qualitative agreement with experiment. The
contributing interband transitions and the binding energy for the excitonic
states are analyzed.

<h3>How to grow an oscillator network with enhanced synchronization</h3>

<br>
We study a way to set the natural frequency of a newly added oscillator in a
growing network to enhance synchronization. Population growth is one of the
typical features of many oscillator systems for which synchronization is
required to perform their functions properly. Despite this significance, little
has been known about synchronization in growing systems. We suggest effective
growing schemes to enhance synchronization as the network grows under a
predetermined rule. Specifically, we find that a method based on a link-wise
order parameter outperforms that based on the conventional global order
parameter. With simple solvable examples, we verify that the results coincide
with intuitive expectations. The numerical results demonstrate that the
approximate optimal values from the suggested method show a larger
synchronization enhancement in comparison to other naive strategies. The
results also show that our proposed approach outperforms others over a wide
range of coupling strengths.

<br>
<br>
The photo-induced band structure variation of a rare-earth-based
semiconductor, samarium monosulfide (SmS), was investigated using
high-harmonic-generation laser-based time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.
A nonlinear photo-induced band shift of the Sm 4f multiplets was observed. The
first one is a shift to the high-binding-energy side due to a large surface
photovoltage (SPV) effect of approximately 93 meV, comparable to the size of
the bulk band gap, with a much longer relaxation time than 0.1 ms. The second
one is an ultrafast band shift to the low binding energy side, which is in the
opposite direction to the SPV shift, suggesting an ultrafast valence transition
from divalent to trivalent Sm ions due to photo-excitation. The latter energy
shift was approximately 58 meV, which is consistent with the energy gap shift
from ambient pressure to the boundary between the black insulator and golden
metallic phase with the application of pressure. This suggests that the
photo-induced valence transition can reach the phase boundary, but other
effects are necessary to realize the golden metallic phase.

<h3>Deterministic synthesis of phase pure 2D perovskites via progressive  transformation of layer thickness</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have emerged as semiconductor
platforms for realizing efficient and durable optoelectronic devices. However,
the reproducible synthesis of 2D perovskite crystals with desired layer
thickness (or n value) greater than 2, has been an enduring challenge due to
the lack of kinetic control (temperature, time, stoichiometry) for each layer
thickness. Here, we demonstrate a novel method term as the kinetically
controlled space confinement (KCSC) for the deterministic growth of phase pure
Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) and Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskites. The phase-pure
growth was achieved by progressively increasing the temperature (fixed time) or
the crystallization time (fixed temperature), which allowed for an acute
control of the crystallization kinetics. We also observe a systematic
transformation from a lower n-value to n=3, 4, 5, 6 in 2D perovskites. In-situ
photoluminescence spectroscopy and imaging suggest that the progressive
transformation from lower to higher n-value occurs via intercalation of excess
precursor ions. These experiments enabled the development of a machine learning
assisted multi-parameter phase diagram, which predicts the growth of 2D phase
with a specific n-value.

<h3>Surface Ferron Excitations in Ferroelectrics and Their Directional  Routing</h3>

<br>
<br>
The duality between the electric and magnetic dipoles inspires recent
comparisons between ferronics and magnonics. Here we predict surface
polarization waves or ``ferrons" in ferroelectric insulators, taking the
long-range dipolar interaction into account. We predict properties that are
strikingly different from the magnetic counterpart, \textit{i.e.} the surface
``Damon-Eshbach" magnons in ferromagnets. The dipolar interaction pushes the
ferron branch with locked circular polarization and momentum to the ionic
plasma frequency. The low-frequency modes are on the other hand in-plane
polarized normal to their wave vectors. The strong anisotropy of the lower
branch renders directional emissions of electric polarization and chiral near
fields when activated by a focused laser beam, allowing optical routing in
ferroelectric devices.

<h3>Topological Phases in Coupled Polyyne Chains</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the electronic properties of coupled parallel Polyyne chains in a
couple of symmetric stacking arrangements, namely the AA stacking and the
stacking AB, with the single and triple carbon bonds of one chain aligned (AA)
and anti-aligned (AB) with those of the other chain. Both these arrangements
described by tight binding Hamiltonians, whose parameters are calibrated by
matching low energy dispersion provided by first principle calculations, fall
in the BDI class of topological classification scheme. We calculate the
topological invariants for all the three topological phases of the system: one
for the AA stacking and 2 for the AB one. In the AA stacking, both the
insulating and the metallic phase belongs to the same topological phase.
Whereas, the model exhibits two different values of the topological invariant
in the two different insulating phases (structurally differentiated by
transverse strain). In this later stacking though transition between two
distinct topological phases with the closure of the gap is practically
unachievable due requirement of high amount of transverse strain. We also show
existence of 4 non-zero energy edge modes in the AA stacking and that of 2 zero
energy edge modes in one of the topological phases for the AB stacking.

Spin momentum locking is a key feature of the topological surface state,
which plays an important role in spintronics. The electrical detection of
current-induced spin polarization protected by the spin momentum locking in
non-magnetic systems provides a new platform for developing spintronics while
previous studies were mostly based on magnetic materials. In this study, the
spin transport measurement of Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 was studied by the
three-terminal geometry, and a hysteresis loop signal with high resistance and
low resistance state was observed. The hysteresis was reversed by reversing the
current direction, which illustrates the spin-momentum locking feature of
Cd3As2. Furthermore, we realized the on-off states of the spin signals through
electric modulation of the Fermi arc via the three-terminal configuration,
which enables the great potential of Cd3As2 in spin field-effect transistors.

Black phosphorus (BP) stands out from other 2D materials by the wide
amplitude of the band-gap energy (Delta(Eg)) that sweeps an optical window from
Visible (VIS) to Infrared (IR) wavelengths, depending on the layer thickness.
This singularity made the optical and excitonic properties of BP difficult to
map. Specifically, the literature lacks in presenting experimental and
theoretical data on the optical properties of BP on an extended thickness
range. Here we report the study of an ensemble of photoluminescence spectra
from 79 passivated BP flakes recorded at 4 K with thicknesses ranging from 4 nm
to 700 nm, obtained by mechanical exfoliation. We observe that the exfoliation
steps induce additional defects states that compete the radiative recombination
from bound excitons observed in the crystal. We also show that the evolution of
the photoluminescence energy versus thickness follows a quantum well
confinement model appreciable from a thickness predicted and probed at 25 nm.
The BP slabs placed in different 2D heterostructures show that the emission
energy is not significantly modulated by the dielectric environment.

<br>
<br>
The interplay between charge transfer and electronic disorder in
transition-metal dichalcogenide multilayers gives rise to superconductive
coupling driven by proximity enhancement, tunneling and superconducting
fluctuations, of a yet unwieldy variety. Artificial spacer layers introduced
with atomic precision change the density of states by charge transfer. Here, we
tune the superconductive coupling between NbSe$_2$ monolayers from
proximity-enhanced to tunneling-dominated. We correlate normal and
superconducting properties in [(SnSe)$_{1+{\delta}}$]$_m$[NbSe$_2$]$_1$
tailored multilayers with varying SnSe layer thickness. From high-field
magnetotransport the critical fields yield Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths
with an increase of 140 % cross-plane , trending towards two-dimensional
superconductivity for m > 9. We show cross-over between three regimes: metallic
with proximity-enhanced coupling, disordered-metallic with intermediate
coupling and insulating with Josephson tunneling. Our results demonstrate that
stacking metal mono- and dichalcogenides allows to convert a
metal/superconductor into an insulator/superconductor system, prospecting the
control of two-dimensional superconductivity in embedded layers.

<br>
<br>
We give a topological classification of defect lines in cholesteric liquid
crystals using methods from contact topology. By focusing on the role played by
the chirality of the material, we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between
`tight' and `overtwisted' disclination lines not detected by standard homotopy
theory arguments. The classification of overtwisted lines is the same as
nematics, however, we show that tight disclinations possess a topological layer
number that is conserved as long as the twist is nonvanishing. Finally, we
observe that chirality frustrates the escape of removable defect lines, and
explain how this frustration underlies the formation of several structures
observed in experiments.

<h3>Interplay of dynamic correlations and uniaxial strain driving magnetic  phase transitions in LaMnO$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01090</a>
<br>
<i>Florian P. Lindner, Markus Aichhorn, Hrishit Banerjee</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent years have seen tremendous progress in experimental techniques to
create uniaxial strain. Motivated by these advances we investigate the effect
of uniaxial strain on LaMnO$_3$ employing ab-initio dynamical mean-field
theory. Projecting on the low-energy subspace of Mn $3d$ states, and solving
multi-impurity problems, our approach emphasizes on local correlations at Mn
sites. At ambient pressures, LaMnO$_3$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit
cell, with in-plane lattice constants $a<b$. If we apply uniaxial compressive
strain such that the in-plane lattice becomes square with lattice constant $a$,
we find a ferromagnetic insulating state. This is in contrast to DFT results
using various functionals like PBE, PBE+$U$, and hybrid functionals like HSE,
which all predict a half-metallic ferromagnetic behaviour in this case, due to
the static treatment of correlations. Interestingly, applying uniaxial tensile
strain, such that the in-plane lattice becomes square with the longer lattice
constant $b$, an antiferromagnetic insulating state is observed, similar to the
case of unstrained LMO. We trace back these result to the reduction in
Jahn-Teller distortion in the case of compressive strain, favoring a
ferromagnetic state. This reduction is absent in the tensile case, and the
antiferromagnetic state therefore survives.

<h3>Nonlinear behaviour of the nonradiative exciton reservoir in quantum  wells</h3>

<br>
<br>
Excitons and free charge carriers with large wave vectors form a nonradiative
reservoir, which can strongly affect properties of bright excitons due to the
exciton-exciton and exciton-carrier interactions. In the present work, the
dynamics of quasiparticles in the reservoir at different areal densities is
experimentally studied in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well using a time-resolved
reflectance spectroscopy of nonradiative broadening of exciton resonances. The
population of the reservoir is controlled either by the excitation power or by
the temperature of the structure under study. The dynamics is quantitatively
analyzed in the framework of the model developed earlier [Kurdyubov et al.,
Phys. Rev. B {\bf 104}, 035414 (2021)]. The model considers several dynamic
processes, such as scattering of photoexcited excitons into the reservoir,
dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers and the reverse process,
carrier-induced exciton scattering into the light cone depleting the reservoir,
thermally activated nonradiative losses of charge carriers. We have found that
competition of these processes leads to highly nonlinear dynamics of reservoir
excitons, although their density is far below the exciton Mott transition
densities. Characteristic rates of the processes and their dependencies on the
excitation power and the temperature are determined.

<br>
<br>
The lifetimes of magnetic hopfions on a discrete lattice with competing
exchange interactions are calculated within the framework of the transition
state theory for magnetic degrees of freedom. Three sets of discrete model
parameters corresponding to the same continuous micromagnetic model are
considered. Minimal energy paths for hopfion collapses were found on the
multdimensional energy surface of the system. The activation energies of the
collapse processes have been calculated. It turned out that the activation
energy differs significantly for the three considered values of the parameters,
which indicates the importance of lattice effects on this scale. Along with the
collapse, the hopfion escape process through the sample boundary is studied. It
is shown that this process does not require an activation energy. The lifetimes
of hopfions are found and it is shown that they can exist only at temperatures
of a few kelvins and practically cannot be generated due to thermal
fluctuations.

Collective lattice dynamics determine essential aspects of condensed matter,
such as elastic and thermal properties. These exhibit strong dependence on the
length-scale, reflecting the marked wavevector dependence of lattice
excitations. The extreme ultraviolet transient grating (EUV TG) approach has
demonstrated the potential of accessing a wavevector range corresponding to the
10s of nm length-scale, representing a spatial scale of the highest relevance
for fundamental physics and forefront technology, previously inaccessible by
optical TG and other inelastic scattering methods. In this manuscript we report
on the capabilities of this technique in the context of probing thermoelastic
properties of matter, both in the bulk and at the surface, as well as
discussing future developments and practical considerations.

Coupling of space-separated oscillators is interesting for quantum and
communication technologies. In this work, it is shown that two
antiferromagnetic oscillators placed inside an electromagnetic cavity couple
cooperatively to its terahertz modes and, in effect, hybridized
magnon-polariton modes are formed. This is supported by a systematic study of
reflection spectra from two parallel-plane slabs of hematite
($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), measured as a function of their temperatures and
separation distance, and modeled theoretically. The mediating cavity was formed
by the crystals themselves and the experiment was performed in a practical
distance range of a few millimetres and above room temperature. Cavity-mediated
coupling allows for engineering of complex resonators controlled by their
geometry and by sharing properties of their components.

We report measurements of the Meissner screening profile in a Nb(300
nm)/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin film using $^{8}$Li $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic
resonance ($\beta$-NMR). The NMR probe $^{8}$Li was ion-implanted into the Nb
film at energies $\leq$ 20 keV, corresponding to mean stopping depths
comparable to Nb's magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$. $^{8}$Li's strong
dipole-dipole coupling with the host $^{93}$Nb nuclei provided a
"cross-relaxation" channel that dominated in low magnetic fields, which
conferred indirect sensitivity to the local magnetic field via the spin-lattice
relaxation (SLR) rate $1/T_{1}$. From a fit of the $1/T_{1}$ data to a model
accounting for its dependence on temperature, magnetic field, and
$^{8}$Li$^{+}$ implantation energy, we obtained a magnetic penetration depth
$\lambda_{0}$ = 51.5(22) nm, consistent with a relatively short carrier
mean-free-path $\ell$ = 18.7(29) nm typical of similarly prepared Nb films. The
results presented here constitute an important step towards using $^{8}$Li
$\beta$-NMR to characterize bulk Nb samples with engineered surfaces, which are
often used in the fabrication of particle accelerators.

<br>
<br>
Ruddelsden-Popper halide perovskites are highly versatile
quasi-twodimensional energy materials with a wide range of tunable
optoelectronic properties. Here we use the all-inorganic
Cs$_{n+1}$Pb$_n$X$_{3n+1}$ Ruddelsden-Popper perovskites with X=I, Br, and Cl
to systematically model the effect of octahedral tilting distortions on the
energy landscape, band gaps, macroscopic polarization, and the emergence of
Rashba-/Dresselhaus splitting in these materials. We construct all unique $n=1$
and $n=2$ structures following from octahedral tilts and use first-principles
density functional theory to calculate total energies, polarizations and band
structures, backed up by band gap calculations using the $GW$ approach. Our
results demonstrate that the energies and band structure properties of this
class of materials are governed by a complex interplay of the amplitude,
direction, and character of the distortion modes that contribute to each
octahedral tilt pattern. Our results provide design rules for tailoring
structural distortions, band gaps and the Rashba-/Dresselhaus effect by
inducing octahedral tilts, for example via deliberate choice of organic spacer
molecules or by epitaxial strain.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the motion of groups of intruders in a two-dimensional
granular system by using discrete numerical simulations. By imposing either a
constant velocity or a thrusting force on larger disks (intruders) that move
within smaller ones (grains), we obtained instantaneous positions and
components of forces for each intruder and grain. We found that (i) intruders
cooperate even when at relatively large distances from each other; (ii) the
cooperative dynamics is the result of contact chains linking the intruders as
well as compaction and expansion of the granular medium in front and behind,
respectively, each intruder; (iii) the collaborative behavior depends on the
initial arrangement of intruders; and (iv) for some initial arrangements, the
same spatial configuration is eventually reached. Finally, we show the
existence of an optimal distance for minimum drag for a given set of intruders,
which can prove useful for devices stirring the ground or other granular
surfaces.

<h3>Non-thermal fixed points of universal sine-Gordon coarsening dynamics</h3>

<i>Philipp Heinen, Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Christian-Marcel Schmied, Thomas Gasenzer</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine coarsening of field-excitation patterns of the sine-Gordon (SG)
model, in two and three spatial dimensions, identifying it as universal
dynamics near non-thermal fixed points. The SG model is relevant in many
different contexts, from solitons in quantum fluids to structure formation in
the universe. The coarsening process entails anomalously slow self-similar
transport of the spectral distribution of excitations towards low energies,
induced by the collisional interactions between the field modes. The focus is
set on the non-relativistic limit exhibiting particle excitations only,
governed by a Schr\"odinger-type equation with Bessel-function non-linearity.
The results of our classical statistical simulations suggest that, in contrast
to wave turbulent cascades, in which the transport is local in momentum space,
the coarsening is dominated by rather non-local processes corresponding to a
spatial containment in position space. The scaling analysis of a kinetic
equation obtained with path-integral techniques corroborates this numerical
observation and suggests that the non-locality is directly related to the
slowness of the scaling in space and time. Our methods, which we expect to be
applicable to more general types of models, could open a long-sought path to
analytically describing universality classes behind domain coarsening and
phase-ordering kinetics from first principles, which are usually modelled in a
near-equilibrium setting by a phenomenological diffusion-type equation in
combination with conservation laws.

<h3>Anomalous scaling at non-thermal fixed points of the sine-Gordon model</h3>

<i>Philipp Heinen, Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Thomas Gasenzer</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend the theory of non-thermal fixed points to the case of anomalously
slow universal scaling dynamics according to the sine-Gordon model. This
entails the derivation of a kinetic equation for the momentum occupancy of the
scalar field from a non-perturbative two-particle irreducible effective action,
which re-sums a series of closed loop chains akin to a large-$N$ expansion at
next-to-leading order. The resulting kinetic equation is analyzed for possible
scaling solutions in space and time that are characterized by a set of
universal scaling exponents and encode self-similar transport to low momenta.
Assuming the momentum occupancy distribution to exhibit a scaling form we can
determine the exponents by identifying the dominating contributions to the
scattering integral and power counting. If the field exhibits strong variations
across many wells of the cosine potential, the scattering integral is dominated
by the scattering of many quasiparticles such that the momentum of each single
participating mode is only weakly constrained. Remarkably, in this case, in
contrast to wave turbulent cascades, which correspond to local transport in
momentum space, our results suggest that kinetic scattering here is dominated
by rather non-local processes corresponding to a spatial containment in
position space. The corresponding universal correlation functions in momentum
and position space corroborate this conclusion. Numerical simulations performed
in accompanying work yield scaling properties close to the ones predicted here.

<h3>Critical effects and scaling at meniscus osculation transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01166</a>

We propose a simple scaling theory describing critical effects at rounded
meniscus osculation transitions which occur when the Laplace radius of a
condensed macroscopic drop of liquid coincides with the local radius of
curvature $R_w$ in a confining parabolic geometry. We argue that the exponent
$\beta_{\rm osc}$ characterising the scale of the interfacial height $\ell_0
\propto R_w^{\beta_{\rm osc}}$ at osculation, for large $R_w$, falls into two
regimes representing fluctuation-dominated and mean-field like behaviour,
respectively. These two regimes are separated by an upper critical dimension,
which is determined here explicitly and which depends on the range of the
intermolecular forces. In the fluctuation-dominated regime, representing the
universality class of systems with short-ranged forces, the exponent is related
to the value of the interfacial wandering exponent $\zeta$ by $\beta_{\rm
osc}=3\zeta/(4-\zeta)$. In contrast, in the mean-field regime, which has not
been previously identified, and which occurs for systems with longer ranged
forces (and higher dimensions), the exponent $\beta_{\rm osc}$ takes the same
value as the exponent $\beta_s^{\rm co}$ for complete wetting which is
determined directly by the intermolecular forces. The prediction $\beta_{\rm
osc}=3/7$ in $d=2$ for systems with short-ranged forces (corresponding to
$\zeta=1/2$) is confirmed using an interfacial Hamiltonian model which
determines the exact scaling form for the decay of the interfacial height
probability distribution function. A numerical study in $d=3$, based on a
microscopic model Density Functional Theory, determines that $\beta_{\rm osc}
\approx \beta_s^{\rm co}\approx 0.326$ close to the predicted value $1/3$
appropriate to the mean-field regime for dispersion forces.

<h3>Impact of the electric field on superconductivity in Bose-Einstein  Condensation regime</h3>

In the strong coupling Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) regime the
superconductors have two characteristic temperatures: $T^*$- onset of fermion
pairing and $T_{sc}$- onset of superconductivity, such that $T_{sc}<T^*$. In
the present article, we consider time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory of
superconductors with slab geometry and show that applied electric field, in the
temperature interval $(T_{sc},T^*)$, Bose condenses the Cooper pairs thereby
increasing the superconductor critical temperature $T^E_{sc}>T_{sc}$. Important
consequence is the fact that arbitrary temperature within the interval
($T_{sc},T^*$) is a critical temperature of superconductor transition if an
appropriate electric field is applied. This means that if we set the
temperature of the system within the above mentioned interval and increase the
applied electric field the system undergoes an electric field induced
transition to superconductor.
We also show the existence of critical value of the applied electric field at
which $T^*=T^E_{sc}$. This means that although the system is in BEC regime,
away from the BCS one, we can apply an electric field that moves the system
to a state with $T^E_{sc}=T^*$, characteristic of BCS regime. The results
indicate that applied electric field experiments are a suitable tool to
identify the BEC regime of the superconductors. The experiment can determine
$T^*$ as a temperature below which the electric field Bose condenses the Cooper
pairs, while above it the electrons screen the field and it cannot penetrate.

In this paper, the interplay between spin wave and magnetic vortex is
studied. We find three types of magnon scatterings: skew scattering, symmetric
side deflection and back reflection, which associate with respectively magnetic
topology, energy density distribution and linear momentum transfer torque
within vortex. The vortex core exhibits two translational modes: the intrinsic
circular mode and a coercive elliptical mode, which can be excited based on
permanent and periodic magnon spin-transfer torque effects of spin wave.
Lastly, we propose a vortex-based spin wave valve in which via inhomogeneity
modulation we access arbitrary control of the phase shift.

Alloying a material and hence segregating solutes to grain boundaries is one
way to tailor a material to the demands of its application. Direct observation
of solute segregation is necessary to understand how the interfacial properties
are altered. In this study, we investigate the atomic structure of a high angle
grain boundary both in pure copper and upon silver segregation by
aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and
spectroscopy. We further correlate the experiments to atomistic simulations to
quantify the local solute excess and its impact on grain boundary properties.
We observe that the grain boundary structure remains intact upon silver
segregation and up to five different positions within a structural unit serve
as segregation sites. By combining the atomic resolution observation with
atomistic modelling, we are able to quantify the local silver concentration and
elucidate the underlying segregation mechanism.

<br>
<br>
LaTe$_3$ is a noncentrosymmetric (NC) material with time reversal (TR)
symmetry in which the charge density wave (CDW) is hosted by the Te bilayers.
Here, we show that LaTe$_3$ hosts a Kramers nodal line (KNL), a twofold
degenerate nodal line that connects the TR invariant momenta in NC achiral
systems, using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), density
functional theory (DFT), effective band structure (EBS) calculated by band
unfolding, and symmetry arguments. DFT incorporating spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
reveals that the KNL -- protected by the TR and lattice symmetries -- imposes
gapless crossings between the bilayer-split CDW-induced shadow bands and the
main bands. In excellent agreement with the EBS, ARPES data corroborate the
presence of the KNL and show that the crossings traverse the Fermi level.
Furthermore, spinless nodal lines - entirely gapped out by the SOC - are formed
by the linear crossings of the shadow and main bands with a high Fermi
velocity.

<h3>Interplay of stripe and double-Q magnetism with superconductivity in  $\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x}\mathrm{K}_{x}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ under the  influence of magnetic fields</h3>

At $x\approx0.25$
$\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x}\mathrm{K}_{x}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ undergoes a
novel first-order transition from a four-fold symmetric double-Q magnetic phase
to a two-fold symmetric single-Q phase, which was argued to occur
simultaneously with the onset of superconductivity (B\"ohmer et al., Nat. Comm.
6, 7911 (2015)). Here, by applying magnetic fields up to 10T, we investigate in
more detail the interplay of superconductivity with this magneto-structural
transition using a combination of high-resolution thermal-expansion and
heat-capacity measurements. We find that a magnetic field suppresses the
reentrance of the single-Q orthorhombic phase more strongly than the
superconducting transition, resulting in a splitting of the zero-field
first-order transition. The suppression rate of the orthorhombic reentrance
transition is stronger for out-of-plane than for in-plane fields and scales
with the anisotropy of the superconducting state. These effects are captured
within a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau model, strongly suggesting that the
suppression of the reentrant orthorhombic single-Q phase is primarily linked to
the field-induced weakening of the superconducting order. Not captured by this
model is however a strong reduction of the orthorhombic distortion for
out-of-plane fields, which deserves further theoretical attention.

<h3>Thermoelectric properties of Sb doped AlFe$_2$B$_2$</h3>

In this work, thermoelectric properties of Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$ compound
were investigated over a temperature range from 300\,K to 773\,K.
Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$ compound was produced by vacuum arc melting of Al, Fe,
and B followed by annealing at 1323 K under argon atmosphere. The annealed
ingots were subsequently crushed into powder and hot pressed at 1273 K under
vacuum. The hot-pressed alloy predominantly contained Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$
phase with a small fraction of FeB, which decreases further upon 0.1 \% Sb
doping in Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$. The pristine Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$ exhibits
n-type conductivity with a maximum figure of merit (zT) of 0.03 at 773\,K. The
Sb doping improves the Seebeck coefficient at high temperatures and also
reduces the phonon thermal conductivity across the temperature range studied.
The decrease in phonon thermal conductivity is attributed to the point-defect
phonon scattering due to mass fluctuation between the Fe and Sb atoms. The 0.1
at\% Sb doping at the Fe site results in improved zT of 0.056 at 773\,K in
spite of its limited dissolution in Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$ and forms FeSb$_2$
secondary phase.

Among the different types of switchable molecular compounds, sublimable
Fe(II) SCO molecules provide a suitable platform to develop smart devices that
respond to external stimuli. Here we report the synthesis, crystallographic
structure and magnetic properties of three new neutral Fe(II) SCO molecules
belonging to the {Fe[H2B(pz)2]2(L)} family with bidentate-alpha-diimine ligands
L = 3-(pyridin-2-yl)-[1,2,3]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (tzpy),
5,5,6,6-tetrahydro-4H,4H-2,2-bi(1,3-thiazine) (btz) and
4,4,5,5-tetrahydro-2,2-bithiazole (bt) (1, 2 and 3, respectively), as well as
two solvated forms of 1 and 3. All three desolvated compounds present thermal-
and light-induced SCO transitions with different degrees of cooperativity and
effectiveness. Furthermore, 1 and 2 are demonstrated to be sublimable under HV
conditions affording homogeneous thin films 200 nm thick (TF1 and TF2) that
retain the chemical integrity of the original molecules regardless the
deposition surface. The SCO behaviour of the films is characterized by XAS
technique revealing the partial retainment of both thermal- and light-induced
spin transitions, yet losing the cooperativity. Finally, SCO/2D horizontal
hybrid devices based on CVD-graphene are produced using these films. Being the
first ones of this type utilizing molecules of {Fe[H2B(pz)2]2(L)} family, with
L = tzpy and btz, the devices have allowed the successful detection of the
thermal SCO transition through the electric properties of the CVD-graphene.

Graphene/hBN heterostructures can be considered as one of the basic building
blocks for the next-generation optoelectronics mostly owing to the record-high
electron mobilities. However, currently, the studies of the intrinsic optical
properties of graphene are limited to the standard substrates (SiO2/Si, glass,
quartz) despite the growing interest in graphene/hBN heterostructures. This can
be attributed to a challenging task of the determination of hBN's strongly
anisotropic dielectric tensor in the total optical response. In this study, we
overcome this issue through imaging spectroscopic ellipsometry utilizing
simultaneous analysis of hBN's optical response with and without graphene
monolayers. Our technique allowed us to retrieve the optical constants of
graphene from graphene/hBN heterostructures in a broad spectral range of
250-950 nm. Our results suggest that graphene's absorption on hBN may exceed
the one of graphene on SiO2/Si by about 60 %.

<h3>Thermal first-order phase transitions, Ising critical points, and  reentrance in the Ising-Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square  lattice in a magnetic field</h3>

The thermal phase transitions of a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on the
diamond-decorated square lattice in a magnetic field are investigated using a
decoration-iteration transformation and classical Monte Carlo simulations. A
generalized decoration-iteration transformation maps this model exactly onto an
effective classical Ising model on the square lattice with
temperature-dependent effective nearest-neighbor interactions and magnetic
field strength. The effective field vanishes along a ground-state phase
boundary of the original model, separating a ferrimagnetic and a quantum
monomer-dimer phase. At finite temperatures this phase boundary gives rise to
an exactly solvable surface of discontinuous (first-order) phase transitions,
which terminates in a line of Ising critical points. The existence of
discontinuous reentrant phase transitions within a narrow parameter regime is
reported and explained in terms of the low-energy excitations from both phases.
These exact results, obtained from the mapping to the zero-field effective
Ising model are corroborated by classical Monte Carlo simulations of the
effective model.

<h3>Second-order topology and supersymmetry in two-dimensional topological  insulators</h3>

We unravel a fundamental connection between a supersymmetry and a wide class
of two dimensional second-order topological insulators (SOTI). This particular
supersymmetry is induced by applying a half-integer Aharonov-Bohm flux
$f=\Phi/\Phi_0=1/2$ through a hole in the system. Here, three symmetries are
essential to establish this fundamental link: chiral symmetry, inversion
symmetry, and mirror symmetry. At such a flux of half-integer value the mirror
symmetry anticommutes with the inversion symmetry leading to a nontrivial
$n=1$-SUSY representation for the absolute value of the Hamiltonian in each
chiral sector, separately. This implies that a unique zero-energy state and an
exact $2$-fold degeneracy of all eigenstates with non-zero energy is found even
at finite system size. For arbitrary smooth surfaces the link between 2D-SOTI
and SUSY can be described within a universal low-energy theory in terms of an
effective surface Hamiltonian which encompasses the whole class of
supersymmetric periodic Witten models. Applying this general link to the
prototypical example of a Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang-model with an in-plane Zeeman
field, we analyse the entire phase diagram and identify a gapless Weyl phase
separating the topological from the non-topological gapped phase. Surprisingly,
we find that topological states localized at the outer surface remain in the
Weyl phase, whereas topological hole states move to the outer surface and
change their spatial symmetry upon approaching the Weyl phase. Therefore, the
topological hole states can be tuned in a versatile manner opening up a route
towards magnetic-field-induced topological engineering in multi-hole systems.
Finally, we demonstrate the stability of localized states against deviation
from half-integer flux, flux penetration into the sample, surface distortions,
and random impurities for impurity strengths up to the order of the surface
gap.

Fracton phases are a particularly exotic type of quantum spin liquids where
the elementary quasiparticles are intrinsically immobile. These phases may be
described by unconventional gauge theories known as tensor or multipolar gauge
theories, characteristic for so-called type-I or type-II fracton phases,
respectively. Both variants have been associated with distinctive singular
patterns in the spin structure factor, such as multifold pinch points for
type-I and quadratic pinch points for type-II fracton phases. Here, we assess
the impact of quantum fluctuations on these patterns by numerically
investigating the spin $S=1/2$ quantum version of a classical spin model on the
octahedral lattice featuring exact realizations of multifold and quadratic
pinch points, as well as an unusual pinch line singularity. Based on large
scale pseudo fermion and pseudo Majorana functional renormalization group
calculations, we take the intactness of these spectroscopic signatures as a
measure for the stability of the corresponding fracton phases. We find that in
all three cases, quantum fluctuations significantly modify the shape of pinch
points or lines by smearing them out and shifting signal away from the
singularities in contrast to effects of pure thermal fluctuations. This
indicates possible fragility of these phases and allows us to identify
characteristic fingerprints of their remnants.

Magnetic hopfions are string-like three-dimensional topological solitons,
characterised by the Hopf invariant. They serve as a fundamental prototype for
three-dimensional magnetic quasi-particles and are an inspiration for novel
device concepts in the field of spintronics. Based on a micromagnetic model and
without considering temperature, the existence of such hopfions has been
predicted in certain magnets with competing exchange interactions. However,
physical realisation of freely moving hopfions in bulk magnets have so far been
elusive. Here, we consider an effective Heisenberg model with competing
exchange interactions and study the stability of small toroidal hopfions with
Hopf number $Q_\text{H}=1$ by finding first-order saddle points on the energy
surface representing the transition state for the decay of hopfions via the
formation of two coupled Bloch points. We combine the geodesic nudged elastic
band method and an adapted implementation of the dimer method to resolve the
sharp energy profile of the reaction path near the saddle point. Our analysis
reveals that the energy barrier can reach substantial height and is largely
determined by the size of the hopfion relative to the lattice constant.

We report on resonance Raman spectroscopy measurements with excitation photon
energy down to 1.16 eV on graphene. Thanks to an excitation energy close to the
Dirac point at K, we unveil a giant increase of the intensity ratio between the
double-resonant 2D and 2D' peaks with respect to that measured in graphite. We
directly measure the bending of the 2D peak dispersion that in graphene is
connected to the presence of the Kohn anomaly. Comparing our experimental
findings with fully ab initio theoretical calculations, we conclude that both
observations are explained by a strong enhancement of the coupling between
electrons and Brillouin zone-boundary optical phonons. This result implies that
in graphene the scattering with optical zone boundary phonons is stronger than
what previously thought, and this could have crucial consequences for the
modeling of transport in graphene devices operating at room temperature

We study the phenomenon of cosmological particle production of Dirac fermions
in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on a (1+1)-dimensional case
in which the evolution of the scale factor is set by the equations of
Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. As a first step towards a quantum simulation of this
phenomenon, we consider two possible lattice regularizations, which allow us to
explore the interplay of particle production and topological phenomena in
spacetimes with a boundary. In particular, for a Wilson-type discretization of
the Dirac field, the asymptotic Minkowski vacua connected by the intermediate
expansion corresponds to symmetry-protected topological groundstates, and have
a boundary manifestation in the form of zero-modes exponentially localized to
the spatial boundaries. We show that particle production can also populate
these zero modes, which contrasts with the situation with a na\"ive-fermion
discretization, in which conformal zero-mass fields exhibit no particle
production. We present a scheme for the quantum simulation of this
gravitational analogue by means of ultra-cold atoms in Raman optical lattices,
which requires real-time control of the Raman-beam detuning according to the
scale factor of the simulated spacetime, as well as band-mapping measurements.

Understanding the nature of strongly correlated states in flat-band materials
(such as moir\'e heterostructures) is at the forefront of both experimental and
theoretical pursuits. While magnetotransport, scanning probe, and optical
techniques are often very successful in investigating the properties of the
underlying order, the exact nature of the ground state often remains unknown.
Here we propose to leverage strong light-matter coupling present in the
flat-band systems to gain insight through dynamical dielectric response into
the structure of the many-body ground state. We argue that due to the
enlargement of the effective lattice of the system arising from correlations,
conventional long-range plasmon becomes ``folded'' to yield a multiband plasmon
spectrum. We detail several mechanisms through which the structure of the
plasmon spectrum and that of the dynamical dielectric response is susceptible
to the underlying order revealing valued insights such as the
interaction-driven band gaps, spin-structure, and the order periodicity.

One dimensional conductors are described by Luttinger liquid theory, which
predicts a power-law suppression of the density of states near the Fermi level.
The scaling exponent is non-universal in the general case, but is predicted to
be quantized for the chiral edge states of the fractional quantum Hall effect.
Here, we report conductance measurements across a point contact linking integer
and fractional quantum Hall edge states. At weak coupling, we observe the
predicted universal quadratic scaling with temperature and voltage. At strong
coupling, the conductance saturates to e^2/2h, arising from perfect Andreev
reflection of fractionalized quasi-particles at the point contact. We use the
strong coupling physics to realize a nearly dissipationless DC voltage step-up
transformer, whose gain of 3/2 arises directly from topological
fractionalization of electrical charge.
