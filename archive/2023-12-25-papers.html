<h3>Enhanced Capacitance in Surfactant Mediated Ion Complexes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14170</a>
<br>
<i>Jihua Chen, Jan Michael Y. Carrillo, Rigoberto Advincula</i>
<p>Ion complexes hold the key for various energy transfer and communication
systems in nature and industries. Controllable mechanical and electrical
properties are highly desirable but remain challenging to achieve in these
complex systems. In this work, we proposed to use amphiphilic molecules to
mediate salt crystallization, and the resultant ionic interfaces can be tunable
through the reduced surface tensions of crystal facets, an additional
intermolecular modifier, as well as the diffusion-limited crystallization
during controlled solvent evaporation. More specifically, an ionic surfactant
Sodium Lauryl sulfoacetate (SLSA) was used here to mediate the crystallization
of sodium chloride. Citric acid (CA) was adopted as a hydrogen-bond modifier.
The highest capacitance was observed in systems mediated by SLSA, while a large
enhancement of capacitance was also observed in systems with both SLSA and CA.
The largely increased capacitance of these ionic complexes was attributed to
changes in interfacial and crystalline grain structures. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), optical microscopy (OM), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
were used to study the effects of surfactant molecules in these ionic
complexes. Understanding the role of ionic complexation in defining the
thermodynamic and kinetic process of the crystallization process will lead to
better optimization in nucleation and scalability of organic and inorganic
crystal production.

<h3>Negative differential resistance in Josephson junctions coupled to a  cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14174" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14174</a>
<br>
<i>N.F. Pedersen, G. Filatrella, V. Pierro, M.P. Sorensen</i>
<p>Regions with negative differential resistance can arise in the IV curve of
Josephson junctions and this phenomenon plays an essential role for
applications, in particular for THz radiation emission. For the measurement of
high frequency radiation from Josephson junctions, a cavity - either internal
or external - is often used. A cavity may also induce a negative differential
resistance region at the lower side of the resonance frequency. We investigate
the dynamics of Josephson junctions with a negative differential resistance in
the quasi particle tunnel current, i.e. in the McCumber curve. We find that
very complicated and unexpected interactions take place. This may be useful for
the interpretation of experimental measurements of THz radiation from intrinsic
Josephson junctions.

<h3>Drude weight in presence of nonlocal potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14178</a>
<br>
<i>Raffaele Resta</i>
<p>The nonlocal potential contributes an extra term to the velocity operator; I
show here that such term affects the formal expression of the Drude weight in a
nontrivial way. Notably, the present main result fixes a disturbing discrepancy
in the Dreyer-Coh-Stengel sum rule [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 095901 (2022)].

<h3>Reversal of Orbital Hall Conductivity and Emergence of Tunable  Topological Quantum States in Orbital Hall Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14181" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14181</a>
<br>
<i>Shilei Ji, Chuye Quan, Ruijia Yao, Jianping Yang, Xing'ao Li</i>
<p>Recent findings indicate that orbital angular momentum (OAM) has the
capability to induce the intrinsic orbital Hall effect (OHE), which is
characterized by orbital Chern number in the orbital Hall insulator. Unlike the
spin-polarized channel in Quantum anomalous Hall insulator, the OAM is
valley-locked, posing challenges in manipulating the corresponding edge state.
Here we demonstrate the sign-reversal orbital Chern number through strain
engineering by combing the $k \cdot p$ model and first-principles calculation.
Under the manipulation of strain, we observe the transfer of non-zero OAM from
the valence band to the conduction band, aligning with the orbital contribution
in the electronic structure. Our investigation reveals that electrons and holes
with OAM exhibit opposing trajectories, resulting in a reversal of the orbital
Hall conductivity. Furthermore, we explore the topological quantum state
between the sign-reversible OHE.

<h3>Stochastic path power and the Laplace transform</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14225" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14225</a>
<br>
<i>S P Fitzgerald, T J W Honour</i>
<p>Transition probabilities for stochastic systems can be expressed in terms of
a functional integral over paths taken by the system. Evaluating the integral
by the saddle point method in the weak-noise limit leads to a remarkable
mapping between dominant stochastic paths and conservative, Hamiltonian
mechanics in an effective potential. The conserved ``energy'' in the effective
system has dimensions of power. We show that this power, H, can be identified
with the Laplace parameter of the time-transformed dynamics. This
identification leads to insights into the non-equilibrium behaviour of the
system. Moreover, it facilitates the explicit summation over families of
trajectories, which is far harder in the time domain. This is crucial for
making contact with the long-time equilibrium limit.

<h3>Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14234</a>
<br>
<i>Takato Yoshimura, Samuel J. Garratt, J. T. Chalker</i>
<p>We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic
features of systems which are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved
densities, as exemplified by spin chains with Floquet time evolution. To
characterise dynamics we examine, in solvable models and numerically, the
behaviour of operator autocorrelation functions, as a function of time and the
size of the operator support. The standard expectation is that operator
autocorrelation functions in such systems are maximum at time zero and decay,
over a few Floquet periods, to a fluctuating value that reduces to zero under
an average over an ensemble of statistically similar systems. Our central
result is that ensemble-averaged correlation functions also display a second
generic feature, which consists of a peak at a later time. In individual
many-body systems, this peak can also be revealed by averaging autocorrelation
functions over complete sets of operators supported within a finite spatial
region, thereby generating a partial spectral form factor. The duration of the
peak grows indefinitely with the size of the operator support, and its
amplitude shrinks, but both are essentially independent of system size provided
this is sufficiently large to contain the operator. In finite systems, the
averaged correlation functions also show a further feature at still later
times, which is a counterpart to the so-called ramp and plateau of the spectral
form factor; its amplitude in the autocorrelation function decreases to zero
with increasing system size. Both the later-time peak and the ramp-and-plateau
feature are specific to models with time-translation symmetry, such as Floquet
systems or models with a time-independent Hamiltonian, and are absent in models
with an evolution operator that is a random function of time, such as the
extensively-studied random unitary circuits.

<h3>Edge-sharing quasi-one-dimensional cuprate fragments in optimally  substituted Cu/Pb apatite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14236</a>
<br>
<i>Katherine Inzani, John Vinson, Sinéad M. Griffin</i>
<p>The flurry of theoretical and experimental studies following the report of
room-temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in Cu-substituted lead
apatite Cu$_x$Pb$_{10-x}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O (`LK99') have explored whether and how
this system might host strongly correlated physics including superconductivity.
While first-principles calculations at low doping ($x\approx1$) have indicated
a Cu-$d^{9}$ configuration coordinated with oxygen giving rise to isolated,
correlated bands, its other structural, electronic, and magnetic properties
diverge significantly from those of other known cuprate systems. Here we find
that higher densities of ordered Cu substitutions can result in the formation
of contiguous edge-sharing Cu-O chains, akin to those found in some members of
the cuprate superconductor family. Interestingly, while such
quasi-one-dimensional edge-sharing chains are typically ferromagnetically
coupled along the chain, we find an antiferromagnetic ground-state magnetic
order for our cuprate fragments which is in proximity to a ferromagnetic
quantum critical point. This is a result of the elongated Cu-Cu distance in
Cu-substituted apatite that leads to larger Cu-O-Cu angles supporting
antiferromagnetism, which we demonstrate to be controllable by strain. Finally,
our electronic structure calculations confirm the low-dimensional nature of the
system and show that the bandwidth is driven by the Cu-O plaquette
connectivity, resulting in an intermediate correlated regime.

<h3>Absence of quantization in the circular photogalvanic effect in  disordered chiral Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14244" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14244</a>
<br>
<i>Ang-Kun Wu, Daniele Guerci, Yixing Fu, Justin H. Wilson, J. H. Pixley</i>
<p>The circularly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is studied in chiral
Weyl semimetals with short-ranged quenched disorder. Without disorder, the
topological properties of chiral Weyl semimetals lead to the quantization of
the CPGE, which is a second-order optical response. Using a combination of
diagrammatic perturbation theory in the continuum and exact numerical
calculations via the kernel polynomial method on a lattice model we show that
disorder perturbatively destabilizes the quantization of the CPGE.

<h3>Pressure-dependent "Insulator-Metal-Insulator" Behavior in Sr-doped  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14251</a>
<br>
<i>Mingyu Xu, Shuyuan Huyan, Haozhe Wang, S. L. Bud'ko, Xinglong Chen, Xianglin Ke, J. F. Mitchell, P. C. Canfield, Jie Li, Weiwei Xie</i>
<p>Recently, superconductivity at high temperatures has been observed in bulk
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-{\delta}}$ under high pressure. However, the attainment of
high-purity La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-{\delta}}$ single crystals, exhibiting controlled
and homogeneous stoichiometry through the post-annealing process in an
oxygen-rich floating zone furnace, remains a formidable challenge. Here, we
report the crystal structure and physical properties of single crystals of
Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ synthesized at high pressure (20 GPa) and high
temperature (1400 {\deg}C). Through single crystal X-ray diffraction, we showed
that high-pressure-synthesized paramagnetic Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with Ni-O-Ni bond angles of
173.4(2){\deg}out-of-plane and 175.0(2){\deg}and 176.7(2){\deg}in plane. The
substitution of Sr alters in band filling and the ratio of Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$
in Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, aligning them with those of
"La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7.05}$", thereby leading to significant modifications in
properties under high pressure relative to the unsubstituted parent phase. At
ambient pressure, Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits insulating properties,
and the conductivity increases as pressure goes up to 10 GPa. However, upon
further increasing pressure beyond 10.7 GPa, Sr-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
transits back from a metal-like behavior to an insulator. The
insulator-metal-insulator trend under high pressure dramatically differs from
the behavior of the parent compound La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-{\delta}}$, despite their
similar behavior in the low-pressure regime. These experimental results
underscore the considerable challenge in achieving superconductivity in
nickelates.

<h3>Statistics of a granular cluster ensemble at a liquid-solid-like phase  transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14268</a>
<br>
<i>Enrique Navarro, Claudio Falcón</i>
<p>We report on the construction of a granular network of particles to study the
formation, evolution and statistical properties of clusters of particles
developing at the vicinity of a liquid-solid-like phase transition within a
vertically vibrated quasi two-dimensional granular system. Using the data of
particle positions and local order from Castillo et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,
095701 (2012)], we extract granular clusters taken as communities of the
granular network via modularity optimization. Each one of these communities is
a patch of particles with a very well defined local orientational order
embedded within an array of other patches forming a complex cluster network.
The distribution of cluster sizes and life-spans for the cluster network depend
on the distance to the liquid-solid-like phase transition of the quasi
two-dimensional granular system. Specifically, the cluster size distribution
displays a scale-invariant behavior for at least a decade in cluster sizes,
while cluster lifespans grows monotonically with each cluster size. We believe
this systematic community analysis for clustering in granular systems can serve
to study and understand the spatio-temporal evolution of mesoscale structures
in systems displaying out-of-equilibrium phase transitions.

<i>Gergő Roósz, Anna Kauch, Frederic Bippus, Daniel Wieser, Karsten Held</i>
<p>Strongly correlated electron systems are challenging to calculate, and
entanglement in such systems is not widely analyzed. We present an approach
that can be used as a post-processing step for calculating the two-site reduced
density matrix and from it entanglement measures such as the mutual information
and entanglement negativity. Input is only the one- and two-particle Green's
function which is the output of numerous many-body methods. As an illustration,
we present results for a toy model, the Hubbard model on a $2\times2$ cluster.

<h3>High-dimensional order parameters and neural network classifiers applied  to amorphous ices</h3>

<br>
<i>Zoé Faure Beaulieu, Volker L. Deringer, Fausto Martelli</i>
<p>Amorphous ice phases are key constituents of water's complex structural
landscape. This study investigates the polyamorphic nature of water, focusing
on the complexities within low-density amorphous ice (LDA), high-density
amorphous ice (HDA), and the recently discovered medium-density amorphous ice
(MDA). We use rotationally-invariant, high-dimensional order parameters to
capture a wide spectrum of local symmetries for the characterisation of local
oxygen environments. We train a neural network (NN) to classify these local
environments, and investigate the distinctiveness of MDA within the structural
landscape of amorphous ice. Our results highlight the difficulty in accurately
differentiating MDA from LDA due to structural similarities. Beyond water, our
methodology can be applied to investigate the structural properties and phases
of disordered materials.

<p>Soft amorphous materials are viscoelastic solids ubiquitously found around
us, from clays and cementitious pastes to emulsions and physical gels
encountered in food or biomedical engineering. Under an external deformation,
these materials undergo a noteworthy transition from a solid to a liquid state
that reshapes the material microstructure. This yielding transition was the
main theme of a workshop held from January 9 to 13, 2023 at the Lorentz Center
in Leiden. The manuscript presented here offers a critical perspective on the
subject, synthesizing insights from the various brainstorming sessions and
informal discussions that unfolded during this week of vibrant exchange of
ideas. The result of these exchanges takes the form of a series of open
questions that represent outstanding experimental, numerical, and theoretical
challenges to be tackled in the near future.

<h3>Polar order, shear banding, and clustering in confined active matter</h3>

<i>Daniel Canavello, Rubens H. Damascena, Leonardo R. E. Cabral, Clécio C. de Souza Silva</i>
<p>We investigate the collective behavior of sterically interacting
self-propelled particles confined in a harmonic potential. Our theoretical and
numerical study unveils the emergence of distinctive collective polar
organizations, revealing how different levels of interparticle torques and
noise influence the system. The observed phases include the shear-banded
vortex, where the system self organizes in two concentric bands rotating in
opposite directions around the potential center; the uniform vortex, where the
two bands merge into a close packed configurations rotating uniformly as a
quasi-rigid body; and the orbiting polar state, characterized by parallel
orientation vectors and the cluster revolving around the potential center,
without rotation, as a rigid body. Intriguingly, at lower filling fractions,
the vortex and polar phases merge into a single phase where the trapped cluster
breaks into smaller polarized clusters, each one orbiting the potential center
as a rigid body.

<h3>40 Years of SCES at Los Alamos</h3>

<i>Z. Fisk, J. L. Smith, J. D. Thompson</i>
<p>Reports of unconventional superconductivity in UBe13 in 1983 and soon
thereafter of the possible coexistence of bulk superconductivity and spin
fluctuations in UPt3 marked the beginning of a 40-year adventure in the study
of strongly correlated quantum materials and phenomena at Los Alamos. The
subsequent discovery and exploration of heavy-fermion magnetism, cuprates,
Kondo insulators, Ce- and Pu-115 superconductors and, more broadly, quantum
states of narrow-band systems provided challenges for the next 30 years.
Progress was not made in a vacuum but benefitted from significant advances in
the Americas, Asia and Europe as well as from essential collaborations,
visitors and Los Alamos students and postdocs, many subsequently setting their
own course in SCES. As often the case, serendipity played a role in shaping
this history.

<h3>Crystal Growth Characterization of WSe$_2$ Thin Film Using Machine  Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14311</a>
<br>
<i>Isaiah A. Moses, Chengyin Wu, Wesley F. Reinhart</i>
<p>Materials characterization remains a labor-intensive process, with a large
amount of expert time required to post-process and analyze micrographs. As a
result, machine learning has become an essential tool in materials science,
including for materials characterization. In this study, we perform an in-depth
analysis of the prediction of crystal coverage in WSe$_2$ thin film atomic
force microscopy (AFM) height maps with supervised regression and segmentation
models. Regression models were trained from scratch and through transfer
learning from a ResNet pretrained on ImageNet and MicroNet to predict monolayer
crystal coverage. Models trained from scratch outperformed those using features
extracted from pretrained models, but fine-tuning yielded the best performance,
with an impressive 0.99 $R^2$ value on a diverse set of held-out test
micrographs. Notably, features extracted from MicroNet showed significantly
better performance than those from ImageNet, but fine-tuning on ImageNet
demonstrated the reverse. As the problem is natively a segmentation task, the
segmentation models excelled in determining crystal coverage on image patches.
However, when applied to full images rather than patches, the performance of
segmentation models degraded considerably, while the regressors did not,
suggesting that regression models may be more robust to scale and dimension
changes compared to segmentation models. Our results demonstrate the efficacy
of computer vision models for automating sample characterization in 2D
materials while providing important practical considerations for their use in
the development of chalcogenide thin films.

<p>Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system to realize
scalable, coupled qubit systems and serve as a fundamental building block for
quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from
imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization,
tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum
dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic
control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable
autonomous tuning approaches are developed. In this report, we outline current
challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a
particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also
present ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them.

<h3>Frustrated metastable-to-equilibrium grain boundary structural  transition in NbMoTaW due to segregation and chemical complexity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14344" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14344</a>
<br>
<i>Ian Geiger, Diran Apelian, Xiaoqing Pan, Penghui Cao, Jian Luo, Timothy J. Rupert</i>
<p>Grain boundary structural transitions can lead to significant changes in the
properties and performance of materials. In multi-principal element alloys,
understanding these transitions becomes complex due to phenomena such as local
chemical ordering and multi-component segregation. Using atomistic simulations,
we explore a metastable-to-equilibrium grain boundary structural transition in
NbMoTaW. The transition, characterized by structural disordering and reduced
free volume, shows high sensitivity to its local chemical environment. Most
notably, the transition temperature range of the alloy is more than twice that
of a pure metal. Differences in composition between coexisting metastable and
equilibrium structures highlight the change in local site availability due to
structural relaxation. Further examination of grain boundaries with fixed
chemical states at varying temperatures reveals that the amount of segregation
significantly influences the onset temperature yet has minimal effect on the
transition width. These insights underscore the profound effects of chemical
complexity and ordering on grain boundary transitions in complex concentrated
alloys, marking a meaningful advancement in our understanding of grain boundary
behavior at the atomic level.

<p>We demonstrate the emergence of collective spin modes with hyperbolic
dispersion in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled polar metals magnetized by
intrinsic ordering or applied fields. These particle-hole bound states exist
for arbitrarily weak repulsive interactions; they are optically accessible and
can be used to generate pure spin current when magnetization is tilted away
from the polar axis. We suggest material hosts for these excitations and
discuss their potential relevance to nanoscale spintronic and polaritonic
applications.

<p>We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of
cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined
cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for
the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin
back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in
undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover
between regions differing in the momentum-dependence of the coupling and not
necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario
extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and
motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the
superconducting phase.

<h3>Broken inversion symmetry in van der Waals topological ferromagnetic  metal iron germanium telluride</h3>

<br>
<i>Kai-Xuan Zhang, Hwiin Ju, Hyuncheol Kim, Jingyuan Cui, Jihoon Keum, Je-Geun Park, Jong Seok Lee</i>
<p>Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and
fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation
spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has
been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium
telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for
interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence
of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by
the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal
symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1
space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane
polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern
to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the
transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is
robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and
below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new
information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium
telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar
metal states.

<p>We report the topological electronic structure, magnetic, and
magnetotransport properties of a noncentrosymmetric compound GdAlSi. Magnetic
susceptibility shows an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_\mathrm{N}$ = 32 K.
In-plane isothermal magnetization exhibits an unusual hysteresis behavior at
higher magnetic field, rather than near zero field. Moreover, the hysteresis
behavior is asymmetric under positive and negative magnetic fields.
First-principles calculations were performed on various magnetic
configurations, revealing that the antiferromagnetic state is the ground state,
and the spiral antiferromagnetic state is a close competing state. The
calculations also reveal that GdAlSi hosts multiple Weyl points near the Fermi
energy. The band structure measured by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) shows relatively good agreement with the theory, with the
possibility of Weyl nodes slightly above the Fermi energy. Within the magnetic
ordered state, we observe an exceptionally large anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) of ~ 1310 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 2 K. Interestingly, the anomalous
Hall effect persists up to room temperature with a significant value of AHC (~
155 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$). Our analysis indicates that the large AHC
originates from the Berry curvature associated with the multiple pairs of Weyl
points near Fermi energy.

<h3>Thermodynamic and Stoichiometric Laws Ruling the Fates of Growing  Systems</h3>

<i>Atsushi Kamimura, Yuki Sughiyama, Tetsuya J. Kobayashi</i>
<p>We delve into growing open chemical reaction systems (CRSs) characterized by
autocatalytic reactions within a variable volume, which changes in response to
these reactions. Understanding the thermodynamics of such systems is crucial
for comprehending biological cells and constructing protocells, as it sheds
light on the physical conditions necessary for their self-replication. Building
on our recent work, where we developed a thermodynamic theory for growing CRSs
featuring basic autocatalytic motifs with regular stoichiometric matrices, we
now expand this theory to include scenarios where the stoichiometric matrix has
a nontrivial left kernel space. This extension introduces conservation laws,
which limit the variations in chemical species due to reactions, thereby
confining the system's possible states to those compatible with its initial
conditions. By considering both thermodynamic and stoichiometric constraints,
we clarify the environmental and initial conditions that dictate the CRSs'
fate-whether they grow, shrink, or reach equilibrium. We also find that the
conserved quantities significantly influence the equilibrium state achieved by
a growing CRS. These results are derived independently of specific
thermodynamic potentials or reaction kinetics, therefore underscoring the
fundamental impact of conservation laws on the growth of the system.

<h3>Evidence for an Excitonic Insulator State in Ta2Pd3Te5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14455" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14455</a>

<p>The excitonic insulator (EI) is an exotic ground state of narrow-gap
semiconductors and semimetals, arising from spontaneous condensation of
electron-hole pairs bound by attractive Coulomb interaction. Despite research
on EIs dating back to half a century ago, their existence in real materials
remains a subject of ongoing debate. In this study, through systematic
experimental and theoretical investigations, we have unveiled the existence of
an EI ground state in the van der Waals compound Ta2Pd3Te5. Density functional
theory calculations suggest that it is a semimetal with a small band overlap,
whereas various experiments exhibit an insulating ground state with a clear
band gap. Upon incorporating electron-hole Coulomb interaction into our
calculations, we obtain an EI phase where the electronic symmetry breaking
opens a many-body gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements
demonstrate that the band gap is closed with a significant change in the
dispersions when charge carriers sufficiently screen the electron-hole Coulomb
interaction. Structural measurements reveal a slight breaking of crystal
symmetry with exceptionally small lattice distortion in the insulating state,
resulting from the coupling to the symmetry-breaking electronic state. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that the insulating ground state with a
gap opening in Ta2Pd3Te5 originates from exciton condensation driven by
electron-hole coupling.

<h3>Spontaneous gap opening and potential excitonic states in an ideal Dirac  semimetal Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</h3>

<p>The opening of an energy gap in the electronic structure generally indicates
the presence of interactions. In materials with low carrier density and short
screening length, long-range Coulomb interaction favors the spontaneous
formation of electron-hole pairs, so-called excitons, opening an excitonic gap
at the Fermi level. Excitonic materials host unique phenomenons associated with
pair excitations. However, there is still no generally recognized
single-crystal material with excitonic order, which is, therefore, awaited in
condensed matter physics. Here, we show that excitonic states may exist in the
quasi-one-dimensional material Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$, which has an almost ideal
Dirac-like band structure, with Dirac point located exactly at Fermi level. We
find that an energy gap appears at 350 K, and it grows with decreasing
temperature. The spontaneous gap opening is absent in a similar material
Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$. Intriguingly, the gap is destroyed by the potassium
deposition on the crystal, likely due to extra-doped carriers. Furthermore, we
observe a pair of in-gap flat bands, which is an analog of the impurity states
in a superconducting gap. All these observations can be properly explained by
an excitonic order, providing Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a new and promising
candidate realizing excitonic states.

<h3>Entropy change due to stochastic state transitions of odd Langevin  system</h3>

<br>
<i>Kento Yasuda</i>
<p>Active microscopic objects, e.g., an enzyme molecule, are modeled by the odd
Langevin system, in which energy injection from the substrate to the enzyme is
described by the antisymmetric part of the elastic matrix. By applying the
Onsager-Machlup integral and large deviation theory to the odd Langevin system,
we can calculate the cumulant generating function of the entropy change of a
thermal bath due to the state transition. For an $N$-component system, we
obtain a formal expression of the cumulant generating function and demonstrate
that the oddness $\lambda$, which quantifies the antisymmetric part of the
elastic matrix, leads to higher-order cumulants that do not appear in a passive
elastic system. To demonstrate the effect of the oddness under the concrete
parameter, we analyze the simplest two-component system and obtain the optimal
transition path and cumulant generating function. The cumulants obtained from
expansion of the cumulant generating function increase monotonically with the
oddness. This implies that the oddness causes the uncertainty of stochastic
state transitions.

<h3>High Magnetoresistance Ratio on hBN Boron-Vacancy/Graphene Magnetic  Tunnel Junction</h3>

<i>Halimah Harfah, Yusuf Wicaksono, Gagus Ketut Sunnardianto, Muhammad Aziz Majidi, Koichi Kusakabe</i>
<p>We presents a new strategy to create a van der Waals-based magnetic tunnel
junction (MTJ) that consists of a three-atom layer thickness of graphene (Gr)
sandwiched with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) by introducing a monoatomic Boron
vacancy in both hBN layers. The magnetic properties and electronic structure of
the system were investigated using density functional theory (DFT), while the
transmission probability of the MTJ was investigated using the
Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism within the non-equilibrium Green function method.
The Stoner gap was found to be created between the spin-majority channel and
the spin-minority channel on LDOS of the hBN monoatomic boron-vacancy (V$_B$)
near the vicinity of Fermi energy, creating a possible control of the spin
valve by considering two different magnetic allignment of hBN(V$_B$) layers,
anti-parallel and parallel configuration. The results of the transmission
probability calculation showed a high electron transmission in the parallel
configuration of the hBN(V$_B$) layers and a low transmission when the
antiparallel configuration was considered. A high TMR ratio of approximately
400% was observed when comparing the antiparallel and parallel configuration of
hBN(V$_B$) layers in the hBN (V$_B$)/Gr/hBN(V$_B$), giving the highest TMR for
the thinnest MTJ system.

<h3>Self-Supervised Generative Models for Crystal Structures</h3>

<br>
<i>Fangze Liu, Zhaotao Chen, Tianyi Liu, Yu Lin, Joshua J. Turner, Chunjing Jia</i>
<p>One fundamental question in condensed matter and materials physics is focused
on how to understand the connection between atomic structures and the
properties of materials. Machine learning techniques have proven powerful in
predicting the latter, given the former. However, predicting atomic structures
is considerably more difficult, especially given several key challenges, such
as the enormous structure design space that exists for materials discovery or
the lack of suitable evaluation metrics for generated materials. In this work,
we combine self-supervised pre-training with a generative adversarial network
(GAN) approach to overcome these difficulties and design an advanced generative
model for predicting crystal structures. Moreover, the framework provides a
unified platform for property predictions as well. We demonstrate the strength
of this method through reconstructing incomplete structures through utilization
of unlabeled data and predict various properties of given materials. The
presented model architecture and methodology can be used to obtain large
crystal graph networks and can be readily adapted for various predictive and
generative tasks. These results offer unprecedented flexibility and pave the
way to more powerful and broader applications of machine learning to material
characterization, discoveries, and design.

<h3>Machine learning for structure-guided materials and process design</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14552" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14552</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas Morand, Tarek Iraki, Johannes Dornheim, Stefan Sandfeld, Norbert Link, Dirk Helm</i>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in accelerated materials
innovation in both, research and industry. However, to truly add value to the
development of new advanced materials, it is inevitable to take into account
manufacturing processes and thereby tailor materials design approaches to
support downstream process design approaches. As a major step into this
direction, we present a holistic optimization approach that covers the entire
materials process-structure-property chain. Our approach specifically employs
machine learning techniques to address two critical identification problems.
The first is to solve a materials design problem, which involves identifying
near-optimal material structures that exhibit desired macroscopic properties.
The second is to solve a process design problem that is to find an optimal
processing path to manufacture these material structures. Both identification
problems are typically ill-posed, which presents a significant challenge for
solution approaches. However, the non-unique nature of these problems also
offers an important advantage for processing: By having several target
structures that perform similarly well, the corresponding processes can be
efficiently guided towards manufacturing the best reachable structure. In
particular, we apply deep reinforcement learning for process design in
combination with a multi-task learning-based optimization approach for
materials design. The functionality of the approach will be demonstrated by
using it to manufacture crystallographic textures with desired properties in a
metal forming process.

<h3>Quasi-localization and Wannier Obstruction in Partially Flat Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14553</a>
<br>
<i>Jin-Hong Park, Jun-Won Rhim</i>
<p>The localized nature of a flat band is understood by the existence of a
compact localized eigenstate. However, the localization properties of a
partially flat band, ubiquitous in surface modes of topological semimetals,
have been unknown. We show that the partially flat band is characterized by a
non-normalizable compact localized state(NCLS). The partially flat band
develops only in a momentum range, where normalizable Bloch wave functions can
be obtained by the linear combination of the NCLSs. Outside this momentum
region, a ghost flat band, unseen from the band structure, is introduced for
the consistent counting argument with the full set of NCLSs. Then, we
demonstrate that the Wannier function corresponding to the partially flat band
exhibits an algebraic($\sim 1/r^{1+\epsilon}$ in 1D and $\sim
1/r^{3/2+\epsilon}$ in 2D) decay behavior, where $\epsilon$ is a positive
number. Namely, one can have the Wannier obstruction even in a topologically
trivial band if it is partially flat. Finally, we develop a construction scheme
of a tight-binding model of the topological semimetal by designing an NCLS.

<i>Lukas Weissitsch, Stefan Wurster, Martin Stueckler, Timo Mueller, Heinz Krenn, Reinhard Pippan, Andrea Bachmaier</i>
<p>Bulk composites using powder blends of Mn and Bi with equal atomic ratios are
consolidated and severely deformed by high-pressure torsion (HPT). Subsequent
annealing treatments lead to the formation of the ferromagnetic and rare-earth
free hard magnetic {\alpha}-MnBi phase. The initial phase formation is studied
by in-situ high-energy XRD annealing experiments showing a beneficial influence
of HPT-deformation on the amount of {\alpha}-MnBi. The nucleation sites are
strongly increased, thus the volumetric {\alpha}-MnBi phase content exceeds 50
vol.%. A lower HPT-pressure of 2 GPa is found to be preferred over 5 GPa to
obtain high {\alpha}-MnBi contents. Annealing is done with or without applying
an external magnetic field. Additionally, influences of the HPT-induced shear
deformation are discussed and correlated with preferred diffusion path ways
fostering the formation of anisotropic {\alpha}-MnBi phase.

<i>Lukas Weissitsch, Franziska Staab, Karsten Durst, Andrea Bachmaier</i>
<p>Magnets are key materials for the electrification of mobility and also for
the generation and transformation of electric energy. Research and development
in recent decades lead to high performance magnets, which require a finely
tuned microstructure to serve applications with ever increasing requirements.
Besides optimizing already known materials and the search on novel material
combinations, an increasing interest in unconventional processing techniques
and the utilization of magnetic concepts is apparent. Severe plastic
deformation (SPD), in particular by high-pressure torsion (HPT) is a versatile
and suitable method to manufacture microstructures not attained so far, but
entitling different magnetic coupling mechanisms fostering magnetic properties.
In this work, we review recent achievements obtained by HPT on soft and hard
magnetic materials, focusing on powder as starting materials. Furthermore, we
give specific attention to the formation of magnetic composites and highlight
the opportunities of powder starting materials for HPT to exploit magnetic
interaction mechanism.

spin glasses, using the combination of a high precision numerical solution of
the Parisi full replica symmetry breaking equations and a continuous time
Quantum Monte Carlo. We characterize the spin glass order and its low-energy
excitations down to zero temperature. The Heisenberg spin glass has a rougher
energy landscape than its Ising analogue, and exhibits a very slow temperature
evolution of its dynamical properties. We extend our analysis to the doped,
metallic Heisenberg spin glass, which displays an unexpectedly slow spin
dynamics reflecting the proximity to the melting quantum critical point and its
associated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Planckian dynamics.

<h3>Towards a comprehensive understanding of the low energy luminescence  peak in 2D materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Keerthana S Kumar, Ajit Kumar Dash, Hasna Sabreen H, Manvi Verma, Vivek Kumar, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam, Akshay Singh</i>
<p>An intense low-energy broad luminescence peak (L-peak) is usually observed in
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at low temperatures. L-peak has
earlier been attributed to bound excitons, but its origins are widely debated
with direct consequences on optoelectronic properties. To decouple the
contributions of physisorbed and chemisorbed oxygen, organic adsorbates, and
strain on L-peak, we measured a series of monolayer (ML) MoS2 samples
(mechanically exfoliated (ME), synthesized by oxygen-assisted chemical vapour
deposition (O-CVD), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) covered and hBN
encapsulated). Emergence of L-peak below 150 K and saturation of
photoluminescence (PL) intensity with laser power confirm bound nature of
L-peak. Anomalously at room temperature, O-CVD samples show high A-exciton PL
(c.f. ME), but reduced PL at low temperatures, which is attributed to
strain-induced direct-to-indirect bandgap change in low defect O-CVD MoS2.
Further, L-peak redshifts dramatically ~ 130 meV for O-CVD samples (c.f. ME).
These observations are fully consistent with our predictions from density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, considering effects of both strain and
defects, and supported by Raman spectroscopy. In ME samples, charged oxygen
adatoms are identified as thermodynamically favourable defects which can create
in-gap states, and contribute to the L-peak. The useful effect of hBN is found
to originate from reduction of charged oxygen adatoms and hydrocarbon
complexes. This combined experimental-theoretical study allows an enriched
understanding of L-peak and beneficial impact of hBN, and motivates collective
studies of strain and defects with direct impact on optoelectronics and quantum
technologies.

first briefly discusses the theory of spin current driven dissipative magnetic
droplets in ferromagnetic thin films with uniaxial anisotropy. We then
thoroughly review the research literature on magnetic droplets and their
salient features, as measured using electrical, microwave, and synchrotron
techniques, and as envisaged by micromagnetic simulations. We also touch upon a
closely related soliton, the dynamical skyrmion. Finally, we present an outlook

<p>We have looked into cobalt disilicide (CoSi$_2$) as a potential building
block for superconducting quantum circuits. In order to achieve this, we
annealed a thin layer of Co to create 10-105 nm thick microwave cavities from
CoSi$_2$ embedded in the silicon substrate. The cavity properties were measured
as a function of temperature and power. In films measuring 10 and 25 nm, we
find a significant kinetic inductance $L_\mathrm{K}$ with a non-BCS power-law
variation $\delta L_\mathrm{K} \propto T^{4.3 \pm 0.2}$ at low temperatures.
The quality factor of the studied microwave resonances increased almost
linearly with thickness, with two-level systems having very little effect. The
power dependence of kinetic inductance was analyzed in terms of heat flow due
to electron-phonon coupling, which was found stronger than estimated for heat
relaxation by regular quasiparticles.

<p>Macroscopic-scale nanostructures, situated at the interface of nanostructures
and bulk materials, hold significant promise in the realm of thermoelectric
materials. Nanostructuring presents a compelling avenue for enhancing material
thermoelectric performance as well as unlocking intriguing nanoscale phenomena,
including spin-dependent thermoelectric effects. This is achieved while
preserving high power output capabilities and ease of measurements related to
the overall macroscopic dimensions. Within this framework, the recently
developed three-dimensional interconnected nanowire and nanotube networks,
integrated into a flexible polymer membrane, emerge as promising candidates for
macroscopic nanostructures. The flexibility of these composites also paves the
way for advances in the burgeoning field of flexible thermoelectrics. In this
study, we demonstrate that the three-dimensional nanowire networks made of
ferromagnetic metals maintain the intrinsic bulk thermoelectric power of their
bulk constituent even for a diameter reduced to approximately 23 nm.
Furthermore, we showcase the pioneering magneto-thermoelectric measurements of
three-dimensional interconnected nickel nanotube networks. These macroscopic
materials, comprising interconnected nanotubes, enable the development of
large-area devices that exhibit efficient thermoelectric performance, while
their nanoscale tubular structures provide distinctive magneto-transport
properties. This research represents a significant step toward harnessing the
potential of macroscopic nanostructured materials in the field of

<p>We implement circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) with quantum dots in
bilayer graphene, a maturing material platform for semiconductor qubits that
can host long-lived spin and valley states. The presented device combines a
high-impedance ($Z_\mathrm{r} \approx 1 \mathrm{k{\Omega}}$) superconducting
microwave resonator with a double quantum dot electrostatically defined in a
graphene-based van der Waals heterostructure. Electric dipole coupling between
the subsystems allows the resonator to sense the electric susceptibility of the
double quantum dot from which we reconstruct its charge stability diagram. We
achieve sensitive and fast detection with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.5 within
1 ${\mu}\mathrm{s}$ integration time. The charge-photon interaction is
quantified in the dispersive and resonant regimes by comparing the
coupling-induced change in the resonator response to input-output theory,
yielding a maximal coupling strength of $g/2{\pi} = 49.7 \mathrm{MHz}$. Our
results introduce cQED as a probe for quantum dots in van der Waals materials
and indicate a path toward coherent charge-photon coupling with bilayer
graphene quantum dots.

<p>We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each
agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction
with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to
this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is
realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently

<br>
<i>Daan Mulder, Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Thomas E. Ouldridge</i>
<p>We study a finite-time cyclic copy protocol that creates persisting
correlations between a memory and a data bit. The average work to copy the two
states of the data bit consists of the mutual information created between the
memory and data bit after copying, a cost due to the difference between the
initial and final states of the memory bit, and a finite-time cost. At low copy
speeds, the optimal initial distribution of the memory bit matches the bias in
the expected outcome, set by the bias in the data bit and the copying
accuracies. However, if both states of the data are copied with the same
accuracy, then in the high-speed regime copying the unlikely data bit state
becomes prohibitively costly with a biased memory; the optimal initial
distribution is then pushed towards 50:50. Copying with unequal accuracies, at
fixed copy-generated mutual information, yields an opposite yet more effective
strategy. Here, the initial memory distribution becomes increasingly biased as
the copy speed increases, drastically lowering the work and raising the maximum
speed. This strategy is so effective that it induces a symmetry breaking
transition for an unbiased data bit.

<h3>Tunneling spin Nernst effect for a single quantum dot</h3>

<p>We describe theoretically the spin Nernst effect for electrons tunneling to a
quantum dot from a quantum wire with the heat flowing along it. Such a
tunneling spin Nernst effect is shown to take place due to the spin-dependent
electron tunneling produced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Coulomb interaction
of electrons in the quantum dot is taken into account using nonequilibrium
Green's functions and is shown to increase significantly the accumulated spin
in a single quantum dot. The difference of the temperatures as small as tenth
of Kelvin applied to the ends of the quantum wire can lead to the spin
polarization as large as tens of percent.

<h3>Tunneling in ABC trilayer graphene superlattice</h3>

<i>Mouhamadou Hassane Saley, Jaouad El-hassouny, Abderrahim El Mouhafid, Ahmed Jellal</i>
<p>We investigate the transport properties of Dirac fermions in ABC trilayer
graphene {(ABC-TLG)} superlattices. Based on the transfer matrix method and
using the continuity conditions of the system, we calculate the transmission
probabilities {and the corresponding conductance}. In the context of two-band
tunneling, Klein tunneling is observed, but it decreases with an increase in
the number of cells. An interlayer bias opens a gap when the number of cells is
increased. Furthermore, increasing the barrier/well width and the cell number
results in an increase in the number of gaps and oscillations in both two-band
and six-band cases. Asymmetry is found in the scattered transmission due to the
presence of the interlayer bias. The conductance decreases when the number of
cells increases and a gap region is found. Our results indicate that adjusting
the number of cells, the width of the barrier/well, and the barrier heights
makes it possible to control electron tunneling and the gap number in ABC-TLG.
These findings provide valuable insights for the development of electronic
devices using graphene materials.

<h3>Revisiting fluid-wall interfacial tension</h3>

<br>
<i>Longfei Li, Mingcheng Yang</i>
<p>A fluid in contact with a flat structureless wall constitutes the simplest
interface system, but the fluid-wall interfacial tension cannot be trivially
and even unequivocally determined due to the ambiguity in identifying the
precise location of fluid-wall dividing surface. To resolve this long-standing
problem, we here derive the interfacial tension from two independent routes
without needing the identification of dividing surface. The first one exploits
a natural idea that the interfacial profiles of intensive quantities should
remain perfectly invariant when deforming the fluid-wall system just to change
its interface area. The second one considers the fluid-wall system as the limit
of a fluid under a finite external potential field. By calculating the work
required to create a differential interface area, the two methods yield exactly
the same interfacial tension. Thus, our work provides strong evidence that the
fluid-wall interfacial tension can be unambiguously quantified.

<h3>Effective models for dense vortex lattices in the Kitaev honeycomb model</h3>

<br>
<i>David J. Alspaugh, Jean-Noël Fuchs, Anna Ritz-Zwilling, Julien Vidal</i>
<p>We introduce low-energy effective models for dense configurations of vortices
in the Kitaev honeycomb model. Specifically, we consider configurations of
vortices in which vortex-free plaquettes form triangular lattices against a
vortex-full background. Depending on the vortex density, these "dual"
configurations belong to either one of two families classified by translation
and inversion symmetry. As a function of a time-reversal symmetry breaking
term, one family exhibits gapped phases with even Chern numbers separated by
extended gapless phases, while the other exhibits gapped phases with even or
odd Chern numbers, separated by critical points. We construct an effective
model for each family, determine the parameters of these models by fitting the

the Kitaev honeycomb model. We also derive phase diagrams and determine these

<br>

<p>Topological defects are a ubiquitous phenomenon in diverse physical systems.
In nematic liquid crystals (LCs), they are dynamic, physicochemically distinct,
sensitive to stimuli, and are thereby promising for a range of applications.
However, our current understanding of the mechanics and dynamics of defects in
nematic LCs remain limited and are often overwhelmed by the intricate details
of the specific systems. Here, we unify singular and nonsingular line defects
as superelastic rods and combine theory, simulation, and experiment to
quantitatively measure their effective elastic moduli, including line tension,
torsional rigidity, and twist--stretch coefficient. Interestingly, we found
that line defects exhibit a negative twist--stretch coupling, meaning that
twisted line defects tend to unwind under stretching, which is reminiscent of
DNA molecules. A patterned nematic cell experiment further confirmed the above
findings. Taken together, we have established an effective elasticity theory
for nematic defects, paving the way towards understanding and engineering their
deformation and transformation in driven and active nematic materials.

<i>Andreas Redmann, Christian Kurtscheid, Niels Wolf, Frank Vewinger, Julian Schmitt, Martin Weitz</i>
<p>Thermalization of radiation by contact to matter is a well-known concept, but
the application of thermodynamic methods to complex quantum states of light
remains a challenge. Here we observe Bose-Einstein condensation of photons into
the hybridized ground state of a four-site ring potential with coherent tunnel
couplings. In our experiment, the periodically-closed ring lattice superimposed
by a weak harmonic trap for photons is realized inside a spatially structured
dye-filled microcavity. Photons thermalize to room temperature, and above a
critical photon number macroscopically occupy the symmetric linear combination
of the site eigenstates with zero phase winding, which constitutes the ground
state of the system. The mutual phase coherence of photons at different lattice
sites is verified by optical interferometry.

<h3>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson  junctions: Theory</h3>

<br>
<i>Carles Altimiras, Daniel Esteve, Çağlar Girit, Hélène le Sueur, Philippe Joyez</i>
<p>We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson
junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary
time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence
functional. For all parameters looked at, we find a shunted junction is more
superconducting than the same unshunted junction. We find no trace of Schmid's
superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in
the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by
Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that predictions
of an insulating junction in previous works were due to considering Ohmic
environments with no UV cutoff.

<p>Pairing of electrons is ubiquitous in electronic systems featuring attractive
inter-electron interactions, as exemplified in superconductors.
Counter-intuitively, it can also be mediated in certain circumstances by the
repulsive Coulomb interaction alone. Quantum Hall (QH) Fabry-P\'erot
interferometers (FPIs) tailored in two-dimensional electron gas under a
perpendicular magnetic field has been argued to exhibit such unusual electron
pairing seemingly without attractive interaction. Here, we show evidence in
graphene QH FPIs revealing not only a similar electron pairing at bulk filling
factor nu=2 but also an unforeseen emergence of electron tripling characterized
by a fractional Aharonov-Bohm flux period h/3e (h is the Planck constant and e
the electron charge) at nu=3. Leveraging a novel plunger-gate spectroscopy, we
demonstrate that electron pairing (tripling) involves correlated charge
transport on two (three) entangled QH edge channels. This spectroscopy
indicates a quantum interference flux-periodicity determined by the sum of the
phases acquired by the distinct QH edge channels having slightly different
interfering areas. While recent theory invokes the dynamical exchange of
neutral magnetoplasmons -- dubbed neutralons -- as mediator for electron
pairing, our discovery of three entangled QH edge channels with apparent
electron tripling defies understanding and introduces a new three-body problem
for interacting fermions.

<p>Binary metal sulfides are potential material family for exploring high Tc
superconductors under high pressure. In this work, we study the crystal
structures, electronic structures and superconducting properties of the Lu-S
system in the pressure range from 0 GPa to 200 GPa, combining crystal structure
predictions with ab-initio calculations. We predict 14 new structures,
encompassing 7 unidentified stoichiometries. Within the S-rich structures, the
formation of S atom cages is beneficial for superconductivity, with the
superconducting transition temperature 25.86 K and 25.30 K for LuS6-C2/m at 70
GPa and LuS6-R-3m at 90 GPa, respectively. With the Lu/(Lu+S) ratio increases,
the Lu-d electrons participate more in the electronic properties at the Fermi
energy, resulting in the coexistence of superconductivity and topological
non-triviality of LuS2-Cmca, as well as the superconductivity of predicted
Lu-rich compounds. Our calculation is helpful for understanding the exotic
properties in transition metal sulfides system under high pressure, providing
possibility in designing novel superconductors for future experimental and
theoretical works.

<p>The (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series possess natural multilayer
heterostructure with intriguing physical properties at ambient pressure.
Herein, we report the pressure-dependent evolution of the structure and
electrical transport of the dual topological insulator BiTe, a member of the

crystal structures and distinct superconducting states, which is remarkably
similar to other members of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n series. Our results provide a
systematic phase diagram for the pressure-induced superconductivity in BiTe,

<h3>Cavitation in elastomers: A review of the evidence against elasticity</h3>

<br>
<i>Evan Breedlove, Chao Chen, David Lindeman, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</i>
<p>In spite of the growing body of evidence against it, the elasticity view of
the phenomenon of cavitation in elastomers continues to be utilized in numerous
studies. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to provide a
comprehensive review of the existing evidence that settles that cavitation in
elastomers is \emph{not} a purely elastic phenomenon. To that end, a review is
first given of the experimental observations of cavitation in elastomers --
gathered since the 1930s until present times -- as well as of its theoretical
description as an elastic phenomenon -- whose development started in the 1950s
and was substantially completed by the 2010s. The latter is then confronted to
the former to pinpoint the reasons why the elastic behavior of elastomers
cannot possibly explain the experimental observations. The last part of the
paper includes a brief summary of the current view of cavitation as a fracture
phenomenon and an outlook for the field in that direction.

<h3>Local site behavior of the 5d and 4f ions in the frustrated pyrochlore  Ho2Os2O7</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Calder, Z.Y. Zhao, M.H. Upton, J.-Q. Yan</i>
<p>The pyrochlore osmate Ho2Os2O7 is a candidate material for a fragile J=0
local singlet ground state, however little is known regarding the single-ion
behavior of either the Os or Ho ions. To address this we present polarized
neutron powder diffraction (PNPD) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS) measurements that separately probe the local site behavior of the Os and
Ho ions. The PNPD results are dominated by Ho3+ scattering and the analysis
reveals local site susceptibility behavior consistent with spin ice materials.
Complimentary unpolarized neutron powder diffraction show an ordered spin ice
ground state in an applied magnetic field. To isolate the Os4+ single-ion
behavior we present resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at
the osmium L-edge. Analysis of the RIXS spectra parameterize the spin-orbit
coupling (0.35 eV), Hund's coupling (0.27 eV) and trigonal distortion (-0.17
eV). The results are considered within the context of a J=0 model and possible
departures from this through structural distortions, excitonic interactions and
5d-4f interactions between the Os ion and the surrounding Ho lattice. The
experimental methodology employed highlights the complimentary information
available in rare earth based 5d pyrochlores from distinct neutron and x-ray
scattering techniques that allow for the isolation and determination of the
behavior of the different ions.

<h3>SuperVortexNet: Reconstructing Superfluid Vortex Filaments Using Deep  Learning</h3>

<br>
<i>Nick Keepfer, Thomas Flynn, Nick Parker, Thomas Billam</i>
<p>We introduce a novel approach to the three-dimensional reconstruction of
superfluid vortex filaments using deep convolutional neural networks.
Superfluid vortices, quantum mechanical phenomena of immense scientific
interest, are challenging to image due to their small dimensions and intricate
topology. Here, we propose a deep-learning methodology that serves as a
proof-of-principle for fully reconstructing the topology of superfluid vortex
filaments. We have trained a convolutional neural network on a large dataset of
simulated superfluid density images obtained by solving the Gross--Pitaevskii
equation at scale, enabling it to learn the complex patterns and features
inherent to superfluid vortex filaments. The network ingests the integrated
density along the axial, coronal, and sagittal directions and outputs the
reconstructed superfluid vortex filaments in three dimensions. We demonstrate
the success of this approach over a range of vortex densities of simulated
isotropic quantum turbulence, enabling access to the characteristic scaling law
of the decaying vortex line length.

<br>
<i>Sandra Buob, Jonatan Höschele, Vasiliy Makhalov, Antonio Rubio-Abadal, Leticia Tarruell</i>
<p>The development of quantum-gas microscopes has brought novel ways of probing
quantum degenerate many-body systems at the single-atom level. Until now, most
of these setups have focused on alkali atoms. Expanding quantum-gas microscopy
to alkaline-earth elements will provide new tools, such as SU(N)-symmetric
fermionic isotopes or ultranarrow optical transitions, to the field of quantum
simulation. Here, we demonstrate the site-resolved imaging of a $^{84}$Sr
bosonic quantum gas in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The quantum gas is
confined by a two-dimensional in-plane lattice and a light-sheet potential,
which operate at the strontium clock-magic wavelength of 813.4 nm. We realize
fluorescence imaging using the broad 461 nm transition, which provides high
spatial resolution. Simultaneously, we perform attractive Sisyphus cooling with
the narrow 689 nm intercombination line. We reconstruct the atomic occupation
from the fluorescence images, obtaining imaging fidelities above 94%. Finally,
we realize a $^{84}$Sr superfluid in the Bose-Hubbard regime. We observe its
interference pattern upon expansion, a probe of phase coherence, with
single-atom resolution. Our strontium quantum-gas microscope provides a new
platform to study dissipative Hubbard models, quantum optics in atomic arrays,
and SU(N) fermions at the microscopic level.

<h3>Temperature flow in pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization for  quantum spins</h3>

<br>
<i>Benedikt Schneider, Johannes Reuther, Matías G. Gonzalez, Björn Sbierski, Nils Niggemann</i>
<p>We implement the temperature flow scheme first proposed by Honerkamp and
Salmhofer in Phys.~Rev.~B 64, 184516 (2001) into the pseudo-Majorana functional
renormalization group method for quantum spin systems. Since the
renormalization group parameter in this approach is a physical quantity -- the
temperature $T$ -- the numerical efficiency increases significantly compared to
more conventional renormalization group parameters, especially when computing
finite temperature phase diagrams. We first apply this method to determine the
finite temperature phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the
simple cubic lattice where our findings support claims of a vanishingly small
nonmagnetic phase around the high frustration point $J_2=0.25J_1$. Perhaps most
importantly, we find the temperature flow scheme to be advantageous in
detecting finite temperature phase transitions as, by construction, a phase
transition is never encountered at an artificial, unphysical cutoff parameter.
Finally, we apply the temperature flow scheme to the dipolar XXZ model on the
square lattice where we find a rich phase diagram with a large non-magnetic
regime down to the lowest accessible temperatures. Wherever a comparison with
error-controlled (quantum) Monte Carlo methods is applicable, we find excellent
quantitative agreement with less than $5\%$ deviation from the numerically
exact results.

<h3>Simulating a two component Bose-Hubbard model with imbalanced hopping in  a Rydberg tweezer array</h3>

<br>
<i>Y. Zhang, A. Gaddie, H-V. Do, G. W. Biedermann, R. J. Lewis-Swan</i>
<p>Optical tweezer arrays of neutral atoms provide a versatile platform for
quantum simulation due to the range of interactions and Hamiltonians that can
be realized and explored. We propose to simulate a two-component Bose-Hubbard
model with power-law hopping using arrays of multilevel Rydberg atoms featuring
resonant dipolar interactions. The diversity of states that can be used to
encode the local Hilbert space of the Bose-Hubbard model enables control of the
relative hopping rate of each component and even the realization of spin-flip
hopping. We use numerical simulations to show how multilevel Rydberg atoms
provide an opportunity to explore the diverse non-equilibrium quench dynamics
of the model. For example, we demonstrate a separation of the relaxation
timescales of effective spin and charge degrees of freedom, and observe regimes
of slow relaxation when the effective hopping rates of the two components are
vastly different due to dynamical constraints arising from hardcore boson
interactions. We discuss the technical details of realizing our proposal in
state-of-the-art Rydberg tweezer arrays.

<h3>Spurious self-feedback of mean-field predictions inflates infection  curves</h3>

<br>
<i>Claudia Merger, Jasper Albers, Carsten Honerkamp, Moritz Helias</i>
<p>The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and its variants form the
foundation of our understanding of the spread of diseases. Here, each agent can
be in one of three states (susceptible, infected, or recovered), and
transitions between these states follow a stochastic process. The probability
of an agent becoming infected depends on the number of its infected neighbors,
hence all agents are correlated. A common mean-field theory of the same
stochastic process however, assumes that the agents are statistically
independent. This leads to a self-feedback effect in the approximation: when an
agent infects its neighbors, this infection may subsequently travel back to the
original agent at a later time, leading to a self-infection of the agent which
is not present in the underlying stochastic process. We here compute the first
order correction to the mean-field assumption, which takes fluctuations up to
second order in the interaction strength into account. We find that it cancels
the self-feedback effect, leading to smaller infection rates. In the SIR model
and in the SIRS model, the correction significantly improves predictions. In
particular, it captures how sparsity dampens the spread of the disease: this
indicates that reducing the number of contacts is more effective than predicted
by mean-field models.

<h3>Supersonic shear wave imaging in stretched soft strips: modeling for  quantitative elastography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14854" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14854</a>
<br>
<i>Alexandre Delory, Daniel A. Kiefer, Claire Prada, Fabrice Lemoult</i>
<p>Objective - Shear wave elastography has enriched ultrasound medical imaging
with quantitative measurements of tissue stiffness. However, this method still
suffers from some limitations due to viscoelasticity, guiding geometry or
static deformations.
Approach - To explore these limitations, a nearly-incompressible soft
elastomer strip is chosen to mimic the mechanical behavior of an elongated
tissue. A supersonic shear wave scanner measures the propagation of shear waves
within the strip. By repeating the experiment on the same sample for different
orientations and static strains, the scanner estimates the shear wave velocity
in a wide range from 2 to 6 m/s.
Main results - The effect of waveguiding is highlighted and the
spatio-temporal Fourier transform of the raw data provides dispersion diagrams.
We provide a theoretical model that accounts for the static deformation and
allows the extraction of the mechanical parameters of the sample, including its
rheology and hyperelastic behavior.
Significance - To overcome some limitations of current elastography, we
propose a method that would allow the simultaneous characterization of the
viscoelastic and hyperelastic properties of soft tissues, paving the way for
robust quantitative elastography of elongated tissues.

<h3>Generalised $T\bar{T}$-deformations of classical free particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14855</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Doyon, Friedrich Hübner, Takato Yoshimura</i>
<p>Deformations of many-body Hamiltonians by certain products of conserved
currents, referred to as $T\bar{T}$-deformations, are known to preserve
integrability. Generalised $T\bar{T}$-deformations, based on the complete space
of pseudolocal currents, were suggested [B. Doyon, J, Durnin, T. Yoshimura,
Scipost Physics 13, 072 (2022)] to give rise to integrable systems with
arbitrary two-body scattering shifts, going beyond those from known models or
standard CDD factors. However, locality properties were not clear. We construct
explicit generalised $T\bar{T}$-deformations of the system of classical free
particles. We show rigorously that they are Liouville integrable Hamiltonian
systems with finite-range interactions. We show elastic, factorised scattering,
with a two-particle scattering shift that can be any continuously
differentiable non-negative even function of momentum differences, fixed by the
$T\bar{T}$-deformation function. We show that the scattering map (or wave
operator) has a finite-range property allowing us to trace carriers of
asymptotic momenta even at finite times - an important characteristics of
many-body integrability. We evaluate the free energy and prove the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz with Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, including with
space-varying potentials and in finite and infinite volumes. We give equations
for the particles' trajectories where time appears explicitly, generalising the
contraction map of hard rod systems: the effect of generalised
$T\bar{T}$-deformations is to modify the local metric perceived by each
particle, adding extra space in a way that depends on their neighbours. The
systems generalise the gas of interacting Bethe ansatz wave packets recently
introduced in the Lieb-Liniger model. They form a new class of models that, we
believe, most clearly make manifest the structures of many-body integrability.

<br>
<i>Freya Johnson, Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Bryan D. Esser, Aisling Hussey, David W. McComb, Jan Zemen, David Boldrin, Lesley Cohen</i>
<p>Antiferromagnets hosting structural or magnetic order that breaks time
reversal symmetry are of increasing interest for 'beyond von Neumann computing'
applications because the topology of their band structure allows for intrinsic
physical properties, exploitable in integrated memory and logic function. One
such group are the non-collinear antiferromagnets. Essential for domain
manipulation is the existence of small net moments found routinely when the
material is synthesised in thin film form and attributed to symmetry-breaking
caused by spin canting, either from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction or
from strain. Although the spin arrangement of these materials makes them highly
sensitive to strain, there is little understanding about the influence of local
strain fields caused by lattice defects on global properties, such as
magnetisation and anomalous Hall effect. This premise is investigated by
examining non-collinear films that are either highly lattice mismatched or
closely matched to their substrate. In either case, edge dislocation networks
are generated and for the former case these extend throughout the entire film
thickness, creating large local strain fields. These strain fields allow for
finite intrinsic magnetisation in seemly structurally relaxed films and
influence the antiferromagnetic domain state and the intrinsic anomalous Hall
effect.

<h3>Opportunities for the direct manipulation of a phase-driven Andreev spin  qubit</h3>

<br>
<i>Yoan Fauvel, Julia S. Meyer, Manuel Houzet</i>
<p>In a Josephson junction, the transfer of Cooper pairs from one superconductor
to the other one can be associated with the formation of Andreev bound states.
In a Josephson junction made with a semiconducting nanowire, the spin
degeneracy of these Andreev states can be broken thanks to the presence of
spin-orbit coupling and a finite phase difference between the two
superconducting electrodes. The lifting of the spin degeneracy opened the way
to the realization of Andreev spin qubits that do not require the application
of a large magnetic field. So far the operation of these qubits relied on a
Raman process involving two microwave tones and a third Andreev state [M. Hays
et al., Science 373, 430 (2021)]. Still, time-reversal preserving impurities in
the nanowire allow for spin-flip scattering processes. Here, using the
formalism of scattering matrices, we show that these processes generically
couple Andreev states with opposite spins. In particular, the non-vanishing
current matrix element between them allows for the direct manipulation of
phase-driven Andreev spin qubits, thereby circumventing the use of the
above-mentioned Raman process.

<p>$Ab$ $initio$ calculations show the presence of a strong magnetoelectric
interfacial coupling in CaMnO$_3$ ultra-thin film grown on a strained BaTiO$_3$
ferroelectric film. This heterostructure presents a polarization driven
magnetic transition from a G-type to an A-type antiferromagnetic structure.
Together with this magnetic transition we find a metallic behaviour at the
interface between these two insulators, where the charge character of the
carriers can be tuned from electrons to holes by switching the electric
polarization direction of the FE film. Besides, the electron gas is
spin-polarized while the hole-gas is not.

<h3>Large-deviation analysis of rare resonances for the Many-Body  localization transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14873</a>
<br>
<i>Giulio Biroli, Alexander K. Hartmann, Marco Tarzia</i>
<p>A central theoretical issue at the core of the current research on many-body
localization (MBL) consists in characterizing the statistics of rare long-range
resonances in many-body eigenstates. This is of paramount importance to
understand: (i) the critical properties of the MBL transition and the mechanism
for its destabilization through quantum avalanches; (ii) the unusual transport
and anomalously slow out-of-equilibrium relaxation when the transition is
approached from the metallic side. In order to study and characterize such
long-range rare resonances, we develop a large-deviations approach based on an
analogy with the physics of directed polymers in random media, and in
particular with their freezing glass transition on infinite-dimensional graphs.
The basic idea is to enlarge the parameter space by adding an auxiliary
parameter (which plays the role of the inverse temperature in the directed
polymer formulation) which allows us to fine-tune the effect of anomalously
large outliers in the far-tails of the probability distributions of the
transmission amplitudes between far-away many-body configurations in the
Hilbert space. We first benchmark our approach onto two non-interacting
paradigmatic toy models, namely the single-particle Anderson model on the
(loop-less) Cayley tree and the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble, and
then apply it to the study of a class of disordered quantum spin chains in a
transverse field. This analysis shows the existence of a broad disorder range
in which rare, long-distance resonances, that may form only for a few specific
realizations of the disorder and a few specific choice of the random initial
state, destabilize the MBL phase, while the genuine MBL transition is shifted
to much larger values of the disorder than originally thought.

<i>Léo Régnier, Maxim Dolgushev, Olivier Bénichou</i>
<p>We develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing full record statistics,
covering record counts $M(t_1), M(t_2), \ldots$, and their corresponding
attainment times $T_{M(t_1)}, T_{M(t_2)}, \ldots$, as well as the intervals
until the next record. From this multiple-time distribution, we derive general
expressions for various observables related to record dynamics, including the
conditional number of records given the number observed at a previous time and
the conditional time required to reach the current record, given the occurrence
time of the previous one. Our formalism is exemplified by a variety of
stochastic processes, including biased nearest-neighbor random walks,
asymmetric run-and-tumble dynamics, and random walks with stochastic resetting.

<p>We describe a phase-retrieval-based imaging method to directly spatially
resolve the vector lattice distortions in an extended crystalline sample by
explicit coupling of independent Bragg ptychography data sets into the
reconstruction process. Our method addresses this multi-peak Bragg ptychography
(MPBP) inverse problem by explicit gradient descent optimization of an
objective function based on modeling of the probe-lattice interaction, along
with corrective steps to address spurious reconstruction artifacts. Robust
convergence of the optimization process is ensured by computing exact gradients
with the automatic differentiation capabilities of high-performance computing
software packages. We demonstrate MPBP reconstruction with simulated
ptychography data mimicking diffraction from a single crystal membrane
containing heterogeneities that manifest as phase discontinuities in the
diffracted wave. We show the superior ability of such an optimization-based
approach in removing reconstruction artifacts compared to existing phase
retrieval and lattice distortion reconstruction approaches.

improvements, including efficient Metropolis updates for phonon fields based on
analytic insights, which lead to negligible autocorrelation times and allow to
reach sub-permille precisions at small computational cost of $O(1)$ CPU-hour.
In the experimentally relevant range of Hamiltonian parameters and temperatures
the HMC simulations produce charge mobility estimates that are in good
agreement with experiment and with the popular Transient Localisation approach.

<p>We put forward a generalized procedure is which allows to restore the
bulk-like electron and hole wave functions from the wave functions of quantum
confined electron/hole states obtained in atomistic calculations. The procedure
is applied to the lead chalcogenide quantum dots and the effective Hamiltonian
of the exchange interaction for the ground state of an exciton localized in PbS
and PbSe quantum dots was extracted. The results demonstrate that the matrix
elements of intravalley exchange in PbS quantum dots are much more anisotropic
than ones in PbSe.

<p>The interplay of topological electronic band structures and strong
interparticle interactions provides a promising path towards the constructive
design of robust, long-range entangled many-body systems. As a prototype for
such systems, we here study an exactly integrable, local model for a
fractionalized topological insulator. Using a controlled perturbation theory
about this limit, we demonstrate the existence of topological bands of zeros in
the exact fermionic Green's function and show that {in this model} they do
affect the topological invariant of the system, but not the quantized transport
response. Close to (but prior to) the Higgs transition signaling the breakdown
of fractionalization, the topological bands of zeros acquire a finite
``lifetime''. We also discuss the appearance of edge states and edge zeros at
real space domain walls separating different phases of the system. This model
provides a fertile ground for controlled studies of the phenomenology of
Green's function zeros and the underlying exactly solvable lattice gauge theory
illustrates the synergetic cross-pollination between solid-state theory,
high-energy physics and quantum information science.
