Strongly interacting quantum systems can exhibit emergent excitations that
differ qualitatively from their microscopic degrees of freedom. Here we study
an emergent phenomenon that is intrinsic to such systems far from equilibrium:
Namely, the transmutation of attractive interactions into repulsive
interactions. We initialize an attractively interacting Bose gas in a highly
excited and correlated nonthermal state, quench the confining potential, and
measure how the kinetic and total energies evolve after the quench. Although
the bare interactions are attractive, the low-energy degrees of freedom evolve
as if they repel each other: Thus, their kinetic energy paradoxically decreases
as the gas is compressed. We quantify the missing ``phantom'' energy by
benchmarking our experimental results against generalized hydrodynamics (GHD)
calculations. We present evidence that the missing kinetic energy is stored in
very high-momentum modes.

<h3>Effect of Grain Coalescence on Dislocation and Stress Evolution of GaN  Films Grown on Nanoscale Patterned Sapphire Substrates</h3>

Two types of nucleation layers (NLs), including in-situ low-temperature grown
GaN (LT-GaN) and ex-situ sputtered physical vapor deposition AlN (PVD-AlN), are
applied on cone-shaped nanoscale patterned sapphire substrate (NPSS). The
initial growth process of GaN on these two NLs is comparably investigated by a
series of growth interruptions. The coalescence process of GaN grains is
modulated by adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) temperatures. The results
indicate that higher 3D temperatures reduce the edge dislocation density while
increasing the residual compressive stress in GaN films. Compared to the LT-GaN
NLs, the PVD-AlN NLs effectively resist Ostwald ripening and facilitate the
uniform growth of GaN grains on NPSS. Furthermore, GaN films grown on NPSS with
PVD-AlN NLs exhibit a reduction of over 50% in both screw and edge dislocation
densities compared to those grown on LT-GaN NLs. Additionally, PVD-AlN NLs
result in an increase of about 0.5 GPa in the residual compressive stress
observed in GaN films.

The highly tunable nature of synthetic quantum materials -- both in the
solid-state and cold atom contexts -- invites examining which microscopic
ingredients aid in the realization of correlated phases of matter such as
superconductors. Recent experimental advances in moir\'e materials suggest that
unifying the features of the Fermi-Hubbard model and quantum Hall systems
creates a fertile ground for the emergence of such phases. Here, we introduce a
minimal 2D lattice model that incorporates exactly these features:
time-reversal symmetry, band topology, and strong repulsive interactions. By
using infinite cylinder density matrix renormalization group methods (cylinder
iDMRG), we investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model. We find
that it hosts an interaction-induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator and
demonstrate that weakly hole-doping this state gives rise to a superconductor
at a finite circumference, with indications that this behavior persists on
larger cylinders. At the aforementioned circumference, the superconducting
phase is surprisingly robust to perturbations including additional repulsive
interactions in the pairing channel. By developing a technique to probe the
superconducting gap function in iDMRG, we phenomenologically characterize the
superconductor. Namely, we demonstrate that it is formed from the weak pairing
of holes atop the QSH insulator. Furthermore, we determine the pairing symmetry
of the superconductor, finding it to be $p$-wave -- reminiscent of the
unconventional superconductivity reported in experiments on twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG). Motivated by this, we elucidate structural similarities and
differences between our model and those of TBG in its chiral limit. Finally, to
provide a more direct experimental realization, we detail an implementation of
our Hamiltonian in a system of cold fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in an
optical lattice.

<h3>Coulomb-driven band unflattening suppresses $K$-phonon pairing in  moiré graphene</h3>

<br>
It is a matter of current debate whether the gate-tunable superconductivity
in twisted bilayer graphene is phonon-mediated or arises from electron-electron
interactions. The recent observation of the strong coupling of electrons to
so-called $K$-phonon modes in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
experiments has resuscitated early proposals that $K$-phonons drive
superconductivity. We show that the bandwidth-enhancing effect of interactions
drastically weakens both the intrinsic susceptibility towards pairing as well
as the screening of Coulomb repulsion that is essential for the phonon
attraction to dominate at low temperature. This rules out purely
$K$-phonon-mediated superconductivity with the observed transition temperature
of $\sim 1$ K. We conclude that the unflattening of bands by Coulomb
interactions challenges any purely phonon-driven pairing mechanism, and must be
addressed by a successful theory of superconductivity in moir\'e graphene.

<h3>Superconductor-altermagnet memory functionality without stray fields</h3>

A novel class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets, exhibit a
non-relativistically spin-split band structure reminiscent of $d$-wave
superconductors, despite the absence of net magnetization. This unique
characteristic enables utilization in cryogenic stray-field-free memory
devices, offering the possibility of achieving high storage densities. In this
Letter, we determine how a proximate altermagnet influences the critical
temperature $T_c$ of a conventional $s$-wave singlet superconductor.
Considering both a bilayer and trilayer, we show that such hybrid structures
may serve as stray-field free memory devices where the critical temperature is
controlled by rotating the N\'eel vector of one altermagnet, providing infinite
magnetoresistance. Furthermore, our study reveals that altermagnetism can
coexist with superconductivity up to a critical strength of the altermagnetic
order as well as robustness of the altermagnetic influence on the conduction
electrons against non-magnetic impurities, ensuring the persistence of the
proximity effect under realistic experimental conditions.

Probabilistic computing is a novel computing scheme that offers a more
efficient approach than conventional CMOS-based logic in a variety of
applications ranging from optimization to Bayesian inference, and invertible
Boolean logic. The probabilistic-bit (or p-bit, the base unit of probabilistic
computing) is a naturally fluctuating entity that requires tunable
stochasticity; by coupling low-barrier stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions
(MTJs) with a transistor circuit, a compact implementation is achieved. In this
work, through integrating stochastic MTJs with 2D-MoS$_{2}$ FETs, the first
on-chip realization of a key p-bit building block displaying
voltage-controllable stochasticity is demonstrated. In addition, supported by
circuit simulations, this work provides a careful analysis of the three
transistor-one magnetic tunnel junction (3T-1MTJ) p-bit design, evaluating how
the characteristics of each component influence the overall p-bit output. This
understanding of the interplay between the characteristics of the transistors
and the MTJ is vital for the construction of a fully functioning p-bit, making
the design rules presented in this article key for future experimental
implementations of scaled on-chip p-bit networks.

<h3>Ground and Excited Electronic Structures of Electride and Alkalide  Units: The Cases of Metal-Tren, -Azacryptand, and -TriPip222 Complexes</h3>

A systematic electronic structure analysis was conducted for M(L)$_n$
molecular electrides and their corresponding alkalide units M(L)$_n$M' (M/M' =
Na, K and L = Tren, Azacryptand, TriPip222 and $n$ = 1, 2). All complexes
belong to the superalkali category owing to their low ionization potentials.
The saturated molecular electrides display M+(L)n-form with a greatly diffused
quasispherical electron cloud. They were identified as superatoms considering
the contours of populating atomic-type molecular orbitals. The observed
superatomic Aufbau order of M(Tren)$_2$ is 1S, 1P, 1D, 1F, 2S, 2P, and 1G and
it is consistent with those of M(Azacryptand) and M(TriPip222) up to the
analyzed 1F level. Their excitation energies decrease gradually moving from
M(Tren)$_2$ to M(Azacryptand) and to M(TriPip222). The studied alkalide
complexes carry [M(L)$_n$]$^+$M'$^-$ ionic structure and their dissociation
energies vary in the sequence of K(L)$_n$@Na > Na(L)$_n$N@a > K(L)$_n$@K >
Na(L)$_n$@K. Similar to molecular electrides, the anions of alkalide units
occupy electrons in diffuse Rydberg-like orbitals. In this work, excited states
of [M(L)$_n$@M']$^{0,+,-}$ and their trends are also analyzed.

The development of new anti-counterfeiting solutions is a constant challenge
and involves several research fields. Much interest is devoted to systems that
are impossible to clone, based on the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)
paradigm. In this work, new strategies based on electrospinning and
electrospraying of dye-doped polymeric materials are presented for the
manufacturing of flexible free-standing films that embed different PUF keys.
Films can be used to fabricate anticounterfeiting labels having three
encryption levels: i) a map of fluorescent polymer droplets, with non
deterministic positions on a dense yarn of polymer nanofibers; ii) a
characteristic fluorescence spectrum for each label; iii) a challenge-response
pairs (CRPs) identification protocol based on the strong nature of the physical
unclonable function. The intrinsic uniqueness introduced by the deposition
techniques encodes enough complexity into the optical anti-counterfeiting tag
to generate thousands of cryptographic keys. The simple and cheap fabrication
process as well as the multilevel authentication makes such colored polymeric
unclonable tags a practical solution in the secure protection of merchandise in
our daily life.

We map out the ground state phase diagram of the isotropic Kekul{\'e}-Kitaev
model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of the Heisenberg exchange
couplings. Our study relies on large-scale tensor network simulations based on
graph-based projected entangled pair state (gPEPS) approach in the
thermodynamic limit. We find that on top of the quantum spin liquid (QSL) and
conventional magnetically ordered phases which are typical of the
Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the Kekul{\'e}-Heisenberg phase diagram, hosts two
plaquette valance bond solid (VBS) phases with vanishing magnetic order. While
the VBS phases preserve the symmetries of the original Hamiltonian, they differ
markedly from the Kitaev spin liquid by having decorated plaquette ordering
which is distinguished by a plaquette order parameter.

<h3>Strain-Induced Polarization Enhancement in BaTiO$_3$ Core-Shell  Nanoparticles</h3>

Despite fascinating experimental results, the influence of defects and
elastic strains on the physical state of nanosized ferroelectrics is still
poorly explored theoretically. One of unresolved theoretical problems is the
analytical description of the strongly enhanced spontaneous polarization,
piezoelectric response, and dielectric properties of ferroelectric oxide thin
films and core-shell nanoparticles induced by elastic strains and stresses. In
particular, the 10-nm quasi-spherical BaTiO$_3$ core-shell nanoparticles reveal
a giant spontaneous polarization up to 130 mu_C/cm2, where the physical origin
is a large Ti off-centering. The available theoretical description cannot
explain the giant spontaneous polarization observed in these spherical
nanoparticles. This work analyzes polar properties of BaTiO$_3$ core-shell
spherical nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, which
considers the nonlinear electrostriction coupling and large Vegard strains in
the shell. We reveal that a spontaneous polarization greater than 50 mu_C/cm2
can be stable in a (10-100) nm BaTiO$_3$ core at room temperature, where a 5 nm
paraelectric shell is stretched by (3-6)% due to Vegard strains, which
contribute to the elastic mismatch at the core-shell interface. The large
polarization corresponds to very high tetragonality ratios (1.02-1.04), which
is further increased by higher Vegard strains and/or intrinsic surface stresses
leading to unphysically high tetragonality ratios. The nonlinear
electrostriction coupling and the elastic mismatch at the core-shell interface
are key physical factors of the spontaneous polarization enhancement in the
core. Doping with the highly-polarized core-shell nanoparticles can be useful
in optoelectronics and nonlinear optics to increase beam coupling efficiency,
electric field enhancement, reduced switching voltages, ionic contamination
elimination, and catalysis.

<h3>Exciton Superposition across Moiré States in a Semiconducting Moiré  Superlattice</h3>

Moir\'e superlattices of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) enable unprecedented spatial control of electron wavefunctions in an
artificial lattice with periodicities more than ten times larger than that of
atomic crystals, leading to emerging quantum states with fascinating electronic
and optical properties. The breaking of translational symmetry further
introduces a new degree of freedom inside each moir\'e unit cell: high symmetry
points of energy minima called moir\'e sites, behaving as spatially separated
quantum dots. The superposition of a quasiparticle wavefunction between
different moir\'e sites will enable a new platform for quantum information
processing but is hindered by the suppressed electron tunneling between moir\'e
sites. Here we demonstrate the superposition between two moir\'e sites by
constructing an angle-aligned trilayer WSe2/monolayer WS2 moir\'e
heterojunction. The two moir\'e sites with energy minimum allow the formation
of two different interlayer excitons, with the hole residing in either moir\'e
site of the first WSe2 layer interfacing the WS2 layer and the electron in the
third WSe2 layer. An external electric field can drive the hybridization of
either of the interlayer excitons with the intralayer excitons in the third
WSe2 layer, realizing the continuous tuning of interlayer exciton hopping
between two moir\'e sites. Therefore, a superposition of the two interlayer
excitons localized at different moir\'e sites can be realized, which can be
resolved in the electric-field-dependent optical reflectance spectra,
distinctly different from that of the natural trilayer WSe2 in which the
moir\'e modulation is absent. Our study illustrates a strategy of harnessing
the new moir\'e site degree of freedom for quantum information science, a new
direction of twistronics.

<h3>Nonanalytic Corrections to the Landau Diamagnetic Susceptibility</h3>

<br>
<br>
We analyze potential non-analytic terms in the Landau diamagnetic
susceptibility, $\chi_{dia}$, at a finite temperature $T$ and/or finite
magnetic field $H$. To do this, we express the diamagnetic susceptibility as
$\chi_{dia} = (e/c)^2 \lim_{Q\rightarrow0} \Pi^{JJ}_\perp (Q)/Q^2$, where
$\Pi^{JJ}_\perp$ is the transverse component of the static current-current
correlator, and evaluate $\Pi^{JJ}_\perp (Q)$ for a system of fermions with
Hubbard interaction to second order in Hubbard $U$ by combining self energy,
Maki-Thompson, and Aslamazov-Larkin diagrams. We find that at $T=H=0$, the
expansion of $\Pi^{JJ}_\perp (Q)/Q^2$ in $U$ is regular, but at a finite $T$
and/or $H$, it contains $U^2 T$ and/or $U^2 |H|$ terms. Similar terms have been
previously found for the paramagnetic Pauli susceptibility. We obtain the full
expression for the non-analytic $\delta \chi_{dia} (H,T)$ when both $T$ and $H$
are finite, and show that the $H/T$ dependence is similar to that for the Pauli
susceptibility.

<h3>A Deep Dive into the Connections Between the Renormalization Group and  Deep Learning in the Ising Model</h3>

<br>
The renormalization group (RG) is an essential technique in statistical
physics and quantum field theory, which considers scale-invariant properties of
physical theories and how these theories' parameters change with scaling. Deep
learning is a powerful computational technique that uses multi-layered neural
networks to solve a myriad of complicated problems. Previous research suggests
the possibility that unsupervised deep learning may be a form of RG flow, by
being a layer-by-layer coarse graining of the original data. We examined this
connection on a more rigorous basis for the simple example of Kadanoff block
renormalization of the 2D nearest-neighbor Ising model, with our deep learning
accomplished via Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We developed extensive
renormalization techniques for the 1D and 2D Ising model to provide a baseline
for comparison. For the 1D Ising model, we successfully used Adam optimization
on a correlation length loss function to learn the group flow, yielding results
consistent with the analytical model for infinite N. For the 2D Ising model, we
successfully generated Ising model samples using the Wolff algorithm, and
performed the group flow using a quasi-deterministic method, validating these
results by calculating the critical exponent \nu. We then examined RBM learning
of the Ising model layer by layer, finding a blocking structure in the learning
that is qualitatively similar to RG. Lastly, we directly compared the weights
of each layer from the learning to Ising spin renormalization, but found
quantitative inconsistencies for the simple case of nearest-neighbor Ising
models.

We theoretically study topological properties of Floquet magnon in a
laser-irradiated Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnet with the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction by means of the Floquet-Bloch theory. It is
found that the Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet can reveal two topological phases
with different Chern numbers when it is irradiated by a circular-polarized
light laser. Our results show that the topological phase of the system can be
switched from one topological phase to another one via varying the light
intensity. The intrinsic DMI plays a crucial role in the occurrence of
photoinduced topological phase transition. It is shown that the sign reversal
of the thermal hall conductivity is an important indicator on photoinduced
topological phase transitions in the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnet.

Data-driven constitutive modeling frameworks based on neural networks and
classical representation theorems have recently gained considerable attention
due to their ability to easily incorporate constitutive constraints and their
excellent generalization performance. In these models, the stress prediction
follows from a linear combination of invariant-dependent coefficient functions
and known tensor basis generators. However, thus far the formulations have been
limited to stress representations based on the classical Rivlin and Ericksen
form, while the performance of alternative representations has yet to be
investigated. In this work, we survey a variety of tensor basis neural network
models for modeling hyperelastic materials in a finite deformation context,
including a number of so far unexplored formulations which use theoretically
equivalent invariants and generators to Finger-Rivlin-Ericksen. Furthermore, we
compare potential-based and coefficient-based approaches, as well as different
calibration techniques. Nine variants are tested against both noisy and
noiseless datasets for three different materials. Theoretical and practical
insights into the performance of each formulation are given.

We present proof-of-principle experiments of stroboscopic time-of-flight
(TOF) neutron diffraction in long pulsed magnetic fields. By utilizing electric
double-layer capacitors, we developed a long pulsed magnet for neutron
diffraction measurements, which generates pulsed magnetic fields with the full
widths at the half maximum of more than $10^2$ ms. The field variation is slow
enough to be approximated as a steady field within the time scale of a
polychromatic neutron pulse passing through a sample placed in a distance of
the order of $10^1$ m from the neutron source. This enables us to efficiently
explore the reciprocal space using a wide range of neutron wavelength in high
magnetic fields. We applied this technique to investigate field-induced
magnetic phases in the triangular lattice antiferromagnets
CuFe$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$O$_2$ ($x=0, 0.035$).

In magnetic memories, the state of a ferromagnet is encoded in the
orientation of its magnetization. The energy of the system is minimized when
the magnetization is parallel or antiparallel to a preferred (easy) axis. These
two stable directions define the logical bit. Under an external perturbation,
the direction of magnetization can be controllably reversed and thus the bit
flipped. Here, we theoretically design a topological analogue of the magnetic
bit in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-Holstein model, where we show that a
transient external perturbation can lead to a permanent change in the
electronic band topology.

<br>
Electronic liquid-crystal phases are observed in numerous strongly-correlated
systems including high-temperature superconductors. However, identifying these
exotic phases and understanding their interplay with superconductivity in
topological materials remain challenging. Here we employ a cryogenic scanning
tunneling microscopy to discover a smectic (stripe) charge order (CO) and a
primary pair-density-wave (PDW) in topological monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$.
The two orders are spatially modulated unidirectionally at the same wavevector,
but have a marked spatial phase difference of about 2$\pi$/5. Importantly, the
primary PDW state features a two-gap superconductivity below the transition
temperature of 6.0 K and induces another unique particle-hole-symmetric CO at
twice the PDW wavevector. Combining these results and our density functional
calculations, we reveal that the two smectic orders are primarily driven by
nesting behaviors between electron and hole pockets. Our findings establish
monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$ as a topological paradigm for exploring
electronic smecticity, which intertwines with multiple preexisting
symmetry-breaking states.

temperature are observed between the two perovskites. By utilizing X-ray
diffraction and in situ high pressure photoluminescence spectroscopy, we show
that the thermal expansion plays only a minor role on the large bandgap
blueshift due to the enhanced structural stability in our samples. Our
first-principles calculations further demonstrate the significant impact of
thermally induced lattice distortions on the bandgap widening and reveal that
the anomalous trends are caused by the competition between the static and
dynamic distortions. Additionally, both the bandgap renormalization and band
filling effects are directly observed for the first time in fluence-dependent
photoluminescence measurements and are employed to estimate the exciton
effective mass. Our results provide new insights into the basic understanding
of thermal and charge-accumulation effects on the band structure of hybrid
perovskites.

Iron manganese trioxide (FexMn1-x)2O3 nanocrystals were synthesized by the
sol-gel method. The 80 K Mossbauer spectrum was well-fitted using two doublets
representing the 8b and 24d crystallographic sites of the (FexMn1-x)2O3 phase
and two weak extra sextets which were attributed to crystalline and amorphous
hematite. Our findings showed formation of a bixbyite primary phase. The Raman
spectrum exhibits six Raman active modes, typical of (Fe,Mn)2O3, and two extra
Raman modes associated with the secondary hematite phase. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancy onto the
(FexMn1-x)2O3 particle surface, with varying oxidation states. X-band magnetic
resonance data revealed a single broad resonance line in the whole temperature
range (3.8 K - 300 K). The temperature dependence of both resonance field and
resonance linewidth shows a remarkable change in the range of 40 - 50 K, herein
credited to surface spin glass behavior. The model picture used assumes
(FexMn1-x)2O3 nanoparticles with a core-shell structure. Results indicate that
below about 50 K the spin system of shell reveals a paramagnetic to spin
glass-like transition upon cooling, with a critical temperature estimated at 43
K. In the higher temperature range, the superparamagnetic hematite (secondary)
phase contributes remarkably to the temperature dependence of the resonance
linewidth. Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and fieldcooled (FC) data show strong
irreversibility and a peak in the ZFC curve at 33 K, attributed to a
paramagnetic-ferrimagnetic transition of the main phase. Hysteresis curve at 5
K shows a low coercive field of 4 kOe, with the magnetization not reaching
saturation at 70 kOe, suggesting the occurrence of a ferrimagnetic core with a
magnetic disorder at surface, characteristic of core-shell spin-glass-like
behavior.

We investigate symmetry breaking in the Dirac fermion phase of the organic
compound $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ under pressure, where BEDT-TTF denotes
bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene. The exchange interaction resulting from
inter-molecule Coulomb repulsion leads to broken time-reversal symmetry and
particle-hole symmetry while preserving translational symmetry. The system
breaks time-reversal symmetry by creating fluxes in the unit cell. This
symmetry-broken state exhibits a large Nernst signal as well as thermopower. We
compute the Nernst signal and thermopower, demonstrating their consistency with
experimental results.

Glasses offer a broad range of tunable thermophysical properties that are
linked to their compositions. However, it is challenging to establish a
universal composition-property relation of glasses due to their enormous
composition and chemical space. Here, we address this problem and develop a
metamodel of composition-atomistic structure relation of a class of glassy
material via a machine learning (ML) approach. Within this ML framework, an
unsupervised deep learning technique, viz. convolutional neural network (CNN)
autoencoder, and a regression algorithm, viz. random forest (RF), are
integrated into a fully automated pipeline to predict the spatial distribution
of atoms in a glass. The RF regression model predicts the pair correlation
function of a glass in a latent space. Subsequently, the decoder of the CNN
converts the latent space representation to the actual pair correlation
function of the given glass. The atomistic structures of silicate (SiO2) and
sodium borosilicate (NBS) based glasses with varying compositions and dopants
are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and
validate this ML pipeline. The model is found to predict the atom pair
correlation function for many unknown glasses very accurately. This method is
very generic and can accelerate the design, discovery, and fundamental
understanding of composition-atomistic structure relations of glasses and other
materials.

We experimentally observe nonlinear spin polarization in metallic bilayers of
platinum and permalloy by means of spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR)
with the spin-Hall effects. The ST-FMR results under massive dc current
injection contain striking features, which are not caused by extrinsic Joule
heating, but by intrinsic nonlinear spin polarization. The emergence of
nonlinear spin polarization is consistent with observation of unidirectional
spin-Hall magnetoresistance due to magnon generation/annihilation. Moreover,
the magnon generation (annihilation) leads to effective magnetization shrinkage
(expansion) revealed by the ST-FMR measurements. The present study paves a way
to spin-Hall effect based nonlinear spintronic devices as well as
6th-generation mobile communication light sources.

<h3>Predicting Transition Temperature of Superconductors with Graph Neural  Networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
Predicting high temperature superconductors has long been a great challenge.
The difficulty lies in how to predict the transition temperature (Tc) of
superconductors. Although recent progress in material informatics has led to a
number of machine learning models predicting Tc, prevailing models have not
shown adequate generalization ability and physical rationality to find new high
temperature superconductors, yet. In this work, a bond sensitive graph neural
network (BSGNN) was developed to predict the Tc of various superconductors. In
BSGNN, communicative message passing and graph attention methods were utilized
to enhance the model's ability to process bonding and interaction information
in the crystal lattice, which is crucial for the superconductivity.
Consequently, our results revealed the relevance between chemical bond
attributes and Tc. It indicates that shorter bond length is favored by high Tc.
Meanwhile, some specific chemical elements that have relatively large van der
Waals radius is favored by high Tc. It gives a convenient guidance for
searching high temperature superconductors in materials database, by ruling out
the materials that could never have high Tc.

<h3>Magnetic ordering in the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 Nickelate NiRh$_2$O$_4$  prepared via a solid-state metathesis</h3>

<br>
<br>
In spinel-type nickelate NiRh$_2$O$_4$, magnetic ordering is observed upon
the sample synthesized via kinetically controlled low-temperature solid-state
metathesis, as opposed to previously-reported samples obtained through
conventional solid-state reaction. Our findings are based on a combination of
bulk susceptibility and specific heat measurements that disclose a N$\'e$el
transition temperature of $T_N$ = 45 K in this material, which might feature
spin-orbit entanglement in the tetragonally-coordinated $d^8$ Mott insulators.
The emergence of magnetic ordering upon alteration of the synthesis route
indicates that the suppression of magnetic ordering in the previous sample was
rooted in the cation-mixing assisted by the entropy gain that results from
high-temperature reactions. Furthermore, the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 physics, instead
of solely the spin-only $S = 1$, describes the observed enhancement of
effective magnetic moment well. Overseeing all observations and speculations,
we propose that the possible mechanism responsible for the emergent magnetic
orderings in NiRh$_2$O$_4$ is the condensation of $J_{\rm eff}$ = 0 exciton,
driven by the interplay of the tetragonal crystal field and superexchange
interactions.

We report on magnetic and magnetotransport studies of a Kagome ferromagnetic
metal, Fe$_3$Sn. Our studies reveal a large anomalous Hall conductivity
($\sigma_{zx}$) in this system, mainly contributed by temperature independent
intrinsic Hall conductivity ($\sigma^{int}_{zx}$=485$\pm$60 S/cm) and
temperature dependent extrinsic Hall conductivity ($\sigma^{ext}_{zx}$) due to
skew-scattering. Although $\sigma^{ext}_{zx}$ value is large and almost
equivalent to the intrinsic Hall conductivity at low temperatures, it
drastically decreases with increasing temperature, following the relation
$\sigma^{ext}_{zx}=\frac{\sigma_{zx0}^{ext}}{(aT+1)^2}$, under the influence of
electron-phonon scattering. The presence of electron-phonon scattering in this
system is also confirmed by the linear dependence of longitudinal electrical
resistivity at higher temperatures [$\rho(T)\propto T$]. We further find that
Fe$_3$Sn is a soft ferromagnet with an easy-axis of magnetization lying in the
$\it{ab}$ plane of the crystal with magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy
density as large as 1.02 $\times$ 10$^6$

Altermagnetism is a newly identified fundamental class of magnetism with
vanishing net magnetization and time-reversal symmetry broken electronic
structure. Probing the unusual electronic structure with nonrelativistic spin
splitting would be a direct experimental verification of altermagnetic phase.
By combining high-quality film growth and $in~situ$ angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we report the electronic structure of an
altermagnetic candidate, $\alpha$-MnTe. Temperature dependent study reveals the
lifting of Kramers{\textquoteright} degeneracy accompanied by a magnetic phase
transition at $T_N=267\text{ K}$ with spin splitting of up to $370\text{ meV}$,
providing direct spectroscopic evidence for altermagnetism in MnTe.

We report on the tuning of electrical, magnetic, and topological properties
of the magnetic Weyl semimetal (Mn$_{3+x}$Ge) by Fe doping at the Mn site,
Mn$_{(3+x)-\delta}$Fe$_{\delta}$Ge ($\delta$=0, 0.30, and 0.62). Fe doping
significantly changes the electrical and magnetic properties of Mn$_{3+x}$Ge.
The resistivity of the parent compound displays metallic behavior, the system
with $\delta$=0.30 of Fe doping exhibits semiconducting or bad-metallic
behavior, and the system with $\delta$=0.62 of Fe doping demonstrates a
metal-insulator transition at around 100 K. Further, we observe that the Fe
doping increases in-plane ferromagnetism, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and
induces a spin-glass state at low temperatures. Surprisingly, topological Hall
state has been noticed at a Fe doping of $\delta$=0.30 that is not found in the
parent compound or with $\delta$=0.62 of Fe doping. In addition, spontaneous
anomalous Hall effect observed in the parent system is significantly reduced
with increasing Fe doping concentration.

<br>
We investigate the bilayer nickelates as a platform to realize the symmetric
mass generation (SMG) insulator, a featureless Mott insulator that arises due
to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly cancellation in bilayer spin-1/2
lattice systems. Through a single-orbital bilayer square lattice model
involving intralayer hopping $t$ and interlayer superexchange interaction $J$,
we demonstrate the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) upon
doping the SMG insulator. The SC phase features $s$-wave interlayer
spin-singlet pairing and exhibits a crossover between the BCS and BEC limits by
tuning the $J/t$ ratio. We estimate the SC transition temperature $T_c$ from
both the weak and strong coupling limits at the mean-field level. Our findings
offer insights into the experimentally observed decrease in $T_c$ with pressure
and the strange metal behavior above $T_c$. Additionally, we propose that both
Ni $3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals can exhibit superconductivity in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, but their $T_c$ should vary in opposite ways
under doping. This characteristic difference suggests a potential experimental
pathway to identify which electronic orbital plays the principal role in the
formation of superconductivity in this system.

The manipulation of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic order is of significant
importance to facilitate future 2D magnets for low-power and high-speed
spintronic devices. Van der Waals stacking engineering makes promises for
controllable magnetism via interlayer magnetic coupling. However, directly
examining the stacking order changes accompanying magnetic order transitions at
the atomic scale and preparing device-ready 2D magnets with controllable
magnetic orders remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate effective control of
interlayer stacking in exfoliated CrBr$_3$ via thermally assisted strain
engineering. The stable interlayer ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM),
and FM-AFM coexistent ground states confirmed by the magnetic circular
dichroism measurements are realized. Combined with the first-principles
calculations, the atomically-resolved imaging technique reveals the correlation
between magnetic order and interlay stacking order in the CrBr$_3$ flakes
unambiguously. A tunable exchange bias effect is obtained in the mixed phase of
FM and AFM states. This work will introduce new magnetic properties by
controlling the stacking order, and sequence of 2D magnets, providing ample
opportunities for their application in spintronic devices.

Complex strain status can exist in 2D materials during their synthesis
process, resulting in significant impacts on the physical and chemical
properties. Despite their prevalence in experiments, their influence on the
material properties and the corresponding mechanism are often understudied due
to the lack of effective simulation methods. In this work, we investigated the
effects of bending, rippling, and bubbling on the ferroelectric domains in
In2Se3 monolayer by density functional theory (DFT) and deep learning molecular
dynamics (DLMD) simulations. The analysis of the tube model shows that bending
deformation imparts asymmetry into the system, and the polarization direction
tends to orient towards the tensile side, which has a lower energy state than
the opposite polarization direction. The energy barrier for polarization
switching can be reduced by compressive strain according DFT results. The
dynamics of the polarization switching is investigated by the DLMD simulations.
The influence of curvature and temperature on the switching time follows the
Arrhenius-style function. For the complex strain status in the rippling and
bubbling model, the lifetime of the local transient polarization is analyzed by
the autocorrelation function, and the size of the stable polarization domain is
identified. Local curvature and temperature can influence the local
polarization dynamics following the proposed Arrhenius-style equation. Through
cross-scale simulations, this study demonstrates the capability of
deep-learning potentials in simulating polarization for ferroelectric
materials. It further reveals the potential to manipulate local polarization in
ferroelectric materials through strain engineering.

Hydrogels engineered for medical use within the human body need to be
delivered in a minimally invasive fashion without altering their biochemical
and mechanical properties to maximize their therapeutic outcomes. In this
regard, key strategies applied for creating such medical hydrogels include
formulating precursor solutions that can be crosslinked in situ with physical
or chemical cues following their delivery or forming macroporous hydrogels at
sub-zero temperatures via cryogelation prior to their delivery. Here, we
present a new class of injectable composite materials with shape recovery
ability. The shape recovery is derived from the physical properties of red
blood cells (RBCs) that are first modified via hypotonic swelling and then
integrated into the hydrogel scaffolds before polymerization. The RBCs'
hypotonic swelling induces the formation of nanometer-sized pores on their cell
membranes, which enable fast liquid release under compression. The resulting
biocomposite hydrogel scaffolds display high deformability and shape-recovery
ability. The scaffolds can repeatedly compress up to ~87% of their original
volumes during injection and subsequent retraction through syringe needles of
different sizes; this cycle of injection and retraction can be repeated up to
ten times without causing any substantial mechanical damage to the scaffolds.
Our biocomposite material system and fabrication approach for injectable
materials will be foundational for the minimally invasive delivery of
drug-loaded scaffolds, tissue-engineered constructs, and personalized medical
platforms that could be administered to the human body with conventional
needle-syringe systems.

Improving the critical temperature (TC), critical magnetic field (HC), and
critical current (JC) of superconducting materials has always been one of the
most significant challenges in the field of superconductivity, but progress has
been slow over the years. Based on the concept of injecting energy to enhance
electron pairing states, in this study, we have employed a solid-state
sintering method to fabricate a series of smart meta-superconductors (SMSCs)
consisting of p-n junction nanostructures with a wavelength of 550 nm, doped
within an MgB2 matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to pure
MgB2 samples, the critical transition temperature (TC) has increased by 1.2 K,
the critical current (JC) has increased by 52.8%, and the Meissner effect (HC)
shows significant improvement in its diamagnetic properties. This phenomenon of
enhanced superconducting performance can be explained by the coupling between
superconducting electrons and evanescent waves.

<br>
<br>
We present a theory describing the single-ion anisotropy of rare earth (RE)
magnets in the presence of point defects. Taking the RE-lean 1:12 magnet class
as a prototype, we use first-principles calculations to show how the
introduction of Ti substitutions into SmFe$_{12}$ perturbs the crystal field,
generating new coefficients due to the lower symmetry of the RE environment. We
then demonstrate that these perturbations can be described extremely
efficiently using a screened point charge model. We provide analytical
expressions for the anisotropy energy which can be straightforwardly
implemented in atomistic spin dynamics simulations, meaning that such
simulations can be carried out for an arbitrary arrangement of point defects.
The significant crystal field perturbations calculated here demonstrate that a
sample which is single-phase from a structural point of view can nonetheless
have a dramatically varying anisotropy profile at the atomistic level if there
is compositional disorder, which may influence localized magnetic objects like
domain walls or skyrmions.

<br>
The out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir-Polder force between nanoparticles and
dielectric substrates coated with gapped graphene is considered in the
framework of the Dirac model using the formalism of the polarization tensor.
This is an example of physical phenomena violating the time-reversal symmetry.
After presenting the main points of the used formalism, we calculate two
contributions to the Casimir-Polder force acting on a nanoparticle on the
source side of a fused silica glass substrate coated with gapped graphene,
which is either cooler or hotter than the environment. The total nonequilibrium
force magnitudes are computed as a function of separation for different values
of the energy gap and compared with those from an uncoated plate and with the
equilibrium force in the presence of graphene coating. According to our
results, the presence of a substrate increases the magnitude of the
nonequlibrium force. The force magnitude becomes larger with higher and smaller
with lower temperature of the graphene-coated substrate as compared to the
equilibrium force at the environmental temperature. It is shown that with
increasing energy gap the magnitude of the nonequilibrium force becomes
smaller, and the graphene coating makes a lesser impact on the force acting on
a nanoparticle from the uncoated substrate. Possible applications of the
obtained results are discussed.

How strong correlations and topology interplay is a topic of great current
interest. In this perspective paper, we focus on correlation-driven gapless
phases. We take the time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetal as an example
because it is expected to have clear (albeit nonquantized) topological
signatures in the Hall response and because the first strongly correlated
representative, the noncentrosymmetric Weyl-Kondo semimetal Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$,
has recently been discovered. We summarize its key characteristics and use them
to construct a prototype Weyl-Kondo semimetal temperature-magnetic field phase
diagram. This allows for a substantiated assessment of other Weyl-Kondo
semimetal candidate materials. We also put forward scaling plots of the
intrinsic Berry-curvature-induced Hall response vs the inverse Weyl velocity --
a measure of correlation strength, and vs the inverse charge carrier
concentration -- a measure of the proximity of Weyl nodes to the Fermi level.
They suggest that the topological Hall response is maximized by strong
correlations and small carrier concentrations. We hope that our work will guide
the search for new Weyl-Kondo semimetals and correlated topological semimetals
in general, and also trigger new theoretical work.

We report on the dielectric and electrocaloric properties of
Ba$_{1-y}$Ca$_y$Ti$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$O$_3$ for compositions $0.12<x<0.18$ and
$y=0.06$, as well as $x=0.15$ and $0<y<0.15$, synthesized by the conventional
solid-state reaction method. The addition of Hf/Ca broadens the
ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, while moving it toward room
temperature. Two interferroelectric transitions are seen to converge, together
with the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, at ca. 335 K for
$0.12<x_c<0.135$ and $y=0.06$. Consistently with the dielectric properties, the
electrocaloric effect maximizes closer to room temperature with increasing
Hf/Ca substitutions, which promote larger temperature spans. The electrocaloric
responsivity gradually decreases from 0.2 to 0.1 K$~$mm$~$kV$^{-1}$ with the
addition of Hf/Ca. A homemade quasi-adiabatic calorimeter is employed to
measure "directly" the electrocaloric data, which are also calculated from
polarization-versus-electric-field cycles using "indirect" standard procedures.
The comparison between measured and calculated values highlights the importance
of having access to direct methods for a reliable determination of the
electrocaloric effect.

<br>
The adsorption/desorption of ethene (C2H4), also commonly known as ethylene,
on Fe3O4(001) was studied under ultrahigh vacuum conditions using temperature
programmed desorption (TPD), scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) based computations. To
interpret the TPD data, we have employed a new analysis method based on
equilibrium thermodynamics. C2H4 adsorbs intact at all coverages and interacts
most strongly with surface defects such as antiphase domain boundaries and Fe
adatoms. On the regular surface, C2H4 binds atop surface Fe sites up to a
coverage of 2 molecules per (rt2xrt2)R45{\deg} unit cell, with every second Fe
occupied. A desorption energy of 0.36 eV is determined by analysis of the TPD
spectra at this coverage, which is approximately 0.1-0.2 eV lower than the
value calculated by DFT + U with van der Waals corrections. Additional
molecules are accommodated in between the Fe rows. These are stabilized by
attractive interactions with the molecules adsorbed at Fe sites. The total
capacity of the surface for C2H4 adsorption is found to be close to 4 molecules
per (rt2xrt2)R45{\deg} unit cell.

that can be moved by external stimuli such as spin currents and internal
stimuli such as spatial gradients of a material parameter. Since the total
energy of a skyrmion depends linearly on most of these parameters, like the
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, the exchange constant, or the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction strength, a skyrmion will move uniformly in a
weak parameter gradient. In this paper, we show that the linear behavior
changes once the gradients are strong enough so that the magnetic profile of a
skyrmion is significantly altered throughout the propagation. In that case, the
skyrmion experiences acceleration and moves along a curved trajectory.
Furthermore, we show that when spin-orbit torques and material parameter
gradients trigger a skyrmion motion, it can move on a straight path along the
current or gradient direction. We discuss the significance of suppressing the
skyrmion Hall effect for spintronic and neuromorphic applications of skyrmions.
Lastly, we extend our discussion and compare it to a gradient generated by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Measuring large electrical resistances forms an essential part of common
applications such as insulation testing, but suffers from a fundamental
problem: the larger the resistance, the less sensitive a canonical ohmmeter is.
Here we develop a conceptually different electronic sensor by exploiting the
topological properties of non-Hermitian matrices, whose eigenvalues can show an
exponential sensitivity to perturbations. The ohmmeter is realized in an
multi-terminal, linear electric circuit with a non-Hermitian conductance
matrix, where the target resistance plays the role of the perturbation. We
inject multiple currents and measure a single voltage in order to directly
obtain the value of the resistance. The relative accuracy of the device
increases exponentially with the number of terminals, and for large resistances
outperforms a standard measurement by over an order of magnitude. Our work
paves the way towards leveraging non-Hermitian conductance matrices in
high-precision sensing.

Extracting Hamiltonian parameters from available experimental data is a
challenge in quantum materials. In particular, real-space spectroscopy methods
such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy allow probing electronic states with
atomic resolution, yet even in those instances extracting effective Hamiltonian
is an open challenge. Here we show that impurity states in modulated systems
provide a promising approach to extracting non-trivial Hamiltonian parameters
of a quantum material. We show that by combining the real-space spectroscopy of
different impurity locations in a moire topological superconductor, modulations
of exchange and superconducting parameters can be inferred via machine
learning. We demonstrate our strategy with a physically-inspired harmonic
expansion combined with a fully-connected neural network that we benchmark
against a conventional convolutional architecture. We show that while both
approaches allow extracting exchange modulations, only the former approach
allows inferring the features of the superconducting order. Our results
demonstrate the potential of machine learning methods to extract Hamiltonian
parameters by real-space impurity spectroscopy as local probes of a topological
state.

Clean oxide surfaces are generally hydrophilic. Water molecules anchor at
undercoordinated surface metal atoms that act as Lewis-acid sites, and they are
stabilized by H bonds to undercoordinated surface oxygens. The large unit cell
of In2O3(111) provides surface atoms in various configurations, which leads to
chemical heterogeneity and a local deviation from this general rule.
Experiments (TPD, XPS, ncAFM) agree quantitatively with DFT calculations and
show a series of distinct phases. The first three water molecules dissociate at
one specific area of the unit cell and desorb above room temperature. The next
three adsorb as molecules in the adjacent region. Three more water molecules
rearrange this structure and an additional nine pile up above the OH groups.
Despite offering undercoordinated In and O sites, the rest of the unit cell is
unfavorable for adsorption and remains water-free. The first water layer thus
shows ordering into nanoscopic 3D water clusters separated by hydrophobic
pockets.

Motivated by the recent discovery of an intermediate quantum critical phase
between the antiferromagnetic order and the Fermi liquid in the frustrated
Kondo lattice CePdAl, we study here a Kondo-Heisenberg chain with frustrated
$J_1$-$J_2$ XXZ interactions among local spins using the density matrix
renormalization group method. Our simulations reveal a global phase diagram
with rich ground states including the antiferromagnetic order, the
valence-bond-solid and bond-order-wave orders, the pair density wave state, the
uniform superconducting state, and the Luttinger liquid state. We show that
both the pair density wave and uniform superconductivity belong to the family
of Luther-Emery liquids and may arise from pair instability of an intermediate
quantum critical phase with medium Fermi volume in the presence of strong
quantum fluctuations, while the Luttinger liquid has a large Fermi volume. This
suggests a deep connection between the pair density wave, the unconventional
superconductivity, and the non-Fermi liquid quantum critical phase.

Indium oxide offers optical transparency paired with electric conductivity, a
combination required in many optoelectronic applications. The most-stable
In2O3(111) surface has a large unit cell (1.43 nm lattice constant). It
contains a mixture of both bulk-like and undercoordinated O and In atoms and
provides an ideal playground to explore the interaction of surfaces with
organic molecules of similar size as the unit cell. Non-contact atomic force
microscopy (nc-AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density
functional theory (DFT) were used to study the adsorption of Co-phthalocyanine
(CoPc) on In2O3(111). Isolated CoPc molecules adsorb at two adsorption sites in
a 7:3 ratio. The Co atom sits either on top of a surface oxygen ('F
configuration') or indium atom ('S configuration'). This subtle change in
adsorption site induces bending of the molecules, which is reflected in their
electronic structure. According to DFT the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
of the undistorted gas-phase CoPc remains mostly unaffected in the F
configuration but is filled by one electron in S configuration. At coverages up
to one CoPc molecule per substrate unit cell, a mixture of domains with
molecules in F and S configuration are found. Molecules at F sites first
condense into a F-(2x2) structure and finally rearrange into a F-(1x1) symmetry
with partially overlapping molecules, while S-sited molecules only assume a
S-(1x1) superstructure.

Nested sampling is a promising method for calculating phase diagrams of
materials, however, the computational cost limits its applicability if
ab-initio accuracy is required. In the present work, we report on the efficient
use of a neural-network force field in conjunction with the nested-sampling
algorithm. We train our force fields on a recently reported database of silicon
structures and demonstrate our approach on the low-pressure region of the
silicon pressure-temperature phase diagram between 0 and \SI{16}{GPa}. The
simulated phase diagram shows a good agreement with experimental results,
closely reproducing the melting line. Furthermore, all of the experimentally
stable structures within the investigated pressure range are also observed in
our simulations. We point out the importance of the choice of
exchange-correlation functional for the training data and show how the meta-GGA
r2SCAN plays a pivotal role in achieving accurate thermodynamic behaviour using
nested-sampling. We furthermore perform a detailed analysis of the exploration
of the potential energy surface and highlight the critical role of a diverse
training data set.

The state of protonation/deprotonation of surfaces has far-ranging
implications in all areas of chemistry: from acid-base catalysis$^1$ and the
electro- and photocatalytic splitting of water$^2$, to the behavior of
minerals$^3$ and biochemistry$^4$. The acidity of a molecule or a surface site
is described by its proton affinity (PA) and pK$_\mathrm{a}$ value (the
negative logarithm of the equilibrium constant of the proton transfer reaction
in solution). For solids, in contrast to molecules, the acidity of individual
sites is difficult to assess. For mineral surfaces such as oxides they are
estimated by semi-empirical concepts such as bond-order valence sums$^5$, and
also increasingly modeled with first-principles molecular dynamics
simulations$^{6,7}$. Currently such predictions cannot be tested - the
experimental measures used for comparison are typically average quantities
integrated over the whole surface or, in some cases, individual crystal
facets$^8$, such as the point of zero charge (pzc)$^9$. Here we assess
individual hydroxyls on In$_2$O$_3$(111), a model oxide with four different
types of surface oxygen atoms, and probe the strength of their hydrogen bond
with the tip of a non-contact atomic force microscope (AFM). The force curves
are in quantitative agreement with density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations. By relating the results to known proton affinities and
pK$_\mathrm{a}$ values of gas-phase molecules, we provide a direct measure of
proton affinity distributions at the atomic scale.

<h3>Altermagnetic Orbital Chern Insulator in Twisted MoTe$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In twisted MoTe$_{2}$, latest transport measurement has reported observation
of quantum anomalous Hall effect at hole filling $\nu=-1$, which undergoes a
topological phase transition to a trivial ferromagnet as layer hybridization
gets suppressed by interlayer bias $D$. Here we show that this underlies the
existence of an orbital Chern insulating state with gate ($D$) switchable sign
in an altermagnetic spin background at hole filling $\nu=-2$. From
momentum-space Hartree Fock calculations, we find this state has a topological
phase diagram complementary to that of the $\nu=-1$ one: by sweeping $D$ from
positive to negative, the Chern number of this $\nu=-2$ state can be switched
between $+1$, $0$, and $-1$, accompanied by a sign change of a sizable orbital
magnetization. In range of $D$ where this altermagnet is the ground state, the
orbital magnetization allows magnetic field initialization of the spin
altermagnetic order and the Chern number.

It has been reported that slow dynamic nonlinear elastic relaxations, widely
thought to proceed in proportion to the logarithm of time since mechanical
conditioning ceases, recover at a diminished rate at early times, with a time
of transition that varies with the grain size of the material. Here we recount
new observations at short times, in the single bead system, in cement paste and
in sandstone and mortar. Notwithstanding the limits imposed by finite duration
ring down such that the effective instant of conditioning cessation is
imprecise, and the corresponding ambiguity as to the time that relaxation
begins, we find no reliable sign of such a transition, even in samples of large
grain size mortar similar to those described elsewhere as having clear and late
cutoffs.

Macroscopic mechanical properties of polymers are determined by their
microscopic molecular chain distribution. Due to randomness of these molecular
chains, probability theory has been used to find their micro-states and energy
distribution. In this paper, aided by central limit theorem and mixed Bayes
rule, we showed that entropy elasticity based on Gaussian distribution is
questionable. By releasing freely jointed chain assumption, we found that there
is energy redistribution when each bond of a molecular chain changes its
length. Therefore, we have to change Gaussian distribution used in polymer
elasticity to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Since Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution is only a good energy description for gas molecules, we found a
mathematical path to change Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to Fermi-Dirac
distribution based on molecular chain structures. Because a molecular chain can
be viewed as many monomers glued by covalent electrons, Fermi-Dirac
distribution describes the probability of covalent electron occupancy in
micro-states for solids such as polymers. Mathematical form of Fermi-Dirac
distribution is logistic function. Mathematical simplicity and beauty of
Fermi-Dirac distribution make many hard mechanics problems easy to understand.
Generalized logistic function or Fermi-Dirac distribution function was able to
understand many polymer mechanics problems such as viscoelasticity [1],
viscoplasticity [2], shear band and necking [3], and ultrasonic bonding [4].

The ability of thin materials to shape-shift is a common occurrence that
leads to dynamic pattern formation and function in natural and man-made
structures. However, harnessing this concept to design inorganic structures at
the nanoscale rationally has remained far from reach due to a lack of
fundamental understanding of the essential physical components. Here, we show
that the interaction between organic ligands and the nanocrystal surface is
responsible for the full range of chiral shapes seen in colloidal
nanoplatelets. The adsorption of ligands results in incompatible curvatures on
the top and bottom surfaces of NPL, causing them to deform into helico\"ids,
helical ribbons, or tubes depending on the lateral dimensions and
crystallographic orientation of the NPL. We demonstrate that nanoplatelets
belong to the broad class of geometrically frustrated assemblies and exhibit
one of their hallmark features: a transition between helico\"ids and helical
ribbons at a critical width. The effective curvature $\bar{\kappa}$ is the
single aggregate parameter that encodes the details of the ligand/surface
interaction, determining the nanoplatelets' geometry for a given width and
crystallographic orientation. The conceptual framework described here will aid
the rational design of dynamic, chiral nanostructures with high fundamental and
practical relevance.

We have combined the benefits of two catalytic growth phenomena to form
nanostructures of transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTs), materials that are
challenging to grow in a nanostructured form by conventional techniques, as
required to exploit their exotic physics. Our growth strategy combines the
benefits of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth in controlling dimension and growth
location, and salt-assisted growth for fast growth at moderate temperatures.
This salt-assisted VLS growth is enabled through use of a catalyst that
includes Au and an alkali metal halide. We demonstrate high yields of NbS3 1D
nanostructures with sub-ten nanometer diameter, tens of micrometers length, and
distinct 1D morphologies consisting of nanowires and nanoribbons with [010] and
[100] growth orientations, respectively. We present strategies to control the
growth location, size, and morphology. We extend the growth method to
synthesize other TMTs, NbSe3 and TiS3, as nanowires. Finally, we discuss the
growth mechanism based on the relationships we measure between the materials
characteristics (growth orientation, morphology and dimensions) and the growth
conditions (catalyst volume and growth time). Our study introduces
opportunities to expand the library of emerging 1D vdW materials and their
heterostructures with controllable nanoscale dimensions.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is enabled by local surface
plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metallic nanogaps. When SERS is excited by direct
illumination of the nanogap, the background heating of lattice and electrons
can prevent further manipulation of the molecules. To overcome this issue, we
report SERS in electromigrated gold molecular junctions excited remotely:
surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are excited at nearby gratings, propagate to
the junction, and couple to the local nanogap plasmon modes. Like direct
excitation, remote excitation of the nanogap can generate both SERS emission
and an open-circuit photovoltage (OCPV). We compare SERS intensity and OCPV in
both direct and remote illumination configurations. SERS spectra obtained by
remote excitation are much more stable than those obtained through direct
excitation when photon count rates are comparable. By statistical analysis of
33 devices, coupling efficiency of remote excitation is calculated to be around
10%, consistent with the simulated energy flow.

The performance of an organic-semiconductor device is critically determined
by the geometric alignment, orientation, and ordering of the organic molecules.
While an organic multilayer eventually adopts the crystal structure of the
organic material, the alignment and configuration at the interface with the
substrate/electrode material is essential for charge injection into the organic
layer. This work focuses on the prototypical organic semiconductor
para-sexiphenyl (6P) adsorbed on In$_2$O$_3$(111), the thermodynamically most
stable surface of the material that the most common transparent conducting
oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO) is based on. The onset of nucleation and
formation of the first monolayer are followed with atomically-resolved scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM).
Annealing to 200$^\circ$C provides sufficient thermal energy for the molecules
to orient themselves along the high-symmetry directions of the surface, leading
to a single adsorption site. The AFM data suggests a twisted adsorption
geometry. With increasing coverage, the 6P molecules first form a loose network
with poor long-range order. Eventually the molecules re-orient and form an
ordered monolayer. This first monolayer has a densely packed, well-ordered
(2$\times$1) structure with one 6P per In$_2$O$_3$(111) substrate unit cell,
i.e., a molecular density of 5.64$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$.

The recent discovery of a charge density wave order at the wave vector $P$
$(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ has
created a mystery because subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show
a dominant phonon instability instead at another wave vector $H$
$(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, I use first principles
total energy calculations to map out the landscape of the structural
distortions due to the unstable phonon modes at $H$, $L$
$(\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2})$, and $P$ present in this material. In agreement
with previous results, I find that the distortions due to the $H$ instability
cause the largest gain in energy relative to the parent structure, followed in
order by the $L$ and $P$ instabilities. However, only two distinct structure
occur due to this instability, which are separated by 6 meV/f.u. The
instability at $L$ results in three distinct structures separated in energy by
5 meV/f.u. In contrast, six different distorted structures are stabilized due
to the instability at $P$, and they all lie within 2 meV/f.u.\ of each other.
Hence, despite a lower energy gain, the condensation at $P$ could be favorable
due to a larger entropy gain associated with the fluctuations within a manifold
with larger multiplicity via the order-by-disorder mechanism.

Beyond 14GPa of pressure, bi-layered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ was recently found to
develop strong superconductivity above the liquid nitrogen boiling temperature.
An immediate essential question is the pressure-induced qualitative change of
electronic structure that enables the exciting high-temperature
superconductivity. We investigate this timely question via a numerical
multi-scale derivation of effective many-body physics. At the atomic scale, we
first clarify that the system has a strong charge transfer nature with
itinerant carriers residing mainly in the in-plane oxygen between spin-1
Ni$^{2+}$ ions. We then elucidate in eV- and sub-eV-scale the key physical
effect of the applied pressure: It induces a cuprate-like electronic structure
through partially screening the Ni spin from 1 to 1/2. This suggests a
high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with microscopic
mechanism and ($d$-wave) symmetry similar to that in the cuprates.
