<h3>Inclusion statistics and particle condensation in 2 dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08835</a>
<br>
<i>St√©phane Ouvry, Alexios P. Polychronakos</i>

We propose a new type of quantum statistics, which we call inclusion
statistics, in which particles tend to coalesce more than ordinary bosons.
Inclusion statistics is defined in analogy with exclusion statistics, in which
statistical exclusion is stronger than in Fermi statistics, but now
extrapolating beyond Bose statistics, resulting in statistical inclusion. A
consequence of inclusion statistics is that the lowest space dimension in which
particles can condense in the absence of potentials is $d=2$, unlike $d=3$ for
the usual Bose-Einstein condensation. This reduction in the dimension happens
for any inclusion stronger than bosons, and the critical temperature increases
with stronger inclusion. Possible physical realizations of inclusion statistics
involving attractive interactions between bosons may be experimentally
achievable.

<h3>Interaction of Acoustic and Optical Phonons in Soft Bonded Cu-Se  Framework of Large Unit Cell Minerals with Anionic Disorders</h3>

Large unit cell copper-chalcogenide based minerals with high crystalline
anharmonicity have a potential for thermoelectric applications owing to their
inherent poor lattice thermal conductivity. Here, the softening of
copper-selenium bonding and hence crystal framework plays an important role in
superionic conduction and thermal conductivity. We have studied Cu26Nb2Sn6Se32,
Cu26Nb2Sn6Se31.5 and Cu26Nb2Sn6Se30Te2 minerals with a strategically tailored
anionic disorders. These compounds have p-type degenerate behavior with carrier
concentration ranging between 1020 cm-3 at 300 K, high power factor and low
lattice thermal conductivity at 640 K. The existence of two low frequency Raman
active optical modes associated with soft Cu and Se atoms, three localized
Einstein modes in specific heat, suggest high scattering between acoustic and
optical branches with very short phonon lifetime less than 1 ps. The excess
vibrational density of states at low energies with compressed and flat optical
branches strongly hinders the heat transport in these crystalline mineral.
Comparatively, Cu26Nb2Sn6Se30Te2 is a promising thermoelectric material because
of high crystalline anharmonicity and softening of Cu-Se framework due to
heavier tellurium atom.

<h3>Anomalous crystalline ordering of particles in a viscoelastic fluid  under high shear</h3>

Addition of particles to a viscoelastic suspension dramatically alters the
properties of the mixture, particularly when it is sheared or otherwise
processed. Shear-induced stretching of the polymers results in elastic stress
that causes a substantial increase in measured viscosity with increasing shear,
and an attractive interaction between particles, leading to their chaining. At
even higher shear rates, the flow becomes unstable, even in the absence of
particles. This instability makes it very difficult to determine the properties
of a particle suspension. Here we use a fully immersed parallel plate geometry
to measure the high-shear-rate behavior of a suspension of particles in a
viscoelastic fluid. We find an unexpected separation of the particles within
the suspension resulting in the formation of a layer of particles in the center
of the cell. Remarkably, monodisperse particles form a crystalline layer which
dramatically alters the shear instability. By combining measurements of the
velocity field and torque fluctuations, we show that this solid layer disrupts
the flow instability and introduces a new, single-frequency component to the
torque fluctuations that reflects a dominant velocity pattern in the flow.
These results highlight the interplay between particles and a suspending
viscoelastic fluid at very high shear rates.

<h3>Squeezed ensembles and anomalous dynamic roughening in interacting  integrable chains</h3>

It is widely accepted that local subsystems in isolated integrable quantum
systems equilibrate to generalized Gibbs ensembles. Here, we demonstrate the
failure of canonical generalized thermalization for a particular class of
initial states in certain types of interacting integrable models. Particularly,
we show that in the easy-axis regime of the quantum XXZ chain, pure
non-equilibrium initial states with no magnetic fluctuations instead locally
relax to squeezed generalized Gibbs ensembles, referring to exotic equilibrium
states governed by non-local equilibrium Hamiltonians with sub-extensive charge
fluctuations that violate the self-affine scaling. The behaviour at the
isotropic point is exceptional and depends on the initial state. We find that
relaxation from the N\'{e}el state is governed by extensive fluctuations and a
super-diffusive dynamical exponent compatible with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
universality. On the other hand, there are other non-fluctuating initial states
that display diffusive scaling. Our predictions can be directly tested in
state-of-the-art cold atomic experimental settings.

<h3>Operator Product Expansion Coefficients of the 3D Ising Criticality via  Quantum Fuzzy Sphere</h3>

Conformal field theory (CFT) is the key to various critical phenomena. So
far, most of studies focus on the critical exponents of various universalities,
corresponding to conformal dimensions of CFT primary fields. However, other
important yet intricate data such as the operator product expansion (OPE)
coefficients governing the fusion of two primary fields, is largely unexplored
before, specifically in dimensions higher than 2D (or equivalently $1+1$D).
Here, motivated by the recently-proposed fuzzy sphere regularization, we
investigate the operator content of 3D Ising criticality starting from a
microscopic description. We first outline the procedure of extracting OPE
coefficients on the fuzzy sphere, and then compute 13 OPE coefficients of
low-lying CFT primary fields. The obtained results are in agreement with the
numerical conformal bootstrap data of 3D Ising CFT within a high accuracy. In
addition, we also manage to obtain 4 OPE coefficients including $f_{T_{\mu\nu}
T_{\rho\eta} \epsilon}$ that were not available before, which demonstrates the
superior capabilities of our scheme. By expanding the horizon of the fuzzy
sphere regularization from the state perspective to the operator perspective,
we expect a lot of new physics ready for exploration.

<h3>In situ study of iron phase transitions at high pressure and temperature  over millisecond timescales via time-resolved X-ray diffraction</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the phase transitions of iron at high pressure and
high-temperature conditions using a fast-loading dynamic-diamond anvil cell
(dDAC) setup. Using the dDAC apparatus coupled with in situ X-ray diffraction
at the 13-IDD beamline at Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National
Laboratory, we demonstrate compression rates of hundreds of GPa/s and monitor
the structural evolution with millisecond time resolution. This technique
allows us to cover an intermediate compression rate between conventional
static- and dynamic-compression experiments, providing new insight on the
kinetic effects influencing iron phase transitions. Crucially, the dDAC setup
is compatible with doubled-sided laser heating, enabling a detailed
investigation of the pressure-temperature phase diagram under dynamic
compression, as opposed to shock-compression techniques, which are constrained
along the Hugoniot curve. We provide thus the first insight on the $\gamma$ -
$\epsilon$ phase transition (i.e., fcc to hcp) of iron under dynamic loading
and compare the results with the trends observed for the $\alpha$ - $\epsilon$
(i.e., bcc to hcp) phase transition. Our results demonstrate that the specific
deformation mechanism strongly influences the response under dynamic loading.

Strontium niobate has triggered a lot of interest as a transparent conductor
and as a possible realization of a correlated Dirac semi-metal. Using the
lattice parameters as a tunable knob, the energy landscape of octahedral
tilting was mapped using density functional theory calculations. We find that
biaxial compressive strain induces tilting around the out-of-plane axis, while
tensile strain induces tilting around the two in-plane axes. The two competing
distorted structures for compressive strain show semi-Dirac dispersions above
the Fermi level in their electronic structure. Our density functional theory
calculations combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) reveals that
dynamical correlations downshift these semi-Dirac like cones towards the Fermi
energy. More generally, our study reveals that the competition between the
in-phase and out-of-phase tilting in SrNbO$_3$ provides a new degree of freedom
which allows for tuning the thermoelectric and optical properties. We show how
the tilt angle and mode is reflected in the behavior of the Seebeck coefficient
and the plasma frequency, due to changes in the band structure.

<h3>Theory of the in-plane photoelectric effect in quasi-one-dimensional  electron systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08870" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08870</a>

The in-plane photoelectric (IPPE) effect is a recently discovered [Sci. Adv.
\textbf{8}, eabi8398 (2022)] quantum phenomenon which enables efficient
detection of terahertz (THz) radiation in semiconductor structures with a
two-dimensional (2D) electron gas. Here we develop a theory of the IPPE effect
in quasi-one-dimensional electron systems in which the width of the 2D
conducting channel is so small that the transverse quantization energy is
larger than the thermal energy. We calculate the THz photoresponse of such a
system, as a function of the THz frequency, control gate voltages, and
geometrical parameters of the detector. We show that the transverse
quantization of the electron motion manifests itself in oscillating
gate-voltage dependences of the photocurrent, if the THz photon energy is less
than the one-dimensional quantization energy. Results of the theory are
applicable to any semiconductor systems with 2D electron gases, including III-V
structures, silicon-based field effect transistors, and the novel 2D layered,
graphene-related materials.

<h3>Dynamic interfaces for contact-time control of colloidal interactions</h3>

Understanding multibody interactions between colloidal particles out of
equilibrium has a profound impact on dynamical processes such as colloidal self
assembly. However, traditional colloidal interactions are effectively
quasi-static on colloidal timescales and cannot be modulated out of
equilibrium. A mechanism to dynamically tune the interactions during colloidal
contacts can provide new avenues for self assembly and material design. In this
work, we develop a framework based on polymer-coated colloids and demonstrate
that in-plane surface mobility and mechanical relaxation of polymers at
colloidal contact interfaces enable an effective, dynamic interaction.
Combining analytical theory, simulations, and optical tweezer experiments, we
demonstrate precise control of dynamic pair interactions over a range of
pico-Newton forces and seconds timescales. Our model may be used to engineer
colloids with exquisite control over the kinetics and thermodynamics of
colloidal self-assembly dynamics via interface modulation and nonequilibrium
processing.

<h3>Impacts of dielectric screening on the luminescence of monolayer WSe$_2$</h3>

Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe$_2$ have
gathered increasing attention due to their intense electron-hole interactions,
being considered promising candidates for developing novel optical
applications. Within the few-layer regime, these systems become highly
sensitive to the surrounding environment, enabling the possibility of using a
proper substrate to tune desired aspects of these atomically-thin
semiconductors. In this scenario, the dielectric environment provided by the
substrates exerts significant influence on electronic and optical properties of
these layered materials, affecting the electronic band-gap and the exciton
binding energy. However, the corresponding effect on the luminescence of
transition metal dichalcogenides is still under discussion. To elucidate these
impacts, we used a broad set of materials as substrates for single-layers of
WSe$_2$, enabling the observation of these effects over a wide range of
electrical permittivities. Our results demonstrate that an increasing
permittivity induces a systematic red-shift of the optical band-gap of WSe$_2$,
intrinsically related to a considerable reduction of the luminescence
intensity. Moreover, we annealed the samples to ensure a tight coupling between
WSe$_2$and its substrates, reducing the effect of undesired adsorbates trapped
in the interface. Ultimately, our findings reveal how critical the annealing
temperature can be, indicating that above a certain threshold, the heating
treatment can induce adverse impacts on the luminescence. Furthermore, our
conclusions highlight the influence the dielectric properties of the substrate
have on the luminescence of WSe$_2$, showing that a low electrical permittivity
favours preserving the native properties of the adjacent monolayer

<h3>Effusion of stochastic processes on a line</h3>

<br>

We consider the problem of leakage or effusion of an ensemble of independent
stochastic processes from a region where they are initially randomly
distributed. The case of Brownian motion, initially confined to the left half
line with uniform density and leaking into the positive half line is an example
which has been extensively studied in the literature. Here we derive new
results for the average number and variance of the number of leaked particles
for arbitrary Gaussian processes initially confined to the negative half line
and also derive its joint two-time probability distribution, both for the
annealed and the quenched initial conditions. For the annealed case, we show
that the two-time joint distribution is a bivariate Poisson distribution. We
also discuss the role of correlations in the initial particle positions on the
statistics of the number of particles on the positive half line. We show that
the strong memory effects in the variance of the particle number on the
positive real axis for Brownian particles, seen in recent studies, persist for
arbitrary Gaussian processes and also at the level of two-time correlation
functions.

<h3>Dynamical nonlinear excitations induced by interaction quench in a  two-dimensional box-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

<br>
<br>
Manipulating nonlinear excitations, including solitons and vortices, is an
essential topic in quantum many-body physics. A recent progress in this
direction is a new protocol proposed in [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 043256 (2020)] to
produce dark solitons in a one-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) by quenching inter-atomic interaction. Motivated by this work, we
generalize the protocol to a two-dimensional BEC and investigate the general
scenario of its post-quench dynamics. For an isotropic disk trap with a
hard-wall boundary, we find that successive inward-moving ring dark solitons
(RDSs) can be induced from the edge, and the number of RDSs can be controlled
by tuning the ratio of the after- and before-quench interaction strength across
different critical values. The role the quench played on the profiles of the
density, phase, and sound velocity is also investigated. Due to the snake
instability, the RDSs then become vortex-antivortex pairs with peculiar
dynamics managed by the initial density and the after-quench interaction. By
tuning the geometry of the box traps, demonstrated as polygonal ones, more
subtle dynamics of solitons and vortices are enabled. Our proposed protocol and
the discovered rich dynamical effects on nonlinear excitations can be realized
in future cold-atom experiments.

<h3>Dynamically tunable moir√© Rydberg excitons in a monolayer  semiconductor on twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

Moir\'e excitons are emergent optical excitations in 2D semiconductors with
deep moir\'e superlattice potentials. While these excitations have been
realized in several platforms, a system with dynamically tunable moir\'e
potential to tailor the moir\'e exciton properties is yet to be realized. Here,
we present a continuously tunable moir\'e potential in a monolayer WSe2 that is
enabled by its proximity to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the
magic-angle. Due to its flat electronic bands, charge distribution is highly
localized and forms a triangular lattice in TBG. Tuning the local charge
density via electrostatic gating, TBG thus provides a spatially varying and
dynamically tunable dielectric superlattice for modulating monolayer exciton
wavefunctions. By performing optical reflection spectroscopy, we observe
emergent moir\'e exciton Rydberg branches in monolayer WSe2 with increased
energy splitting upon doping TBG. The twist-angle dependence reveals that the
observation is due to a hybridization between bright and dark Rydberg states
enabled by the moir\'e potential. Further, at the magic-angle near 1.1{\deg},
the moir\'e Rydberg excitons form a sawtooth pattern with doping owing to the
formation of strongly correlated states in the TBG. Our study provides a new
platform for engineering moir\'e excitons as well as optical accessibility to
the electronic states with small correlation gaps in TBG.

<h3>Non-perturbative Many-Body Treatment of Molecular Magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09010</a>

Molecular magnets have received significant attention because of their
potential applications in quantum information and quantum computing. A delicate
balance of electron correlation, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), ligand field
splitting, and other effects produces a persistent magnetic moment within each
molecular magnet unit. The discovery and design of molecular magnets with
improved functionalities would be greatly aided by accurate computations.
However, the competition among the different effects poses a challenge for
theoretical treatments. Electron correlation plays a central role, since d-, or
f-element ions, which provide the magnetic states in molecular magnets, often
require explicit many-body treatments. SOC, which expands the dimensionality of
the Hilbert space, can also lead to non-perturbative effects in the presence of
strong interaction. Furthermore, molecular magnets are large, with tens of
atoms in even the smallest systems. We show how an $\textit{ab initio}$
treatment of molecular magnets can be achieved with auxiliary-field quantum
Monte Carlo (AFQMC), in which electron correlation, SOC, and material
specificity are included accurately and on an equal footing. The approach is
demonstrated by an application to compute the zero-field splitting of a
locally-linear Co$^{2+}$ complex.

Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under AC
electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen
Nature 421 513 (2003)]. Tuning the external field drives structural transitions
in the system. Here we consider colloidal fluids comprised of such dipolar
particles in experiment and simulation and investigate their 2-body and
higher-order structure using a variety of probes. The higher--order structure
we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many--body
approach based on minimum energy clusters of a related system. These clusters
exhibit a cascade of geometric transitions upon increasing the strength of the
dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher--order structure of the
concentrated fluids we study here.

<h3>Response Theory Identifies Reaction Coordinates and Explains Critical  Phenomena in Noisy Interacting Systems</h3>

We consider a nonequilibrium system of interacting agents with pairwise
interactions and quenched disorder in the dynamics. Such systems are routinely
used to model collective emergent behaviour in multiple areas of social and
natural sciences as they exhibit, in the thermodynamic limit, both continuous
and discontinuous phase transitions. The goal of this contribution is twofold.
Firstly, we provide a framework to identify suitable reaction coordinates for
the system starting from the microscopic properties of the interaction
structure among the agents. We state conditions on the interactions that lead
to a dimension reduction of the system in terms of a finite number of reaction
coordinates. Secondly, we show that such reaction coordinates prove to be
proper nonequilibrium thermodynamic variables as they carry information on
correlation and memory properties and provide the natural way to probe the
sensitivity of the system to external perturbations. In particular, we prove
that the investigation of response properties of the observables corresponding
to the reaction coordinates allows to identify, pinpoint and characterise phase
transitions of the system as these manifest themselves as singularities in the
corresponding susceptibility function. We apply our theory, corroborated by
numerical evidence, to the investigation of static and dynamic phase
transitions of the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. Our approach allows us to prove
that the dynamic phase transition corresponds to an uncommon scenario of
resonance originating from a non-vanishing real part of the residue associated
to the singular part of the susceptibility. In this setting, the system
exhibits a coherent behaviour characterised by a spontaneously acquired
intrinsic phase, leading to the emergence of a phase shift of the response to
sinusoidal forcings at the critical frequency.

<h3>Revealing a 3D Fermi Surface and Electron-Hole Tunneling in UTe$_{2}$  with Quantum Oscillations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin triplet superconductor UTe$_{2}$ is widely believed to host a
quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, revealed by first principal calculations,
photoemission and quantum oscillation measurements. An outstanding question
still remains as to the existence of a three-dimensional Fermi surface pocket,
which is crucial for our understanding of the exotic superconducting and
topological properties of UTe$_{2}$. This 3D Fermi surface pocket appears in
various theoretical models with different physics origins but has not been
detected experimentally. Here for the first time, we provide concrete evidence
for a relatively isotropic, small Fermi surface pocket of UTe$_{2}$ via quantum
oscillation measurements. In addition, we observed high frequency quantum
oscillations corresponding to electron-hole tunneling between adjacent electron
and hole pockets. The coexistence of 2D and 3D Fermi surface pockets, as well
as the breakdown orbits, provides a test bed for theoretical models and aid the
realization of a unified understanding of superconducting state of UTe$_{2}$
from the first-principles approach.

<h3>Superconducting Diode Effect and Large Magnetochiral Anisotropy in  T$_d$-MoTe$_2$ Thin Film</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the absence of time-reversal invariance, metals without inversion symmetry
may exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport -- a magnetochiral anisotropy that
manifests as unequal electrical resistance for opposite current flow
directions. If superconductivity also sets in, the charge transmission may
become dissipationless in one direction while remaining dissipative in the
opposite, thereby realizing a superconducting diode. Through both DC and AC
magnetoresistance measurements, we study the nonreciprocal effects in thin
films of the superconducting noncentrosymmetric type-II Weyl semimetal
T$_d$-MoTe$_2$. We report nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with
a diode efficiency close to 20\%~, and an extreme magnetochiral anisotropy
coefficient up to \SI{1e9}{\per\tesla\per\ampere}, under weak out-of-plane
magnetic field in the millitesla range. Intriguingly, unlike the finding in
Rashba systems, the strongest in-plane nonreciprocal effect does not occur when
the field is perpendicular to the current flow direction. We develop a
phenomenological theory to demonstrate that this peculiar behavior can be
attributed to the asymmetric structure of spin-orbit coupling in
T$_d$-MoTe$_2$. Our study highlights how the form of spin-orbit coupling, as
dictated by the underlying crystallographic symmetry, critically impacts the
nonreciprocal transport. Our work demonstrates that T$_d$-MoTe$_2$ offers an
accessible material platform for the practical application of superconducting
diodes under a relatively weak magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
Electronic nematicity, a consequence of rotational symmetry breaking, is an
emergent phenomenon in various new materials. In order to fully utilize the
functions of these materials, ability of tuning them through a knob, the
nematic director, is desired. Here we report a successful manipulation of the
nematic director, the vector order-parameter (d-vector), in the spin-triplet
superconducting state of CuxBi2Se3 by magnetic fields. At H = 0.5 T, the ac
susceptibility related to the upper critical field shows a two-fold symmetry in
the basal plane. At H = 1.5 T, however, the susceptibility shows a six-fold
symmetry, which has never been reported before in any superconductor. These
results indicate that the d-vector initially pinned to a certain direction is
unlocked by a threshold field to respect the trigonal crystal symmetry. We
further reveal that the superconducting gap in different crystals converges to
p_x symmetry at high fields, although it differs at low fields.

Viscoelastic materials containing bubbles or drops are encountered in
numerous application fields, and are presently the object of much interest. The
motion of bubbles and drops in these matrices can be significantly different
than in Newtonian fluids. This review is restricted to the case of motion in
quiescent fluids (or small Reynolds number) and of small bubbles and drops,
that are not appreciably deformed during their motion. It includes a brief
description of properties of viscoelastic systems and of the motion of solid
particles in these systems. The case of very small drops undergoing Brownian
motion is related to recent advances in microrheology. The motion of larger
drops and bubbles due to gravity in yield stress fluids is discussed and linked
to Ostwald ripening. Recent advances on the understanding of the rheological
properties of the composite systems are also briefly discussed.

Understanding rapid solidification behavior at velocities relevant to
additive manufacturing (AM) is critical to controlling microstructure
selection. Although in-situ visualization of solidification dynamics is now
possible, systematic studies under AM conditions with microstructural outcomes
compared to solidification theory remain lacking. Here we measure solid-liquid
interface velocities of Ni-Mo-Al alloy single crystals under AM conditions with
synchrotron X-ray imaging, characterize the microstructures, and show
discrepancies with classical theories regarding the onset velocity for absolute
stability of a planar solid-liquid interface. Experimental observations reveal
cellular/dendritic microstructures can persist at velocities larger than the
expected absolute stability limit, where banded structure formation should
theoretically appear. We show that theory and experimental observations can be
reconciled by properly accounting for the effect of solute trapping and kinetic
undercooling on the velocity-dependent solidus and liquidus temperatures of the
alloy. Further theoretical developments and accurate assessments of key
thermophysical parameters - like liquid diffusivities, solid-liquid interface
excess free energies, and kinetic coefficients - remain needed to
quantitatively investigate such discrepancies and pave the way for the
prediction and control of microstructure selection under rapid solidification
conditions.

<h3>Estimation of anisotropic bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature of  crescent curvature-inducing proteins from tethered-vesicle experimental data</h3>

The Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) superfamily proteins have a crescent binding
domain and bend biomembranes along the domain axis. However, their anisotropic
bending rigidities and spontaneous curvatures have not been experimentally
determined. Here, we estimated these values from the bound protein densities on
tethered vesicles using a mean-field theory of anisotropic bending energy and
orientation-dependent excluded volume. The dependence curves of the protein
density on the membrane curvature are fitted to the experimental data for the
I-BAR and N-BAR domains reported by C. Prevost et al. Nat. Commun. 6, 8529
(2015) and F.-C. Tsai et al. Soft Matter 17, 4254 (2021), respectively. For the
I-BAR domain, all three density curves of different chemical potentials exhibit
excellent fits with a single parameter set of anisotropic bending energy. When
the classical isotropic bending energy is used instead, one of the curves can
be fitted well, but the others exhibit large deviations. In contrast, for the
N-BAR domain, two curves are not well-fitted simultaneously using the
anisotropic model, although it is significantly improved from the isotropic
model. This deviation likely suggests a cluster formation of the N-BAR domains.

<h3>Ground-State Phase Diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg Model on a  Three-dimensional Hyperhoneycomb Lattice</h3>

The Kitaev model, which hosts a quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the ground
state, was originally defined on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, but can
be straightforwardly extended to any tricoordinate lattices in any spatial
dimensions. In particular, the three-dimensional (3D) extensions are of
interest as a realization of 3D QSLs, and some materials like
$\beta$-Li$_{2}$IrO$_{3}$, $\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, and $\beta$-ZnIrO$_{3}$ were
proposed for the candidates. However, the phase diagrams of the models for
those candidates have not been fully elucidated, mainly due to the limitation
of numerical methods for 3D frustrated quantum spin systems. Here we study the
Kitaev-Heisenberg model defined on a 3D hyperhoneycomb lattice, by using the
pseudofermion functional renormalization group method. We show that the
ground-state phase diagram contains the QSL phases in the vicinities of the
pristine ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models, in addition to four
magnetically ordered phases, similar to the two-dimensional honeycomb case. Our
results respect the four-sublattice symmetry inherent in the model, which was
violated in the previous study. Moreover, we also show how the phase diagram
changes with the anisotropy in the interactions. The results provide a
reference for the search of the hyperhoneycomb Kitaev materials.

Using light to detect the response of quantum materials is one of the most
versatile tools in modern condensed matter physics. For instance, the injection
current under light illumination can be exploited to probe the topological
properties of materials without inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetry. Rather than
detecting the averaged DC photocurrent response, we propose that the quantum
fluctuation of photocurrent, in the form of DC shot noise (SN), can also be
heard even when the DC photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry. Particularly, we
develop the quantum theory for DC SN for gapped systems and identify four types
of resonant DC SNs at the second order of electric field, dubbed shift SN,
injection SN, jerk SN and snap SN in terms of their dependence on illumination
time. Importantly, the expressions for all SN susceptibility tensors are also
characterized by the gauge-invariant band topological quantities, such as the
local quantum metric, the local Berry curvature, as well as the shift vector,
and amenable to first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we discuss the
symmetry constraints for all SNs and find that they are hardly forbidden by
symmtry like the photocurrent. To illustrate our theory, we investigate the SNs
in time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional materials GeS and MoS$_2$ with
different symmetries. We confirm that the SNs can be heard even when the
photocurrent responses are forbidden by $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry and also reveal
the relevance of band geometric quantities on SNs. Our work show that the
quantum fluctuation of photocurrent can be informative and offer a
complementary tool to characterize the symmetry and topology of quantum
materials.

<h3>Quasi-localized modes in crystalline high entropy alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are designed by mixing multiple metallic species
in nearly the same amount to obtain crystalline or amorphous materials with
exceptional mechanical properties. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations
to investigate the role of positional and compositional disorder in determining
the low-frequency vibrational properties of CrMnFeCoNi HEAs. Our results show
that the expected dependence of the density of states on the frequency as
$D(\omega)\sim\omega^4$ is recovered for amorphous HEAs and is also observed
for partially crystallized alloys with deviations that depend on the degree of
crystallization. We find that the quasi-localized vibrations are still visible
in crystalline HEAs, albeit suppressed compared to the corresponding amorphous
alloys. Our work offers a unified perspective to describe HEA mechanical
properties in terms of their vibrational density of states.

We use non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of
unentangled melts of linear and star polymers ($\mathrm{C_{25}H_{52}}$) to
study the steady-state viscoelastic response under confinement within nanoscale
hematite $\left ( \mathrm{\alpha-Fe_2O_3} \right )$ channels. We report (i) the
negative (positive) first (second) normal stress difference and (ii) the
presence of viscoelastic tension at low shear rates. We link these effects to
bond alignment such that chains near the surface can carry the elastic force
exerted on the walls, which decays as the chains become more aligned in the
flow direction as the shear rate increases.

<br>
<br>
Complex intermetallic materials known as MAX phases exhibit exceptional
properties from both metals and ceramics, largely thanks to their nanolayered
structure. With high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
supported by atomistic modelling, we reveal atomic features of a nano-twist
phase in the nanolayered \MAX. The rotated hexagonal single-crystal is
encompassed within basal symmetric twist interfaces similar to grain
boundaries. In particular, we show that air-oxidation at \SI{1000}{\celsius}
can form a twisted phase that leads to the formation of interfacial dislocation
networks with screw characters or to severe interfacial reconstructions.
Additionally, we explore the contribution of disclinations to the
representation by continuum models of the stress field generated by such
nano-twist defect in the \MAX{} bulk phase. The occurrence of this unexpected
defect is expected to impact the physical response of this nanolayered-based
material as such supports property-by-design approaches.

We investigate the role of quantum coherence and higher harmonics resulting
from multiple-path interference in the context of nonlinear thermoelectricity
in a two-terminal triangular triple-dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer. We
quantify the trade-off between efficiency and power in the nonlinear regime of
our simple setup comprising three non-interacting quantum dots (two of them are
connected to two reservoirs) placed at the vertex of an equilateral triangle
and a magnetic flux $\Phi$ pierces it perpendicularly. For a spatially
symmetric setup, we find that the optimal efficiency and power output can be
obtained when the inter-dot tunneling strength is comparable to the dot-lead
coupling, AB phase $\phi=\pi/2$, and few higher-order quantum interference
patterns or harmonics are present. We find that the presence of higher
harmonics is necessary but not sufficient to achieve optimal power output. The
maximal constructive interference represented by three close-packed resonance
peaks of the unit transmission can enhance the power output
($P_{max}\approx2.35$ $\mathrm{fW}$) almost 3.5 times as compared to the case
where only a single channel participates in the transport, and the
corresponding efficiency is about $0.80\eta_{c}$ where $\eta_{c}$ is the Carnot
efficiency. Geometric asymmetries and their effects on efficiency and power
output are also investigated. An asymmetric setup characterized by the ratio of
the coupling to the source and the drain terminals ($x$) can further enhance
the maximum power output $P_{max}\approx3.85$ $\mathrm{fW}$ for $x=1.5$ with
the same efficiency as that of the symmetric case.

The dynamical structure factor (DSF) represents a measure of dynamical
density-density correlations in a quantum many-body system. Due to the
complexity of many-body correlations and quantum fluctuations in a system of an
infinitely large Hilbert space, such kind of dynamical correlations often
impose a big theoretical challenge. For one dimensional (1D) quantum many-body
systems, qualitative predictions of dynamical response functions are usually
carried out by using the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory. In this
scenario, a precise evaluation of the DSF for a 1D quantum system with
arbitrary interaction strength remains a formidable task. In this paper, we use
the form factor approach based on algebraic Bethe ansatz theory to calculate
precisely the DSF of Lieb-Liniger model with an arbitrary interaction strength
at a large scale of particle number. We find that the DSF for a system as large
as 2000 particles enables us to depict precisely its line-shape from which the
power-law singularity with corresponding exponents in the vicinities of
spectral thresholds naturally emerge. It should be noted that, the advantage of
our algorithm promises an access to the threshold behavior of dynamical
correlation functions, further confirming the validity of nonlinear TLL theory
besides Kitanine et. al. 2012 J. Stat. Mech. P09001. Finally we discuss a
comparison of results with the results from the ABACUS method by J.-S. Caux
2009 J. Math. Phys. 50 095214 as well as from the strongly coupling expansion
by Brand and Cherny 2005 Phys. Rev. A 72 033619.

Quasi-brittle materials endowed with (statistically) self-similar hierarcical
microstructures show distinct failure patterns that deviate from the standard
scenario of damage accumulation followed by crack nucleation-and-growth. Here
we study the failure of paper sheets with hierarchical slice patterns as well
as non-hierarchical and unpatterned reference samples, considering both
uncracked samples and samples containing a macroscopic crack. Failure is
studied under displacement-controlled tensile loading as well as under creep
conditions. Acoustic emission records and surface strain patterns are recorded
alongside stress-strain and creep curves. The measurements demonstrate that
hierarchical patterning efficiently mitigates against strain localization and
crack propagation. In tensile loading, this results in a significantly
increased residual strength of cracked samples. Under creep conditions, for a
given range of lifetimes hierarchically patterned samples are found to sustain
larger creep strains at higher stress levels; their creep curves show unusual
behavior characterized by multiple creep rate minima due to the repeated arrest
of emergent localization bands.

Real Chern insulators have attracted great interest, but so far, their
material realization is limited to nonmagnetic crystals and to systems without
spin-orbit coupling. Here, we reveal magnetic real Chern insulator (MRCI) state
in a recently synthesized metal-organic framework material Co3(HITP)2. Its
ground state with in-plane ferromagnetic ordering hosts a nontrivial real Chern
number, enabled by the C2zT symmetry and robust against spin-orbit coupling.
Distinct from previous nonmagnetic examples, the topological corner zero-modes
of MRCI are spin-polarized. Furthermore, under small tensile strains, the
material undergoes a topological phase transition from MRCI to a magnetic
double-Weyl semimetal phase, via a pseudospin-1 critical state. Similar physics
can also be found in closely related materials Mn3(HITP)2 and Fe3(HITP)2, which
are also existing. Possible experimental detections and implications of an
emerging magnetic flat band in the system are discussed.

Nonlinear density response theory is revisited focusing on the harmonically
perturbed finite temperature uniform electron gas. Within the non-interacting
limit, brute force quantum kinetic theory calculations for the quadratic,
cubic, quartic and quintic responses reveal a deep connection with the linear
response. Careful analysis of the static long wavelength limit led us to
conjecture a canonical non-interacting form that expresses arbitrary order
nonlinear responses as the weighted sum of the linear responses evaluated at
all multiple harmonics. This harmonic expansion is successfully validated
against ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations

Electrides are a unique class of electron-rich materials where excess
electrons are localized in interstitial lattice sites as anions, leading to a
range of unique properties and applications. While hundreds of electrides have
been discovered in recent years, magnetic electrides have received limited
attention, with few investigations into their fundamental physics and practical
applications. In this work, 51 magnetic electrides (12 antiferromagnetic, 13
ferromagnetic, and 26 interstitial-magnetic) were identified using
high-throughput computational screening methods and the latest Material Project
database. Based on their compositions, these magnetic electrides can be
classified as magnetic semiconductors, metals, or half-metals, each with unique
topological states and excellent catalytic performance for N2 fixation due to
their low work functions and excess electrons. The novel properties of magnetic
electrides suggest potential applications in spintronics, topological
electronics, electron emission, and as high-performance catalysts. This work

We treat the general problem of magnetic-field-induced corner states in
quantum spin Hall insulators based on zinc-blende semiconductor quantum wells
(QWs). An analysis performed within the \emph{continuous} Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang
(BHZ) model reveals that the gapped edge states are described by
``generalized'' 1D Dirac equation with \emph{two mass parameters}, whose values
depend on crystallographic orientation of the edge and that of the magnetic
field. Although the mass parameters do not vanish simultaneously, an analytical
solution in the form of ``topological domain wall mode'' confirms the existence
of corner state at the intersection of two adjacent edges. Surprisingly, the
existence of the corner states induced by an in-plane magnetic field do not
require a crystal symmetry of zinc-blende semiconductor QW, making our results
universal for any quantum spin Hall insulators with isotropic edge-state
g-factor. On the contrary, the corner states induced by an out-of-plane
magnetic field arise only due to the absence of an inversion center in
zinc-blende semiconductor QWs.

In this work, we study magnetoelastic interactions by means of ultrasound
experiments in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ -- a prototypical material for the Kitaev spin
model on the honeycomb lattice, with a possible spin-liquid state featuring
Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-flux excitations. We present results of
the temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of the sound velocity
and sound attenuation for several longitudinal and transverse phonon modes
propagating along high-symmetry crystallographic directions. A comprehensive
data analysis above the ordered state provides strong evidence of phonon
scattering by Majorana fermions. This scattering depends sensitively on the
value of the phonon velocities relative to the characteristic velocity of the
low-energy fermionic excitations describing the spin dynamics of the underlying
Kitaev magnet. Moreover, our data displays a distinct reduction of anisotropy
of the sound attenuation, consistent with randomization, generated by thermally
excited $\mathbb{Z}_2$ visons. We demonstrate the potential of phonon dynamics
as a promising probe for uncovering fractionalized excitations in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and provide new insights into the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of
this material.

Laser radiation incident on a ferromagnetic sample produces excited electrons
and currents whose spin polarization must not be aligned with the magnetization
-- an effect due to spin-orbit coupling that is ubiquitous in spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission. In this Paper, we report on a systematic
investigation of the dynamics of spin polarization and spin-polarized currents
produced by femtosecond laser pulses, modeled within our theoretical framework
EVOLVE. The spin polarization depends strongly on the properties of the laser
pulse and on the sample composition, as is shown by comparing results for
Cu(100), Co(100), and a Co/Cu heterostructure. We find a transition from
coherence before the laser pulse's maximum to incoherence thereafter. Moreover,
the time dependence of the spin-polarization components induced by spin-orbit
coupling differ significantly in Cu and Co: in Cu, we find long-period
oscillations with tiny rapid modulations, whereas in Co prominent rapid
oscillations with long period ones are superimposed. The pronounced spatial
dependencies of the signals underline the importance of inhomogeneities, in
particular magnetic/non-magnetic interfaces `act as source' for ultrafast
spin-polarization effects. Our investigation provides detailed insight into
electron dynamics during and shortly after a femtosecond laser excitation.

We investigate the interlayer coupling between two thin ferromagnetic (F)
films mediated by an antiferromagnetic (AF) spacer in F*/AF/F trilayers and
show how it transitions between different regimes on changing the AF thickness.
Employing layer-selective Kerr magnetometry and ferromagnetic-resonance
techniques in a complementary manner enables us to distinguish between three
functionally distinct regimes of such ferromagnetic interlayer coupling. The F
layers are found to be individually and independently exchange-biased for thick
FeMn spacers - the first regime of no interlayer F-F* coupling. F-F* coupling
appears on decreasing the FeMn thickness below 9 nm. In this second regime
found in structures with 6.0-9.0 nm thick FeMn spacers, the interlayer coupling
exists only in a finite temperature interval just below the effective N\'eel
temperature of the spacer, which is due to magnon-mediated exchange through the
thermally softened antiferromagnetic spacer, vanishing at lower temperatures.
The third regime, with FeMn thinner than 4 nm, is characterized by a much
stronger interlayer coupling in the entire temperature interval, which is
attributed to a magnetic-proximity induced ferromagnetic exchange. These
experimental results, spanning the key geometrical parameters and thermal
regimes of the F*/AF/F nanostructure, complemented by a comprehensive
theoretical analysis, should broaden the understanding of the interlayer
exchange in magnetic multilayers and potentially be useful for applications in
spin-thermionics.

Pursuit of superconductivity in light-element systems at ambient pressure is
of great experimental and theoretical interest. In this work, we combine a
machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently
search for the energetically favorable ternary Ca-B-C compounds. Three new
layered borocarbides (stable CaBC5 and metastable Ca2BC11 and CaB3C3) are
predicted to be phonon-mediated superconductors at ambient pressure. The
hexagonal CaB3C3 possesses the highest Tc of 26.05 K among the three compounds.
The {\sigma}-bonging bands around the Fermi level account for the large
electron-phonon coupling ({\lambda} = 0.980) of hexagonal CaB3C3. The ML-guided
approach opens up a way for greatly accelerating the discovery of new high-Tc
superconductors.

<h3>Large deviations for the Pearson family of ergodic diffusion processes  involving a quadratic diffusion coefficient and a linear force</h3>

The Pearson family of ergodic diffusions with a quadratic diffusion
coefficient and a linear force are characterized by explicit dynamics of their
integer moments and by explicit relaxation spectral properties towards their
steady state. Besides the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a Gaussian steady
state, the other representative examples of the Pearson family are the
Square-Root or the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process converging towards the
Gamma-distribution, the Jacobi process converging towards the
Beta-distribution, the reciprocal-Gamma process (corresponding to an
exponential functional of the Brownian motion) that converges towards the
Inverse-Gamma-distribution, the Fisher-Snedecor process, and the Student
process, so that the last three steady states display heavy-tails. The goal of
the present paper is to analyze the large deviations properties of these
various diffusion processes in a unified framework. We first consider the Level
1 concerning time-averaged observables over a large time-window $T$ : we write
the first rescaled cumulants for generic observables and we identify the
specific observables whose large deviations can be explicitly computed from the
dominant eigenvalue of the appropriate deformed-generator. The explicit large
deviations at Level 2 concerning the time-averaged density are then used to
analyze the statistical inference of model parameters from data on a very long
stochastic trajectory in order to obtain the explicit rate function for the two
inferred parameters of the Pearson linear force.

Placed in cavity resonators with three-dimensionally confined electromagnetic
wave, the interaction between quasiparticles in solids can be induced by
exchanging virtual cavity photons, which can have a non-local characteristic.
Here we investigate the possibility of utilizing this nonlocality to realize
the remote control of the topological transition in mesoscopic moir\'{e}
superlattices at full filling (one electron/hole per supercell) embedded in a
split-ring terahertz electromagnetic resonator. We show that gate tuning one
moir\'{e} superlattice can remotely drive a topological band inversion in
another moir\'{e} superlattice not in contact but embedded in the same cavity.
Our study of remote on/off switching of a topological transition provides a
novel paradigm for the control of material properties via cavity vacuum fields.

Molecular-level understanding of the interactions between the constituents of
an atomic structure is essential for designing novel materials in various
applications. This need goes beyond the basic knowledge of the number and types
of atoms, their chemical composition, and the character of the chemical
interactions. The bigger picture takes place on the quantum level which can be
addressed by using the Density-functional theory (DFT). Use of DFT, however, is
a computationally taxing process, and its results do not readily provide easily
interpretable insight into the atomic interactions which would be useful
information in material design. An alternative way to address atomic
interactions is to use an interpretable machine learning approach, where a
predictive DFT surrogate is constructed and analyzed. The purpose of this paper
is to propose such a procedure using a modification of the recently published
interpretable distance-based regression method. Our tests with a representative
benchmark set of molecules and a complex hybrid nanoparticle confirm the
viability and usefulness of the proposed approach.

In this work we study, theoretically, electronic mobility of the silicon
carbide semiconductor in the 3C phase, named 3C-SiC. 3C-SiC has shown great
potential for applications in extreme conditions. Thus, the study of the
electronic mobility of this semiconductor is of great interest. In this work
were theoretically deduced: drift velocity, displacement and mobility of the
charge carriers in the n-type doped 3C-SiC semiconductor, subjected to a
constant electric field. The dependence of these transport properties as a
function of the intensity of the electric field and temperature was analyzed.
For this, a differential equation of motion was used with a source term (low
intensity electric fields) and a term of resistance to movement (electrical
resistance).

Grain boundaries are two-dimensional defects that control many physical and
chemical properties of materials. We build on the recent description of grain
boundaries as defect phases and devise a way to trigger and observe the
transformation of grain boundary phases. The atomistic structure of a symmetric
tilt grain boundary in Mg was resolved by high resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy. By introducing Ga atoms to the grain boundary,
transformations towards other grain boundary phases were tracked. Ab initio
simulations were performed to construct the defect phase diagram for the grain
boundary and understand the progress of their phase transformations. A pattern
recognition tool was developed to compare the experimental and simulated
structural units at the grain boundary and automatically trace the phase
transformation. The ability to construct defect phase diagrams and tune their
phase transformations without changing the geometric confinement of defects
enables a new paradigm of material designs.

<h3>Electronic Excitation Response of DNA to High-energy Proton Radiation in  Water</h3>

The lack of molecular-level understanding for the electronic excitation
response of DNA to charged particle radiation, such as high-energy protons,
remains a fundamental scientific bottleneck in advancing proton and other ion
beam cancer therapies. In particular, the dependence of different types of DNA
damage on high-energy protons represents a significant knowledge void. Here we
employ first-principles real-time time-dependent density functional theory
simulation, using a massively-parallel supercomputer, to unravel the
quantum-mechanical details of the energy transfer from high-energy protons to
DNA in water. The calculations reveal that protons deposit significantly more
energy onto the DNA sugar-phosphate side chains than onto the nucleobases, and
greater energy transfer is expected onto the DNA side chains than onto water.
As a result of this electronic stopping process, highly energetic holes are
generated on the DNA side chains as a source of oxidative damage.

Ruddlesden-Popper and reduced Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates are intriguing
candidates for mimicking the properties of high-temperature superconducting
cuprates. The degree of similarity between these nickelates and cuprates has
been the subject of considerable debate. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS) has played an important role in exploring their electronic and magnetic
excitations, but these efforts have been stymied by inconsistencies between
different samples and the lack of publicly available data for detailed
comparison. To address this issue, we present open RIXS data on La4Ni3O10 and
La4Ni3O8.

<h3>No eigenstate of the critical transverse-field Ising chain satisfies the  area law</h3>

<br>

We argue that, in a basis common to all one-site shift invariant conserved
charges, there is no eigenstate of a noninteracting local spin-1/2 chain
Hamiltonian that satisfies the area law if the ground state has half-integer
central charge. That is to say, in those models all (quasi)local one-site shift
invariant conserved operators are gapless. From the standpoint of bipartite
entanglement properties, we show indeed that there are three distinct one-site
shift invariant noninteracting models, two of which are equivalent to the XX
model (for one of them the transformation breaks one-site shift invariance) and
the other to the critical Ising model. The former class has two locally
distinct one-site shift invariant excited states satisfying the area law; the
latter two classes have none.

Interfacial electron-transfer (ET) reactions underpin the interconversion of
electrical and chemical energy. Pioneering experiments showed that the ET rate
depends on the Fermi Dirac distribution of the electronic density of states
(DOS) of the electrode, formalized in the Marcus Hush Chidsey (MHC) model.
Here, by controlling interlayer twists in well-defined trilayergraphene moires,
we show that ET rates are strikingly dependent on electronic localization in
each atomic layer, and not the overall DOS. The large degree of tunability
inherent to moire electrodes leads to local ET kinetics that range over three
orders of magnitude across different constructions of only three atomic layers,
even exceeding rates at bulk metals. Our results demonstrate that beyond the
ensemble DOS, electronic localization is critical in facilitating interfacial
ET, with implications for understanding the origin of high interfacial
reactivity typically exhibited by defects at electrode electrolyte interfaces.

<h3>Why is EXAFS analysis for multicomponent metals so hard? Challenges and  opportunities for measuring ordering in complex concentrated alloys using  x-ray absorption spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Short range order is a critical driver of properties in multicomponent
alloys, complex concentrated alloys (CCAs). Extended x-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS) is a powerful technique, well suited for quantifying this
short range order. However, CCAs have some characteristics that make the
already challenging analysis of EXAFS data even more difficult. We identify
paths towards robust and scalable quantitative SRO analysis to accelerate
scientific understanding and development of complex, technologically relevant
CCA systems.

We report on speeding up equilibrium recovery in the previously unexplored
general case of the underdamped regime using an optically levitated particle.
We accelerate the convergence towards equilibrium by an order of magnitude
compared to the natural relaxation time. We then discuss the efficiency of the
studied protocols, especially for a multidimensional system. These results pave
the way for optimizing realistic nanomachines with application to sensing and
developing efficient nano-heat engines.
