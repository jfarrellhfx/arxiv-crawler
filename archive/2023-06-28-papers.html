Viscous flow of interacting electrons in two dimensional materials features a
bunch of exotic effects. A model resembling the Navier-Stokes equation for
classical fluids accounts for them in the so called hydrodynamic regime. This
regime occurs when electron-electron collisions are frequent enough. We
performed a detailed analysis of the hydrodynamic requirements and found three
new routes to achieve viscous electron flow: favouring frequent inelastic
collisions, the application of a magnetic field or a high-frequency electric
field. More reflective edges of the material further span the range of validity
of the above conditions. Our results show that the conventional requirement of
frequent electron-electron collisions is too restrictive, and, as a
consequence, materials and phenomena to be described using hydrodynamics are
widened. We discuss recent experiments regarding Poiseuille-like flows,
superballistic conduction and negative resistances as signatures for viscous
flow onset. We conclude that these usual signatures of viscous electron flow
are achieved by following alternative meta-hydrodynamic routes.

The potential barrier model considering an additional current that can lead
to the high-gradient breakdowns in accelerating structures is proposed. An
oscillatory resonance feature of the field emission current from a double-layer
metal system with a nanoscale coating is shown. The double potential barrier
was used for calculations of the field emission current density value. The
presence of resonant properties of the field emission current density of a
double-layer metal system with a nanometric coating is revealed. The field
emission current increasing more than 5 times (for the constant value of an
electric field strength E=5 GV/m) when considering not ideal copper surface
with the presence of nanoclusters on the surface of or nanoscale voids in the
near-surface layer is observed.

Charge injection mechanism from contact electrodes into two-dimensional (2D)
dichalcogenides is an essential topic for exploiting electronics based on 2D
channels, but remains not well understood. Here, low-work-function metal
ytterbium (Yb) was employed as contacts for tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) to
understand the realistic injection mechanism. The contact properties in WS$_2$
with variable temperature (T) and channel thickness (tch) were synergetically
characterized. It is found that the Yb/WS$_2$ interfaces exhibit a strong
pinning effect between energy levels and a low contact resistance ($R_\rm{C}$)
value down to $5\,k\Omega\cdot\mu$m. Cryogenic electrical measurements reveal
that $R_\rm{C}$ exhibits weakly positive dependence on T till 77 K, as well as
a weakly negative correlation with tch. In contrast to the non-negligible
$R_\rm{C}$ values extracted, an unexpectedly low effective thermal injection
barrier of 36 meV is estimated, indicating the presence of significant
tunneling injection in subthreshold regime and the inapplicability of the pure
thermionic emission model to estimate the height of injection barrier.

<h3>A nanogapped hysteresis-free field-effect transistor</h3>

We propose a semi-suspended device structure and construct nanogapped,
hysteresis-free field-effect transistors (FETs), based on the van der Waals
stacking technique. The structure, which features a semi-suspended channel
above a submicron-long wedge-like nanogap, is fulfilled by transferring
ultraclean BN-supported MoS$_2$ channels directly onto dielectric-spaced
vertical source/drain stacks. Electronic characterization and analyses reveal a
high overall device quality, including ultraclean channel interfaces,
negligible electrical scanning hysteresis, and Ohmic contacts in the
structures. The unique hollow FET structure holds the potential for exploiting
reliable electronics, as well as nanofluid and pressure sensors.

Device passivation through ultraclean hexagonal BN encapsulation is proven
one of the most effective ways for constructing high-quality devices with
atomically thin semiconductors that preserves the ultraclean interface quality
and intrinsic charge transport behavior. However, it remains challenging to
integrate lithography compatible contact electrodes with flexible distributions
and patterns. Here, we report the feasibility in straightforwardly integrating
lithography defined contacts into BN encapsulated 2D FETs, giving rise to
overall device quality comparable to the state-of-the-art results from the
painstaking pure dry transfer processing. Electronic characterization on FETs
consisting of WSe$_2$ and MoS$_2$ channels reveals an extremely low scanning
hysteresis of ca. 2 mV on average, a low density of interfacial charged
impurity of ca. $10^{11}\,$cm$^{-2}$, and generally high charge mobilities over
$1000\,$cm$^{2}\cdot$V$^{-1}\cdot$s$^{-1}$ at low temperatures. The overall
high device qualities verify the viability in directly integrating lithography
defined contacts into BN encapsulated devices to exploit their intrinsic charge
transport properties for advanced electronics.

Topological insulators and giant spin-orbit toque switching of nanomagnets
are one of the frontier topics for the development of energy-efficient
spintronic devices. Spin-circuit representations involving different materials
and phenomena are quite well-established now for its prowess of interpreting
experimental results and then designing complex and efficient functional
devices. Here, we construct the spin-circuit representation of spin pumping
into topological insulators considering both the bulk and surface states with
parallel channels, which allows the interpretation of practical experimental
results. We show that the high increase in effective spin mixing conductance
and inverse spin Hall voltages cannot be explained by the low-conductive bulk
states of topological insulators. We determine high spin Hall angle close to
the maximum magnitude of one from experimental results and with an eye to
design efficient spin devices, we further employ a spin-sink layer in the
spin-circuit formalism to increase the effective spin mixing conductance at low
thicknesses and double the inverse spin Hall voltage.

The electronic orders appearing in condensed matter systems are originating
from the precise arrangement of atoms constituting the crystal as well as their
nature. This teneous relationship can lead to highly different phases in
condensed matter, and drive electronic phase transitions. Here, we show that a
very slight deformation of the crystal structure of TbTe$_3$ can have a
dramatic influence on the electronic order that is stabilized. In particular,
we show that the Charge Density Wave (CDW) developping along the $\vec{c}$ axis
in the pristine state, switches to an orientation along $\vec{a}$ when the
naturally orthorhombic system is turned into a tetragonal system. This is
achieved by performing true biaxial mechanical deformation of a TbTe$_3$ sample
from 250K to 375K, and by measuring both structural and electronic parameters
with x-ray diffraction and transport measurements. We show that this switching
transition is driven by the tetragonality parameter $a/c$, and that the
transition occurs for $a=c$, with a coexistence region for $0.9985< a/c <
1.002$. The CDW transition temperature $T_c$ is found to have a linear
dependence with $a/c$, with no saturation in the deformed states investigated
here, while the gap saturates out of the coexistence region. The linear
dependence of $T_c$ is accounted for within a tight-binding model. Our results
question the relationship between the gap and $T_c$ in RTe$_3$ systems. More
generally, our method of applying true biaxial deformation at cryogenic
temperatures can be applied to many systems displaying electronic phase
transitions, and opens a new route towards the study of coexisting or competing
electronic orders in condensed matter.

<h3>Spin-orbital Jahn-Teller bipolarons</h3>

<br>
Polarons and spin-orbit (SO) coupling are distinct quantum effects that play
a critical role in charge transport and spin-orbitronics. Polarons originate
from strong electron-phonon interaction and are ubiquitous in polarizable
materials featuring electron localization, in particular $\mathrm{3d}$
transition metal oxides (TMOs). On the other hand, the relativistic coupling
between the spin and orbital angular momentum is notable in lattices with heavy
atoms and develops in $\mathrm{5d}$ TMOs, where electrons are spatially
delocalized. Here we combine ab initio calculations and magnetic measurements
to show that these two seemingly mutually exclusive interactions are entangled
in the electron-doped SO-coupled Mott insulator
$\mathrm{Ba_2Na_{1-x}Ca_xOsO_6}$ ($0< x < 1$), unveiling the formation of
spin-orbital bipolarons. Polaron charge trapping, favoured by the Jahn-Teller
lattice activity, converts the Os $\mathrm{5d^1}$ spin-orbital
$\mathrm{J_{eff}=3/2}$ levels, characteristic of the parent compound
$\mathrm{Ba_2NaOsO_6}$ (BNOO), into a bipolaron $\mathrm{5d^2}$
$\mathrm{J_{eff}=2}$ manifold, leading to the coexistence of different
J-effective states in a single-phase material. The gradual increase of
bipolarons with increasing doping creates robust in-gap states that prevents
the transition to a metal phase even at ultrahigh doping, thus preserving the
Mott gap across the entire doping range from $\mathrm{d^1}$ BNOO to
$\mathrm{d^2}$ $\mathrm{Ba_2CaOsO_6}$ (BCOO).

<h3>Formation of droplets of the order parameter and superconductivity in  inhomogeneous Fermi-Bose mixtures (Brief review)</h3>

<br>
<br>
The studies of a number of systems treated in terms of an inhomogeneous
(spatially separated) Fermi-Bose mixture with superconducting clusters or
droplets of the order parameter in a host medium with unpaired normal states
are reviewed. A spatially separated Fermi-Bose mixture is relevant to
superconducting BaKBiO3 bismuth oxides. Droplets of the order parameter can
occur in thin films of a dirty metal, described in the framework of the
strongly attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model at a low electron density
with a clearly pronounced diagonal disorder. The Bose-Einstein condensate
droplets are formed in mixtures and dipole gases with an imbalance in the
densities of the Fermi and Bose components. The Bose-Einstein condensate
clusters also arise at the center or at the periphery of a magnetic trap
involving spin-polarized Fermi gases. Exciton and plasmon collapsing droplets
can emerge in the presence of the exciton-exciton or plasmon-plasmon
interaction. The plasmon contribution to the charge screening in MgB2 leads to
the formation of spatially modulated inhomogeneous structures. In metallic
hydrogen and metal hydrides, droplets can be formed in shock-wave experiments
at the boundary of the first-order phase transition between the metallic and
molecular phases. In a spatially separated Fermi-Bose mixture arising in an
Aharonov-Bohm interference ring with a superconducting bridge in a
topologically nontrivial state, additional Fano resonances may appear and
collapse due to the presence of edge Majorana modes in the system.

<br>
The optical and electronic properties of multilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides differ significantly from their monolayer counterparts due to
interlayer interactions. The separation of individual layers can be tuned in a
controlled way by applying pressure. Here, we use a diamond anvil cell to
compress bilayers of 2H-MoS$_2$ in the gigapascal range. By measuring optical
transmission spectra, we find that increasing pressure leads to a decrease in
the energy splitting between the A and interlayer exciton. Comparing our
experimental findings with ab initio calculations, we conclude that the
observed changes are not due to the commonly assumed hydrostatic compression.
This effect is attributed to the MoS$_2$ bilayer adhering to the diamond, which
reduces in-plane compression. Moreover, we demonstrate that the distinct
real-space distributions and resulting contributions from the valence band
account for the different pressure dependencies of the inter- and intralayer
excitons in compressed MoS$_2$ bilayers.

We demonstrate a microwave power-to-electrical energy conversion in a
resonator-coupled double quantum dot system. The system operated as a
photodiode, converts individual microwave photons to electrons tunneling
through the double dot, resulting in an electrical current flowing against the
applied voltage bias at input powers down to 1 femto-watt level. The device
attains a maximum power harvesting efficiency of 2%, with the
photon-to-electron conversion efficiency reaching 12%. We analyze the device
operation in both the linear and non-linear microwave power response regimes
and compare the results to theoretical predictions, finding good agreement.

<h3>Kibble-Zurek mechanism of Ising domains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15821" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15821</a>

<br>
<br>
The formation of topological defects after a symmetry-breaking phase
transition is an overarching phenomenon that encodes rich information about the
underlying dynamics. Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), which describes these
nonequilibrium dynamics, predicts defect densities of these second-order phase
transitions driven by thermal fluctuations. It has been verified as a
successful model in a wide variety of physical systems, finding applications
from structure formation in the early universe to condensed matter systems.
However, whether topologically-trivial Ising domains, one of the most common
and fundamental types of domains in condensed matter systems, also obey the KZM
has never been investigated in the laboratory. We examined two different kinds
of three-dimensional (3D) structural Ising domains: clockwise
(CW)/counter-clockwise (CCW) ferro-rotation domains in NiTiO3 and up/down polar
domains in BiTeI. While the KZM slope of ferro-rotation domains in NiTiO3
agrees well with the prediction of the 3D Ising model, the KZM slope of polar
domains in BiTeI surprisingly far exceeds the theoretical limit, setting an
exotic example where possible weak long-range dipolar interactions play a
critical role in steepening the KZM slope of non-topological quantities. Our
results demonstrate the validity of KZM for Ising domains and reveal an
enhancement of the power-law exponent and a possible reduction of the dynamic
critical exponent z for transitions with long-range interactions.

<h3>A novel symmetry in nanocarbons: pre-constant discrete principal  curvature structure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Since the first-principles calculations in quantum chemistry precisely
provide possible configurations of carbon atoms in nanocarbons, we have
analyzed the geometrical structure of the possible carbon configurations and
found that there exists a novel symmetry in the nanocarbons, i.e., the
pre-constant discrete principal curvature (pCDPC) structure. In terms of the
discrete principal curvature based on the discrete geometry for trivalent
oriented graphs developed by Kotani, Naito, and Omori (Comput. Aided Geom.
Design, $\bf{58}$, (2017), 24-54), we numerically investigated discrete
principal curvature distribution of the nanocarbons, C$_{60}$, carbon
nanotubes, C$_{120}$ (C$_{60}$ dimer), and C$_{60}$-polymers (peanut-shaped
fullerene polymers). While the C$_{60}$ and nanotubes have the constant
discrete principal curvature (CDPC) as we expected, it is interesting to note
that the C$_{60}$-polymers and C$_{60}$ dimer also have the almost constant
discrete principal curvature, i.e., pCDPC, which is surprising. A nontrivial
pCDPC structure with revolutionary symmetry is available due to discreteness,
though it has been overlooked in geometry. In discrete geometry, there appears
a center axisoid which is the discrete analogue of the center axis in the
continuum differential geometry but has three-dimensional structure rather than
a one-dimensional curve due to its discrete nature. We demonstrated that such
pCDPC structure exists in nature, namely in the C$_{60}$-polymers. Furthermore,
since we found that there is a positive correlation between the degree of the
CDPC structure and stability of the configurations for certain class of the
C$_{60}$-polymers, we also revealed the origin of the pCDPC structure from an
aspect of materials science.

<br>
Sterically encumbering m-terphenyl isocyanides are a class of metal-binding
group that foster low-coordinate metal-center environments in coordination
chemistry by exerting considerable intermolecular steric pressures between
neighboring ligands. In the context of metal surfaces, the encumbering steric
properties of the m-terphenyl isocyanides are shown to weaken the interaction
between the metal-binding group and a planar substrate, leading to a preference
for molecular adsorption at sites with convex curvature, such as the step edges
and herringbone elbow sites on Au(111). Here, we investigate the site-selective
binding of individual m-terphenyl isocyanide ligands on a Au(111) surface
through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and inelastic electron tunneling
spectroscopy (IETS). The site-dependent steric pressure alters the vibrational
fingerprint of the m-terphenyl isocyanides, which is characterized with
single-molecule precision through joint experimental and theoretical
approaches. This study for the first time provides molecular-level insights
into the steric-pressure-enabled surface binding selectivity as well as its
effect on the chemical properties of individual m-terphenyl isocyanide ligands,
thereby highlighting the potential to control the physical and chemical
properties of metal surfaces through tailored ligand design.

We studied the interlayer coupling and decoupling of bilayer graphene (BLG)
by using spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with a
monochromated electron source. We correlated the twist-angle-dependent energy
band hybridization with Moire superlattices and the corresponding optical
absorption peaks. The optical absorption peak originates from the excitonic
transition between the hybridized van Hove singularities (vHSs), which shifts
systematically with the twist angle. We then proved that the BLG decouples when
a monolayer of metal chloride is intercalated in its van der Waals (vdW) gap,
and results in the elimination of the vHS peak.

Magnetic multiple-$Q$ states consisting of multiple spin density waves are a
source of unconventional topological spin textures, such as skyrmion and
hedgehog. We theoretically investigate a topologically nontrivial double-$Q$
state with a net spin scalar chirality on a two-dimensional square lattice. We
find that a double-$Q$ spiral superposition of the ordering wave vectors
located at the Brillouin zone boundary gives rise to unconventional noncoplanar
spin textures distinct from the skyrmion crystal. We show that such a
double-$Q$ state is stabilized by the interplay among the easy-axis anisotropic
interaction, high-harmonic wave-vector interaction, and external magnetic
field. Furthermore, the obtained double-$Q$ state becomes a Chern insulating
state with a quantum Hall conductivity when the Fermi level is located in the
band gaps. Our present results provide another platform to realize topological
magnetic states other than skyrmion crystals by focusing on the symmetry of
constituent ordering wave vectors in momentum space.

Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) is a powerful technique for
estimating element-specific magnetic moments of materials on nanoscale with the
potential to reach atomic resolution in transmission electron microscopes.
However, the fundamentally weak EMCD signal strength complicates quantification
of magnetic moments, as this requires very high precision, especially in the
denominator of the sum rules. Here, we employ a statistical resampling
technique known as bootstrapping to an experimental EMCD dataset to produce an
empirical estimate of the noise dependent error distribution resulting from
application of EMCD sum rules to bcc iron in a 3 beam orientation. We observe
clear experimental evidence that noisy EMCD signals preferentially bias the
estimation of magnetic moments, further supporting this with error
distributions produced by Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, we propose
guidelines for the recognition and minimization of this bias in the estimation
of magnetic moments.

<h3>Effect of anisotropic spin-orbit coupling on condensation and  superfluidity of a two dimensional Fermi gases</h3>

We investigated the ground state properties of a two dimensional Fermi
superfluid with an anisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) using path-integral
field theoretical method. Within the framework of mean-field theory, we
obtained the condensed fraction including contributions from both singlet and
triple pairing fields. We found that for small interaction parameters and large
anisotropic parameters, the total condensed fraction changes non-monotonically
when increasing the strength of SOC and has a global maximum. But this feature
disappears with decreasing the anisotropic parameter and increasing the
interaction parameter. However, condensed fraction always decrease with
increasing the anisotropic parameters. Because of the anisotropy of the SOC,
the superfluid fraction becomes a tensor. We obtained the superfluid fraction
tensor by deriving the effective action of the phase field of the order
parameter. Our numerical results show that for small interaction parameters and
large anisotropic parameters, superfluid fraction of the $x$ component
$\rho_{x}$ has a minimum as a function of the SOC strength. And this minimum of
$\rho_{x}$ disappears when decreasing the anisotropic parameters. In the strong
interaction regime, $\rho_{x}$ always decreases with increasing the strength of
SOC. While for the $y$ component of the superfluid fraction $\rho_{y}$, no
matter how large the interaction parameters and anisotropic parameters are, it
always has a minimum as a function of the SOC strength. As a function of the
anisotropic parameter, for strong SOC strength, $\rho_{x}<\rho_{y}$ with
$\rho_{x}$ having a minimum. For small SOC parameters $\rho_{x}>\rho_{y}$ with
$\rho_{y}$ developing a minimum only in the weak interaction limit.

<h3>Preliminary Tc calculations for iron-based superconductivity in NaFeAs,  LiFeAs, FeSe and nanostructured FeSe/SrTiO3 Superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Many theoretical models of iron-based superconductors have been proposed but
Tc calculations based on the models are usually missing. We have chosen two
models of iron-based superconductors in the literature and then compute the Tc
values accordingly: Recently two models have been announced which suggest that
superconducting electron concentration involved in the pairing mechanism of
iron-based superconductors may have been underestimated, and that the
antiferromagnetism and the induced xy potential may even have a dramatic
amplification effect on electron-phonon coupling. We use bulk FeSe, LiFeAs and
NaFeAs data to calculate the Tc based on these models and test if the combined
model can predict the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of the
nanostructured FeSe monolayer well. To substantiate the recently announced xy
potential in the literature, we create a two-channel model to separately
superimpose the dynamics of the electron in the upper and lower tetrahedral
plane. The results of our two-channel model support the literature data. Our
computational model takes into account this amplifying effect of
antiferromagnetism and the correction of the electron-phonon scattering matrix
together with the abnormal soft out-of-plane lattice vibration of the layered
structure, which allows us to calculate theoretical Tc values of LiFeAs, NaFeAs
and FeSe as a function of pressure that correspond reasonably well to the
experimental values. More importantly, by taking into account the interfacial
effect between an FeSe monolayer and its SrTiO3 substrate as an additional gain
factor, our calculated Tc value is up to 91 K high, and provides evidence that
the strong Tc enhancement recently observed in such monolayers with Tc reaching
100 K may be contributed from the electrons within the ARPES range.

Motivated by the experimental realization of single-component degenerate
Fermi gases of polar ground state KRb molecules with intrinsic two-body losses
[L. De Marco, G. Valtolina, K. Matsuda, W. G. Tobias, J. P. Covey, and J. Ye, A
degenerate Fermi gas of polar molecules, Science 363, 853 (2019)], this work
studies the finite-temperature loss rate of single-component Fermi gases with
weak interactions. First, we establish a relationship between the two-body loss
rate and the $p$-wave contact. Second, we evaluate the contact of the
homogeneous system in the low-temperature regime using $p$-wave Fermi liquid
theory and in the high-temperature regime using the second-order virial
expansion. Third, conjecturing that there are no phase transitions between the
two temperature regimes, we smoothly interpolate the results to intermediate
temperatures. It is found that the contact is constant at temperatures close to
zero and increases first quadratically with increasing temperature and finally
-- in agreement with the Bethe-Wigner threshold law -- linearly at high
temperatures. Fourth, applying the local-density approximation, we obtain the
loss-rate coefficient for the harmonically trapped system, reproducing the
experimental KRb loss measurements within a unified theoretical framework over
a wide temperature regime without fitting parameters. Our results for the
contact are not only applicable to molecular $p$-wave gases but also to atomic
single-component Fermi gases, such as 40K and 6Li.

We propose an experimentally feasible dissipative spin-wave diode comprising
two magnetic layers coupled via a non-magnetic spacer. We theoretically
demonstrate that the spacer mediates not only coherent interactions but also
dissipative coupling. Interestingly, an appropriately engineered dissipation
engenders a nonreciprocal device response, facilitating the realization of a
spin-wave diode. This diode permits wave propagation in one direction alone,
given that the coherent Dzyaloshinskii- Moriya (DM) interaction is balanced
with the dissipative coupling. The polarity of the diode is determined by the
sign of the DM interaction. Furthermore, we show that when the magnetic layers
undergo incoherent pumping, the device operates as a unidirectional spin-wave
amplifier. The amplifier gain is augmented by cascading multiple magnetic
bilayers. By extending our model to a one-dimensional ring structure, we
establish a connection between the physics of spin-wave amplification and
non-Hermitian topology. Our proposal opens up a new avenue for harnessing
inherent dissipation in spintronic applications.

<h3>Extremal statistics for a resetting Brownian motion before its  first-passage time</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the extreme value statistics of a one-dimensional resetting Brownian
motion (RBM) till its first passage through the origin starting from the
position $x_0$ ($>0$). By deriving the exit probability of RBM in an interval
$\left[0, M \right] $ from the origin, we obtain the distribution $P_r(M|x_0)$
of the maximum displacement $M$ and thus gives the expected value $\langle M
\rangle$ of $M$ as functions of the resetting rate $r$ and $x_0$. We find that
$\langle M \rangle$ decreases monotonically as $r$ increases, and tends to $2
x_0$ as $r \to \infty$. In the opposite limit, $\langle M \rangle$ diverges
logarithmically as $r \to 0$. Moreover, we derive the propagator of RBM in the
Laplace domain in the presence of both absorbing ends, and then leads to the
joint distribution $P_r(M,t_m|x_0)$ of $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which this
maximum is achieved in the Lapalce domain by using a path decomposition
technique, from which the expected value $\langle t_m \rangle$ of $t_m$ is
obtained explicitly. Interestingly, $\langle t_m \rangle$ shows a nonmonotonic
dependence on $r$, and attains its minimum at an optimal $r^{*} \approx 2.71691
D/x_0^2$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Finally, we perform extensive
simulations to validate our theoretical results.

<h3>Atomistic modeling of extreme near-field heat transport across nanogaps  between two polar dielectric materials</h3>

The understanding of extreme near-field heat transport across vacuum nanogaps
between polar dielectric materials remains an open question. In this work, we
present a molecular dynamic simulation of heat transport across MgO-MgO
nanogaps, together with a consistent comparison with the continuum
fluctuational-electrodynamics theory using local dielectric properties. The
dielectric function is computed by Green-Kubo molecular dynamics with the
anharmonic damping properly included. As a result, the direct atomistic
modeling shows significant deviation from the continuum theory even up to a gap
size of few nanometers due to non-local dielectric response from acoustic and
optical branches as well as phonon tunneling. The lattice anharmonicity is
demonstrated to have a large impact on the energy transmission and thermal
conductance, in contrast to its moderate effect reported for metallic vacuum
nanogaps. The present work thus provides further insight into the physics of
heat transport in the extreme near-field regime between polar materials, and
put forward a methodology to account for anharmonic effects.

<h3>Effects of deposition temperature on the mechanical and structural  properties of amorphous Al-Si-O thin films prepared by RF magnetron  sputtering</h3>

Aluminosilicate (Al-Si-O) thin films containing up to 31 at. % Al and 23 at.
% Si were prepared by reactive RF magnetron co-sputtering. Mechanical and
structural properties were measured by indentation and specular reflectance
infrared spectroscopy at varying Si sputtering target power and substrate
temperature in the range 100 to 500 {\deg}C. It was found that an increased
substrate temperature and Al/Si ratio give denser structure and consequently
higher hardness (7.4 to 9.5 GPa) and reduced elastic modulus (85 to 93 GPa)
while at the same time lower crack resistance (2.6 to 0.9 N). The intensity of
the infrared Si-O-Si/Al asymmetric stretching vibrations shows a linear
dependence with respect to Al concentration. The Al-O-Al vibrational band (at
1050 cm-1) shifts towards higher wavenumbers with increasing Al concentration
which indicates a decrease of the bond length, evidencing denser structure and
higher residual stress, which is supported by the increased hardness. The same
Al-O-Al vibrational band (at 1050 cm-1) shifts towards lower wavenumber with
increasing substrate temperature indicating an increase in the of the average
coordination number of Al.

The collective tunneling of a a Wigner necklace - a crystalline state of a
small number of strongly interacting electrons confined to a suspended nanotube
and subject to a double well potential - is theoretically analyzed and compared
with experiments in [Shapir $\textit{et al.}$, Science $\textbf {364}$, 870
(2019)]. Density Matrix Renormalization Group computations, exact
diagonalization, and instanton theory provide a consistent description of this
very strongly interacting system, and show good agreement with experiments.
Experimentally extracted and theoretically computed tunneling amplitudes
exhibit a scaling collapse. Collective quantum fluctuations renormalize the
tunneling, and substantially enhance it as the number of electrons increases.

$\mathrm{Fe_{n=4,5}GeTe_2}$ exhibits quasi-two-dimensional properties as a
promising candidate for a near-room-temperature ferromagnet, which has
attracted great interest. In this work, we notice that the crystal lattice of
$\mathrm{Fe_{n=4,5}GeTe_2}$ can be approximately considered to be stacked by
three bipartite crystal lattices. By combining the model Hamiltonians of
bipartite crystal lattices and first-principles calculations, we investigate
the electronic structure and the magnetism of $\mathrm{Fe_{n=4,5}GeTe_2}$. We
conclude that flat bands near the Fermi level originate from the bipartite
crystal lattices and that these flat bands are expected to lead to the
itinerant ferromagnetism in $\mathrm{Fe_{n=4,5}GeTe_2}$. Interestingly, we also
find that the magnetic moment of the Fe5 atom in $\mathrm{Fe_5 Ge Te_2}$ is
distinct from the other Fe atoms and is sensitive with the Coulomb interaction
$U$ and external pressure. These findings may be helpful to understand the
exotic magnetic behavior of $\mathrm{Fe_{n=4,5} Ge Te_2}$.

Processes involving ultrafast laser driven electron-phonon dynamics play a
fundamental role in the response of quantum systems in a growing number of
situations of interest, as evidenced by phenomena such as strongly driven phase
transitions and light driven engineering of material properties. To show how
these processes can be captured from a computational perspective, we simulate
the transient absorption spectra and high harmonic generation signals
associated with valley selective excitation and intra-band charge carrier
relaxation in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride. We show that the
multi-trajectory Ehrenfest dynamics approach, implemented in combination with
real-time time-dependent density functional theory and tight-binding models,
offers a simple, accurate and efficient method to study ultrafast
electron-phonon coupled phenomena in solids under diverse pump-probe regimes
which can be easily incorporated into the majority of real-time ab-initio
software packages.

Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are predicted to exhibit
exceptional edge-related properties, such as localized edge states, spin
polarization, and half-metallicity. However, the absence of low-resistance
nano-scale electrical contacts to the GNRs hinders harnessing their properties
in field-effect transistors. In this paper, we make electrical contact with
9-atom-wide armchair GNRs using superconducting alloy MoRe as well as Pd (as a
reference), which are two of the metals providing low-resistance contacts to
carbon nanotubes. We take a step towards contacting a single GNR by fabrication
of electrodes with a needle-like geometry, with about 20 nm tip diameter and 10
nm separation. To preserve the nano-scale geometry of the contacts, we develop
a PMMA-assisted technique to transfer the GNRs onto the pre-patterned
electrodes. Our device characterizations as a function of bias-voltage and
temperature, show a thermally-activated gate-tunable conductance in the
GNR-MoRe-based transistors.

Single cobalt atoms on the (111) surfaces of noble metals were for a long
time considered prototypical systems for the Kondo effect in scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments. Yet, recent first-principle calculations suggest that
the experimentally observed spectroscopic zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) should be
interpreted in terms of excitations of the Co atom's spin and the formation of
a novel quasiparticle, the spinaron, a magnetic polaron resulting from the
interaction of spin excitations with conduction electrons, rather than in terms
of a Kondo resonance. Here we present state-of-the-art spin-averaged and
spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on Co atoms on the
Cu(111) surface in magnetic fields of up to 12 T, that allow us to discriminate
between the different theoretical models and to invalidate the prevailing
Kondo-based interpretation of the ZBA. Employing extended ab-initio
calculations, we instead provide strong evidence for multiple spinaronic states
in the system. Our work opens a new avenue of research to explore the
characteristics and consequences of these intriguing hybrid many-body states as
well as their design in man-made nanostructures.

We study experimentally the processes of parametric excitation in microscopic
magnetically saturated disks of nanometer-thick Yttrium Iron Garnet. We show
that, depending on the relative orientation between the parametric pumping
field and the static magnetization, excitation of either degenerate or
non-degenerate magnon pairs is possible. In the latter case, which is
particularly important for applications associated with the realization of
computation in the reciprocal space, a single-frequency pumping can generate
pairs of magnons whose frequencies correspond to different eigenmodes of the
disk. We show that, depending on the size of the disk and the modes involved,
the frequency difference in a pair can vary in the range 0.1-0.8 GHz. We
demonstrate that in this system, one can easily realize a practically important
situation where several magnon pairs share the same mode. We also observe the
simultaneous generation of up to six different modes using a fixed-frequency
monochromatic pumping. Our experimental findings are supported by numerical
calculations that allow us to unambiguously identify the excited modes. Our
results open new possibilities for the implementation of reciprocal-space
computing making use of low damping magnetic insulators.

In recent years statistical physics has proven to be a valuable tool to probe
into large dimensional inference problems such as the ones occurring in machine
learning. Statistical physics provides analytical tools to study fundamental
limitations in their solutions and proposes algorithms to solve individual
instances. In these notes, based on the lectures by Marc M\'ezard in 2022 at
the summer school in Les Houches, we will present a general framework that can
be used in a large variety of problems with weak long-range interactions,
including the compressed sensing problem, or the problem of learning in a
perceptron. We shall see how these problems can be studied at the replica
symmetric level, using developments of the cavity methods, both as a
theoretical tool and as an algorithm.

The role of disorder on physical systems has been widely studied in the
macroscopic and microscopic world. While static disorder is well understood in
many cases, the impact of time-dependent disorder on quantum gases is still
poorly investigated. In our experimental setup, we produce and characterize
time-dependent optical-speckle disorder for ultracold quantum gases with
tunable correlation time. Experimentally, coherent light illuminates a
combination of a static and a rotating diffuser, thereby collecting a spatially
varying phase due to the diffusers' structure and a temporally variable phase
due to the relative rotation. The rotation speed of the diffuser determines a
characteristic time scale of the dynamics. It can be tuned within a broad range
matching typical time scales of the quantum gases investigated. We characterize
the dynamic speckle pattern ex-situ by measuring its intensity distribution and
in-situ by observing its impact on a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. As one
diffuser rotates relative to the other around the common optical axis, we trace
the optical speckle's intensity correlations and the quantum gas'
density-density correlations. Our results show comparable outcomes for both
measurement methods. The setup allows us to tune the disorder potential adapted
to the characteristics of the quantum gas. These studies pave the way for
investigating nonequilibrium physics in interacting quantum gases using
controlled dynamical-disorder potentials.

In this work, a generalized force-field methodology for the relaxation of
large moir\'e heterostructures is proposed. The force-field parameters are
optimized to accurately reproduce the structural degrees of freedom of some
computationally manageable cells relaxed using density functional theory. The
parameters can then be used to handle large moir\'e systems. We specialize to
the case of 2H-phased twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homo- and
heterobilayers using a combination of the Stillinger-Weber intralayer- and the
Kolmogorov-Crespi interlayer-potential. Force-field parameters are developed
for all combinations of MX$_2$ for $\text{M}\in\{\text{Mo},\text{W}\}$ and
$\text{X}\in\{\text{S},\text{Se},\text{Te}\}$. The results show agreement
within 20 meV in terms of band structure between density functional theory and
force-field relaxation. Using the relaxed structures, a simplified and
systematic scheme for the extraction of the interlayer moir\'e potential is
presented for both R- and H-stacked systems. We show that in-plane and
out-of-plane relaxation effects on the moir\'e potential, which is made both
deeper and wider after relaxation, are essential. An interpolation based
methodology for the calculation of the interlayer binding energy is also
proposed. Finally, we show that atomic reconstruction, which is captured by the
force-field method, becomes especially prominent for angles below 4-5$^\circ$,
when there is no mismatch in lattice constant between layers.

Driven many-body systems typically experience heating due to the lack of
energy conservation. Heating may be suppressed for time-periodic drives, but
little is known for less regular drive protocols. In this work, we investigate
the heating dynamics in aperiodically kicked systems, specifically those driven
by quasi-periodic Thue-Morse or a family of random sequences with
$n$-multipolar temporal correlations. We demonstrate that multiple heating
channels can be eliminated even away from the high-frequency regime. The number
of eliminated channels increases with multipolar order $n$. We illustrate this
in a classical kicked rotor chain where we find a long-lived prethermal regime.
When the static Hamiltonian only involves the kinetic energy, the prethermal
lifetime $t^*$ can strongly depend on the temporal correlations of the drive,
with a power-law dependence on the kick strength $t^*\sim K^{-2n}$, for which
we can account using a simple linearization argument.

When an open tube of small diameter touches a bubble of a larger diameter,
the bubble spontaneously shrinks and pushes a soap film in the tube. We
characterize the dynamics for different bubble sizes and number of soap films
in the tube. We rationalize this observation from a mechanical force balance
involving the Laplace pressure of the bubble and the viscous force from the
advancing soap lamellae in the tube. We propose a numerical resolution of this
model, and an analytical solution in an asymptotic regime. These predictions
are then compared to the experiments. The emptying duration is primarily
affected by the initial bubble to tube diameter ratio and by the number of soap
films in the tube.

Strongly-interacting nanomagnetic arrays are ideal systems for exploring the
frontiers of magnonic control. They provide functional reconfigurable platforms
and attractive technological solutions across storage, GHz communications and
neuromorphic computing. Typically, these systems are primarily constrained by
their range of accessible states and the strength of magnon coupling phenomena.
Increasingly, magnetic nanostructures have explored the benefits of expanding
into three dimensions. This has broadened the horizons of magnetic microstate
spaces and functional behaviours, but precise control of 3D states and dynamics
remains challenging.
Here, we introduce a 3D magnonic metamaterial, compatible with
widely-available fabrication and characterisation techniques. By combining
independently-programmable artificial spin-systems strongly coupled in the
z-plane, we construct a reconfigurable 3D metamaterial with an exceptionally
high 16N microstate space and intense static and dynamic magnetic coupling. The
system exhibits a broad range of emergent phenomena including ultrastrong
magnon-magnon coupling with normalised coupling rates of $\frac{\Delta
\omega}{\gamma} = 0.57$ and magnon-magnon cooperativity up to C = 126.4, GHz
mode shifts in zero applied field and chirality-selective magneto-toroidal

We report on the delamination of thin ($\approx \mu$m) hydrogel films grafted
to silicon substrates under the action of swelling stresses.
Poly(dimetylacrylamide) (PDMA) films are synthesized by simultaneously
cross-linking and grafting preformed polymer chains onto the silicon substrate
using a thiol-ene reaction. The grafting density at the film/substrate
interface is tuned by varying the surface density of reactive thiol-silane
groups on the silicon substrate. Delamination of the films from well controlled
line defects with low adhesion is monitored under a humid water vapor flow
ensuring full saturation of the polymer network. A propagating delamination of
the film is observed under the action of differential swelling stresses at the
debonding front. A threshold thickness for the onset of this delamination is
evidenced which is increasing with grafting density while the debonding
velocity is also observed to decrease with an increase in grafting density.
These observations are discussed within the framework of a nonlinear fracture
mechanics model which assumes that the driving force for crack propagation is
the difference between the swelling state of the bonded and delaminated parts
of the film. Using this model, the threshold energy for crack initiation was
determined from the measured threshold thickness and discussed in relation to
the surface density of reactive thiol groups on the substrate.

Motivated by the search for chiral spin liquids (CSL), we consider a simple
model defined on the kagome lattice of interacting SU(3) spins (in the
fundamental representation) including two-site and three-site permutations
between nearest neighbor sites and on triangles, respectively. By combining
analytical developments and various numerical techniques, namely exact Lanczos
diagonalizations and tensor network variational approaches, we find a rich
phase diagram with non-topological (``trivial") and topological (possibly
chiral) gapped spin liquids (SLs). Trivial spin liquids include an
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT)-like phase and a trimerized phase, the
latter breaking the inversion center between the up and down triangles of the
kagome lattice. A topological SL is stabilized in a restricted part of the
phase diagram by the time-reversal symmetry breaking (complex) 3-site
permutation term. Analyzing the chiral edge modes of this topological SL on
long cylinders or on finite disks, we have come up with two competing
scenarios, either a CSL or a double Chern-Simon SL characterized by a single or
by two counter-propagating Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(3)$_1$ chiral mode(s),
respectively. In the vicinity of the extended ferromagnetic region we have
found a magnetic phase corresponding either to a modulated canted ferromagnet

We present a theoretical study of a system consisting of a superconducting
island and two quantum dots, a possible platform for building qubits and Cooper
pair splitters, in the regime where each dot hosts a single electron and,
hence, carries a magnetic moment. We focus on the case where the dots are
coupled to overlapping superconductor states and we study whether the spins are
ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically aligned. We show that if the total
number of particles is even, the spins align antiferromagnetically in the
flatband limit, i.e., when the bandwidth of the superconductor is negligibly
small, but ferromagnetically if the bandwidth is finite and above some value.
If the total number of particles is odd, the alignment is ferromagnetic
independently from the bandwidth. This implies that the results of the flatband
limit are applicable only within restricted parameter regime for realistic
superconducting qubit systems and that some care is required in applying
simplified models to devices such as Cooper pair splitters.

Hybrid Josephson junctions realized on a two-dimensional electron gas are
considered promising candidates for developing topological elements that are

of the detection of topological superconductivity via the non-local
spectroscopy technique. We show that the non-local conductance is related to
the system band structure, allowing probe of the gap closing and reopening
related to the topological transition. We demonstrate that the topological
transition induces a change in the sign of the non-local conductance at zero
energy due to the change in the quasiparticle character of the dispersion at
zero momentum. Importantly, we find that the tunability of the superconducting
phase difference via flux in hybrid Josephson junctions systems is strongly
influenced by the strength of the Zeeman interaction, which leads to
considerable modifications in the complete phase diagram that can be measured
under realistic experimental conditions.

<h3>Local Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Formalism for Dissipative Fermionic  Systems and Loss-Induced Population Increase in Fermi Superfluids</h3>

Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) is an effective formalism for open quantum
systems. In common wisdom, when the system is described by the Lindblad master
equation, the NHH obtained by neglecting its jump term is believed to be a good
approximation for a timescale sufficiently shorter than the inverse of the
dissipation rate. We challenge this common wisdom and develop a scheme to
obtain an appropriate NHH from the original master equation for dissipative
fermionic systems. This NHH, called the local NHH, describes the loss process
in each individual mode locally. As a concrete example, we justify our new
scheme using fermionic superfluid under one-body loss. Furthermore, we find
loss-induced population increase in the long time evolution due to the
dissipation-induced phase locking between the pairing gap and the anomalous
field.

<h3>Estimating melting curves for Cu and Al from simulations at a single  state point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16238</a>

Determining the melting curves of materials up to high pressures has long
been a challenge experimentally and theoretically. A large class of materials,
including most metals, has been shown to exhibit hidden scale invariance, an
approximate scale invariance of the potential-energy landscape that is not
obvious from the Hamiltonian. For these materials the isomorph theory allows
the identification of curves in the phase diagram along which structural and
dynamical properties are invariant to a good approximation when expressed in
appropriately scaled form. These curves, the isomorphs, can also be used as the
basis for constructing accurate melting curves from simulations at a single
state point [U. R. Pedersen \textit{et al.}, Nat. Comm. \textbf{7}, 12386
(2016)]. In this work we apply the method to the metals Cu simulated using the
effective medium theory and Al simulated using density functional theory (DFT).
For Cu the method works very well and is validated using two-phase melting
point simulations. For Al there are likewise good isomorphs and the method
generates the melting curve accurately as compared to previous experimental and
DFT results. In line with a recent suggestion of Hong and van de Walle [Phys.
Rev. B \textbf{100}, 140102 (2019)], we finally argue that the tendency for the
density-scaling exponent $\gamma$ to decrease with increasing density in metals
implies that metals in general will undergo re-entrant melting, i.e., have a
maximum of melting temperature as a function of pressure.

<h3>The dynamical structure factor of the SU(4) algebraic spin liquid on the  honeycomb lattice</h3>

We compute the momentum resolved dynamical spin structure factor
$S(k,\omega)$ of the SU(4) Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice assuming
the $\pi$-flux Dirac spin liquid ground state by two methods: (i) variationally
using Gutzwiller projected particle-hole excitations of the $\pi$-flux Fermi
sea and (ii) in the non-interacting parton mean-field picture. The two
approaches produce qualitatively similar results. Based on this analogy, we
argue that the energy spectrum of the projected excitations is a gapless
continuum of fractional excitations. Quantitatively, the Gutzwiller projection
shifts the weight from higher to lower energies, thus emphasizing the lower
edge of the continuum. In the mean-field approach, we obtained the
$1/\text{distance}^4$ decay of the spin correlation function, and the local
correlations show $S^{33}_{\text{MF}}(\omega)\propto \omega^3$ behavior.

Superconductivity allows electrical current to flow without any energy loss,
and thus making solids superconducting is a grand goal of physics, material
science, and electrical engineering. More than 16 Nobel Laureates have been
awarded for their contribution to superconductivity research. Superconductors
are valuable for sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as climate change
mitigation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and
infrastructure, and so on. However, a unified physics theory explaining all
superconductivity mechanism is still unknown. It is believed that
superconductivity is microscopically due to not only molecular compositions but
also the geometric crystal structure. Hence a new dataset, S2S, containing both
crystal structures and superconducting critical temperature, is built upon
SuperCon and Material Project. Based on this new dataset, we propose a novel
model, S2SNet, which utilizes the attention mechanism for superconductivity
prediction. To overcome the shortage of data, S2SNet is pre-trained on the
whole Material Project dataset with Masked-Language Modeling (MLM). S2SNet
makes a new state-of-the-art, with out-of-sample accuracy of 92% and Area Under
Curve (AUC) of 0.92. To the best of our knowledge, S2SNet is the first work to
predict superconductivity with only information of crystal structures. This
work is beneficial to superconductivity discovery and further SDGs. Code and

<h3>c axis electrical transport at the metamagnetic transition in the  heavy-fermion superconductor UTe2 under pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
The electrical resistivity of the unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$ shows
very anisotropic behavior in the normal state depending on the current
direction. In the present paper we show that the maximum in the resistivity
$\rho_c$ for current applied along the $c$ axis at $T^{\rm max}_{\rho_c}
\approx 14.75$~K follows the minimum in the thermal expansion $T_\alpha^\star$
along $b$ axis. Under a magnetic field applied along the $b$ axis, $T^{\rm
max}_{\rho_c}$ can be tracked up to the critical point of the first order
metamagnetic transition, which is located near 6~K and 34.5~T. Surprisingly, at
the metamagnetic field $H_m$ the resistivity $\rho_c$ shows a steplike decrease
while the resistivities $\rho_a$ and $\rho_b$, for current along the $a$ and
$b$ axis, respectively, show a steplike increase. Under hydrostatic pressure
$T^{\rm max}_{\rho_c}$ and $H_m$ decrease significantly up to the critical
pressure $p_c$ at which superconductivity is suppressed and a long range
antiferromagnetic order appears. We show that the phase diagram at different
pressures can be scaled by $T^{\rm max}_{\rho_c}$ in field and temperature
suggesting that this temperature scale is governing the main interactions in
the normal state.

<h3>Emergent criticality in fully frustrated quantum magnets</h3>

Phase transitions in condensed matter are often linked to exotic emergent
properties. We study the fully frustrated bilayer Heisenberg antiferromagnet to
demonstrate that an applied magnetic field creates a novel emergent
criticality. The quantum phase diagram contains four states, the DS (singlets
on every interlayer dimer bond), DTAF (all triplets with antiferromagnetic
order), TC (a singlet-triplet checkerboard) and FM (saturated ferromagnet). The
thermal phase diagram is dominated by a wall of discontinuities extending from
the zero-field DTAF-DS transition to a quantum critical endpoint where the
field drives the DTAF and TC into the FM. This first-order wall is terminated
at finite temperatures by a line of critical points, where the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition of the DTAF and the thermal
Ising transition of the TC also terminate. We demonstrate by quantum Monte
Carlo simulations that the BKT transition does not change the Ising nature of
the DTAF-DS critical line. By contrast, the combination of symmetries merging
on the multicritical DTAF-TC line leads to a 4-state Potts universality not
contained in the microscopic Hamiltonian, which we associate with the
Ashkin-Teller model. Our results represent a systematic step in understanding
emergent phenomena in quantum magnetic materials including the
``Shastry-Sutherland compound'' SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

<h3>Roadmap towards Majorana qubits and nonabelian physics in quantum  dot-based minimal Kitaev chains</h3>

<br>
<br>
The possibility to engineer artificial Kitaev chains in arrays of quantum
dots coupled via narrow superconducting regions has emerged as an attractive
way to overcome the disorder issues that complicate the realization and
detection of topological superconducting phases in other platforms. Although a
true topological phase would require long chains, already a two-site chain
realized in a double quantum dot can be tuned to points in parameter space
where it hosts zero-energy states that seem identical to the Majorana bound
states that characterize a topological phase. These states were named "poor
man's Majorana bound states" (PMMs) because they lack formal topological
protection. In this work, we propose a roadmap for next-generation experiments
on PMMs. The roadmap starts with experiments to characterize a single pair of
PMMs by measuring the Majorana quality, then moves on to initialization and
readout of the parity of a PMM pair, which allows measuring quasiparticle
poisoning times. The next step is to couple two PMM systems to form a qubit. We
discuss measurements of the coherence time of such a qubit, as well as a test
of Majorana fusion rules in the same setup. Finally, we propose and analyse
three different types of braiding-like experiments which require more complex
device geometries. Our conclusions are supported by calculations based on a
realistic model with interacting and spinful quantum dots, as well as by
simpler models to gain physical insight. Our calculations show that it is
indeed possible to demonstrate nonabelian physics in minimal two-site Kitaev
chains despite the lack of a true topological phase. But our findings also
reveal that doing so requires some extra care, appropriately modified protocols
and awareness of the details of this particular platform.

<h3>Phase-shifted Andreev levels in an altermagnet Josephson junction</h3>

<br>
<br>
We compute the effect of a d-wave magnetization (altermagnetism) on the
spectrum of bound states (Andreev levels) in a junction between two s-wave
superconductors (gap $\Delta_0$, phase difference $\phi$). Compared to a
nonmagnetic junction, the $\phi$-dependence of the spectrum is shifted by an
offset $\pm\delta\phi$, dependent on the spin direction, so that the Andreev
levels become spin-polarized. In a planar junction, oriented along the
crystalline axis of $d_{xy}$-wave symmetry, the excitation energies are
determined by the normal-state transmission probability $T$ according to
$E=\Delta_0\sqrt{1-T\sin^2\tfrac{1}{2}(\phi\pm\delta\phi)}$. We calculate the
corresponding Josephson energy and supercurrent, recovering the 0-$\pi$
transition of related studies.

<h3>Suppression of the spin waves nonreciprocity due to interfacial  Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction by lateral confinement in magnetic  nanostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite the huge recent interest towards chiral magnetism related to the
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (iDMI) in layered systems, there
is a lack of experimental data on the effect of iDMI on the spin waves
eigenmodes of laterally confined nanostructures. Here we exploit Brillouin
Light Scattering (BLS) to analyze the spin wave eigenmodes of non-interacting
circular and elliptical dots, as well as of long stripes, patterned starting
from a Pt(3.4 nm)/CoFeB(0.8 nm) bilayer, with lateral dimensions ranging from
100 nm to 400 nm. Our experimental results, corroborated by micromagnetic
simulations based on the GPU-accelerated MuMax3 software package, provide
evidence for a strong suppression of the frequency asymmetry between
counter-propagating spin waves (corresponding to either Stokes or anti-Stokes
peaks in BLS spectra), when the lateral confinement is reduced from 400 nm to
100 nm, i.e. when it becomes lower than the light wavelength. Such an evolution
reflects the modification of the spin wave character from propagating to
stationary and indicates that the BLS based method of quantifying the i-DMI
strength from the frequency difference of counter propagating spin waves is not
applicable in the case of magnetic elements with lateral dimension below about
400 nm.

Spin textures, i.e., the distribution of spin polarization vectors in
reciprocal space, exhibit diverse patterns determined by symmetry constraints,
resulting in a variety of spintronic phenomena. Here, we propose a universal
theory to comprehensively describe the nature of spin textures by incorporating
three symmetry flavors of reciprocal wavevector, atomic orbital and atomic
site. Such approach enables us to establish a complete classification of spin
textures constrained by the little co-group and predict unprecedentedly
reported spin texture types, such as Zeeman-type spin splitting in
antiferromagnets and quadratic spin texture. To examine the impact of atomic
orbitals and sites, we predict orbital-dependent spin texture and anisotropic
spin-momentum-site locking effects and corresponding material candidates
validated through first-principles calculations. Our theory not only covers all
possible spin textures in crystal solids described by magnetic space groups,
but also introduces new possibilities for designing innovative spin textures by
the coupling of multiple degrees of freedom.

<h3>Statistics of Long-Range Force Fields in Random Environments: Beyond  Holtsmark</h3>

<br>
<br>
Since the times of Holtsmark (1911), statistics of fields in random
environments have been widely studied, for example in astrophysics, active
matter, and line-shape broadening. The power-law decay of the two-body
interaction, of the form $1/|r|^\delta$, and assuming spatial uniformity of the
medium particles exerting the forces, imply that the fields are fat-tailed
distributed, and in general are described by stable L\'evy distributions. With
this widely used framework, the variance of the field diverges, which is
non-physical, due to finite size cutoffs. We find a complementary statistical
law to the L\'evy-Holtsmark distribution describing the large fields in the
problem, which is related to the finite size of the tracer particle. We
discover bi-scaling, with a sharp statistical transition of the force moments
taking place when the order of the moment is $d/\delta$, where $d$ is the
dimension. The high-order moments, including the variance, are described by the
framework presented in this paper, which is expected to hold for many systems.
The new scaling solution found here is non-normalized similar to infinite
invariant densities found in dynamical systems.

<br>

An undisturbed Brownian oscillator may not reach thermal equilibrium with the
thermal bath due to the formation of a localized normal mode. The latter may
emerge when the spectrum of the thermal bath has a finite upper bound
$\omega_0$ and the oscillator natural frequency exceeds a critical value
$\omega_c$, which depends on the specific form of the bath spectrum. We
consider the response of the oscillator with and without a localized mode to
the external periodic force with frequency $\Omega$ lower than $\omega_0$. The
results complement those obtained earlier for the high-frequency response at
$\Omega\ge \omega_0$ and require a different mathematical approach. The
signature property of the high-frequency response is resonance when the
external force frequency $\Omega$ coincides with the frequency of the localized
mode $\omega_*$. In the low-frequency domain $\Omega<\omega_0$ the condition of
resonance $\Omega=\omega_*$ cannot be met (since $\omega_*>\omega_0$). Yet, in
the limits $\omega\to\omega_c$ and $\Omega\to\omega_0^-$, the oscillator shows
a peculiar quasi-resonance response with an amplitude increasing with time
sublinearly.

The recently discovered layered kagome superconductors
$\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs) have garnered
significant attention, as they exhibit an intriguing combination of
superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) order, and nontrivial band
topology. As such, these kagome systems serve as an exceptional quantum
platform for investigating the intricate interplay between electron correlation
effects, geometric frustration, and topological electronic structure. A
comprehensive understanding of the underlying electronic structure is crucial
for unveiling the nature and origin of the CDW order, as well as determining
the electron pairing symmetry in the kagome superconductors. In this review, we
present a concise survey of the electronic properties of
$\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, with a particular focus on the insights derived
from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Through the lens of
ARPES, we shed light on the electronic characteristics of the kagome
superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, which will pave the way for
exciting new research frontiers in kagome-related physics.

Accurate classification of molecular chemical motifs from experimental
measurement is an important problem in molecular physics, chemistry and
biology. In this work, we present neural network ensemble classifiers for
predicting the presence (or lack thereof) of 41 different chemical motifs on
small molecules from simulated C, N and O K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) spectra. Our classifiers not only reach a maximum average
class-balanced accuracy of 0.99 but also accurately quantify uncertainty. We
also show that including multiple XANES modalities improves predictions notably
on average, demonstrating a "multi-modal advantage" over any single modality.
In addition to structure refinement, our approach can be generalized for broad
applications with molecular design pipelines.

The connectivity within single carrier information-processing devices
requires transport and storage of single charge quanta. Our all-electrical
Si/SiGe shuttle device, called quantum bus (QuBus), spans a length of 10
$\mathrm{\mu}$m and is operated by only six simply-tunable voltage pulses. It
operates in conveyor-mode, i.e. the electron is adiabatically transported while
confined to a moving QD. We introduce a characterization method, called
shuttle-tomography, to benchmark the potential imperfections and local
shuttle-fidelity of the QuBus. The fidelity of the single-electron shuttle
across the full device and back (a total distance of 19 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) is
$(99.7 \pm 0.3)\,\%$. Using the QuBus, we position and detect up to 34
electrons and initialize a register of 34 quantum dots with arbitrarily chosen
patterns of zero and single-electrons. The simple operation signals,
compatibility with industry fabrication and low spin-environment-interaction in
$^{28}$Si/SiGe, promises spin-conserving transport of spin qubits for quantum
connectivity in quantum computing architectures.

<br>
<br>
The morphological evolution of nanoporous gold is generally believed to be
governed by surface diffusion. This work specifically explores the dependence
of mass transport by surface diffusion on the curvature of a gold surface. The
surface diffusivity is estimated by molecular dynamics simulations for a
variety of surfaces of constant mean curvature, eliminating any chemical
potential gradients and allowing the possible dependence of the surface
diffusivity on mean curvature to be isolated. The apparent surface diffusivity
is found to have an activation energy of ~0.74 eV with a weak dependence on
curvature, but is consistent with the values reported in the literature. The
apparent concentration of mobile surface atoms is found to be highly variable,
having an Arrhenius dependence on temperature with an activation energy that
also has a weak curvature dependence. These activation energies depend on
curvature in such a way that the rate of mass transport by surface diffusion is
nearly independent of curvature, but with a higher activation energy of ~1.01
eV. The curvature dependencies of the apparent surface diffusivity and
concentration of mobile surface atoms is believed to be related to the expected
lifetime of a mobile surface atom, and has the practical consequence that a
simulation study that does not account for this finite lifetime could
underestimate the activation energy for mass transport via surface diffusion by
~0.27 eV.

Understanding the speed limits for the propagation of magnons is of key
importance for the development of ultrafast spintronics and magnonics.
Recently, it was predicted that in 2D antiferromagnets, spin correlations can
propagate faster than the highest magnon velocity. Here we gain deeper
understanding of this supermagnonic effect based on time-dependent Schwinger
boson mean-field theory. We find that the supermagnonic effect is determined by
the competition between propagating magnons and a localized quasi-bound state,
which is tunable by lattice coordination and quantum spin value $S$, suggesting
a new scenario to enhance magnon propagation.

Re-configurable materials and meta-materials can jump between space symmetry
classes during their deformations. Here, we introduce the concept of singular
symmetry enhancement, which refers to an abrupt jump to a higher symmetry class
accompanied by an un-avoidable reduction in the number of dispersion bands of
the excitations of the material. Such phenomenon prompts closings of some of
the spectral resonant gaps along singular manifolds in a parameter space. In
this work, we demonstrate that these singular manifolds carry topological
charges. As a concrete example, we show that a deformation of an acoustic
crystal that encircles a $p11g$-symmetric configuration of the cavity
resonators results in an adiabatic cycle that carries a Chern number in the
bulk and displays Thouless pumping at the edges. The outcome is a very general
principle for recognizing or engineering topological adiabatic processes in
complex materials and meta-materials.
