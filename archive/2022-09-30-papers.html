<h3>Deforming Active Droplets in Viscoelastic Media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14348</a>
<br>
<i>Prateek Dwivedi, Atishay Shrivastava, Naveen Tiwari, Dipin Pillai, Rahul Mangal</i>
<br>
To mimic the motion of biological swimmers in bodily fluids, a novel
experimental system of micellar solubilization driven active droplets in a
visco-elastic polymeric solution is presented. The visco-elastic nature of the
medium, characterized by the Deborah number (De), is tuned by varying the
surfactant (fuel) and polymer concentration in the ambient medium. At moderate
De, the droplet exhibits a steady deformed shape, markedly different from the
spherical shape observed in Newtonian media. A theoretical analysis based on
the normal stress balance at the interface is shown to accurately predict the
droplet shape. With a further increase in De, time-periodic deformations
accompanied by oscillatory transitions in swimming modes are observed. The
study unveils the rich complexity in the motion of active droplets in
viscoelastic fluids, which has been hitherto unexplored.

<h3>Weak-Coupling Theory of Pair Density-Wave Instabilities in Transition  Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14469" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14469</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Shaffer, F. J. Burnell, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<br>
The possibility of realizing pair density wave (PDW) phases, in which Cooper
pairs have a finite momentum, presents an interesting challenge that has been
studied in a wide variety of systems. In conventional superconductors, this is
only possible when external fields lift the spin degeneracy of the Fermi
surface, leading to pair formation at an incommensurate momentum. Here, we
study a second possibility, potentially relevant to transition metal
dichalcogenides, in which the Fermi surface consists of a pair of pockets
centered at the $\pm K$ points of the Brillouin zone as well as a central
pocket at the $\Gamma$ point. In the limit where these three pockets are
identical, the pairing susceptibility has a logarithmic divergence at the
non-zero wave-vectors $\pm \mathbf{K}$, allowing for a weak-coupling analysis
of the PDW instability. We find that repulsive electronic interactions combine
to yield effective attractive interactions in the singlet and triplet PDW
channels, as long as the $\Gamma$ pocket is present. Because these PDW channels
decouple from the uniform superconducting channel, they can become the leading
unconventional pairing instability of the system. Upon solving the linearized
gap equations, we find that the PDW instability is robust against small
trigonal warping of the $\pm K$ pockets and small detuning between the $\Gamma$
and $\pm K$ pockets, which affect the PDW transition in a similar way as the
Zeeman magnetic field affects the uniform superconducting transition. We also
derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy for the PDW gaps with momenta $\pm
\mathbf{K}$, analyzing the conditions for and consequences of the emergence of
FF-type and LO-type PDW ground states. Our classification of the induced orders
in each ground state reveals unusual phases, including an odd-frequency
charge-$2e$ superconductor in the LO-type PDW.

<h3>Orbital-Active Dirac Materials from the Symmetry Principle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14510</a>
<br>
<i>Shenglong Xu, Congjun Wu</i>
<br>
Dirac materials, starting with graphene, have drawn tremendous research
interest in the past decade. Instead of focusing on the $p_z$ orbital as in
graphene, we go a step further and study orbital-active Dirac materials, where
the orbital degrees of freedom transform as a two-dimensional irreducible
representation of the point group. Examples of the orbital-active Dirac
materials occur in a broad class of systems, including transition metal oxide
heterostructures, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, germanene,
stanene, and optical lattices. We unify different systems based on the symmetry
principle. We show that the band structure of the orbital-active Dirac material
features Dirac cones at $K(K')$ and quadratic band touching points at $\Gamma$,
regardless of the origin of the orbital degrees of freedom. In the strong
anisotropy limit, flat bands appear due to the destructive interference of
hopping. These new features render the orbital-active Dirac material an even
wider playground for searching exotic states of matter, such as Dirac
semi-metal, ferromagnetism, Wigner crystallization, quantum spin Hall state,
and quantum anomalous Hall state.

<h3>Phase separation and dynamical arrest of protein solutions dominated by  short-range attractions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14663" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14663</a>
<br>
<i>Jan Hansen, Carolyn J. Moll, Leticia Lopez Flores, Ramon Castaneda-Priego, Magdaleno Medina-Noyola, Stefan U. Egelhaaf, Florian Platten</i>
<br>
The interplay of phase separation and dynamical arrest can lead to the
formation of gels and glasses, which is relevant for such diverse fields as
hard and soft condensed matter physics, materials science, food engineering and
pharmaceutical industry. Here, the non-equilibrium states as well as the
interactions of globular proteins are analyzed. Lysozyme in brine is chosen as
a model system with short-range attractions. The metastable gas-liquid binodal
and the dynamical arrest line as well as the second virial coefficient $B_2$
have been determined for various solution conditions by cloud-point
measurements, optical microscopy, centrifugation experiments and light
scattering. If temperature is expressed in terms of $B_2$, the binodals
obtained under various conditions fall onto a master curve, as suggested by the
extended law of corresponding states. Arrest lines for different salt
concentrations overlap within experimental errors, whereas they do not overlap
if the temperature axis is replaced by $B_2$. This indicates that the binodals
are not sensitive to the details of the potential, but can be described by one
integral parameter, i.e. $B_2$, whereas the arrest line appears governed by its
attractive part. The experimental findings are supported by numerical results
of the non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory.

<h3>Simulating structured fluids with tensorial viscoelasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14889</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos Floyd, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan, Aaron Dinner</i>
<br>
We consider an immersed elastic body that is actively driven through a
structured fluid by a motor or an external force. The behavior of such a system
generally cannot be solved analytically, necessitating the use of numerical
methods. However, current numerical methods omit important details of the
microscopic structure and dynamics of the fluid, which can modulate the
magnitudes and directions of viscoelastic restoring forces. To address this
issue, we develop a simulation platform for modeling viscoelastic media with
tensorial elasticity. We build on the lattice Boltzmann algorithm and
incorporate viscoelastic forces, elastic immersed objects, a microscopic
orientation field, and coupling between viscoelasticity and the orientation
field. We demonstrate our method by characterizing how the viscoelastic
restoring force on a driven immersed object depends on various key parameters
as well as the tensorial character of the elastic response. We find that the
restoring force depends non-monotonically on the rate of diffusion of the
stress and the size of the object. We further show how the restoring force
depends on the relative orientation of the microscopic structure and the
pulling direction. These results imply that accounting for previously neglected
physical features, such as stress diffusion and the microscopic orientation
field, can improve the realism of viscoelastic simulations. We discuss possible
applications and extensions to the method.

<h3>Extracting Wilson loop operators and fractional statistics from a single  bulk ground state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14302</a>
<br>
<i>Ze-Pei Cian, Mohammad Hafezi, Maissam Barkeshli</i>
<br>
An essential aspect of topological phases of matter is the existence of
Wilson loop operators that keep the ground state subspace invariant. Here we
present and implement an unbiased numerical optimization scheme to
systematically find the Wilson loop operators given a single ground state wave
function of a gapped Hamiltonian on a disk. We then show how these Wilson loop
operators can be cut and glued through further optimization to give operators
that can create, move, and annihilate anyon excitations. We subsequently use
these operators to determine the braiding statistics and topological twists of
the anyons, yielding a way to fully extract topological order from a single
wave function. We apply our method to the ground state of the perturbed toric
code and doubled semion models with a magnetic field that is up to a half of
the critical value. From a contemporary perspective, this can be thought of as
a machine learning approach to discover emergent 1-form symmetries of a ground
state wave function. From an application perspective, our approach can be
relevant to find Wilson loop operators in current quantum simulators.

<h3>On the "naturalness" of $d+ig$ superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14310</a>
<br>
<i>Andrew C. Yuan, Erez Berg, Steven A. Kivelson</i>
<br>
Many seemingly contradictory experimental findings concerning the
superconducting state in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ can be accounted for on the basis of a
conjectured accidental degeneracy between two patterns of pairing that are
unrelated to each other under the $(D_{4h})$ symmetry of the crystal: a
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave $(B_{1g})$ and a $g_{xy(x^2-y^2)}$-wave $(A_{2g})$
superconducting state. In this paper, we propose a generic multi-band model in
which the $g$-wave pairing involving the $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals arises from
second-nearest-neighbor interactions. Even if time-reversal symmetry is broken
- as in a $d+ig$ state - the superconductor remains gapless with a Bogoliubov
Fermi surface that approximates a (vertical) line node. The model gives rise to
a strain-dependent splitting between the critical temperature $T_c$ and the
time-reversal symmetry-breaking temperature $T_\text{trsb}$ that is
qualitatively similar to some of the experimental observations in
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

<h3>Phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene at filling factor $ν=-3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14322" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14322</a>
<br>
<i>Fang Xie, Jian Kang, B. Andrei Bernevig, Oskar Vafek, Nicolas Regnault</i>
<br>
We study the correlated insulating phases of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
in the absence of lattice strain at integer filling $\nu=-3$. Using
self-consistent Hartree-Fock method and allowing translation symmetry breaking
terms, we obtain the phase diagram with respect to the ratio of $AA$ interlayer
hopping $(w_0)$ and $AB$ interlayer hopping $(w_1)$. When the interlayer
hopping ratio is close to the chiral limit ($w_0/w_1 \lesssim 0.5$), a quantum
anomalous Hall state with Chern number $\nu_c = \pm 1$ can be observed
consistent with previous studies. Around the realistic value $w_0/w_1 \approx
0.8$, we find a spin and valley polarized, translation symmetry breaking, state
with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, a charge gap and a doubling of the moir\'e unit cell,
dubbed the $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase. The real space total charge distribution of
this $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase in the flat band limit does not have modulation
between different moir\'e unit cells, although the charge density in each layer
is modulated, and the translation symmetry is strongly broken. Other
symmetries, including $C_{2z}$, $C_{2x}$ and particle-hole symmetry $P$, and
the topology of the $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase are also discussed in detail. We
observed braiding and annihilation of the Dirac nodes by continuously turning
on the order parameter to its fully self-consistent value, and provide a
detailed explanation of the mechanism for the charge gap opening despite
preserving $C_{2z}T$ and valley $U(1)$ symmetries. In the transition region
between the quantum anomalous Hall phase and the $C_{2z}T$ stripe phase, we
find an additional competing state with comparable energy corresponding to a
phase with a tripling of the moir\'e unit cell.

<h3>Unconventional thermo-electric transport in tilted Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14331</a>
<br>
<i>Thorvald M. Ballestad, Alberto Cortijo, María A. H. Vozmediano, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</i>
<br>
We analyze the effect of the tilt on the transverse thermo-electric
coefficient of Weyl semimetals in the \emph{conformal} limit, i.e., zero
temperature and zero chemical potential. Using the Kubo formalism, we find a
non-monotonic behavior of the thermoelectric conductivity as a function of the
tilt perpendicular to the magnetic field, and a linear behavior when the tilt
is aligned to the magnetic field. An "axial Nernst" current (chiral currents
counter propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic field and the temperature
gradient) is generated in inversion symmetric materials when the tilt vector
has a projection in the direction of the magnetic field. This analysis will
help in the design and interpretation of thermo-electric transport experiments
in recently discovered topological quantum materials.

<h3>Constructing Non-Abelian Quantum Spin Liquids Using Combinatorial Gauge  Symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14333" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14333</a>
<br>
<i>Dmitry Green, Claudio Chamon</i>
<br>
We construct Hamiltonians with only 1- and 2-body interactions that exhibit
an exact non-Abelian gauge symmetry (specifically, combinatiorial gauge
symmetry). Our spin Hamiltonian realizes the quantum double associated to the
group of quaternions. It contains only ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic
$ZZ$ interactions, plus longitudinal and transverse fields, and therefore is an
explicit example of a spin Hamiltonian with no sign problem that realizes a
non-Abelian topological phase. In addition to the spin model, we propose a
superconducting quantum circuit version with the same symmetry.

<h3>Internal Energy, Fundamental Thermodynamic Relation, and Gibbs' Ensemble  Theory as Laws of Statistical Counting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14337</a>
<br>
<i>Hong Qian</i>
<br>
Counting ad infinitum is the holographic observable to a statistical dynamics
with finite states under independent repeated sampling. Entropy provides the
infinitesimal probability for an observed frequency $\hat{\boldsymbol{\nu}}$
w.r.t. a probability prior ${\bf p}$. Following Callen's postulate and through
Legendre-Fenchel transform, without help from mechanics, we show an internal
energy $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ emerges; it provides a linear representation of
real-valued observables with full or partial information. Gibbs' fundamental
thermodynamic relation and theory of ensembles follow mathematically.
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\nu}}$ what $\omega$ is to $t$ in
Fourier analysis.

<h3>Supersolid-like square- and triangular-lattice crystallization of  dipolar droplets in a box trap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14373" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14373</a>
<br>
<i>Luis E. Young-S., S. K. Adhikari</i>
<br>
Using a beyond-mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction,
we demonstrate a supersolid-like spatially-periodic square- and
triangular-lattice crystallization of droplets in a polarized dipolar
condensate confined by an appropriate three-dimensional (3D) box trap. In this
paper we consider a rectangular box (cuboid) trap, a square box (cuboid with
two equal sides) trap, a cylindrical box trap and a hexagonal box (hexagonal
prism) trap. The droplet lattice is always formed in the $x$-$y$ plane
perpendicular to the polarization $z$ direction of dipolar atoms. In contrast
to a harmonic trap, the box traps allow the formation of a large clean
supersolid-like spatially-periodic crystallization in free space without any
distortion. Moreover, a droplet lattice can be formed in a 3D box trap with a
significantly reduced number of atoms than in a harmonic trap, which could
facilitate the experimental observation of droplet lattice in a box trap. With
present know-how such a supersolid-like crystallization of dipolar droplets in
a 3D box trap can be realized in a laboratory thus allowing the study of a
large periodic lattice of dipolar droplets in free space bounded by rigid
walls.

<h3>Functional thin films as cathode/electrolyte interlayers: a strategy to  enhance the performance and durability of solid oxide fuel cells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14374</a>
<br>
<i>Marina Machado, Federico Baiutti, Lucile Bernadet, Alex Morata, Marc Nuñez, Jan Pieter Ouweltjes, Fabio Coral Fonseca, Marc Torrell, Albert Tarancónb</i>
<br>
Electrochemical devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) may greatly
benefit from the implementation of nanoengineered thin-film multifunctional
layers providing, alongside enhanced electrochemical activity, improved
mechanical, and long-term stability. In this study, an ultrathin (400 nm)
bilayer of samarium-doped ceria and a self-assembled nanocomposite made of
Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9-La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-$\delta$ was fabricated by pulsed laser
deposition and is employed as a functional oxygen electrode in an
anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell. Introducing the functional bilayer in
the cell architecture results in a simple processing technique for the
fabrication of high-performance fuel cells (power density 1.0 W.cm-2 at 0.7 V
and 750 $^\circ$C). Durability tests were carried out for up to 1500 h, showing
a small degradation under extreme operating conditions of 1 A.cm-2, while a
stable behaviour at 0.5 A.cm-2. Post-test analyses, including scanning and
transmission electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
demonstrate that the nanoengineered thin film layers remain mostly
morphologically stable after the operation.

<h3>Quantifying the trade-off between stiffness and permeability in  hydrogels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14382" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14382</a>
<br>
<i>Yiwei Gao, H. Jeremy Cho</i>
<br>
Hydrogels have a distinct combination of mechanical and water-transport
behaviors. As hydrogels stiffen, they become less permeable. Here, we combine
semi-dilute polymer theory with the Kozeny-Carman equation to develop a simple
scaling law describing the relationship between hydraulic permeability and
mechanical stiffness. We find that these properties are dictated by the polymer
strand spacing, explained via analogy of a bowl of noodle soup. We find a
remarkably close agreement between our scaling law and experimental results
across four different polymer families with varied crosslinkings.

<br>
In semiconductors, exciton or charge carrier diffusivity is typically
described as an inherent material property. Here, we show that the transport of
excitons (i.e., bound electron-hole pairs) in CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals
(NCs) depends markedly on how recently those NCs were occupied by a previous
exciton. Using fluence- and repetition-rate-dependent transient
photoluminescence microscopy, we visualize the effect of excitation frequency
on exciton transport in CsPbBr3 NC solids. Surprisingly, we observe a striking
dependence of the apparent exciton diffusivity on excitation laser power that
does not arise from nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions nor from thermal
heating of the sample. We interpret our observations with a model in which
excitons cause NCs to undergo a transition to a metastable configuration that
admits faster exciton transport by roughly an order of magnitude. This
metastable configuration persists for ~microseconds at room temperature, and
does not depend on the identity of surface ligands or presence of an oxide
shell, suggesting that it is an intrinsic response of the perovskite lattice to
electronic excitation. The exciton diffusivity observed here (>0.15 cm2/s) is
considerably higher than that observed in other NC systems on similar
timescales, revealing unusually strong excitonic coupling in a NC material. The
finding of a persistent enhancement in excitonic coupling between NCs may help
explain other extraordinary photophysical behaviors observed in CsPbBr3 NC
arrays, such as superfluorescence. Additionally, faster exciton diffusivity
under higher photoexcitation intensity is likely to provide practical insights
for optoelectronic device engineering.

<br>
We study the dynamical properties of point-like defects, represented by
monoatomic chalcogen vacancies, in WS$_2$-graphene and MoS$_2$-graphene
heterobilayers. Employing a multidisciplinary approach based on the combination
of \textit{ab initio}, model Hamiltonian and density matrix techniques, we
propose a minimal interacting model that allows for the calculation of
electronic transition times associated to population and depopulation of the
vacancy by an additional electron. We obtain the "coarse-grained" semiclassical
dynamics by means of a master equation approach and discuss the potential role
of virtual charge fluctuations in the internal dynamics of impurity
quasi-degenerate states. The interplay between the symmetry of the lattice and
the spin degree of freedom through the spin-orbit interaction and its impact on
charge quenching is studied in detail.

<h3>Conversion between metavalent and covalent bond in metastable  superlattices composed of 2D and 3D sublayers</h3>

<br>
Reversible conversion over multi-million-times in bond types between
metavalent and covalent bonds becomes one of the most promising bases for
universal memory. As the conversions have been found in metastable states,
extended category of crystal structures from stable states via redistribution
of vacancies, researches on kinetic behavior of the vacancies are highly on
demand. However, they remain lacking due to difficulties with experimental
analysis. Herein, the direct observation of the evolution of chemical states of
vacancies clarifies the behavior by combining analysis on charge density
distribution, electrical conductivity, and crystal structures. Site-switching
of vacancies gradually occurs with diverged energy barriers owing to a unique
activation code-the accumulation of vacancies triggers spontaneous gliding
along atomic planes to relieve electrostatic repulsion. Study on the behavior
can be further applied to multi-phase superlattices composed of Sb2Te3 (2D) and
GeTe (3D) sublayers, which represent the superior memory performances but their
operating mechanisms were still under debates due to their complexity. The
site-switching is favorable (suppressed) when Te-Te bonds are formed as
physisorption (chemisorption) over the interface between Sb2Te3 (2D) and GeTe
(3D) sublayers driven by configurational entropic gain (electrostatic enthalpic
loss). Depending on the type of interfaces between sublayers, phases of the
superlattices are classified into metastable and stable states, where the
conversion could be only achieved in the metastable state. From this
comprehensive understanding on the operating mechanism via kinetic behaviors of
vacancies and the metastability, further studies towards vacancy engineering
are expected in versatile materials.

<h3>Slippery paraelectric transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14437" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14437</a>
<br>
<i>Juan M. Marmolejo-Tejada, Joseph E. Roll, Shiva Prasad Poudel, Salvador Barraza-Lopez, Martin A. Mosquera</i>
<br>
Traditional ferroelectrics undergo thermally-induced phase transitions
whereby their structural symmetry increases. The associated higher-symmetry
structure is dubbed {\em paraelectric}. Ferroelectric transition metal
dichalcogenide bilayers have been recently shown to become paraelectric, but
not much has been said of the atomistic configuration of such a phase. As
discovered through numerical calculations that include molecular dynamics here,
their paraelectricity can only be ascribed to a time average of ferroelectric
phases with opposing intrinsic polarizations, whose switching requires
macroscopically large areas to slip in unison.

<h3>Diffusiophoresis in the presence of a pH gradient</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14442" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14442</a>
<br>
<i>Suin Shim, Janine K. Nunes, Guang Chen, Howard A. Stone</i>
<br>
Diffusiophoresis is the spontaneous motion of particles under gradients of
solutes. In electrolyte-driven diffusiophoresis, the zeta potential of the
particles is an important surface property that characterizes diffusiophoretic
mobility. However, the zeta potential is not a fixed material property and
colloidal surfaces often show varying potentials depending on the physical
chemistry of the surrounding fluid, e.g., solute type, ionic strength, and pH.
In this article, we study experimentally and theoretically pH-dependent
diffusiophoresis of polystyrene particles using a dead-end pore geometry. In
particular, the influence of the isoelectric point (pI) on diffusiophoresis is
demonstrated in the absence and presence of wall diffusioosmosis. Throughout
the paper, we show with experiments and model calculations how the pH-dependent
diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis influence the particle motion in dead-end
pore configurations, including changes that occur when there is a sign change
in the zeta potential near the pI.

<br>
We explore a solid state qubit defined on valley isospin of electron confined
in a gate-defined quantum dot created in an area of MoS$_2$/WS$_2$-monolayer
lateral junction. We show that a properly oriented junction with respect to the
monolayer lattice can induce intervalley transitions of electron confined in
the neighboring quantum dot when overlapping with the junction is significant
and pumping frequency tuned. The pumping scheme that induces transitions is
all-electrical: obtained by applying oscillating voltages to control gates and
thus enables for scalable qubit architectures. We also report another
possibility of valley-qubit manipulation by accumulating non-Abelian Berry
phase. To model nanodevice we solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation
in a tight-binding approach and obtain exact time-evolution of the valley-qubit
system. During the evolution we simultaneously solve the Poisson equation in
self-consistent manner with the Schr\"odinger equation, with the confinement
potential controlled via voltages applied to the local gates.

<br>
The electrocaloric (EC) effect and energy storage properties of eco-friendly
ferroelectric Ba0.9Sr0.1Ti1-xSnxO3 (BSTS-x) ceramics prepared by the
conventional solid-state reaction method were studied. Significant energy
efficiency exceeding 80% was found in our samples. In particular, BSTS-5 and
BSTS-10 samples exhibit 92% and 88% efficiency, respectively, over a wide
temperature range around room temperature (RT). Direct EC measurement and an
indirect method based on the thermodynamic approach were used to characterize
the EC effect, and both yielded consistent results. The largest electrocaloric
responsivity of 0.73 K mm/kV was obtained for BSTS-0 at 368 K with an adiabatic
temperature change DT(EC) of 0.55 K at a low applied electric field of only 7.4
kV/cm. With increasing Sn-content, the EC response of BSTS-x ceramics
decreases, while their diffuseness increases over an extensive temperature
range, centered at RT. A significant coefficient of performance (COP > 26) was
found for our samples. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of
designing eco-friendly materials with higher EC effect and energy efficiency
for potential solid-state refrigeration and energy storage devices.

<h3>Spin triangle chain with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic  interactions on the transition line</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14459</a>
<br>
<i>V. Ya. Krivnov, D. V. Dmitriev</i>
<br>
We investigate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic model of a linear chain of
triangles with competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions and
ferromagneic Heisenberg interactions between triangles. For a certain ratio
between interactions the one-magnon excitation band is dispersionless leading
to an existence of localized-magnon states which form macroscopically
degenerated ground states. The spectrum of excitations has a specific structure
depending on the value of the triangle-triangle interaction. Such specific
structure determines the low-temperature thermodynamics and, in particular, the
temperature dependence of a specific heat. In the limit of strong anisotropy of
interactions the spectrum has a multi-scale structure which consists of subsets
rank-ordered on small parameter. Each subset is responsible for the appearance
of the peak in the temperature dependence of the specific heat.

<h3>Stress focusing and damage protection in topological Maxwell  metamaterials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14463</a>
<br>
<i>Caleb Widstrand, Chen Hu, Xiaoming Mao, Joseph Labuz, Stefano Gonella</i>
<br>
Advances in the field of topological mechanics have highlighted a number of
special mechanical properties of Maxwell lattices, including the ability to
focus zero-energy floppy modes and states of self-stress (SSS) at their edges
and interfaces. Due to their topological character, these phenomena are
protected against perturbations in the lattice geometry and material
properties, which makes them robust against the emergence of structural
non-idealities, defects, and damage. Recent computational work has shown that
the ability of Maxwell lattices to focus stress along prescribed SSS domain
walls can be harnessed for the purpose of protecting other regions in the bulk
of the lattice from detrimental stress concentration and, potentially,
inhibiting the onset of fracture mechanisms at stress hot spots such as holes
and cracks. This property provides a powerful, geometry-based tool for the
design of lattice configurations that are robust against damage and fracture.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive experiment-driven exploration of this
idea in the context of realistic structural lattices characterized by
non-ideal, finite-thickness hinges. Our experiments document the onset of
pronounced domain wall stress focusing, indicating a remarkable robustness of
the polarization even in the presence of the dilutive effects of the structural
hinges. We also demonstrate that the polarization protects the lattice against
potential failure from defected hinges and cracks in the bulk. Finally, we
illustrate numerically the superiority of SSS domain walls compared to other
trivial forms of reinforcements.

<h3>Magnetic properties, electrical resistivity, and hardness of  high-entropy alloys FeCoNiPd and FeCoNiPt</h3>

<br>
We report the magnetic properties, electrical resistivity, and Vickers
microhardness of as-cast and annealed high-entropy alloys (HEAs) FeCoNiPd and
FeCoNiPt with the face-centered cubic structure. The heat treatment at 800
$^{\circ}$C does not largely affect the physical properties in each HEA. The
values of the Curie temperature and the saturation moment at 50 K are 955 K and
1.458 $\mu_\mathrm{B}$/f.u. for the annealed FeCoNiPd, and 851 K and 1.456
$\mu_\mathrm{B}$/f.u. for the annealed FeCoNiPt, respectively. Each HEA is a
soft ferromagnet and shows metallic resistivity. The electronic structure
calculations of both HEAs support the ferromagnetic ground states. The
comparisons between experimental and theoretical values are made for the Curie
temperature, the saturation moment, and the residual resistivity. The Vickers
microhardness of annealed FeCoNiPd and FeCoNiPt are both 188 HV. The hardness
vs. valence electron count (VEC) per atom plot of these HEAs does not largely
deviate from an expected universal relation forming a broad peak at
VEC$\sim$6.8. This study would give some hints on designing a soft
ferromagnetic HEA with high hardness.

<h3>Universal Anomaly of Dynamics at Phase Transition Points Induced by  Pancharatnam-Berry Phase</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14519</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Yuan Zhang, Xia Yin, Ming-Yu liu, Jize Zhao, Yang Ding, Jun Chang</i>
<br>
Recently, dynamical anomalies more than critical slowing down are often
observed near both the continuous and first-order phase transition points. We
propose that the universal anomalies could originate from the geometric phase
effects. A Pancharatnam-Berry phase is accumulated continuously in quantum
states with the variation of tuning parameters. Phase transitions are supposed
to induce a abrupt shift of the geometric phase. In our multi-level quantum
model, the quantum interference induced by the geometric phase could prolong or
shorten the relaxation times of excited states at phase transition points,
which agrees with the experiments, models under sudden quenches and our
semi-classical model. Furthermore, we find that by setting a phase shift of
\text{\ensuremath{\pi}}, the excited state could be decoupled from the ground
state by quantum cancellation so that the relaxation time even could diverge to
infinity. Our work introduces the geometric phase to the study of conventional
phase transitions and quantum phase transition, and could substantially extend
the dephasing time of qubits for quantum computing.

<br>
Ultrafast charge transfer processes provide a facile way to create interlayer
excitons and to generate single-cycle THz pulses in directly contacted
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers. More sophisticated
heterostructures composed of TMD/hBN/TMD can enable new ways to control the
charge transfer dynamics to achieve novel exciton phenomena, such as exciton
insulators and exciton condensates, where longer lifetimes are desired. In this
work, we experimentally study charge transfer dynamics in a heterostructure
composed of a 1-nm-thick hBN spacer between MoSe$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$
monolayers. We observe the interlayer charge transfer from MoSe$_{2}$ to
WSe$_{2}$ across hBN with a time constant of 500 ps, which is over three orders
of magnitude slower compared to the charge transfer between TMD layers without
an hBN spacer. Furthermore, we observe strong competition between the
interlayer charge transfer process with the intralayer exciton-exciton
annihilation process at high excitation densities. Our work opens possibilities
to understand charge transfer pathways in TMD/hBN/TMD heterostructures for the
efficient generation and control of interlayer excitons.

<h3>Nonlinearity and Parametric Amplification of Superconducting Nanowire  Resonators in Magnetic Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14523" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14523</a>
<br>
<i>M. Khalifa, J. Salfi</i>
<br>
Nonlinear superconducting devices, typically based on Josephson Junction (JJ)
nonlinearities, are the basis for superconducting quantum electronics,
enabling, e.g., the formation of isolated two-level superconducting qubits and
amplifiers. While emerging spin, hybrid spin/superconducting (including
Majorana), and nano-magneto-optical quantum systems could benefit tremendously
from superconducting nonlinearities, the presence of strong magnetic fields in
these systems are incompatible with conventional JJ devices, which are highly
sensitive to applied magnetic fields. One potential solution is the use of
kinetic inductance (KI) nonlinearity. To date, only linear kinetic inductance
(KI) devices have been shown to operate in high magnetic fields, while
nonlinear KI device operation in high magnetic fields has received virtually no
attention. Here, we study the nonlinearity of superconducting nanowire (NW) KI
resonators and their performance as parametric amplifiers for in-plane magnetic
fields. We study the Kerr coefficients of NW KI resonators made from 10 nm-thin
NbTiN films with characteristic impedance up to 3 k$\Omega$, and demonstrate
both nondegenerate and degenerate parametric amplification, at magnetic fields
up to 2 T, for the first time. We find that narrow KI resonators of width 0.1
$\mu$m are robust, in terms of gain, dynamic range and noise, to magnetic
fields up to $\sim$2 T, while wider KI resonators of width 1 $\mu$m suffer
significant suppression in the gain around at fields well below 2 T. Around 8
dB deamplification is observed for coherent states for a 0.1 $\mu$m KI
resonator, implying the capability of noise squeezing. These results open a new
pathway to developing nonlinear quantum devices that operate in or generate
high magnetic fields such as spin, hybrid spin/superconducting, and
magneto-opto-mechanical devices.

<h3>Quantum Interference and Coherent Population Trapping in a Double  Quantum Dot</h3>

<br>
Quantum interference is a natural consequence of wave-particle duality in
quantum mechanics, and is widely observed at the atomic scale. One interesting
manifestation of quantum interference is coherent population trapping (CPT),
first proposed in three-level driven atomic systems and observed in quantum
optical experiments. Here, we demonstrate CPT in a gate-defined semiconductor
double quantum dot (DQD), with some unique twists as compared to the atomic
systems. Specifically, we observe CPT in both driven and non-driven situations.
We further show that CPT in a driven DQD could be used to generate adiabatic
state transfer. Moreover, our experiment reveals a non-trivial modulation to
the CPT caused by the longitudinal driving field, yielding an odd-even effect
and a tunable CPT.

<br>
Spin qubits based on silicon-metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dots
(QDs) are promising platforms for a large-scale quantum computer. By
delocalizing an electron across a double quantum dots (DQD) charge state,
"flopping-mode" electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) is present in Si/SiGe QDs
via dispersive readout. Here, we demonstrate a flopping-mode spin qubit in a
Si-MOS QD via single-shot readout. When changing detuning, we achieve s-shape
spin resonance frequencies, an order of magnitude improvement in the spin Rabi
frequencies, and virtually constant spin dephasing times. Moreover, we confirm
the generality of flopping-mode EDSR by reproducing the EDSR spectra
measurement in a nearby DQD. Our results offer a new route to large-scale spin
qubit systems with higher control fidelities in Si-MOS quantum dots.

<br>
This report presents some of the key laboratory electrochemical battery
testing methods that are used in fuel cell research. Methods such as
voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy are of major importance. All the electrochemical
corrosion tests are performed through a tri-electrode polarization cell setup
containing a reference electrode, a counter electrode, and the working
electrode (metal sample of interest) in an electrolyte solution. All three
electrodes are connected to a potentiostat. Corrosion of metal occurs through
an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction. All the above testing methods can be
performed by manipulating the current and voltage responses from the cell.
Potentiostatic experiments (voltammetry and chronoamperometry) are performed
using constant potential at the working electrode and recording the current
response while galvanostatic experiments (chronopotentiometry) and vice versa.
The measured data through all these experiments can provide very useful
information regarding reaction reversibility, diffusion coefficient, reduction
potential, rate of chemical reaction, durability, adsorption, voltage losses,
and effective resistance to the mass and charge transport offered by electrode
material.

Polar surface and interface play a pivotal role for realizing exotic
properties of materials, and a search for such polar states is of crucial
importance for expanding materials' functionality. Here we report micro-focused
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of CsV3Sb5, a member of recently
discovered kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), and show evidence for
the polar nature of cleaved surface which is characterized by Cs- and
Sb-terminated surfaces with markedly different fermiology. The Cs-terminated
surface shows intriguing doubling of V-derived bands at low temperature
associated with the band folding due to the three-dimensional charge-density
wave (CDW), whereas the Sb-terminated one shows no band doubling or resultant
CDW-gap opening indicative of the suppression of bulk-originated CDW due to
polar charge. Such polar-surface-dependent band structure must be incorporated
for understanding the origin of unconventional superconducting and charge order
at the surface of AV3Sb5.

<h3>Diffusion of microstructured anisotropic particles in an external field</h3>

<br>
Microstructured particles are widely used in industries and state-of-the-art
research and development. Diffusion of particles, particularly, controlled
diffusion by a remotely applied field, has inspired novel applications ranging
from targeted drug deliveries, novel procedures for quantifying physical
properties of nanoparticles and ambient fluids, to fabrication of composites
with enhanced properties. In this work, we report a systematic analysis on
field-controlled diffusion of microstructured particles. In account of shape
anisotropy and structural heterogeneity of a particle, we study coupled
Brownian motions of the particle in $\mathbb{R}^3\times$SO(3). Starting from
the microscopic stochastic differential equations of motions, we achieve the
coarse-grained Fokker-Planck equation that governs the evolution of the
probability distribution function with respect to the position and orientation
of the particle. Under some mild conditions, we identify the long-time
diffusivity for microstructured particles in an external field. The formulation
is applicable to microstructured particles of arbitrary shapes and
heterogeneities. As examples of applications, we analyze the diffusion of a
heterogeneous spheroidal particle and a pair of spheroidal particles bonded by
an elastic ligament. For heterogeneous spheroidal particles, we obtain explicit
generalized Stokes-Einstein's relations for diffusivity that accounts for the
effects of shape anisotropy, heterogeneity, and an external alignment field.
For pairs of spheroidal particles, we consider the superimposed relaxation
process from an initial non-equilibrium state to the final equilibrium state.
The anomalous scaling of Mean Square Displacement (MSD) with respect to the
time of such processes may provide important insight for understanding
anomalous diffusions observed in migration of macromolecules and cells in
complex viscoelastic media.

We investigate magnetotransport on Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene whose
band structure consists of two massive subbands with different effective
masses. Under a finite displacement field, we observe valley splitting of
Landau levels (LLs) only in the light-mass subband, consistent with a
tight-binding model. At low density, we find unexpected magnetoconductance
oscillations in bulk gaps which originate from a series of hybridizations
between electron-like and hole-like LLs due to band inversion in tetralayer
graphene. In contrast to a trivial LL quantization gap, these inverted
hybridization gaps can lead to a change in number of edge states which explains
the observed oscillations.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is responsible for the rich phenomena in
equilibrium physics. Driving a system out-of-equilibrium can significantly
enrich the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which occurs not only
in space, but also in time domain. This study investigates a driven-dissipative
frustrated magnetic system. Results show that frustration in such a
far-from-equilibrium system could lead to a wealth of intriguing
non-equilibrium phases with intertwined space-time symmetry breaking, (e.g.) a
discrete time crystal phase accompanied by a time-dependent spatial order
oscillating between a long-range tripartite stripe and a short-range
ferromagnetic order.

<h3>Superatom Orbitals, Orbital Splitting and Structure Prediction of Pure  Alkali Metal Clusters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14589" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14589</a>
<br>
<i>Jin Liu, Zhi-Jie Yan, YI-Chao Jin, Meng Zhang</i>
<br>
Jellium model achieved great success in predicting stable clusters with
closed electronic shells and zero spin. In order to explain the stability of
open shell clusters, it is necessary to consider the case of non-degenerate
energy levels. In this paper the energy levels in nine low-lying Li$_{19}$
clusters are analysed systematically through superatomic orbital splitting
effect. It is found that for originally degenerate orbitals like five 1D
orbitals, the more the orbital extends in the direction of the cluster
extension, the lower the energy of the orbital becomes. So oblate Li$_{19}$
clusters have the orbital sequence of
$1\mathrm{S}^2-1\mathrm{P}_{x/y}^{4}-1\mathrm{P}_{z}^{2}-1\mathrm{D}_{xy/x^2-y^2}^{4}-2\mathrm{S}^2-1\mathrm{D}_{xz/yz}^{4}-1\mathrm{D}_{z^2}^{1}$,
while prolate Li$_{19}$ clusters have the sequence of
$1\mathrm{S}^2-1\mathrm{P}_{z}^{2}-1\mathrm{P}_{x/y}^{4}-1\mathrm{D}_{z^2}^{2}-1\mathrm{D}_{xz/yz}^{4}-1\mathrm{D}_{xy/x^2-y^2}^{4}-2\mathrm{S}^1$.
This electron configuration is applied to predict the shape and magnetic moment
of the alkali metal Li$_{n}$ clusters. The stability of the Li$_{14}$ cluster
can be successfully interpreted in the framework of orbital splitting effect
without resorting to the super valence bond (SVB) model, indicating a
non-spherical cluster can achieve good stability without meeting the magic
number. It is also proposed that the orbital splitting can be used to predict
the shape (prolate, oblate or sphere) and magnetic moment of clusters. 11 out
of 16 predicted shapes of Li$_n(n=3-18)$ are consistent with the results
obtained by the principle of minimum energy.

<br>
The consequences of hydrogen on the formation and growth of GP zones during
natural ageing in an Al-5Cu alloy is investigated experimentally down to the
atomic scale and numerically using ab initio calculations. As observed through
scanning/transmission electron microscopy, the hardening kinetic is delayed due
to a slower growth of GP zones during natural ageing when hydrogen is
incorporated. According to ab initio calculations, the delayed hardening
results from hydrogen trapped in vacancies that reduce significantly the
diffusion coefficient of copper and the self diffusion of aluminium. This
reduction of the diffusion coefficient is either due to hydrogen being in the
path of the atom that exchange with the vacancy (and increasing the energy
barrier) or due to hydrogen being dissociated from the vacancy (and leading to
a less stable state).

<br>
We study the dispersion of Kelvin waves propagating along single- and
half-quantum vortices in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates based
on the analysis of the Bogoloubov-de Genne equation. With the help of the
interpolating formula connecting the dispersion relations at low- and
high-wavenumber regime, we reveal the nontrivial dependence of the dispersion
relation of the Kelvin waves on the intercomponent interaction through the
change of the vortex core size of the vortical component. We also find the
splitting of the Kelvin mode dispersion into gapless and gapfull branches when
both components have overlapping single-quantized vortices.

<br>
The effect of electron irradiation with the energy of 2.5 MeV on the
temperature dependences of the resistivity of an optimally doped
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ single crystal has been studied. The temperature
dependences of both fluctuation conductivity $\sigma^\prime(T)$ and the
pseudogap $\Delta^*(T)$ on irradiation dose $\phi$ have been calculated within
the local pair model. Here we show that with an increase in $\phi$, the value
of $\rho(300 K)$ increases linearly, while $T_c$ decreases linearly.
Concurrently, the value of $\rho{100 K}$ increases nonlinearly, demonstrating a
feature for $\phi_3$ = 4.3 10$^{18}$ e/$cm^2$, which is also observed in the
number of other dose-dependent parameters.Regardless of the irradiation dose,
in the temperature range from $T_c$ up to $T_{01}$, $\sigma^\prime(T)$ obeys
the classical fluctuation theories of Aslamazov$-$Larkin and Maki$-$Thompson,
demonstrating 3D$-$2D crossover with increasing temperature. The crossover
temperature $T_0$ makes it possible to determine the coherence length along the
$c$-axis, $\xi_c(T)$, which increases by $\approx 3$ times under irradiation.
Furthermore, the range of superconducting fluctuations above $T_c$ also
noticeably increases.At $\phi$ = 0, the dependence $\Delta^*(T)$ typical for
single crystals containing pronounced twin boundaries is observed with a
maximum at $T_{pair}$ ~ 120 K and a distinct minimum at $T = T_{01}$. It was
determined for the first time that at $\phi_3$ = 4.3 10$^{18}$ the shape of
$\Delta^*(T)$ changes strongly and becomes the same as in optimally doped
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ single crystals with a very low pseudogap opening
temperature $T^*$ and noticeably reduced $T_{pair}$, while at $T_c(\phi)$ there
are no singularities.

<h3>Density of states in locally ordered amorphous organic semiconductors:  emergence of the exponential tails</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14640" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14640</a>
<br>
<i>S.V. Novikov</i>
<br>
We present a simple model of the local order in amorphous organic
semiconductors which naturally produces a spatially correlated exponential
density of states (DOS). The dominant contribution to the random energy
landscape is provided by electrostatic contributions from dipoles or
quadrupoles. An assumption of the preferable parallel orientation of neighbor
quadrupoles or antiparallel orientation of dipoles directly leads to the
formation of the exponential tails of the DOS even for a moderate size of the
ordered domains. The insensitivity of the exponential tail formation to the
details of the microstructure of the material suggests that this mechanism is
rather common in amorphous organic semiconductors.

<h3>Unconventional delocalization in a family of 3D Lieb lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14650" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14650</a>
<br>
<i>Jie Liu, Carlo Danieli, Jianxin Zhong, Rudolf A. Römer</i>
<br>
Uncorrelated disorder in generalized 3D Lieb models gives rise to the
existence of bounded mobility edges, destroys the macroscopic degeneracy of the
flat bands and breaks their compactly-localized states. We now introduce a mix
of order and disorder such that this degeneracy remains and the
compactly-localized states are preserved. We obtain the energy-disorder phase
diagrams and identify mobility edges. Intriguingly, for large disorder the
survival of the compactly-localized states induces the existence of delocalized
eigenstates close to the original flat band energies -- yielding seemingly
divergent mobility edges. For small disorder, however, a change from extended
to localized behavior can be found upon decreasing disorder -- leading to an
unconventional ``inverse Anderson" behavior. We show that transfer matrix
methods, computing the localization lengths, as well as sparse-matrix
diagonalization, using spectral gap-ratio energy-level statistics, are in
excellent quantitative agreement. The preservation of the compactly-localized
states even in the presence of this disorder might be useful for envisaged
storage applications.

<br>
<i>Yukihiro Matsubayashi, Sumio Ishihara</i>
<br>
We investigate resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the O $K$-edge
in insulating cuprates by means of three methods: cluster perturbation theory
(CPT), Hartree--Fock approximation (HFA) and exact diagonalization (ED) method.
We consider the three-band Hubbard model and show the overall
momentum-dependence of the Zhang--Rice singlet (ZRS) excitation and
charge-transfer excitation by the CPT combining with the perturbation scheme. A
comparison of the RIXS spectra calculated using CPT and HFA reveals different
momentum-dependencies through the changes in the properties of the upper
Hubbard band and the ZRS band. These findings are supported by analyses using
the ED method on the RIXS spectra and dynamical charge structure factor.

<br>
We report the comprehensive comparative analysis of the upper critical
magnetic fields $\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$ obtained within Ginzburg-Landau and
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theories for optimally-doped
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ thin films. For different orientations of the magnetic
field, our calculations give 638 and 153 T for $\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$, H || ab and
$\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$, H || c, respectively, when using $H_{c2}(0)$. For the first
time, the temperature dependences of coherence lengths $\xi_{ab}(T)$ and
$\xi_{c}(T)$ within proposed theories were determined using 50 and 90% criteria
of the normal state resistivity value $\rho_{N}$. The Ginzburg-Landau
0.9$\rho_{N}$ approach gives $\xi_{ab}(0)$=11.8 A, and $\xi_{c}(0)$=3.0 A which
are in a good agreement with literature data. The implications of very short
coherence lengths in HTSCs are discussed.

<br>
Oxide heterostructures exhibit many intriguing properties. Here we provide
design principles for inducing multiple topological states in (001)
($AM$O$_3$)$_1$/($AM'$O$_3$)$_1$ oxide superlattices. Aided by first-principles
calculations and model analysis, we show that a (Sr$M$O3)$_1$/(Sr$M'$O$_3$)$_1$
superlattice ($M$ = Nb, Ta and $M'$ = Rh, Ir) is a strong topological insulator
with $Z_2$ index (1;001). More remarkably, a (SrMoO3)$_1$/(SrIrO3)$_1$
superlattice exhibits multiple coexisting topological insulator (TI) and
topological Dirac semi-metal (TDS) states. The TDS state has a pair of type-II
Dirac points near the Fermi level and symmetry-protected Dirac node lines. The
surface TDS Dirac cone is sandwiched by two surface TI Dirac cones in the
energy-momentum space. The non-trivial topological properties arise from the
band inversion between $d$ orbitals of two dissimilar transition metal atoms
and a particular parity property of (001) superlattice geometry. Our work
demonstrates how to induce nontrivial topological states in (001) perovskite
oxide heterostructures by rational design.

<h3>The importance of electronic correlations in exploring the exotic phase  diagram of layered Li$_x$MnO$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Hrishit Banerjee, Clare P. Grey, Andrew J. Morris</i>
<br>
Using ab initio dynamical mean-field theory we explore the electronic and
magnetic states of layered Li$_x$MnO$_2$ as a function of $x$, the state of
charge. Constructing real-space Wannier projections of Kohn-Sham orbitals based
on the low-energy subspace of Mn $3d$ states and solving a multi-impurity
problem, our approach focuses on local correlations at Mn sites. The
antiferromagnetic insulating state in LiMnO$_2$ has a moderate N\'{e}el
temperature of $T_N=296\,K$ in agreement with experimental studies. Upon
delithiation the system proceeds through a number of states: ferrimagnetic
correlated metals at $x$=0.92, 0.83; multiple charge disproportionated
ferromagnetic correlated metals with large quasiparticle weights at $x$=0.67,
0.50, 0.33; ferromagnetic metals with small quasiparticle weights at $x$=0.17,
0.08 and an antiferromagnetic insulator for the fully delithiated state,
$x=0.0$. At moderate states of charge, $x=0.67-0.33$, a mix of +3/+4 formal
oxidation states of Mn is observed, while the overall nominal oxidation of Mn
state changes from +3 in LiMnO$_2$ to +4 in MnO$_2$. In all these cases the
high-spin state emerges as the most likely state in our calculations
considering the full $d$~manifold of Mn based on the proximity of $e_g$ levels
in energy to $t_{2g}$. The quasiparticle peaks in the correlated metallic
states were attributed to polaronic states based on previous literature for
similar isoelectronic JT driven materials.

<h3>Overcoming temperature limits in the optical cooling of solids using  light-dressed states</h3>

<br>
Laser cooling of solids currently has a temperature floor of 50-100 K. We
propose a method that could overcome this using defects, such as diamond color
centers, with narrow electronic manifolds and bright optical transitions. It
exploits the dressed states formed in strong fields which extend the set of
phonon transitions and have tunable energies. This allows an enhancement of the
cooling power and diminishes the effect of inhomogeneous broadening. We
demonstrate these effects theoretically for the silicon vacancy and discuss the
role of background absorption and non-radiative decay.

<h3>Switching Rashba spin-splitting by reversing electric-field direction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14722</a>
<br>
<i>San-Dong Guo, Jing-Xin Zhu, Hao-Tian Guo, Bing Wang, Guang-Zhao Wang, Yee-Sin Ang</i>
<br>
The manipulation of the Rashba spin-splitting is crucial for the development
of nanospintronic technology. Here, it is proposed that the Rashba
spin-splitting can be turned on and off by reversing electric-field direction.
By the first-principle calculations, our proposal is illustrated by a concrete
example of Janus monolayer RbKNaBi. The designed RbKNaBi possesses dynamical,
thermal and mechanical stability, and is a large-gap quantum spin Hall
insulator (QSHI) with Rashba spin-splitting near the Fermi level. A small
built-in electric field is predicted due to very small electronegativity
difference between the bottom and top atoms, which is very key to switch Rashba
spin-splitting through the experimentally available electric field intensity.
Due to out-of-plane structural asymmetry, the Janus monolayer has distinctive
behaviors by applying external electric field $E$ with the same magnitude but
different directions ($z$ or $-z$). Our results reveal that the Rashba energy
($E_R$) and Rashba constant ($\alpha_R$) are increased by the positive $E$,
while a negative $E$ suppresses the Rashba splitting to disappear, and then
appears again. In a certain $E$ region (0.15 $\mathrm{V/\AA}$ to 0.25
$\mathrm{V/\AA}$), switching Rashba spin-splitting can be achieved by only
reversing electric-field direction. Besides, the piezoelectric strain
coefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ (5.52 pm/V and -0.41 pm/V) are predicted,
which are higher than or compared with those of many 2D materials. By
piezoelectric effect, the strain can also be used to tune Rashba spin-splitting
of RbKNaBi. Moreover, a possible spintronic device is proposed to realize the
function of spintronic switch.

<br>
In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a twist-angle-dependent competition
between interlayer stacking energy and intralayer elastic energy results in
flat rigid layers at large twist angles and lattice reconstruction at small
twist angles. Despite enormous scientific interest and effort in the TBG,
however, an experimental study of evolution from the rigid lattice to the
reconstructed lattice as a function of twist angle is still missing. Here we
present a scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study to reveal the
twist-angle-dependent lattice reconstruction in the TBG. Our experiment
demonstrates that there is a transition regime between the rigid regime and the
relaxed regime and, unexpectedly, the reconstructed and unreconstructed
structures coexist in the transition regime. The coexistence of the two
distinct structures in this regime may arise from subtle balance between the
interlayer stacking energy and intralayer elastic energy in the TBG with
intermediate moir\'e sizes.

<br>

<br>
The mobility edge (ME) that marks the energy separating extended and
localized states is a central concept in understanding the metal-insulator
transition induced by disordered or quasiperiodic potentials. MEs have been
extensively studied in three dimensional disorder systems and one-dimensional
quasiperiodic systems. However, the studies of MEs in two dimensional (2D)
systems are rare. Here we propose a class of 2D vertex-decorated Lieb lattice
models with quasiperiodic potentials only acting on the vertices of a
(extended) Lieb lattice. By mapping these models to the 2D Aubry-Andr\'{e}
model, we obtain exact expressions of MEs and the localization lengths of
localized states, and further demonstrate that the flat bands remain unaffected
by the quasiperiodic potentials. Finally, we propose a highly feasible scheme
to experimentally realize our model in a quantum dot array. Our results open
the door to studying and realizing exact MEs and robust flat bands in 2D
systems.

<br>
<i>Gaurab Rimal, Alessandro R. Mazza, Matthew Brahlek, Seongshik Oh</i>
<br>
Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow multi-elemental oxides (MEO) is
generally challenging, partly due to difficulty in stoichiometry control.
Occasionally, if one of the elements is volatile at the growth temperature,
stoichiometry control can be greatly simplified using adsorption-controlled
growth mode. Otherwise, stoichiometry control remains one of the main hurdles
to achieving high quality MEO film growths. Here, we report another kind of
self-limited growth mode, dubbed diffusion-assisted epitaxy, in which excess
species diffuses into the substrate and leads to the desired stoichiometry, in
a manner similar to the conventional adsorption-controlled epitaxy.
Specifically, we demonstrate that using diffusion-assisted epitaxy,
high-quality epitaxial CuCrO$_2$ films can be grown over a wide growth window
without precise flux control using MBE.

<h3>Ab initio study of metastable occupation of tetrahedral sites in  palladium hydrides and its impact on superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14773</a>
<br>
<i>Antonella Meninno, Ion Errea</i>
<br>
A recent experimental work on palladium hydrides suggested that metastable
structures with hydrogen atoms occupying tetrahedral sites could lead to
superconductivity above 50 K, a huge increase compared to the 10 K critical
temperature of the stable structure with all hydrogen atoms occupying
octahedral sites. By generating many structures with hydrogen atoms randomly
occupying the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the face-centered cubic
lattice and calculating their energy at different theoretical levels from first
principles, we determine that metastable structures with partial or full
occupation of tetrahedral sites are possible, even when the ionic quantum
zero-point energy and anharmonicity are included in the calculations.
Anharmonicity is crucial in palladium hydrides when hydrogen atoms occupy
octahedral sites and, in fact, makes the structure with full octahedral
occupation the ground state. Despite the metastable existence of structures
with full or partial tetrahedral sites occupation, the superconducting critical
temperature is reduced with the number of tetrahedral sites occupied. Our
calculations discard that the occupation of tetrahedral sites can increase the
critical temperature in palladium hydrides.

<h3>Low-field magnetic anomalies in single crystals of the A-type  square-lattice antiferromagnet EuGa$_4$</h3>

<br>
<i>Santanu Pakhira, D. C. Johnston</i>
<br>
The body-centered-tetragonal antiferromagnet EuGa$_4$ was recently identified
as a Weyl nodal-line semimetal that exhibits the topological Hall effect below
its reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperature $T_{\rm N}= 15$-16.5
K which we find to be $T_{\rm N} = 16.4(2)$ K. The Eu$^{+2}$ ions are located
at the corners and body center of the unit cell. EuGa$_4$ exhibits A-type AFM
order below $T_{\rm N}$, where the Eu$^{2+}$ spin-7/2 moments are
ferromagnetically aligned in the $ab$ plane with the Eu moments in adjacent Eu
planes along the $c$ axis aligned antiferromagnetically. Low-field
magnetization versus field $M(H_{ab})$ data at $T=2$ K with the field aligned
in the $ab$ plane are reported that exhibit anomalous positive curvature up to
a critical field $H_{c1}$ at which a second-order transition occurs with
$H_{c1}\approx 0.85$ kOe for ${\bf H}\parallel [1,1,0]$ and $\approx 4.8$ kOe
for ${\bf H}\parallel [1,0,0]$. For larger fields, a linear behavior $M_{ab} =
\chi(T_{\rm N})H_{ab}$ is followed until the previously-reported critical field
$H^{\rm c}_{ab} = 71$ kOe is reached at which all moments become aligned with
the applied field. A theory is formulated for $T=0$ K that fits the observed
$M(H_{ab})$ behavior at $T=2$ K well, where domains of A-type AFM order with
fourfold rotational symmetry occur in the AFM state in zero field. The moments
in the four domains reorient to become almost perpendicular to ${\bf H}_{ab}$
at $H_{c1}$, followed by increasing canting of all moments toward the field
with increasing field up to $H^{\rm c}_{ab}$. A first-order transition in
$M(H_{ab})$ at $H_{ab}=H_{\rm c1}$ is predicted by the theory for $T=0$ K when
${\bf H}_{ab}$ is at a small angle from the [1,0,0] or [1,1,0] directions.

Polymers are a vital part of everyday life. Their chemical universe is so
large that it presents unprecedented opportunities as well as significant

<h3>Tunable symmetry-protected higher-order topological states with  fermionic atoms in bilayer optical lattices</h3>

<i>Zhoutao Lei, Linhu Li, Yuangang Deng</i>
<br>
Higher-order topological states that possess gapped bulk energy bands and
exotic topologically protected boundary states with at least two dimension
lower than the bulk have significantly opened a new perspective for
understanding of topological quantum matters. Here, we propose to generate
two-dimensional topological boundary states for implementing synthetic magnetic
flux of ultracold atoms trapped in bilayer optical lattices, which includes
Chern insulator, Dirac semimetals, and second-order topological phase (SOTP) by
the interplay of the two-photon detuning and effective Zeeman shift. These
observed topological phases can be well characterized by the energy gap of
bulk, Wilson loop spectra, and the spin textures at the higher symmetric points
of system. We show that the SOTP exhibits a pair of $0$D boundary states. While
the phases of Dirac semimetals and Chern insulator support the conventional
$1$D boundary states due to the principle of bulk-boundary correspondence.
Strikingly, the emerged boundary states for Dirac semimetals and SOTP are
topologically protected by $\cal P T$-symmetry and chiral-mirror symmetry
($\mathcal{\widetilde{M}}_{\alpha}$), respectively. In particular, the location
of $0$D corner states for SOTP which are associated with existing
$\mathcal{\widetilde{M}}_{\alpha}$-symmetry can be highly manipulated by tuning
magnetic flux. Our scheme herein provides a platform for emerging exotic
topological boundary states, which may facilitate the study of higher-order
topological phases in ultracold atomic gases.

<br>
We consider a two-particle interferometer, where voltage sources applied to
ohmic contacts inject electronic excitations into a pair of copropagating edge
channels. We analyze the impact of channel mixing due to inter-edge tunneling
on the current noise measured at the output of the interferometer. Due to this
mixing, the noise suppression typically expected for synchronized injecting
sources is incomplete, thereby reducing the visibility of the interference. We
investigate to which extent the impact of mixing on the noise visibility
depends on different shapes of the voltage drives. Furthermore, we compare a
simple model involving a single mixing point between the sources and the
quantum point contact to the more realistic case of a continuous distribution
of weak mixing points.

<br>
The noncentrosymmetric superconductor Ru$_7$B$_3$ has in previous studies
demonstrated remarkably unusual behaviour in its vortex lattice, where the
nearest neighbour directions of the vortices dissociate from the crystal
lattice and instead show a complex field-history dependence, and the vortex
lattice rotates as the field is changed. In this study, we look at the vortex
lattice form factor of Ru$_7$B$_3$ during this field-history dependence, to
check for deviations from established models, such as the London model. We find
that the data is well described by the anisotropic London model, which is in
accordance with theoretical predictions that the alterations to the structure
of the vortices due to broken inversion symmetry should be small. From this, we
also extract values for the penetration depth and coherence length.

The magnetization dynamics in nanostructures has been extensively studied in
the last decades, and nanomagnetism has evolved significantly over that time,
discovering new effects, developing numerous applications, and identifying
promising new directions. This includes magnonics, an emerging research field
oriented on the study of spin-wave dynamics and their applications. In this
context, thin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)
offer interesting opportunities to study spin waves, in particular, due to
out-of-plane magnetization in remanence or at relatively weak external magnetic
fields. This is the only magnetization configuration offering isotropic
in-plane spin-wave propagation within the sample plane, the forward volume
magnetostatic spin-wave geometry. The isotropic dispersion relation is highly
important in designing signal-processing devices, offering superior prospects
for direct replicating various concepts from photonics into magnonics.
Analogous to photonic or phononic crystals, which are the building blocks of
optoelectronics and phononics, magnonic crystals are considered as key
components in magnonics applications. Arrays of nanodots and structured
ferromagnetic thin films with a periodic array of holes, popularly known as
antidot lattices based on PMA multilayers have been recently studied. Novel
magnonic properties related to propagating spin-wave modes, exploitation of the
band gaps, and confined modes, were demonstrated. Also, the existence of
nontrivial magnonic band topologies has been shown. Moreover, the combination
of PMA and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to the formation of chiral
magnetization states, including N\'eel domain walls, skyrmions, and skyrmionium
states.

The most accurate theoretical method to describe excitons is the solution of
the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the GW approximation (GW-BSE). However, because
of its computation cost, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is
becoming the alternative approach to GW-BSE to describe excitons in solids.
Nowadays, the most efficient strategy to describe optical spectra of solids in
TDDFT is to use long-range corrected exchange-correlation kernels on top of GW
or scissor-corrected energies. In recent years, a different strategy based on
range-separated hybrid functionals started to be developed in the framework of
time-dependent generalised Kohn-Sham density functional theory (TDGKSDFT).
Here, we compare the performance of long-range corrected kernels with
range-separated hybrid functionals for the description of excitons in solids.
This comparison has the purpose to weight the pros and cons of using
range-separated hybrid functionals, giving new perspectives for theoretical
developments of these functionals. We illustrate the comparison for the case of
Si and LiF, representative of solid state excitons.

<h3>Protein solutions close to liquid-liquid phase separation exhibit a  universal osmotic equation of state and dynamical behavior</h3>

<br>
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of protein solutions is governed by
highly complex protein-protein interactions. Nevertheless, it has been
suggested that based on the extended law of corresponding states (ELCS), as
proposed for colloids with short-range attractions, one can rationalize not
only the thermodynamics, but also the structure and dynamics of such systems.
This claim is systematically and comprehensively tested here by static and
dynamic light scattering experiments. Spinodal lines, the isothermal osmotic
compressibility $\kappa_\text{T}$ and the relaxation rate of concentration
fluctuations $\Gamma$ are determined for protein solutions in the vicinity of
LLPS. All these quantities are found to exhibit a corresponding-states
behavior. This means that, for different solution conditions, these quantities
are essentially the same if considered at similar reduced temperature or second
virial coefficient. For moderately concentrated solutions, the volume fraction
$\phi$ dependence of $\kappa_\text{T}$ and $\Gamma$ can be consistently
described by Baxter's model of adhesive hard spheres. The off-critical,
asymptotic $T$ behavior of $\kappa_\text{T}$ and $\Gamma$ close to LLPS is
consistent with the scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory. Thus, the
present work aims at a comprehensive experimental test of the applicability of
the ELCS to structural and dynamical properties of concentrated protein
solutions.

<br>
This article investigates how the acoustic propulsion of cone-shaped
colloidal particles that are exposed to a traveling ultrasound wave depends on
the viscosity of the fluid surrounding the particles. Using acoustofluidic
computer simulations, we found that the propulsion of such nano- and microcones
decreases strongly and even changes sign for increasing shear viscosity. In
contrast, we found only a weak dependence of the propulsion on the bulk
viscosity. The obtained results are in line with the findings of previous
theoretical and experimental studies.

<h3>Particulate suspension coating of capillary tubes</h3>

<br>
The displacement of a suspension of particles by an immiscible fluid in a
capillary tube or in a porous media is a canonical configuration that finds
application in a large number of natural and industrial applications, including
water purification, dispersion of colloids and microplastics, coating and
functionalization of tubings. The influence of particles dispersed in the fluid
on the interfacial dynamics and on the properties of the liquid film left
behind remain poorly understood. Here, we study the deposition of a coating
film on the walls of a capillary tube induced by the translation of a
suspension plug pushed by air. We identify the different deposition regimes as
a function of the translation speed of the plug, the particle size, and the
volume fraction of the suspension. The thickness of the coating film is
characterized, and we show that similarly to dip coating, three coating
regimes, liquid only, heterogeneous, and thick films, are observed. We also
show that, at first order, the thickness of films thicker than the particle
diameter can be predicted using the effective viscosity of the suspension.
Nevertheless, we also report that for large particles and concentrated
suspensions, a shear-induced migration mechanism leads to local variations in
volume fraction and modifies the deposited film thickness and composition.

<h3>A proof of crystallization via stratafication</h3>

<br>
<i>Leonard Kreutz, Manuel Friedrich</i>
<br>
We devise a new technique to prove two-dimensional crystallization results in
the square lattice for finite particle systems. We apply this strategy to
energy minimizers of configurational energies featuring two-body short-ranged
particle interactions and three-body angular potentials favoring bond-angles of
the square lattice. To each configuration, we associate its bond graph which is
then suitably modified by identifying chains of successive atoms. This method,
called stratification, reduces the crystallization problem to a simple
minimization that corresponds to a proof via slicing of the isoperimetric
inequality in $\ell^1$. As a byproduct, we also prove a fluctuation estimate
for minimizers of the configurational energy, known as the $n^{3/4}$-law.

<h3>Majorana corner modes and flat-band Majorana edge modes in  superconductor/topological-insulator/superconductor junctions</h3>

Recently, superconductors with higher-order topology have stimulated
extensive attention and research interest. Higher-order topological
superconductors exhibit unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence, thus allow
exotic lower-dimensional boundary modes, such as Majorana corner and hinge
modes. However, higher-order topological superconductivity has yet to be found
in naturally occurring materials. In this work, we investigate higher-order
topology in a two-dimensional Josephson junction comprised of two $s$-wave
superconductors separated by a topological insulator thin film. We found that
zero-energy Majorana corner modes, a boundary fingerprint of higher-order
topological superconductivity, can be achieved by applying magnetic field. When
an in-plane Zeeman field is applied to the system, two corner states appear in
the superconducting junction. Furthermore, we also discover a two dimensional
nodal superconducting phase which supports flat-band Majorana edge modes
connecting the bulk nodes. Importantly, we demonstrate that zero-energy
Majorana corner modes are stable when increasing the thickness of topological
insulator thin film.

<h3>Evaluation of Neel temperatures from fully self-consistent  broken-symmetry GW and high-temperature expansion: application to cubic  transition-metal oxides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14904" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14904</a>
<br>
<i>Pavel Pokhilko, Dominika Zgid</i>
<br>
Using fully self-consistent thermal broken-symmetry GW we construct effective
magnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonians for a series of transition metal oxides (NiO,
CoO, FeO, MnO), capturing a rigorous but condensed description of the magnetic
states. Then applying high-temperature expansion, we find the decomposition
coefficients for spin susceptibility and specific heat. The radius of
convergence of the found series determine the Neel temperature. The NiO, CoO,
and FeO contain a small ferromagnetic interaction between the nearest neighbors
(NN) and the dominant antiferromagnetic interaction between the next-nearest
neighbors (NNN). For them the derived Neel temperatures are in a good agreement
with experiment. The case of MnO is different because both NN and NNN couplings
are antiferromagnetic and comparable in magnitude, for which the error in the
estimated Neel temperature is larger, which is a signature of additional
effects not captured by electronic structure calculations.

<h3>Variational quantitative phase-field modeling of non-isothermal  sintering process</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14913</a>
<br>
<i>Timileyin David Oyedeji, Yangyiwei Yang, Herbert Egger, Bai-Xiang Xu</i>
<br>
In this work, we present for the first time a variational and quantitative
phase-field model for non-isothermal sintering processes. The model is derived
via an extended non-diagonal model with no restriction on the range of
diffusivity ratio. The model evolution equations have naturally cross-coupling
terms between the conserved kinetics (i.e., mass and thermal transfer) and the
non-conserved one (grain growth). These terms are shown via asymptotic analysis
to be instrumental in ensuring the elimination of interface artefacts.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the trapping effects and existence of surface
diffusion in conservation laws are direction-dependent. An anisotropic
interpolation scheme of the kinetic mobilities which differentiates the normal
and the tangential directions along the interface is discussed. Numerically, we
demonstrate the importance of the cross-couplings and the anisotropic
interpolation. Also, we present microstructural results obtained using the
model.

<h3>Charge transport in the spatially correlated exponential random energy  landscape: effect of the non-positive correlation function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14955</a>
<br>
<i>S.V. Novikov</i>
<br>
Charge transport in amorphous semiconductors having spatially correlated
exponential density of states (DOS) has been considered for the arbitrary
behavior of the correlation function of random energies. Average carrier
velocity is exactly calculated for the quasi-equilibrium (nondispersive)
transport regime. For the symmetric exponential DOS with exponential tails for
low and high energies and non-positive correlation function the temperature for
the transition to the dispersive transport regime depends on correlation
properties and becomes greater than the traditional estimation based on the DOS
decay energy $kT=U_0$. Another new feature of the transport in the landscape
having non-positive correlation function is the decay of the mobility with
field in low field region.

In his comment [arXiv:2209.03235], S. W. Lovesey argues that our analysis of
neutron scattering experiments performed on Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is invalid.
Lovesey argues that we have not properly accounted for the higher-order
multipolar contributions to the magnetic scattering and that our use of
pseudospin-$1/2$ operators to describe the scattering is inappropriate. In this
reply, we show that the multipolar corrections discussed by Lovesey only become
significant at scattering wavevectors exceeding those accessed in our
experiments. This in no way contradicts or undermines our work, which never
claimed a direct observation of scattering from higher-order multipoles. We
further show that Lovesey's objections to our use of pseudospins are unfounded,
and that the pseudospin operators are able to describe all magnetic scattering
processes at the energy scale of our experiments, far below the crystal field
gap. Finally, we comment on certain assumptions in Lovesey's calculations of
the scattering amplitude which are inconsistent with experiment.

<h3>Site-specific atomic substitution in a giant magnetocaloric Fe$_2$P-type  system</h3>

<br>
Giant magnetocaloric (GMC) materials constitute a requirement for near room
temperature magnetic refrigeration. (Fe,Mn)$_2$(P,Si) is a GMC compound with
strong magnetoelastic coupling. The main hindrance towards application of this
material is a comparably large temperature hysteresis, which can be reduced by
metal site substitution with a nonmagnetic element. However, the
(Fe,Mn)$_2$(P,Si) compound has two equally populated metal sites, the
tetrahedrally coordinated $3f$ and the pyramidally coordinated $3g$ sites. The
magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of such compounds are highly sensitive
to the site specific occupancy of the magnetic atoms. Here we have attempted to
study separately the effect of $3f$ and $3g$ site substitution with equal
amounts of vanadium. Using formation energy calculations, the site preference
of vanadium and its influence on the magnetic phase formation are described. A
large difference in the isothermal entropy change (as high as 44\%) with
substitution in the $3f$ and $3g$ sites is observed. The role of the lattice
parameter change with temperature and the strength of the magnetoelastic
coupling on the magnetic properties are highlighted.

<h3>Molecular dynamics approaches for determination of elastic parameters of  lipid membranes</h3>

Lipid membranes are abundant in living organisms, where they constitute a
surrounding shell for cells and their organelles. There are a lot of
circumstances in which the deformations of lipid membranes are involved in
living cells: fusion and fission, membrane mediated interaction between
membrane components, lipid-protein interaction, formation of pores, etc. In all
of these cases, elastic parameters of lipid membranes are important for the
description of membrane deformations, as these parameters determine energy
barriers and characteristic times of membrane-involved phenomena. Since the
development of molecular dynamics (MD), a variety of methods have been proposed
for the determination of elastic parameters of in silico simulated lipid
membranes. MD approaches are characterized by their own peculiarities in
comparison with experiments, allowing the consideration of details unattainable
in experimental techniques. These MD approaches represent a distinct scientific
field, which is rapidly developing. In this work, we review these MD approaches
and describe their capabilities, applicability conditions, problems, advantages
and disadvantages in comparison with each other, existing challenges, and
directions for further development.

<h3>Ferromagnetism on an atom-thick and extended 2D-metal-organic framework</h3>

<br>
Ferromagnetism (FM) is the cornerstone of permanent magnets, data storage and
other technologies that directly impact our everyday life by their
implementation in standard applications and devices. When downscaling bulk
materials into their two-dimensional (2D) magnetic isotropic form, the
Mermin-Wagner theorem precludes this collective state mediated by short-range
exchange interactions at finite temperatures. Interestingly, this prediction
fails when significant magnetic anisotropy is present in the material, as
recently demonstrated in single layered van der Waals crystals. Before the
latter, single layer metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) grown on metallic supports
were one of the earliest candidates for achieving 2D-FM. Such high expectations
were based on the chemical and spacing control of the 2D-MOF magnetic centers,
the tunability of the organic linkers and the rich self-assembled architectures
displayed. However, despite many attempts, extended FM in 2D-MOFs has been
experimentally elusive. In this work, we demonstrate that extended, cooperative
FM takes place in an atom thick 2D-MOF consisting of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene
(DCA) molecules and Fe adatoms grown on Au(111). We show this by means of an
experimental multitechnique approach that is endorsed by state-of-the art
first-principles calculations. Particularly, this 2D ferromagnet follows a
first order transition with TC ~ 35 K, which is driven by exchange interactions
mainly through the molecular linkers (J=2 meV) and exhibits an out-of-plane
square-like hysteresis loop. The strict periodicity of our 2D-MOF allows us to
envision the fabrication of ultra-dense single atom magnetic memories and opens
the way to explore periodic magnetic 2D-models that could considerably increase
the fundamental superparamagnetic limit.

<h3>Effects of leakage on the realization of a discrete time crystal in a  chain of singlet-triplet qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15008" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15008</a>
<br>
<i>Robert E. Throckmorton, S. Das Sarma</i>
<br>
We consider the effects of leakage on the ability to realize a discrete time
crystal (DTC) in a semiconductor quantum dot linear array being operated as a
chain of singlet-triplet (ST) qubits. This system realizes an Ising model with
an effective applied magnetic field, plus additional terms that can cause
leakage out of the computational subspace. We demonstrate that, in the absence
of these leakage terms, this model theoretically realizes a DTC phase over a
broad parameter regime for six and eight qubits, with a broader parameter range
for the eight-qubit case. We then reintroduce the leakage terms and find that
the DTC phase disappears entirely over the same parameter range if the system
is only subject to a uniform magnetic field, which does not suppress leakage.
However, we find that the DTC phase can be restored if the system is instead
subject to a magnetic field that alternates from qubit to qubit, which
suppresses leakage. We thus show that leakage is a serious problem for the
realization of a DTC phase in a chain of ST qubits, but is by no means
insurmountable. Our work suggests that experiments manifesting small-system
stable DTC should be feasible with currently existing quantum dot spin qubits.
