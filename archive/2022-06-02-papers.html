<h3>A one-dimensional three-state run-and-tumble model with a `cell cycle'</h3>

We study a one-dimensional three-state run-and-tumble model motivated by the
bacterium Caulobacter crescentus which displays a cell cycle between a
non-proliferation mobile phase and a proliferating sedentary phase. Our model
implements kinetic transitions between the two mobile and one sedentary states
described in terms of their probability densities, where mobility is allowed
with different activities in forward and backward direction. We start by
analyzing the stationary states of the system and compute the mean squared
displacement, which shows a surprising super-ballistic scaling at early times.
Including interactions between the three states, we explore the stability of
the system and then employ numerical methods to study structure formation in
the fully nonlinear system. We find traveling waves of bacteria, whose
occurrence is quantified in a non-equilibrium state diagram.
