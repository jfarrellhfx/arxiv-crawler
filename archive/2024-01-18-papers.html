<h3>Spinodal decomposition and phase separation in polar active matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09461</a>

<i>Maxx Miller, John Toner</i>
<p>We develop and study the hydrodynamic theory of flocking with autochemotaxis.
This describes large collections of self-propelled entities all spontaneously
moving in the same direction, each emitting a substance which attracts the
others (e.g., ants). The theory combines features of the Keller-Segel model for
autochemotaxis with the Toner-Tu theory of flocking. We find that sufficiently
strong autochemotaxis leads to an instability of the uniformly moving state
(the ``flock"), in which bands of different density form moving parallel to the
mean flock velocity with different speeds. These bands, which are reminiscent
of ant trails, coarsen over time to reach a phase-separated state, in which one
high density and one low density band fill the entire system. The same
instability, described by the same hydrodynamic theory, can occur in flocks
phase separating due to any microscopic mechanism (e.g., sufficiently strong
attractive interactions). Although in many ways analogous to equilibrium phase
separation via spinodal decomposition, the two steady state densities here are
determined not by a common tangent construction, as in equilibrium, but by an
uncommon tangent construction very similar to that found for motility induced
phase separation (MIPS) of disordered active particles. Our analytic theory
agrees well with our numerical simulations of our equations of motion.

<h3>Thermodynamically consistent flocking: From discontinous to continuous  transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09901" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09901</a>
<br>
<i>Tal Agranov, Robert L. Jack, Michael E. Cates, Étienne Fodor</i>
<p>We introduce a family of lattice-gas models of flocking, whose
thermodynamically consistent dynamics admits a proper equilibrium limit at
vanishing self-propulsion. These models are amenable to an exact
coarse-graining which allows us to study their hydrodynamic behavior
analytically. We show that the equilibrium limit here belongs to the
universality class of Model C, and that it generically exhibits tricritical
behavior. Self-propulsion has a non-perturbative effect on the phase diagram,
yielding novel phase behaviors depending on the type of aligning interactions.
For aligning interaction that increase monotonically with the density, the
tricritical point diverges to infinite density reproducing the standard
scenario of a discontinuous flocking transition accompanied by traveling bands.
In contrast, for models where the aligning interaction is non-monotonic in
density, the system can exhibit either (the nonequilibrium counterpart of) an
azeotropic point, associated with a continuous flocking transition, or a state
where three phases coexist dynamically.

<h3>Collective behavior of squirmers in thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09913</a>
<br>
<i>Bohan Wu-Zhang, Dmitry A. Fedosov, Gerhard Gompper</i>
<p>Bacteria in biofilms form complex structures and can collectively migrate
within mobile aggregates, which is referred to as swarming. This behavior is
influenced by a combination of various factors, including morphological
characteristics and propulsive forces of swimmers, their volume fraction within
a confined environment, and hydrodynamic and steric interactions between them.
In our study, we employ the squirmer model for microswimmers and the
dissipative particle dynamics method for fluid modeling to investigate the
collective motion of swimmers in thin films. The film thickness permits a free
orientation of non-spherical squirmers, but constraints them to form a
two-layered structure at maximum. Structural and dynamic properties of squirmer
suspensions confined within the slit are analyzed for different volume
fractions of swimmers, motility types (e.g., pusher, neutral squirmer, puller),
and the presence of a rotlet dipolar flow field, which mimics the
counter-rotating flow generated by flagellated bacteria. Different states are
characterized, including a gas-like phase, swarming, and motility-induced phase
separation, as a function of increasing volume fraction. Our study highlights
the importance of an anisotropic swimmer shape, hydrodynamic interactions
between squirmers, and their interaction with the walls for the emergence of
different collective behaviors. Interestingly, the formation of collective
structures may not be symmetric with respect to the two walls. Furthermore, the
presence of a rotlet dipole significantly mitigates differences in the
collective behavior between various swimmer types. These results contribute to
a better understanding of the formation of bacterial biofilms and the emergence
of collective states in confined active matter.

<h3>Polymer patterning by laser-induced multi-point initiation of frontal  polymerization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09430" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09430</a>
<br>
<i>Andrés L. Cook, Mason A. Dearborn, Trevor M. Anderberg, Kavya D. Vaidya, Justin E. Jureller, Aaron P. Esser-Kahn, Allison H. Squires</i>
<p>Frontal polymerization (FP) is an approach for thermosetting plastics at
lower energy cost than an autoclave. The potential to generate simultaneous
propagation of multiple polymerization fronts has been discussed as an exciting
possibility. However, FP initiated at more than two points simultaneously has
not been demonstrated. Multi-point initiation could enable both large scale
material fabrication and unique pattern generation. Here the authors present
laser-patterned photothermal heating as a method for simultaneous initiation of
FP at multiple locations in a 2-D sample. Carbon black particles are mixed into
liquid resin (dicyclopentadiene) to enhance absorption of light from a
Ti:Sapphire laser (800 nm) focused on a sample. The laser is time-shared by
rapid steering among initiation points, generating polymerization using up to
seven simultaneous points of initiation. This process results in the formation
of both symmetric and asymmetric seam patterns resulting from the collision of
fronts. The authors also present and validate a theoretical framework for
predicting the seam patterns formed by front collisions. This framework allows
the design of novel patterns via an inverse solution for determining the
initiation points required to form a desired pattern. Future applications of
this approach could enable rapid, energy-efficient manufacturing of novel
composite-like patterned materials.

<h3>Directional Wetting of Submerged Gas-entrapping Microtextures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09463</a>
<br>
<i>Sankara Narayana Moorthi Arunachalam, Himanshu Mishra</i>
<p>Numerous natural and industrial processes entail the spontaneous entrapment
of gas/air as rough/patterned surfaces are submerged under water. As the
wetting transitions ensue, the gas diffuses into the water leading to the
fully-water-filled state. However, the standard models for wetting do not
account for the microtexture's topography. In other words, it is not clear
whether the lifetime of n cavities arranged in a I-D line or a II-D (circular
or square) lattice would be the same or not as a single 0-D cavity. In
response, we tracked the time-dependent fates of gas pockets trapped in I-D and
II-D lattices and compared them with wetting transitions in commensurate 0-D
cavities. Interestingly, the wetting transitions in the I-D and the II-D arrays
had a directionality such that the gas from the outermost cavities was lost the
first, while the innermost got filled by water the last. In essence,
microtexture's spatial organization afforded shielding to the loss of the gas
from the innermost cavities, which we probed as a function of the
microtexture's pitch, surface density, dimensionality, and hydrostatic
pressure. These findings advance our knowledge of wetting transitions in
microtextures, and inspiring surface textures to protect electronic devices
against liquid ingression.

<h3>Light-matter interaction in 2D materials in weak and strong-coupling  regimes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09470</a>
<br>
<i>Dogyun Ko</i>
<p>This thesis studies light-matter interactions in strong and weak coupling
regimes. In the first part, we study the formation and propagation of
exciton-polariton condensates in different microcavities in the strong coupling
regime. Exciton-polaritons are composite quasiparticles created as a result of
the strong coupling between microcavity photons and quantum well excitons. In
the first part of the thesis, we take a system of exciton-polaritons in a
Kagome lattice and show that an initially localized condensate propagates in a
specific direction in space in the presence of anisotropy in the lattice, and
the initially localized condensate experiences revivals. We also study the
formation of exciton-polariton condensates in two different lowest energy
states at an exciton-polariton microcavity and the transition from the higher
energy state to the ground state under pulsed and continuous wave excitation
conditions by using various pump profiles. In the second part of the thesis, we
study the valley selection rules for the optical transitions from impurity
states to the conduction band in two-dimensional Dirac materials, taking a
monolayer of MoS2 as an example, we focus on the weak light-matter coupling
regime. We find the spectrum of the light absorption coefficients and calculate
the photon-drag electric current density due to the impurity-band transitions.

<h3>Quantum Phase Transitions and Dynamics in Perturbed Flatbands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09485</a>
<br>
<i>Sanghoon Lee</i>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in flatband systems which
exhibit macroscopic degeneracies. These systems offer a valuable mathematical
framework for the extreme sensitivity to perturbations and interactions. This
sensitivity unveils a wide variety of exotic and unconventional physical
phenomena. Moreover, the progress in their experimental realization contributes
to the expanding landscape of exploration in this field. This thesis aims to
summarize all the works throughout the Ph.D. program. Firstly, an in-depth
exploration was conducted on the impact of weak quasiperiodic perturbations on
one-dimensional two-band all-bands-flat lattices. These tight-binding
Hamiltonian are diagonalized through a sequence of local unitary
transformations. By adjusting the quasiperiodic potential parameters, the key
achievement involves finding a critical-to-insulator transition and identifying
fractality edges in the flatband systems with quasiperiodic perturbations.
Next, the investigation delved into the effects of on-site interactions among
hard-core bosons in one- and two-dimensional cross-stitch lattices. One key
finding is that groundstate energy primarily depends on compact localized
states. Moreover, the presence of barriers of compact localized states trap
bosons, leading to the emergence of non-ergodic excitation and Hilbert space
fragmentation. Lastly, a compact localized eigenstate of the one-dimensional
diamond chain using an electric circuit was successfully generated via local
(linear and non-linear) driving. This achievement opens up a versatile circuit
platform for the generation of flatbands and holds promise for potential
applications in the field of quantum information. I hope these collective
efforts have expanded the frontiers of the field and made a meaningful
contribution to the scientific community.

<h3>Reservoir computing with logistic map</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09501</a>
<br>
<i>R. Arun, M. Sathish Aravindh, A. Venkatesan, M. Lakshmanan</i>
<p>Recent studies on reservoir computing essentially involve a high dimensional
dynamical system as the reservoir, which transforms and stores the input as a
higher dimensional state, for temporal and nontemporal data processing. We
demonstrate here a method to predict temporal and nontemporal tasks by
constructing virtual nodes as constituting a reservoir in reservoir computing
using a nonlinear map, namely logistic map, and a simple finite trigonometric
series. We predict three nonlinear systems, namely Lorenz, R\"ossler, and
Hindmarsh-Rose, for temporal tasks and a seventh order polynomial for
nontemporal tasks with great accuracy. Also, the prediction is made in the
presence of noise and found to closely agree with the target. Remarkably, the
logistic map performs well and predicts close to the actual or target values.
The low values of the root mean square error confirm the accuracy of this
method in terms of efficiency. Our approach removes the necessity of continuous
dynamical systems for constructing the reservoir in reservoir computing.
Moreover, the accurate prediction for the three different nonlinear systems
suggests that this method can be considered a general one and can be applied to
predict many systems. Finally, we show that the method also accurately
anticipates the time series for the future (self prediction).

<h3>Polarity switch of PMMA powder transported through a PMMA duct</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09505</a>
<br>
<i>Wenchao Xu, Holger Grosshans</i>
<p>During pneumatic conveying, powder electrifies rapidly due to the high flow
velocities. In our experiments, the particles even charge if the conveying duct
is made of the same material, which might be caused by triboelectrification
between two asymmetric contact surfaces. Surprisingly, we found the airflow
rate to determine the polarity of the overall powder charge. This study
investigates the charging of microscale PMMA particles in turbulent flows
passing through a square PMMA duct. The particles are spherical and
monodisperse. A Faraday at the duct outlet measured the total charge of the
particles. At low flow velocities, the particles charged negatively after
passing through the duct. However, the powder's overall charge switched to a
positive polarity when increasing the flow velocity.

<h3>Universal Vortex Statistics and Stochastic Geometry of Bose-Einstein  Condensation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09525</a>
<br>
<i>Mithun Thudiyangal, Adolfo del Campo</i>
<p>The cooling of a Bose gas in finite time results in the formation of a
Bose-Einstein condensate that is spontaneously proliferated with vortices. We
propose that the vortex spatial statistics is described by a homogeneous
Poisson point process (PPP) with a density dictated by the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism (KZM). We validate this model using numerical simulations of the
two-dimensional stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) for both a
homogeneous and a hard-wall trapped condensate. The KZM scaling of the average
vortex number with the cooling rate is established along with the universal
character of the vortex number distribution. The spatial statistics between
vortices is characterized by analyzing the two-point defect-defect correlation
function, the corresponding spacing distributions, and the random tessellation
of the vortex pattern using the Voronoi cell area statistics. Combining the PPP
description with the KZM, we derive universal theoretical predictions for each
of these quantities and find them in agreement with the SGPE simulations. Our
results establish the universal character of the spatial statistics of
point-like topological defects generated during a continuous phase transition
and the associated stochastic geometry.

<h3>Pressure Tuning of Berry Curvature in CrGeTe$_3$</h3>

<br>
<i>G. Scharf, B. Hen, P. M. Sarte, B. R. Ortiz, G. Kh. Rozenberg, S. D. Wilson, A. Ron</i>
<p>The integrated Berry curvature is a geometric property that has dramatic
implications on material properties. This study investigates the integrated
Berry curvature and other scattering mechanisms through their contribution to
the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$. The Anomalous Hall effect is absent in
the insulating phase of CrGeTe$_3$ and evolves with pressure in a dome-like
fashion as pressure is applied. The dome's edges are characterized by Fermi
surface deformations, manifested as mixed electron and hole transport. We
discuss the possibility that in CrGeTe$_3$ the integrated Berry curvature is
tuned by the application of hydrostatic pressure due to its relation to the
Fermi surface deformations.

<h3>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite  temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548</a>
<br>
<i>Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng</i>
<p>At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a
quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of
the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the
generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a
1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude
$|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln
|G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the
scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the
underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical
meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that
$\gamma(\theta)$ only takes non-zero values at isolated points of $\theta$,
which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we
show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits
a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we
investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the
filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.

<p>The fusion of non-Abelian anyons or topological defects is a fundamental
operation in measurement-only topological quantum computation. In topological
superconductors, this operation amounts to a determination of the shared
fermion parity of Majorana zero modes. As a step towards this, we implement a
single-shot interferometric measurement of fermion parity in an indium
arsenide-aluminum heterostructure with a gate-defined nanowire. The
interferometer is formed by tunnel-coupling the proximitized nanowire to
quantum dots. The nanowire causes a state-dependent shift of these quantum
dots' quantum capacitance of up to 1 fF. Our quantum capacitance measurements
show flux $h/2e$-periodic bimodality with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 in 3.7
$\mu\text{s}$ at optimal flux values. From the time traces of the quantum
capacitance measurements, we extract a dwell time in the two associated states
that is longer than 1 ms at in-plane magnetic fields of approximately 2 T.
These results are consistent with a measurement of the fermion parity encoded
in a pair of Majorana zero modes that are separated by approximately 3 \textmu
m and subjected to a low rate of poisoning by non-equilibrium quasiparticles.
The large capacitance shift and long poisoning time enable a minimum
measurement error probability of $1\%$.

<h3>Finite Temperature Dynamics in 0-Flux and $π$-Flux Quantum Spin Ice:  Self-Consistent Exclusive Boson Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09551</a>
<br>
<i>Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim</i>
<p>Quantum spin ice (QSI) is an emblematic three-dimensional $U(1)$ quantum spin
liquid (QSL) on the pyrochlore lattice that hosts gapless photon-like modes and
spinon excitations. Despite its notable status and the current rise of strong
material candidates Ce$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf)$_2$O$_7$, there are still only a few
analytical approaches to model the low-energy behavior of QSI. These analytical
methods are essential to gain insight into the physical interpretation of
measurements. We here introduce the self-consistent exclusive boson
representation (SCEBR) to model emergent spinon excitations in QSI. By treating
the presence of other emergent charges in an average way, the SCEBR extends the
range of validity of the exclusive boson representation previously introduced
by Hao, Day, and Gingras [Hao, Day, and Gingras, Physical Review B, 90, 214430
(2014)] to numerous cases of physical relevance. We extensively benchmark the
approach and provide detailed analytical expressions for the spinon dispersion,
the Bogoliubov transformation that diagonalizes the system, and the dynamical
spin structure factor for 0- and $\pi$-flux QSI. Finite temperature properties
are further investigated to highlight essential differences between the
thermodynamic behavior of the 0- and $\pi$-flux phases. We notably show that
the SCEBR predicts a reduction of the spinon bandwidth with increasing
temperature, consistent with previous quantum Monte-Carlo results, through
suppression of spinon hopping by thermal occupation. The SCEBR thus provides a
powerful analytical tool to interpret experiments on current and future
candidate material that has several advantages over other widely used methods.

<h3>Exploring Lead Free Mixed Halide Double Perovskites Solar Cell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09584" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09584</a>

<i>Md Yekra Rahman, Dr. Sharif Mohammad Mominuzzaman</i>
<p>The significant surge in energy use and escalating environmental concerns
have sparked worldwide interest towards the study and implementation of solar
cell technology. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered remarkable
attention as an emerging third-generation solar cell technology. This paper
presents an in-depth analysis of lead-free mixed halide double perovskites in
the context of their potential uses in solar cell technology. Through the
previous studies of various mixed halide double perovskite materials as
potential absorber layer materials, it has been observed that
Cs$_2$TiI$_{6-x}$Br$_x$ possesses promising characteristics. In this study,
simulations were conducted using SCAPS-1D software to explore all possible
combinations for x= 0 to 6. The materials for the Hole Transport Layer (HTL)
and Electron Transport Layer (ETL) and absorber layer, along with their optimal
thicknesses, are selected to yield the most promising results in terms of
open-circuit voltage (V$_{oc}$), short-circuit current density (J$_{sc}$), fill
factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency. A novel tolerance factor is
employed to assess structural stability of perovskites.
FTO/Cu$_2$O/Cs$_2$TiI$_5$Br$_1$/WS$_2$ emerges as the best combination in terms
of the efficiency with 19.03% but FTO/Cu$_2$O/Cs$_2$TiI$_2$Br$_4$/WS$_2$ shows
good stability with 13.31% efficiency.

<h3>Suppression of metal-to-insulator transition and stabilization of  superconductivity by pressure in Re3Ge7</h3>

<i>S. Huyan, E. Mun, H. Wang, T. J. Slade, Z. Li, J. Schmidt, R. A. Ribeiro, W. Xie, S. L. Bud'ko, P. C. Canfield</i>
<p>The effect of pressure on the low-temperature states of the Re3Ge7 is
investigated by both electrical and Hall resistance and magnetization
measurements. At ambient pressure, the temperature dependent resistance of
Re3Ge7 behaves quasi-linearly from room temperature down to 60 K, then
undergoes a two-step metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) at temperatures T1 =
59.4 K and T2 = 58.7 K which may be related to a structural phase transition or
occurrence of charge density wave ordering. Upon applying pressure, the
two-step (T1, T2) MIT splits into three steps (T1, T2 and T3) above 1 GPa, and
all traces of MITs are fully suppressed by ~8 GPa. Subsequently, the onset of
bulk superconductivity (SC) occurs between 10.8 and 12.2 GPa and persists to
our highest pressure of 26.8 GPa. At 12.2 GPa the superconducting transition
temperature, Tc, and upper critical field, Hc2 reach the maximum of Tc (onset)
~5.9 K and Hc2 (1.8 K) ~ 14 kOe. Our results not only present the observation
of SC under high pressure in Re3Ge7 but also delineate the interplay between SC
and other competing electronic states by creating a T - p phase diagram for
this potentially topologically nontrivial system Re3Ge7.

<h3>Ultrafast evanescent heat transfer across solid interfaces via  hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride</h3>

<p>The efficiency of phonon-mediated heat transport is limited by the intrinsic
atomistic properties of materials, seemingly providing an upper limit to heat
transfer in materials and across their interfaces. The typical speeds of
conductive transport, which are inherently limited by the chemical bonds and
atomic masses, dictate how quickly heat will move in solids. Given that
phonon-polaritons, or coupled phonon-photon modes, can propagate at speeds
approaching 1 percent of the speed of light - orders of magnitude faster than
transport within a pure diffusive phonon conductor - we demonstrate that
volume-confined, hyperbolic phonon-polariton(HPhP) modes supported by many
biaxial polar crystals can couple energy across solid-solid interfaces at an
order of magnitude higher rates than phonon-phonon conduction alone. Using
pump-probe thermoreflectance with a mid-infrared, tunable, probe pulse with
sub-picosecond resolution, we demonstrate remote and spectrally selective
excitation of the HPhP modes in hexagonal boron nitride in response to
radiative heating from a thermally emitting gold source. Our work demonstrates
a new avenue for interfacial heat transfer based on broadband radiative
coupling from a hot spot in a gold film to hBN HPhPs, independent of the broad
spectral mismatch between the pump(visible) and probe(mid-IR) pulses employed.
This methodology can be used to bypass the intrinsically limiting phonon-phonon
conductive pathway, thus providing an alternative means of heat transfer across
interfaces. Further, our time-resolved measurements of the temperature changes
of the HPhP modes in hBN show that through polaritonic coupling, a material can
transfer heat across and away from an interface at rates orders of magnitude
faster than diffusive phonon speeds intrinsic to the material, thus
demonstrating a pronounced thermal transport enhancement in hBN via
phonon-polariton coupling.

<p>High-pressure studies on elements play an essential role in superconductivity
research, with implications for both fundamental science and applications. Here
we report the experimental discovery of surprisingly low pressure driving a
novel germanium allotrope into a superconducting state in comparison to that
for alpha-Ge. Raman measurements revealed structural phase transitions and
possible electronic topological transitions under pressure up to 58 GPa. Based
on pressure-dependent resistivity measurements, superconductivity was induced
above 2 GPa and the maximum Tc of 6.8 K was observed under 4.6 GPa.
Interestingly, a superconductivity enhancement was discovered during
decompression, indicating the possibility of maintaining pressure-induced
superconductivity at ambient pressure with better superconducting performance.
Density functional theory analysis further suggested that the electronic
structure of Ge (oP32) is sensitive to its detailed geometry and revealed that
disorder in the beta-tin structure leads to a higher Tc in comparison to the

<h3>Dynamics of elongation of nematic tactoids in an electric field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09642</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammadamin Safdari, Roya Zandi, Paul van der Schoot</i>
<p>Nematic tactoids are spindle-shaped droplets of a nematic phase nucleated in
the co-existing isotropic phase. According to equilibrium theory, their
internal structure and shape are controlled by a balance between the elastic
deformation of the director field, induced by the preferred anchoring of that
director field to the interface, and the interfacial free energy. Recent
experiments on tactoids of chitin nanocrystals dispersed in water show that
electrical fields can very strongly elongate tactoids, at least if the tactoids
are sufficiently large in volume. However, this observation contradicts the
predictions of equilibrium theory as well as findings from Monte Carlo
simulations that do not show this kind of extreme elongation to take place at
all. To explain this, we put forward a relaxational model based on the
Oseen-Frank free energy of elastic deformation of a director field coupled to
an anisotropic surface free energy. In our model, we use two reaction
coordinates to describe the director field and the extent of elongation of the
droplets, and evaluate the evolution of both as a function of time following
the switching on of an electric field. Depending on the relative magnitude of
the fundamental relaxation rates associated with the two reaction coordinates,
we find that the aspect ratio of the drops may develop a large and very
long-lived overshoot before eventually relaxing to the much smaller equilibrium
value. In that case, the response of the curvature of the director field lags
behind, explaining the experimental observations. Our theory describes the
experimental data reasonably well.

<h3>Colossal Layer Nernst Effect in Twisted Moiré Layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09661</a>
<br>
<i>Jin-Xin Hu, Chuanchang Zeng, Yugui Yao</i>
<p>Intriguing Nernst effects offer the prospect of engineering micro- and
nano-sized thermoelectric devices, facilitating heat harvesting, energy
conversion, and directional temperature control. In this Letter, we establish a
theoretical analysis of the layer Nernst effect (LNE) in twisted moir\'{e}
layers subjected to a temperature gradient. Our analysis reveals the emergence
of a layer-contrasted Nernst voltage perpendicular to the direction of the
temperature gradient. This phenomenon arises from the trigonal warping of the
Fermi surface and the layer pseudomagnetic field. The Fermi surface's trigonal
warping, breaking intra-valley inversion symmetry, leads to an imbalance
between left and right movers, resulting in a non-vanishing LNE. We validate
our theoretical framework by applying it to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG).
Importantly, our findings indicate that the Nernst coefficient in TBG can reach
values as high as $\mu$A/K, surpassing those of previously known materials by
three orders of magnitude. These results provide a foundation for utilizing TBG
and other twisted moir\'{e} layers as promising platforms to explore layer
caloritronics and develop thermoelectric devices.

<br>
<i>Xueheng Kuang, Pierre A. Pantaleón Peralta, Jose Angel Silva-Guillén, Shengjun Yuan, Francisco Guinea, Zhen Zhan</i>
<p>The discoveries of numerous exciting phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) are stimulating significant investigations on moir\'e structures that
possess a tunable moir\'e potential. Optical response can provide insights into
the electronic structures and transport phenomena of non-twisted and twisted
moir\'e structures. In this article, we review both experimental and
theoretical studies of optical properties such as optical conductivity,
dielectric function, non-linear optical response, and plasmons in moir\'e
structures composed of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and/or
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Firstly, a comprehensive introduction
to the widely employed methodology on optical properties is presented. After,
moir\'e potential induced optical conductivity and plasmons in non-twisted
structures are reviewed, such as single layer graphene-hBN, bilayer
graphene-hBN and graphene-metal moir\'e heterostructures. Next, recent
investigations of twist-angle dependent optical response and plasmons are
addressed in twisted moir\'e structures. Additionally, we discuss how optical
properties and plasmons could contribute to the understanding of the many-body
effects and superconductivity observed in moir\'e structures.

<h3>Chiral ground states of ferroelectric liquid crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09675" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09675</a>
<br>
<i>Priyanka Kumari, Bijaya Basnet, Maxim O. Lavrentovich, Oleg D. Lavrentovich</i>
<p>Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are formed by achiral molecules with
large dipole moments. Its three-dimensional orientational order is universally
described as unidirectionally polar. We demonstrate that the ground state of
ferroelectric nematic unconstrained by externally imposed alignment directions
is chiral, with left- and right-hand twists of polarization. Although the
helicoidal deformations and defect walls separating domains of opposite
handedness increase the elastic energy, the twists reduce the electrostatic
energy and become weaker when the material is doped with ions. The study shows
that the polar orientational order of molecules could trigger chirality in the
soft matter with no chemically induced chiral centers.

<h3>Higher bracket structure of density operators in Weyl fermion systems  and topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09683</a>
<br>
<i>Edwin Langmann, Shinsei Ryu, Ken Shiozaki</i>
<p>We study the algebraic structure of electron density operators in gapless
Weyl fermion systems in $d=3,5,7,\cdots$ spatial dimensions and in topological
insulators (without any protecting symmetry) in $d=4,6,8,\cdots$ spatial
dimensions. These systems are closely related by the celebrated bulk-boundary
correspondence. Specifically, we study the higher bracket -- a generalization
of commutator for more than two operators -- of electron density operators in
these systems. For topological insulators, we show that the higher-bracket
algebraic structure of density operators structurally parallels with the
Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra (the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra), the algebra of
electron density operators projected onto the lowest Landau level in the
quantum Hall effect. By the bulk-boundary correspondence, the bulk
higher-bracket structure mirrors its counterparts at the boundary.
Specifically, we show that the density operators of Weyl fermion systems, once
normal-ordered with respect to the ground state, their higher bracket acquires
a c-number part. This part is an analog of the Schwinger term in the commutator
of the fermion current operators. We further identify this part with a cyclic
cocycle, which is a topological invariant and an element of Connes'
noncommutative geometry.

<br>
<i>Barun Ghosh, Yugo Onishi, Su-Yang Xu, Hsin Lin, Liang Fu, Arun Bansil</i>
<p>Probing ground-state quantum geometry and topology through optical response
is not only of fundamental interest, but it can also offer several practical
advantages. Here, using first-principles calculations on antiferromagnetic
topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin films, we demonstrate how the
generalized optical weight arising from the absorptive part of the optical
conductivity can be used to probe the ground state quantum geometry and
topology. We show that three septuple layers MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ exhibit an enhanced
almost perfect magnetic circular dichroism for a narrow photon energy window in
the infrared region. We calculate the quantum weight in a few septuple layers
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and show that it far exceeds the lower bound provided by the
Chern number. Our results suggest that the well-known optical methods are
powerful tools for probing the ground state quantum geometry and topology.

<h3>Crystal Transformer Based Universal Atomic Embedding for Accurate and  Transferable Prediction of Materials Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09755</a>
<br>
<i>Luozhijie Jin, Zijian Du, Le Shu, Yongfeng Mei, Hao Zhang</i>
<p>In this work, we propose a novel approach to generate universal atomic
embeddings, significantly enhancing the representational and accuracy aspects
of atomic embeddings, which ultimately improves the accuracy of property
prediction. Moreover, we demonstrate the excellent transferability of universal
atomic embeddings across different databases and various property tasks. Our
approach centers on developing the CrystalTransformer model. Unlike traditional
methods, this model does not possess a fundamental graph network architecture
but utilizes the Transformer architecture to extract latent atomic features.
This allows the CrystalTransformer to mitigate the inherent topological
information bias of graph neural networks while maximally preserving the atomic
chemical information, making it more accurate in encoding complex atomic
features and thereby offering a deeper understanding of the atoms in materials.
In our research, we highlight the advantages of CrystalTransformer in
generating universal atomic embeddings through comparisons with current
mainstream graph neural network models. Furthermore, we validate the
effectiveness of universal atomic embeddings in enhancing the accuracy of model
predictions for properties and demonstrate their transferability across
different databases and property tasks through various experiments. As another
key aspect of our study, we discover the strong physical interpretability
implied in universal atomic embeddings through clustering and correlation
analysis, indicating the immense potential of our universal atomic embeddings
as atomic fingerprints.

<h3>Floquet-Engineered Valley-Topotronics in Kekul$é\ $- Y Bond Textured  Graphene Superlattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09762" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09762</a>
<br>
<i>Sushmita Saha, Alestin Mawrie</i>
<p>The exquisite distortion in a Kekul$\'e\ $-Y (Kek-Y) superlattice merges the
two inequivalent Dirac cones (from the $K$- and the $K^\prime$- points) into
the highest symmetric $\Gamma$-point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Here we
report that a circularly polarised light not only opens up a topological gap at
the $\Gamma$-point but also lifts the valley degeneracy at that point. Endowed
with Floquet dynamics and by devising a scheme of high-frequency approximation,
we have proposed that the handedness (left/right) in polarised light offers the
possibility to realise the valley-selective circular dichroism in Kek-Y shaped
graphene superlattice. Also, the non-vanishing Berry curvature and enumeration
of valley resolved Chern number $\mathcal{C}_{K}/\mathcal{C}_{K^\prime}=+1/-1$
enable us to assign two pseudo-spin flavors (up/down) with the two valleys.
Thereby, the above observations confirm the topological transition suggesting
the ease of realising the valley quantum anomalous Hall (VQAH) state within the
photon-dressed Kek-Y. These findings further manifest a non-zero optical valley
polarisation which is maximum at the $\Gamma$-point. Our paper thus proposes an
optically switchable topological valley filter which is desirous in the
evolving landscape of valleytronics.

<h3>Properties of Fractionally Quantized Recurrence Times for Interacting  Spin Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09810" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09810</a>
<br>
<i>Quancheng Liu, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</i>
<p>Recurrence time quantifies the duration required for a physical system to
return to its initial state, playing a pivotal role in understanding the
predictability of complex systems. In quantum systems with subspace
measurements, recurrence times are governed by Anandan-Aharonov phases,
yielding fractionally quantized recurrence times. However, the fractional
quantization phenomenon in interacting quantum systems remains poorly explored.
Here, we address this gap by establishing universal lower and upper bounds for
recurrence times in interacting spins. Notably, we investigate scenarios where
these bounds are approached, shedding light on the speed of quantum processes
under monitoring. In specific cases, our findings reveal that the complex
many-body system can be effectively mapped onto a dynamical system with a
single quasi-particle, leading to the discovery of integer quantized recurrence
times. Our research yields a valuable link between recurrence times and the
number of dark states in the system, thus providing a deeper understanding of
the intricate interplay between quantum recurrence, measurements, and
interaction effects.

<h3>Dynamical heterogeneities of thermal creep in pinned interfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Tom W.J. de Geus, Alberto Rosso, Matthieu Wyart</i>
<p>Disordered systems under applied loading display slow creep flows at finite
temperature, which can lead to the material rupture. Renormalization group
arguments predicted that creep proceeds via thermal avalanches of activated
events. Recently, thermal avalanches were argued to control the dynamics of
liquids near their glass transition. Both theoretical approaches are markedly
different. Here we provide a scaling description that seeks to unify dynamical
heterogeneities in both phenomena, confirm it in simple models of pinned
elastic interfaces, and discuss its experimental implications.

<h3>Enhanced thermal conductance at gold-amorphous silicon interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09869" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09869</a>
<br>
<i>Julien El Hajj, Gilles Ledoux, Samy Merabia</i>
<p>Heat transfer at the interface between two materials is becoming increasingly
important as the size of electronic devices shrinks. Most studies concentrate
on the interfacial thermal conductance between either crystalline-crystalline
or amorphous-amorphous materials. Here, we investigate the interfacial thermal
conductance at crystalline-amorphous interfaces using non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics simulations. Specifically, gold and two different materials, silicon
and silica, in both their crystalline and amorphous structures, have been
considered. The findings reveal that the interfacial thermal conductance
between amorphous structures and gold is found to be $300 \%$ higher as
compared to crystalline structures for both planar and rough interfaces
($\approx$ 152 MW/m$^2$K for gold-amorphous silicon and $\approx$ 56 MW/m$^2$K
for gold-crystalline silicon). This threefold increase could not be captured by
the diffuse mismatch model, neither be explained by phonon localization at the
interface. We relate the increase of interfacial heat transfer to the
enhancement of the interface bonding and the atomic displacements
cross-correlations of low frequency phonons at the crystalline-amorphous
interfaces. This study calls for the systematic experimental determination of
the interfacial thermal conductance between amorphous materials and metals.

<h3>Magic distances for flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09884</a>
<br>
<i>Antonio Palamara, Michele Pisarra, Antonello Sindona</i>
<p>Twisted bilayer graphene is known to host isolated and relatively flat bands
near charge neutrality, when tuned to specific magic angles. Nonetheless, these
rotational misalignments, lying below 1.1 degrees, result in long-period
moir\'e crystals, whose anomalous electronic properties are hardly accessible
to reliable atomistic simulations. Here, we present a map of differently
stacked graphene sheets, at arbitrary rotation angles corresponding to precise
interplanar distances, into an equivalence class represented by magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene. We determine the equivalence relation in the class
within a continuum model, and extend its definition to a tight-binding
approach. Then, we use density functional theory to suggest that the
magic-angle physics may be characterized by costly computational strategies on
a twisted bilayer geometry, with conveniently large stacking angles. Our
results may pave the way for an ab initio characterization of the
unconventional topological phases and related excitations, associated with
currently observed low-energy quasi-flat bands.

<p>We set up and parametrize a Hubbard model for interacting quantum dots in
bilayer graphene and study double dots as the smallest multi-dot system. We
demonstrate the tunability of the spin and valley multiplets, Hubbard
parameters, and effective exchange interaction by electrostatic gate potentials
and the magnetic field. Considering both the long- and short-range Coulomb
interaction, we map out the various spin and valley multiplets and calculate
their energy gaps for different dot sizes and inter-dot separations. For
half-filling and large valley splittings, we derive and parametrize an
effective Heisenberg model for the quantum dot spins.

<h3>Multiple temperatures and melting of a colloidal active crystal</h3>

<br>
<i>Helena Massana-Cid, Claudio Maggi, Nicoletta Gnan, Giacomo Frangipane, Roberto Di Leonardo</i>
<p>Thermal fluctuations constantly and evenly excite all vibrational modes in an
equilibrium crystal. As the temperature rises, these fluctuations promote the
formation of defects and eventually melting. In active solids, the
self-propulsion of "atomic" units provides another source of strong
non-equilibrium fluctuations whose effect on the melting scenario is still
largely unexplored. Here we show that when a colloidal crystal is activated by
a bath of swimming bacteria, solvent temperature and active temperature
cooperate to define dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Our system consists
of repulsive paramagnetic particles confined in two dimensions and immersed in
a bath of light-driven E. coli. The relative balance between fluctuations and
interactions can be adjusted in two ways: by changing the strength of the
magnetic field and by tuning activity with light. When the persistence time of
active fluctuations is short, a single effective temperature controls both the
amplitudes of vibrational modes and the melting transition. For more persistent
active noise, energy equipartition is broken and multiple temperatures emerge,
whereas melting occurs before the Lindemann parameter reaches its equilibrium
critical value. We show that this phenomenology is fully confirmed by numerical
simulations and can be framed within a minimal model of a single active
particle in a periodic potential.

<p>We present an atomically precise technique to create sulfur vacancies and
control their atomic configurations in single-layer MoS$_{2}$. It involves
adsorbed Fe atoms and the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope, which enables
single sulfur removal from the top sulfur layer at the initial position of Fe.
Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we show that the STM tip can also induce
two Jahn-Teller distorted states with reduced orbital symmetry in the sulfur
vacancies. Density functional theory calculations rationalize our experimental
results. Additionally, we provide evidence for molecule-like hybrid orbitals in
artificially created sulfur vacancy dimers, which illustrates the potential of
our technique for the development of extended defect lattices and tailored
electronic band structures.

<h3>Non-integer Floquet Sidebands Spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09933" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09933</a>
<br>
<i>Du-Yi Ou-Yang, Yan-Hua Zhou, Ya Zhang, Xiao-Tong Lu, Hong Chang, Tao Wang, Xue-Feng Zhang</i>
<p>In the quantum system under periodical modulation, the particle can be
excited by absorbing the laser photon with the assistance of integer Floquet
photons, so that the Floquet sidebands appear. Here, we experimentally observe
non-integer Floquet sidebands (NIFBs) emerging between the integer ones while
increasing the strength of the probe laser in the optical lattice clock system.
Then, we propose the Floquet channel interference hypothesis (FCIH) which
surprisingly matches quantitatively well with both experimental and numerical
results. With its help, we found both Rabi and Ramsey spectra are very
sensitive to the initial phase and exhibit additional two symmetries. More
importantly, the height of Ramsey NIFBs is comparable to the integer one at
larger $g/\omega_s$ which indicates an exotic phenomenon beyond the
perturbative description. Our work provides new insight into the spectroscopy
of the Floquet system and has potential application in quantum technology.

<h3>Real-space nonlocal Gilbert damping from exchange torque correlation  applied to bulk ferromagnets and their surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09938" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09938</a>
<br>
<i>Balázs Nagyfalusi, László Szunyogh, Krisztián Palotás</i>
<p>In this work we present an ab initio scheme based on linear response theory
of exchange torque correlation, implemented into the real-space
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) framework to calculate diagonal elements of the
atomic-site-dependent Gilbert damping tensor. The method is first applied to
bcc iron and fcc cobalt bulk systems. Beside reproducing earlier results from
the literature for those bulk magnets, the effect of the lattice compression is
also studied for Fe bulk, and significant changes for the Gilbert damping are
found. Furthermore, (001)-oriented surfaces of Fe and Co are also investigated.
It is found that the on-site Gilbert damping increases in the surface atomic
layer and decreases in the subsurface layer, and approaches the bulk value
moving further inside the magnets. Realistic atomic relaxation of the surface
layers enhances the identified effects. The first-neighbor damping parameters
are extremely sensitive to the surface relaxation. Despite their inhomogeneity
caused by the surface, the transverse Gilbert damping tensor components remain
largely insensitive to the magnetization direction.

<h3>Thermodynamic precision of a chain of motors: the difference between  phase and noise correlation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09952</a>
<br>
<i>Giulio Costantini, Andrea Puglisi</i>
<p>Inspired by recent experiments on fluctuations of the flagellar beating in
sperms and C. reinhardtii, we investigate the precision of phase fluctuations
in a system of nearest-neighbour-coupled molecular motors. We model the system
as a Kuramoto chain of oscillators with coupling constant $k$ and noisy
driving. The precision $p$ is a Fano-factor-like observable which obeys the
Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR), that is an upper bound related to
dissipation. We first consider independent motor noises with diffusivity $D$:
in this case the precision goes as $k/D$, coherently with the behavior of
spatial order. The minimum observed precision is that of the uncoupled
oscillator $p_{unc}$, the maximum observed one is $Np_{unc}$, saturating the
TUR bound. Then we consider driving noises which are spatially correlated, as
it may happen in the presence of some direct coupling between adjacent motors.
Such a spatial correlation in the noise does not reduce evidently the degree of
spatial correlation in the chain, but sensibly reduces the maximum attainable
precision $p$, coherently with experimental observations. The limiting
behaviors of the precision, in the two opposite cases of negligible interaction
and strong interaction, are well reproduced by the precision of the single
chain site $p_{unc}$ and the precision of the center of mass of the chain
$N_{eff} p_{unc}$ with $N_{eff}<N$: both do not depend on the degree of
interaction in the chain, but $N_{eff}$ decreases with the correlation length
of the motor noises.

<h3>Discrete differential geometry-based model for nonlinear analysis of  axisymmetric shells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09954</a>
<br>
<i>Weicheng Huang, Tianzhen Liu, Zhaowei Liu, Peifei Xu, Mingchao Liu, Yuzhen Chen, K. Jimmy Hsia</i>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel one-dimensional (1D) discrete differential
geometry (DDG)-based numerical method for geometrically nonlinear mechanics
analysis (e.g., buckling and snapping) of axisymmetric shell structures. Our
numerical model leverages differential geometry principles to accurately
capture the complex nonlinear deformation patterns exhibited by axisymmetric
shells. By discretizing the axisymmetric shell into interconnected 1D elements
along the meridional direction, the in-plane stretching and out-of-bending
potentials are formulated based on the geometric principles of 1D nodes and
edges under the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, and elastic force vector and
associated Hession matrix required by equations of motion are later derived
based on symbolic calculation. Through extensive validation with available
theoretical solutions and finite element method (FEM) simulations in
literature, our model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the nonlinear
behavior of axisymmetric shells. Importantly, compared to the classical
theoretical model and three-dimensional (3D) FEM simulation, our model is
highly computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale real-time
simulations of nonlinear problems of shell structures such as instability and
snap-through phenomena. Moreover, our framework can easily incorporate complex
loading conditions, e.g., boundary nonlinear contact and multi-physics
actuation, which play an essential role in the use of engineering applications,
such as soft robots and flexible devices. This study demonstrates that the
simplicity and effectiveness of the 1D discrete differential geometry-based
approach render it a powerful tool for engineers and researchers interested in
nonlinear mechanics analysis of axisymmetric shells, with potential
applications in various engineering fields.

<i>Rémi Goerlich, Yael Roichman</i>
<p>We present and characterize a method to accelerate the relaxation of a
Brownian object between two distinct equilibrium states. Instead of relying on
a deterministic time-dependent control parameter, we use stochastic resetting
to guide and accelerate the transient evolution. The protocol is investigated
numerically, and its thermodynamic cost is evaluated with the tools of
stochastic thermodynamics. Remarkably, we show that stochastic resetting
significantly accelerates the relaxation to the final state. This stochastic
protocol exhibits energetic and temporal characteristics that align with the
scales observed in previously investigated deterministic protocols. Moreover,
it expands the spectrum of stationary states that can be manipulated,
incorporating new potential profiles achievable through experimentally viable
protocols.

<i>L. Dinis, J.M.R. Parrondo</i>
<p>Measurement and feedback allows an external agent to extract work from a
system in contact with a single thermal bath. The maximum amount of work that
can be extracted in a single measurement and the corresponding feedback loop is
given by the information acquired via the measurement, a result that manifests
the close relation between information theory and stochastic thermodynamics. In
this paper we show how to reversibly confine a Brownian particle in an optical
tweezer potential and then extract the corresponding increase of the free
energy as work. By repeatedly tracking the position of the particle and
modifying the potential accordingly, we can extract work optimally even with a
high degree of inaccuracy in the measurements.

<i>L. Tomio, A.N. da Silva, S. Sabari, R. Kishor Kumar</i>
<p>Dynamical vortex production and quantum turbulence emerging in periodic
perturbed quasi-two-dimensional (q2D) Bose-Einstein condensates are reported by
considering two distinct time-dependent approaches. In both cases, dynamical
simulations were performed by solving the corresponding 2D mean-field
Gross-Pitaevskii formalism. (i) In the first model, a binary mass-imbalanced
system is slightly perturbed by a stirring time-dependent elliptic external
potential. (ii) In the second model, for single dipolar species confined in q2D
geometry, a circularly moving external Gaussian-shaped obstacle is applied in
the condensate, at a fixed radial position and constant rotational speed,
enough for the production of vortex-antivortex pairs. Within the first case,
vortex patterns are crystalized after enough longer period, whereas in the
second case, the vortex pairs remains interacting dynamically inside the fluid.
In both cases, the characteristic Kolmogorov spectral scaling law for
turbulence can be observed at some short time interval.

from a solution at ambient conditions. The adsorbed ferroelectric nematic

local time correlation functions of interferometric images allow to
characterize the shear profile close to the wall, with a spatial resolution
well below the grain diameter. For increasing shear, we observe a transition in
the system response and the manifestations of anisotropies in the force chains.
The employed technique is of easy implementation and is especially suitable for
the study of stationary processes.

<p>Level statistics is a crucial tool in the exploration of localization
physics. The level spacing distribution of localized states in disordered
systems follows Poisson statistics, and many studies naturally apply it to the
localization induced by quasiperiodic potentials. Taking the Aubry-Andr\'{e}
model as an example, we investigate the level spacing distribution of the
localized phase caused by quasiperiodic potential. We analytically and
numerically calculate its level spacing distribution and find that it does not
adhere to Poisson statistics. Moreover, based on this level statistics, we
derive the ratio of adjacent gaps and find that for a single sample, it is a
$\delta-$function, which is in excellent agreement with numerical studies.
Additionally, unlike disordered systems, in quasiperiodic systems, there are
variations in the level spacing distribution across different regions of the
spectrum, and increasing the size and increasing the sample are non-equivalent.
Our findings carry significant implications for the reevaluation of level
statistics in quasiperiodic systems and a profound understanding of the
distinct effects of quasiperiodic potentials and disorder-induced localization.

<h3>A unified scaling for the optimal path length in disordered lattices</h3>

<i>Daniel Villarrubia-Moreno, Pedro Córdoba-Torres</i>
<p>In recent decades, much attention has been focused on the topic of optimal
paths in weighted networks due to its broad scientific interest and
technological applications. In this work we revisit the problem of the optimal
path between two points and focus on the role of the geometry (size and shape)
of the embedding lattice, which has received very little attention. This role
becomes crucial, for example, in the strong disorder limit, where the mean
length of the optimal path for a fixed end-to-end distance diverges as the
lattice size increases. We propose a unified scaling ansatz for the mean length
of the optimal path in $D-$dimensional disordered lattices. The ansatz is
supported by a comprehensive numerical study of the problem on $2D$ lattices,
yet we also present results in $D=3$. We show that it unifies well-known
results in the strong and weak disorder regimes, including the crossover
behavior, but it also reveals novel scaling scenarios not yet addressed.
Moreover, it provides relevant insights into the origin of the universal
exponents that characterize the scaling of the optimal path in the strong
disorder limit.

<p>We have experimentally demonstrated different operating modes for the front
lenses of the momentum microscopes described in Part I. Measurements at
energies from vacuum UV at a high-harmonic generation (HHG)-based source to the
soft and hard X-ray range at a synchrotron facility validated the results of
theoretical ray-tracing calculations. The key element is a ring electrode
concentric with the extractor electrode, which can tailor the field in the gap.
First, the gap-lens-assisted extractor mode reduces the field strength at the
sample while mitigating image aberrations. This mode gave good results in all
spectral ranges. Secondly, by compensating the field at the sample surface with
a negative voltage at the ring electrode we can operate in zero-field mode,
which is beneficial for operando experiments. Finally, higher negative voltages
establish the repeller mode, which removes all slow electrons below a certain
kinetic energy to eliminate the primary contribution to the space-charge
interaction in pump-probe experiments. The switch from extractor to repeller
mode is associated with a reduction in the k-field-of-view (10-20 % at
hard-X-ray energies, increasing to ~50% at low energies). Real-space imaging
also benefits from the new lens modes as confirmed by ToF-XPEEM imaging with
650 nm resolution.

<h3>Error-in-constitutive-relation (ECR) framework for the characterization  of linear viscoelastic solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10108</a>
<br>
<i>Marc Bonnet, Prasanna Salasiya, Bojan B. Guzina</i>
<p>We develop an error-in-constitutive-relation (ECR) approach toward the
full-field characterization of linear viscoelastic solids described within the
framework of standard generalized materials. To this end, we formulate the
viscoelastic behavior in terms of the (Helmholtz) free energy potential and a
dissipation potential. Assuming the availability of full-field interior
kinematic data, the constitutive mismatch between the kinematic quantities
(strains and internal thermodynamic variables) and their ``stress''
counterparts (Cauchy stress tensor and that of thermodynamic tensions),
commonly referred to as the ECR functional, is established with the aid of
Legendre-Fenchel gap functionals linking the thermodynamic potentials to their
energetic conjugates. We then proceed by introducing the modified ECR (MECR)
functional as a linear combination between its ECR parent and the kinematic
data misfit, computed for a trial set of constitutive parameters. The
affiliated stationarity conditions then yield two coupled evolution problems,
namely (i) the forward evolution problem for the (trial) displacement field
driven by the constitutive mismatch, and (ii) the backward evolution problem
for the adjoint field driven by the data mismatch. This allows us to establish
compact expressions for the MECR functional and its gradient with respect to
the viscoelastic constitutive parameters. For generality, the formulation is
established assuming both time-domain (i.e. transient) and frequency-domain
data. We illustrate the developments in a two-dimensional setting by pursuing
the multi-frequency MECR reconstruction of (i) piecewise-homogeneous standard
linear solid, and (b) smoothly-varying Jeffreys viscoelastic material.

<h3>Time-Dependent Urn Models reproduce the full spectrum of novelties  discovery</h3>

<i>Alessandro Bellina, Giordano De Marzo, Vittorio Loreto</i>
<p>Systems driven by innovation, a pivotal force in human society, present
various intriguing statistical regularities, from the Heaps' law to logarithmic
scaling or somewhat different patterns for the innovation rates. The Urn Model
with Triggering (UMT) has been instrumental in modelling these innovation
dynamics. Yet, a generalisation is needed to capture the richer empirical
phenomenology. Here, we introduce a Time-dependent Urn Model with Triggering
(TUMT), a generalisation of the UMT that crucially integrates time-dependent
parameters for reinforcement and triggering to offer a broader framework for
modelling innovation in non-stationary systems. Through analytical computation
and numerical simulations, we show that the TUMT reconciles various behaviours
observed in a broad spectrum of systems, from patenting activity to the
analysis of gene mutations. We highlight how the TUMT features a "critical"
region where both Heaps' and Zipf's laws coexist, for which we compute the
exponents.

<h3>Interaction of surfactant and protein at the o/w interface and its  effect on colloidal and biological properties of polymeric nanocarriers</h3>

<p>The use of polymer-based surfactants in the double-emulsion (water/oil/water,
W/O/W) solvent-evaporation technique is becoming a widespread strategy for
preparing biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) loaded
with biomolecules of interest in biomedicine, or biotechnology. This approach
enhances the stability of the NPs, reduces their size and recognition by the
mononuclear phagocytic system, and protects the encapsulated biomolecule
against losing biological activity. Different protocols to add the surfactant
during the synthesis lead to different NP colloidal properties and biological
activity.

<h3>Free energy in spin glass models with conventional order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10223</a>
<br>
<i>Hong-Bin Chen</i>
<p>Recently, [arXiv:2302.01361] considered spin glass models with additional
conventional order parameters characterizing single-replica properties. These
parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter used to measure
correlations between replicas. A "min-max" formula for the free energy was
prescribed in [arXiv:2302.01361]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the
setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin
interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the
Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [arXiv:1512.04441], where the
order parameter for self-overlap is already present.
