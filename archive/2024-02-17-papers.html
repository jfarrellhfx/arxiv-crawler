<h3>Melting of a vortex matter Wigner crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09920" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09920</a>

<i>Tyler W. Neely, Guillaume Gauthier, Charles Glasspool, Matthew J. Davis, Matthew T. Reeves</i>
<p>The two-dimensional One-Component Plasma (OCP) is a foundational model of the
statistical mechanics of interacting particles, describing phenomena common to
astrophysics, turbulence, and the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE).
Despite an extensive literature, the phase diagram of the 2D OCP is still a
subject of some controversy. Here we develop a "vortex matter" simulator to
realize the logarithmic-interaction OCP experimentally by exploiting the
topological character of quantized vortices in a thin superfluid layer.
Precision optical-tweezer control of the location of quantized vortices enables
direct preparation of the OCP ground state with or without defects, and heating
from acoustic excitations allows the observation of the melting transition from
the solid Wigner crystal through the liquid phase. We present novel theoretical
analysis that is in quantitative agreement with experimental observations, and
demonstrates how equilibrium states are achieved through the system dynamics.
This allows a precise measurement of the superfluid-thermal cloud mutual
friction and heating coefficients. This platform provides a route towards
solving a number of open problems in systems with long-range interactions. At
equilibrium, it could distinguish between the competing scenarios of grain
boundary melting and KTHNY theory. Dynamical simulators could test the
existence of predicted edge-wave solitons which form a hydrodynamic analogue of
topological edge states in the FQHE.

<h3>Deconfined quantum criticality of nodal $d$-wave superconductivity,  Néel order and charge order on the square lattice at half-filling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502</a>

<i>Maine Christos, Henry Shackleton, Subir Sachdev, Zhu-Xi Luo</i>
<p>We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single
fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each
lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so
that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global
symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of
the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling.
Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an
average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical
electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion
yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge
theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave
superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or
staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions
between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional
deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for
such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a
transition between an insulator with N\'eel order and a $d$-wave superconductor
with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone.

<h3>Intertwined Magnetism and Superconductivity in Isolated Correlated Flat  Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09506</a>
<br>
<i>Xuepeng Wang, J. F. Mendez-Valderrama, Johannes S. Hofmann, Debanjan Chowdhury</i>
<p>Multi-orbital electronic models hosting a non-trivial band-topology in the
regime of strong electronic interactions are an ideal playground for exploring
a host of complex phenomenology. We consider here a sign-problem-free and
time-reversal symmetric model with isolated topological (chern) bands involving
both spin and valley degrees of freedom in the presence of a class of repulsive
electronic interactions. Using a combination of numerically exact quantum Monte
Carlo computations and analytical field-theoretic considerations we analyze the
phase-diagram as a function of the flat-band filling, temperature and relative
interaction strength. The low-energy physics is described in terms of a set of
intertwined orders -- a spin-valley hall (SVH) insulator and a spin-singlet
superconductor (SC). Our low-temperature phase diagram can be understood in
terms of an effective SO(4) pseudo-spin non-linear sigma model. Our work paves
the way for building more refined and minimal models of realistic materials,
including moir\'e systems, to study the universal aspects of competing
insulating phases and superconductivity in the presence of non-trivial
band-topology.

<h3>Dissipation driven phase transition in the non-Hermitian Kondo model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09510</a>
<br>
<i>Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria, Natan Andrei</i>
<p>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems,
such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an
optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile
atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped
at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses.
It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the
non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on
the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo
phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the
unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is
left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found
that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel
$\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened
phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a
generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures
the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which
corresponds to $0<\alpha<\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo
cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which
screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2<\alpha<\pi$. As
$\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be
screened by the localized bound state for $\pi<\alpha<3\pi/2$. When
$\alpha>3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be
screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays
different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$,
resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.

<h3>Inverse Faraday effect in superconductors with potential impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09517" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09517</a>
<br>
<i>Maxim Dzero</i>
<p>I consider a nonlinear response of conventional superconductors contaminated
with potential impurities or imperfections to a circular polarized light. I
focus on dc contributions to the induced current density which describe the
emergence of the static magnetization in a superconductor. This effect is known
as inverse Faraday effect. By employing quasiclassical theory of
superconductivity I derive an expression for the induced static magnetization
as a function of frequency of an external ac field and disorder scattering
rate. The scattering of electrons off potential impurities is taken into
account within the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation. It is
found that the magnitude of the inverse Faraday effect decreases with an
increase in disorder scattering rate. I have also discovered that the value of
the induced magnetization has a characteristic minimum at a frequency which
approximately equals twice the value of the pairing gap in a clean
superconductor and shifts to higher values with an increase in disorder
scattering rate.

<h3>Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and non-invertible symmetry in lattice  models beyond one dimension</h3>

<i>Aswin Parayil Mana, Yabo Li, Hiroki Sukeno, Tzu-Chieh Wei</i>
<p>We give an explicit operator representation (via a sequential circuit and
projection to symmetry subspaces) of Kramers-Wannier duality transformation in
higher-dimensional subsystem symmetric models generalizing the construction in
the 1D transverse-field Ising model. Using the Kramers-Wannier duality
operator, we also construct the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation that maps
subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases to spontaneous subsystem
symmetry breaking phases, where the symmetry group for the former is either
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This generalizes the
recently proposed picture of one-dimensional Kennedy-Tasaki transformation as a
composition of manipulations involving gauging and stacking symmetry-protected
topological phases to higher dimensions.

<h3>Dynamic magnetic phase transition induced by parametric magnon pumping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09521" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09521</a>
<br>
<i>Jun-Yi Shan, Jonathan B. Curtis, Mingyao Guo, Chang Jae Roh, C. R. Rotundu, Young S. Lee, Prineha Narang, Tae Won Noh, Eugene Demler, D. Hsieh</i>
<p>Uncovering pathways to optically drive magnetic order-disorder transitions on
ultrashort timescales can lead to the realization of novel out-of-equilibrium
quantum phenomena. A long-sought pathway is to directly excite a highly
non-thermal energy-momentum distribution of magnons, bypassing both charge and
lattice degrees of freedom. However, this remains elusive owing to the weak
coupling and large momentum mismatch between photons and magnons. Here we
demonstrate strong parametric excitation of magnons across the entire Brillouin
zone of the antiferromagnetic insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$ by periodically
modulating the superexchange interaction with the electric field of light. The
excitation efficiency is greatly enhanced by tuning to the van Hove singularity
in the magnon spectrum, sufficient to transiently collapse the
antiferromagnetic state using a pulsed laser field of 10$^9$ V/m. The order
parameter recovery timescale increases by over 1000 times as a function of
excitation density, reflecting a crossover from high- to low-energy magnon
dominated decay dynamics. This electric-field induced parametric magnon pumping
mechanism is applicable to a broad range of magnetic insulators and opens up
the possibility of dynamically engineering magnon distributions by design.

<h3>Electron Interference as a Probe of Majorana Zero Modes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09525</a>
<br>
<i>Nadav Drechsler, Omri Lesser, Yuval Oreg</i>
<p>Detecting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors remains
challenging, as localized non-topological states can mimic MZM signatures.
Here, we propose electron interferometry by non-local transport measurements as
a definitive probe to distinguish MZMs from non-topological states. We develop
an analytical minimal model showing that interference via two MZMs exhibits a
robust pattern, in contrast to a non-topological system. We then numerically
confirm this using various topological superconductor models. We find that MZMs
are characterized by an interference pattern that is insensitive to various
perturbations, such as electrostatic gate potential, and resilient to disorder.
Our proposed interferometry approach offers an experimentally accessible means
to detect MZMs, probing their underlying nature through a universal response.

<h3>Modelling turbulent flow of superfluid $^4$He past a rough solid wall in  the $T = 0$ limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09562" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09562</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew J Doyle, Andrei I Golov, Paul M Walmsley, Andrew W Baggaley</i>
<p>We present a numerical study, using the vortex filament model, of vortex
tangles in a flow of pure superfluid $^4$He in the $T = 0$ limit through a
channel of width $D = 1$ mm for various applied velocities $V$. The flat
channel walls are assumed to be microscopically rough such that vortices
terminating at the walls are permanently pinned; vortices are liberated from
their pinned ends exclusively through self-reconnection with their images.
Sustained tangles were observed, for a period of 80 s, above the critical
velocity $V_c \sim 0.20$ cm s$^{-1} = 20 \kappa/D$. The coarse-grained velocity
profile was akin to a classical parabolic profile of the laminar Poiseuille
flow, albeit with a non-zero slip velocity $\sim$ 0.20 cm s$^{-1}$ at the
walls. The friction force was found to be proportional to the applied velocity.
The effective kinematic viscosity was $\sim 0.1\kappa$, and effective Reynolds
numbers within $\mathrm{Re'} < 15$. The fraction of the polarized vortex length
varied between zero in the middle of the channel and $\sim$ 60% within the
shear flow regions $\sim D/4$ from the walls. Therefore, we studied a state of
polarized ultraquantum (Vinen) turbulence fuelled at short lengthscales by
vortex reconnections, including those with vortex images due to the relative
motion between the vortex tangle and the pinning rough surface.

<h3>Selective Hydrogenation Promotes Anisotropic Thermoelectric Properties  of TPDH-Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09572" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09572</a>
<br>
<i>Caique Campos de Oliveira, Douglas Soares Galvao, Pedro Alves da Silva Autreto</i>
<p>We have combined DFT calculations with the Boltzmann semiclassical transport
theory to investigate the effect of selective hydrogenation on the
thermoelectric properties of tetra-penta-deca-hexagonal graphene (TPDH-gr), a
recently proposed new 2D carbon allotrope. Our results show that the Seebeck
coefficient is enhanced after hydrogenation. The conductivity along the x
direction is increased almost eight times while being almost suppressed along
the y direction. This behavior can be understood in terms of the electronic
structure changes due to the appearance of a Dirac-like cone after the
selective hydrogenation. Consistent with the literature, the electronic
contribution to thermal conductivity displays the same qualitative behavior as
the conductivity, as expected from the Wiedemann-Franz law. The increase in
thermal conductivity with temperature limits the material's power factor. The
significant increase in the Seebeck coefficient and conductivity increases also
contribute to the thermal conductivity increase. These results show that
hydrogenation is an effective method to improve the TPDH-gr thermoelectric
properties, and this carbon allotrope can be an effective material for
thermoelectric applications.

<h3>Bond ordering in flux phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09577" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09577</a>
<br>
<i>Yifan Liu, Vivek Aji</i>
<p>Contrary to canonical expectations we show that lattice translational
symmetry breaking often accompanies uniformly ordered flux phases. We
demonstrate this phenomena by studying a spinless-fermion model on a square
latttice with nearest-neighbor repulsion. We find an array of flux patterns, as
a function interaction strength and filling factor, that break time-reversal
symmetry but may or may not preserve translational symmetry. A key finding is
that the pattern of flux ordering does not uniquely determine the electronic
properties. As such a class of new phases of matter are introduced that expand
the candidate ground states in many body interacting systems.

<h3>Spin-orbit torque in single-molecule junctions from ab initio</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09610</a>
<br>
<i>María Camarasa-Gómez, Daniel Hernangómez-Pérez, Ferdinand Evers</i>
<p>The use of electric fields applied across magnetic heterojunctions that lack
spatial inversion symmetry has been previously proposed as a non-magnetic mean
of controlling localized magnetic moments through spin-orbit torques (SOT). The
implementation of this concept at the single-molecule level has remained a
challenge, however. Here, we present first-principle calculations of SOT in a
single-molecule junction under bias and beyond linear response. Employing a
self-consistency scheme invoking density functional theory and non-equilibrium
Green's function theory, we compute the current-induced SOT. Responding to this
torque, a localized magnetic moment can tilt. Within the linear regime our
quantitative estimates for the SOT in single-molecule junctions yield values
similar to those known for magnetic interfaces. Our findings contribute to an
improved microscopic understanding of SOT in single molecules.

<h3>Minimal design of the elephant trunk as an active filament</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09625" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09625</a>

<i>Bartosz Kaczmarski, Sophie Leanza, Renee Zhao, Derek E. Moulton, Ellen Kuhl, Alain Goriely</i>
<p>One of the key problems in active materials is the control of shape through
actuation. A fascinating example of such control is the elephant trunk, a long,
muscular, and extremely dexterous organ with multiple vital functions. The
elephant trunk is an object of fascination for biologists, physicists, and
children alike. Its versatility relies on the intricate interplay of multiple
unique physical mechanisms and biological design principles. Here we explore
these principles using the theory of active filaments and build, theoretically,
computationally, and experimentally, a minimal model that explains and
accomplishes some of the spectacular features of the elephant trunk.

<h3>Simple realization of a fragile topological lattice with quasi  flat-bands in a microcavity array</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09665</a>
<br>
<i>Yuhui Wang, Shupeng Xu, Liang Feng, Ritesh Agarwal</i>
<p>Topological flat bands (TFBs) are increasingly recognized as an important
paradigm to study topological effects in the context of strong correlation
physics. As a representative example, recently it has been theoretically
proposed that the topological non-triviality offers a unique contribution to
flat-band superconductivity, which can potentially lead to a higher critical
temperature of superconductivity phase transition. Nevertheless, the
topological effects within flat bands in bosonic systems, specifically in the
context of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), are less explored. It has been
shown theoretically that non-trivial topological and geometric properties will
also have a significant influence in bosonic condensates as well. However,
potential experimental realizations have not been extensively studied yet. In
this work, we introduce a simple photonic lattice from coupled Kagome and
triangular lattices designed based on topological quantum chemistry theory,
which supports topologically nontrivial quasi-flat bands. Besides band
representation analysis, the non-triviality of these quasi-flat bands is also
confirmed by Wilson loop spectra which exhibit winding features. We further
discuss the corresponding experimental realization in a microcavity array for
future study supporting the potential extension to condensed
exciton-polaritons. Notably, we showed that the inevitable in-plane
longitudinal-transverse polarization splitting in optical microcavities will
not hinder the construction of topological quasi-flat bands. This work acts as
an initial step to experimentally explore the physical consequence of
non-trivial topology and quantum geometry in quasi-flat bands in bosonic
systems, offering potential channels for its direct observation.

<h3>A soluble model of a Non-Equilibrium Steady State: the van Kampen  objection and other lessons</h3>

<br>
<i>Anton Kapustin</i>
<p>A simple model of charge transport is provided by a classical particle in a
smooth random potential and a dissipative coupling to the environment in the
form of Markovian noise and friction. The corresponding Non-Equilibrium Steady
State (NESS) can be determined analytically when both the disorder and
dissipation are weak. We use it to illuminate some foundational issues in
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We show that Linear Response Theory has
a nonempty regime of validity only in the presence of a dissipative coupling to
the environment, thereby validating van Kampen's objection. We also show that
the Principle of Minimum Entropy Production does not determine the NESS beyond
linear order in the electric field, while entropy maximization fails to produce
the correct NESS already at linear order.

<h3>Elementary excitations of single-photon emitters in hexagonal Boron  Nitride</h3>

<i>Jonathan Pelliciari, Enrique Mejia, John M. Woods, Yanhong Gu, Jiemin Li, Saroj B. Chand, Shiyu Fan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Valentina Bisogni, Gabriele Grosso</i>
<p>Single-photon emitters serve as building blocks for many emerging concepts in
quantum photonics. The recent identification of bright, tunable, and stable
emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has opened the door to quantum
platforms operating across the infrared to ultraviolet spectrum. While it is
widely acknowledged that defects are responsible for single-photon emitters in
hBN, crucial details regarding their origin, electronic levels, and orbital
involvement remain unknown. Here, we employ a combination of resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy in defective hBN unveiling
an elementary excitation at 285 meV that gives rise to a plethora of harmonics
correlated with single-photon emitters. We discuss the importance of N $\pi^*$
antibonding orbitals in shaping the electronic states of the emitters. The
discovery of the elementary excitations of hBN provides new fundamental
insights into quantum emission in low-dimensional materials, paving the way for
future investigations in other platforms.

<h3>Site-selective cobalt substitution in La-Co co-substituted  magnetoplumbite-type ferrites: $^{59}$Co-NMR and DFT calculation study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09706</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroyuki Nakamura, Hiroto Ohta, Ryuya Kobayashi, Takeshi Waki, Yoshikazu Tabata, Hidekazu Ikeno, Christian Mény</i>
<p>The La-Co co-substituted magnetoplumbite-type (M-type) ferrites
$A$Fe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ ($A$ = Ca, Sr and Ba, ion sizes Ca$^{2+}$ $<$ Sr$^{2+}$
$<$ Ba$^{2+}$) with Co compositions around 0.2 have been subjected to
$^{59}$Co-NMR. The results show that Co occupies the 4f$_1$, 2a and 12k sites,
and that the smaller the $A$ ion, the more Co tends to occupy the 4f$_1$
minority spin site, which is effective in enhancing both uniaxial anisotropy
and magnetisation. First-principles total energy calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) of undoped $A$Fe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ and a supercell ($2
\times 2 \times 1$ of the unit cell) in which 1/96 of Fe$^{3+}$ is replaced by
Co$^{2+}$ were performed to predict the stable structure and Co occupancy
sites. The results show that regardless of $A$, Co is most stable when it
occupies the 4f$_1$ site, followed by the 2a and 12k sites with energy
differences on the order of 100 meV, and Co practically does not occupy the 2b
and 4f$_2$ sites. As the $A$ ion becomes smaller, the energy difference when Co
occupies each Fe site tends to increase, and the Co occupancy of the 4f$_1$
site also increases. The site selectivity of Co can be roughly explained as a
result of the difference in uniaxial strain along the $c$-axis associated with
the difference in $A$. However, the influence of the $A$ ion differs between
the R and S blocks and the local strain also has a secondary effect on the Co
distribution. Based on these results, the guidelines for improving the
performance (anisotropy and magnetisation) of La-Co co-substituted M-type
ferrite magnets with a limited amount of Co can be summarised as follows: It is
effective to select as small $A$ ions as possible and to post-anneal at low
temperature or cool slowly to concentrate Co at the 4f$_1$ site in tetrahedral
coordination.

<h3>Dimension-Dependent Critical Scaling Analysis and Emergent Competing  Interaction Scales in a 2D Van der Waals magnet Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$Te$_{6}$</h3>

<i>P. C. Mahato, Suprotim Saha, Bikash Das, Subhadeep Datta, Rajib Mondal, Sourav Mal, Ashish Garg, Prasenjit Sen, S. S. Banerjee</i>
<p>We investigate thickness-dependent transformation from a paramagnetic to
ferromagnetic phase in Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$Te$_{6}$ (CGT) in bulk and few-layer
flake forms. 2D Ising-like critical transition in bulk CGT occurs at $T_{c}$ =
67 K with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy. Few-layer CGT on hBN/SiO$_{2}$/Si
substrate displays the same $T_{c}$ but also exhibits a new critical transition
at $T^{\prime}_c$ = 14.2 K. Here, critical scaling analysis reveals the
critical exponents differ significantly from those in bulk and do not align
with the known universality classes. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) and
classical calculations indicate competition between magnetocrystalline and
dipolar anisotropy emerges with reduced dimensions. The observed behavior is
due to minor structural distortions in low dimensional CGT, which modify the
balance between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions and dipolar
anisotropy. This triggers a critical crossover at $T^{\prime}_c$. Our study
shows the emergence of a complex interplay of short- and long-range
interactions below $T^{\prime}_c$ as CGT approaches the 2D limit.

<h3>Doping induced multiferroicity and quantum anomalous Hall effect in  $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09770" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09770</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiqiang Tian, Jin-Yang Li, Tao Ouyang, Chao-Fei Liu, Ziran Liu, Si Li, Anlian Pan, Mingxing Chen</i>
<p>In flat-band materials, the strong Coulomb interaction between electrons can
lead to exotic physical phenomena. Recently, $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ thin films
were found to possess ferroelectricity and flat bands. In this work, using
first-principles calculations, we find that for the monolayer, there is a Weyl
point at $\Gamma$ in the flat band, where the inclusion of the spin-orbit
coupling opens a gap. Shifting the Fermi level into the spin-orbit gap gives
rise to nontrivial band topology, which is preserved for the bilayer regardless
of the interlayer polarization couplings. We further calculate the Chern number
and edge states for both the monolayer and bilayer, for which the results
suggest that they become quantum anomalous Hall insulators under appropriate
dopings. Moreover, we find that the doping-induced magnetism for In$_2$Se$_3$
bilayer is strongly dependent on the interlayer polarization coupling.
Therefore, doping the flat bands in In$_2$Se$_3$ bilayer can also yield
multiferroicity, where the magnetism is electrically tunable as the system
transforms between different polarization states. Our study thus reveals that
multiferroicity and nontrivial band topology can be unified into one material
for designing multifunctional electronic devices.

<h3>Chemotactic particles as strong electrolytes: Debye-Hückel  approximation and effective mobility law</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09775" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09775</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre Illien, Ramin Golestanian</i>
<p>We consider a binary mixture of chemically active particles, that produce or
consume solute molecules, and that interact with each other through the
long-range concentrations fields they generate. We analytically calculate the
effective phoretic mobility of these particles when the mixture is submitted to
a constant, external concentration gradient, at leading order in the overall
concentration. Relying on a analogy with the modeling of strong electrolytes,
we show that the effective phoretic mobility decays with the square-root of the
concentration: our result is therefore a nonequilibrium counterpart to the
celebrated Kohlrausch and Debye-H\"uckel-Onsager conductivity laws for
electrolytes, which are extended here to particles with long-range
nonreciprocal interactions. The effective mobility law we derive reveals the
existence of a regime of maximal mobility, and could find applications in the
description of nanoscale transport phenomena in living cells.

affect the electronic and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenide
monolayers. In this first-principles work based on density-functional theory,
we shed light on the interplay among strain, curvature, and electronic
structure of MoSe$_2$ nanowrinkles. We analyze their structural properties
highlighting the effects of coexisting local domains of tensile and compressive
strain in the same system. By contrasting the band structures of the
nanowrinkles against counterparts obtained for flat monolayers subject to the
same amount of strain, we clarify that the specific features of the former,
such as the moderate variation of the band-gap size and its persisting direct
nature, are ruled by curvature rather than strain. The analysis of the
wave-function distribution indicates strain-dependent localization of the
frontier states in the conduction region while in the valence the sensitivity
to strain is much less pronounced. The discussion about transport properties,
based on the inspection of the effective masses, reveals excellent perspectives
for these systems as active components for (opto)electronic devices.

<h3>Variational Density Functional Perturbation Theory for Metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09806</a>
<br>
<i>Xavier Gonze, Samare Rostami, Christian Tantardini</i>
<p>Density functional perturbation theory is a well-established method to study
responses of molecules and solids, especially responses to atomic displacements
or to different perturbing fields (electric, magnetic). Like for density
functional theory, the treatment of metals is delicate, due to the Fermi-Dirac
statistics and electronic bands crossing the Fermi energy. At zero temperature,
there is an abrupt transition from occupied states to unoccupied ones, usually
addressed with smearing schemes. Also, at finite temperature, fractional
occupations are present, and the occupation numbers may vary in response to the
perturbation. The present work establishes the characteristics of density
functional perturbation theory stemming from the underlying variational
principle, in the case of metals. After briefly reviewing variational density
functional theory for metals, the convexity of the entropy function of the
occupation number is analyzed, and, at finite temperature, the benefit of
resmearing the Fermi-Dirac broadening with the Methfessel-Paxton one is
highlighted. Then the variational expressions for the second-order derivative
of the free energy are detailed, exposing the different possible gauge choices.
The influence of the inaccuracies in the unperturbed wavefunctions from the
prior density functional theory calculation is studied. The whole formalism is
implemented in the ABINIT software package.

<h3>Space-resolved dynamic light scattering within a millimetric drop: from  Brownian diffusion to the swelling of hydrogel beads</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09875" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09875</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo Milani, Ty Phou, Guillame Prevot, Laurence Ramos, Luca Cipelletti</i>
<p>We present a novel dynamic light scattering setup to probe, with time and
space resolution, the microscopic dynamics of soft matter systems confined
within millimeter-sized spherical drops. By using an ad-hoc optical layout, we
tackle the challenges raised by refraction effects due to the unconventional
shape of the samples. We first validate the setup by investigating the dynamics
of a suspension of Brownian particles. The dynamics measured at different
positions in the drop, and hence different scattering angles, are found to be
in excellent agreement with those obtained for the same sample in a
conventional light scattering setup. We then demonstrate the setup capabilities
by investigating a bead made of a polymer hydrogel undergoing swelling. The gel
microscopic dynamics exhibit a space dependence that strongly varies with time
elapsed since the beginning of swelling. Initially, the dynamics in the
periphery of the bead are much faster than in the core, indicative of
non-uniform swelling. As the swelling proceeds, the dynamics slow down and
become more spatially homogeneous. By comparing the experimental results to
numerical and analytical calculations for the dynamics of a homogeneous, purely
elastic sphere undergoing swelling, we establish that the mean square
displacement of the gel strands deviates from the affine motion inferred from
the macroscopic deformation, evolving from fast diffusive-like dynamics at the
onset of swelling to slower, yet supradiffusive, rearrangements at later
stages.

<h3>Explaining all-optical switching in ferrimagnets with heavy rare-earth  elements by varying the spin-flip scattering probability of Gd in  Co$_x$Gd$_{100-x}$ alloys and Co/Gd bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09878</a>
<br>
<i>Julian Hintermayr, Bert Koopmans</i>
<p>Using the microscopic three temperature model, we simulate single-pulse
all-optical switching (AOS) in alloys and bilayers consisting of Co and Gd. In
particular, we investigate its dependence on the spin-flip probability of Gd
$a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$, a material parameter describing the strength of spin-phonon
coupling. We do so to elucidate the mechanisms behind all-optical switching in
systems where Co is coupled to heavy rare-earth elements with higher damping
such as Tb. In alloys, our observations are twofold. First, an increase of
$a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ leads to a broadening of the range of compositions for which
AOS is observed. Second, the ideal Co content is decreased as
$a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ is varied. For bilayers, our analysis indicates that
switching is most efficient when $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ takes on small values.
Conversely, increasing the value of $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ leads to a general
suppression of AOS. Comparing alloys to bilayers, we find that AOS in alloys
exhibits greater resilience to variations in $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ than it does in
bilayers.

<h3>Success and breakdown of Tanner's law for drops of dense granular  suspensions</h3>

<i>Alice Pelosse, Élisabeth Guazzelli, Matthieu Roché</i>
<p>The spreading of viscous drops of density-matched suspensions on a solid
surface is experimentally investigated at the global drop scale. The spreading
dynamics still obeys Tanner's law provided one uses an effective viscosity
which happens to be smaller than the bulk viscosity of the suspension. When the
height of the drop is of the order of the particle size, Tanner's law breaks
down as the particles start to freeze and the pure fluid drains out of the
solid matrix.

<h3>Conformally invariant free parafermionic quantum chains with multispin  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09936" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09936</a>
<br>
<i>Francisco C. Alcaraz, Lucas M. Ramos</i>
<p>We calculated the spectral properties of two related families of
non-Hermitian free-particle quantum chains with $N$-multispin interactions
($N=2,3,\ldots$). The first family have a $Z(N)$ symmetry and are described by
free parafermions. The second one has a $U(1)$ symmetry and are generalizations
of $XX$ quantum chains described by free fermions. The eigenspectra of both
free-particle families are formed by the combination of the same
pseudo-energies. The models have a multicritical point with dynamical critical
exponent $z=1$. The finite-size behavior of their eigenspectra, as well as the
entanglement properties of their ground state wave function, indicate the
models are conformally invariant. The models with open and periodic boundary
conditions show quite distinct physics due to their non-Hermiticity. The models
defined with open boundaries have a single conformal invariant phase while the
$XX$ multispin models show multiple phases with distinct conformal central
charges in the periodic case. The critical exponents of the models are
calculated for $N=3,4,5$ and $6$.

<h3>Pinching Dynamics of Thin Films of Binary Mixtures</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Choudhury, L. Duchemin, F. Lequeux, L. Talini</i>
<p>In binary mixtures, the lifetimes of surface bubbles can be five orders of
magnitude longer than those in pure liquids because of slightly different
compositions of the bulk and the surfaces, leading to a thickness-dependent
surface tension of thin films. Taking profit of the resulting simple surface
rheology, we derive the equations describing the thickness, flow velocity and
surface tension of a single liquid film. Numerical resolution shows that, after
a first step of tension equilibration, a parabolic flow with mobile interfaces
is associated with film pinching in a further drainage step. Our model paves
the way for a better understanding of the rupture dynamics of liquid films.

<p>Perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy combined with $ab-initio$
electronic structure calculations is used to unravel the structural phase
transition path from the low-temperature polar structure to the
high-temperature structural phase in $Ca_3Ti_2O_7$, a hybrid improper
ferroelectric. This procedure explores the unique features of a local probe
environment approach by monitoring the evolution of the electric field gradient
tensor at the calcium sites. The local environments, observed above 1057 K,
confirm a structural phase transition from the $A2_1am$ symmetry to an
orthorhombic $Acaa$ symmetry in the $Ca_3Ti_2O_7$ crystal lattice, disagreeing
with the frequently reported avalanche structural transition from the polar
$A2_1am$ phase to the aristotype $I4/mmm$ phase. Moreover, the EFG temperature
dependency, within the $A2_1am$ temperature stability, is shown to be sensitive
to the recently proposed $Ca_3Ti_2O_7$ ferroelectric polarization decrease
within the 500-800~K temperature range.

<h3>What can we learn from nonequilibrium response of a strange metal?</h3>

<br>
<i>B.A. Polyak, V.S. Khrapai, E.S. Tikhonov</i>
<p>We critically address the recent experiment [Science 382, 907 (2023)] on
nonequilibrium transport and noise in a strange metal YbRh2Si2 patterned into
the nanowire shape. In the long device, resistivity, differential resistance
and current noise data seem to be consistent allowing us to extract
electron-phonon coupling and the temperature dependence of electron-phonon
scattering length. The obtained values can be reconciled with the experimental
data for the short device only assuming the significant contact resistance. We
discuss its possible origin as due to the current redistribution between
YbRh2Si2 and its gold covering, and reveal that this redistribution contact
resistance should be proportional to the YbRh2Si2 resistivity. We also discuss
some subtleties of the noise measurements. Overall, neglecting electron-phonon
energy relaxation even in the shortest devices is arguable so that the observed
shot noise suppression can hardly be attributed to the failure of quasiparticle
concept.

<h3>Optimal design of fast topological pumping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09958</a>
<br>
<i>Xianggui Ding, Zongliang Du, Jiachen Luo, Hui Chen, Zhenqun Guan, Xu Guo</i>
<p>Utilizing synthetic dimensions generated by spatial or temporal modulation,
topological pumping enables the exploration of higher-dimensional topological
phenomena through lower-dimensional physical systems. In this letter, we
propose a rational design paradigm of fast topological pumping based on 1D and
2D time-modulated discrete elastic lattices for the first time. Firstly, the
realization of topological pumping is ensured by introducing quantitative
indicators to drive a transition of the edge or corner state in the lattice
spectrum. Meanwhile, with the help of limiting speed for adiabaticity to
calculate the modulation time, a mathematical formulation of designing
topological pumping with the fastest modulation speed is presented. By applying
the proposed design paradigm, topological edge-bulk-edge and corner-bulk-corner
energy transport are successfully achieved, with 11.2 and 4.0 times of
improvement in modulation speed compared to classical pumping systems in the
literature. In addition, applying to 1D and 2D space-modulated systems, the
optimized modulation schemes can reduce the number of stacks to 5.3% and 26.8%
of the classical systems while ensuring highly concentrated energy transport.
This design paradigm is expected to be extended to the rational design of fast
topological pumping in other physical fields.

<p>Gadolinium stand as the favored choice among magnetic refrigerant materials
for numerous active magnetic regenerator (AMR) prototypes due to its remarkable
ability to exhibit a substantial change in magnetic entropy. This unique
characteristic arises from its status as one of the elemental ferromagnets with
a high Curie temperature, closely aligning with room temperature conditions,
and undergoing a second-order magnetic phase transition. In this comprehensive
study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the
structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of both Gadolinium bulk and
film configurations. Our primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of
the intricate physics underlying the intriguing magnetocaloric features
observed in Gadolinium. This investigation provides valuable insights into the
potential applications and the broader implications of Gadolinium in the realm
of magnetic refrigeration technology.

<h3>Testing the Instanton Approach to the Large Amplification Limit of a  Diffraction-Amplification Problem</h3>

<br>
<i>Philippe Mounaix</i>
<p>The validity of the instanton analysis approach is tested numerically in the
case of the diffraction-amplification problem $\partial_z\psi
-\frac{i}{2m}\nabla_{\perp}^2 \psi =g\vert S\vert^2\, \psi$ for $\ln U\gg 1$,
where $U=\vert\psi(0,L)\vert^2$. Here, $S(x,z)$ is a complex Gaussian random
field, $z$ and $x$ respectively are the axial and transverse coordinates, with
$0\le z\le L$, and both $m\ne 0$ and $g>0$ are real parameters. To sample the
rare and extreme amplification values of interest ($\ln U\gg 1$), we devise a
specific biased sampling procedure by which $p(U)$, the probability
distribution of $U$, is obtained down to values less than $10^{-2270}$ in the
far right tail. We find that the agreement of our numerical results with the
instanton analysis predictions in Mounaix (2023 {\it J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.}
{\bf 56} 305001) is remarkable. Both the predicted algebraic tail of $p(U)$ and
concentration of the realizations of $S$ onto the leading instanton are clearly
confirmed, which validates the instanton analysis numerically in the large $\ln
U$ limit.

<h3>Effect of crystallographic twins on the elastoplastic response of  polycrystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Lucas Monteiro Fernandes, Philipp Rieder, Matthias Neumann, Aude Mulard, Henry Proudhon, Volker Schmidt, François Willot</i>
<p>We investigate the influence of crystallographic twins on the elastoplastic
response of $\gamma$-TiAl intermetallics via full-field FFT-based computations.
We first introduce a hierarchical stochastic model, which is used to simulate
synthetic polycrystalline microstructures containing twin grains with certain
morphologies, and apply it to generate representative volume elements. Second,
we develop a Fourier-based method with regularization for solving the effective
and local mechanical response of polycrystalline media using the
M\'eric-Cailletaud crystal plasticity constitutive law. Numerical results show
that, across configurations of twinning, the corresponding average effective
response is similar. Although differences were quantified, the effect of twins
on the yield stress is negligible in practice (less than $1\%$).

<h3>Exploring 2D Materials by High Pressure Synthesis: hBN, Mg-hBN, b-P,  b-AsP, and GeAs</h3>

<br>
<i>N.D. Zhigadlo</i>
<p>In materials science, selecting the right synthesis technique for specific
compounds is one of the most important steps. High-pressure conditions have a
significant effect on the crystal growth processes, leading to the creation of
unique structures and properties that usually are not possible under normal
conditions. The prime objective of this article is to illustrate the benefits
of using high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) technique when developing
two-dimensional (2D) materials. We could successfully grow bulk single crystals
of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and magnesium doped hexagonal boron nitride
(Mg-hBN) from Mg-B-N solvent. Further exploration of the Mg-B-N system could
lead to the crystallization of isotopically 10B and 11B enriched hBN crystals,
and other doped variants of it. Black phosphorus (b-P) and black phosphorus
doped with arsenic (b-AsP) were obtained by directly converting its elements
into melt and subsequently crystallizing them under HPHT. Germanium arsenide
(GeAs) bulk single crystals were also obtained from the melt at a pressure of 1
GPa. Upon crystallization, all these compounds exhibit the anticipated layered
structures, which makes them easy to exfoliate into 2D flakes, thus providing
opportunities to modify their electrical behavior and create new useful
devices.

<i>Nika Kralj, Miha Ravnik, Žiga Kos</i>
<p>Various active materials exhibit strong spatio-temporal variability of their
orientational order known as active turbulence, characterised by irregular and
chaotic motion of topological defects, including colloidal suspensions,
biofilaments, and bacterial colonies. Here, we present a numerical study of
three-dimensional (3D) active nematic turbulence, examining the influence of
main material constants: (i) the flow-alignment viscosity, (ii) the magnitude
and anisotropy of elastic deformation modes (elastic constants), and (iii) the
chirality. Specifically, this main parameter space covers contractile or
extensile, flow-aligning or flow tumbling, chiral or achiral elastically
anisotropic active nematic fluids. The results are presented using time- and
space-averaged fields of defect density and mean square velocity. The results
also discuss defect density and mean square velocity as possible effective
order parameters in chiral active nematics, distinguishing two chiral nematic
states -- active nematic blue phase and chiral active turbulence. This research
contributes to the understanding of active turbulence, providing a numerical
main phase space parameter sweep to help guide future experimental design and
use of active materials.

<p>Topological defects are inherently stable structures that manifest in a
variety of physical settings, from particle physics and cosmology to
superfluids and quantum magnets. The geometric structure of Bloch wave
functions in a periodic lattice may host topological defects, underpinning the
unique properties of topological quantum matter. While pointlike defects, the
celebrated Weyl points, have been extensively studied, higher dimensional
structures have proven to be harder to pin down. Here, we report the
experimental discovery of orbital vortex lines - the first imaging of
non-trivial quantum-phase winding at line nodes - in the three-dimensional band
structure of a topological semimetal, TaAs. Leveraging dichroic photoemission
tomography, we directly image the winding of atomic orbital angular momentum,
thereby revealing - and determining the location of - lines of vorticity in
full 3D momentum space. We determine the core of the orbital angular momentum
vortex to host a so-called almost movable, two-fold spin-degenerate Weyl nodal
line, a topological feature predicted to occur in certain non-symmorphic
crystals. These results establish the capacity to detect complex topological
textures in reciprocal space and may pave the way toward novel orbital
transport phenomena in metallic quantum materials.

<h3>Gaining insight into molecular tunnel junctions with a pocket calculator  without I-V data fitting. Five-thirds protocol</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10037</a>
<br>
<i>Ioan Baldea</i>
<p>The proposed protocol is an attempt to meet the experimentalists' legitimate
desire of reliably and easily extracting microscopic parameters from
current-voltage measurements on molecular junctions. It applies to junctions
wherein charge transport dominated by a single level (molecular orbital, MO)
occurs via off-resonant tunneling. The recipe is simple. The measured
current-voltage curve $I = I(V)$ should be recast as a curve of $V^{5/3}/I$
versus $V$. This curve exhibits two maxima: one at positive bias ($V =
V_{p+}$), another at negative bias ($V = V_{p-}$). The values $V_{p +} > 0$ and
$V_{p -} < 0$ at the two peaks of the curve for $V^{5/3}/I$ at positive and
negative bias and the corresponding values $I_{p +} = I(V_{p+}) > 0$ and $I_{p
-} = I(V_{p-}) < 0$ of the current is all information needed as input. The
arithmetic average of $V_{p +}$ and $\vert V_{p -}\vert$ in volt provides the
value in electronvolt of the MO energy offset $\varepsilon_0 = E_{MO} - E_F$
relative to the electrode Fermi level ($\vert \varepsilon_0\vert = e (V_{p +} +
\vert V_{p -}\vert )/2$). The value of the (Stark) strength of the bias-driven
MO shift is obtained as $\gamma = (4/5) (V_{p +} - \vert V_{p -} \vert) / (V_{p
+} + \vert V_{p -} \vert) $. Even the low-bias conductance estimate, $ G =
(3/8) (I_{p +} / V_{p +} + I_{p -} / V_{p -})$, can be a preferable alternative
to that deduced from fitting the $I$-$V$ slope in situations of noisy curves at
low bias. To demonstrate the reliability and the generality of this
``five-thirds'' protocol, I illustrate its wide applicability for molecular
tunnel junctions fabricated using metallic and nonmetallic electrodes,
molecular species possessing localized $\sigma$ and delocalized $\pi$
electrons, and} various techniques (mechanically controlled break junctions,
STM break junctions, conducting probe AFM junctions, and large area junctions).

<p>We elucidated the core structure of screw dislocations in ordered B2 FeCo
using a recent magnetic bond-order potential (BOP) [Egorov et al., Phys. Rev.
Mater. 7, 044403 (2023)]. We corroborated that dislocations in B2 FeCo exist in
pairs separated by antiphase boundaries. The equilibrium separation is about 50
A, which demands large-scale atomistic simulations - inaccessible for density
functional theory but attainable with BOP. We performed atomistic simulations
of these separated dislocations with BOP and predicted that they reside in
degenerate core structures. Also, dislocations induce changes in the local
electronic structure and magnetic moments.

<p>We establish the criterion for the phase coexistence in a mixture of
nonreciprocally interacting scalar densities. For an arbitrary number of
components the active pressure exists for a specific class of interactions, and
when the free energy receives no contribution from cross couplings between
spatial gradients of two different species. In this case, the pressure can be
used to determine phase equilibrium, i.e. to construct binodals, and the active
mixture can be mapped to a passive system with an effective free energy. For
general interfacial tension, the pressure changes discontinuously across a flat
interface which assumes the form of an active Laplace pressure in two
dimensions.

<i>Stephanie M. Ribet, Georgios Varnavides, Cassio C.S. Pedroso, Bruce E. Cohen, Peter Ercius, Mary C. Scott, Colin Ophus</i>
<p>In photon upconverting core-shell nanoparticles, structure strongly dictates
performance. Conventional imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy
has sufficient resolution to probe the atomic structure of these nanoparticles,
but contrast, dose, and projection limitations make conventional imaging modes
insufficient for fully characterizing these structures. Phase retrieval methods
provide a promising alternative imaging mode, and in particular, multislice
electron ptychography can recover depth-dependent information. Here, we study
beam-sensitive photon upconverting core-shell nanoparticles with a multislice
ptychography approach using a low electron dose to avoid damage. Large strain
fields arise in these heterostructures due to the mismatch in lattice parameter
between the core and the shell. We reconstruct both a nanoparticle that appears
defect-free and one that has a large break in the side and map the distribution
of strain in 3D by computing distortion fields from high-resolution potential
images of each slice. In the defect-free nanoparticle, we observe twisting of
the shell, while in the broken nanoparticle we measure the 3D position of the
crack, the core, and dislocations. These results highlight the advantage of
multislice electron ptychography to recover 3D information from a single scan,
even under strict electron dose requirements from beam-sensitive samples.

<p>Kagome metals gain attention as they manifest a spectrum of quantum
phenomena, including superconductivity, charge order, frustrated magnetism, and
intertwined correlated states of condensed matter. With regard to electronic
band structure, several of the them exhibit non-trivial topological
characteristics. Here, we present a thorough investigation on the growth and
the physical properties of single crystals of Ni3In2S2 which is established to
be a Dirac nodal line Kagome metal. Extensive characterization is attained
through temperature and field-dependent resistivity, angle-dependent
magnetoresistance and specific heat measurements. In most metals, the Fermi
liquid behaviour is mostly restricted to a narrow range of temperature. In
Ni3In2S2, this characteristic feature has been observed for an extensive
temperature range of 82 K. This is attributed to the strong electron-electron
correlation in the material. Specific heat measurements reveal a high
Kadowaki-Woods ratio which is in good agreement with strongly correlated
systems. Almost linear positive magnetoresistance follows the conventional
Kohler scaling which depicts the applicability of semi-classical theories. The
angle-dependent magneto-resistance been explained using the Voigt-Thomson
formula. Furthermore, de-Haas van Alphen oscillations are observed in
magnetization vs. magnetic field measurement which shed light on the
topological features in the Shandite Ni3In2S2.

<h3>The role of Fock-space correlations in many-body localization</h3>

<i>Thibault Scoquart, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin</i>
<p>Models of many-body localization (MBL) can be represented as tight-binding
models in the many-body Hilbert space (Fock space). We explore the role of
correlations between matrix elements of the effective Fock-space Hamiltonians
in the scaling of MBL critical disorder $W_c(n)$ with the size $n$ of the
system. For this purpose, we consider five models, which all have the same
distributions of diagonal (energy) and off-diagonal ("hopping") Fock-space
matrix elements but different Fock-space correlations. These include
quantum-dot (QD) and one-dimensional (1D) MBL models, their modifications (uQD
and u1D models) with removed correlations of off-diagonal matrix elements, as
well a quantum random energy model (QREM) with no correlations at all. Our
numerical results are in full consistency with analytical arguments predicting
$n^{3/4} (\ln n)^{-1/4} \lesssim W_c \lesssim n \ln n$ for the scaling of
$W_c(n)$ in the QD model (we find $W_c \sim n$ numerically), $W_c(n) \sim
\text{const.}$ for the 1D model, $W_c \sim n \ln n$ for the uQD and u1D models
without off-diagonal correlations, and $W_c \sim n^{1/2} \ln n$ for QREM. The
key difference between the QD and 1D models is in the structure of correlations
of many-body energies. Removing off-diagonal Fock-space correlations makes both
these models "maximally chaotic". Our findings demonstrate that the scaling of
$W_c(n)$ for MBL transitions is governed by a combined effect of Fock-space
correlations of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements.

<p>The ubiquitous domain wall kinetics under magnetic field or current
application describes the dynamic properties in nanostructured magnets.
However, when the geometrical size of a nanomagnetic system is constricted to
the limiting domain wall length scale, the competing energetics between
anisotropy, exchange and dipolar interactions can cause emergent kinetics due
to quasiparticle relaxation, similar to bulk magnets of atomic origin. Here, we
present a joint experimental and theoretical study to support this argument --
constricted nanomagnets, made of antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic neodymium
thin film with honeycomb motif, reveal fast kinetic events at ps time scales
due to the relaxation of chiral vortex loop-shaped topological quasiparticles
that persist to low temperature in the absence of any external stimuli. Such
phenomena are typically found in macroscopic magnetic materials. Our discovery
is especially important considering the fact that paramagnets or
antiferromagnets have no net magnetization. Yet, the kinetics in neodymium
nanostructures is quantitatively similar to that found in ferromagnetic
counterparts and only varies with the thickness of the specimen. This suggests
that a universal, topological quasiparticle mediated dynamical behavior can be
prevalent in nanoscopic magnets, irrespective of the nature of underlying
magnetic material.

<p>Semiflexible polymers are widely used as a paradigm for understanding
structural phases in biomolecules including folding of proteins. Here, we
compare bead-spring and bead-stick variants of coarse-grained semiflexible
polymer models that cover the whole range from flexible to stiff by conducting
extensive replica-exchange Monte Carlo computer simulations. In the data
analysis we focus on knotted conformations whose stability is shown to depend
on the ratio $r_b/r_{\rm min}$ with $r_b$ denoting the equilibrium bond length
and $r_{\rm min}$ the distance of the strongest nonbonded interactions. For
both models, our results provide evidence that at low temperatures for
$r_b/r_{\rm min}$ outside a small range around unity one always encounters
knots as generic stable phases along with the usual frozen and bent-like
structures. By varying the bending stiffness, we observe rather strong
first-order-like structural transitions between the coexisting phases
characterized by these geometrically different motifs. Through analyses of the
energy distributions close to the transition point, we present exploratory
estimates of the free-energy barriers between the coexisting phases.

<h3>Tracer dynamics in polymer networks: generalized Langevin description</h3>

<p>Tracer diffusion in polymer networks and hydrogels is relevant in biology and
technology, while it also constitutes an interesting model process for the
dynamics of molecules in fluctuating, heterogeneous soft matter. Here, we study
systematically the time-dependent dynamics and (non-Markovian) memory effects
of tracers in polymer networks based on (Markovian) implicit-solvent Langevin
simulations. In particular, we consider spherical tracer solutes at high
dilution in regular, tetrafunctional bead-spring polymer networks, and control
the tracer-network Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions and the polymer density.
Based on the analysis of the memory (friction) kernels, we recover the expected
long-time transport coefficients, and demonstrate how the short-time tracer
dynamics, polymer fluctuations, and the viscoelastic response are interlinked.
Further, we fit the characteristic memory modes of the tracers with damped
harmonic oscillations and identify LJ contributions, bond vibrations, and slow
network relaxations, which enter the kernel with an almost linear scaling with
the LJ attractions. This procedure proposes a reduced functional form for the
tracer memory, allowing for a convenient inter- and extrapolation of the memory
kernels. This leads eventually to highly efficient simulations utilizing the
generalized Langevin equation (GLE), in which the polymer network acts as an
additional thermal bath with tuneable intensity.

<h3>Understanding and tuning magnetism in layered Ising-type antiferromagnet  FePSe3 for potential 2D magnet</h3>

<p>Recent development in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have motivated
the search for new van der Waals magnetic materials, especially Ising-type
magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy. Fe-based MPX3 (M = transition metal, X
= chalcogen) compounds such as FePS3 and FePSe3 both exhibit an Ising-type
magnetic order, but FePSe3 receives much less attention compared to FePS3. This
work focuses on establishing the strategy to engineer magnetic anisotropy and
exchange interactions in this less-explored compound. Through chalcogen and
metal substitutions, the magnetic anisotropy is found to be immune against S
substitution for Se whereas tunable only with heavy Mn substitution for Fe. In
particular, Mn substitution leads to a continuous rotation of magnetic moments
from the out-of-plane direction towards in-plane. Furthermore, the magnetic
ordering temperature displays non-monotonic doping dependence for both
chalcogen and metal substitutions but due to different mechanisms. These
findings provide deeper insight into the Ising-type magnetism in this important
van der Waals material, shedding light on the study of other Ising-type
magnetic systems as well as discovering novel 2D magnets for potential
applications in spintronics.

<h3>Random features and polynomial rules</h3>

<i>Fabián Aguirre-López, Silvio Franz, Mauro Pastore</i>
<p>Random features models play a distinguished role in the theory of deep
learning, describing the behavior of neural networks close to their
infinite-width limit. In this work, we present a thorough analysis of the
generalization performance of random features models for generic supervised
learning problems with Gaussian data. Our approach, built with tools from the
statistical mechanics of disordered systems, maps the random features model to
an equivalent polynomial model, and allows us to plot average generalization
curves as functions of the two main control parameters of the problem: the
number of random features $N$ and the size $P$ of the training set, both
assumed to scale as powers in the input dimension $D$. Our results extend the
case of proportional scaling between $N$, $P$ and $D$. They are in accordance
with rigorous bounds known for certain particular learning tasks and are in
quantitative agreement with numerical experiments performed over many order of
magnitudes of $N$ and $P$. We find good agreement also far from the asymptotic
limits where $D\to \infty$ and at least one between $P/D^K$, $N/D^L$ remains
finite.

<p>We develop the hypothesis that the dynamics of a given system may lead to the
activity being constricted to a subset of space, characterized by a fractal
dimension smaller than the space dimension. We also address how the response
function might be sensitive to this change in dimensionality. We discuss how
this phenomenon is observable in growth processes and near critical points for
systems in equilibrium. In particular, we determine the fractal dimension $d_f$
for the Ising model and validate it via computer simulations for two
dimensions.

<h3>Mirror Chern Bands and Weyl Nodal Loops in Altermagnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniil S. Antonenko, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jorn W. F. Venderbos</i>
<p>The electronic spectra of altermagnets are a fertile ground for non-trivial
topology due to the unique interplay between time-reversal and crystalline
symmetries. This is reflected in the unconventional Zeeman splitting between
bands of opposite spins, which emerges in the absence of spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) and displays nodes along high-symmetry directions. Here, we argue that
even for a small SOC, the direction of the magnetic moments in the
altermagnetic state has a profound impact on the electronic spectrum, enabling
novel topological phenomena to appear. By investigating microscopic models for
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) altermagnets, motivated in part
by rutile materials, we demonstrate the emergence of hitherto unexplored Dirac
crossings between bands of same spin but opposite sublattices. The direction of
the moments determines the fate of these crossings when the SOC is turned on.
We focus on the case of out-of-plane moments, which forbid an anomalous Hall
effect and thus ensure that no weak magnetization is triggered in the
altermagnetic state. In 2D, the SOC gaps out the Dirac crossings, resulting in
mirror Chern bands that enable the quantum spin Hall effect and undergo a
topological transition to trivial bands upon increasing the magnitude of the
magnetic moment. On the other hand, in 3D the crossings persist even in the
presence of SOC, forming Weyl nodal loops protected by mirror symmetry.
Finally, we discuss possible ways to control these effects in altermagnetic
material candidates.

<h3>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted  Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</a>
<br>
<i>Rahul Ghosh, Ipsita Mandal</i>
<p>We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups,
which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals
(mWSMs), considering distinct relative orientations of the electromagnetic
fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The
non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the
vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a
nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the
tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $
\mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ B$ terms is
that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute
to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin and they
dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter
regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that (1) they change the
periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their
dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and
(2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity, when measured with
respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.
