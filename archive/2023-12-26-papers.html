<h3>Probing the local rapidity distribution of a 1D Bose gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15344" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15344</a>
<br>
<i>L. Dubois, G. Thémèze, F. Nogrette, J. Dubail, I. Bouchoule</i>
<p>One-dimensional Bose gases with contact repulsive interactions are
characterized by the presence of infinite-lifetime quasiparticles whose momenta
are called the `rapidities'. Here we develop a probe of the local rapidity
distribution, based on the fact that rapidities are the asymptotic momenta of
the particles after a very long one-dimensional expansion. This is done by
performing an expansion of a selected slice of the gas. As a proof of concept,
we apply this to a cloud at equilibrium in a trap. While for realistic
expansion times the asymptotic regime is barely reached, we show that the
expansion dynamics follows the hydrodynamic scaling such that one can use the
theory of Generalized Hydrodynamics to analyze the expansion. Our data are in
good agreement with the theory.

<h3>The nature of low-temperature spin-freezing in frustrated Kitaev magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16096" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16096</a>
<br>
<i>U. Jena, P. Khuntia</i>
<p>The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and
spin correlations in frustrated Kitaev quantum materials offer an ideal
platform to host myriads of non-trivial quantum states with exotic fractional
excitations. The signature of spin-freezing behavior of these spin-orbit driven
frustrated magnets is characterized by a bifurcation of zero-field-cooled and
field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures much below the
characteristic interaction energy scale. The magnetic-specific heat exhibits a
T^2 dependence below the freezing temperature. The field-independent behavior
of magnetic-specific heat below the freezing temperature implies the presence
of exotic low-energy excitations. The aging and memory effect experiments in
the Kitaev magnets suggest the non-hierarchical free energy distribution, which
differs from the hierarchical organization of conventional spin-freezing.
Furthermore, NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follows a power law behavior
below the spin-freezing temperature suggesting the persistence of
unconventional spin excitation spectra. Herein, we demonstrate that the
observed low-temperature spin-freezing phenomena in a few representative Kitaev
quantum materials can be effectively explained by the Halperin and Saslow (HS)
hydrodynamic modes relevant for non-trivial spin glass materials. The linearly
dispersive HS modes are hypothesized to account for instigating non-abelian
defect propagation, thereby inducing a spin jam state in the low-temperature
regime in frustrated Kitaev magnets. Our investigation reveals that HS modes
capture the essence of unconventional spin-freezing ascribed to topological
origin in two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev magnets decorated on a honeycomb lattice
and its 3D analog hyperhoneycomb that offers a viable ground to extend this
framework to a large class of frustrated quantum materials.

<p>Electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) and near-zero field
magnetoresistance (NZFMR) are techniques that probe defect states at dielectric
interfaces critical for metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) electronic devices such
as the Si/SiO$_2$ MOS field effect transistor (MOSFET). A comprehensive theory,
adapted from the trap-assisted recombination theory of Shockley, Read, and

<h3>PerCNet: Periodic Complete Representation for Crystal Graphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14936" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14936</a>
<br>
<i>Jiao Huang, Qianli Xing, Jinglong Ji, Bo Yang</i>
<p>Crystal material representation is the foundation of crystal material
research. Existing works consider crystal molecules as graph data with
different representation methods and leverage the advantages of techniques in
graph learning. A reasonable crystal representation method should capture the
local and global information. However, existing methods only consider the local
information of crystal molecules by modeling the bond distance and bond angle
of first-order neighbors of atoms, which leads to the issue that different
crystals will have the same representation. To solve this many-to-one issue, we
consider the global information by further considering dihedral angles, which
can guarantee that the proposed representation corresponds one-to-one with the
crystal material. We first propose a periodic complete representation and
calculation algorithm for infinite extended crystal materials. A theoretical
proof for the representation that satisfies the periodic completeness is
provided. Based on the proposed representation, we then propose a network for
predicting crystal material properties, PerCNet, with a specially designed
message passing mechanism. Extensive experiments are conducted on two
real-world material benchmark datasets. The PerCNet achieves the best
performance among baseline methods in terms of MAE. In addition, our results
demonstrate the importance of the periodic scheme and completeness for crystal
representation learning.

<h3>Enhancement of long-wave vibronic interaction and quantum diffusion in  liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14938" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14938</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimir Hizhnyakov, Aleksander Shelkan</i>
<p>The zero-phonon type hoping motion of defects in the solid and liquid phases,
causing quantum diffusion, is considered. It was found that due to the
previously discovered significant enhancement of vibronic interaction with
long-wave acoustic phonons, this motion in liquids can be significantly
amplified compared to the solid phase of the same substance at a close
temperature. Quantum diffusion may be particularly important in superfluid 4He.
This is especially true for vacancies that can move here in the form of vacancy
waves (zero vacancies).

<h3>Surface termination effect of SrTiO3 substrate on ultrathin SrRuO3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14944" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14944</a>
<br>
<i>Huiyu Wang, Zhen Wang, Zeeshan Ali, Enling Wang, Mohammad Saghayezhian, Jiandong Guo, Yimei Zhu, Jing Tao, Jiandi Zhang</i>
<p>A uniform one-unit-cell-high step on the SrTiO3 substrate is a prerequisite
for growing high-quality epitaxial oxide heterostructures. However, it is
inevitable that defects induced by mixed substrate surface termination exist at
the interface, significantly impacting the properties of ultrathin films. In
this study, we microscopically identify the origin for the lateral
inhomogeneity in the growth of ultrathin SrRuO3 films due to the step effects
of SrTiO3(001). By using atomic-resolved scanning transmission electron
microscopy, we observe two distinct types of step propagation along the [011]
and [0-11]crystallographic direction in SrTiO3-SrRuO3 heterostructures,
respectively. In particular, the type-II [0-11] step results in lateral
discontinuity of monolayer SrRuO3 and originates from the SrO-terminated
regions along the TiO2-terminated step edge. Such an induced lateral
discontinuity should be responsible for the distinct electronic and magnetic
properties of monolayer SrRuO3. Our findings underscore the critical importance
of using single termination STO substrate to achieve high-quality termination
selective films and to unveil the intrinsic properties of epitaxial films in
the atomic limit.

<h3>Bachelorthesis: Calculation of the magnetic properties of quarternary  ThMn$_{12}$-type compounds with Zr as a substitution for Nd</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14951" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14951</a>
<br>
<i>Nico Yannik Merkt</i>
<p>This research aims to identify an alternative solution for the
Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B magnet in light of the scarcity of rare earth (RE) resources.
The investigation uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess
the effect of partial substitution of Nd with the transition metal (TM) Zr
within the ThMn$_{12}$ structure, focusing specifically on the
(Zr$_{0.5}$Nd$_{0.5}$)Fe$_{11}$Ti compound. In order to gain a comprehensive
understanding, an investigation of intrinsic and magnetic properties, including
saturation magnetisation ($M_S$), Curie temperature ($T_C$) and magnetic
anisotropy energy (MAE), is carried out on binary to quinary compounds
RFe$_{11-y}$Ti$_{y}$ (R: Nd, Zr and Zr$_{0.5}$Nd$_{0.5}$, y: $0 \leq y \leq 1$)
and (Zr$_{0.5}$Nd$_{0.5}$)Fe$_{10}$CoTi. The substitution of Ti at different
concentrations for thermodynamic stabilisation is studied in ternary and
quaternary compounds RFe$_{12-y}$Ti$_y$ ($0 \leq y \leq 1$). In addition, the
influence of Co on phase stability and intrinsic magnetic properties is studied
in the quinary compound (Zr$_{0.5}$Nd$_{0.5}$)Fe$_{10}$CoTi. Special attention
is given to the treatment of the 4$f$-electrons of Nd and their interaction
with the 3$d$-electrons. Theoretical results are compared with available
experimental data, although the limited availability of data, especially for
Zr-containing compounds, limits the scope of such comparisons. Based on the
literature and the calculations of binary and ternary compounds, the
calculations of quaternary and quinary compounds are encouraged. Promising
magnetic properties of an Nd-lean quaternary compound suitable for engineering
applications have been identified.

<h3>Impersonating a Superconductor: High-Pressure BaCoO$_3$, an Insulating  Ferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14955</a>
<br>
<i>Haozhe Wang, Xianghan Xu, Danrui Ni, David Walker, Jie Li, Robert J. Cava, Weiwei Xie</i>
<p>We report the high-pressure synthesis (6 GPa, 1200 $^{\circ}$C) and ambient
pressure characterization of hexagonal HP-BaCoO$_3$. The material (with the 2H
crystal structure) has a short intrachain Co-Co distance of about 2.07
$\text{\r{A}}$. Our magnetization investigation revealed robust diamagnetic
behavior below approximately 130 K when exposed to weak applied magnetic fields
(10 Oe) and a distinct half-levitation phenomenon below that temperature, such
as is often observed for superconductors. Its field-dependent magnetization
profile, however, unveils the characteristics of ferromagnetism, marked by a
substantial magnetic retentivity of 0.22(1) ${\mu}_B$/Co at a temperature of 2
K. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate that HP-BaCoO$_3$ is a
ferromagnetic insulator, not a superconductor.

<h3>Amine-Modified ZIF-8 for Enhanced CO$_2$ Capture: Synthesis,  Characterization and Performance Evaluation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14974</a>
<br>
<i>Viktorie Neubertova, Vaclav Svorcik, Zdenka Kolska</i>
<p>The urgent need for sustainable and innovative approaches to mitigate the
increasing levels of atmospheric CO$_2$ necessitates the development of
efficient methods for its removal. In this study, we focus on the synthesis and
functionalization of metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 at room temperature to
enhance its capacity for CO$_2$ capture. Specifically, we investigated the
impact of four amino-compounds, namely tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA),
hexadecylamine (HDA), ethanolamine (ELA), and cyclopropylamine (CPA), on the
chemical structure, size, surface area and porosity and CO$_2$ capturing of
ZIF-8 powder. By varying concentrations of the amino-compounds, we examined
their influence on the ZIF-8 properties. These results highlight the potential
of simple synthesis and functionalization techniques for MOFs in enhancing
their CO$_2$ capture capabilities. The findings from this study offer new
opportunities for the development of strategies to mitigate CO$_2$ emissions
using MOFs.

<h3>Enhanced Ferromagnetism in Monolayer Cr2Te3 via Topological Insulator  Coupling</h3>

<p>Exchange-coupled interfaces are pivotal in exploiting two-dimensional (2D)
ferromagnetism. Due to the extraordinary correlations among charge, spin,
orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, layered magnetic transition metal
chalcogenides (TMCs) bode well for exotic topological phenomena. Here we report
the realization of wafer-scale Cr2Te3 down to monolayer (ML) on insulating
SrTiO3(111) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Robust ferromagnetism
emerges in 2D Cr2Te3 ML with a Curie temperature TC = 17 K. Moreover, when
Cr2Te3 is proximitized with topological insulator (TI) (Bi,Sb)2Te3, the
magnetism becomes stronger -- for 1 ML, TC increases to 30 K, while for 2 ML it
boosts from 65 K to 82 K. Our experiments and theory strongly indicate that the
Bloembergen-Rowland interaction is likely a universal aspect of TC enhancement
in TI-coupled magnetic heterostructures. The topological-surface-enhanced
magnetism in 2D TMC enables further exchange coupling physics and quantum
hybrid studies, including paving the way to realize interface-modulated
topological electronics.

<h3>Accelerating Nonequilibrium Green functions simulations: the G1-G2  scheme and beyond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15030</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Bonitz, Jan-Philip Joost, Christopher Makait, Erik Schroedter, Karsten Balzer</i>
<p>The theory of Nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF) has seen a rapid
development over the recent three decades. Applications include diverse
correlated many-body systems in and out of equilibrium. Very good agreement
with experiments and available exact theoretical results could be demonstrated
if the proper selfenergy approximations were used. However, full two-time NEGF
simulations are computationally costly, as they suffer from a cubic scaling of
the computation time with the simulation duration. Recently we have introduced
the G1-G2 scheme that exactly reformulates the Kadanoff-Baym ansatz with
Hartree-Fock propagators (HF-GKBA) into time-local equations, allowing for a
dramatic reduction of the scaling to time-linear scaling [Schluenzen et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{124}, 076601 (2020)]. Remarkably, this scaling is
achieved quickly, and also for high-level selfenergies, including the
nonequilibrium $GW$ and $T$-matrix approximations [Joost et al., Phys. Rev. B
\textbf{101}, 245101 (2020)]. Even the dynamically screened ladder
approximation is now feasible [Joost et al., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{105}, 165155
(2022)], and also applications to electron-boson systems were demonstrated.
Here we present an overview on recent results that were achieved with the
G1--G2 scheme. We discuss problems and open questions and present further ideas
how to overcome the current limitations of the scheme.

<h3>Two-Time Quantum Fluctuations Approach and its Relation to the  Bethe--Salpeter Equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15034</a>
<br>
<i>Erik Schroedter, Michael Bonitz</i>
<p>Correlated quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium are of high
interest in many fields, including correlated solids, ultracold atoms or dense
plasmas. Accurate theoretical description of these systems is challenging both,
conceptionally and with respect to computational resources. We have recently
presented a quantum fluctuations approach which is equivalent to the
nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation [E. Schroedter \textit{et al.}, Cond. Matt.
Phys. \textbf{25}, 23401 (2022)] that promises high accuracy at low
computational cost. In a second publication [E. Schroedter \textit{et al.},
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{108}, 205109 (2023)], this approach was extended to the
two-time exchange-correlation functions and the density response properties.
Here, we analyze the properties of this approach in more detail. We demonstrate
that the method is equivalent to the Bethe--Salpeter equation for the two-time
exchange-correlation function when the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz with
Hartree-Fock propagators is applied.

<h3>Unusual magnetism of the axion-insulator candidate Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15054</a>

<p>Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ is a member of a family of orthorhombic nonsymmorphic
rare-earth intermetallics that combines large localized magnetic moments and
itinerant exchange with a low carrier density and perpendicular glide planes.
This may result in special topological crystalline (wallpaper fermion) or axion
insulating phases. Recent studies of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ single crystals have
revealed colossal negative magnetoresistance and multiple magnetic phase
transitions. Here, we clarify this ordering process using neutron scattering,
resonant elastic X-ray scattering, muon spin-rotation, and magnetometry. The
nonsymmorphic and multisite character of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ results in coplanar
noncollinear magnetic structure with an Ising-like net magnetization along the
$a$ axis. A reordering transition, attributable to competing ferro- and
antiferromagnetic couplings, manifests as the onset of a second commensurate
Fourier component. In the absence of spatially resolved probes, the
experimental evidence for this low-temperature state can be interpreted either
as an unusual double-$q$ structure or in a phase separation scenario. The net
magnetization produces variable anisotropic hysteretic effects which also
couple to charge transport. The implied potential for functional domain physics
and topological transport suggests that this structural family may be a
promising platform to implement concepts of topological antiferromagnetic
spintronics.

<h3>Dynamical Facilitation Governs the Equilibration Dynamics of Glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15069</a>
<br>
<i>Rahul N. Chacko, François P. Landes, Giulio Biroli, Olivier Dauchot, Andrea J. Liu, David R. Reichman</i>
<p>Convincing evidence of domain growth in the heating of ultrastable glasses
suggests that the equilibration dynamics of super-cooled liquids could be
driven by a nucleation and growth mechanism. We investigate this possibility by
simulating the equilibration dynamics of a model glass during both heating and
cooling between poorly and well-annealed states. Though we do observe the
growth of domains during heating, we find that domains are absent during
cooling. This absence is inconsistent with classical nucleation theory. By
comparing the equilibration dynamics of our glass with that of two models with
kinetic constraints, we demonstrate that dynamical facilitation generically
leads to heating driven by domain growth and cooling without domains. Our
results provide strong evidence that dynamical facilitation, not nucleation and
interfacial-tension-driven domain growth, is the driving mechanism for the
equilibration dynamics of glass-formers.

<h3>Engineering Plateau Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall  Multilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Deyi Zhuo, Ling-Jie Zhou, Yi-Fan Zhao, Ruoxi Zhang, Zi-Jie Yan, Annie G. Wang, Moses H. W. Chan, Chao-Xing Liu, Chui-Zhen Chen, Cui-Zu Chang</i>
<p>The plateau phase transition in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators
corresponds to a quantum state wherein a single magnetic domain gives way to
multiple magnetic domains and then re-converges back to a single magnetic
domain. The layer structure of the sample provides an external knob for
adjusting the Chern number C of the QAH insulators. Here, we employ molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers with
an asymmetric layer structure and realize the magnetic field-driven plateau
phase transition between two QAH states with odd Chern number change {\Delta}C.
In multilayer structures with C=+-1 and C=+-2 QAH states, we find two
characteristic power-law behaviors between temperature and the scaling
variables on the magnetic field at transition points. The critical exponents
extracted for the plateau phase transitions with {\Delta}C=1 and {\Delta}C=3 in
QAH insulators are found to be nearly identical, specifically, k1~0.390+-0.021
and k2~0.388+-0.015, respectively. We construct a four-layer Chalker-Coddington
network model to understand the consistent critical exponents for the plateau
phase transitions with {\Delta}C=1 and {\Delta}C=3. This work will motivate
further investigations into the critical behaviors of plateau phase transitions
with different {\Delta}C in QAH insulators and provide new opportunities for
the development of QAH chiral edge current-based electronic and spintronic
devices.

<h3>Frequency-Dependent Superconducting States From the Two-Time Linear  Response Theory: Application To Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15074</a>
<br>
<i>Olivier Gingras, Antoine Georges, Olivier Parcollet</i>
<p>We investigate the possible superconducting instabilities of strongly
correlated electron materials using a generalization of linear response theory
to external pairing fields depending on frequency. We compute a pairing
susceptibility depending on two times, allowing us to capture dynamical pairing
and in particular odd-frequency solutions. We first benchmark this method on
the attractive one-band Hubbard model and then consider the superconductivity
of strontium ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ within single-site dynamical mean-field
theory, hence restricting ourselves to pairing states which are momentum
independent in the orbital basis. The symmetry of the superconducting order
parameter of this material is still debated, and local odd-frequency states
have been proposed to explain some experimental discrepancies. In the
temperature range studied, we find that the leading eigenvectors are
odd-frequency intra-orbital spin-triplet states, while the eigenvectors with
the highest predicted transition temperature correspond to even-frequency
intra-orbital spin-singlet states. The latter include a state with $d$-wave
symmetry when expressed in the band basis.

<h3>FeMnNiAlCr High Entropy Alloys with High-Efficiency Surface Oxide Solar  Absorbers for Concentrating Solar Power Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15076</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoxue Gao, Edwin Jiang, Andrew Pike, Eldred Lee, Margaret Wu, Huan Wang, Sheppard Somers, Weiyang Li, Geoffroy Hautier, Ian Baker, Jifeng Liu</i>
<p>High entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted substantial interest in recent
years. Thus far, most investigations have focused on their applications as
structural materials rather than functional materials. In this paper, we show
that FeMnNiAlCr HEAs can potentially be applied as both a structural and
functional material for high-efficiency concentrated solar thermal power (CSP)
systems working at >700 degrees C. The HEA itself would be used in
high-temperature tubing to carry working fluids, while its surface oxide would
act as a high-efficiency solar thermal absorber. These HEAs have demonstrated
yield strengths 2-3x greater than that of stainless steel at 700 degrees C and
a creep lifetime >800 h at 700 degrees C under a typical CSP tubing mechanical
load of 35 MPa. Their Mn-rich surface oxides maintain a high optical-to-thermal
conversion efficiency of ~87% under 1000x solar concentration for 20 simulated
day-night thermal cycles between 750 degrees C and environmental temperature.
These HEAs have also sustained immersion in unpurified bromide molten salts for
14 days at 750{\deg}C with <2% weight loss, in contrast to 70% weight loss from
a 316 stainless steel reference. The simultaneous achievement of promising
mechanical, optical, and thermochemical properties in this FeMnNiAlCr system
opens the door to new applications of HEAs in solar energy harvesting.

<h3>Origins of complexity in the rheology of Soft Earth suspensions</h3>

<i>Shravan Pradeep, Paulo E. Arratia, Douglas J. Jerolmack</i>
<p>When wet soil becomes fully saturated by intense rainfall, or is shaken by an
earthquake, it may fluidize catastrophically. Sand-rich slurries are treated as
granular suspensions, where failure is related to an unjamming transition and
friction is controlled by particle concentration and pore pressure. Mud flows
are modeled as complex fluids akin to gels, where yielding and shear-thinning
behaviors arise from inter-particle attraction and clustering. Here we show
that the full range of complex flow behaviors previously reported for natural
debris flows - dense slurries of soil and water - can be reproduced with
suspensions made only of water, sand and clay. Going from sand-rich to
clay-rich suspensions, we observe a continuous transition from brittle
(Coulomb-like) to ductile (perfect plastic) yielding that is characterized by
(i) a decrease in the stress drop associated with yielding, (ii) an increase in
the shear-thinning exponent from zero to 1/2, and (iii) a decrease in the
normal force. We propose a general constitutive relation for soil suspensions,
with a particle rearrangement time that is controlled by yield stress. Our
experimental results are supported by models for yielding of idealized
amorphous solids, suggesting that the paradigm of non-equilibrium phase
transitions can help to understand and even predict complex behaviors of Soft
Earth suspensions.

<p>We systematically construct two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) three-state Potts paramagnets with gapless edge modes on a
triangular lattice. First, we study microscopic lattice models for the gapless
edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach,
investigate the finite size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and
the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the
universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal
field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent
symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding symmetry distinguishing
between two SPT phases. As a result, the two topologically nontrivial and the
trivial phases define a general one-dimensional chain supporting a
tricriticality, which we argue supports a gapless SPT order in one dimension.

<p>Magnetic bit writing by short-wave magnons without conversion to the

architectures. Recently, the reversal of nanomagnets by propagating magnons was
demonstrated. However, experiments have not yet explored different wavelengths

tasks. We report on the magnetization reversal of individual 20-nm-thick
Ni81Fe19 (Py) nanostripes integrated onto 113-nm-thick yttrium iron garnet
(YIG). We suppress direct interlayer exchange coupling by an intermediate layer
such as Cu and SiO2. Exciting magnons in YIG with wavelengths {\lambda} down to
148 nm we observe the reversal of the integrated ferromagnets in a small
opposing field of 14 mT. Magnons with a small wavelength of {\lambda} = 195 nm,
i.e., twice the width of the Py nanostripes, induced the reversal at an
unprecedentedly small spin precessional power of about 1 nW after propagating
over 15 {\mu}m in YIG. Considerations based on dynamic dipolar coupling explain
the observed wavelength dependence of magnon-induced reversal efficiency. For
an increased power the stripes reversed in an opposing field of only about 1
mT. Our findings are important for the practical implementation of nonvolatile
storage of broadband magnon signals in YIG by means of bistable nanomagnets
without the need of an appreciable global magnetic field.

<h3>Stable Higher-Order Topological Dirac Semimetals with $\mathbb{Z}_2$  Monopole Charge in Alternating-twisted Multilayer Graphenes and beyond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15131" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15131</a>
<br>
<i>Shifeng Qian, Yongpan Li, Cheng-Cheng Liu</i>
<p>We demonstrate that a class of stable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole charge Dirac
point ($\mathbb{Z}_2$DP) phases can robustly exist in real materials, which
surmounts the understanding: that is, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$DP is unstable and
generally considered to be only the critical point of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nodal
line ($\mathbb{Z}_2$NL) characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole charge (the
second Stiefel-Whitney number $w_2$) with space-time inversion symmetry but no
spin-orbital coupling. For the first time, we explicitly reveal the
higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in the stable $\mathbb{Z}_2$DP phase.
We propose the alternating-twisted multilayer graphene, which can be regarded
as 3D twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), as the first example to realize such
stable $\mathbb{Z}_2$DP phase and show that the Dirac points in the 3D TBG are
essential degenerate at high symmetric points protected by crystal symmetries
and carry a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole charge ($w_2=1$), which results
in higher-order hinge states along the entire Brillouin zone of the $k_z$
direction. By breaking some crystal symmetries or tailoring interlayer coupling
we are able to access $\mathbb{Z}_2$NL phases or other $\mathbb{Z}_2$DP phases
with hinge states of adjustable length. In addition, we present other 3D
materials which host $\mathbb{Z}_2$DPs in the electronic band structures and
phonon spectra. We construct a minimal eight-band tight-binding lattice model
that captures these nontrivial topological characters and furthermore tabulate
all possible space groups to allow the existence of the stable $\mathbb{Z}_2$DP
phases, which will provide direct and strong guidance for the realization of
the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole semimetal phases in electronic materials,
metamaterials and electrical circuits, etc.

<p>We image local superfluid density in single crystals of Pd-intercalated
ErTe$_3$ below the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, well below the
onset temperature, $T_{CDW}$, of (disordered) charge-density-wave order. We
find no detectable inhomogeneities. We observe a rapid increase of the
superfluid density below $T_c$, deviating from the behavior expected in
conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer, and show that the temperature
dependence is qualitatively consistent with a combination of quantum and
thermal phase fluctuations.

<h3>Flat bands without twists: periodic holey graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15165" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15165</a>
<br>
<i>Abdiel de Jesús Espinosa-Champo, Gerardo G. Naumis</i>
<p>\textit{Holey Graphene} (HG) is a widely used graphene material for the
synthesis of high-purity and highly crystalline materials. In this work, we
explore the electronic properties of a periodic distribution of lattice holes,
demonstrating the emergence of flat bands with compact localized states. It is
shown that the holes break the bipartite sublattice and inversion symmetries,
inducing gaps and a nonzero Berry curvature. Moreover, the folding of the Dirac
cones from the hexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ) to the holey superlattice
rectangular BZ of HG with sizes proportional to an integer $n$ times the
graphene's lattice parameter leads to a periodicity in the gap formation such
that $n \equiv 0$ (mod $3$). Meanwhile, it is shown that if $n \equiv \pm 1$
(mod $3$), a gap emerges where Dirac points are folded along the $\Gamma-X$
path. The low-energy hamiltonian for the three central bands is also obtained,
revealing that the system behaves as an effective $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_{3}$
graphene material. Therefore, a simple protocol is presented here that allows
obtaining flat bands at will. Such bands are known to increase
electron-electron correlated effects. This work provides an alternative system,
much easier to build than twisted systems, to obtain highly correlated quantum
phases.

<br>
<i>Sabyasachi Tiwari, Maarten Van de Put, Bart Soree, Christopher Hinkle, William G. Vandenberghe</i>
<p>Using Hubbard U corrected density functional theory calculations, lattice
Monte-Carlo, and spin-Monte-Carlo simulations, we investigate the impact of
dopant clustering on the magnetic properties of WSe2~doped with period four
transition metals. We use manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) as candidate n-type
dopants and vanadium (V) as the candidate p-type dopants, substituting the
tungsten (W) atom in WSe2. Specifically, we determine the strength of the
exchange interaction in the Fe-, Mn-, and V-doped WSe2~ in the presence of
clustering. We show that the clusters of dopants are energetically more stable
than discretely doped systems. Further, we show that in the presence of dopant
clustering, the magnetic exchange interaction significantly reduces because the
magnetic order in clustered WSe2~becomes more itinerant. Finally, we show that
the clustering of the dopant atoms has a detrimental effect on the magnetic
interaction, and to obtain an optimal Curie temperature, it is important to
control the distribution of the dopant atoms.

<h3>Role of Motility and Nutrient Availability in Drying Patterns of Algal  Droplets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15180" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15180</a>
<br>
<i>Anusuya Pal, Anupam Sengupta, Miho Yanagisawa</i>
<p>Sessile drying droplets in various bio-relevant systems, encompassing passive
bio-colloids like DNA, proteins, and blood to active microbes, gain
considerable attention due to intricate interplay among different convective
flows, droplet pinning, mechanical stress, wettability, and the emergence of
distinctive patterns. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, or chlamys, is a versatile
algal model employed in molecular biology research and spanning diverse
biotechnological realms. While chlamys are harnessed at single-cell and
population levels, their exploration in the context of drying sessile droplets
remains limited. This paper illuminates the multifaceted potential of chlamys,
delving into motility-nutrient interactions and their role in emergent
morphological patterns. The interplay of two competing stressors -- localized
nutrient scarcity and mechanical stress during drying -- is investigated.
Irrespective of these stressors, the global mechanical stress fails to induce
any cracks during the drying process. Interestingly, the reverse ``coffee-ring
effect" is predominantly observed in the non-motile chlamys in the presence of
local nutrients whereas the nutrient depletion prompts local stress in motile
chlamys, culminating in cooperative aggregation and cluster formation.
Furthermore, the quantitative image processing technique leverages textural
statistics to classify the patterns into four classes, motile+with nutrients,
motile+without nutrients, non-motile+with nutrients, and non-motile+without
nutrients, with five distinct drying stages -- Droplet Deposition, Capillary
Flow, Dynamic Droplet Phase, Aggregation Phase, and Dried Morphology.

<h3>Comparing machine learning potentials for water: Kernel-based regression  and Behler-Parrinello neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15213</a>
<br>
<i>Pablo Montero de Hijes, Christoph Dellago, Ryosuke Jinnouchi, Bernhard Schmiedmayer, Georg Kresse</i>
<p>In this paper we investigate the performance of different machine learning
potentials (MLPs) in predicting key thermodynamic properties of water using
RPBE+D3. Specifically, we scrutinize kernel-based regression and
high-dimensional neural networks trained on a highly accurate dataset
consisting of about 1,500 structures, as well as a smaller data set, about half
the size, obtained using only on-the-fly learning. The study reveals that
despite minor differences between the MLPs, their agreement on observables such
as the diffusion constant and pair-correlation functions is excellent,
especially for the large training dataset. Variations in the predicted density
isobars, albeit somewhat larger, are also acceptable, particularly given the
errors inherent to approximate density functional theory. Overall, the study
emphasizes the relevance of the database over the fitting method. Finally, the
study underscores the limitations of root mean square errors and the need for
comprehensive testing, advocating the use of multiple MLPs for enhanced
certainty, particularly when simulating complex thermodynamic properties that
may not be fully captured by simpler tests.

<h3>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the presence of non-linear  friction and memory</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Plati, A. Puglisi, A. Sarracino</i>
<p>A new Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR) is derived for systems
described by linearly coupled Langevin equations in the presence of non-linear
frictional forces. In our scheme, the main variable represents the velocity of
a particle, while the other coupled variables describe memory effects which may
arise from strongly correlated degrees of freedom with several time-scales and,
in general, are associated with thermal baths at different temperatures. The
new TUR gives a lower bound for the mean-squared displacement of the position
of the particle, including its asymptotic diffusion coefficient. This bound, in
several examples worked out here, appears to be a good analytical estimate of
the real diffusion coefficient. The new TUR can be also applied in the absence
of any external force (with or without thermal equilibrium between the baths),
a case which usually goes beyond the scope of original TURs. We show
applications to non-linear frictional models with memory, such as the Coulomb
and the Prantdtl-Tomlinson models, usually representative of friction at the
nano-scale and within atomic-force microscopy experiments.

<h3>Geometric frustration and pairing order transition in confined bacterial  vortices</h3>

<br>
<i>Kazus Beppu, Kaito Matsuura, Yusuke T. Maeda</i>
<p>Dense systems of active matter exhibit a highly dynamic collective motion
characterized by intermingled vortices, referred to as active turbulence. The
interaction between these vortices is a key to controlling turbulent dynamics,
and one promising approach to revealing the rules governing their interaction
is through geometric confinement. In this study, we investigate the vortex
pairing patterns in confined bacterial suspensions as a model frustrated system
where a perfect antiferromagnetic state is not allowed. We find that three-body
vortex interactions show anomalous pairing order transition from co-rotational
vortex pairing to the counter-rotating pattern with frustration. Although the
active matter system is non-equilibrium, our theory based on bending energy
accounts for the significant features including pattern transition and the
shift of the transition point in frustrated systems. Moreover, the interplay of
chirality in collective motion and frustration in vortex pairing creates
collective rotational flow in broad geometric conditions of confined space. Our
results illustrate that the use of frustrated vortex patterning promotes a
geometric approach to arranging active turbulence in microfluidic systems.

<h3>Room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors through  metal-semiconductor transition in monolayer MnSe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15259</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Wen Li, Gang Su, Bo Gu</i>
<p>To realize room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors is still a challenge
in spintronics. Recent experiments have obtained two-dimensional (2D) room
temperature ferromagnetic metals, such as monolayer MnSe2. In this paper, we
proposed a way to obtain room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors through
metal-semiconductor transition. By the density functional theory calculations,
a room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor is obtained in monolayer MnSe2
with a few percent tensile strains, where a metal-semiconductor transition
occurs with 2.2% tensile stain. The tensile stains raise the energy of d
orbitals of Mn atoms and p orbitals of Se atoms near the Fermi level, making
the Fermi level sets in the energy gap of bonding and antibonding states of
these p and d orbitals, and opening a small band gap. The room temperature
ferromagnetic semiconductors are also obtained in the heterostructures MnSe2/X
(X = Al2Se3, GaSe, SiH, and GaP), where metal-semiconductor transition happens
due to the tensile strains by interface of heterostructures. In addition, a
large magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is obtained in monolayer MnSe2 with
tensile strain and MnSe2-based heterostructures. Our theoretical results pave a
way to obtain room temperature magnetic semiconductors from experimentally
obtained 2D room temperature ferromagnetic metals through metal-semiconductor
transitions.

<p>We use surface acoustic waves of 1 and 3 GHz in hybrid piezoelectric-magnetic

magnetoacoustic waves and directly image them using stroboscopic X-ray magnetic

amplitudes of both acoustic and magnetic components of the magnetoacoustic
waves, which are generated in the ferromagnetic layer and can propagate over
millimeter distances. Additionally, we quantifiedy the magnetoelastic strain
component for cobalt and nickel through micromagnetic simulations. We obtained
a drop in the magnetoacoustic signal at 3 GHz suggesting a speed limit for the
efficient magnetoelastic coupling in our hybrid devices.

<h3>Energy conversion in thermoelectric materials of SnSSe and SnS$_2$: a  Monte-Carlo simulation of Boltzmann transport equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15331</a>
<br>
<i>Seyedeh Ameneh Bahadori, Zahra Shomali</i>
<p>In the present work, thermal transport and energy conversation in two
thermoelectrically efficient candidates of Janus SnSSe and SnS$_2$ are
investigated within the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of phonon
Boltzmann equation. The phonon analysis is performed to determine the
contributed phonons in heat transport. The results present that the dominant
participating phonons are longitudinal acoustic ones while the least belongs to
the transverse acoustic (TA) mode. Both materials reached the very high maximum
temperature in response to the implied wasted heat. This is attributed to the
low presence of the critical TA phonons. Also, the temperature profile achieved
during the heating and cooling of the materials is studied. It is obtained that
the heat propagation through the SnS$_2$ is, at first, swifter, which results
in a temperature gradient through the whole material which is less than that of
the SnSSe. As the time passes, the heat transfer that is directly related to
the material thermal conductivity, slows down. So, the behavior of the SnS$_2$
and SnSSe, in case of the heat propagation status, becomes similar. More, the
behavior of the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), the efficiency ($\eta$),
and the generated voltage have been figured out. It is stated that the higher
zT and $\eta$ do not guarantee a larger generated Seebeck voltage. This is
true, while the generated Seebeck voltage is related to the temperature
difference between the heated and the cold junction. Accordingly, how far the
temperature of matter rises in response to the implied wasted heat is related
to the obtained voltage. Mainly, it is presented that the maximum temperature
that a material achieves, alongside the temperature gradient and material
property Seebeck coefficient, are essential in introducing thermoelectrically
efficient materials with reasonable thermal to electrical energy conversion.

<p>MoTe2 is a paradigmatic van der Waals layered semimetal with two
energetically close electronic phases, the topologically trivial 1Tprime and
the low-temperature Td type-II Weyl semimetal phase. The ability to manipulate
this phase transition, perhaps towards occurring near room temperature, would
open new avenues for harnessing the full potential of Weyl semimetals for
high-efficiency electronic and spintronic applications. Here, we show that
potassium dosing on 1Tprime-MoTe2 induces a Lifshitz transition by a
combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling
microscopy, x-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory. While the
electronic structure shifts rigidly for small concentrations of K, MoTe2
undergoes significant band structure renormalization for larger concentrations.
Our results demonstrate that the origin of this electronic structure change
stems from alkali metal intercalation. We show that these profound changes are
caused by effectively decoupling the 2D sheets, bringing K-intercalated
1Tprime-MoTe2 to the quasi-2D limit, but do not cause a topological phase
transition.

<p>PtTe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$ are among the first transition metal dichalcogenides
that were predicted to host type-II Dirac fermions, exotic particles prohibited
in free space. These materials are layered and air-stable, which makes them top
candidates for technological applications that take advantage of their
anisotropic magnetotransport properties. Here, we provide a detailed
characterization of the electronic structure of PtTe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$ using
Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy ARPES and Density Functional Theory
DFT calculations, unveiling a new three-dimensional Dirac-like dispersion in
these materials. Through the use of circularly polarized light, we report a
different behavior of such dispersion in PdTe$_2$ compared to PtTe$_2$, that we
relate to our DFT calculations. Additionally, our circular dichroism data shows
a sharp difference between the known type-II Dirac cones and the topologically
protected surface states in these materials. Finally, we present an analysis
that links our experimental and theoretical data to the different symmetries
associated to the crystallographic space group shared by PtTe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$.
Our work provides a useful reference for the ARPES characterization of other
transition metal dichalcogenides with topological properties and illustrates
the use of circular dichroism as an additional tool to differentiate the
topological character of two otherwise equivalent band dispersions and to
identify new dispersions.

<h3>Low defect density GaAs epitaxially grown on Si(001) with ultrathin  buffer by molecular beam epitaxy</h3>

<br>
<i>Kun Cheng, Tianyi Tang, Wenkang Zhan, Zhenyu Sun, Bo Xu, Chao Zhao, Zhanguo Wang</i>
<p>The direct growth of III-V compound materials on complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible silicon (Si) substrates has been a
promising approach to creating large-scale optoelectronic devices and advancing
silicon-based photonics integration. However, III-V compounds have dissimilar
properties, leading to defects in the epitaxial layer, particularly threading
dislocations (TDs), antiphase boundaries (APBs), and thermal cracks. These
defects significantly impact optoelectronic device performance and must be
effectively restricted. The current epitaxy processes cannot simultaneously
suppress the APDs, TDs, and thermal cracks. Therefore, there is a need to
develop a new technique to inhibit the TDs and APDs in a thin buffer on
CMOS-compatible Si. In this paper, we employ a GaSb buffer layer during the
epitaxial growth of a GaAs layer on the Si (001) substrate. This approach aims
to suppress defect formation by inducing the formation of interfacial misfit
dislocation (IMF) arrays at both the AlSb/Si interface and GaSb/GaAs interface.
The structural properties and defects formation mechanism were clarified by
transmission electron microscopy. Then, the GaAs layer with a step-flow
surface, rough mean square about 3.8 nm, and full width at half maximum of 158
arcsec was obtained. Significantly, the growth of the GaAs layer on the GaSb
buffer layer was achieved without any discernible interfacial intermixing.
Building on this platform, InAs/GaAs QDs are grown with a density of around
3.8x1010 cm-2, emitting at a peak wavelength of 1288 nm. This outcome holds
great promise for developing high-quality GaAs films with reduced defect
densities on Si(001) substrates. High-performance optoelectronic devices can be
grown on this film, enabling the mass production of Si-based integrated
circuits.

<br>
<i>Alexandros J. Tsamopoulos, Zhen-Gang Wang</i>
<p>We construct a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model based on poly(ethylene
oxide) and lithium bis-(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide salt to examine the
combined effects of temperature and salt concentration on the transport
properties. Salt doping notably slows down the dynamics of polymer chains and
reduces ion diffusivity, resulting in a glass transition temperature increase
proportional to the salt concentration. The polymer diffusion is shown to be
well represented by a modified Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (M-VFT) equation that
accounts for both the temperature and salt concentration dependence.
Furthermore, we find that at any temperature, the concentration dependence of
the conductivity is well described by the product of its infinite dilution
value and a correction factor accounting for the reduced segmental mobility
with increasing salt concentration. These results highlight the important role
of polymer segmental mobility in the salt concentration dependence of ionic
conductivity for temperatures near and above the glass transition.

<h3>Quantum-criticality in twisted bi-layer graphene</h3>

<i>C. M. Varma</i>
<p>We show that the particular loop-current order for twisted bi-layer graphene
(TBG) at the carbon length-scale together with modulations on the moir\'e
length scale proposed by Blutinck et al. maps to the xy model. Some
experimental evidence in unstrained TBG at various fillings is consistent with
this order at both scales while strained samples appear to show such an order
at the carbon length scale but a kekule order at the moir\'e length scale. We
pay special attention to deriving the coupling of fermions to the fluctuations
of the xy model. The previous solution of the quantum xy model coupled to the
fermions serves three purposes. (1) derivation of the $\omega/T$ scaling of the
propagator of the fluctuations whose coupling to fermions gives the observed
linear in temperature resistivity and other marginal Fermi-liquid properties
which could tested in future experiments. (2) It provides the topological
defects to which an externally applied magnetic field couples to give a
resistivity proportional to $H_z$, and (3) it provides the mechanism for
instability of the quantum fluctuating state to superconductivity in d-wave
symmetry. Further experiments are required to ascertain the assumed symmetries
of the order.

<p>Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) hold a vast potential in various fields such as
spintronics, quantum acoustics, and electron-quantum optics, but an

interdigital transducers (IDTs) to generate SAWs while reducing the

suppressed by more than 90% in all directions. This suppression overcomes the
operating limits and improves the scalability of SAW systems. Our results
promise to facilitate the development of SAW-based applications in a wide range

<p>The observation of the gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) effect in
superconducting nanostructures increased the hopes for realizing a
superconducting equivalent of semiconductor field-effect transistors. However,
recent works attribute this effect to various leakage-based scenarios, giving
rise to a debate on its origin. A proper understanding of the microscopic
process underlying the GCS effect and the relevant time scales would be
beneficial to evaluate the possible applications. In this work, we observed
gate-induced two-level fluctuations between the superconducting state and
normal state in Al/InAs nanowires (NWs). Noise correlation measurements show a
strong correlation with leakage current fluctuations. The time-domain
measurements show that these fluctuations have Poissonian statistics. Our
detailed analysis of the leakage current measurements reveals that it is
consistent with the stress-induced leakage current (SILC), in which inelastic
tunneling with phonon generation is the predominant transport mechanism. Our
findings shed light on the microscopic origin of the GCS effect and give deeper
insight into the switching dynamics of the superconducting NW under the
influence of the strong gate voltage.

<p>Chiral oligopeptide monolayers were adsorbed on a ferromagnetic surface and
their magnetoresistance was measured as a function of the angle between the
magnetization of the ferromagnet and the surface normal. These measurements
were conducted as a function of temperature for both enantiomers. The angle
dependence was found to follow the cosine square function. Quantum simulations
revealed that the angular distribution could be obtained only if the monolayer
has significant effective spin orbit coupling (SOC), that includes contribution
from the vibrations. The model shows that SOC only in the leads cannot
reproduce the observed angular dependence. The simulation can reproduce the
experiments only if it included electron-phonon interactions and dissipation.

electrostatic and van der Waals forces, critical Casimir forces are effective
interactions characterised by the possibility to control reversibly their
strength via minute temperature changes, while their attractive or repulsive
character is conveniently determined via surface treatments or by structuring
the involved surfaces. These features make critical Casimir forces excellent
candidates for controlling the equilibrium and dynamical properties of
individual colloids or colloidal dispersions as well as for possible
applications in micro-mechanical systems. In the past 25 years a number of
theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted to investigate these
forces primarily under thermal equilibrium conditions, while their dynamical
and non-equilibrium behaviour is a largely unexplored subject open for future
investigations.

<h3>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on the percolation cluster: Waiting  time distribution in side-branches</h3>

<i>Chandrashekar Iyer, Mustansir Barma, Deepak Dhar</i>
<p>As the simplest model of interacting-particle transport in a randomly
disordered medium, we consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP)
in which particles with hard-core interactions perform biased random walks, on
the supercritical percolation cluster. In this process, the long time
trajectory of a marked particle consists of steps on the backbone, punctuated
by time spent in side-branches. We study the probability distribution in the
steady state of the waiting time $T_w$ of a randomly chosen particle, in a
side-branch since its last step along the backbone. Exact numerical evaluation
of this on a single side-branch of lengths $L= 1$ to $9$ show that for large
fields, the probability distribution of $\log T_w $ has multiple well separated
peaks. We extend this result to a random comb, and to the ASEP on the
percolation cluster. For the latter problem, we show that in the steady state,
the fractional number of particles that have been in the same side-branch for a
time interval greater than $T_w$ varies as $exp( - c \sqrt{ln T_w})$ for large
$T_w$, where $c$ depends only on the bias field. The system shows dynamical
heterogeneity, with particles segregating into pockets of high and low
mobilities. These long timescales are not reflected in the eigenvalue spectrum
of the Markov evolution matrix.

<br>
<i>Lucas Javier Albornoz, Rebeca Díaz Pardo, Aristide Lemaître, Sebastian Bustingorry, Javier Curiale, Vincent Jeudy</i>
<p>We explore the contributions of adiabatic and non-adiabatic spin-transfer
torques (STT) of a spin-polarized current to the thermally activated creep
motion of domain-walls in a thin (Ga,Mn)(As,P) film with perpendicular
anisotropy. For a domain-wall transverse to current, the non-adiabatic STT is
found to act as an external magnetic field. Close to the compensation between
these two terms, the adiabatic contribution is strongly enhanced. The
domain-wall velocity may be both increased or reduced by the adiabatic STT,
which we associate to variations of creep pinning energy barrier with
domain-wall magnetic texture. Far from compensation, the contribution of
adiabatic STT is negligible. Field and current driven domain-wall motion
present common universal behaviors described by the quenched Edwards Wilkinson
universality class.

<h3>Consequence of anisotropy on flocking: the discretized Vicsek model</h3>

<br>
<i>Mintu Karmakar, Swarnajit Chatterjee, Raja Paul, Heiko Rieger</i>
<p>We numerically study a discretized Vicsek model (DVM) with particles
orienting in $q$ possible orientations in two dimensions. The study probes the
significance of anisotropic orientation and microscopic interaction on the
macroscopic behavior. The DVM is an off-lattice flocking model like the active
clock model [ACM; EPL {\bf 138}, 41001 (2022)] but the dynamical rules of
particle alignment and movement are inspired by the prototypical Vicsek model
(VM). The DVM shows qualitatively similar properties as the ACM for
intermediate noise strength where a transition from macrophase to microphase
separation of the coexistence region is observed as $q$ is increased. But for
small $q$ and noise strength, the liquid phase appearing in the ACM at low
temperatures is replaced in the DVM by a configuration of multiple clusters
with different polarization which does not exhibit any long-range order. We
find that the dynamical rules have a profound influence on the overarching
features of the flocking phase. We further identify the metastability of the
ordered liquid phase subjected to a perturbation.

<h3>Bridging Rokhsar-Kivelson Type and Generic Quantum Phase Transitions via  Thermofield Double States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15530" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15530</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Tao Xu, Rui-Zhen Huang, Guang-Ming Zhang</i>
<p>The formalism of the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) model has been frequently used to
study topological phase transitions in 2D in terms of the deformed
wavefunctions, which are RK-type wavefunctions. A key drawback of the deformed
wavefunctions is that the obtained quantum critical points are RK-type, in the
sense that the equal-time correlation functions are described by 2D conformal
field theories (CFTs). The generic Lorentz invariant quantum critical points
described by (2+1)D CFTs can not be obtained from the deformed wavefunctions.
To address this issue, we generalize the deformed wavefunction approach to the
deformed thermofield double (TFD) state methodology. Through this extension, we
can effectively reconstruct the absent temporal dimension at the RK-type
quantum critical point. We construct deformed TFD states for a (1+1)D quantum
phase transition from a symmetry-protected topological phase to a
symmetry-breaking phase, and for generic (2+1)D topological phase transitions
from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phase to a trivial paramagnetic
phase.

<p>Investigating spin and charge noise in strongly correlated electron systems
is a valuable way to analyze their physical properties and unlock new phases of
matter. In this context, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based magnetometry has
been proven to be a versatile sensor for various classes of magnetic materials
in broad temperature and frequency ranges. Here, we use longitudinal relaxation
time $T_1$ of single NV centers to investigate the spin dynamics of
nanometers-thin flakes of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ at room temperature. We observe a
significant reduction in the $T_1$ in the presence of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in
proximity to our NVs, which we attribute to paramagnetic spin noise confined in
the 2D hexagonal plane. Furthermore, the $T_1$ time exhibits an almost linear
increase with an applied external magnetic field. We associate this trend with
the alteration of spin and charge noise in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under an external
magnetic field. These findings suggest that the influence of the
room-temperature spin dynamics of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ on the longitudinal
relaxation time of the NV center can be used to gain information on the
material itself and the technique to be used on other 2D materials.

<i>Aleix Boquet-Pujadas, Jérôme Hardouïn, Junhao Wen, Jordi Ignés-Mullol, Francesc Sagués</i>
<p>We present a framework to take new measurements in nematic systems that
contain active elements such as molecular motors. Spatio-temporal fields of
stress, velocity, pressure, and forces are obtained jointly from microscopy
images. Our inverse-problem approach ensures that they comply with physical
laws and are accurate near system boundaries. Our measurements in active
biological materials provide new insight for the design of boundary-aware
nematic systems. The shear stress unveils a correlation with the nucleation of
topological defects. The velocity and pressure fields characterize how boundary
effects drive the dynamics of the system in terms of attractors. And the force
relates the underlying fluid with the nematic tensor to reveal the activity
scales of the system. More broadly, our work establishes a generalizable
approach to study experimental systems that are inaccessible to measuring
probes.

<h3>Formation of Mn-rich interfacial phases in Co2FexMn1-xSi thin films</h3>

<i>Ka Ming Law, Arashdeep S. Thind, Mihir Pendharkar, Sahil J. Patel, Joshua J. Phillips, Chris J. Palmstrom, Jaume Gazquez, Albina Borisevich, Rohan Mishra, Adam J. Hauser</i>
<p>We report the formation of Mn-rich regions at the interface of Co2FexMn1-xSi
thin films grown on GaAs substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with electron energy loss (EEL)
spectrum imaging reveals that each interfacial region: (1) is 1-2 nm wide, (2)
occurs irrespective of the Fe/Mn composition ratio and in both Co-rich and
Co-poor films, and (3) displaces both Co and Fe indiscriminately. We also
observe a Mn-depleted region in each film directly above each Mn-rich
interfacial layer, roughly 3 nm in width in the x = 0 and x = 0.3 films, and 1
nm in the x = 0.7 (less Mn) film. We posit that growth energetics favor Mn
diffusion to the interface even when there is no significant Ga interdiffusion
into the epitaxial film. Element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD) measurements show larger Co, Fe, and Mn orbital to spin magnetic moment
ratios compared to bulk values across the Co2FexMn1-xSi compositional range.
The values lie between reported values for pure bulk and nanostructured Co, Fe,
and Mn materials, corroborating the non-uniform, layered nature of the material
on the nanoscale. Finally, SQUID magnetometry demonstrates that the films
deviate from the Slater-Pauling rule for uniform films of both the expected and
the measured composition. The results inform a need for care and increased
scrutiny when forming Mn-based magnetic thin films on III-V semiconductors like
GaAs, particularly when films are on the order of 5 nm or when interface
composition is critical to spin transport or other device applications.

<h3>Relativistic artificial molecules with tunable coupling and orbitals</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiao-Feng Zhou, Yu-Chen Zhuang, Mo-Han Zhang, Hao Sheng, Qing-Feng Sun, Lin He</i>
<p>In a molecule formed by two atoms, energy difference between bonding and
antibonding orbitals should depend on distance of the two atoms. However,
exploring molecular orbitals of two natural atoms with tunable distance has
remained an outstanding experimental challenge. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs)
can be viewed as relativistic artificial atoms, therefore, offering a unique
platform to study molecular physics. Here, through scanning tunneling
microscope (STM), we create and directly visualize the formation process of
relativistic artificial molecules based on two coupled GQDs with tunable
distance. Our study indicates that energy difference between the bonding and
antibonding orbitals of the lowest quasibound state increases linearly with
inverse distance of the two GQDs due to the relativistic nature of the
artificial molecule. For quasibound states with higher orbital momenta, the
coupling between these states leads to half-energy spacing of the confined
states because the length of the molecular-like orbit is about twice that of
the atomic-like orbit. Evolution from ring-like whispering-gallery modes in the
artificial atoms to figure-eight orbitals in the artificial molecules is
directly imaged. The ability to resolve the coupling and orbitals of the
relativistic artificial molecule at the nanoscale level yields insights into
the behavior of quantum-relativistic matter.

<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>Magnetic skyrmions with topologically nontrivial spin textures form a variety
of periodic structures depending on microscopic interactions and lattice
symmetry. We theoretically investigate a transformation between triangular and
square skyrmion crystals against an external magnetic field in a polar
tetragonal magnet. By performing the simulated annealing for a classical spin
model, we show that the competition of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at
multiple wave vectors is a key ingredient in inducing the structural transition
in terms of the skyrmion crystals. The present results indicate the importance
of magnetic frustration in momentum space as the origin of exotic topological
phase transitions.

<br>
<i>Manodip Routh, Sayan Ghosh, Jeroen van den Brink, Satoshi Nishimoto, Manoranjan Kumar</i>
<p>Motivated by the largely unexplored domain of multi-polar ordered spin states
in the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) systems we investigate the ground state dynamics
of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KH model, focusing on quadrupolar (QP) order in 2-leg
ladder and two-dimensional honeycomb lattice geometries. Employing exact
diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group methods, we analyze
the QP order parameter and correlation functions. Our findings reveal a robust
QP order across a wide range of the phase diagram, influenced by the interplay
between Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions. Notably, we observe an enhancement
of QP order near Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases, despite the absence
of long-range spin-spin correlations. This highlights a complex relationship
between QP order and QSLs, offering new insights into quantum magnetism in
low-dimensional systems.

<i>Kurea Nakagawa, Minoru Kanega, Tomoyuki Yokouchi, Masahiro Sato, Yuki Shiomi</i>
<p>In two-dimensional (2D) spin systems, the augmentation of spin fluctuations
gives rise to quasi-long-range order; however, how they manifest in spin
transport remains unclear. Here we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in
a quasi-2D antiferromagnet, BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, which has been reported to
exhibit the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition owing to its
distinct 2D nature. We found that the SSE in Pt / BaNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ persists
well above the N\'eel temperature, significantly different from the behavior of
3D ordered magnets. Our numerical analysis for a 2D microscopic spin model
supports the hypothesis that the observed SSE is linked to strong magnetic
correlations in the BKT-like phase.

<h3>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, Stephanie Striegel, Richard T. Scalettar, Ehsan Khatami</i>
<p>The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical
lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model
(FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or
snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions
which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at
commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin
correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in
order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales,
comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent
concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when
computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or
total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to
experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models,
we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the
two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We
generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and
compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate
that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the
entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of
correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an
open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines
in experimental settings for the square lattice.

<p>Magnetic anisotropy is essential for stabilizing two-dimensional (2D)
magnetism, which has significant applications in spintronics and the
advancement of fundamental physics. In this work, we examine the electronic
structure and magnetic properties of triangular prismatic MSi$_2$N$_4$ (M = V,
Cr) monolayers, using crystal field theory, spin-orbital state analyses, and
density functional calculations. Our results reveal that the pristine
VSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer exhibits magnetism with a V$^{4+}$ 3$d^1$ $S$ = 1/2
charge-spin state within the triangular prismatic crystal field. However, the
strong $d$ orbital hybridization between adjacent V$^{4+}$ ions disrupts the
$d$ orbital splitting in this crystal field, resulting in a relatively small
in-plane magnetic anisotropy of approximately 2 $\mu$eV per V atom.In contrast,
the pristine CrSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer is nonmagnetic, characterized by the
Cr$^{4+}$ 3$d^2$ $S$ = 0 state. Upon substituting nonmagnetic Cr$^{4+}$ with
Si$^{4+}$, Cr$_\frac{1}{3}$Si$_\frac{8}{3}$N$_4$ transforms into an
antiferromagnetic insulator with Cr$^{4+}$ 3$d^2$ $S$ = 1 state, featuring a
large orbital moment of -1.06 $\mu_{\rm B}$ oriented along the $z$-axis and
huge perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of 18.63 meV per Cr atom. These findings
highlight the potential for further exploration of 2D Ising magnetic materials
within a unique triangular prismatic crystal field.

<h3>Root mean squares of distance and geodesic between two constituent  particles within fractal aggregates prepared by BCCA, DLA, and GSAW  procedures</h3>

<br>
<i>Sota Arakawa</i>
<p>Understanding the geodesic properties of fractal aggregates is essential, as
their thermal and mechanical properties are characterized by their geodesics.
In this study, we investigate the root mean square (RMS) of the geodesic
between two constituent particles within fractal aggregates prepared by
ballistic cluster-cluster aggregation (BCCA), diffusion-limited aggregation
(DLA), and growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) processes in two- and
three-dimensional spaces. We find that the dependence of the RMS of the
geodesic on the number of constituent particles is given by the following
equation: $N \approx k_{\rm g} {D_{\rm RMS}}^{d_{\rm g}}$, where $N$ is the
number of constituent particles and $D_{\rm RMS}$ is the RMS of the geodesic.
We numerically obtain the prefactor $k_{\rm g}$ and exponent $d_{\rm g}$ for
these fractal aggregates. We name the exponent ``the geodesic dimension'', and
it is compared with the fractal dimension. Our findings show that the
difference between fractal and geodesic dimensions varies significantly
depending on the preparation procedure for fractals.

<h3>Planar Hall effect from superconducting fluctuations</h3>

<br>
<i>L. Attias, K. Michaeli, M. Khodas</i>
<p>We study the planar Hall effect (PHE), and reexamine the Lifshitz invariants
in the spin-orbit coupled superconductors. In the Rashba superconductor, the
PHE is finite as fluctuations are faster along the applied field than
perpendicular to it. We consider spin-orbit splitting that is larger than the
critical temperature. In this regime the Cooper pairs are predominantly
intra-band. The effective two-band interaction matrix elements are not
sensitive enough to the field to affect the PHE. However, in a wide range of
parameters this dependence does modify the Lifshitz invariant, linear in field
and responsible for the spin diode effect. This contribution is a geometrical
effect of the adjustment of the spin texture to the applied field. As such, it
also allows the repulsion or attraction in the spin triplet channel to affect
the Lifshitz invariant. While the PHE can be studied within the effective
two-band superconductor model with an original pairing interaction, the
Lifshitz invariant, in general, cannot. Disorder is shown to only moderately
suppress the PHE.

<h3>Exploiting dynamic bifurcation in elastic ribbons for mode skipping and  selection</h3>

<i>Weicheng Huang, Tian Yu, Dominic Vella, K. Jimmy Hsia, Mingchao Liu</i>
<p>In this paper, we systematically study the dynamic snap-through behavior of a
pre-deformed elastic ribbon by combining theoretical analysis, discrete
numerical simulations, and experiments. By rotating one of its clamped ends
with controlled angular speed, we observe two snap-through transition paths
among the multiple stable configurations of a ribbon in three-dimensional (3D)
space, which is different from the classical snap-through of a two-dimensional
(2D) bistable beam. Our theoretical model for the static bifurcation analysis
is derived based on the Kirchhoff equations, and dynamical numerical
simulations are conducted using the Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) algorithm. The
planar beam model is also employed for the asymptotic analysis of dynamic
snap-through behaviors. The results show that, since the snap-through processes
of both planar beams and 3D ribbons are governed by the saddle-node
bifurcation, the same scaling law for the delay applies. We further demonstrate
that, in elastic ribbons, by controlling the rotating velocity at the end,
distinct snap-through pathways can be realized by selectively skipping specific
modes, moreover, particular final modes can be strategically achieved. Through
a parametric study using numerical simulations, we construct general phase
diagrams for both mode skipping and selection of snapping ribbons. The work
serves as a benchmark for future investigations on dynamic snap-through of thin
elastic structures and provides guidelines for the novel design of intelligent
mechanical systems.

<p>We theoretically investigate non-Hermitian $p$-wave Fermi superfluidity in
one-dimensional spin-polarized Fermi gases which is relevant to recent
ultracold atomic experiments. Considering an imaginary atom-dimer coupling
responsible for the three-body recombination process in the Lindblad formalism,
we discuss the stability of the superfluid state against the atomic loss
effect. Within the two-channel non-Hermitian BCS-Leggett theory, the atomic
loss is characterized by the product of the imaginary atom-dimer coupling and
the $p$-wave effective range. Our results indicate that for a given imaginary
atom-dimer coupling, a smaller magnitude of the effective ranges of $p$-wave
interaction is crucial for reaching the non-Hermitian $p$-wave Fermi superfluid
state.

<p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under high
pressure with a transition temperature around 80 K has sparked extensive
experimental and theoretical efforts. Several key questions regarding the
pairing mechanism remain to be answered, such as the most relevant atomic
orbitals and the role of atomic deficiencies. Here, we develop a new
energy-filtered multislice electron ptychography technique, assisted with
electron energy loss spectroscopy, to address these critical issues. Oxygen
vacancies are directly visualized and are found to primarily occupy the inner
apical sites, which have been proposed to be crucial to superconductivity. We
precisely determine the nanoscale stoichiometry and its correlation to the
oxygen K edge spectra, which reveals a significant inhomogeneity in the oxygen
content and electronic structure within the sample. The spectroscopic results
also unveil that stoichiometric La3Ni2O7 is in the charge-transfer regime, with
holes that are self-doped from Ni sites into O sites. The outer apical oxygen
is found to be less relevant to the low-energy physics and can be safely
disregarded in theoretical models. These observations will assist in further
development and understanding of superconducting nickelate materials. Our
imaging technique for quantifying atomic deficiencies can also be widely
applied in materials science and condensed matter physics.

<i>Yiming Xia, Zixian Hu, Da Wei, Ke Chen, Yi Peng, Mingcheng Yang</i>
<p>Direct mechanical coupling is known to be critical for establishing
synchronization among cilia. However, the actual role of the connections is
still elusive - partly because controlled experiments in live samples are
challenging. Here, we employ an artificial ciliary system to address this
issue. Two cilia are formed by chains of self-propelling robots and anchored to
a shared base so that they are purely mechanically-coupled. The system mimics
biological ciliary beating but allows fine control over the beating dynamics.
We find that the artificial cilia exhibit rich motion behaviors, depending on
the mechanical coupling scheme. Particularly, their synchronous beating display
two distinct modes - analogous to those observed in C. reinhardtii, the
biciliated model organism for studying synchronization. Close examination
suggests that the system evolves towards the most dissipative mode. Using this
guideline in both simulations and experiments, we are able to direct the system
into a desired state by altering the modes' respective dissipation. Our results
have significant implications in understanding the synchronization of cilia.

<h3>Magnetic impurities in an altermagnetic metal</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu-Li Lee</i>
<p>We study the physics of dilute magnetic impurities in a two-dimensional
altermagnetic metal. We first discuss the Kondo problem. Although the spin
degeneracy is broken in an altermagnetic metal, we show that the
antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling still flows to the strong coupling regime at
low energies in terms of the one-loop renormalization-group equation. To study
the ground-state properties, we employ the variational wavefunction approach.
We find that the impurity spin is completely screened at long distances, in
contrast to the usual antiferromagnet. The $d$-wave nature of the Fermi surface
in an altermagnetic metal is reflected in the correlation between the impurity
and conduction electron spins, which exhibits the $C_{4z}$ symmetry of the
altermagnet at long distances. The spin correlation decays as $1/r^3$ at long
distances, and its amplitude oscillates with four different periods due to the
anisotropic Fermi surfaces. Moreover, the values of these periods depend on the
direction of observation. Next, we calculate the RKKY interaction which is of
an anisotropic Heisenberg type. This anisotropic RKKY interaction also exhibits
the $C_4$ symmetry at long distances due to the $d$-wave nature of the Fermi
surface. In addition, the transverse and longitudinal components of the RKKY
interactions posses distinct periods of oscillations.

<h3>Why monovalent salt reduces charge inversion of macroion by trivalent  counterions</h3>

<br>
<i>Boris Shklovskii</i>
<p>A macroion with a strongly charged negative surface in 3:1 salt water
solution becomes net positive due to adsorption of an excessive number of
positive 3-ions. The widely accepted theory of such charge inversion is based
on the idea that adsorbed at the macroion surface 3-ions form a two-dimensional
strongly correlated liquid which attracts excessive 3-ions by their negative
images (correlation holes). In the absence of 1:1 salt this theory reasonably
agrees with experiments and numerical simulations. However, the same theory
predicts that adding a large concentration of 1:1 salt increases the net
positive charge, while experiments and simulations show that the charge
decreases. In this paper we argue that the theory was aiming at the case of a
very large macroion surface charge and ignored the effect of the competing
attraction of 3-ion to its screening atmosphere in the bulk of the solution. We
show that for parameters of experiments and simulations this effect makes
charge inversion weak and extremely sensitive to screening by large
concentration of 1:1 salt. As a result charge inversion decreases with addition
of 1:1 salt in agreement with experiments and simulations.

<i>Jiawei Yan, Philipp Werner</i>
<p>We present a nonequilibrium steady-state implementation of the two-particle
self-consistent method. This approach respects the Mermin-Wagner theorem and
incorporates non-local spatial fluctuations through self-consistent static
vertices. The real-frequency implementation allows to compute spectral
properties without analytical continuation in both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium. As an interesting application, we investigate spin correlations
in the bilayer square lattice Hubbard model under a perpendicular static
electric field. In equilibrium, the result yields spin correlations which are
in good agreement with recent optical lattice experiments. Under a large enough
static electric field, the inter-layer spin correlations switch from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. We clarify how this phenomenon is linked to
the nonequilibrium modifications of the spin excitation spectrum.

<p>Hot rolled commercial metastable austenitic steel 321 with strongly elongated
thin delta-ferrite particles in its microstructure was the object of
investigations. Ultrafine-grained (UFG) microstructure in steel 321 was formed
by Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at 150 oC and 450 oC. When heating the
UFG steel specimens, the nucleation of sigma-phase particles blocking the grain
boundary migration was observed. The maximum elongation to failure (~250%) was
achieved at the deformation temperature 750 oC. The process of superplastic
deformation of the UFG steel 321 is controlled by simultaneous grain boundary
sliding and power-law creep. The contribution of each process depends on the
grain growth rate in the superplasticity regime as well as on defect
accumulation on the grain boundaries. The fracture of the UFG steel 321
specimens has a cavitational character - an intensive formation of large
elongated pores at the non-metallic particles as well as of the submicron pores
at the sigma-phase particles in the course of superplastic deformation were
observed.

<p>In recent times, there have been notable advancements in haptic technology,
particularly in screens found on mobile phones, laptops, LED screens, and
control panels. However, it is essential to note that the progress in
high-temperature haptic applications is still in the developmental phase. Due
to its complex phase and domain structures, lead-free piezoelectric materials
such as BNT-based haptic technology behave differently at high temperatures
than ambient conditions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the aspects
of thermal management and thermal stability, as temperature plays a vital role
in the phase and domain transition of BNT material. A two-dimensional
thermo-electromechanical model has been proposed in this study to analyze the
thermal stability of BNT material by analyzing the impact of temperature on
effective electromechanical properties and mechanical and electric field
parameters. However, the thermo-electromechanical modelling of BNT ceramics
examines the macroscopic effects of the applied thermal field on mechanical and
electric field parameters as phase change and microdomain dynamics are not
considered in this model. This study analyzes the impact of
thermo-electromechanical coupling on the performance of BNT-type piezoelectric
materials compared to conventional electromechanical coupling. The results
predicted a significant improvement in piezoelectric response compared to
electromechanical coupling due to increased thermoelectric effect in absence of
phase change and microdomain switching for temperature boundary conditions
below depolarization temperature ($T_{d}$~200$^{\circ}$C for pure BNT
material).

<h3>Shell-shaped quantum droplet in a three-component ultracold Bose gas</h3>

<br>
<i>Yinfeng Ma, Tin-Lun Ho, Xiaoling Cui</i>
<p>We present a scheme to generate shell-shaped droplet in a three-component
(1,2,3) ultracold Bose gas. Here binary mixtures (1,2) and (2,3) form quantum
droplets due to inter-species attractions, and the two droplets are mutually
immiscible due to strong 1-3 repulsion. Importantly, the shared component-2
serves as a glue to link the two droplets together as a globally self-bound
object. In this system, the outer droplet naturally develops a shell structure,
and its radius and width can be conveniently tuned through the size of core
droplet. Moreover, to reach an equilibrium with the shell, the core droplet
displays very different spin densities as compared to the vacuum case. These
results have been demonstrated in a realistic $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K-$^{41}$K
mixture. Our scheme liberates the shell-shaped Bose gas from stringent
conditions with microgravity or fine-tuned traps, and can be readily
implemented in cold atoms laboratories on Earth. This paves the way for future
exploration of quantum droplets in curved space with non-trivial real-space
topologies.

<p>Topology and correlations are fundamental concepts in modern physics, but
their simultaneous occurrence within a single quantum phase is exceptionally
rare. In this study, we present the discovery of such a phase of matter in
Ta2Pd3Te5, a semimetal where the Coulomb interaction between electrons and
holes leads to the spontaneous formation of excitonic bound states below T=100
K. Our spectroscopy unveils the development of an insulating gap stemming from
the condensation of these excitons, thus giving rise to a highly sought-after
correlated quantum phase known as the excitonic insulator. Remarkably, our
scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal the presence of gapless
boundary modes in the excitonic insulator state. Their magnetic field response
and our theoretical calculations suggest a topological origin of these modes,
rendering Ta2Pd3Te5 as the first experimentally identified topological
excitonic insulator in a three-dimensional material not masked by any
structural phase transition. Furthermore, our study uncovers a secondary
excitonic instability below T=5 K, which differs from the primary one in having
finite momentum. We observe unprecedented tunability of its wavevector by an
external magnetic field. These findings unlock a frontier in the study of novel
correlated topological phases of matter and their tunability.

<h3>Collisions of Majorana Zero Modes</h3>

<br>
<i>Liang-Liang Wang, Wenjun Shao, Jian Li</i>
<p>We investigate the collisions of Majorana zero modes, which are presented as
inter-soliton collisional events in fermionic superfluids with spin-orbit
coupling. Our results demonstrate that, the zero energy splitting, induced by
the overlapping of inter-soliton Majorana wave-functions upon collision,
generates an effective repulsive force for Majorana states, which in turn
protected themselves against into bulk excitation. As a result, the collision
between solitons associated with Majorana zero modes appears to be repulsive
and elastic, as they do not penetrate each other but instead repel without
energy loss. As well, similar repulsive behavior is observed in collisions
between soliton-induced and defect-pinned Majorana zero modes. Our research
offers new insights into the features of Majorana fermions, and robustness in
the collisions of Majorana zero modes bodes well for the prospects of
topological quantum computation with a multitude of Majorana qubits.

<h3>Optical absorption tensors based on C$_{70}$ trimers and polymers</h3>

<i>Elnaz Rostampour, Badie Ghavami, Karin Larsson</i>
<p>The optical absorption spectrum of $C_{60}$-dimers and polymers was
investigated by Kikuo et al. in 1996\cite{harigaya1996charge}. As a compliment
to these earlier studies, the optical absorption spectrum of the $C_{70}$
fullerene has been investigated in the present study. The main purpose was then
to compare the absorption spectrum of the $C_{70}$-dimers and trimers and, more
specifically, to clarify the effect of these molecular structures on the
absorption spectrum. What is most important and decisive is then the value of
the conjugation parameter of these $C_{70}$-based molecules. In the present
study, a tight-binding model was used in calculating the optical absorption
spectra of both $C_{70}$ dimers and polymers, as well as $C_{70}$ trimers and
polymers. The change in conjugation parameter for each of these species was
found to cause variations in the corresponding optical absorption spectrum. It
was found that the absorption tensor of the $C_{70}$ trimer and the polymer
was, depending on the value of the conjugation parameters $b=0.5$ and $b=0.8$.
The situation was almost the same for the conjugation parameters $b=0.1$ and
$b=0.2$. In addition, the value of the band gap was also different depending on
the different conjugation parameters, with a reduced value for the larger
values of this parameter. As a conclusion, smaller values of the conjugation
parameter were not found to have a large effect on the absorption spectrum of
the $C_{70}$-dimers and trimers, or in other words, the effect was hardly
visible. On the contrary, the larger values caused a drastic change in the
optical absorption spectrum of the $C_{70}$-dimers and trimers.

<h3>Scalar spin chirality induced by a circularly polarized electric field  in a classical kagome magnet</h3>

<br>
<i>Ryota Yambe, Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>Noncoplanar magnetic states with a scalar spin chirality have been
intensively studied in condensed matter physics, since they exhibit fascinating
physical phenomena. We theoretically propose the generation of such noncoplanar
magnetic states by using a circularly polarized electric field. By performing
the micromagnetic simulation, we investigate a time evolution of a classical
kagome magnet irradiated by the circularly polarized electric field. As a
result, we find that the noncoplanar magnetic states are induced as a
nonequilibrium steady state irrespective of the ground-state spin
configurations. We show that the induced scalar spin chirality is controlled by
the amplitude, frequency, and polarization of the electric field. In addition,
we clarify that the mechanism of the noncoplanar magnetic states is accounted
for by effective field-induced three-spin interactions by adopting the Floquet
formalism in the high-frequency regime. We also show a condition to enhance the
scalar spin chirality. Our results present a new reference for controlling the
noncoplanar magnetic states and related phenomena by the circularly polarized
electric field.

<p>Efficiently designing lightweight alloys with combined high corrosion
resistance and mechanical properties remains an enduring topic in materials
engineering. To this end, machine learning (ML) coupled ab-initio calculations
is proposed within this study. Due to the inadequate accuracy of conventional
stress-strain ML models caused by corrosion factors, a novel reinforcement
self-learning ML algorithm (accuracy R2 >0.92) is developed. Then, a strategy
that integrates ML models, calculated energetics and mechanical moduli is
implemented to optimize the Al alloys. Next, this Computation Designed
Corrosion-Resistant Al alloy is fabricated that verified the simulation. The
performance (elongation reaches ~30%) is attributed to the H-captured Al-Sc-Cu
phases (-1.44 eV H-1) and Cu-modified {\eta}/{\eta}' precipitation inside the
grain boundaries (GBs). The developed Al-Mg-Zn-Cu interatomic potential (energy
accuracy 6.50 meV atom-1) proves the cracking resistance of the GB region
enhanced by Cu-modification. Conceptually, our strategy is of practical
importance for designing new alloys exhibiting corrosion resistance and
mechanical properties.

<h3>Observation of a 1/3 Magnetisation Plateau Phase as Evidence for the  Kitaev Interaction in a Honeycomb-Lattice Antiferromagnet</h3>

Mole, Naoki Murai, Seiko Ohira-Kawamura, Lunhua He, Jiazheng Hao, Qing-Bo Yan, Fengqi Song, Wei Li, Shun-Li Yu, Jian-Xin Li, Jinsheng Wen</i>
<p>Fractional magnetisation plateaus, in which the magnetisation is pinned at a
fraction of its saturated value within a range of external magnetic field, are
spectacular macroscopic manifestations of the collective quantum behaviours.
One prominent example of the plateau phase is found in spin-1/2
triangular-lattice antiferromagnets featuring strong geometrical frustration,
and is often interpreted as quantum-fluctuation-stabilised state in magnetic
field via the "order-by-disorder" mechanism. Here, we observe an unprecedented
1/3 magnetisation plateau between 5.2 and 7.4 T at 2 K in a spin-1
antiferromagnet Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ with a honeycomb lattice, where
conventionally no geometrical frustration is anticipated. By carrying out
elastic neutron scattering measurements, we propose the spin structure of the
plateau phase to be an unusual partial spin-flop ferrimagnetic order,
transitioning from the zigzag antiferromagnetic order in zero field. Our
theoretical calculations show that the plateau phase is stabilised by the
bond-anisotropic Kitaev interaction. These results provide a new paradigm for
the exploration of rich quantum phases in frustrated magnets and exotic Kitaev
physics in high-spin systems.

<h3>Numerical renormalization group study of Quadrupole Kondo effect with  the crystal-field excited state</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuki Kaneko, Hirokazu Tsunetsugu</i>
<p>We have studied the quadrupolar Kondo effect for an impurity in cubic
environment with taking account of a singlet excited state $\Gamma_1$, which
models a $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ ion with a non-Kramers double ground state
$\Gamma_3$. We have used the numerical renormalization group approach and
determined the phase diagram with varying quadrupole Kondo coupling $J$ and
$\Gamma_1$ excitation energy $\Delta$. Two phases are found and identified as
local Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid. This non-Fermi liquid phase is
characteristic to the two-channel Kondo impurity, and a similar phase diagram
has been also found in other extended quadrupole models. We have analyzed in
detail the $J$-dependence of the Kondo temperature $T_K$ near the phase
boundary $J_c (\Delta) $ and found a nice scaling behavior with an stretched
exponential form $T_K \sim \delta J^{\alpha} \exp
(-\mathrm{const.}/\sqrt{\delta J})$ where $\delta J \equiv J - J_c (\Delta)$.
This differs from the standard scaling form and indicates that one needs to
consider renormalization of multiple coupling constants.

<h3>Discovery of acousto-drag photovoltaic effect</h3>

<p>As a key ingredient in energy harvesting and photodetection,
light-to-electricity conversion requires efficient separation of photoexcited
electron-hole pairs before recombination. Traditional junction-based mechanisms
mainly use build-in electric fields to achieve pair separation and generate
photovoltaic effect, which fail to collect photoexcited pairs away from local
barrier region. The ability to harvest photovoltaic effect in a homogeneous
material upon uniform illumination is appealing, but has only been realized in
very few cases such as non-centrosymmetric systems through bulk photovoltaic
effect. Here we realize a new type of photovoltaic effect, termed as
acousto-drag photovoltaic effect, by travelling surface acoustic waves (t-SAW)
in a conventional layered semiconductor MoSe2. Instead of immediately driving
the electron-hole pairs to opposite directions after generation, t-SAW induces
periodic modulation to electronic bands and drags the photoexcited pairs toward
the same travelling direction. The photocurrent can then be extracted by a
local barrier, e.g. the metal-semiconductor contact as we used here. By
spatially separating the electron-hole generation and extraction processes, the
acousto-drag mechanism strongly suppresses charge recombination and yields
large nonlocal photoresponse outside the barrier region. We show that when
t-SAW is applied, the photoresponse can be enhanced by over two orders of
magnitude with exceptionally high external quantum efficiency above 60%. The
discovery of acousto-drag photovoltaic effect establishes a new approach
towards efficient light-to-electricity conversion without the restriction of
crystal symmetry.

<h3>Direct observation of topological magnon polarons in a multiferroic  material</h3>

<p>Magnon polarons are novel elementary excitations possessing hybrid magnonic
and phononic signatures, and are responsible for many exotic spintronic and
magnonic phenomena. Despite long-term sustained experimental efforts in chasing
for magnon polarons, direct spectroscopic evidence of their existence is hardly
observed. Here, we report the direct observation of magnon polarons using
neutron spectroscopy on a multiferroic Fe$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ possessing
strong magnon-phonon coupling. Specifically, below the magnetic ordering
temperature, a gap opens at the nominal intersection of the original magnon and
phonon bands, leading to two separated magnon-polaron bands. Each of the bands
undergoes mixing, interconverting and reversing between its magnonic and
phononic components. We attribute the formation of magnon polarons to the
strong magnon-phonon coupling induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
Intriguingly, we find that the band-inverted magnon polarons are topologically
nontrivial. These results uncover exotic elementary excitations arising from
the magnon-phonon coupling, and offer a new route to topological states by
considering hybridizations between different types of fundamental excitations.

<h3>Dissipation and phase transitions in superconducting circuits coupled to  normal metal resistor</h3>

<br>
<i>O. Kashuba, R.-P. Riwar</i>
<p>The Caldeira-Leggett model is the most commonly accepted approach to describe
dissipation in superconducting circuits. But the existence of the resulting
Schmidt-Bulgadaev (SB) transition is still heavily debated. We study a
microscopically motivated model for a charge qubit electrically and
capacitively coupled to a normal metal, with seemingly minute changes to
Caldeira-Leggett - but a significantly different phase diagram. While this
model still hosts an SB transition in the transmon regime, the critical
parameter is largely independent of the metal's resistivity. In the opposite
Cooper pair box regime, the system now resembles an anisotropic Kondo model
with the two degenerate charge states as the pseudo-spin. Here, however, a
transition to a ferromagnetic phase is not possible for regular electrostatic
interactions. We further argue that some of the guiding principles of our work
are transferable to resistors made of bosonic transmission lines.

<p>We give the most general formulation for gauging of generalized symmetry, in
terms of the language of higher linear algebra. In short, generalized gauging
is just condensation of designated topological operators. Our framework covers
all known variants of gauging, and may be used to discover unknown ones. In
particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible: the original theory
and the gauged theory are Morita equivalent; similarly, the original symmetry
and the gauge symmetry are also Morita equivalent.

<p>In heavy-fermion systems with $f$ electrons, there is an intricate interplay
between Kondo screening and magnetic correlations, which can give rise to
various exotic phases. Recently, similar interplay appears to also occur in
$d$-electron systems, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, using
inelastic neutron scattering, we investigate the temperature evolution of the
low-energy spin waves in a metallic van der Waals ferromagnet
Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_{2}$ (Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}\sim160$ K), where the
Kondo-lattice behavior emerges in the ferromagnetic phase below a
characteristic temperature $T^*\sim90$ K. We observe that the magnon damping
constant diverges at both low and high temperatures, exhibiting a minimum
coincidentally around $T^*$. Such an observation is analogous to the
resistivity minimum as due to the single-impurity Kondo effect. This unusual
behavior is described by a formula that combines logarithmic and power terms,
representing the dominant contributions from Kondo screening and thermal
fluctuations, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the magnon damping
increases with momentum below $T_{\rm C}$. These findings can be explained by
considering spin-flip electron-magnon scattering, which serves as a magnonic
analog of the Kondo-impurity scattering, and thus provides a measure of the
Kondo coupling through magnons. Our results provide critical insights into how
Kondo coupling manifests itself in a system with magnetic ordering and shed
light on the coexistence of and interplay between magnetic order and Kondo
effect in itinerant 3$d$-electron systems.

<p>Strain represents an ubiquitous feature in semiconductor heterostructures,
and can be engineered by different means in order to improve the properties of
various devices, including advanced MOSFETs and spin-based qubits. However, its
treatment within the envelope function framework is well established only for
the homogeneous case, thanks to the theory of Bir and Pikus. Here, we
generalize such theory to the case of inhomogeneous strain. By fully accounting
for the relativistic effects and metric aspects of the problem, we derive a

<p>Magnonics has shown the immense potential of compatibility with CMOS devices
and the ability to be utilized in futuristic quantum computing. Therefore, the
magnonic crystals, both metallic and insulating, are under extensive
exploration. The presence of high spin-orbit interaction induced by the
presence of rare-earth elements in thulium iron garnet (TmIG) increases its
potential in magnonic applications. Previously, TmIG thin films were grown
using ultra-high vacuum-based techniques. Here, we present a cost-effective
solution-based approach that enables the excellent quality interface and
surface roughness of the epitaxial TmIG/GGG. The deposited TmIG (12.2 nm) thin
film's physical and spin dynamic properties are investigated in detail. The
confirmation of the epitaxy using X-ray diffraction in $\phi$-scan geometry
along with the X-ray reflectivity and atomic force for the thickness and
roughness analysis and topography, respectively. The epitaxial TmIG/GGG have
confirmed the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy utilizing the
polar-magneto-optic Kerr effect. Analyzing the ferromagnetic resonance study of
TmIG/GGG thin films provides the anisotropy constant K$_U$ = 20.6$\times$10$^3$
$\pm$ 0.2$\times$10$^3$ N/m$^2$ and the Gilbert damping parameter $\alpha$ =

<h3>Perspective on nanoscale magnetic sensors using giant anomalous Hall  effect in topological magnetic materials for read head application in  magnetic recording</h3>

<i>Tomoya Nakatani, Prabhanjan D. Kulkarni, Hirofumi Suto, Keisuke Masuda, Hitoshi Iwasaki, Yuya Sakuraba</i>
<p>Recent advances in the study of materials with topological electronic band
structures have revealed magnetic materials exhibiting giant anomalous Hall
effects (AHE). The giant AHE has not only attracted the research interest in
its mechanism but also opened up the possibility of practical application in
magnetic sensors. In this article, we describe simulation-based investigations
of AHE magnetic sensors for the applications to read head sensors (readers) of
hard disk drives. With the shrinking of magnetic recording patterns, the reader
technology, which currently uses multilayer-based tunnel magnetoresistance
(TMR) devices, is associated with fundamental challenges, such as insufficient
spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in sensors with dimensions
below 20 nm. The structure of an AHE-based device composed of a single
ferromagnetic material is advantageous for magnetic sensors with nanoscale
dimensions. We found that AHE readers using topological ferromagnets with giant
AHE, such as Co2MnGa, can achieve a higher SNR than current TMR readers. The
higher SNR originates from the large output signal of the giant AHE as well as
from the reduced thermal magnetic noise, which is the dominant noise in TMR
readers. We highlight a major challenge in the development of AHE readers: the
reduction in the output signal due to the shunting of the bias current and the
leakage of the Hall voltage through the soft magnetic shields surrounding the
AHE reader. We propose reader structures that overcome this challenge. Finally,
we discuss the scope for future research to realize AHE readers.

<i>Johannes Sandberg, Thomas Voigtmann, Emilie Devijver, Noel Jakse</i>
<p>Neural network potentials are a powerful tool for atomistic simulations,
allowing to accurately reproduce \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces
with computational performance approaching classical force fields. A central
component of such potentials is the transformation of atomic positions into a
set of atomic features in a most efficient and informative way.In this work, a
feature selection method is introduced for high dimensional neural network
potentials, based on the Adaptive Group Lasso (AGL) approach. It is shown that
the use of an embedded method, taking into account the interplay between
features and their action in the estimator, is necessary to optimize the number
of features. The method's efficiency is tested on three different monoatomic
systems, including Lennard-Jones as a simple test case, Aluminium as a system
characterized by predominantly radial interactions, and Boron as representative
of a system with strongly directional interactions. The AGL is compared with
unsupervised filter methods and found to perform consistently better in
reducing the number of features needed to reproduce the reference simulation
data. {In particular, our results show the importance of taking into account
model predictions in feature selection for interatomic potentials.

vibrational and optical properties of the edge-functionalized hg-C3N4 quantum
dots with the aim of exploring their possible applications in solar cells and
other optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes. The functional
groups considered in this work are methyl (-CH$_3$), fluorine (-F), and
oxygenated groups such as aldehyde (-CHO), carboxyl (-COOH), ketone
(-COCH$_3$), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. The edge-functionalization resulted in
significant tuning of the electronic, vibrational, and optical properties.
Thus, their structural fingerprints are present in both their vibrational and
optical properties, thereby allowing their detection both in the Raman as well
as optical spectroscopies. It is observed that edge functionalization broadens
the energy range of optical absorption, leading to coverage of most of the
ultraviolet and visible regions. This implies that the edge-functionalization
of hg-C$_3$N$_4$ quantum dots can be used in a variety of optoelectronic
devices such as solar cells and light emitting diodes.

<i>Zheng-Rong Liu, Rui Chen, Bin Zhou</i>
<p>Floquet topological insulators have been widely investigated in
lower-dimensional systems. However, Floquet topological insulators in
higher-dimensional systems remain unexplored. In this work, we study the
effects of time-periodic driving in a four-dimensional (4D) normal insulator,
focusing on topological phase transitions at the resonant quasienergy gap. We
consider two types of time-periodic driving, including a time-periodic onsite
potential and a time-periodic vector potential. We reveal that both types of
the time-periodic driving can transform the 4D normal insulator into a 4D
Floquet topological insulator characterized by an emergent second Chern number.
Moreover, it is found that the topological phase of the 4D system can be
modulated by tuning the strength of the time-periodic driving. Our work will be
helpful for future investigations on Floquet topological insulators in higher
dimensions.

<p>Addressing high-dimensional partial differential equations (HDPDEs) to derive
effective actions within the functional renormalization group is formidable,
especially when considering various field configurations, including
inhomogeneous states, even on lattices. We leverage a physics-informed neural
network (PINN) as a state-of-the-art machine learning method for solving HDPDEs
to overcome this challenge. In a 0-D O($N$) model, we numerically demonstrate
the construction of an effective action on an $N$-D configuration space,
extending up to $N=100$. Our results underscore the effectiveness of PINN
approximation, even in scenarios lacking small parameters such as a small
coupling.

<p>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host tightly bound quasi-particles
called excitons. Based on spin and momentum selection rules, these excitons can
be either optically bright or dark. In tungsten-based TMDs, momentum-forbidden
dark exciton is the energy ground state and therefore it strongly affect the
emission properties. In this work, we brighten the momentum forbidden dark
exciton by placing WS$_2$ on top of nanotextured substrates which put the
WS$_2$ layer under tensile strain, modifying electronic bandstructure. This
enables phonon assisted scattering of exciton between momentum valleys, thereby
brightening momentum forbidden dark excitons. Our results will pave the way to
design ultrasensitive strain sensing devices based on TMDs.

<h3>Robust $T$-Linear Resistivity due to SU(4) Valley + Spin Fluctuation  Mechanism in Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16042</a>
<br>
<i>Daisuke Inoue, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</i>
<p>In the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), non-Fermi liquid like
transport phenomena are universally observed. To understand their origin, we
perform the self-consistent analysis of the self-energy due to SU(4) valley +
spin fluctuations induced by the electron-electron correlation. In the SU(4)
fluctuation mechanism, the fifteen channels of fluctuations contribute
additively to the self-energy. Therefore, the SU(4) fluctuation mechanism gives
much higher electrical resistance than the spin fluctuation mechanism. By the
same reason, SU(4) fluctuations of intermediate strength provide $T$-linear
resistivity down to $\sim1$K. Interestingly, the $T$-linear resistivity is
robustly realizedfor wide range of electron filling, even away from the
van-Hove filling. This study provides a strong evidence for the importance of
electron-electron correlation in MATBG.

<h3>Intrinsic and extrinsic anomalous transport properties in noncollinear  antiferromagnetic Mn$_3$Sn from first-principle calculations</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiuxian Yang, Wanxiang Feng, Xiaodong Zhou, Yuriy Mokrousov, Yugui Yao</i>
<p>Mn$_3$Sn has garnered significant attention due to its kagome lattice,
120$^\circ$ noncollinear antiferromagnetic order, and substantial anomalous
Hall effect. In this study, we comprehensively explore intrinsic and extrinsic
contributions to anomalous Hall, anomalous Nernst, and anomalous thermal Hall
effects, employing first-principle calculations and group theory analysis.
Comparative analysis between our theoretical results and available experimental
data underscores the predominance of intrinsic mechanism in shaping anomalous
transport properties at low temperatures. Specifically, Weyl fermions are
identified as the primary contributors to intrinsic anomalous Hall
conductivity. The significance of extrinsic mechanisms becomes evident at high
temperatures, especially when the longitudinal charge conductivity falls into
the dirty regime, where the side jump mechanism plays a vital role. Extrinsic
contributions to anomalous transport properties are primarily influenced by the
electronic states residing at the Fermi surfaces. Furthermore, anomalous
transport properties exhibit periodic variations when subjected to spin
rotations within the kagome plane, achievable by applying an external magnetic
field. Our findings advance the understanding of anomalous transport phenomena
in Mn$_3$Sn and offer insights into potential applications of noncollinear
antiferromagnetic materials in spintronics and spin caloritronics.

<h3>Ternary Alkali Metal Copper Chalcogenides ACuX (A= Na, K and X= S, Se,  Te): Promising Candidate for Solar Harvesting Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16063" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16063</a>
<br>
<i>Gurudayal Behera, Surabhi Suresh Nair, Nirpendra Singh, K. R. Balasubramaniam, Aftab Alam</i>
<p>We report a comprehensive first-principles study of the relative stability of
the various possible crystal structures, and the electronic and optical
properties of ternary alkali metal chalcogenides ACuX (A= Na/K and X= S/Se/Te)
compounds through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetics
and phonon spectra of greater than 700 structures were compared, and seven
possible stabilized structures of six ACuX compounds were identified using the
fixed composition evolutionary search method. Our electronic band structure
simulation confirms that all the ternary ACuX compounds are direct band gap
semiconductors, with the band gap lying between 0.83 eV to 2.88 eV. These
compounds exhibit directly allowed electronic transitions from the valence band
to the conduction band, which leads to a significant strength of optical
transition probability. This yields a sharp rise in the optical absorption
spectra (ranging between 10$^4$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-1}$) near the energy gap. The
estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) is about 18% for an 8
$\mu$m thick NaCuTe film. For other ACuX compounds, the SLME ranges between 10%
to 13%. In addition, we also explored the feasibility of these ternary ACuX
compounds for photocatalytic water splitting applications and found that they
can be promising candidates as photocathodes for hydrogen evolution reactions.
With a large spread in the band gap and interesting band topology near Fermi
level, these chalcogenides can be quite fertile for other energy applications
such as thermoelectric, LED, etc.

<h3>Compositional Search of Stable Crystalline Structures in Multi-Component  Alloys Using Generative Diffusion Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16073" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16073</a>
<br>
<i>Grzegorz Kaszuba, Amirhossein Naghdi Dorabati, Stefanos Papanikolaou, Andrzej Jaszkiewicz, Piotr Sankowski</i>
<p>Exploring the vast composition space of multi-component alloys presents a
challenging task for both \textit{ab initio} (first principles) and
experimental methods due to the time-consuming procedures involved. This
ultimately impedes the discovery of novel, stable materials that may display
exceptional properties. Here, the Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder
(CDVAE) model is adapted to characterize the stable compositions of a well
studied multi-component alloy, NiFeCr, with two distinct crystalline phases
known to be stable across its compositional space. To this end, novel
extensions to CDVAE were proposed, enhancing the model's ability to reconstruct
configurations from their latent space within the test set by approximately
30\% . A fact that increases a model's probability of discovering new materials
when dealing with various crystalline structures. Afterwards, the new model is
applied for materials generation, demonstrating excellent agreement in
identifying stable configurations within the ternary phase space when compared
to first principles data. Finally, a computationally efficient framework for
inverse design is proposed, employing Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of
multi-component alloys with reliable interatomic potentials, enabling the
optimization of materials property across the phase space.

<h3>Targeted materials discovery using Bayesian algorithm execution</h3>

<i>Sathya Chitturi, Akash Ramdas, Yue Wu, Brian Rohr, Stefano Ermon, Jennifer Dionne, Felipe H. da Jornada, Mike Dunne, Christopher Tassone, Willie Neiswanger, Daniel Ratner</i>
<p>Rapid discovery and synthesis of new materials requires intelligent data
acquisition strategies to navigate large design spaces. A popular strategy is
Bayesian optimization, which aims to find candidates that maximize material
properties; however, materials design often requires finding specific subsets
of the design space which meet more complex or specialized goals. We present a
framework that captures experimental goals through straightforward user-defined
filtering algorithms. These algorithms are automatically translated into one of
three intelligent, parameter-free, sequential data acquisition strategies
(SwitchBAX, InfoBAX, and MeanBAX). Our framework is tailored for typical
discrete search spaces involving multiple measured physical properties and
short time-horizon decision making. We evaluate this approach on datasets for
TiO$_2$ nanoparticle synthesis and magnetic materials characterization, and
show that our methods are significantly more efficient than state-of-the-art
approaches.

<p>The coherent control of interacting spins in semiconductor quantum dots is of
strong interest for quantum information processing as well as for studying
quantum magnetism from the bottom up. On paper, individual spin-spin couplings
can be independently controlled through gate voltages, but nonlinearities and
crosstalk introduce significant complexity that has slowed down progress in
past years. Here, we present a $2\times4$ germanium quantum dot array with full
and controllable interactions between nearest-neighbor spins. As a
demonstration of the level of control, we define four singlet-triplet qubits in
this system and show two-axis single-qubit control of all qubits and SWAP-style
two-qubit gates between all neighbouring qubit pairs. Combining these
operations, we experimentally implement a circuit designed to generate and
distribute entanglement across the array. These results highlight the potential
of singlet-triplet qubits as a competing platform for quantum computing and
indicate that scaling up the control of quantum dot spins in extended bilinear
arrays can be feasible.

<h3>Information engine with feedback delay based on a two level system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16102</a>
<br>
<i>Kiran V, Toby Joseph</i>
<p>An information engine based on a two level system in contact with a thermal
reservoir is studied analytically. The model incorporates delay time between
the measurement of the state of the system and the feedback. The engine
efficiency and work extracted per cycle are studied as a function of delay time
and energy spacing between the two levels. It is found that the range of delay
time over which one can extract work from the information engine increases with
temperature. For delay times comparable to the relaxation time, efficiency and
work per cycle are both maximum when $k_B T \approx 2 U_0$, the energy
difference between the levels. Generalized Jarzynski equality and the
generalized integral fluctuation theorem are explicitly verified for the model.
The results from the model are compared with the simulation results for a
feedback engine based on a particle moving in a $1D$ square potential. The
variation of efficiency, work per cycle and efficacy with the delay time is
compared using relaxation time in the two state model as the fitting parameter
and leads to good fit.

<h3>Dynamical polarization function, plasmons, their damping and collective  effects in semi-Dirac bands</h3>

<br>
<i>Gabrielle Ross-Harvey, Andrii Iurov, Liubov Zhemchuzhna, Godfrey Gumbs, Danhong Huang</i>
<p>We have calculated the dynamical polarization, plasmons and damping rates in
semi-Dirac bands (SDB's) with zero band gap and half-linear, half-parabolic
low-energy spectrum. The obtained plasmon dispersions are strongly anisotropic
and demonstrate some crucial features of both two-dimensional electron gas and
graphene. Such gapless energy dispersions lead to a localized area of undamped
and low-damped plasmons in a limited range of the frequencies and wave vectors.
The calculated plasmon branches demonstrate an increase of their energies for a
finite tilting of the band structure and a fixed Fermi level which could be
used as a signature of a specific tilted spectrum in a semi-Dirac band.

<h3>Photoinduced metallic Volkov-Pankratov states in semi-Dirac material</h3>

<br>
<i>SK Firoz Islam</i>
<p>We study the emergence of interfacial modes between the two regions of a
semi-Dirac type material, which are illuminated by the left and right
circularly polarized light, respectively. We show that a smooth boundary
between the two regions give rise to an interfacial quantum well which is
sensitive to the incoming electron's momentum. The quantum well is found to
host the Volkov-Pankratov states which are gapless metallic in nature. Contrary
to the inverted mass term, it is the inverted velocity term that induces such
states across the boundary. We also note that incident electron can fully pass
over the interfacial well without any reflection only at certain light
parameters-known as {\it Ramsauer-Townsend} effect. Moreover, we also observe
that such modes can even exist across the interface between the irradiated and
non-irradiated regions under certain condition.

<h3>Magnetic vortex control with current-induced axial magnetization in  centrosymmetric Weyl materials</h3>

<br>
<i>J. G. Yang, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak, D. A. Pesin</i>
<p>We consider magnetic Weyl metals as a platform to achieve current control of
magnetization textures with transport currents, utilizing their underlying band
geometry. We show that the transport current in a Weyl semimetal produces an
axial magnetization due to orbital magnetic moments of the Weyl electrons. The
associated axial magnetization can generate a torque acting on the localized
magnetic moments. For the case of a magnetic vortex in a nanodisk of Weyl
materials, this current-induced torque can be used to reverse its circulation
and polarity. We discuss the axial magnetization torques in Weyl metals on
general symmetry grounds, and compare their strength to current-induced torques
in more conventional materials.

<p>Large-bipolarons' self-trapped holes primarily span four oxygens
circumscribed by four coppers in a CuO2 plane. The oxygens relax inward and the
coppers relax outward. Concomitant oxygen-to-copper electron transfer leaves a
singlet in a molecular orbital. Its d-symmetry tracks the four-oxygens'
predominant zero-point radial vibrations. These large bipolarons' distinctive
charge transport, absorption, magnetism, local atomic vibrations, condensation
into a liquid and subsequent superconductivity are consistent with cuprate
superconductors' unusual properties.

<h3>Large composite fermion effective mass at filling factor 5/2</h3>

<i>M. Petrescu, Z. Berkson-Korenberg, Sujatha Vijayakrishnan, K. W. West, L. N. Pfeiffer, G. Gervais</i>
<p>The 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect in the second Landau level of
extremely clean two-dimensional electron gases has attracted much attention due
to its topological order predicted to host quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian
quantum statistics and could serve as a basis for fault-tolerant quantum
computations. While previous works have establish the Fermi liquid (FL) nature
of its putative composite fermion (CF) normal phase, little is known regarding
its thermodynamics properties and as a result its effective mass is entirely
unknown. Here, we report on time-resolved specific heat measurements at filling
factor 5/2, and we examine the ratio of specific heat to temperature as a
function of temperature. Combining these specific heat data with existing
longitudinal thermopower data measuring the entropy in the clean limit we find
that, unless a phase transition/crossover gives rise to large specific heat
anomaly, both datasets point towards a large effective mass in the FL phase of
CFs at 5/2. We estimate the effective-to-bare mass ratio m*/me to be ranging
from ~2 to 4, which is two to three times larger than previously measured
values in the first Landau level.

<h3>Andreev bound states in superconductor-barrier-superconductor junctions  of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Ipsita Mandal</i>
<p>We consider a superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) sandwich
configuration built with Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal featuring four band
crossings at a single nodal point. Assuming a homogenous s-wave pairing in each
superconducting region, and the barrier region created by applying a voltage of
magnitude $V_0 $ across a piece of normal state semimetal, we apply the BdG
formalism to compute the discreet energy spectrum $\varepsilon $ of the subgap
Andreev bound states in the short-barrier regime. In contrast with the two-band
semimetals studied earlier, we find upto four pairs of localized states (rather
than one pair for two-band semimetals) in the thin-barrier limit, and each
value of $\varepsilon $ has a complicated dependence on the phase difference
$\varphi_{12} $ via cosine and sine functions, which cannot be determined
analytically. These are artifacts of multiple band crossings hosting
quasiparticles of pseudospin value greater than $1/2$. Using the bound state
energies, we compute the Josephson current across the junction configuration.
