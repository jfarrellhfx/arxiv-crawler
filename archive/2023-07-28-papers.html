<h3>Viscosity and Stokes-Einstein relation in deeply supercooled water under  pressure</h3>

We report measurements of the shear viscosity $\eta$ in water up to
$150\,\mathrm{MPa}$ and down to $229.5\,\mathrm{K}$. This corresponds to more
than $30\,\mathrm{K}$ supercooling below the melting line. The temperature
dependence is non-Arrhenius at all pressures. The pressure dependence is
non-monotonic, with a pressure-induced decrease of viscosity by more than 50 %
at low temperature. Combining our data with literature data on the
self-diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{s}$ of water, we check the
Stokes-Einstein relation which, based on hydrodynamics, predicts constancy of
$D_\mathrm{s} \eta/T$, where $T$ is the temperature. The observed temperature
and pressure dependence of $D_\mathrm{s} \eta/T$ is analogous to that obtained
in simulations of a realistic water model. This suggests that, if real
supercooled water possesses a liquid-liquid transition, its critical pressure
lies close to the range $50$ to $100\,\mathrm{MPa}$.

<h3>An entropic effect essential for surface entrapment of bacteria</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14664" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14664</a>
<br>
<i>Premkumar Leishangthem, Xinliang Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
The entrapment of bacteria near boundary surfaces is of biological and
practical importance, yet the underlying physics is still not well understood.
We demonstrate that it is crucial to include a commonly neglected entropic
effect arising from the spatial variation of hydrodynamic interactions, through
a model that provides analytic explanation of bacterial entrapment in two
dimensionless parameters: $\alpha_1$ the ratio of thermal energy to
self-propulsion, and $\alpha_2$ an intrinsic shape factor. For $\alpha_1$ and
$\alpha_2$ that match an {\it Escherichia coli} at room temperature, our model
quantitatively reproduces existing experimental observations, including two key
features that have not been previously resolved: The bacterial "nose-down"
configuration, and the anticorrelation between the pitch angle and the wobbling
angle. Furthermore, our model analytically predicts the existence of an
entrapment zone in the parameter space defined by $\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2\}$.

<h3>Learning locally dominant force balances in active particle systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14970</a>
<br>
<i>Dominik Sturm, Suryanarayana Maddu, Ivo F. Sbalzarini</i>
<br>
<br>
We use a combination of unsupervised clustering and sparsity-promoting
inference algorithms to learn locally dominant force balances that explain
macroscopic pattern formation in self-organized active particle systems. The
self-organized emergence of macroscopic patterns from microscopic interactions
between self-propelled particles can be widely observed nature. Although
hydrodynamic theories help us better understand the physical basis of this
phenomenon, identifying a sufficient set of local interactions that shape,
regulate, and sustain self-organized structures in active particle systems
remains challenging. We investigate a classic hydrodynamic model of
self-propelled particles that produces a wide variety of patterns, like asters
and moving density bands. Our data-driven analysis shows that propagating bands
are formed by local alignment interactions driven by density gradients, while
steady-state asters are shaped by a mechanism of splay-induced negative
compressibility arising from strong particle interactions. Our method also
reveals analogous physical principles of pattern formation in a system where
the speed of the particle is influenced by local density. This demonstrates the
ability of our method to reveal physical commonalities across models. The
physical mechanisms inferred from the data are in excellent agreement with
analytical scaling arguments and experimental observations.

<i>Riccardo Fantoni</i>

<br>
We perform Monte Carlo simulation of the thermodynamic and structural
properties of Hard-, Square-Well, and Square-Shoulder Disks in narrow channels.
For the thermodynamics we study the internal energy per particle and the
longitudinal and transverse compressibility factor. For the structure we study
the Transverse Density and Density of Pairs Profiles, the Radial Distribution
Function and Longitudinal Distribution Function, and the (static) Longitudinal
Structure Factor. We compare our results with a recent exact semi-analytic
solution found by Montero and Santos for the single file formation and first
nearest neighbor fluid and explore how their solution performs when these
conditions are not fulfilled making it just an approximation.

<h3>On Negative Mass, Partition Function and Entropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14369" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14369</a>
<br>
<i>S. D. Campos</i>
<br>
<br>
This work examines some aspects related to the existence of negative mass.
The requirement for the partition function to converge leads to two distinct
approaches. Initially, convergence is achieved by assuming a negative absolute
temperature, which results in an imaginary partition function and complex
entropy. Subsequently, convergence is maintained by keeping the absolute
temperature positive while introducing an imaginary velocity. This modification
leads to a positive partition function and real entropy. It seems the
utilization of imaginary velocity may yield more plausible physical results
compared to the use of negative temperature, at least for the partition
function and entropy.

In the paper "Life, the Universe, and everything-42 fundamental questions",

<h3>Tunable Magnon-Photon Coupling by Magnon Band Gap in a Layered Hybrid  Perovskite Antiferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14447</a>
<br>
<i>Yi Li, Timothy Draher, Andrew H. Comstock, Yuzan Xiong, Md Azimul Haque, Elham Easy, Jiang-Chao Qian, Tomas Polakovic, John E. Pearson, Ralu Divan, Jian-Min Zuo, Xian Zhang, Ulrich Welp, Wai-Kwong Kwok, Axel Hoffmann, Joseph M. Luther, Matthew C. Beard, Dali Sun, Wei Zhang, Valentine Novosad</i>
<br>
<br>
Tunability of coherent coupling between fundamental excitations is an
important prerequisite for expanding their functionality in hybrid quantum
systems. In hybrid magnonics, the dipolar interaction between magnon and photon
usually persists and cannot be switched off. Here, we demonstrate this
capability by coupling a superconducting resonator to a layered hybrid
perovskite antiferromagnet, which exhibits a magnon band gap due to its
intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The pronounced temperature
sensitivity of the magnon band gap location allows us to set the photon mode
within the gap and to disable magnon-photon hybridization. When the resonator
mode falls into the magnon band gap, the resonator damping rate increases due
to the nonzero coupling to the detuned magnon mode. This phenomena can be used
to quantify the magnon band gap using an analytical model. Our work brings new
opportunities in controlling coherent information processing with quantum
properties in complex magnetic materials.

<h3>On Random Allocation Models in the Thermodynamic Limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14466" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14466</a>
<br>
<i>Piotr Bialas, Zdzislaw Burda, Desmond A. Johnston</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss the phase transition and critical exponents in the random
allocation model (urn model) for different statistical ensembles. We provide a
unified presentation of the statistical properties of the model in the
thermodynamic limit, uncover new relationships between the thermodynamic
potentials and fill some lacunae in previous results on the singularities of
these potentials at the critical point and behaviour in the thermodynamic
limit.
The presentation is intended to be self-contained, so we carefully derive all
formulae step by step throughout. Additionally, we comment on a
quasi-probabilistic normalisation of configuration weights which has been
considered in some recent studies

<h3>Rényi Entropy of Zeta-Urns</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14472</a>
<br>
<i>Piotr Bialas, Zdzislaw Burda, Desmond A. Johnston</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate analytically the Renyi entropy for the zeta-urn model with a
Gibbs measure definition of the micro-state probabilities. This allows us to
obtain the singularities in the R\'enyi entropy from those of the thermodynamic
potential, which is directly related to the free energy density of the model.
We enumerate the various possible behaviours of the R\'enyi entropy and its
singularities, which depend on both the value of the power law in the zeta-urn
and the order of the R\'enyi entropy under consideration

<h3>Monitoring High-Pressure Fe Recrystallization Kinetics In Situ using  High-Energy X-ray Diffraction during Multi-anvil Compression</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14478" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14478</a>
<br>
<i>Darren C. Pagan, Lukas A. Kissel, Matthew L. Whitaker</i>
<br>
<br>
Pressures often exceeding several times the yield strength of an alloy are
encountered in many metal forming processes. These pressures alter the
thermodynamics and kinetics of microstructural evolution which is generally not
accounted for in microstructure predictions due to the challenges of
quantitative characterization. Here we quantitatively observe changes with
pressure in recrystallization kinetics of pure Fe in situ through adaptation of
synchrotron X-ray compatible multi-anvil presses, originally designed for
studying mineral deformation in the mantle. Recrystallization of pure Fe is
monitored using in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction at 675 {\deg}C with 1 and
2 GPa applied. Principal component analysis applied to the in situ diffraction
data is used to quantify the transition from a fine-grained microstructure with
high dislocation content to a coarse-grained microstructure with low
dislocation content. The recrystallization rates are characterized by fitting
Avrami functions to the first principal component of the diffraction data and
showed significantly slowed transformation kinetics with increasing pressure,
despite indications of an increased recrystallization nucleation rate.

<h3>Fundamental Scaling Relationships in Additive Manufacturing and their  Implications for Future Manufacturing Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14497" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14497</a>
<br>
<i>David M. Wirth, Chi Chung Li, Jonathan K. Pokorski, Hayden K. Taylor, Maxim Shusteff</i>
<br>
<br>
The field of additive manufacturing (AM) has advanced considerably over
recent decades through the development of novel methods, materials, and
systems. However, as the field approaches maturity, it is relevant to
investigate the scaling frontiers and fundamental limits of AM in a generalized
sense. Here we propose a simplified universal mathematical model that describes
the essential process dynamics of many AM hardware platforms. We specifically
examine the influence of several key parameters on total manufacturing time,
comparing these with performance results obtained from real-world AM systems.
We find a inverse-cubic dependency on minimal feature size and a linear
dependency on overall structure size. These relationships imply how certain
process features such as parallelization and process dimensionality can help
move toward the fundamental limits. AM methods that are capable of varying the
size of deposited voxels provide one possibility to overcome these limits in
the future development of AM. We also propose a new framework for classifying
manufacturing processes as "top-down" vs "bottom-up" paradigms, which differs
from the conventional usage of such terms, and present considerations for how
"bottom-up" manufacturing approaches may surpass the fundamental limits of
"top-down" systems.

<h3>Can spin-component scaled MP2 achieve kJ/mol accuracy for cohesive  energies of molecular crystals?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14514</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Hsuan Liang, Hong-Zhou Ye, Timothy C. Berkelbach</i>
<br>
<br>
Achieving kJ/mol accuracy in the cohesive energy of molecular crystals, as
necessary for crystal structure prediction and the resolution of polymorphism,
is an ongoing challenge in computational materials science. Here, we evaluate
the performance of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2),
including its spin-component scaled models, by calculating the cohesive
energies of the 23 molecular crystals contained in the X23 dataset. Our
calculations are performed with periodic boundary conditions and Brillouin zone
sampling, and we converge results to the thermodynamic limit and the complete
basis set limit to an accuracy of about 1 kJ/mol (0.25 kcal/mol), which is
rarely achieved in previous MP2 calculations of molecular crystals. Comparing
to experimental cohesive energies, we find that MP2 has a mean absolute error
of 12.9 kJ/mol, which is comparable to that of DFT using the PBE functional and
TS dispersion correction. Separate scaling of the opposite-spin and same-spin
components of the correlation energy, with parameters previously determined for
molecular interactions, reduces the mean absolute error to 9.5 kJ/mol, and
reoptimizing the spin-component scaling parameters for the X23 set further
reduces the mean absolute error to 7.5 kJ/mol.

<h3>Giant spin-charge conversion in ultrathin films of the MnPtSb  half-Heusler compound</h3>

<br>
<br>
Half-metallic half-Heusler compounds with strong spin-orbit-coupling and
broken inversion symmetry in their crystal structure are promising materials
for generating and absorbing spin-currents, thus enabling the electric
manipulation of magnetization in energy-efficient spintronic devices. In this
work, we report the spin-to-charge conversion in sputtered ultrathin films of
the half-Heusler compound MnPtSb with thickness (t) in the range from 1 to 6
nm. A combination of X-ray and transmission electron microscopy measurements
evidence the epitaxial nature of these ultrathin non-centrosymmetric MnPtSb
films, with a clear (111)-orientation obtained on top of (0001) single-crystal
sapphire substrates. The study of the thickness (t)-dependent magnetization
dynamics of the MnPtSb(t)/Co(5nm)/Au(5nm) heterostructure revealed that the
MnPtSb compound can be used as an efficient spin current generator, even at
film thicknesses as low as 1 nm. By making use of spin pumping FMR, we measure
a remarkable t-dependent spin-charge conversion in the MnPtSb layers, which
clearly demonstrate the interfacial origin of the conversion. When interpreted
as arising from the inverse Edelstein effect (IEE), the spin-charge conversion
efficiency extracted at room temperature for the thinnest MnPtSb layer reaches
{\lambda}IEE~3 nm, representing an extremely high spin-charge conversion
efficiency at room temperature. The still never explored ultrathin regime of
the MnPtSb films studied in this work and the discover of their outstanding
functionality are two ingredients which demonstrate the potentiality of such
materials for future applications in spintronics.

<h3>Competition between fractional quantum Hall liquid and electron solid  phases in the Landau levels of multilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14519</a>
<br>
<i>Rakesh K. Dora, Ajit C. Balram</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the competition between the electron liquid and solid phases, such
as Wigner crystal and bubbles, in partially filled Landau levels (LLs) of
multilayer graphene. Graphene systems offer a versatile platform for
controlling band dispersion by varying the number of its stacked layers. The
band dispersion determines the LL wave functions, and consequently, the
LL-projected Coulomb interaction in graphene and its multilayers is different
from that in conventional semiconductors like GaAs. As a result, the energies
of the liquid and solid phases are different in the different LLs of multilayer
graphene, leading to a new phase diagram for the stability of these phases,
which we work out. The phase diagram of competing solid and liquid phases in
the LLs of monolayer graphene has been studied previously. Here, we primarily
consider $AB{-}$ or Bernal$-$stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) and $ABC{-}$stacked
trilayer graphene (TLG) and focus on the Laughlin fractions. We determine the
cohesive energy of the solid phase using the Hartree-Fock approximation while
the energy of the Laughlin liquid is computed analytically via the plasma sum
rules. We find that at the Laughlin fillings, the electron liquid phase has the
lowest energy among the phases considered in the $\mathcal{N}{=}0, 1, 2$ LLs of
BLG, as well as in the $\mathcal{N}{=}3, 4$ LLs of TLG, while in the
$\mathcal{N}{>}2$ LLs of BLG and $\mathcal{N}{>}4$ LLs of TLG, the solid phases
are more favorable. We also discuss the effect of impurities on the
above-mentioned phase diagram.

<h3>Electromagnon excitations in high temperature superconducting states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14533</a>
<br>
<i>Yong-Jun Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
We discover a fundamental excitation called electromagnon in the cuprate
superconducting states. Electromagnon excitations are found to result from the
Heisenberg exchange interaction between spins under the mean field from doped
holes described as an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in high
temperature superconducting states. The energy of electromagon, peak position
of Fourier transformation of electric polarization, decreases linearly with
decrease of exchange interaction in various families of superconductors.
Comparisons with superconductivity-induced B1g Raman peaks show good agreement
and thus provide the experimental evidences of electromagon exciations in
cuprates.

<h3>Symmetry of the emergent inductance tensor exhibited by magnetic  textures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14542</a>
<br>
<i>Soju Furuta, Wataru Koshibae, Fumitaka Kagawa</i>
<br>
<br>
Metals hosting gradually varying spatial magnetic textures are attracting
attention as a new class of inductor. Under the application of an alternating
current, the spin-transfer-torque effect induces oscillating dynamics of the
magnetic texture, which subsequently yields the spin-motive force as a back
action, resulting in an inductive voltage response. In general, a second-order
tensor representing a material's response can have an off-diagonal component.
However, it is unclear what symmetries the emergent inductance tensor has and
also which magnetic textures can exhibit a transverse inductance response. Here
we reveal both analytically and numerically that the emergent inductance tensor
should be a symmetric tensor in the so-called adiabatic limit. By considering
this symmetric tensor in terms of symmetry operations that a magnetic texture
has, we further characterize the magnetic textures in which the transverse
inductance response can appear. This finding provides a basis for exploring the
transverse response of emergent inductors, which has yet to be discovered.

<h3>Pair-distribution function of active Brownian spheres in three spatial  dimensions: simulation results and analytical representation</h3>

<br>
<i>Stephan Bröker, Michael te Vrugt, Julian Jeggle, Joakim Stenhammar, Raphael Wittkowski</i>
<br>
<br>
The pair-distribution function, which provides information about correlations
in a system of interacting particles, is one of the key objects of theoretical
soft matter physics. In particular, it allows for microscopic insights into the
phase behavior of active particles. While this function is by now well studied
for two-dimensional active matter systems, the more complex and more realistic
case of three-dimensional systems is not well understood by now. In this work,
we analyze the full pair-distribution function of spherical active Brownian
particles interacting via a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential in three spatial
dimensions using Brownian dynamics simulations. Besides extracting the
structure of the pair-distribution function from the simulations, we obtain an
analytical representation for this function, parametrized by activity and
concentration, which takes into account the symmetries of a homogeneous
stationary state. Our results are useful as input to quantitative models of
active Brownian particles and advance our understanding of the microstructure
in dense active fluids.

<h3>Quantum Phase Transition of Organic Spin Liquid Tuned by Mixing  Counterions</h3>

We found a plateau in the magnitude of the isolated magnetic moments as a
function of the anisotropy of the transfer integral (t'/t) in the gapless
quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase of an S=1/2 triangular lattice molecular solid
X[Pd(dmit)2]2 (dmit = 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate), accomplished by a
fine-tuning of t'/t through the mixing of cations, X. In contrast, the magnetic
susceptibility at the lowest temperature in the QSL phase parametrized by t'/t
evinces an unconventional suppression approaching the quantum phase transition,
implying significant dynamic fluctuations.

<h3>Interfaces in crystalline materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14569" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14569</a>

<i>Aurélien Vattré</i>

Interfaces such as grain boundaries in polycrystalline as well as
heterointerfaces in multiphase are ubiquitous in materials science and
engineering. Far from being featureless dividing surfaces between neighboring
crystals, elucidating features of solid-solid interfaces is challenging and
requires theoretical and numerical strategies to describe the physical and
mechanical characteristics of these internal interfaces. The first part of this
manuscript is concerned with interface-dominated microstructures emerging from
polymorphic structural (diffusionless) phase transformations. Under high
hydrostatic compression and shock-wave conditions, the pressure-driven phase
transitions and the formation of internal diffuse interfaces in iron are
captured by a thermodynamically consistent framework for combining nonlinear
elastoplasticity and multivariant phase-field approach at large strains. The
calculations investigate the crucial role played by the plastic deformation in
the morphological and microstructure evolution processes under high hydrostatic
compression and shock-wave conditions. The second section is intended to
describe such imperfect interfaces at a finer scale, for which the semicoherent
interfaces are described by misfit dislocation networks that produce a
lattice-invariant deformation which disrupts the uniformity of the lattice
correspondence across the interfaces and thereby reduces coherency. For the
past ten years, the constant effort has been devoted to combining the closely
related Frank-Bilby and O-lattice techniques with the Stroh sextic formalism
for the anisotropic elasticity theory of interfacial dislocation patterns. The
structures and energetics are quantified and used for rapid computational
design of interfaces with tailored misfit dislocation patterns, including the
interface sink strength for radiation-induced point defects and semicoherent
interfaces.

<h3>$ \mathrm{Sr}_{4}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$: A New Sacrificial Layer  with High Water Dissolution Rate for the Synthesis of Freestanding Oxide  Membranes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14584" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14584</a>

<br>
<br>
Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes have drawn great attention recently
since they offer exceptional structural tunability and stacking ability,
providing new opportunities in fundamental research and potential device
applications in silicon-based semiconductor technology. Among different types
of sacrificial layers, the $ \mathrm{(Ca, Sr,
Ba)}_{3}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$ compounds are most widely used since
they can be dissolved in water and prepare high-quality perovskite oxide
membranes with clean and sharp surfaces and interfaces. However, the typical
transfer process takes a long time (up to hours) in obtaining millimeter-size
freestanding membranes, let alone realize wafer-scale samples with high yield.
Here, we introduce a new member of the $
\mathrm{SrO-}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ family,$
\mathrm{Sr}_{4}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7},$, and demonstrate its high
dissolution rate, about 10 times higher than that of $
\mathrm{Sr}_{3}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$. The high-dissolution-rate of $
\mathrm{Sr}_{4}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ is most likely related to the
more discrete Al-O networks and higher concentration of water-soluble Sr-O
species in this compound. Our work significantly facilitates the preparation of
freestanding membranes and sheds light on the integration of multifunctional
perovskite oxides in practical electronic devices.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Transport in a Superfluid Josephson Junction Chain: Is  There Negative Differential Conductivity?</h3>

<i>Samuel E. Begg, Matthew J. Davis, Matthew T. Reeves</i>

We consider the far-from-equilibrium quantum transport dynamics in a 1D
Josephson junction chain of multi-mode Bose-Einstein condensates. We develop a
theoretical model to examine the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 115, 050601 (2015)], wherein the phenomenon of negative differential
conductivity (NDC) was reported in the refilling dynamics of an initially
depleted site within the chain. We demonstrate that a unitary c-field
description can quantitatively reproduce the experimental results over the full
range of tunnel couplings, and requires no fitted parameters. With a view
towards atomtronic implementations, we further demonstrate that the filling is
strongly dependent on spatial phase variations stemming from quantum
fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the interpretation of the device in
terms of NDC is invalid outside of the weak coupling regime. Within this
restricted regime, the device exhibits a hybrid behaviour of NDC and the AC
Josephson effect. A simplified circuit model of the device will require an
approach tailored to atomtronics that incorporates quantum fluctuations.

We explore gauge-independent properties of two-dimensional non-Hermitian
lattice systems with an imaginary magnetic field. We find that the energy
spectrum under the open boundary conditions is an example of such
gauge-independent properties. We discuss how to obtain the asymptotic continuum
energy spectrum upon increasing length of one side using the framework of the
non-Bloch band theory. We also find an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm effect; the
net change of the norm of the wavefunction upon adiabatically forming a closed
path is determined by the imaginary magnetic flux enclosed by the path.

<br>
Bismuth vanadate - bismuth molybdate solid-solution was prepared to elaborate
ceramics with different amounts of cation vacancies. Dense ceramics with
similar microstructures were obtained and the evolution of their melting point,
specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and conductivity as a function of the
amount of vacancy was evaluated. At room temperature, the thermal conductivity
decreases from 1.74 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for BiVO$_{4}$ (x=0) to 1.12 W m$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$ for Bi$_{0.867}$$\square$$_{0.133}$Mo$_{0.4}$V$_{0.6}$O$_{4}$ (x=0.4).
Moreover, we show that a very small amount of vacancy (1.7%, x=0.05) is enough
to provide a large decrease in thermal conductivity by more than 15%, in
agreement with a mass fluctuation scattering model. However, the temperature of
the melting point also decreases with increasing amount of vacancy. Our results
suggest adding only a very small amount of vacancy as the best strategy to
obtain superior materials for thermal barriers and thermoelectric devices, with
ultra-low thermal conductivity and high-temperature stability.

<h3>How do Cicadas Emerge Together? Thermophysical Aspects of Their  Collective Decision-Making</h3>

<br>
<br>
Certain periodical cicadas exhibit life cycles with durations of 13 or 17
years, and it is now generally accepted that such large prime numbers arise
evolutionarily to avoid synchrony with predators. Less well explored is the
question of how, in the face of intrinsic biological and environmental noise,
insects within a brood emerge together in large successive swarms from
underground during springtime warming. Here we consider the decision-making
process of underground cicada nymphs experiencing random but
spatially-correlated thermal microclimates like those in nature. Introducing
short-range communication between insects leads to a model of consensus
building that maps on to the statistical physics of an Ising model with a
quenched, spatially correlated random magnetic field and annealed site
dilution, which displays the kinds of collective swarms seen in nature.

We introduce and formulate the boundary condition twisted by the energy (time
translation) in one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. The stiffness
against this boundary condition quantifies thermal analogues of the Drude
weight and the Meissner stiffness. We apply this formalism to the
one-dimensional quantum XY spin chain and estimate the thermal Meissner
stiffness.

<br>

<br>
<br>
We unveil a hitherto concealed spin-orbit torque mechanism driven by orbital
degrees of freedom in centrosymmetric two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides (focusing on PtSe${}_2$ ). Using first-principles simulations,
tight-binding models and large-scale quantum transport calculations, we show
that such a mechanism fundamentally stems from a spatial localization of
orbital textures at opposite sides of the material, which imprints their
symmetries onto spin-orbit coupling effects, further producing efficient and
tunable spin-orbit torque. Our study suggests that orbital-spin entanglement at
play in centrosymmetric materials can be harnessed as a resource for
outperforming conventional spin-orbit torques generated by the Rashba-type
effects.

We explore the nonlinear response of ultrafast strong-field driven excitons
in a one-dimensional solid with ab initio simulations. We demonstrate from our
simulations and analytical model that a finite population of excitons imprints
unique signatures to the high-harmonic spectra of materials. We show the
exciton population can be retrieved from the spectra. We further demonstrate
signatures of exciton recombination and that a shift of the exciton level is
imprinted into the harmonic signal. The results open the door to high-harmonic
spectroscopy of excitons in condensed-matter systems.

<br>
<br>
We analyze the rectification properties of voltage-biased Josephson junctions
exhibiting the superconducting diode effect. Taking into account multiple
Andreev reflection (MAR) processes in our scattering theory, we consider a
short weak link of arbitrary transparency between two helical superconductors
with finite Cooper pair momentum $2q$. In equilibrium, the diode efficiency is
bounded from above in this model, with maximal efficiency $\eta_0\approx 0.4$.
Out of equilibrium, we find a rich subharmonic structure in the current-voltage
curve. For high transparency and low bias voltage $V$, the rectification
efficiency $\eta(V)$ approaches the ideal value $\eta=1$ for $q\xi\to 1$ (with
coherence length $\xi$).

The strong coherent coupling of quantum emitters to vacuum fluctuations of
the light field offers opportunities for manipulating the optical and transport
properties of nanomaterials, with potential applications ranging from
ultrasensitive all-optical switching to creating polariton condensates. Often,
ubiquitous decoherence processes at ambient conditions limit these couplings to
such short time scales that the quantum dynamics of the interacting system
remains elusive. Prominent examples are strongly coupled exciton-plasmon
systems, which, so far, have mostly been investigated by linear optical
spectroscopy. Here, we use ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to
probe the quantum dynamics of J-aggregate excitons collectively coupled to the
spatially structured plasmonic fields of a gold nanoslit array. We observe rich
coherent Rabi oscillation dynamics reflecting a plasmon-driven coherent exciton
population transfer over mesoscopic distances at room temperature. This opens
up new opportunities to manipulate the coherent transport of matter excitations
by coupling to vacuum fields.

<br>
Spins in semiconductor quantum dots hold great promise as building blocks of
quantum processors. Trapping them in SiMOS transistor-like devices eases future
industrial scale fabrication. Among the potentially scalable readout solutions,
gate-based dispersive radiofrequency reflectometry only requires the already
existing transistor gates to readout a quantum dot state, relieving the need
for additional elements. In this effort towards scalability, traveling-wave
superconducting parametric amplifiers significantly enhance the readout
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by reducing the noise below typical cryogenic
low-noise amplifiers, while offering a broad amplification band, essential to
multiplex the readout of multiple resonators. In this work, we demonstrate a
3GHz gate-based reflectometry readout of electron charge states trapped in
quantum dots formed in SiMOS multi-gate devices, with SNR enhanced thanks to a
Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA). The broad, tunable 2GHz
amplification bandwidth combined with more than 10dB ON/OFF SNR improvement of
the JTWPA enables frequency and time division multiplexed readout of interdot
transitions, and noise performance near the quantum limit. In addition, owing
to a design without superconducting loops and with a metallic ground plane, the
JTWPA is flux insensitive and shows stable performances up to a magnetic field
of 1.2T at the quantum dot device, compatible with standard SiMOS spin qubit
experiments.

<h3>The rule of four: anomalous stoichiometries of inorganic compounds</h3>

<br>
<br>
Why are materials with specific characteristics more abundant than others?
This is a fundamental question in materials science and one that is
traditionally difficult to tackle, given the vastness of compositional and
configurational space. We highlight here the anomalous abundance of inorganic
compounds whose primitive unit cell contains a number of atoms that is a
multiple of four. This occurrence - named here the 'rule of four' - has to our
knowledge not previously been reported or studied. Here, we first highlight the
rule's existence, especially notable when restricting oneself to experimentally
known compounds, and explore its possible relationship with established
descriptors of crystal structures, from symmetries to energies. We then
investigate this relative abundance by looking at structural descriptors, both
of global (packing configurations) and local (the smooth overlap of atomic
positions) nature. Contrary to intuition, the overabundance does not correlate
with low-energy or high-symmetry structures; in fact, structures which obey the
'rule of four' are characterized by low symmetries and loosely packed
arrangements maximizing the free volume. We are able to correlate this
abundance with local structural symmetries, and visualize the results using a
hybrid supervised-unsupervised machine learning method.

<h3>Real-space topological localizer index to fully characterize the  dislocation skin effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
The dislocation skin effect exhibits the capacity of topological defects to
trap an extensive number of modes in two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.
Similar to the corresponding skin effects caused by system boundaries, this
phenomenon also originates from nontrivial topology. However, finding the
relationship between the dislocation skin effect and nonzero topological
invariants, especially in disordered systems, can be obscure and challenging.
Here, we introduce a real-space topological invariant based on the spectral
localizer to characterize the skin effect on two-dimensional lattices. We
demonstrate that this invariant consistently predicts the occurrence and
location of both boundary and dislocation skin effects, offering a unified
approach applicable to both ordered and disordered systems. Our work
demonstrates a general approach that can be utilized to diagnose the
topological nature of various types of skin effects, particularly in the
absence of translational symmetry when momentum-space descriptions are
inapplicable.

<h3>Ordering properties of anisotropic hard bodies in one-dimensional  channels</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The phase behavior and structural properties of hard anisotropic particles
(prisms and dumbbells) are examined in one-dimensional channels using the
Parsons--Lee (PL) theory, and the transfer-matrix and neighbor-distribution
methods. The particles are allowed to move freely along the channel, while
their orientations are constrained such that one particle can occupy only two
or three different lengths along the channel. In this confinement setting, hard
prisms behave as an additive mixture, while hard dumbbells behave as a
non-additive one. We prove that all methods provide exact results for the phase
properties of hard prisms, while only the neighbor-distribution and
transfer-matrix methods are exact for hard dumbbells. This shows that
non-additive effects are incorrectly included into the PL theory, which is a
successful theory of the isotropic-nematic phase transition of rod-like
particles in higher dimensions. In the one-dimensional channel, the
orientational ordering develops continuously with increasing density, i.e., the
system is isotropic only at zero density, while it becomes perfectly ordered at
the close-packing density. We show that there is no orientational correlation
in the hard prism system, while the hard dumbbells are orientationally
correlated with diverging correlation length at close packing. On the other
hand, positional correlations are present for all the systems, the associated
correlation length diverging at close packing.

<h3>Emerging topological bound states in Haldane model zigzag nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<i>Simone Traverso, Maura Sassetti, Niccolò Traverso Ziani</i>
<br>
<br>
Zigzag nanoribbons hosting the Haldane Chern insulator model are considered.
In this context, an unreported reentrant topological phase, characterized by
the emergence of quasi zero dimensional in-gap states, is discussed. The bound
states, which reside in the gap opened by the hybridization of the
counter-propagating edge modes of the Haldane phase, are localized at the ends
of the strip and are found to be robust against on-site disorder. These
findings are supported by the behavior of the Zak phase over the parameter
space, which exhibits jumps of $\pi$ in correspondence to the phase transitions
between the trivial and the non-trivial phases. Setups with non-uniform
parameters also show topological bound states via the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism.
All the properties reported are shown to be extremely sensitive to the strip
width.

<h3>Towards quantitative precision in ultracold atoms with functional  renormalisation</h3>

<br>
<br>
We compute the equation of state, the gap as well as the density fluctuations
of a two-component superfluid Fermi gas over the whole range of BEC-BCS
crossover at vanishing temperature within the functional renormalisation group
approach. With an improved understanding of the relation between density and
chemical potential, already a rather simple truncation yields a very good
quantitative agreement with experimental data and theoretical results, in
particular in the unitarity limit and on the BEC side. The current approach
utilises higher order density fluctuations as a fundamental building block for
the computation of the density as a function of the chemical potential. This
circumvents the fine-tuning problem of the density-related fundamental
parameters on the microscopic level that has been observed in previous
approaches. The quantitative reliability of the functional renormalisation
group approach already within simple approximations opens the path towards
precision results in more elaborate truncations.

<i>Natalya S. Fedorova, Dmitri E. Nikonov, John M. Mangeri, Hai Li, Ian A. Young, Jorge Íñiguez</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we use a phenomenological theory of ferroelectric switching in
BiFeO$_3$ thin films to uncover the mechanism of the two-step process that
leads to the reversal of the weak magnetization of these materials. First, we
introduce a realistic model of a BiFeO$_3$ film, including the Landau energy of
isolated domains as well as the constraints that account for the presence of
the substrate and the multidomain configuration found experimentally. We use
this model to obtain statistical information about the switching behavior - by
running dynamical simulations based on the Landau-Khalatnikov time-evolution
equation, including thermal fluctuations - and we thus identify the factors
that drive the two-step polarization reversal observed in the experiments.
Additionally, we apply our model to test potential strategies for optimizing
the switching characteristics.

<h3>Solid lubrication by wet-transferred solution-processed graphene flakes:  dissipation mechanisms and superlubricity in mesoscale contacts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14813</a>

<i>Renato Buzio, Andrea Gerbi, Cristina Bernini, Luca Repetto, Andrea Silva, Andrea Vanossi</i>
<br>
<br>
Solution-processed few-layers graphene flakes, dispensed to rotating and
sliding contacts via liquid dispersions, are gaining increasing attention as
friction modifiers to achieve low friction and wear at technologically-relevant
interfaces. Vanishing friction states, i.e. superlubricity, have been
documented for nearly-ideal nanoscale contacts lubricated by individual
graphene flakes; there is however no clear understanding if superlubricity
might persist for larger and morphologically-disordered contacts, as those
typically obtained by graphene wet transfer from a liquid dispersion. In this
study we address the friction performance of solution-processed graphene flakes
by means of colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy. We use an additive-free
aqueous dispersion to coat micrometric silica beads, which are then sled under
ambient conditions against prototypical material substrates, namely graphite
and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MoS2 and WS2. High resolution
microscopy proves that the random assembly of the wet-transferred flakes over
the silica probes results into an inhomogeneous coating, formed by graphene
patches that control contact mechanics through tens-of-nanometers tall
protrusions. Atomic-scale friction force spectroscopy reveals that dissipation
proceeds via stick-slip instabilities. Load-controlled transitions from
dissipative stick-slip to superlubric continuous sliding may occur for the
graphene-graphite homojunctions, whereas single- and multiple-slips dissipative
dynamics characterizes the graphene-TMD heterojunctions. Systematic numerical
simulations demonstrate that the thermally-activated single-asperity
Prandtl-Tomlinson model comprehensively describes friction experiments
involving different graphene-coated colloidal probes, material substrates and
sliding regimes.

<br>
Recently signatures of superconductivity were observed close to 80 K in
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure [1]. This discovery positions
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as the first bulk nickelate with high-temperature
superconductivity, but the lack of zero resistance presents a significant
drawback for validating the findings. Here we show that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$
exhibits zero resistance upon applying hydrostatic pressure up to 29.2~GPa
using a liquid pressure medium. We find that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ remains
metallic under applied pressures, suggesting the absence of a metal-insulator
transition proximate to the superconductivity. Analysis of the normal state
$T$-linear resistance suggests an intricate link between this strange metal
behaviour and superconductivity, whereby at high pressures both the linear
resistance coefficient and superconducting transition are slowly suppressed by
pressure, while at intermediate pressures both the superconductivity and
strange metal behaviour appear disrupted, possibly due to a nearby structural
instability. The association between strange metal behaviour and
high-temperature superconductivity is very much in line with diverse classes of
unconventional superconductors, including the cuprates and iron-pnictides
[2-6]. Understanding the superconductivity of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ evidently
requires further revealing the interplay of strange metal behaviour,
superconductivity, as well as possible competing electronic or structural
phases.

<h3>Frustration-Induced Superconductivity in the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard Model</h3>

<br>
<i>Changkai Zhang, Jheng-Wei Li, Jan von Delft</i>
<br>
<br>
The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to capture key
ingredients of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprate materials. However,
compelling evidence remains elusive. In particular, various magnetic orders may
emerge as strong competitors of superconducting orders. Here, we study the
ground state properties of the doped 2D $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model on a square
lattice via the infinite Projected Entangled-Pair State (iPEPS) method with
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ or $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin symmetry. The former is compatible
with antiferromagnetic orders, while the latter forbids them. Therefore, we
obtain by comparison a detailed understanding of the magnetic impact on
superconductivity. Moreover, an additional $t'$ term accommodates the
particle-hole asymmetry, which facilitates studies on the discrepancies between
electron- and hole-doped systems. We demonstrate that (i) a positive $t'/t$
significantly amplifies the strength of superconducting orders; (ii) at
sufficiently large doping levels, the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model favors a uniform
state with superconducting orders instead of stripe states with charge and spin
modulations; and (iii) the enhancement of magnetic frustration, by increasing
either the strength of NNN interactions or the charge doping, impairs stripe
orders and helps stabilize superconductivity.

The ferromagnetic metal-superconductor heterostructure with interface Rashba
spin-orbit hopping is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity.
We study the interplay between the interface Rashba hopping and the intrinsic
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in this heterostructure, and demonstrate rich
topological phases with five distinct Chern numbers. In particular, we find a
topological state with a Chern number as large as four in the parameter space
of the heterostructure. We calculate the Berry curvatures that construct the
Chern numbers, and show that these Berry curvatures induce anomalous thermal
Hall transport of the superconducting quasiparticles. We reveal chiral edge
states in the topological phases, as well as helical edge states in the trivial
phase, and show that the wave functions of these edge states mostly concentrate
on the ferrometal layer of the heterostructure.

<br>
<br>
We study the motion of a hole with internal degrees of freedom, introduced to
the zigzag magnetic ground state of Na$_2$IrO$_3$, by using the self-consistent
Born approximation. We find that the low, intermediate, and high-energy spectra
are primarily attributed to the singlet, triplet, and quintet hole
contributions, respectively. The spectral functions exhibit distinct features
such as the electron-like dispersion of low-energy states near the $\Gamma$
point, the maximum M-point intensity of mid-energy states, and the hole-like
dispersion of high-energy states. These features are robust and almost
insensitive to the exchange model and Hund's coupling, and are in qualitative
agreement with the angular-resolved photoemission spectra observed in
Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Our results reveal that the interference between internal
degrees of freedom in different sublattices plays an important role in inducing
the complex dispersions.

<br>
<br>
The intrinsically superconducting Dirac semimetal 2M-WS$_{2}$ is a promising
candidate to realize proximity-induced topological superconductivity in its
protected surface states. A precise characterization of the bulk
superconducting state is essential for understanding the nature of surface
superconductivity in the system. Here, we perform a detailed experimental study
of the temperature and nonmagnetic disorder dependence of the London
penetration depth $\lambda$, the upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in 2M-WS$_{2}$. We observe a
power-law dependence $\lambda(T) - \lambda(0) \propto T^{3}$ at temperatures
below $0.35~T_c$, which is remarkably different from the expected exponential
attenuation of a fully gapped isotropic $s$-wave superconductor. We then probe
the effect of controlled nonmagnetic disorder induced by 2.5 MeV electron
irradiation at various doses and find a significant $T_c$ suppression rate.
Together with the observed increase of the slope $dH_{c2}/dT|_{T=T_c}$ with
irradiation, our results reveal a strongly anisotropic $s^{++}$ multiband
superconducting state that takes the same sign on different Fermi sheets. Our
results have direct consequences for the expected proximity-induced
superconductivity of the topological surface states.

<h3>Reduced stress propagation leads to increased mechanical failure  resistance in auxetic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14914</a>
<br>
<i>Suzanne M. Fielding</i>
<br>
<br>
Materials with negative Poisson ratio have the counter-intuitive property of
expanding laterally when they are stretched longitudinally. They are
accordingly termed auxetic, from the Greek auxesis meaning to increase.
Experimental studies have demonstrated auxetic materials to have superior
material properties, compared with conventional ones. These include synclastic
curvature, increased acoustic absorption, increased resilience to material
fatigue, and increased resistance to mechanical failure. Until now, the latter
observations have remained poorly understood theoretically. With this
motivation, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we elucidate
analytically the way in which stress propagates spatially across a material
following a localised plastic failure event, finding a significantly reduced
stress propagation in auxetic materials compared with conventional ones. In
this way, a plastic failure event occurring in one part of a material has a
reduced tendency to trigger knock-on plastic events in neighbouring regions.
Second, via the numerical simulation of a lattice elastoplastic model, we
demonstrate a key consequence of this reduced stress propagation to be an
increased resistance to mechanical failure. This is seen not only via an
increase in the externally measured yield strain, but also via a decreased
tendency for plastic damage to percolate internally across a sample in
catastrophic system-spanning clusters.

<h3>Viscoelastic confinement induces periodic flow reversals in active  nematics</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use linear stability analysis and hybrid lattice Boltzmann simulations to
study the dynamical behaviour of an active nematic confined in a channel made
of viscoelastic material. We find that the quiescent, ordered active nematic is
unstable above a critical activity. The transition is to a steady flow state
for high elasticity of the channel surroundings. However, below a threshold
elastic modulus, the system produces spontaneous oscillations with periodic
flow reversals. We provide a phase diagram that highlights the region where
time-periodic oscillations are observed and explain how they are produced by
the interplay of activity and viscoelasticity. Our results suggest new
experiments to study the role of viscoelastic confinement in the
spatio-temporal organization and control of active matter.

The combination of multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and phase
imprinting techniques provides an ideal platform for exploring nonlinear
dynamics and investigating the quantum transport properties of superfluids. In
this paper, we study abundant density structures and corresponding dynamics of
phase-separated binary Bose-Einstein condensates with phase-imprinted single
vortex or vortex dipole. By adjusting the ratio between the interspecies and
intraspecies interactions, and the locations of the phase singularities, the
typical density profiles such as ball-shell structures, crescent-gibbous
structures, Matryoshka-like structures, sector-sector structures and
sandwich-type structures appear, and the phase diagrams are obtained. The
dynamics of these structures exhibit diverse properties, including the
penetration of vortex dipoles, emergence of half-vortex dipoles, co-rotation of
sectors, and oscillation between sectors. The pinning effects induced by a
potential defect are also discussed, which is useful for controlling and
manipulating individual quantum states.

Disclinations or disclination clusters in smectic C freely suspended films
with topological charges larger than one are unstable. They disintegrate,
preferably in a spatially symmetric fashion, into single defects with
individual charges +1, which is the smallest positive topological charge
allowed in polar vector fields. While the opposite process of defect
annihilation is well-defined by the initial defect positions, a disintegration
starts from a singular state and the following scenario including the emerging
regular defect patterns must be selected by specific mechanisms. We analyze
experimental data and compare them with a simple model where the defect
clusters adiabatically pass quasi-equilibrium solutions in one-constant
approximation. It is found that the defects arrange in geometrical patterns
that correspond very closely to superimposed singular defect solutions, without
additional director distortions. The patterns expand by affine transformations
where all distances between individual defects scale with the same
time-dependent scaling factor proportional to the square-root of time.

<h3>Large-scale universality in Quantum Reaction-Diffusion from Keldysh  field theory</h3>

<br>

We consider the quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics in $d$ spatial dimensions
of a Fermi gas subject to binary annihilation reactions $A+A \to \emptyset$.
These systems display collective nonequilibrium long-time behavior, which is
signalled by an algebraic decay of the particle density. Building on the
Keldysh formalism, we devise a field theoretical approach for the
reaction-limited regime, where annihilation reactions are scarce. By means of a
perturbative expansion of the dissipative interaction, we derive a description
in terms of a large-scale universal kinetic equation. Our approach shows how
the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble assumption, which is often
employed for treating low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, emerges from
systematic diagrammatics. It also allows to exactly compute -- for arbitrary
spatial dimension -- the decay exponent of the particle density. The latter is
based on the large-scale description of the quantum dynamics and it differs
from the mean-field prediction even in dimension larger than one. We moreover
consider spatially inhomogeneous setups involving an external potential. In
confined systems the density decay is accelerated towards the mean-field
algebraic behavior, while for deconfined scenarios the power-law decay is
replaced by a slower non-algebraic decay.

<br>
<br>
We present a method to probe the topological properties of a circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) array described through a Haldane model on the honeycomb
lattice. We develop the theory of microwave light propagating in a local probe
or a microscope (a one-dimensional transmission line) capacitively coupled to
the topological cQED lattice model. Interestingly, we show that even if the
microwave light has no transverse polarization, the measured reflection
coefficient, resolved in frequency through the resonance, allows us to reveal
the geometrical properties and topological phase transition associated to the
model. This spectroscopy tool developed for cQED lattice models reveals the
same topological information as circularly polarized light, locally within the
Brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, our findings hold
significance for topological magnon systems and are a priori applicable to all
Chern insulators, presenting an intriguing opportunity for their adaptation to
other systems with different particle statistics.

<h3>Interlayer coupling driven high-temperature superconductivity in  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14965" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14965</a>

<i>Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
The newly discovered high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
under pressure has attracted a great deal of interests. The essential
ingredient characterizing the electronic properties is the bilayer NiO$_2$
planes, in which the two layers couple with each other from the bonding of
Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital through the intermediate oxygen-atoms. In the strong
coupling limit, an intralayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction
$J_{\parallel}$ between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and an interlayer one
$J_{\perp}$ between $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals are generated. Taking into account the
Hund's rule at each site and integrating out the $3d_{z^2}$ spin of freedom,
the system reduces to a single-orbital bilayer $t$-$J$ model of the
$3d_{x^2-y^2}$. Based on the slave-boson approach, the self-consistent equation
for the hopping and pairing order parameters is solved. Near the relevant
$\frac{1}{4}$-filling regime (doping $\delta=0.3\sim 0.5$), the inter-layer
coupling $J_{\perp}$ tunes the conventional single-layer $d$-wave
superconducting state to the $s$-wave one. A strong $J_{\perp}$ could enhance
the intra-layer superconducting order, leading to a dramatically increased
$T_c$. Interestingly, there could exist a finite regime in which an $s+id$
state emerges.

Identifying a suitable water-soluble sacrificial layer is crucial to
fabricating large-scale freestanding oxide membranes, which stimulates
intriguing functionalities and enables novel integrations with semiconductor
technologies. In this work, we introduce a new water-soluble sacrificial layer,
"super-tetragonal" Sr4Al2O7 (SAOT). Its unique atomic structure ensures a
coherent growth of perovskite ABO3/SAOT heterostructures, effectively
inhibiting crack formation in the water-released membranes. For various
non-ferroelectric oxide membranes with lattice constants ranging from 3.85 to
4.04 A, the crack-free areas can span up to millimeter-scale. The high
water-solubility of SAOT shortens the exfoliation duration to a few minutes
only. Our findings highlight the SAOT as an effective and versatile sacrificial
layer for freestanding oxide membranes with superior integrity, crystallinity,
and functionalities, further promoting their potential for innovative device
applications.

<h3>Mechanism of pressure sensitive adhesion in nematic elastomers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nematic liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have anomalously high vibration
damping, and it has been assumed this is the cause of their anomalously high
pressure-sensitive adhesion (PSA). Here we investigate the mechanism behind
this enhanced PSA by first preparing thin adhesive tapes with LCE of varying
crosslinking density, characterizing their material and surface properties, and
then studying the adhesion characteristics with a standard set of 90-deg peel,
lap shear, and probe tack tests. The study confirms that the enhanced PSA is
only present in (and due to) the nematic phase of the elastomer, and the
strength of bonding takes over 24 hours to fully reach its maximum value. Such
a long saturation time is caused by the slow relaxation of local stress and
director orientation in nematic domains after pressing against the surface. We
confirm this mechanism by showing that a freshly pressed and annealed tape
reaches the same maximum bonding strength on cooling, when the returning
nematic order is forming in its optimal configuration in the pressed film.

<h3>Higher-order Topological Insulators and Semimetals in Three Dimensions  without Crystalline Counterparts</h3>

Quasicrystals allow for symmetries that are impossible in crystalline
materials, such as eight-fold rotational symmetry, enabling the existence of
novel higher-order topological insulators in two dimensions without crystalline
counterparts. However, it remains an open question whether three-dimensional
higher-order topological insulators and Weyl-like semimetals without
crystalline counterparts can exist. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a
second-order topological insulator by constructing and exploring a
three-dimensional model Hamiltonian in a stack of Ammann-Beenker tiling
quasicrystalline lattices. The topological phase has eight chiral hinge modes
that lead to quantized longitudinal conductances of $4 e^2/h$. We show that the
topological phase is characterized by the winding number of the quadrupole
moment. We further establish the existence of a second-order topological
insulator with time-reversal symmetry, characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological invariant. Finally, we propose a model that exhibits a higher-order
Weyl-like semimetal phase, demonstrating both hinge and surface Fermi arcs. Our
findings highlight that quasicrystals in three dimensions can give rise to
higher-order topological insulators and semimetal phases that are unattainable
in crystals.

<h3>A chemical reaction network implementation of a Maxwell demon</h3>

<br>

We study an autonomous model of a Maxwell demon that works by rectifying
thermal fluctuations of chemical reactions. It constitutes the chemical analog
of a recently studied electronic demon. We characterize its scaling behavior in
the macroscopic limit, its performances, and the impact of potential internal
delays. We obtain analytical expressions for all quantities of interest,
namely, the generated reverse chemical current, the output power, the
transduction efficiency, and the correlations between the numbers of molecules.
Due to a bound on the nonequilibrium response of its chemical reaction network,
we find that, contrary to the electronic case, there is no way for the Maxwell
demon to generate a finite output in the macroscopic limit. Finally, we analyze
the information thermodynamics of the Maxwell demon from a bipartite
perspective. In the limit of a fast demon, the information flow is obtained,
its pattern in the state space is discussed, and the behavior of the partial
efficiencies related to the measurement and the feedback processes is examined.

<h3>Unpinned Dirac-Fermions in Carbon-Phosphorous-Arsenic Based Ternary  Monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15001" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15001</a>
<br>
<i>Amrendra Kumar, C. Kamal</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict energetically and dynamically stable ternary
Carbon-Phosphorous-Arsenic (CPAs2) monolayers in buckled geometric structure by
employing density functional theory based calculations. We consider three
different symmetric configurations, namely, inversion (i), mirror (m) and
rotational (r). The low-energy dispersions in electronic band structure and
density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level contain two contrasting
features: (a) parabolic dispersion around highly symmetric Gamma point with a
step function in DOS due to nearly-free-particle-like Schroedinger-Fermions and
(b) linear dispersion around highly symmetric K point with linear DOS due to
massless Dirac-Fermions for i-CPAs2 monolayer. The step function in DOS is a
consequence of two-dimensionality of the system in which the motion of
nearly-free-particles is confined. However, a closer look at (b) reveals that
the ternary monolayers possess distinct characters, namely (i)
massless-gapless, (ii) slightly massive-gapped and (iii) unpinned
massless-gapless Dirac-Fermions for i, m and r-CPAs2 configurations
respectively. Thus, the nature of states around the Fermi level depends
crucially on the symmetry of systems. In addition, we probe the influence of
mechanical strain on the properties of CPAs2 monolayer. The results indicate
that the characteristic dispersions of (a) and (b) move in opposite directions
in energy which leads to a metal-to-semimetal transition in i and r-CPAs2
configurations, for a few percentages of tensile strain. On the other hand, a
strain induced metal-to-semiconductor transition is observed in m-CPAs2
configuration with a tunable energy band gap. Interestingly, unlike graphene,
the Dirac cones can be unpinned from highly symmetric K (and K') point, but
they are restricted to move along the edges (K-M'-K') of first Brillouin zone
due to C2 symmetry in i and r-CPAs2 configurations.

We present PolyHoop, a lightweight standalone C++ implementation of a
mechanical model to simulate the dynamics of soft particles and cellular
tissues in two dimensions. With only few geometrical and physical parameters,
PolyHoop is capable of simulating a wide range of particulate soft matter
systems: from biological cells and tissues to vesicles, bubbles, foams,
emulsions, and other amorphous materials. The soft particles or cells are
represented by continuously remodeling, non-convex, high-resolution polygons
that can undergo growth, division, fusion, aggregation, and separation. With
PolyHoop, a tissue or foam consisting of a million cells with high spatial
resolution can be simulated on conventional laptop computers.

<h3>Harnessing Synthetic Active Particles for Physical Reservoir Computing</h3>

The processing of information is an indispensable property of living systems
realized by networks of active processes with enormous complexity. They have
inspired many variants of modern machine learning one of them being reservoir
computing, in which stimulating a network of nodes with fading memory enables
computations and complex predictions. Reservoirs are implemented on computer
hardware, but also on unconventional physical substrates such as mechanical
oscillators, spins, or bacteria often summarized as physical reservoir
computing. Here we demonstrate physical reservoir computing with a synthetic
active microparticle system that self-organizes from an active and passive
component into inherently noisy nonlinear dynamical units. The
self-organization and dynamical response of the unit is the result of a delayed
propulsion of the microswimmer to a passive target. A reservoir of such units
with a self-coupling via the delayed response can perform predictive tasks
despite the strong noise resulting from Brownian motion of the microswimmers.
To achieve efficient noise suppression, we introduce a special architecture
that uses historical reservoir states for output. Our results pave the way for
the study of information processing in synthetic self-organized active particle
systems.

<h3>A unified picture of continuous variation of critical exponents</h3>

<i>Indranil Mukherjee, P. K. Mohanty</i>

Renormalization group (RG) theory allows continuous variation of critical
exponents along a marginal direction (if any) but does not predict the
functional form. Recently it was proposed that continuous variation must occur
in a way that leaves scaling relations invariant. For magnetic phase
transition, the variation can occur in three different ways: I. $\gamma$ varies
keeping $\delta$ fixed, II. $\delta$ varies keeping $\gamma$ fixed and III.
both $\delta$ and $\gamma$ vary. In this article, we study the isotropic Ashkin
Teller model on a two-dimensional square lattice and show that the magnetic and
electric phase transition along the self-dual line exhibit continuous variation
of critical exponents which are of Type-I (formally known as weak universality)
and Type-III respectively. We show that the scaling functions of both electric
and magnetic phase transition are only a scaled version of the universal
scaling function of the Ising universality class in two dimensions.

Dense bacterial suspensions display collective motion exhibiting coherent
flow structures reminiscent of turbulent flows. In contrast to inertial
turbulence, understanding the microscopic dynamics of bacterial fluid elements
undergoing collective motion is in its incipient stages. Here, we report
experiments revealing correlations between the microscopic dynamics and the
emergence of collective motion in bacterial suspensions. Our detailed analysis
of the passive tracers and the velocity field of the bacterial suspensions
allowed us to systematically correlate the Lagrangian and the Eulerian
perspectives. Bacteria within the collective dynamics revealed initial
ballistic dynamics followed by intermittent L\'evy walk before the eventual
decay to random Gaussian fluctuations. Intriguingly, the persistence length and
time of the fluid motion decrease with an increase in the activity, which, in
turn, reduces the duration of L\'evy walk. Our results reveal transitions in
microscopic dynamics underlying the bacterial turbulence and their control via
the intrinsic time scales set by the effective activity of the flow.

<h3>Vibrations and Heat Transfer in Glasses: the role played by Disorder</h3>

Amorphous materials are also distinguished from crystals by their thermal
properties. The structural disorder seems to be responsible both for a
significant increase in heat capacity compared to crystals of the same
composition, but also for a significant decrease in thermal conductivity. The
temperature dependence of thermal conductivity, unusual for common
interpretations of solid-state physics, gave rise to a lot of debates. We
review in this article different interpretations of thermal conductivity in
amorphous materials. We show finally that the temperature dependence of thermal
conductivity in dielectric materials can be understood by relating it to the
disorder-dependent harmonic vibrational eigenmodes.

<h3>Probing the large deviations for the Beta random walk in random medium</h3>

<br>

We consider a discrete-time random walk on a one-dimensional lattice with
space and time-dependent random jump probabilities, known as the Beta random
walk. We are interested in the probability that, for a given realization of the
jump probabilities (a sample), a walker starting at the origin at time $t=0$ is
at position beyond $\xi \sqrt{T/2}$ at time $T$. This probability fluctuates
from sample to sample and we study the large-deviation rate function which
characterizes the tails of its distribution at large time $T \gg 1$. It is
argued that, up to a simple rescaling, this rate function is identical to the
one recently obtained exactly by two of the authors for the continuum version
of the model. That continuum model also appears in the macroscopic fluctuation
theory of a class of lattice gases, e.g. in the so-called KMP model of heat
transfer. An extensive numerical simulation of the Beta random walk, based on
an importance sampling algorithm, is found in good agreement with the detailed
analytical predictions. A first-order transition in the tilted measure,
predicted to occur in the continuum model, is also observed in the numerics.
