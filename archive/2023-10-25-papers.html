<h3>Field-Theory of Active Chiral Hard Disks: A First-Principles Approach to  Steric Interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16691" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16691</a>
<br>
<i>Erik Kalz, Abhinav Sharma, Ralf Metzler</i>
<br>
<br>
A first-principles approach for active chiral hard disks is presented, that
explicitly accounts for steric interactions on the two-body level. We derive an
effective one-body equation for the joint probability distribution of positions
and angles of the particles. By projecting on the angular modes, we write a
hierarchy for the lowest hydrodynamic modes, i.e. particle density,
polarization, and nematic tensor. By undimensionalising the equations, we
highlight the assumptions, which - though inherent - are often included
implicit in closing the hierarchy for finally arriving at an effective
field-theoretical equation for the particle density. By considering different
regimes of the P{\'e}clet number, the well-known models in active matter can be
obtained through our conisderation. Explicitly, we derive the phenomenological
Model B and by going to higher orders in the closure scheme, we show that this
first-principles approach results in the recently introduced Active Model B +,
a natural extension of the Model B for active processes. Remarkably, here we
find that chirality can change the sign of the phenomonological activity
parameters.

<h3>CDMFT+HFD : an extension of dynamical mean field theory for nonlocal  interactions applied to the single band extended Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16075</a>
<br>
<i>Sarbajaya Kundu, David Sénéchal</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model on a square
lattice, for both attractive and repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions, using
CDMFT+HFD, a combination of Cluster Dynamical Mean Field theory (CDMFT) and a
Hartree-Fock mean-field decoupling of the inter-cluster extended interaction.
For attractive non-local interactions, this model exhibits a region of phase
separation near half-filling, in the vicinity of which we find pockets of
d-wave superconductivity, decaying rapidly as a function of doping, with
disconnected patches of extended s-wave order at smaller (higher) electron
densities. On the other hand, when the extended interaction is repulsive, a
Mott insulating state at half-filling is destabilized by hole doping, in the
strong-coupling limit, in favor of d-wave superconductivity. At the
particle-hole invariant chemical potential, we find a first-order phase
transition from antiferromagnetism (AF) to d-wave superconductivity as a
function of the attractive nearest-neighbor interaction, along with a deviation
of the density from the half-filled limit. A repulsive extended interaction
instead favors charge-density wave (CDW) order at half-filling.

<h3>Disorder effects in spiral spin liquids: Long-range spin textures,  Friedel-like oscillations, and spiral spin glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16080</a>

Spiral spin liquids are correlated states of matter in which a frustrated
magnetic system evades order by fluctuating between a set of (nearly)
degenerate spin spirals. Here, we investigate the response of spiral spin
liquids to quenched disorder in a $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg
model. At the single-impurity level, we identify different
order-by-quenched-disorder phenomena and analyze the ensuing spin textures. In
particular, we show that the latter generally display Friedel-like
oscillations, which encode direct information about the spiral contour, i.e.,
the classical ground-state manifold. At finite defect concentrations, we
perform extensive numerical simulations and characterize the resulting phases
at zero temperature. As a result, we find that the competition between
incompatible order-by-quenched-disorder mechanisms can lead to spiral spin
glass states already at low to moderate disorder. Finally, we discuss
extensions of our conclusions to nonzero temperatures and higher-dimensional
systems, as well as their applications to experiments.

<h3>Gauged cooling of topological excitations and emergent fermions on  quantum simulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16082</a>

Simulated cooling is a robust method for preparing low-energy states of
many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum simulators. In such schemes, a
subset of the simulator's spins (or qubits) are treated as a "bath," which
extracts energy and entropy from the system of interest. However, such
protocols are inefficient when applied to systems whose excitations are highly
non-local in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom, such as topological
phases of matter; such excitations are difficult to extract by a local coupling
to a bath. We explore a route to overcome this obstacle by encoding of the
system's degrees of freedom into those of the quantum simulator in a non-local
manner. To illustrate the approach, we show how to efficiently cool the
ferromagnetic phase of the quantum Ising model, whose excitations are domain
walls, via a "gauged cooling" protocol in which the Ising spins are coupled to
a $Z_2$ gauge field that simultaneously acts as a reservoir for removing
excitations. We show that our protocol can prepare the ground states of the
ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases equally efficiently. The gauged cooling
protocol naturally extends to (interacting) fermionic systems, where it is
equivalent to cooling by coupling to a fermionic bath via single-fermion
hopping.

<h3>Dynamical Spectral Response of Fractonic Quantum Matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16084" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16084</a>

<br>
Quantum many-body systems with fractonic excitations can realize fascinating
phases of matter. Here, we study the low-energy excitations of a constrained
Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension, which conserves the center of mass or,
equivalently, the dipole moment in addition to the particle number. This model
is known to realize fractonic phases, including a dipole Mott insulator, a
dipole Luttinger liquid, and a metastable dipole supersolid. We use tensor
network methods to compute spectral functions from the dynamical response of
the system and verify predictions from low-energy field theories of the
corresponding ground state phases. We demonstrate the existence of gapped
excitations compatible with strong coupling results in a dipole Mott insulator,
linear sound modes characteristic of a Luttinger liquid of dipoles, and soft
quadratic modes at both zero and finite momenta in a supersolid state with
charge density wave order and phase coherence at non-integer filling.

<h3>Long-range entanglement and topological excitations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological order comes in different forms, and its classification and
detection is an important field of modern research. In this work, we show that
the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy, a measure originally introduced to
identify topological phases, is also able to unveil the long-range entanglement
(LRE) carried by a single, fractionalized excitation. We show this by
considering a quantum, delocalized domain wall excitation that can be
introduced into a system by inducing topological frustration in an
antiferromagnetic spin chain. Furthermore, we study the resilience of LRE
against a quantum quench and the introduction of disorder, thus establishing
the existence of a phase with topological features despite not being a typical
topological order or symmetry-protected one.

<h3>Kekulé spirals and charge transfer cascades in twisted symmetric  trilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16094</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the phase diagram of magic-angle twisted symmetric trilayer graphene
in the presence of uniaxial heterostrain and interlayer displacement field. For
experimentally reasonable strain, our mean-field analysis finds robust Kekul\'e
spiral order whose doping-dependent ordering vector is incommensurate with the
moir\'e superlattice, consistent with recent scanning tunneling microscopy
experiments, and paralleling the behaviour of closely-related twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) systems. Strikingly, we identify a new possibility absent in
TBG: the existence of $\textit{commensurate}$ Kekul\'e spiral order even at
zero strain for experimentally realistic values of the interlayer potential in
a trilayer. Our studies also reveal a complex pattern of charge transfer
between weakly- and strongly-dispersive bands in strained trilayer samples as
the density is tuned by electrostatic gating, that can be understood
intuitively in terms of the `cascades' in the compressibility of magic-angle
TBG.

<h3>Bounding the approach to oligarchy in a variant of the yard-sale model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16098" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16098</a>
<br>
<i>David W. Cohen, Bruce M. Boghosian</i>
<br>
<br>
We present analytical results for the Gini coefficient of economic inequality
under the dynamics of a modified Yard-Sale Model of kinetic asset exchange. A
variant of the Yard-Sale Model is introduced by modifying the underlying binary
transaction of the classical system. It is shown that the Gini coefficient is
monotone under the resulting dynamics but the approach to oligarchy, as
measured by the Gini index, can be bounded by a first-order differential
inequality used in conjunction with the differential Gronwall inequality. The
asymptotics of the modified system, with a redistributive tax, are derived and
shown to agree with the original, taxed Yard-Sale Model, which implies the
modified system is as suitable for matching real wealth distributions.

<h3>Granular packing simulation protocols: tap, press and relax</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16114" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16114</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Granular matter takes many paths to pack. Gentle compression, compaction or
repetitive tapping can happen in natural and industrial processes. The path
influences the packing microstructure, and thus macroscale properties,
particularly for frictional grains. We perform discrete element modeling
simulations to construct packings of frictional spheres implementing a range of
stress-controlled protocols with 3D periodic boundary conditions. A
volume-controlled over-compression method is compared to four stress-controlled
methods, including over-compression and release, gentle under-compression and
cyclical compression and release. The packing volume fraction of each method
depends on the pressure, initial kinetic energy and protocol parameters. A
non-monotonic pressure dependence in the volume fraction, but not the
coordination number occurs when dilute particles initialized with a non-zero
kinetic energy are compressed, but can be reduced with the inclusion of drag.
The fraction of frictional contacts correlates with the volume fraction
minimum. Packings were cyclically compressed 1000 times. Response to
compression depends on pressure; low pressure packings have a constant volume
fraction regime, while high pressure packings continue to get dense with number
of cycles. The capability of stress-controlled, bulk-like particle simulations
to capture different protocols is showcased, and the ability to pack at low
pressures demonstrates unexpected behavior.

The use of ultrashort laser pulses to investigate the response of materials
on femtosecond time-scales enables detailed tracking of charge, spin and
lattice degrees of freedom. When pushing the limits of the experimental
resolution, connection to theoretical modeling becomes increasingly important
in order to infer causality relations. Weyl-semimetals is particular class of
materials of recent focus due to the topological protection of the Weyl-nodes,
resulting in a number of fundamentally interesting phenomena. In this work, we
provide a first-principles framework based on time-dependent density-functional
theory for tracking the distribution of Weyl-nodes in the Brillouin-zone
following an excitation by a laser pulse. For the material TaAs, we show that
residual shifts in the Weyl-Nodes' position and energy distribution is induced
by a photo-excitation within femto-seconds, even when the laser-frequency is
off-resonant with the Weyl-node. Further, we provide information about the
relaxation pathway of the photoexcited bands through lattice vibrations.

<h3>Propagation of light in cold emitter ensembles with quantum position  correlations due to static long-range dipolar interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16158</a>
<br>
<i>G. J. Bean, N. D. Drummond, J. Ruostekoski</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the scattering of light from dipolar emitters whose disordered
positions exhibit correlations induced by static, long-range dipole-dipole
interactions. The quantum-mechanical position correlations are calculated for
zero temperature bosonic atoms or molecules using variational and diffusion
quantum Monte Carlo methods. For stationary atoms in dense ensembles in the
limit of low light intensity, the simulations yield solutions for the optical
responses to all orders of position correlation functions that involve
electronic ground and excited states. We calculate how coherent and incoherent
scattering, collective linewidths, line shifts, and eigenmodes, and
disorder-induced excitation localization are influenced by the static
interactions and the density. We find that dominantly repulsive static
interactions in strongly confined oblate and prolate traps introduce
short-range ordering among the dipoles which curtails large fluctuations in the
light-mediated resonant dipole-dipole interactions. This typically results in
an increase in coherent reflection and optical depth, accompanied by reduced
incoherent scattering. The presence of static dipolar interactions permits the
highly selective excitation of subradiant eigenmodes in dense clouds. This
effect becomes even more pronounced in a prolate trap, where the resonances
narrow below the natural linewidth. When the static dipolar interactions affect
the optical transition frequencies, the ensemble exhibits inhomogeneous
broadening due to the nonuniformly experienced static dipolar interactions that
suppress cooperative effects.

<h3>Robust shaped pulses for arrays of superconducting or semiconductor spin  qubits with fixed Ising coupling</h3>

<br>
<br>
A major current challenge in solid-state quantum computing is to scale qubit
arrays to a larger number of qubits. This is hampered by the complexity of the
control wiring for the large number of independently tunable interqubit
couplings within these arrays. One approach to simplifying the problem is to
use a qubit array with fixed Ising ($ZZ$) interactions. When simultaneously
driving a specific subset of qubits in such a system, the dynamics are confined
to a set of commuting $\mathfrak{su}$(2) subalgebras. Within these
$\mathfrak{su}$(2)s we describe how to perform $X$-gates and $\frac{\pi}{2}$
$ZZ$ rotations robustly against either leakage, which is the main source of
error in transmon qubits, or coupling fluctuations, which is the main source of
infidelity in flux or semiconductor spin qubits. These gates together with
virtual-$z$ gates form a universal set of gates for quantum computing. We
construct this set of robust gates for two-edge, three-edge, and four-edge
vertices, which compose all existing superconducting qubit and semiconductor
spin qubit arrays.

<h3>Quantum theory of polariton weak lasing and polarization bifurcations</h3>

The quantum theory of polariton condensation in a trapped state reveals a
second-order phase transition evidenced by spontaneous polarization parity
breaking in sub-spaces of fixed polariton occupation numbers. The emission
spectra of polariton condensate demonstrate the coexistence of the
symmetry-conserving condensate state with the linear X polarization and the
symmetry-broken, elliptically polarized states in the vicinity of the
threshold. As a result, the oscillating linear second-order coherence
$g^{(2)}_{xx}(t)$, with $g^{(2)}_{xx}(t)<1$ over some time intervals, is
obtained. The spontaneous symmetry breaking is reflected in the second-order
cross correlator of circular polarizations. The related build-up of
elliptically-polarized weak lasing results also in non-monotonous dependence of
the circular second-order coherence on the excitation power and the interaction
strength.

<h3>Role of Multifidelity Data in Sequential Active Learning Materials  Discovery Campaigns: Case Study of Electronic Bandgap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16168" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16168</a>

Materials discovery and design typically proceeds through iterative
evaluation (both experimental and computational) to obtain data, generally
targeting improvement of one or more properties under one or more constraints
(e.g., time or budget). However, there can be great variation in the quality
and cost of different data, and when they are mixed together in what we here
call multifidelity data the optimal approaches to their utilization are not
established. It is therefore important to develop strategies to acquire and use
multifidelity data to realize the most efficient iterative materials
exploration. In this work, we assess the impact of using multifidelity data
through mock demonstration of designing solar cell materials, using the
electronic bandgap as the target property. We propose a new approach of using
multifidelity data through leveraging machine learning models of both low- and
high-fidelity data, where using predicted low-fidelity data as an input feature
in the high-fidelity model can improve the impact of a multifidelity data
approach. We show how tradeoffs of low- versus high-fidelity measurement cost
and acquisition can impact the materials discovery process, and find that the
use of multifidelity data has maximal impact on the materials discovery
campaign when approximately five low-fidelity measurements per high-fidelity
measurement are performed, and when the cost of low-fidelity measurements is
approximately 5% or less than that of high-fidelity measurements. This work
provides practical guidance and useful qualitative measures for improving
materials discovery campaigns that involve multifidelity data.

<h3>Temperature-induced reversal effects of kink dynamics in carbon nanotube  on flat substrate</h3>

Carbon nanotubes are nano-objects with quite anisotropic properties, for
example the mechanical properties in longitudinal and radial directions differ
significantly. This feature of the carbon nanotubes yields many interesting
phenomena investigated in last decades. One of them is the ability to form both
hollow and collapsed states if the radius of the nanotube is large enough. The
transitions between the two states have been also reported. In our study we
present single-walled carbon nanotube interacting with a plane substrate and
characterize the energy of interaction with the substrate using effective
Lennard-Jones-type potential. We show energy of the homogeneous open and
collapsed states depending on the radius of the carbon nanotube and report on
the bi-stability in some range of the nanotube diameters. Using the
molecular-dynamical simulations we look at the evolution of the initial
half-opened, half-collapsed state and demonstrate that the transition area from
one state to another is spatially localized having features of topological
soliton (kink or anti-kink). We show that the value and the direction of the
kink propagation speed depend significantly on the nanotube diameter as well as
on the temperature of the system. We also discuss the mechanism of the process
using a simplified model with asymmetric double-well potential and show the
entropic nature of the transition.

<h3>Revisiting spin ice physics in the ferromagnetic Ising pyrochlore  Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$</h3>

<br>
Pyrochlore materials are characterized by their hallmark network of
corner-sharing rare-earth tetrahedra, which can produce a wide array of complex
magnetic ground states. Ferromagnetic Ising pyrochlores often obey the
"two-in-two-out" spin ice rules, which can lead to a highly-degenerate spin
structure. Large moment systems, such as Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and
Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, tend to host a classical spin ice state with low-temperature
spin freezing and emergent magnetic monopoles. Systems with smaller effective
moments, such as Pr$^{3+}$-based pyrochlores, have been proposed as excellent
candidates for hosting a "quantum spin ice" characterized by entanglement and a
slew of exotic quasiparticle excitations. However, experimental evidence for a
quantum spin ice state has remained elusive. Here, we show that the
low-temperature magnetic properties of Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ satisfy several
important criteria for continued consideration as a quantum spin ice. We find
that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a partially spin-frozen ground state with a
large volume fraction of dynamic magnetism. Our comprehensive bulk
characterization and neutron scattering measurements enable us to map out the
magnetic field-temperature phase diagram, producing results consistent with
expectations for a ferromagnetic Ising pyrochlore. We identify key hallmarks of
spin ice physics, and show that the application of small magnetic fields
($\mu_0 H_c \sim$0.75T) suppresses the spin ice state and induces a long-range
ordered magnetic structure. Together, our work clarifies the current state of
Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and encourages future studies aimed at exploring the
potential for a quantum spin ice ground state in this system.

<h3>Electrothermal Actuation of NEMS Resonators: Modeling and Experimental  Validation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16196" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16196</a>

<br>

We study the electrothermal actuation of nanomechanical motion using a
combination of numerical simulations and analytical solutions. The
nanoelectrothermal actuator structure is a u-shaped gold nanoresistor that is
patterned on the anchor of a doubly-clamped nanomechanical beam or a
microcantilever resonator. This design has been used in recent experiments
successfully. In our finite-element analysis (FEA) based model, our input is an
ac current; we first calculate the temperature oscillations due to Joule
heating using Ohm's Law and the heat equation; we then determine the thermally
induced bending moment and the displacement profile of the beam by coupling the
temperature field to Euler-Bernoulli beam theory with tension. Our model
efficiently combines transient and frequency-domain analyses: we compute the
temperature field using a transient approach and then impose this temperature
field as a harmonic perturbation for determining the mechanical response in the
frequency domain. This unique modeling method offers lower computational
complexity and improved accuracy, and is faster than a fully transient FEA
approach. Our dynamical model computes the temperature and displacement fields
in time domain over a broad range of actuation frequencies and amplitudes. We
validate the numerical results by directly comparing them with experimentally
measured displacement amplitudes of NEMS beams around their eigenmodes in
vacuum. Our model predicts a thermal time constant of 1.9 ns in vacuum for our
particular structures, indicating that electrothermal actuation is efficient up
to ~80 MHz. We also investigate the thermal response of the actuator when
immersed in a variety of fluids.

<h3>Effects of the size and concentration of depleting agents on the  stabilization of the double-helix structure and DNA condensation: a single  molecule force spectroscopy study</h3>

We perform a single molecule force spectroscopy study to characterize the
role of the size (molecular weight) and concentration of depleting agents on
DNA condensation and on the stabilization of the double-helix structure,
showing that important features such as the threshold concentration for DNA
condensation, the force in which the melting plateau occurs and its average
length strongly depend on the depletant size chosen. Such results are
potentially important to understand how the presence of surrounding
macromolecules influences DNA stabilization inside living cells and therefore
advance in the understanding of the crowded cell environment on DNA-related
functions.

The inertial effects should be considered for micro- and nano-swimmers moving
in a low-density medium confined by irregular structures that create entropic
barriers, where viscous effects are no longer paramount. Here, we present a
separation mechanism of self-propelled particles in a two-dimensional
asymmetric channel, which leads to the drift of particles of different masses
in opposite directions. In particular, this mechanism is based on the combined
action of the spatial asymmetry of the channel structure, temporal asymmetry
inherent in particles dynamics, and an external static force. This work is
relevant for potential applications that can be found in the development of
lab-on-a-chip devices and artificial channels for separating particles of
different masses.

<h3>Electronic structures and transport properties of cove-edged graphene  nanoribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16208" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16208</a>
<br>
<i>David M T Kuo</i>
<br>
<br>
In this comprehensive study, we undertake a thorough theoretical examination
of the electronic subband structures within cove-edged zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (CZGNRs) using the tight-binding model. These unique nanostructures
arise from the systematic removal of carbon atoms along the zigzag edges of
conventional zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs). Notably, CZGNRs that exhibit
intriguing band gaps can be conceptualized as interconnected graphene quantum
dots (GQDs). An essential finding of our investigation is the inverse
relationship between the size of GQDs and the band gaps of CZGNRs, a
relationship that remains consistent regardless of the number of GQDs present.
Additionally, we delve into the examination of electron effective masses in
proximity to the edges of the first conduction subband of CZGNRs as GQD sizes
expand. We observe a significant increase in electron effective masses as GQDs
become larger, which is attributed to the increasing similarity between larger
GQDs and ZGNRs. To further understand the practical implications, we explore
the transport properties of finite CZGNRs when connected to electrodes through
line contacts. The presence of edge defects introduces intriguing asymmetries
in the tunneling current, leading to a significant reduction in its magnitude.
Notably, we observe that the saturation current magnitude is less influenced by
the length of CZGNRs and is instead more sensitive to the choice of materials
used for the contacted electrodes. Lastly, we investigate the tunneling
currents through GQDs featuring boron nitride textures within the Coulomb
blockade region, unveiling an irregular staircase-like pattern in the tunneling
current behavior.

<h3>Global Impact and Balancing Act: Deciphering the Effect of Fluorination  on B1s Binding Energies in Fluorinated $h$-BN Nanosheets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16229</a>

<br>
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) plays an important characterization
role in the pursuit of controllable fluorination of two-dimensional hexagonal
boron nitride ($h$-BN). However, there is a lack of clear spectral
interpretation and seemingly conflicting measurements exist. To discern the
structure-spectroscopy relation, we performed a comprehensive first-principles
study on the boron 1s edge XPS of fluorinated $h$-BN (F-BN) nanosheets. By
gradually introducing 1--6 fluorine atoms into different boron or nitrogen
sites, we created various F-BN structures with doping ratios ranging from 1-6%.
Our calculations reveal that fluorines landed at boron or nitrogen sites exert
competitive effects on the B1s binding energies (BEs), leading to red or blue
shifts in different measurements. Our calculations affirmed the hypothesis that
fluorination affects 1s BEs of all borons in the $\pi$-conjugated system,

that the BE generally increases with higher fluorine concentration when both
boron and nitrogen atoms are non-exclusively fluorinated. These findings
provide critical insights into how fluorination affects boron's 1s BEs,
contributing to a better understanding of fluorination functionalization
processes in $h$-BN and its potential applications in materials science.

In two-dimensional superconductors with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling, it
is known that an in-plane magnetic field can induce a helical superconducting
(SC) state with a phase modulation $e^{i {\bf q}\cdot {\bf r}}$. Here, we
theoretically investigate the stability of a stripe order, a weight-biased
superposition state composed of $+{\bf q}$ and $-{\bf q}$ modes taking the form
of $\Delta_+ e^{i{\bf q}\cdot{\bf r}}+\Delta_- e^{-i{\bf q}\cdot{\bf r}}$ with
$|\Delta_+|\neq|\Delta_-|\neq 0$, assuming that the spin-singlet pairing
channel is dominant. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we show that for both
s-wave and d-wave pairing symmetries, the stripe order can appear in the
high-field and low-temperature region inside the helical phase and that the
transition between the helical and stripe phases is of second order. It is
noteworthy that for the d-wave pairing, the stability region of the stripe
phase shrinks when the in-plane field is rotated from the nodal direction to
the anti-nodal direction. It is also found that the nonreciprocity of the
critical current, the so-called SC diode effect, emerges not only in the
helical phase but also in the stripe phase, with no clear nonreciprocity
anomaly at the helical-stripe transition due to its second-order nature.

Fujiyabu et al. have experimentally reported that mixing of 3-arm star
prepolymers into 4-arm analog improves the toughness of the resultant polymer
networks compared to the base network composed of 4-arm star polymers only. For
the mechanism of this phenomenon, this study conducted phantom chain
simulations for polymer networks composed of mixtures of star branch
prepolymers with equal arm length and different arm numbers, (f_1,f_2 )=(3,4),
(3,6) and (3,8), for various f_1=3 prepolymer fractions {\phi}_3. The networks
were created via end-linking reactions between prepolymers traced by a Brownian
dynamics scheme, and the network structure was stored at different conversion
ratios {\phi}_c, ranging from 0.6 and 0.9. The cycle rank of the gelated
networks {\xi} is fully consistent with the mean field theory, demonstrating
that the examined network structure is statistically fair. The networks were
stretched with energy minimization until the break, and fracture
characteristics including strain at break {\epsilon}_b, stress at break
{\sigma}_b, work for fracture W_b, and the ratio of broken strands {\phi}_bb,
were obtained. {\epsilon}_b, {\sigma}_b/{\phi}_bb, and W_b/{\phi}_bb data
plotted against {\xi} roughly follow the master curves reported for the base
networks without mixing, implying that the change of fracture properties by the
mixing of f_1=3 mainly corresponds to a decrease of {\xi}. The mixing slightly
suppresses {\sigma}_b/{\phi}_bb and W_b/{\phi}_bb for large f_2 cases compared
to the base networks because of a biased breakage at the network strands
without extenders, which are prepolymers with only two reacted arms. The
analysis for broken strands exhibited a new master curve for the
{\xi}-dependence of the molecular weight of broken strands.

Revealing the role of Coulomb interaction in topological semimetals with
Dirac/Weyl-like band dispersion shapes a new frontier in condensed matter
physics. Topological node-line semimetals (TNLSMs), anticipated as a fertile
ground for exploring electronic correlation effects due to the anisotropy
associated with their node-line structure, have recently attracted considerable
attention. In this study, we report an experimental observation for correlation
effects in TNLSMs realized by black phosphorus (BP) under hydrostatic pressure.
By performing a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and band
calculations on compressed BP, a magnetic-field-induced electronic instability
of Weyl-like fermions is identified under an external magnetic field parallel
to the so-called nodal ring in the reciprocal space. Anomalous spin
fluctuations serving as the fingerprint of electronic instability are observed
at low temperatures, and they are observed to maximize at approximately 1.0
GPa. This study presents compressed BP as a realistic material platform for
exploring the rich physics in strongly coupled Weyl-like fermions.

The lack of quantitative methods for studying chirality has stunted our
theoretical understanding of chirality-induced physical phenomena. The chiral
phonon has been proposed to be involved in various physical phenomena, but it
is not yet well defined mathematically. Here we examine two approaches for
assigning and quantifying the chirality of molecular normal modes in
double-helical molecular wires with various levels of twist. First, associating
with each normal mode a structure obtained by imposing the corresponding motion
on a common atomic origin, we apply the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to
quantitatively assess the relationship between the chirality-weighted normal
mode spectrum and the chirality of the underlying molecular structure. We find
that increasing the amount of twist in the double helix shifts the mean normal
mode CCM is to drastically higher values, implying that the chirality of
molecular normal modes is strongly correlated with that of the underlying
molecular structure. Second, we assign to each normal mode a pseudoscaler
defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all
atoms, and we analyze the handedness of the normal mode spectrum with respect
to this quantity. We find that twisting the double-chain structure introduces
asymmetry between right and left-handed normal modes so that in twisted
structures different frequency bands are charecterized by distinct handedness.
This can give rise to global phenomena such as thermal chirality.

Increasing the efficiency of charge transfer and separation efficiency of
photogenerated carriers are still the main challenges in the field of
semiconductor-based photocatalysts. Herein, we synthesized g-C3N4@V2C MXene
photocatalyst by modifying g-C3N4 using V2C MXene. The prepared photocatalyst
exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance under visible light. The
degradation efficiency of methyl orange by g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst was
as high as 94.5%, which is 1.56 times higher than that by g-C3N4. This was
attributed to the V2C MXene inhibiting the rapid recombination of
photogenerated carriers and facilitating rapid transfer of photogenerated
electrons (e) from g-C3N4 to MXene. Moreover, g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst
showed good cycling stability. The photocatalytic performance was higher than
85% after three cycles. Experiments to capture free radicals revealed that
superoxide radicals (02) are the main contributors to the photocatalytic
activity. Thus, the proposed g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst is a promising
visible-light catalyst.

Relaxation dynamics, as a key to understand glass formation and glassy
properties, remains an elusive and challenging issue in condensed matter
physics. In this work, in situ high-pressure synchrotron high-energy x-ray
photon correlation spectroscopy has been developed to probe the atomic-scale
relaxation dynamics of a cerium-based metallic glass during compression.
Although the sample density continuously increases, the collective atomic
motion initially slows down as generally expected and then counter-intuitively
accelerates with further compression (density increase), showing an unusual
non-monotonic pressure-induced steady relaxation dynamics crossover at ~3 GPa.
Furthermore, by combining in situ high-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction,
the relaxation dynamics anomaly is evidenced to closely correlate with the
dramatic changes in local atomic structures during compression, rather than
monotonically scaling with either sample density or overall stress level. These
findings could provide new insight into relaxation dynamics and their
relationship with local atomic structures of glasses.

La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin films on silicon substrates with
magneto-optical and optical properties comparable to high-quality epitaxial
layers grown on bulk SrTiO$_3$ (STO). The pulsed laser deposition growth of
LSMO is achieved by a two-dimensional nanosheet (NS) seed layer of
Ca$_2$Nb$_3$O$_{10}$ (CNO) inducing epitaxial stabilization of LSMO films. The
resulting layers possess a higher Curie temperature and a lower overall
magnetization than samples of LSMO on STO. Spectra of the full permittivity
tensor were calculated from optical and magneto-optical measurements. Spectral
dependencies of both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements share many
similarities between the LSMO/NS/Si and LSMO/STO samples. These similarities
indicate comparable electronic structures of the layers and demonstrate
comparable optical quality of textured LSMO on NS/Si and epitaxial LSMO on STO.

Anhydrous sodium hydroxide, a common and structurally simple compound, shows
spectacular isotope effects: NaOD undergoes a first-order transition, which is
absent in NaOH. By combining ab initio electronic structure calculations with
path integrals, we show that NaOH is an unusual example of a quantum
paraelectric: zero-point quantum fluctuations stretch the weak hydrogen bonds
(HBs) until they become unstable and break. By strengthening HBs via isotope
substitution or applied pressure, the system can be driven down to a
broken-symmetry antiferroelectric phase. We also provide a simple quantitative
criterion for HB breaking in layered crystals and show that nuclear quantum
effects are crucial in paraelectric to ferroelectric transitions in
hydrogen-bonded hydroxides.

Icosahedral nanoparticles composed of fivefold twinned tetrahedra have broad
applications. The strain relief mechanism and angular deficiency in icosahedral
multiply twinned particles are poorly understood in three dimensions. Here, we
resolved the three-dimensional atomic structures of Janus icosahedral
nanoparticles using atomic resolution electron tomography. A geometrically
fivefold face consistently corresponds to a less ordered face like two
hemispheres. We quantify rich structural variety of icosahedra including bond
orientation order, bond length, strain tensor; and packing efficiency, atom
number, solid angle of each tetrahedron. These structural characteristics
exhibit two-sided distribution. Edge dislocations near the axial atoms and
small disordered domains fill the angular deficiency. Our findings provide new
insights how the fivefold symmetry can be compensated and the
geometrically-necessary internal strains relived in multiply twinned particles.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a prospect of membranes that combine
negligible gas permeability with high proton conductivity and could outperform
the existing proton exchange membranes used in various applications including
fuel cells. Graphene oxide (GO), a well-known 2D material, facilitates rapid
proton transport along its basal plane but proton conductivity across it
remains unknown. It is also often presumed that individual GO monolayers
contain a large density of nanoscale pinholes that lead to considerable gas
leakage across the GO basal plane. Here we show that relatively large,
micrometer-scale areas of monolayer GO are impermeable to gases, including
helium, while exhibiting proton conductivity through the basal plane which is
nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of graphene. These findings
provide insights into the key properties of GO and demonstrate that chemical
functionalization of 2D crystals can be utilized to enhance their proton
transparency without compromising gas impermeability.

When a two-dimensional system undergoes a rapid quench from a disordered to
an ordered phase, it does not order instantly but instead relaxes towards
equilibrium over time. During this relaxation, the dynamical scaling hypothesis
predicts that the length scale of ordered regions increases, with later
patterns statistically similar to earlier ones except for a change in global
scale. Quantum gases are one of many systems in which such out of equilibrium
behaviour is predicted to occur. Here we present a method for systematically
testing when dynamical scaling is taking place, by quantifying the similarity
of the rescaled two-point correlation function over time using the Mahalanobis
distance. Data on the velocity field of a quantum fluid, generated from point
vortex simulations, are used to illustrate the application of this method.

We calculate the screened electron-electron interaction for the
charge-disproportionated insulator CaFeO$_3$ using the constrained random-phase
approximation (cRPA). While in many correlated materials, the formation of a
Mott-insulating state is driven by a large local Coulomb repulsion, represented
by the Hubbard $U$, several cases have been identified more recently where $U$
is strongly screened and instead the Hund's interaction $J$ dominates the
physics. Our results confirm a strong screening of the local Coulomb repulsion
$U$ in CaFeO$_3$ whereas $J$ is much less screened and can thus stabilize a
charge-disproportionated insulating state. This is consistent with the case of
the rare-earth nickelates where similar behavior has been demonstrated. In
addition, we validate some common assumptions used for parametrizing the local
electron-electron interaction in first-principles calculations based on
density-functional theory (DFT), assess the dependence of the interaction on
the choice of correlated orbitals, and discuss the use of the calculated
interaction parameters in DFT+$U$ calculations of CaFeO$_3$. Our work also
highlights some limitations of the cRPA approach for systems with strong
entanglement between the correlated and uncorrelated bands, which can lead to a
strong overscreening of the calculated interaction parameters.

A superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction with anomalous
phase shift (phi-0 S/F/S JJ) is a system, where the anomalous ground state
shift phi-0 provides a direct magnetoelectric coupling between a magnetic
moment and a phase of the superconducting condensate. If a chain of such phi-0
S/F/S JJs are coupled via superconducting leads, the condensate phase, being a
macroscopic quantity, mediates a long-range interaction between the magnetic
moments of the weak links. We study static and dynamic magnetic properties of
such a system. It is shown that it manifests properties of n-level system,
where the energies of the levels are only determined by projections of the
total magnetic moment onto the easy magnetic axis. It is similar to a magnetic
atom in a Zeeman field, but the role of the field is played by the
magnetoelectric coupling. However, unlike an atom in a magnetic field, the
relative order of energies of different states is controlled by electrical
means. It is also demonstrated that the projection of the total magnetic moment
can be fully controlled by a supercurrent and the response of the magnetic
system to local external perturbations is highly nonlocal.

Ab initio investigations of structural, electronic, and dynamical properties
of the high-temperature $\beta$ phase of copper pyrophosphate were performed
using density functional theory. The electronic band structure shows the Mott
insulating state due to electron correlations in copper ions. By calculating
phonon dispersion relations, the soft mode at the A point of the Brillouin zone
was revealed, showing the dynamical instability of the $\beta$ phase at low
temperatures. The double-well potential connected with the soft mode is derived
and the mechanism of the structural phase transition to the $\alpha$ phase is
discussed. The self-consistent phonon calculations based on the
temperature-dependent effective potential show the stabilization of the $\beta$
phase at high temperatures, due to the anharmonic effects. The pronounced
temperature dependence and the large line width of the soft mode indicate an
essential role of anharmonicity in the structural phase transition.

(BCTZ 50/50) thin film elaborated using pulsed laser deposition are studied
using permittivity and phase angle of the third harmonic measurements as
function of the AC measuring field $E_{\mathit{AC}}$ and temperature. The
global phase transition temperature $T_{\mathit{max}}$ for which the
permittivity is maximum, decreases from 330 K to 260 K when $E_{\mathit{AC}}$
increases. Rayleigh analysis of the AC field dependence of the relative
permittivity shows a regular decrease of the domain wall motion contributions
as temperature increases up to $T_{\mathit{max}}$ and an even more pronounced
decrease above $T_{\mathit{max}}$. This measurement reveals that the
ferroelectric behavior subsists 70 K above the global phase transition. The
phase angle of the third harmonic at temperatures below 275 K, is
characteristic of a conventional ferroelectric and from 275 K to
$T_{\mathit{max}}=$ 330 K of a relaxor. Above $T_{\mathit{max}}$, the thin film
exhibits a peculiar phase angle of the third harmonic, which consists of

A comprehensive understand of the intrinsic piezoelectric anisotropy stemming
from diverse chemical and physical factors is a key step for the rational
design of highly anisotropic materials. We performed high-throughput
calculations on tetragonal ABO3 perovskites to investigate the piezoelectricity
and the interplay between lattice, displacement, polarization and elasticity.
Among the 123 types of perovskites, the structural tetragonality is naturally
divided into two categories: normal tetragonal (c/a ratio < 1.1) and
super-tetragonal (c/a ratio > 1.17), exhibiting distinct ferroelectric,
elastic, and piezoelectric properties. Charge analysis revealed the mechanisms
underlying polarization saturation and piezoelectricity suppression in the
super-tetragonal region, which also produces an inherent contradiction between
high d33 and large piezoelectric anisotropy ratio |d33/d31|. The polarization
axis and elastic softness direction jointly determine the maximum longitudinal
piezoelectric response d33 direction. The validity and deficiencies of the
widely utilized |d33/d31| ratio for representing piezoelectric anisotropy were
reevaluated.

This article aims to study the linear and nonlinear optical response of
inversion symmetric graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in the presence of on-site
disorder or vacancies. The presence of disorder or vacancy breaks the special
inversion symmetry leading to the emergence of intense Hall-type anomalous
harmonics. This phenomenon is attributed to the intrinsic time-reversal
symmetry-breaking in quantum dots with a pseudo-relativistic Hamiltonian, even
in the absence of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that the effects
induced by disorder or vacancy have a distinct impact on the optical response
of GQDs. In the linear response, we observe significant Hall conductivity. In
the presence of an intense laser field, we observe the radiation of strong
anomalous odd and even-order harmonics already for relatively small levels of
disorder or mono-vacancy. The both disorder and vacancy lift the degeneracy of
states, thereby creating new channels for interband transitions and enhancing
the emission of near-cutoff high-harmonic signals.

We study the transition from cohesive to noncohesive granular states of
synthetic rocks under oedometric loading, combining simultaneous measurements
of ultrasound velocity and acoustic emissions. Our samples are agglomerates
made of glass beads bonded with a few percent of cement, either ductile or
brittle. These cemented granular samples exhibit an inelastic compaction beyond
certain axial stresses likely due to the formation of compaction bands, which
is accompanied by a significant decrease of compressional wave velocity. Upon
subsequent cyclic unloading and reloading with constant consolidation stress,
we found the mechanical and acoustic responses similar to those in noncohesive
granular materials, which can be interpreted within the effective medium theory
based on the Digby bonding model. Moreover, this model allows P-wave velocity
measured at vanishing pressure to be interpreted as an indicator of the
debonding on the scale of grain contact. During the inelastic compaction,
stick-slip like stress drops were observed in brittle cement-bonded granular
samples accompanied by the instantaneous decrease of the P-wave velocity and
acoustic emissions which display an Omori-like law for foreshocks, i.e.,
precursors. By contrast, mechanical responses of ductile cement-bonded granular
samples are smooth (without visible stick-slip like stress drops) and mostly
aseismic. By applying a cyclic loading and unloading with increasing
consolidation stress, we observed a Kaiser-like memory effect in the brittle
cement-bonded sample in the weakly damaged state which tends to disappear when
the bonds are mostly broken in the non-cohesive granular state after
large-amplitude loading. Our study shows that the macroscopic ductile and
brittle behavior of cemented granular media is controlled by the local
processes on the scale of the bonds between grains.

We undertake a theoretical analysis to probe the Kerr spectrum within the
superconducting phase of strontium ruthenate, where the Kerr rotation
experiments demonstrate the existence of a superconducting state with broken
time reversal symmetry. We find that spin-orbit coupling changes the
hybridization along the Fermi surface's diagonal zone mainly affects Hall
transport. We show that the dominant Hall response arises mainly from the
quasi-1D orbitals $d_{yz}$ and $d_{xz}$, linked to their hybridization, while
other contributions are negligible. This establishes that, the breaking of time
reversal symmetry of quasi-1D orbitals can account for the existence of the
Kerr angle, irrespective of the order symmetry specific to the $d_{xy}$
orbital. Moreover, the optical Hall conductivity and Kerr angle estimated for
the hypothesised superconducting orders also closely match the experimental
findings, providing important novel insight on the role of the spin-orbit
coupling, hybridization, and emergent order.

Measuring entropy production of a system directly from the experimental data
is highly desirable since it gives a quantifiable measure of the
time-irreversibility for non-equilibrium systems and can be used as a cost
function to optimize the performance of the system. Although numerous methods
are available to infer the entropy production of stationary systems, there are
only a limited number of methods that have been proposed for time-dependent
systems and, to the best of our knowledge, none of these methods have been
applied to experimental systems. Herein, we develop a general non-invasive
methodology to infer a lower bound on the mean total entropy production for
arbitrary time-dependent continuous-state Markov systems in terms of the

accurate estimates for the entropy production, both for theoretical toy models
and for experimental bit erasure, even with a very limited amount of

<h3>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on glasslike transitions  in the frustrated molecular conductors $θ$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2MM'$(SCN)$_4$</h3>

<i>Yohei Saito, Owen Ganter, Chao Shang, Kenichiro Hashimoto, Takahiko Sasaki, Stephen M. Winter, Jens Müller, Michael Lang</i>
<br>
<br>
We present results of the coefficient of thermal expansion for the frustrated
quasi-two-dimensional molecular conductor $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$RbZn(SCN)$_4$
for temperatures 1.5 K $\leq T \leq$ 290 K. A pronounced first-order phase
transition anomaly is observed at the combined charge-order/structural
transition at 215 K. Furthermore, clear evidence is found for two separate
glasslike transitions at $T_{\mathrm{g}}$ = 90-100 K and
$T_{\mathrm{g}}^\dagger$ = 120-130 K, similar to previous findings for
$\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$CsZn(SCN)$_4$ and $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$CsCo(SCN)$_4$,
reported in T. Thomas et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, L041114 (2022), both of which
lack the charge-order/structural transition. Our findings indicate that these
glasslike transitions are common features for the
$\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2MM^\prime$(SCN)$_4$ family with $M$ = (Rb, Cs) and
$M^\prime$ = (Co, Zn), irrespective of the presence or absence of charge order.
These results are consistent with our model calculations on the glasslike
dynamics associated with the flexible ethylene endgroups of the BEDT-TTF
molecules for various $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2MM^\prime$(SCN)$_4$ salts,
predicting two different conformational glass transitions. Moreover,
calculations of the hopping integrals show a substantial degree of dependence
on the endgroups' conformation, suggesting a significant coupling to the
electronic degrees of freedom. Our findings support the possibility that the
glassy freezing of the ethylene endgroups could drive or enhance glassy charge
dynamics.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we report on the first-ever studies of graphene exposed to
tritium gas in a controlled environment. The single layer graphene on
$\textrm{SiO}_2$/Si substrate was exposed to 400 mbar of $\textrm{T}_2$ for a
total time of ~55 h. The resistivity of the graphene sample was measured
in-situ during tritium exposure using the Van der Pauw method. After the
exposure, the samples were scanned with a confocal Raman microscope to study
the effect of tritium on the graphene structure as well as the homogeneity of
spectral modifications. We found that the sheet resistance increases by three
orders of magnitude during the exposure. By Raman microscopy, we demonstrate
that the graphene film can withstand the bombardment from the beta-decay of
tritium, and primary and secondary ions. Additionally, the Raman spectra after
tritium exposure are comparable with previously observed results in
hydrogen-loading experiments carried out by other groups. By thermal annealing
we could demonstrate, using Raman spectral analysis, that the structural
changes were partially reversible. Considering all observations, we conclude
that the graphene film was at least partially tritiated during the tritium
exposure.

<h3>The role of atomic interactions in cavity-induced continuous time  crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider continuous time-crystalline phases in dissipative many-body
systems of atoms in cavities, focusing on the role of short-range interatomic
interactions. First, we show that the latter can alter the nature of the time
crystal by changing the type of the underlying critical bifurcation. Second, we
characterize the heating mechanism and dynamics resulting from the short-range
interactions and demonstrate that they make the time crystal inherently
metastable. We argue that this is generic for the broader class of dissipative
time crystals in atom-cavity systems whenever the cavity loss rate is
comparable to the atomic recoil energy. We observe that such a scenario for
heating resembles the one proposed for preheating of the early universe, where
the oscillating coherent inflation field decays into a cascade of exponentially
growing fluctuations. By extending approaches for dissipative dynamical systems
to our many-body problem, we obtain analytical predictions for the parameters
describing the phase transition and the heating rate inside the
time-crystalline phase. We underpin and extend the analytical predictions of
the heating rates with numerical simulations.

In this paper, we explore the localization features of wave functions in a
family of mosaic quasiperiodic chains obtained by continuously interpolating
between two limits: the mosaic Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) model, known for its exact
mobility edges with extended states in the band-center region, and localized
ones in the band-edge regions for a large enough modulation amplitude, and the
mosaic Fibonacci chain, which exhibits its multifractal nature for all the
states except for the extended one with $E=0$ for an arbitrary finite
modulation amplitude. We discover that the mosaic AA limit for the states in
the band-edge regions evolves into multifractal ones through a cascade of
delocalization transitions. This cascade shows lobes of lower fractal dimension
values separated by maxima of fractal dimension. In contrast, the states in the
band-center region (except for the $E=0$ state) display an anomalous cascading
process, where it emerges lobes of higher fractal dimension values are
separated by the regions with lower fractal dimensions. Our findings offer
insight into understanding the multifractality of quasiperiodic chains.

The dynamic behavior of non-collinear atomic spin arrangements in a
topologically protected magnetic skyrmion plays a pivotal role in potential
future spintronic technologies, including racetrack memory based
ultra-high-density storage devices. However, the topological nature of the
skyrmion comes with an unwanted skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) that poses a
significant challenge in the practical application. Here we present a detailed
micromagnetic simulation study that delves into the controlled manipulation of
skyrmion dynamics through a subtle engineering of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) in a hybrid skyrmion racetrack. In particular, we introduce a
gradient variation of bulk and interfacial DMI that results into a parabolic
trajectory of Skyrmion Hall angle (SkHA), thereby allowing us to find a
critical DMI ratio with almost zero SkHE. Most importantly, we present a novel
approach involving engineering of a racetrack with strategically placed step
DMI regions that gives us a meticulous control over the size and speed of the
hybrid skyrmions. The present study gives a new direction for the simultaneous
realization of stable skyrmions without SkHE and increased skyrmion speed with
optimized DMI engineering.

Gauge theories are powerful tools in theoretical physics, allowing complex
phenomena to be reduced to simple principles, and are used in both high-energy
and condensed matter physics. In the latter context, gauge theories are
becoming increasingly popular for capturing the intricate spin correlations in
spin liquids, exotic states of matter in which the dynamics of quantum spins
never ceases, even at absolute zero temperature. We consider a spin system on a
three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice where emergent gauge fields not only
describe the spin liquid behaviour at zero temperature but crucially determine
the system's temperature evolution, with distinct gauge fields giving rise to
different spin liquid phases in separate temperature regimes. Focusing first on
classical spins, in an intermediate temperature regime, the system shows an
unusual coexistence of emergent vector and matrix gauge fields where the former
is known from classical spin ice systems while the latter has been associated
with fractonic quasiparticles, a peculiar type of excitation with restricted
mobility. Upon cooling, the system transitions into a low-temperature phase
where an entropic selection mechanism depopulates the degrees of freedom
associated with the matrix gauge field, rendering the system spin ice like. We
further provide numerical evidence that in the corresponding quantum model, a
spin liquid with coexisting vector and matrix gauge fields has a finite window
of stability in the parameter space of spin interactions down to zero
temperature. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings for non-Kramers
pyrochlore materials.

<br>
<br>
The heavy-fermion compound CeRhIn$_5$ can be tuned through a quantum critical
point, when In is partially replaced by Sn. This way additional charge carriers
are introduced and the antiferromagnetic order is gradually suppressed to zero
temperature. Here we investigate the temperature-dependent optical properties
of CeRh(In$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$)$_5$ single crystals for $x = 4.4\%$, $6.9\%$ and
$9.8\%$. With increasing Sn concentration the infrared conductivity reveals a
clear enhancement of the $c$-$f$ hybridization strength. At low temperatures we
observed a non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the frequency dependence of the
scattering rate and effective mass in all three compounds. In addition, below a
characteristic temperature $T^* \approx 10$ K, the temperature dependent
resistivity $\rho(T)$ follows a $\log T$ behavior, typical for a non-Fermi
liquid. The temperature-dependent magnetization also exhibits anomalous
behavior below $T^*$. Our investigation reveal that below $T^*$ the system
shows a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid behavior and $T^*$ monotonically increases
as the quantum critical point is approached.

<h3>Significance of Elastic Coupling for Stresses and Leakage in Frictional  Contacts</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study how the commonly neglected coupling of normal and in-plane elastic
response affects tribological properties when Hertzian or randomly rough
indenters slide past an elastic body. Compressibility-induced coupling is found
to substantially increase maximum tensile stresses, which cause materials to
fail, and to decrease friction such that Amontons law is violated
macroscopically even when it holds microscopically. Confinement-induced
coupling increases friction and enlarges domains of high tension. Moreover,
both types of coupling affect the gap topography and thereby leakage. Thus,
coupling can be much more than a minor perturbation of a mechanical contact.

<h3>Non-reciprocity permits edge states and strong localization in  stochastic topological systems</h3>

<i>Aleksandra Nelson, Evelyn Tang</i>
<br>
<br>
According to the celebrated bulk-boundary correspondence, topological
invariants in the bulk yield a system response on the boundary. While this has
been established in quantum and other classical systems, we demonstrate that
this correspondence operates under different conditions in stochastic systems.
Namely, despite sharing the same bulk topological invariant, stochastic systems
only exhibit boundary responses in the presence of non-reciprocal (or
non-Hermitian) transitions. Indeed, this response in stochastic systems grows
dramatically with increasing non-reciprocity but plateaus in quantum systems --
which we demonstrate for two models exhibiting localized probability and steady
state currents respectively. For the latter, we propose a novel mechanism by
which non-reciprocity engenders the steady-state edge current: it allows the
spectrum to spread in complex space thereby decreasing edge-bulk hybridization.
Our work highlights the necessity of non-reciprocal interactions in permitting
localized dynamics in soft and living matter.

<h3>Assessing the Suitability of the Langevin Equation for Analyzing  Measured Data Through Downsampling</h3>

The measured time series from complex systems are renowned for their
intricate stochastic behavior, characterized by random fluctuations stemming
from external influences and nonlinear interactions. These fluctuations take
diverse forms, ranging from continuous trajectories reminiscent of Brownian
motion to noncontinuous trajectories featuring jump events. The Langevin
equation serves as a powerful tool for generating stochasticity and capturing
the complex behavior of measured data with continuous stochastic
characteristics. However, the traditional modeling framework of the Langevin
equation falls short when it comes to capturing the presence of abrupt changes,
particularly jumps, in trajectories that exhibit non-continuity. Such
non-continuous changes pose a significant challenge for general processes and
have profound implications for risk management. Moreover, the discrete nature
of observed physical phenomena, measured with a finite sample rate, adds
another layer of complexity. In such cases, data points often appear as a
series of discontinuous jumps, even when the underlying trajectory is
continuous. In this study, we present an analytical framework that goes beyond
the limitations of the Langevin equation. Our approach effectively
distinguishes between diffusive or Brownian-type trajectories and trajectories
with jumps. By employing downsampling techniques, where we artificially lower
the sample rate, we derive a set of measures and criteria to analyze the data
and differentiate between diffusive and non-diffusive behaviors. To further
demonstrate its versatility and practical applicability, we have applied our
proposed method to real-world data in various scientific fields, turbulence,
optical tweezers for trapped particles, neuroscience, renewable energy, and
market price analysis.

<br>

We examine the thermodynamic characteristics of unified quantum statistics as
a novel framework that undergoes a crossover between Bose-Einstein and
Fermi-Dirac statistics by varying a generalization parameter $\delta$. We find
an attractive intrinsic statistical interaction when $\delta\le0.5$ where the
thermodynamic curvature remains positive throughout the entire physical range.
For $0.5 < \delta < 1$ the system exhibits predominantly Fermi-like behavior at
high temperatures, while at low temperatures, the thermodynamic curvature is
positive and the system behaves like bosons. As the temperature decreases
further, the system undergoes a transition into the condensate phase. We also
report on a critical fugacity ($z = Z^*$) defined as the point at which the
thermodynamic curvature changes sign, i.e. for $z< Z^*$ ($z > Z^*$), the
statistical behavior resembles that of fermions (bosons). Also, we extract the
variation of statistical behaviour of the system for different values of
generalization parameter with respect to the temperature. We evaluate the
critical fugacity and critical $\delta$ dependent condensation temperature of
the system. Finally, we investigate the specific heat as a function of
temperature and condensation phase transition temperature of the system for
different values of generalization parameter in different dimensions.

We consider fermions in phosphorene through double barriers and study the
corresponding Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shift. To accomplish this, we initially
compute the corresponding transmission amplitude by applying boundary
conditions. From the resulting transmission phase, we extract the GH shift. Our
findings reveal that the GH shift's magnitude is contingent upon the energy of
the incident electron and the barrier parameters. Additionally, we observe that
the GH shift changes sign at the transmission boundaries-specifically, at the
transmission resonances occurring immediately before and after the gap region,
where transmission is zero.

Many different types of phases can form within alloys, from highly-ordered
intermetallic compounds, to structurally-ordered but chemically-disordered
solid solutions, and structurally-disordered (i.e. amorphous) metallic glasses.
The different types of phases display very different properties, so predicting
phase formation is important for understanding how materials will behave. Here,
we review how first-principles data from the AFLOW repository and the aflow++
software can be used to predict phase formation in alloys, and describe some
general trends that can be deduced from the data, particularly with respect to
the importance of disorder and entropy in multicomponent systems.

<h3>Role of cilia activity and surrounding viscous fluid on properties of  metachronal waves</h3>

<br>
<br>
Large groups of active cilia collectively beat in a fluid medium as
metachronal waves, essential for some microorganisms motility and for flow
generation in mucociliary clearance. Several models can predict the emergence
of metachronal waves, but what controls the properties of metachronal waves is
still unclear. Here, we investigate numerically a simple model for cilia in the
presence of noise on regular lattices in one- and two-dimensions. We
characterize the wave using spatial correlation and the frequency of collective
beating. Our results clearly show that the viscosity of the fluid medium does
not affect the wavelength; the activity of the cilia does. These numerical
results are supported by a dimensional analysis, which is expected to be robust
against the model for active force generation, unless surrounding fluid
influences the cilia activity. Interestingly, enhancement of cilia activity
increases the wavelength and decreases the beating frequency, keeping the wave
velocity almost unchanged. These results might have significance in
understanding paramecium locomotion and mucociliary clearance diseases.

<br>
<br>
The widespread use of the noninteracting ground state as the initial state
for the digital quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model is largely due to
the scarcity of alternative easy-to-prepare approximations to the exact ground
state in the literature. Exploiting the fact that the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Heisenberg model is the effective low-energy theory of the Fermi-Hubbard model
at half-filling in the strongly interacting limit, here we propose a three-step
deterministic quantum routine to prepare an educated guess of the ground state
of the Fermi-Hubbard model through a shallow circuit suitable for near-term
quantum hardware. First, the ground state of the Heisenberg model is
initialized via a hybrid variational method using an ansatz that explores only
the correct symmetry subspace. Second, a general method is devised to convert a
multi-spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ wave function into its fermionic version. Third,
taking inspiration from the Baeriswyl ansatz, a constant-depth single-parameter
layer that adds doublon-holon pairs is applied to this fermionic state.
Numerical simulations on chains and ladders with up to 12 sites confirm the
improvement over the noninteracting ground state of the overlap with the exact
ground state for the intermediate values of the interaction strength at which
quantum simulation is bound to be most relevant.

Direct interactions between quantum particles naturally fall off with
distance. For future-proof qubit architectures, however, it is important to
avail of interaction mechanisms on different length scales. In this work, we
utilize a superconducting resonator to facilitate a coherent interaction
between two semiconductor spin qubits 250 $\mu$m apart. This separation is
several orders of magnitude larger than for the commonly employed direct
interaction mechanisms in this platform. We operate the system in a regime
where the resonator mediates a spin-spin coupling through virtual photons. We
report anti-phase oscillations of the populations of the two spins with
controllable frequency. The observations are consistent with iSWAP oscillations
and ten nanosecond entangling operations. These results hold promise for
scalable networks of spin qubit modules on a chip.

<h3>Effect of initial conditions on current fluctuations in non-interacting  active particles</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of initial conditions on the fluctuations of the
integrated density current across the origin up to time $t$ in a
one-dimensional system of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles. We consider
step initial conditions for both density and magnetization fields where all
particles are uniformly distributed to the left of the origin at $t=0$. Each
particle has initial probabilities $f^+$ and $f^-$ to move with an initial
velocity $+v$ and $-v$ respectively, where $v>0$. We derive exact results for
the variance of the current for annealed and quenched averages over the initial
conditions of the density and magnetization fields. Our analytical results
demonstrate that the variance displays a $\sqrt{t}$ behavior at large times,
with a prefactor contingent on the specific density initial conditions used.
However, at short times, the variance displays either linear $t$ or quadratic
$t^2$ behavior, which depends on the combination of density and magnetization
initial conditions, along with the fraction $f^+$ of particles in the positive
velocity state at $t=0$. Intriguingly, if $f^+=0$, the variance exhibits a
$t^2$ behavior at short times with the same prefactor irrespective of the
initial conditions for the density and magnetization fields.

We investigate the structural and dynamic properties of active Brownian

strength of the confinement and the P\'eclet number, we observe a novel
re-entrant behavior that is not present in unconfined systems. Our findings are
substantiated by numerical simulations and analytical considerations, revealing
that this behavior arises from the strong coupling between the P\'eclet number
and the effective confining dimensionality of the APs. Beyond highlighting the
important influence of soft boundaries on APs, our research holds significance

Layered cuprates offer a preferential playground for optical non-linearity
thanks to the emergence, below Tc, of soft out-of-plane Josephson plasmons. The
hallmark of such a non-linearity is the observation of Third Harmonic
Generation, that has been theoretically understood as a sum-frequency process
involving a two-plasmon excitation. However, recent experiments in cuprates
with two planes per unit cell challenge this interpretation, due to the lack of
resonant response at the temperature where the driving frequency matches the
plasma energy scale, as observed instead in single-layer cuprates. Here we show
that such an apparent discrepancy in bilayer systems can be resolved by taking
into account the combined effect of light polarization and Josephson-coupling
anisotropy on setting the energy range where three-dimensional layered plasma
modes can be resonantly excited. Our results offer a novel perspective on the
possibility to tune on demand high-harmonic generation by artificially
designing Josephson heterostructures.

Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state
(EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing
fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are
applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under
conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex
empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here,
we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including
supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation has only one
dimensionless parameter: the Gr\"uneisen parameter for the fluid. The GAP
equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most
fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the
pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the
molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal
energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental
data in several different ways and find good agreement. We observe that the GAP
equation is similar to the Mie-Gr\"{u}neisen solid EOS in a wide range of the
liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed
state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP
equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps
in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the
liquid EOS.

Amongst the various fascinating types of material behavior featured by
magnetic gels and elastomers are magnetostrictive effects. That is,
deformations in shape or changes in volume are induced from outside by external
magnetic fields. Application of the materials as soft actuators is therefore
conceivable. Mostly, straight contraction or extension of the materials along a
certain direction is discussed and investigated in this context. Here, we
demonstrate that various further, different, higher modes of deformation can be
excited. To this end, different spatial arrangements of the magnetizable
particles enclosed by the soft elastic matrix, which constitute the materials,
need to be controlled and realized. We address various different types of
spatial configurations of the particles and evaluate resulting types of
deformation using theoretical tools developed for this purpose. Examples are
sheet-like arrangements of particles, circular or star-shaped arrangements of
chain-like aggregates, or actual three-dimensional star-like particle
configurations. We hope to stimulate with our work the development of
experimental design and engineering methods so that selected spatial particle
arrangements in magnetic gels and elastomers can be put to reality. Overall, we
in this way wish to promote the transfer of these promising class of materials
to real-world applications.

We analyze the internal symmetries and their anomalies in the Kitaev spin-$S$
models. Importantly, these models have a lattice version of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
1-form symmetry, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$. There is also an ordinary
0-form $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$
symmetry, where $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}$ are $\pi$ spin
rotations around two orthogonal axes, and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ is the time reversal
symmetry. The anomalies associated with the full
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$
symmetry are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{17}$. We find that for
$S\in\mathbb{Z}$ the model is anomaly-free, while for
$S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$ there is an anomaly purely associated with the
1-form symmetry, but there is no anomaly purely associated with the ordinary
symmetry or mixed anomaly between the 0-form and 1-form symmetries. The
consequences of these anomalies apply to not only the Kitaev spin-$S$ models,
but also any of their perturbed versions, assuming that the perturbations are
local and respect the symmetries. If these local perturbations are weak, these
consequences apply even if the perturbations break the 1-form symmetry. A
notable consequence is that there must be a deconfined fermionic excitation
carrying no fractional quantum number under the
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry if
$S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$.
