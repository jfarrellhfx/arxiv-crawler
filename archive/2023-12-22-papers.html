<i>Frederik Møller, Federica Cataldini, Jörg Schmiedmayer</i>
<p>In the hydrodynamics of integrable models, diffusion is a subleading
correction to ballistic propagation. Here we quantify the diffusive
contribution for one-dimensional Bose gases and find it most influential in the
crossover between the main thermodynamic regimes of the gas. Analysing the
experimentally measured dynamics of a single density mode, we find diffusion to
be relevant only for high wavelength excitations. Instead, the observed
relaxation is solely caused by a ballistically driven dephasing process, whose
time scale is related to the phonon lifetime of the system and is thus useful
to evaluate the applicability of the phonon bases typically used in quantum
field simulators.

<h3>Stoichiometry Representation Learning with Polymorphic Crystal  Structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13289" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13289</a>
<br>
<i>Namkyeong Lee, Heewoong Noh, Gyoung S. Na, Tianfan Fu, Jimeng Sun, Chanyoung Park</i>
<p>Despite the recent success of machine learning (ML) in materials science, its
success heavily relies on the structural description of crystal, which is
itself computationally demanding and occasionally unattainable. Stoichiometry
descriptors can be an alternative approach, which reveals the ratio between
elements involved to form a certain compound without any structural
information. However, it is not trivial to learn the representations of
stoichiometry due to the nature of materials science called polymorphism, i.e.,
a single stoichiometry can exist in multiple structural forms due to the
flexibility of atomic arrangements, inducing uncertainties in representation.
To this end, we propose PolySRL, which learns the probabilistic representation
of stoichiometry by utilizing the readily available structural information,
whose uncertainty reveals the polymorphic structures of stoichiometry.
Extensive experiments on sixteen datasets demonstrate the superiority of
PolySRL, and analysis of uncertainties shed light on the applicability of
PolySRL in real-world material discovery. The source code for PolySRL is
available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/PolySRL_AI4Science.

<h3>All-Optical Domain Inversion in LiNbO3 Crystals by Visible  Continuous-Wave Laser Irradiation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13291" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13291</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos Sebastián-Vicente, Jörg Imbrock, Simon Laubrock, Olga Caballero-Calero, Angel García-Cabañes, Mercedes Carrascosa</i>
<p>LiNbO3 is a distinguished multifunctional material where ferroelectric domain
engineering is of paramount importance. This degree of freedom of the
spontaneous polarization remarkably enhances the applicability of LiNbO3, for
instance in nonlinear photonics. However, conventional electrical poling
suffers from several drawbacks. Namely, the lithographic patterning of
electrodes is cumbersome and expensive, and the spatial resolution is
constrained. In this work, we report the first method for all-optical domain
inversion of LiNbO3 crystals using continuous-wave visible light. While we
mainly focus on iron-doped LiNbO3, the applicability of the method is also
showcased in undoped congruent LiNbO3. The technique is outstandingly simple,
low-cost and readily accessible. It relies on ubiquitous elements: a light
source with low/moderate power, basic optics and a conductive surrounding
medium, e.g. water. Light-induced domain inversion is unequivocally
demonstrated and characterized by combination of several experimental
techniques: pyroelectric trapping of charged microparticles, selective chemical
etching, surface topography profilometry, scanning electron microscopy and 3D
Cerenkov microscopy. The influence of light intensity, exposure time, laser
spot size and surrounding medium is thoroughly studied. Overall, our
all-optical method offers straightforward implementation of LiNbO3
ferroelectric domain engineering, potentially sparking new research endeavors
aimed at novel optoelectronic applications of photovoltaic LiNbO3 platforms.

<h3>Charge-4$e$ Superconductivity in a Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13348</a>
<br>
<i>Martina O. Soldini, Mark H. Fischer, Titus Neupert</i>
<p>A phase of matter in which fermion quartets form a superconducting
condensate, rather than the paradigmatic Cooper pairs, is a recurrent subject
of experimental and theoretical studies. However, a comprehensive microscopic
understanding of charge-4$e$ superconductivity as a quantum phase is lacking.
Here, we propose and study a two-orbital tight-binding model with attractive
Hubbard-type interactions. Such a model naturally provides the Bose-Einstein
condensate as a limit for electron quartets and supports charge-4$e$
superconductivity, as we show by mapping it to a spin-1/2 chain in this
perturbative limit. Using both exact diagonalization and density matrix
renormalization group calculations for the one-dimensional case, we further
establish that the ground state is indeed a superfluid phase of 4$e$ charge
carriers and that this phase can be stabilized well beyond the perturbative
regime. Importantly, we demonstrate that 4$e$ condensation dominates over 2$e$
condensation even for nearly decoupled orbitals, a scenario suitable for
experiments with ultracold atoms in the form of almost decoupled chains. Our
model paves the way for both experimental and theoretical exploration of 4$e$
superconductivity and provides a natural starting point for future studies
beyond one dimension or more intricate 4$e$ states.

<h3>Entanglement smectic and stripe order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13362</a>
<br>
<i>Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot</i>
<p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and more recently entanglement are two
cornerstones of quantum matter. We introduce the notion of anisotropic
entanglement ordered phases, where the spatial profile of spin-pseudospin
entanglement spontaneously lowers the four-fold rotational symmetry of the
underlying crystal to a two-fold one, while the charge density retains the full
symmetry. The resulting phases, which we term $\textit{entanglement smectic}$
and $\textit{entanglement stripe}$, exhibit a rich Goldstone mode spectrum and
a set of phase transitions as a function of underlying anisotropies. We discuss
experimental consequences of such anisotropic entanglement phases
distinguishing them from more conventional charge or spin stripes. Our
discussion of this interplay between entanglement and spontaneous symmetry
breaking focuses on multicomponent quantum Hall systems realizing textured
Wigner crystals, as may occur in graphene or possibly also in moir\'e systems,
highlighting the rich landscape and properties of possible entanglement ordered
phases.

<h3>Strange-metal behavior without fine-tuning in PrV2Al20</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13366" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13366</a>
<br>
<i>Marvin Lenk, Fei Gao, Johann Kroha, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</i>
<p>Strange-metal behavior observed in the praseodymium-based heavy-fermion
material PrV2Al20 has been tentatively interpreted in the framework of
proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) associated with quadrupolar
ordering. Here, we demonstrate that an alternative, natural explanation exists
without invoking a QCP, in terms of the unconventional nature of the
quadrupolar Kondo effect taking place in non-Kramers ions. Using a combination
of ab initio density-functional theory calculations and analytical arguments,
we construct a periodic Anderson model with realistic parameters to describe
PrV2Al20. We solve the model using dynamical mean-field theory preserving the
model symmetries and demonstrate the non-Fermi liquid strange-metal behavior
stemming from the two-channel nature of the quadrupolar Kondo effect. Our
calculations provide an explanation for the puzzling temperature dependence in
the magnetic susceptibility, and provide a basis for analyzing future
photoemission experiments.

<h3>Topological Superconductivity in Twisted Flakes of Nodal Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13367" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13367</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin P. Lucht, J. H. Pixley, Pavel A. Volkov</i>
<p>Twisted bilayers of nodal superconductors have been recently demonstrated to
be a potential platform to realize two-dimensional topological
superconductivity. Here we study the topological properties of twisted
finite-thickness flakes of nodal superconductors under applied current,
focusing on the case of a $N$-layer flake with a single twisted top layer. At
low current bias and small twist angles, the average nodal topological gap is
reduced with flake thickness as $\sim\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$, but the Chern
number grows $\sim \mathcal{O}(N)$. As a result, we find the thermal Hall
coefficient to be independent of $N$ at temperatures larger than the nodal gap.
At larger twist angles, we demonstrate that the nodal gap in the density of
states of the top layer is only weakly suppressed, allowing its detection in
scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. These conclusions are demonstrated
numerically in an atomic-scale tight-binding model and analytically through the
model's continuum limit, finding excellent agreement between the two. Finally,
we show that increasing the bias current leads to a sequence of topological
transitions, where the Chern number increases like $\sim\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
beyond the additive effect of stacking $N$ layers. Our results show that
twisted superconductor flakes are "$2.5$-dimensional" materials, allowing to
realize new electronic properties due to synergy between two-dimensional layers
extended to a finite thickness in a third dimension.

<h3>Quantum Scars and Caustics in Majorana Billiards</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13368</a>
<br>
<i>R. Johanna Zijderveld, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, İnanç Adagideli</i>
<p>We demonstrate that the classical dynamics influence the localization
behaviour of Majorana wavefunctions in Majorana billiards. By using a
connection between Majorana wavefunctions and eigenfunctions of a normal state
Hamiltonian, we show that Majorana wavefunctions in both p-wave and s-wave
topological superconductors inherit the properties of the underlying normal
state eigenfunctions. As an example, we demonstrate that Majorana wavefunctions
in topological superconductors with chaotic shapes feature quantum scarring.
Furthermore, we show a way to manipulate a localized Majorana wavefunction by
altering the underlying classical dynamics using a local potential away from
the localization region. Finally, in the presence of chiral symmetry breaking,
we find that the Majorana wavefunction in convex-shaped Majorana billiards
exhibits caustics formation, reminiscent of a normal state system with magnetic
field.

<h3>Non-equilibrium criticality at the onset of time-crystalline order in  $O(N)$ models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13372</a>
<br>
<i>Romain Daviet, Carl Philipp Zelle, Achim Rosch, Sebastian Diehl</i>
<p>We explore the phase transitions at the onset of time-crystalline order in
$O(N)$ models driven out-of-equilibrium. The spontaneous breaking of time
translation symmetry and its Goldstone mode are captured by an effective
description with $O(N)\times SO(2)$ symmetry. Using the renormalization group
and the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion in a leading two-loop analysis, we identify a
new non-equilibrium universality class. Strikingly, it controls the
long-distance physics no matter how small the microscopic breaking of
equilibrium conditions is. The $O(N=2)\times SO(2)$ symmetry group is realized
for magnon condensation in pumped yttirum iron garnet (YIG) films and in
exciton-polariton systems with a polarization degree of freedom.

<h3>Integrable-to-Thermalizing Crossover in Non-Equilibrium Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13391" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13391</a>
<br>
<i>Andrey Grankin, Victor Galitski</i>
<p>Motivated by the experiment by M. Budden {\em et al.} [Nature Physics {\bf
17}, 611 (2021)], who observed signatures of long-lived photo-induced
superconductivity, we develop an accurate analytical/computational approach to
non-equilibrium superconductivity following a quench. We consider the
BCS-Holstein model, which includes both integrable local electron-electron
interactions and integrability-breaking electron-phonon coupling. We develop
Keldysh-Eliashberg theory on the Kadanoff-Baym contour, which enables us to
describe non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconductor. We consider a quench
in interactions, which results in a dynamic transition from the initial
superconducting state to a normal thermal state in the end of the evolution. It
is shown that the dynamics contain two stages: The early-time integrable
behavior, involving coherent oscillations of the superconducting order
parameter, crosses over to the late-time ergodic dynamics exhibiting a thermal
decay into an equilibrium state. In the former regime, our computational
approach both reproduces exact analytical results on the integrable dynamics of
the order parameter and generalizes those to the case of an initial thermal
state. The method also succeeds for the first time in describing both
integrable-to-thermalizing crossover and the late-time thermal decay, which is
shown to be consistent with the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory (with the
exponential decay time dependent on the density of quasiparticle excitations).
We observe the electron distribution function approaching the Fermi-Dirac
thermal distribution at final stages. The details of two-time non-equilibrium
dynamics depend on the density of quasiparticles in the initial state and the
integrability-breaking parameters, which under certain conditions may result in
a long-lived transient superconductivity consistent with experiment.

<h3>Superfluid stiffness within Eliashberg theory: the role of vertex  corrections</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13392</a>
<br>
<i>Zachary M. Raines, Shang-Shun Zhang, Andrey V. Chubukov</i>
<p>In this work we consider the superfluid stiffness of a generically
non-Galilean invariant interacting system and investigate under what conditions
the stiffness may nonetheless approach the Galilean-invariant value $n/m$.
Within Eliashberg theory we find that the renormalized stiffness is
approximately given by $n/m$ in the case when the $l=0$ and $l=1$ components of
the effective Fermi-surface projected interaction are approximately equal over
a range of frequencies. This holds, in particular, when the interaction is
peaked at zero momentum transfer. We examine this result through three
complementary lenses: the $\delta (\omega)$ term in the conductivity, the phase
dependence of the Luttinger-Ward free energy, and the coupling of the amplitude
and phase sectors in the Hubbard-Stratonovich collective mode action. From
these considerations we show that the value of the stiffness is determined by
the strength of renormalization of the current vertex and that the latter can
be interpreted as the shift of the self-consistent solution due to flow of the
condensate, or alternatively as coupling of the phase mode to $l=1$
fluctuations of the order parameter. We highlight that even though the
superfluid stiffness in some non-Galilean systems approaches the Galilean
value, this is not enforced by symmetry, and in general the stiffness may be
strongly suppressed from its BCS value. As a corollary we obtain the generic
form of the phase action within Eliashberg theory and charge and spin Ward
identities for a superconductor with frequency dependent gap function.

<h3>Entanglement Dynamics in Monitored Systems and the Role of Quantum Jumps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13419</a>
<br>
<i>Youenn Le Gal, Xhek Turkeshi, Marco Schirò</i>
<p>Monitored quantum many-body systems display a rich pattern of entanglement
dynamics, which is unique to this non-unitary setting. This work studies the
effect of quantum jumps on the entanglement dynamics beyond the no-click limit
corresponding to a deterministic non-Hermitian evolution. We consider two
examples, a monitored SSH model and a quantum Ising chain, for which we show
the jumps have remarkably different effects on the entanglement despite having
the same statistics as encoded in their waiting-time distribution. To
understand this difference, we introduce a new metric, the statistics of
entanglement gain and loss due to jumps and non-Hermitian evolution. This
insight allows us to build a simple stochastic model of a random walk with
partial resetting, which reproduces the entanglement dynamics, and to dissect
the mutual role of jumps and non-Hermitian evolution on the entanglement
scaling. We demonstrate that significant deviations from the no-click limit
arise whenever quantum jumps strongly renormalize the non-Hermitian dynamics,
as in the case of the SSH model at weak monitoring or in the Ising chain at
large transverse field. On the other hand, we show that the weak monitoring
phase of the Ising chain leads to a robust sub-volume logarithmic phase due to
weakly renormalized non-Hermitian dynamics.

<h3>Ultraslow Growth of Number Entropy in an l-bit Model of Many-Body  Localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13420" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13420</a>
<br>
<i>David Aceituno Chávez, Claudia Artiaco, Thomas Klein Kvorning, Loïc Herviou, Jens H. Bardarson</i>
<p>We demonstrate that slow growth of the number entropy following a quench from
a local product state is consistent with many-body localization. To do this we
construct a random circuit l-bit model with exponentially localized l-bits and
exponentially decaying interactions between them. We observe an ultraslow
growth of the number entropy starting from a N\'eel state, saturating at a
value that grows with system size. This suggests that the observation of such
growth in microscopic models is not sufficient to rule out many-body
localization.

<h3>An active particle in one dimension subjected to resetting with memory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13439</a>
<br>
<i>Denis Boyer, Satya N. Majumdar</i>
<p>The study of diffusion with preferential returns to places visited in the
past has attracted an increased attention in recent years. In these highly
non-Markov processes, a standard diffusive particle intermittently resets at a
given rate to previously visited positions. At each reset, a position to be
revisited is randomly chosen with a probability proportional to the accumulated
amount of time spent by the particle at that position. These preferential
revisits typically generate a very slow diffusion, logarithmic in time, but
still with a Gaussian position distribution at late times. Here we consider an
active version of this model, where between resets the particle is
self-propelled with constant speed and switches direction in one dimension
according to a telegraphic noise. Hence there are two sources of
non-Markovianity in the problem. We exactly derive the position distribution in
Fourier space, as well as the variance of the position at all times. The
crossover from the short-time ballistic regime, dominated by activity, to the
large-time anomalous logarithmic growth induced by memory is studied. We also
analytically derive a large deviation principle for the position, which
exhibits a logarithmic time-scaling instead of the usual algebraic form.
Interestingly, at large distances, the large deviations become independent of
time and match the non-equilibrium steady state of a particle under resetting
to its starting position only.

<h3>Heisenberg spin chain with random-sign couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13452" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13452</a>
<br>
<i>Michele Fava, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Adam Nahum</i>
<p>We study the 1D quantum Heisenberg chain with randomly ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic couplings (a model previously studied by approximate
strong-disorder renormalization group). We find that, at least for sufficiently
large spin $S$, the ground state has "spin glass" order. The spin waves on top
of this state have the dynamical exponent ${z=3/2}$, intermediate between the
values $z=1$ of the antiferromagnet and ${z=2}$ of the ferromagnet. DMRG
simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results for spins ${S=1}$
and ${S=3/2}$. The case ${S=1/2}$ shows large finite size effects: we suggest
that this case is also ordered, but with a small ordered moment.

<h3>Critical slowing down in thermal soft-sphere glasses via energy  minimization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13466" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13466</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin A. Interiano-Alberto, Peter K. Morse, Robert S. Hoy</i>
<p>Using hybrid molecular dynamics/SWAP Monte Carlo (MD/SMC) simulations, we
show that the terminal relaxation times $\tau$ for FIRE energy minimization of
soft-sphere glasses exhibit thermal onset as samples become increasingly
well-equilibrated. We show that although $\tau(\phi)$ can decrease by orders of
magnitude as equilibration proceeds and the jamming density $\phi_{\rm J}$
increases via thermal onset, it always scales as $\tau(\phi) \sim (\phi_{\rm J}
- \phi)^{-2} \sim [Z_{\rm iso} - Z_{\rm ms}(\tau)]^{-2}$, where $\phi_{\rm J}$
is the jamming density and $Z_{\rm ms}(\tau)$ is the average coordination
number of particles satisfying a minimal local mechanical stability criterion
($Z \geq d+1$) \textit{at the top of} the final PEL sub-basin the system
encounters. This scaling allows us to (nearly) collapse $\tau$ datasets that
look very different when plotted as a function of $\phi$, and to address
another closely related question: how should the vibrational spectra of thermal
soft-sphere glasses evolve as they age at constant density?

<h3>Mechanical cosmology: simulating inflationary models in synthetic  mechanical lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13467</a>
<br>
<i>Brendan Rhyno, Ivan Velkovsky, Peter Adshead, Bryce Gadway, Smitha Vishveshwara</i>
<p>Inspired by recent advances in observational astrophysics and continued
explorations in the field of analog gravity, we discuss the prospect of
simulating models of cosmology within the context of synthetic mechanical
lattice experiments. We focus on the physics of expanding Universe scenarios
described by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric.
Specifically, quantizing scalar fluctuations in a background FLRW spacetime
leads to a quadratic bosonic Hamiltonian with temporally varying pair
production terms. Here we present a mapping that provides a one-to-one
correspondence between these classes of cosmology models and physical
mechanical oscillator systems. As proof-of-principle, we then perform
experiments on an actual synthetic lattice system composed of such oscillators.
We simulate two different FLRW expansion scenarios driven by inflationary dark
energy- and matter-dominated Universes and discuss our experimental results.

<h3>Development of Self-Shunted Josephson Junctions For a  Ten-Superconductor-Layer Fabrication Process: Nb/NbN$_x$/Nb Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13475</a>
<br>
<i>Sergey K. Tolpygo, Ravi Rastogi, Terence Weir, Evan B. Golden, Vladimir Bolkhovsky</i>
<p>To increase integration scale of superconductor electronics, we are
developing a new, SFQ7ee, node of the fabrication process at MIT Lincoln
Laboratory. In comparison to the existing SFQ5ee node, we increased the number
of fully planarized superconducting layers to ten and utilized NbN and NbN/Nb
kinetic inductors to increase the inductor number density above 100 million per
cm$^2$. Increasing the Josephson junction (JJ) number density to the same level
requires implementing self-shunted high-$J_c$ JJs. We investigated properties
of Nb/NbN$_x$/Nb trilayer JJs as a potential replacement of high-$J_c$
Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb JJs, where NbN$_x$ is a disordered, nonsuperconducting nitride
deposited by reactive sputtering. Dependences of the $I_cR_n$ product and
Josephson critical current density, $J_c$ on the NbN$_x$ barrier thickness and
on temperature were studied in the thickness range from 5 nm to 20 nm. The
fabricated JJs can be described by the microscopic theory of SNS junctions,
assuming no suppression of the energy gap in Nb electrodes near the NbN$_x$
interfaces and a Cooper pair decay length in the NbN$_x$ barrier of about 2.3
nm. Current-voltage characteristics of the JJs are well described by the RCSJ
model. In the studied range $J_c$ < 10 mA/$\mu$$m^2$, the Nb/NbN$_x$/Nb JJs
have lower specific resistance $R_nA$, lower $I_cR_n$ product, and a stronger
dependence of the $I_cR_n$ on temperature than self-shunted or critically
damped externally shunted Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb JJs with the same critical current
density; here $A$ is the JJ area, $R_n$ the JJ effective shunting resistance.

<i>Adbhut Gupta, C. Wang, S.K. Singh, K.W. Baldwin, R. Winkler, M. Shayegan, L.N. Pfeiffer</i>
<p>Owing to their large effective mass, strong and tunable spin-orbit coupling,
and complex band-structure, two-dimensional hole systems (2DHSs) in GaAs
quantum wells provide rich platforms to probe exotic many-body physics, while
also offering potential applications in ballistic and spintronics devices, and
fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. We present here a systematic
study of molecular-beam-epitaxy grown, modulation-doped, GaAs (001) 2DHSs where
we explore the limits of low-temperature 2DHS mobility by optimizing two
parameters, the GaAs quantum well width and the alloy fraction ($x$) of the
flanking Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As barriers. We obtain a breakthrough in 2DHS
mobility, with a peak value $\simeq 18 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs at a density of
3.8 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ /cm$^{2}$, implying a mean-free-path of $\simeq 57
\mu$m. Using transport calculations tailored to our structures, we analyze the
operating scattering mechanisms to explain the non-monotonic evolution of
mobility with density. We find it imperative to include the dependence of
effective mass on 2DHS density, well width, and $x$. We observe concomitant
improvement in quality as evinced by the appearance of delicate fractional
quantum Hall states at very low density.

<h3>An occupation number quantum subspace expansion approach to compute the  single-particle Green function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13497" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13497</a>
<br>
<i>B. Gauthier, P. Rosenberg, A. Foley, M. Charlebois</i>
<p>We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to compute the Green
function for strongly correlated electrons on noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices. The technique consists in the construction of a non-orthogonal
excitation basis composed of a set of single-particle excitations generated by
occupation number operators. The excited sectors of the Hamiltonian in this
basis can then be measured on the quantum device and a classical
post-processing procedure yields the Green function in the Lehmann
representation. The technique allow for noise filtering, a useful feature for
NISQ devices. To validate the approach, we carry out a set of
proof-of-principle calculations on the single-band Hubbard model on IBM quantum
hardware. For a 2 site system we find good agreement between the results of
quantum simulations and the exact result for the local spectral function. A
simulation of a 4 site system carried out on classical hardware suggests that
the approach can achieve similar accuracy for larger systems.

<p>We systematically investigate the finite size scaling behavior of the R\'enyi
entanglement entropy (EE) of several representative 2d quantum many-body
systems between a subregion and its complement, with smooth boundaries as well
as boundaries with corners. In order to reveal the subleading correction, we
investigate the quantity ``subtracted EE" $S^s(l) = S(2l) - 2S(l)$ for each
model, which is designed to cancel out the leading perimeter law. We find that
$\mathbf{(1)}$ for a spin-1/2 model on a 2d square lattice whose ground state
is the Neel order, the coefficient of the logarithmic correction to the
perimeter law is consistent with the prediction based on the Goldstone modes;
$\mathbf{(2)}$ for the $(2+1)d$ O(3) Wilson-Fisher quantum critical point
(QCP), realized with the bilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, a
logarithmic subleading correction exists when there is sharp corner of the
subregion, but for subregion with a smooth boundary our data suggests the
absence of the logarithmic correction to the best of our efforts;
$\mathbf{(3)}$ for the $(2+1)d$ SU(2) J-Q$_2$ and J-Q$_3$ model for the
deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), we find a logarithmic correction for
the EE even with smooth boundary.

<p>Separating out the contributions of different scattering channels in strongly
interacting metals is crucial in identifying the mechanisms that govern their
properties. While momentum or current relaxation rates can be readily probed
via \textit{dc} resistivity or optical/THz spectroscopy, distinguishing
different kinds of inelastic scattering can be more challenging. Using
nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopy, we measure the rates of energy
relaxation after THz excitation in the strongly interacting Fermi liquid,
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Energy relaxation is a bound on the total scattering and
specifically a measure of contributions to the electron self-energy that arise
from {\it inelastic} coupling to a bath. We observe two distinct energy
relaxation channels: a fast process that we interpret as energy loss to the
phonon system and a much slower relaxation that we interpret as arising from a
non-equilibrium phonon effects and subsequent heat loss through diffusion.
Interestingly, even the faster energy relaxation rate is at least an order of
magnitude slower than the overall momentum relaxation rate, consistent with
strong electron interactions and the dominance of energy-conserving umklapp or
interband electron-electron scattering in momentum relaxation. The slowest
energy relaxation rate decays on a sub-GHz scale, consistent with the
relaxation dynamics of non-equilibrium phonons. Our observations reveal the
versatility of nonlinear THz spectroscopy to measure the energy relaxation
dynamics in correlated metals. Our work also highlights the need for improved
theoretical understanding of such processes in interacting metals.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions for Spintronics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13507</a>

<i>Ding-Fu Shao, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal</i>
<p>Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics has emerged as a subfield of spintronics,
where an AFM N\'eel vector is used as a state variable. Efficient electric
control and detection of the N\'eel vector are critical for spintronic
applications. This review article features fundamental properties of AFM tunnel
junctions (AFMTJs) as spintronic devices where such electric control and
detection can be realized. We emphasize critical requirements for observing a
large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in AFMTJs with collinear and
noncollinear AFM electrodes, such as a momentum-dependent spin polarization and
N\'eel spin currents. We further discuss spin torques in AFMTJs that are
capable of N\'eel vector switching. Overall, AFMTJs have potential to become a
new standard for spintronics providing larger magnetoresistive effects, few
orders of magnitude faster switching speed, and much higher packing density
than conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).

<h3>Revisit the phase diagram and piezoelectricity of lead zirconate  titanate from first principles</h3>

<br>
<i>Yubai Shi, Ri He, Bingwen Zhang, Zhicheng Zhong</i>
<p>Lead zirconate titanate (PbZr1-xTixO3, PZT) exhibits excellent piezoelectric
properties in the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region of its
temperature-composition phase diagram. However, the microscopic origin of its
high piezoelectric response remains controversial. Here, we develop a
machine-learning-based deep potential (DP) model of PZT using the training
dataset from first principles density functional theory calculations. Based on
DP-assisted large-scale atomic simulations, we reproduce the
temperature-composition phase diagram of PZT, in good agreement with the
experiment except the absence of structural transition from R3c to R3m. We find
that the rhombohedral phase maintains R3c symmetry with slight oxygen
octahedral tilting as increase of temperature, instead of appearing R3m
symmetry. This discrepancy can trace back to the lack of experimental
measurements to identify such slight octahedral tilting. More importantly, we
clarify the atomic-level feature of PZT at the MPB, exhibiting the competing
coupling of ferroelectric nanodomains with various polarization orientations.
The high piezoelectric response is driven by polarization rotation of
nanodomains induced by an external electric field.

<h3>Quantum electrodynamics under a quench</h3>

<br>
<i>Ming-Rui Li, Shao-Kai Jian</i>
<p>Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a cornerstone of particle physics and also
finds diverse applications in condensed matter systems. Despite its
significance, the dynamics of quantum electrodynamics under a quantum quench
remains inadequately explored. In this paper, we investigate the nonequilibrium
regime of quantum electrodynamics following a global quantum quench.
Specifically, a massive Dirac fermion is quenched to a gapless state with an
interaction with gauge bosons. In stark contrast to equilibrium
(3+1)-dimensional QED with gapless Dirac fermions, where the coupling is
marginally irrelevant, we identify a nonequilibrium fixed point characterized
by nonFermi liquid behavior. Notably, the anomalous dimension at this fixed
point varies with the initial quench parameter, suggesting an interesting
quantum memory effect in a strongly interacting system. Additionally, we
propose distinctive experimental signatures for nonequilibrium quantum
electrodynamics.

<i>Koichiro Yaji, Shunsuke Tsuda</i>
<p>Harnessing electron spin is crucial in developing energy-saving and
high-speed devices for the next generation. In this scheme, visualizing
spin-polarized electronic states aids in designing and developing new materials
and devices. Spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides information on
the spin-polarized electronic states. To investigate the spin-polarized
electronic states in microscopic materials and devices, spin-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy requires spatial resolution in a sub-micrometer
scale. Here we show the imaging-type spin-resolved photoemission microscopy
(iSPEM) with an ultraviolet laser developed at the National Institutes for
Materials Science (NIMS). Our iSPEM achieves a spatial resolution of 420 nm,
drastically improving by more than an order of magnitude compared to
conventional spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy instruments. Besides, the
multi-channel spin detector significantly reduces the data acquisition time by
four orders of magnitude compared to the conventional instruments. The iSPEM
machine elucidates the spin-polarized electronic states of sub-micrometer scale
materials, polycrystals, device structure samples, and so on, which have yet to
be the target of conventional spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

<p>The discrete and charge-separated nature of matter - electrons and nuclei -
results in local electrostatic fields that are ubiquitous in nanoscale
structures and are determined by their shape, material, and environment. Such
fields are relevant in catalysis, nanoelectronics and quantum nanoscience, and
their control will become even more important as the devices in question reach
few-nanometres dimensions. Surface-averaging techniques provide only limited
experimental access to these potentials at and around individual
nanostructures. Here, we use scanning quantum dot microscopy to investigate how
electric potentials evolve as nanostructures are built up atom by atom. We
image the potential over adatoms, chains, and clusters of Ag and Au atoms on
Ag(111) and quantify their surface dipole moments. By focusing on the total
charge density, these data establish a new benchmark for ab initio
calculations. Indeed, our density functional theory calculations not only show
an impressive agreement with experiment, but also allow a deeper analysis of
the mechanisms behind the dipole formation, their dependence on fundamental
atomic properties and on the atomic configuration of the nanostructures. This
allows us to formulate an intuitive picture of the basic mechanisms behind
dipole formation, which enables better design choices for future nanoscale
systems such as single atom catalysts.

<h3>Orbital-resolved DFT+U for molecules and solids</h3>

<br>
<i>Eric Macke, Iurii Timrov, Nicola Marzari, Lucio Colombi Ciacchi</i>
<p>We present an orbital-resolved extension of the Hubbard $U$ correction to
density-functional theory (DFT). Compared to the conventional shell-averaged
approach, the prediction of energetic, electronic and structural properties is
strongly improved, particularly for compounds characterized by both localized
and hybridized states in the Hubbard manifold. The numerical values of all
Hubbard parameters are readily obtained from linear-response calculations. The
relevance of this more refined approach is showcased by its application to bulk
solids pyrite (FeS$_2$) and pyrolusite ($\beta$-MnO$_2$), as well as to six
Fe(II) molecular complexes. Our findings indicate that a careful definition of
Hubbard manifolds is indispensable for extending the applicability of DFT+$U$
beyond its current boundaries. The present orbital-resolved scheme aims to
provide a computationally undemanding yet accurate tool for electronic
structure calculations of charge-transfer insulators, transition-metal (TM)
complexes and other compounds displaying significant orbital hybridization.

<p>The anomalous Floquet Anderson insulator (AFAI) has been theoretically
predicted in step-wise periodically driven models, but its stability under more
general driving protocols hasn't been determined. We show that adding disorder
to the anomalous Floquet topological insulator realized with a continuous
driving protocol in the experiment by K. Wintersperger et. al., Nat. Phys.
$\textbf{16}$, 1058 (2020), supports an AFAI phase, where, for a range of
disorder strengths, all the time averaged bulk states become localized, while
the pumped charge in a Laughlin pump setup remains quantized.

<h3>Entanglement of edge modes in (very) strongly correlated topological  insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13598" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13598</a>
<br>
<i>Nisa Ara, Emil Mathew, Rudranil Basu, Indrakshi Raychowdhury</i>
<p>Identifying topological phases for a strongly correlated theory remains a
non-trivial task, as defining order parameters, such as Berry phases, is not
straightforward. Quantum information theory is capable of identifying
topological phases for a theory that exhibits quantum phase transition with a
suitable definition of order parameters that are related to different
entanglement measures for the system. In this work, we study entanglement
entropy for a bi-layer SSH model, both in the presence and absence of Hubbard
interaction and at varying interaction strengths. For the free theory, edge
entanglement acts as an order parameter, which is supported by analytic
calculations and numerical (DMRG) studies. We calculate the symmetry-resolved
entanglement and demonstrate the equipartition of entanglement for this model
which itself acts as an order parameter when calculated for the edge modes. As
the DMRG calculation allows one to go beyond the free theory, we study the
entanglement structure of the edge modes in the presence of on-site Hubbard
interaction for the same model. A sudden reduction of edge entanglement is
obtained as interaction is switched on. The explanation for this lies in the
change in the size of the degenerate subspaces in the presence and absence of
interaction. We also study the signature of entanglement when the interaction
strength becomes extremely strong and demonstrate that the edge entanglement
remains protected. In this limit, the energy eigenstates essentially become a
tensor product state, implying zero entanglement. However, a remnant entropy
survives in the non-trivial topological phase which is exactly due to the
entanglement of the edge modes.

<h3>Rectification of heat current in Corbino geometry</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhixing Zou, Giulio Casati, Giuliano Benenti, Jiao Wang</i>
<p>We prove analytically the ballistic thermal rectification effect (BTRE) in
the Corbino disk characterized by an annular shape. We derive the thermal
rectification efficiency (RE) and show that it can be expressed as the product
of two independent functions, the first dependent on the temperatures of the
heat baths and the second on the system's geometry. It follows that a perfect
BTRE can be reached with the increase of the ratios of the heat baths'
temperatures and of the radius of the outer edge to the inner edge of the disk.
We also show that, by introducing a potential barrier into the Corbino disk,
the RE can be greatly improved. Quite remarkably, by an appropriate choice of
parameters, the thermal diode effect can be reversed. Our results are robust
under variation of the Corbino geometry, which may provide a novel and flexible
route to manipulate the heat flow at the nanoscale.

<p>The recent discovery of superconductivity and magnetism in trilayer
rhombohedral graphene (RG) establishes an ideal, untwisted platform to study
strong correlation electronic phenomena. However, the correlated effects in
multilayer RG have received limited attention, and, particularly, the evolution
of the correlations with increasing layer number remains an unresolved
question. Here, we show the observation of layer-dependent electronic
structures and correlations in RG multilayers from 3 to 9 layers by using
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We explicitly determine
layer-enhanced low-energy flat bands and interlayer coupling strength. The
former directly demonstrates the further flattening of low-energy bands in
thicker RG, and the later indicates the presence of varying interlayer
interactions in RG multilayers. Moreover, we find significant splitting of the
flat bands, ranging from ~50-80 meV, under liquid nitrogen temperature when
they are partially filled, indicating the emergence of interaction-induced
strongly correlated states. Particularly, the strength of the correlated states
is notably enhanced in thicker RG and reaches its maximum in the six-layer,
validating directly theoretical predictions and establishing abundant new
candidates for strongly correlated systems. Our results provide valuable
insights into the layer dependence of the electronic properties in RG, paving
the way for investigating robust and highly accessible correlated phases in
simpler systems.

<br>
<i>K. K. Pandey, H. K. Poswal</i>
<p>In situ studies under severe plastic deformation at high pressures, employing
rotational/shear diamond anvil cells (RDAC), have recently gained much interest
in the high-pressure community owing to their potential applications in
material processing methods, mechanochemistry, geophysics, etc. These studies,
combined with multi-scale computational simulations, provide important insights
into the transient hierarchical microstructural evolution, structural phase
transitions, and orientation relationship between parent and daughter phases
and help establish the kinetics of strain-induced phase transitions under
severe plastic deformation. Existing RDACs are mostly used in axial x-ray
diffraction geometry due to geometrical constraints providing less reliable
information about stress states and texture. Their asymmetric design also poses
serious limitations to high-pressure shear studies on single crystals. To
overcome these limitations, a new compact symmetric rotational diamond anvil
cell has been designed and developed for in situ high-pressure torsion studies
on materials. The symmetric angular opening and short working distance in this
new design help obtain a more reliable crystallographic orientation
distribution function and lattice strain states up to a large Q range. Here, we
present the advantages of the symmetric design with a few demonstrative
studies.

<h3>Particle imbalanced weakly interacting quantum droplets in one-dimension</h3>

<br>
<i>I. A. Englezos, P. Schmelcher, S. I. Mistakidis</i>
<p>We explore the formation of one-dimensional two-component quantum droplets
with intercomponent particle imbalance using an ab-initio many-body method. It
is shown that for moderate particle imbalance each component maintains its
droplet flat-top or Gaussian type character depending on the intercomponent
attraction. Importantly, large particle imbalance leads to a flat-top shape of
the majority component with the minority exhibiting spatially localized
configurations. The latter imprint modulations on the majority component which
become more pronounced for increasing interspecies attraction. The same holds
for larger mass or increasing repulsion of the minority species. Such
structural transitions are also evident in the underlying two-body correlation
functions. To interpret the origin and characteristics of these droplet states
we derive an effective model based on the established Lee-Huang-Yang theory
providing adequate qualitative analytical predictions even away from its
expected parametric region of validity. In contrast, the droplet character is
found to vanish in the presence of fermionic minority atoms. Our results pave
the way for unveiling complex droplet phases of matter.

<p>We present a minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) quantum
impurity solver for general multi-orbital systems at finite temperatures. We
introduce an improved estimator for the single-particle Green's function that
strongly reduces the large fluctuations at long imaginary time and low
temperature, which were a severe limitation of the original algorithm. In
combination with the fork tensor product states ansatz, we obtain a dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT) quantum impurity solver, which we benchmark for single
and three-band models down to low temperatures, including the effect of
spin-orbit coupling in a realistic DMFT computation for the Hund's metal

<h3>Generation of femtosecond spin-polarized current pulses at Fe/MgO  interface by quasi-static voltage</h3>

<br>
<i>Piotr Graczyk, Maria Pugaczowa-Michalska, Maciej Krawczyk</i>
<p>The generation of short spin-current pulses is essential for fast spintronic
devices. So far, spin current pulses are generated by femtosecond laser pulses
which drive spins from a ferromagnetic metal layer. However, the need for
miniaturization, simplicity and energy efficiency favour electric-field control
of spintronic devices over optic or thermal control. Here, we combine ab initio
calculations of electronic density of states at MgO/Fe interface with
continuous model for charge transport to investigate the dynamics of the
spin-dependent potential. We demonstrate that the voltage-driven instability of
the electronic band structure due to the electronic resonant states at the
Fe/MgO interface results in the generation of the femtosecond spin-polarized
current pulse with the spin polarization up to P=700% that propagates from the
interface to the bulk. The dynamics of the current pulses driven by the Stoner
instability depends neither on the dielectric relaxation time nor on the
details of how the instability is achieved by changing the voltage, i.e. as
long as the voltage changes are slow (quasi-static) with respect to the time
determined by the spin diffusion constant, being of the order of fs.The
presence of the instability may be detected by transport or magnetic
measurements.

<p>Transparent Conductors (TCs) exhibit optical transparency and electron
conductivity, and are essential for many opto-electronic and photo-voltaic
devices. The most common TCs are electron-doped oxides, which have few
limitations when transition metals are used as dopants. Non-oxides TCs have the
potential of extending the class of materials to the magnetic realm, bypass
technological bottlenecks, and bring TCs to the field of spintronics. Here we
propose new functional materials that combine transparency and conductivity
with magnetic spin polarization that can be used for spintronic applications,
such as spin filters. By using high-throughput first-principles techniques, we
identified a large number of potential TCs, including non-oxides materials. Our
results indicate that proper doping with transition metals introduces a finite
magnetization that can provide spin filtering up to 90% in the electrical
conductivity, still maintaining a transparency greater than 90%.

<p>The 8 eV first nuclear excited state in $^{229}$Th is a candidate for
implementing an nuclear clock. Doping $^{229}$Th into ionic crystals such as
CaF$_2$ is expected to suppress non-radiative decay, enabling nuclear
spectroscopy and the realization of a solid-state optical clock. Yet, the
inherent radioactivity of $^{229}$Th prohibits the growth of high-quality
single crystals with high $^{229}$Th concentration; radiolysis causes fluoride
loss, increasing absorption at 8 eV. We overcome this roadblock by annealing
$^{229}$Th doped CaF$_2$ at 1250$\unicode{x2103}$ in CF$_4$. The technique
presented here allows to adjust the fluoride content without crystal melting,
preserving its single-crystal structure. Superionic state annealing ensures
rapid fluoride distribution, creating fully transparent and radiation-hard
crystals. This approach enables control over the charge state of dopants which
can be used in deep UV optics, laser crystals, scintillators, and nuclear
clocks.

interferences in their two-body scattering dynamics and collisional rate
coefficients, at an electric field that produces a F\"orster resonance. This
proposal represents a feasible protocol to achieve coherent control on
ultracold molecular collisions in current experiments. It sets the basis for
future studies in which one can think to control the amount of each produced

<h3>Pattern formation in charge density wave states after a quantum quench</h3>

<i>Lingyu Yang, Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern</i>
<p>We study post-quench dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the
square-lattice $t$-$V$ model. The ground state of this system at half-filling
is characterized by a checkerboard modulation of particle density. A
generalized self-consistent mean-field method, based on the time-dependent
variational principle, is employed to describe the dynamical evolution of the
CDW states. Assuming a homogeneous CDW order throughout the quench process, the
time-dependent mean-field approach is reduced to the Anderson pseudospin
method. Quench simulations based on the Bloch equation for pseudospins produce
three canonical behaviors of order-parameter dynamics: phase-locked persistent
oscillation, Landau-damped oscillation, and dynamical vanishing of the CDW
order. We further develop an efficient real-space von Neumann equation method
to incorporate dynamical inhomogeneity into simulations of quantum quenches.
Our large-scale simulations uncover complex pattern formations in the
post-quench CDW states, especially in the strong quench regime. The emergent
spatial textures are characterized by super density modulations on top of the
short-period checkerboard CDW order. Our demonstration of pattern formation in
quenched CDW states, described by a simple broken $Z_2$ symmetry, underscores
the importance of dynamical inhomogeneity in quantum quenches of many-body
systems with more complex orders.

<i>Bao Chen, Kaiyun Pang, Ru Zheng, Feng Liu</i>
<p>The integration of topological concepts into electronic energy band theory
has been a transformative development in condensed matter physics. Since then,
this paradigm has broadened its reach, extending to a variety of physical
systems, including open ones. In this study, we employ analogues of the
generalized $n$-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a cornerstone in
understanding topological insulators and higher-order topological states, to
unveil a dimensional hierarchy of topological states within thermal diffusive
networks. Unlike their electronic counterparts, the topological states in these
networks are characterized by confined temperature profiles of dimension
$(n-d)$ with constant diffusive rates, where $n$ represents the system's
dimension and $d$ is the order of the topological state. Our findings
demonstrate the existence of topological corner states in thermal diffusive
systems up to $n=3$, along with surface and hinge states. We also identify and
discuss an intermediate-order topological phase in the case $n=3$,
characterized by the presence of hinge states but the absence of corner states.
Furthermore, our work delves into the influence of chiral symmetry in these
thermal networks, particularly focusing on topological thermal states with a
near-zero diffusion rate. This research lays the foundation for advanced
thermal management strategies that utilize topological states in multiple

<p>In Westminster Abbey, in a nave near to Newton's monument, lies a memorial
stone to Paul Dirac. The inscription on the stone includes the relativistic
wave equation for an electron: the Dirac equation. At the turn of the 21st
century, it was discovered that this eponymous equation was not simply the
preserve of particle physics. The isolation of graphene by Andre Geim and
Konstantin Novoselov in Manchester led to the exploration of a novel class of
materials - Dirac materials - whose electrons behave like Dirac particles.
While the mobility of these quasi-relativistic electrons is attractive from the
perspective of potential ultrafast devices, it also presents a distinct
challenge: how to confine Dirac particles so as to avoid making inherently
leaky devices? Here we discuss the unconventional quantum tunnelling of Dirac
particles, we explain a strategy to create bound states electrostatically, and

<h3>Microscopic Legendre Transform, Canonical Distribution and Jaynes'  Maximum Entropy Principle</h3>

<p>The equilibrium state of a closed system in contact with a heat reservoir can
be described in terms of the Helmholtz free energy ($F$). Mathematically, $F$
is related to the entropy ($S$) of the system by the Legendre transform where
the independent variable is changed from the energy ($U$) of the system to its
inverse temperature ($1/T$). This mathematical structure is preserved in the
statistical framework of canonical ensemble where the system energy and entropy
are defined in terms of expectation values over the canonical probability
distribution. In this paper, we present the microscopic form of the Legendre
transform ($\mathscr{L}_{\!\mathscr{M}}^{}$) by treating the microstate
probabilities and the energies (scaled by the inverse temperature) as conjugate
variables. The transform $\mathscr{L}_{\!\mathscr{M}}^{}$ requires that the
canonical entropy be redefined by explicitly incorporating the normalization
constraint on the probabilities and underscores the exact differential property
of the canonical entropy. Canonical distribution may be derived as a
consequence of this transform. Other approaches, in particular, Jaynes' maximum
entropy principle is compared with the present approach. The relevance of
$\mathscr{L}_{\!\mathscr{M}}^{}$ is explored based on the thermodynamics of a
system in contact with a heat reservoir.

<i>M. V. Kondrin, Y. B. Lebed</i>
<p>We investigated the influence of a finite number of computer simulations by
molecular dynamics method on fluctuations in thermodynamic properties. As a
case study, we used the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system. Besides being an
archetypal system, the 2D Lennard-Jones system is a subject of long debate, as
to whether its melting transition is continuous (infinite-order) or
discontinious ( first-order) one. We have discovered that anomalies on the
equation of state (the van-der-Waals or Myer-Wood loops) previously considered
a hallmark of first order phase transition, are at best at the level of noise,
since they have the same magnitude as the amplitude of pressure fluctuations.
Having calculated the dependence of temperature fluctuations on the number of
particles, we obtained another strong evidence of continuous character of this
melting transition, which manifests itself in continuous change of heat
capacity across the melting curve. We also compared the results obtained for
temperature fluctuations with prediction made by statistical mechanics .

<br>
<i>Tobias Kuhn, Björn Sothmann, Jorge Cayao</i>
<p>Higgs modes emerge in superconductors as collective excitations of the order
parameter amplitude when periodically driven by electromagnetic radiation. In
this work, we develop a Floquet approach to study Higgs modes in
superconductors under time-periodic driving, where the dynamics of the order
parameter is captured by anomalous Floquet Green's functions. We show that the
Floquet description is particularly powerful as it allows one to exploit the
time-periodic nature of the driving, thus considerably reducing the complexity
of the time-dependent problem. Interestingly, the Floquet approach is also
enlightening because it naturally offers a physical explanation for the
renormalized steady-state order parameter as a result of photon processes
between Floquet sidebands. We demonstrate the usefulness of Floquet engineering
Higgs modes in time-periodic $s$-wave superconductors.

<h3>Machine learning for viscoelastic constitutive model identification and  parameterisation using Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13793" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13793</a>
<br>
<i>TP John, M Mowbray, A Alalwyat, M Vousvoukis, P Martin, A Kowalski, CP Fonte</i>
<p>Identification and parameterisation of constitutive models can be a
challenging task in rheology. We investigate the use of Random Forest (RF)
regression to estimate viscoelastic constitutive model parameters using Large
Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) data. Specifically, we deploy the RF to
predict constitutive model parameters using the spectra of Chebyshev
coefficients pertaining to the stress-strain-strain rate Lissajous curves. As
far as we know, this is the first time Machine Learning (ML) has been utilised
for this predictive task. We test three constitutive models: the linear and
exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) models, and the RoLiE-Poly model. For both
PTT models, the RF estimator predicts the model parameters from the Chebyshev
spectra with high accuracy. For the RoLiE-Poly model, the RF estimator
demonstrates lower accuracy in model validation, however the predicted
parameters still accurately capture the rheological behaviour in both
oscillatory shear and oscillatory extensional flow. This is because multiple
sets of RoLiE-Poly model parameters can yield very similar rheological
responses and indicates practical identifiability issues under the investigated
conditions. This does not represent an inadequacy of the framework, but rather
a fundamental challenge in estimating model parameters using rheometric data.
Overall, the study highlights the strong potential ML has to offer for
selecting and parametrising constitutive models based on rheometry data. Our
results can help in allowing for widespread robust, modelling of viscoelastic
fluid flows.

<h3>Expanding the Pressure Frontier in Grüneisen Parameter Measurement:  Study of Sodium Chloride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13799" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13799</a>
<br>
<i>Jun Kong, Kaiyuan Shi, Xingbang Dong, Xiao Dong, Xin Zhang, Jiaqing Zhang, Lei Su, Guoqiang Yang</i>
<p>The Gr\"uneisen parameter ({\gamma}) is crucial for determining many thermal
properties, including the anharmonic effect, thermostatistics, and equation of
state (EOS) of materials. However, the isentropic adiabatic compression
conditions required to measure the Gr\"uneisen parameter under high pressure
are difficult to achieve. Thus, direct experimental Gr\"uneisen parameter data
in a wide range of pressures is sparse. In this work, we developed a new device
that can apply pressure (up to tens of GPa) with an extremely short time about
0.5 ms, confidently achieving isentropic adiabatic compression. Then, we
applied our new technique to sodium chloride and measured its Gr\"uneisen
parameter, which conforms to previous theoretical predictions. According to our
obtained sodium chloride Gr\"uneisen parameters, the calculated Hugoniot curve
of the NaCl B1 phase appears up to 20 GPa and 960 K, which compares very well
with the shock compression experiment data by Fritz et al. and other
calculation works. Our results suggest that this new method can reliably
measure the Gr\"uneisen parameter of even more materials, which is significant
for researching the equation of state in substances.

<h3>Wigner representation of Andreev-reflected charge pulses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13829</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Roussel, Pablo Burset, Christian Flindt</i>
<p>Recent experiments have shown that the edge states of a quantum Hall sample
can be coupled to a superconductor, so that incoming electrons in the edge
states can be Andreev converted on the superconductor as coherent
superpositions of an electron and a hole. In addition to this, single-electron
emitters that operate in the gigahertz regime have been realized. Motivated by
this remarkable experimental progress, we here analyze the Andreev reflections
of incoming charge pulses on the interface with a superconductor. To this end,
we employ a Wigner function representation that allows us to visualize the
response function of the interface both in the time and in the frequency
domain. We analyze the response of an interface between a normal-metal and a
singlet or triplet superconductor with and without an insulating barrier in
between them. As a special case, we analyze the Andreev reflections of clean
single-particle excitations that are generated by the application of
lorentzian-shaped voltage pulses to the contacts of the inputs. Our predictions
may be tested in future experiments with edge states coupled to
superconductors.

<br>
<i>Jonas Lidal, Jeroen Danon</i>
<p>We use a single-channel scattering formalism to derive general expressions
for the Andreev bound-state energies and resulting current--phase relationship
in a one-dimensional semiconductor-based SNS-junction, including arbitrarily
oriented effective spin--orbit and Zeeman fields and taking into account
disorder in the junction in by including a single scatterer with transmission
probability $0 \leq T^2 \leq 1$, arbitrarily located in the normal region. We
first corroborate our results by comparing them to the known analytic
limiting-case expressions. Then we simplify our general result in several
additional limits, including the case of the scatterer being at a specific
location and the cases of small and large spin--orbit fields compared to the
Zeeman splitting, assuming low transparency ($T\ll 1$). We believe that our
results could be helpful for disentangling the main spin-mixing processes in
experiments on low-dimensional semiconductor-based SNS-junctions.

<h3>Self-diffusion coefficient as a function of the thermodynamic factor</h3>

<br>
<i>Melina Sampayo Puelles, Miguel Hoyuelos</i>
<p>Much effort has been put into developing theories for dense fluids, as a
result of these efforts many theories work for a certain type of particle or in
a certain concentration regime. Rosenfeld proposed a dependence of the
self-diffusion coefficient on the excess entropy. Our proposal is similar to
Rosenfeld's in that it also attempts to describe diffusion in terms of a
thermodynamic function but, instead of the excess entropy, we use the
thermodynamic factor, or the excess chemical potential. Simulations were taken
for hard spheres and our model was fitted with two free parameters. Simulations
were then carried out for a Lennard Jones gas and our model correctly described
the new data with the value of the free parameters that we had obtained for
hard spheres. This is a feature of our model that we wish to emphasize, since
the usual situation is that parameters have to be re-adjusted for different
interaction potentials. An experimental xenon self-diffusion data set was used
as an example where the model can be applied, especially in the high-density
regime.

<h3>Enhanced elastic stability of a topologically disordered crystalline  metal--organic framework</h3>

<br>
<i>Emily G. Meekel, Phillippa Partridge, Robert A. I. Paraoan, Joshua J. B. Levinsky, Ben Slater, Claire L. Hobday, Andrew L. Goodwin</i>
<p>By virtue of their open network structures and low densities, metal--organic
frameworks (MOFs) are soft materials that exhibit elastic instabilities at low
applied stresses. The conventional strategy for improving elastic stability is
to increase the connectivity of the underlying MOF network, which necessarily
increases material density and reduces porosity. Here we demonstrate an
alternative paradigm, whereby elastic stability is enhanced in a MOF with an
aperiodic network topology. We use a combination of variable-pressure
single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements and coarse-grained
lattice-dynamical calculations to interrogate the high-pressure behaviour of
the topologically aperiodic system TRUMOF-1, which we compare against that of
its ordered congener MOF-5. We show that the topology of the former quenches
the elastic instability responsible for pressure-induced framework collapse in
the latter, much as irregularity in the shapes and sizes of stones acts to
prevent cooperative mechanical failure in drystone walls. Our results establish
aperiodicity as a counterintuitive design motif in engineering the mechanical
properties of framework structures, relevant to MOFs and larger-scale
architectures alike.

<h3>Polarization multistates in antiferroelectric van der Waals materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13856" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13856</a>
<br>
<i>Guoliang Yu, Shengxian Li, Anlian Pan, Mingxing Chen, Zhenyu Zhang</i>
<p>The bistability of charge polarization in ferroelectric materials has long
been the basis of ferroelectric devices. However, the ferroelectricity tends to
be vanishing as the thickness of materials is reduced to a few nanometers or
thinner due to the depolarization field. Instead, they show a paraelectric or
an antiferroelectric ordering in the ultra-thin limit, which is unfavorable for
their applications in devices. Here we uncover polarization multistates in thin
films of van der Waals materials, in which the individual monolayers have an
antiferroelectric ordering with out-of-plane polarizations. This property
results from a unique combination of the polarization and layer degrees of
freedom. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that bilayers and
trilayers of the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ family possess quintuple and septuple
polarization states., respectively. Our climbing image nudged elastic band
calculations for the bilayers and trilayers of CuInP$_2$S$_6$ and
CuCrP$_2$S$_6$ further show that the states can be transformed into each other
under appropriate external electric fields, for which a unique layer-selective
half-layer-by-half-layer flipping mechanism governs the transformings. Our
study opens up a door to design unusual polarization states using intrinsic
degrees of freedom of layered antiferroelectrics for the next-generation
ferroelectric devices that go beyond the bistability paradigm.

<h3>Superconducting diodes from magnetization gradients</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13857" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13857</a>
<br>
<i>Mercè Roig, Panagiotis Kotetes, Brian M. Andersen</i>
<p>The superconducting diode effect may exist in bulk systems as well as in
junctions when time-reversal and inversion symmetries are simultaneously
broken. Magnetization gradients and textures satisfy both requirements and
therefore also allow for superconducting diodes. We concretely demonstrate such
possibilities in two-dimensional superconductors. We first consider
superconducting Rashba metals in the presence of an inhomogeneous out-of-plane
exchange field. Using analytical arguments, we reveal that such magnetization
gradients stabilize a helical superconducting ground state, similar to
homogeneous in-plane magnetic fields. Our predictions are confirmed by
employing self-consistent real-space numerical lattice simulations exemplified
through the cases of a uniform magnetization gradient or a ferromagnetic domain
wall. Furthermore, by considering a phase difference, we determine the
nonreciprocal current-phase relations and explore their parameter dependence.
Our calculations show that planar devices with out-of-plane magnetization
gradients may be as efficient supercurrent rectifiers as their analogs induced
by uniform in-plane fields. In addition, they feature the advantage that by
means of tailoring the spatial profile of the out-of-plane magnetization, one
may optimize and spatially control the diode effect. Finally, we show that
superconducting diodes may become also accessible even in the absence of
spin-orbit coupling by means of suitable spatially-varying magnetization
fields.

<h3>Electric dipole spin resonance in single and two electron quantum dot  defined in two-dimensional electron gas at the SrTiO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13862</a>
<br>
<i>B.Szafran, M.Zegrodnik. M.P.Nowak, R. Citro, P. Wójcik</i>
<p>We investigate the energy spectrum of a single and two electron quantum dot
(QD) embedded in two dimensional electron gas at the interface between
SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$, in the presence of the external magnetic field. For
this purpose the three band model of $3d$-electrons defined on the square
lattice of Ti ions was utilized. We demonstrate that, for the weak parabolic
confinement potential, the low energy spectrum is sufficiently well described
by the effective Hamiltonian reduced to the one $d_{xy}$ orbital with the
spin-orbit interaction originating from the coupling to the $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$
bands. This is not the case for stronger confinement where contribution of the
states related to the $d_{xz/yz}$ orbital is relevant. Based on the time
depended calculations we discuss in details the manipulation of the electron
spin in QD by external AC voltages, in the context of the electric dipole spin
resonance. The allowed and forbidden transitions are discussed in details with
respect to the parity selection rule. Our calculations show that for a single
electron QD the spin-flip in the ground-state has a character of a Rabi
resonance while for two electrons the singlet-triplet transition is forbidden
by the parity symmetry. For the two electrons QD, we demonstrate that the
spin-flip transition can still be accomplished via a second-order, two-photon
process that has a two-state Rabi character for low AC field amplitude. The
violation of the parity symmetry on the spin-flip transitions is also analyzed.

<h3>Direct evidence from high-field magnetotransport for a dramatic change  of quasiparticle character in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Shroya Vaidya, Matthew J. Coak, Daniel A. Mayoh, Martin R. Lees, Geetha Balakrishnan, John Singleton, Paul A. Goddard</i>
<p>Magnetometry and magnetoresistance (MR) data taken on the van der Waals
ferromagnet Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ (FGT) reveal three distinct contributions to the
MR: a linear negative component, a contribution from closed Fermi-surface
orbits, and a $H^2$ enhancement linked to a non-coplanar spin arrangement.
Contrary to earlier studies on FGT, by accounting for the field dependence of
the anomalous Hall effect, we find that the ordinary Hall coefficient decreases
markedly below 80 K, indicating a significant change in character of the
electrons and holes on the Fermi surface at this temperature. The resulting
altered ground state eventually causes the Hall coefficient to reverse sign at
35 K. Our Hall data support the proposal that Kondo-lattice behavior develops
in this $d$-electron material below 80 K. Additional evidence comes from the
negative linear component of the MR, which arises from electron-magnon
scattering with an atypical temperature dependence attributable to the onset of
Kondo screening.

<h3>Topological Phase Transitions with Zero Indirect Band Gap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13907" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13907</a>
<br>
<i>Giandomenico Palumbo</i>
<p>Topological phase transitions in band models are usually associated to the
gap closing between the highest valance band and the lowest conduction band,
which can give rise to different types of nodal structures, such as Dirac/Weyl
points, lines and surfaces. In this work, we show the existence of a different
kind of topological phase transitions in one-dimensional systems, which are
instead characterized by the presence of a robust zero indirect gap, which
occurs when the top of the valence band coincides with the bottom of the
conduction band in energy but not in momentum. More specifically, we consider
an one-dimensional model on a diamond-like chain that is protected by both
particle-hole and chiral-inversion symmetries. At the critical point, the
system supports a Dirac-like point. After introducing a deforming parameter
that breaks both inversion and chiral symmetries but preserves their
combination, we observe the emergence of a zero indirect band gap, which
results to be related to the persymmetry of our Hamiltonian. Importantly, the
zero indirect gap holds for a range of values of the deforming parameter. We
finally discuss the implementation of the deforming parameter in our
tight-binding model through time-periodic (Floquet) driving.

<h3>Transient amplification of broken symmetry in elastic snap-through</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13908</a>
<br>
<i>Qiong Wang, Andrea Giudici, Weicheng Huang, Yuzhe Wang, Mingchao Liu, Sameh Tawfick, Dominic Vella</i>
<p>Snap-through can occur when a bistable structure suddenly loses one of its
stable states and moves rapidly to the remaining state. We observe
experimentally that as a symmetrically-buckled arch snaps between the two
states, it sometimes transits through an asymmetric shape; other times it
remains symmetric throughout the motion. Using experiments, numerics and a toy
model, we show that the \emph{rate} at which the snap-through transition is
traversed qualitatively affects the behavior of an elastic arch with symmetric
boundary conditions: slow loading leads to asymmetric snap-through while faster
loading leads to a symmetric snap-through. We show for the toy model that this
surprising behavior is caused by a region of the system's state space in which
any asymmetry in the initial shape is amplified. The system may not traverse
this region at all (fast loading), hence remaining symmetric. For sufficiently
slow loading, however, the system traverses this amplification region for some
interval of time; as a result, the amplification of asymmetry is observed only
transiently and has a larger effect the smaller the loading rate.

<i>Peng-Jie Guo, Yuhao Gu, Ze-Feng Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<p>Altermagnetism is a new magnetic phase with k-dependent spin polarization and
may exist in an insulating state with a high N\'eel temperature. This provides
a new opportunity to obtain both spin and electric polarization in one
material. Here, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic
structures calculations, we predict that LiFe2F6 is a d-wave altermagnetic and
charge-ordering-mediated ferroelectric material. Moreover, the LiFe2F6
transforms into a ferrimagnetic and ferroelectric phase with strong
magnetoelectric coupling under biaxial compressive strain. Interestingly, the
spins of the valence band and the conduction band are opposite in ferrimagnetic
LiFe2F6, which facilitates a simultaneous spin-triplet excitonic insulator
phase. More importantly, the spin-triplet excitons with spin 1 and -1 can be
switched by electric fields in ferrimagnetic LiFe2F6 due to strong
magnetoelectric coupling. Due to the abundance of novel physical properties,
LiFe2F6 will certainly attract a wide range of theoretical and experimental
interest.

<h3>Energy barriers of Be and B in passing through the C60 fullerene cage</h3>

<br>
<i>A. V. Bibikov, A. V. Nikolaev, P. V. Borisyuk, E. V. Tkalya</i>
<p>We have studied the potential barriers for the penetration of atomic
beryllium or boron inside the C60 fullerene by performing ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) calculations with three variants for the exchange and
correlation: B3LYP (hybrid functional), PW91 and PBE. Four principal
trajectories to the inner part of C60 for the penetrating atom have been
considered: through the center of six-member-carbon ring (hexagon),
five-member-carbon ring (pentagon), and also through the center of the double
C-C bond (D-bond) and the center of the single C-C bond (S-bond). Averaging
over the three DFT variants yields the following barriers for beryllium
penetrating inside a deformable fullerene: 3.2 eV (hexagon), 4.8 eV (S-bond),
5.3 eV (D-bond), 5.9~eV (pentagon). These barriers correspond to the slow and
adiabatic penetration of Be, in contrast to the fast (non-adiabatic)
penetration through the rigid cage of C60 resulting in 5.6 eV (hexagon), 16.3
eV (pentagon), 81.8 eV (S-bond) and 93.4 eV (D-bond). The potential barriers
for the boron penetrating inside deformable/rigid C60 are: 3.7/105.4 eV
(D-bond), 4.0/86.8 eV (S-bond), 4.7/7.8 eV (hexagon), 6.8/14.0 eV (pentagon).
The potential barriers for Be and B escaping from the inner part of C$_{60}$
are higher by the value of 0.84 eV for Be and 0.81 eV for B. The considerable
reduction of the potential barriers for the deformable fullerene is ascribed to
the formation of the Be-C and B-C bonds. We discuss the difference between Be
and B, compare three variants of DFT, and analyze the role of the dispersion
interaction.

<p>Quantum transport properties in molecularly thin perovskite/graphene
heterostructure are experimentally investigated by Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH)
oscillation and photo-resistance spectroscopy. We find an efficient charge
transfer between the perovskite nanosheets and graphene, with a high hole
concentration in graphene of up to $\rm \sim 2.8 \times 10^{13}\ cm^{-2}$. The
perovskite layer also increases Fermi velocity lowering the effective mass of
graphene from expected $\rm \sim 0.12\ m_e$ to $\rm \sim 0.08\ m_e$. Combining
magneto-resistance and density functional theory calculations, we find that the
carrier density in graphene significantly depends on the perovskite termination
at the interface, affecting the charge transfer process and leading to a
coexistence of regions with different doping. We also investigate the
photo-response of the SdH oscillation under illumination. Using
photo-resistance spectroscopy, we find evidence of photo-assisted transport
across the perovskite layer between two graphene electrodes mediated by hot
carriers in perovskite. Our results provide a picture to understand the
transport behavior of 2D perovskite/graphene heterostructure and a reference
for the controlled design of interfaces in perovskite optoelectronic devices.

<i>Théo Malas-Danzé, Alexandre Dugelay, Nir Navon, Hadrien Kurkjian</i>
<p>We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of
spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin
states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a
state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted
via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the
pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected
in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation
times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed
pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the
interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an
overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.

<i>Francesco Cassol, Léo Gaspard, Michele Casula, Cyril Martins, Benjamin Lenz</i>
<p>In the quest of new exotic phases of matter due to the interplay of various
interactions, iridates hosting a spin-orbit entangled $j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$
ground state have been in the spotlight in recent years. Also in view of
parallels with the low-energy physics of high-temperature superconducting
cuprates, the validity of a single- or few-band picture in terms of the
$j_{\mathrm{eff}}$ states is key. However, in particular for its structurally
simple member Ba$_2$IrO$_4$, such a systematic construction and subsequent
analysis of minimal low-energy models are still missing. Here we show by means
of a combination of different ab initio techniques with dynamical mean-field
theory that a three-band model in terms of Ir-$j_{\mathrm{eff}}$ states fully
retains the low-energy physics of the system as compared to a full Ir-$5d$
model. Providing a detailed study of the three-band model in terms of
spin-orbit coupling, Hund's coupling and Coulomb interactions, we map out a
rich phase diagram and identify a region of effective one-band metal-insulator
transition relevant to Ba$_2$IrO$_4$. Compared to available angle-resolved
photoemission spectra, we find good agreement of salient aspects of the
calculated spectral function and identify features which require the inclusion
of non-local fluctuations. In a broader context, we envisage the three- and
five-band models developed in this study to be relevant for the study of doped
Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and to clarify further the similarities and differences with
cuprates.

<i>Eric Bertin, Alexandre Solon</i>
<p>We propose a one-dimensional model of active particles interpolating between
quorum sensing models used in the study of motility-induced phase separation
(MIPS) and models of congestion of traffic flow on a single-lane highway.
Particles have a target velocity with a density-dependent magnitude and a
direction that flips with a finite rate that is biased toward moving right. Two
key parameters are the bias and the speed relaxation time. MIPS is known to
occur in such models at zero bias and zero relaxation time (overdamped
dynamics), while a fully biased motion with no velocity reversal models traffic
flow on a highway. Using both numerical simulations and continuum equations
derived from the microscopic dynamics, we show that a single phase-separated
state extends from the usual MIPS to congested traffic flow in the phase
diagram defined by the bias and the speed relaxation time. However, in the
fully biased case, inertia is essential to observe phase separation, making
MIPS and congested traffic flow seemingly different phenomena if not
simultaneously considering inertia and tumbling. We characterize the velocity
of the dense phase, which is static for usual MIPS and moves backwards in
traffic congestion. We also find that in presence of bias, the phase diagram
becomes richer, with an additional transition between phase separation and a
microphase separation that is seen above a threshold bias or relaxation rate.

<h3>The effect of stochastic resettings on the counting of level crossings  for inertial random processes</h3>

<i>Miquel Montero, Matteo Palassini, Jaume Masoliver</i>
<p>We study the counting of level crossings for inertial random processes
exposed to stochastic resetting events. We develop the general approach of
stochastic resetting for inertial processes with sudden changes in the state
characterized by position and velocity. We obtain the level-crossing intensity
in terms of that of underlying reset-free process, for resetting events with
Poissonian statistics. We apply this result to the random acceleration process
and the inertial Brownian motion. In both cases, we show that there is an
optimal resetting rate that maximizes the crossing intensity, and we obtain the
asymptotic behavior of the crossing intensity for large and small resetting
rates. Finally, we discuss the stationary distribution and the mean
first-arrival time in the presence of resetting.

<h3>Tensor Network Finite-Size Scaling for Two-Dimensional 3-state Clock  Model</h3>

<i>Debasmita Maiti, Sing-Hong Chan, Pochung Chen</i>
<p>We benchmark recently proposed tensor network based finite-size scaling
analysis in Phys. Rev. B 107, 205123 (2023) against two-dimensional classical
3-state clock model. Due to the higher complexity of the model, more
complicated crossover behavior is observed. We advocate that the crossover
behavior can be understood from the perspective of finite bond dimension
inducing relevant perturbation. This leads to a general strategy to best
estimate the critical properties for a given set of control parameters.For the
critical temperature $T_c$, the error at the order of $10^{-6}$ can be reached
with bond dimension $D=70$. On the other hand, with bond dimension $D=60$, the
error of the critical exponents $\nu, \beta, \alpha$ is at the order of
$10^{-3}$.Increasing the bond dimension to $D=90$, the error of $\nu$ and
$\beta$ can be reduced to the order of $10^{-4}$, but for some calculations
numerical instability starts to emerge. In all cases our results indicate that
the errors can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimension and
the stacking number.

<h3>Control of threshold voltages in Si/SiGe quantum devices via optical  illumination</h3>

<p>Optical illumination of quantum-dot qubit devices at cryogenic temperatures,
while not well studied, is often used to recover operating conditions after
undesired shocking events or charge injection. Here, we demonstrate systematic
threshold voltage shifts in a dopant-free, Si/SiGe field effect transistor
using a near infrared (780 nm) laser diode. We find that illumination under an
applied gate voltage can be used to set a specific, stable, and reproducible
threshold voltage that, over a wide range in gate bias, is equal to that gate
bias. Outside this range, the threshold voltage can still be tuned, although
the resulting threshold voltage is no longer equal to the applied gate bias
during illumination. We present a simple and intuitive model that provides a
mechanism for the tunability in gate bias. The model presented also explains
why cryogenic illumination is successful at resetting quantum dot qubit devices
after undesired charging events.

<i>Ankit Sharma, Animesh Datta, Uttam Singisetti</i>
<p>In this work, the Effective Phonon Dispersion of $\beta$-
(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ alloy is investigated using the Phonon unfolding
formalism. To capture the true randomness of the system, supercells are
designed using the technique of special quasirandom structues. The phonon
unfolding technique is then used to obtain the effective phonon dispersion
(EPD) for aluminium fractions of 18.75 \% and 37.5 \% with respect to gallium
atoms. The impact of disorder on the high frequency and DC dielectric constant
is also investigated. The unfolding procedure was also applied to the dipole
moment where the projection probability was used to obtain the IR spectra of
the disordered system. The calculated properties gives us further insights to
calculate the transport properties in these alloy semiconductors while
capturing the true randomness of the system.

<h3>Non-Fermi liquid fixed point of the dissipative Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev  model</h3>

<br>
<i>Niklas Cichutek, Andreas Rückriegel, Peter Kopietz</i>
<p>Using a functional renormalization group approach we derive the
renormalization group (RG) flow of a dissipative variant of the
Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing $N$ fermions on a quantum dot which
interact via a disorder-induced Yukawa coupling with $M$ bosons. The inverse
Euclidean propagator of the bosons is assumed to exhibit a non-analytic term
proportional to the modulus of the Matsubara frequency. We show that, to
leading order in $1/N$ and $1/M$, the hierarchy of formally exact flow
equations for the irreducible vertices of the disorder-averaged model can be
closed at the level of the two-point vertices. We find that the RG flow
exhibits a non-Fermi liquid fixed point where the anomalous dimension $\eta$ of
the fermions and the anomalous dimension $\gamma$ of the bosons satisfy the
scaling law $2 = 2 \eta + \gamma$, where $ 0 < \eta < 1/2$. We explicitly
calculate $\eta$ and the critical exponents characterizing the linearized RG
flow in the vicinity of the fixed point as functions of $N/M$.

<h3>Hidden mechanical oscillatory state in a carbon nanotube revealed by  noise</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Belardinelli, W. Yang, A. Bachtold, M.I. Dykman, F. Alijani</i>
<p>Carbon nanotubes are devices of choice for investigating the interplay
between electronic transport and nanomechanical motion. In this work, we report
the co-existence of thermal vibrations and large-amplitude self-sustained
oscillations in a carbon nanotube that originates from electron tunneling and
thermal effects. The measured transitions between the two states are described
by a Poisson process, revealing that the interstate switching is induced by
noise. We observe the coexistence of the stable low-amplitude thermal state and
the stable large-amplitude state (limit cycle) over a finite parameter range,
which points to an isola bifurcation. We propose a minimalistic model based on
nonlinear friction to account for the isola. Our work provides evidence for a
new type of bifurcation leading to self-sustained oscillations that largely
differs from the classical Hopf bifurcation, since these large-amplitude
oscillations are a hidden state that can be unveiled via stochastic switching.
We envision that this new dynamical regime and the means to reveal it will be
of interest for various mesoscopic vibrational systems.

<p>In our combined experimental, theoretical and numerical work, we study the
out of equilibrium deformations in a shrinking ring of optically trapped,
interacting colloidal particles. Steerable optical tweezers are used to confine
dielectric microparticles along a circle of discrete harmonic potential wells,
and to reduce the ring radius at a controlled quench speed. We show that
excluded-volume interactions are enough to induce particle sliding from their
equilibrium positions and nonequilibrium zigzag roughening of the colloidal
structure. Our work unveils the underlying mechanism of interfacial deformation
in radially driven microscopic discrete rings.

<h3>Theory of interlayer exciton dynamics in 2D TMDCs Heterolayers under the  influence of strain reconstruction and disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14054</a>
<br>
<i>Marten Richter</i>
<p>Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) became one of the most
studied nanostructures in the last decade. Combining two different TMDC
monolayers results in a heterostructure whose properties can be individually
tuned by the twist angle between the lattices of the two van-der-Waals layers
and the relative placement of the layers, leading to Moir\'e cells. For small
twist angles, lattice reconstruction leads to strong strain fields in the
Moir\'e cells. In this paper, we combine an existing theory for lattice
reconstruction with a quantum dynamic theory for interlayer excitons and their
dynamics due to exciton phonon scattering using a polaron transformation. The
exciton theory is formulated in real space instead of the commonly used
quasi-momentum space to account for imperfections in the heterolayer breaking
lattice translational symmetry. We can analyze the structure of the localized
and delocalized exciton states and their exciton-phonon scattering rates for
single phonon processes using Born-Markov approximation and multi-phonon
processes using a polaron transformation. Furthermore, linear optical spectra
and exciton relaxation Green functions are calculated and discussed.

<i>Asmae Benhemou, Georgia Nixon, Aydin Deger, Ulrich Schneider, Jiannis K. Pachos</i>
<p>In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to
distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation. Here, we present a scheme for an
analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1)- dimensional black holes using ultracold
atoms in a locally Floquet-driven 1D optical lattice. We show how the effective
dynamics of the driven system can generate a position-dependent tunnelling
profile that encodes the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we
provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of the
simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements.
Finally, we show how this scheme can be directly applied to simulate (2 + 1)D
black holes by utilising 2D optical lattices. By incorporating the effect of
atom-atom interactions, our simulator can probe the scrambling of quantum
information which is a fundamental property of black holes.

<h3>Pseudo-spectral Landau-Lifshitz description of magnetization dynamics</h3>

<p>Magnetic materials host a wealth of nonlinear dynamics, textures, and
topological defects. This is possible due to the competition between strong
nonlinearity and dispersion that act at the atomic scale as well as long-range
interactions. However, these features are difficult to analytically and
numerically study because of the vastly different temporal and spatial scales
involved. Here, we present a pseudo-spectral approach for the Landau-Lifshitz
equation that invokes energy and momentum conservation embodied in the magnon
dispersion relation to accurately describe both atomic and continuum limits.
Furthermore, this approach enables analytical study at every scale. We show the
applicability of this model in both the continuum and atomic limit by
investigating modulational instability and ultrafast evolution of magnetization
due to transient grating, respectively, in a 1D ferromagnetic chain with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This model provides the possibility of
grid-independent multiscale numerical approaches that will enable the
description of singularities within a single framework.

<h3>Josephson diode effect in junctions of superconductors with band  asymmetric metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Abhiram Soori</i>
<p>At the interfaces connecting two superconductors (SCs) separated by a
metallic layer, an electric current is induced when there is a disparity in the
phases of the two superconductors. We explain this phenomenon based on the
weights of the Andreev bound states associated with the states carrying current
in forward and reverse directions. Typically, the current phase relation (CPR)
in Josephson junctions is an odd function. When time reversal and inversion
symmetries are broken at the junction, CPR ceases to be an odd function and the
system exhibits Josephson diode effect. This phenomenon has been studied in
spin orbit coupled systems under an external Zeeman field wherein the
magnetochiral anisotropy is responsible for the Josephson diode effect.
Recently, a new model of band asymmetric metal (BAM) is proposed in which the
bandstructure is asymmetric. We investigate DC Josephson effect in SC-BAM-SC
junctions and find that band asymmetry can lead to Josephson diode effect. We
explain the mechanism behind Josephson diode effect in these systems based on
interference of plane wave modes within the Bogoliubov de-Genne formalism. We
calculate diode effect coefficient for different values of the parameters.

<i>Henning Schlömer, Fabian Grusdt, Ulrich Schollwöck, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Annabelle Bohrdt</i>
<p>The physics of doped Mott insulators is at the heart of strongly correlated
materials and is believed to constitute an essential ingredient for
high-temperature superconductivity. In systems with higher SU(N) spin
symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one
particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon
doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a
single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features
long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical
properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the
appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects,
whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered
diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string
theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With
recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models
with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed
in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the
appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent,
coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards
exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various
geometries.

<p>Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and
offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state
entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of
mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic
systems remains unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed
density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to the reduced density matrix,
can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions,
enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the
determinantal quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation
of rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the
spinless $t$-$V$ model and find that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi
negativity has a singularity at the finite-temperature transition point. Our
work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for
future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed
states.

<p>The relation between d-wave superconductivity and stripes is fundamental to
the understanding of ordered phases in cuprates. While experimentally both
phases are found in close proximity, numerical studies on the related
Fermi-Hubbard model have long been investigating whether stripes precede,
compete or coexist with superconductivity. Such stripes are characterised by
interleaved charge and spin density wave ordering where fluctuating lines of
dopants separate domains of opposite antiferromagnetic order. Here we show
first signatures of stripes in a cold-atom Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator. By
engineering a mixed-dimensional system, we increase their typical energy scales
to the spin exchange energy, enabling us to access the interesting crossover
temperature regime where stripes begin to form. We observe extended, attractive
correlations between hole dopants and find an increased probability to form
larger structures akin to stripes. In the spin sector, we study correlation
functions up to third order and find results consistent with stripe formation.
These higher-order correlation measurements pave the way towards an improved
microscopic understanding of the emergent properties of stripes and their
relation to other competing phases. More generally, our approach has direct
relevance for newly discovered high-temperature superconducting materials in
which mixed dimensions play an essential role.
