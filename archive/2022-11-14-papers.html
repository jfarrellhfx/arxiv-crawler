<h3>Spontaneous symmetry breaking of dual-layer solitons in  spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05841</a>
<br>

It is known that stable 2D solitons of the semi-vortex (SV) and mixed-mode
(MM) types are maintained by the interplay of the cubic attractive nonlinearity
and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in binary Bose-Einstein condensates. We introduce
a double-layer system, in which two binary condensates, stabilized by the SOC,
are linearly coupled by tunneling. By means of the numerical methods, it is
found that symmetric two-layer solitons undergo the
spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) bifurcation of the subcritical type. The
bifurcation produces families of asymmetric 2D solitons, which exist up to the
value of the total norm equal to the norm of the Townes solitons, above which
the collapse occurs. This situation terminates at a critical value of the
inter-layer coupling, beyond which the SSB bifurcation is absent, as the
collapse sets in earlier. Symmetric 2D solitons that are destabilized by the
SSB demonstrate dynamical symmetry breaking, in combination with intrinsic
oscillations of the solitons, or transition to the collapse, if the soliton's
norm is sufficiently large. Asymmetric MMs produced by the SSB instability
start spontaneous drift, in addition to the intrinsic vibrations. Consideration
of moving 2D solitons is a nontrivial problem because SOC breaks the Galilean
invariance. It is found that the system supports moving MMs up to a critical
value of the velocity, beyond which they undergo delocalization.

<h3>Dynamical formation of two-fold fragmented many-body state induced by an  impurity in a double-well</h3>

We unravel the correlated quantum quench dynamics of a single impurity
immersed in a bosonic environment confined in an one-dimensional double-well
potential. A particular emphasis is placed on the structure of the time-evolved
many-body wave function by relying on a Schmidt decomposition whose
coefficients directly quantify the number of configurations that are
macroscopically populated. For a non-interacting bosonic bath and weak
postquench impurity-bath interactions, we observe the dynamical formation of a
two-fold fragmented many-body state which is related to intra-band excitation
processes of the impurity and manifests as a two-body phase separation
(clustering) between the two species for repulsive (attractive) interactions.
Increasing the postquench impurity-bath coupling strength leads to the
destruction of the two-fold fragmentation since the impurity undergoes
additional inter-band excitation dynamics. By contrast, a weakly interacting
bath suppresses excitations of the bath particles and consequently the system
attains a weakly fragmented many-body state. Our results explicate the
interplay of intra- and inter-band impurity excitations for the dynamical
generation of fragmented many-body states in multi-well traps and for designing
specific entangled impurity states.

<h3>Effective binding potential from Casimir interactions: the case of the  Bose gas</h3>

We consider the thermal Casimir effect in ideal Bose gases, where the
dispersion relation involves both terms quadratic and quartic in momentum. We
demonstrate that if macroscopic objects are immersed in such a fluid in spatial
dimensionality $d\in\{3,7, 11, \dots\}$ and at the critical temperature $T_c$,
the Casimir force acting between them is characterized by a sign which depends
on the separation $D$ between the bodies and changes from attractive at large
distances to repulsive at smaller separations. In consequence, an effective
potential which binds the two objects at a finite separation arises. We
demonstrate that for odd integer dimensionality $d\in \{3, 5, 7, \dots\}$, the
Casimir energy is a polynomial of degree $(d-1)$ in $D^{-2}$. We point out a
very special role of dimensionality $d=3$, where we derive a strikingly simple
form of the Casimir energy as a function of $D$ at Bose-Einstein condensation.
We discuss crossover between monotonous and oscillatory decay of the Casimir
interaction above the condensation temperature.

<h3>Synthesis and physical properties of uranium thin-film hydrides UH2 and  \b{eta}-UH3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Formation of thin uranium hydrides films, UH2 and \b{eta}-UH3, synthesized by
a reactive dc sputtering of uranium metal, was explored using variable
deposition conditions. Obtained stable oxygen-free hydride films were studied
by a variety of methods, both in situ (photoelectron spectroscopy - XPS), and
ex-situ (x-ray diffraction - XRD, transmission electron microscopy - TEM),
electrical resistivity, and magnetometry). Both types of hydrides are
ferromagnetic, the Curie temperatures of UH2 and \b{eta}-UH3 are approx. 120
and 170 K, respectively. Ferromagnetism in the thin films is robust and does
not depend on structure details while electrical resistivity data reflect
disorder in both types of hydrides.

<h3>Boltzmann's entropy during free expansion of an interacting ideal gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06145" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06145</a>
<br>
<i>Subhadip Chakraborti, Abhishek Dhar, Anupam Kundu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we study the evolution of Boltzmann's entropy in the context of
free expansion of a one dimensional interacting gas inside a box. Boltzmann's
entropy is defined for single microstates and is given by the phase-space
volume occupied by microstates with the same value of macrovariables which are
coarse-grained physical observables. We demonstrate the idea of typicality in
the growth of the Boltzmann's entropy for two choices of macro-variables -- the
single particle phase space distribution and the hydrodynamic fields. Due to
the presence of interaction, the growth curves for both these entropies are
observed to converge to a monotonically increasing limiting curve, on taking
the appropriate order of limits, of large system size and small coarse graining
scale. Moreover, we observe that the limiting growth curves for the two choices
of entropies are identical as implied by local thermal equilibrium. We also
discuss issues related to finite size and finite coarse gaining scale which
lead interesting features such as oscillations in the entropy growth curve. We
also discuss shocks observed in the hydrodynamic fields.

<h3>Density control of GaN nanowires at the wafer scale using self-assembled  SiN$_x$ patches on sputtered TiN(111)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06274" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06274</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Auzelle, Miriam Oliva, Philipp John, Manfred Ramsteiner, Lutz Geelhaar, Oliver Brandt</i>
<br>
<br>
The self-assembly of heteroepitaxial GaN nanowires using either molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) mostly results
in wafer-scale ensembles with ultrahigh ($>10$\,$\mu$m$^{-2}$) or ultralow
($<1$\,$\mu$m$^{-2}$) densities, respectively. A simple means to tune the
density of well-developed nanowire ensembles between these two extremes is
generally lacking. Here, we examine the self-assembly of SiN$_x$ patches on
TiN(111) substrates which are eventually acting as seeds for the growth of GaN
nanowires. We first found that if prepared by reactive sputtering, the TiN
surface is characterized by \{100\} facets for which the GaN incubation time is
extremely long. Fast GaN nucleation is only obtained after deposition of a
sub-monolayer of SiN$_x$ atoms prior to the GaN growth. By varying the amount
of pre-deposited SiN$_x$, the GaN nanowire density could be tuned by three
orders of magnitude with excellent uniformity over the entire wafer, bridging
the density regimes conventionally attainable by direct self-assembly with MBE
or MOVPE. The analysis of the nanowire morphology agrees with a nucleation of
the GaN nanowires on nanometric SiN$_x$ patches. The photoluminescence analysis
of single freestanding GaN nanowires reveals a band edge luminescence dominated
by excitonic transitions that are broad and blue shifted compared to bulk GaN,
an effect that is related to the small nanowire diameter and to the presence of
a thick native oxide. The approach developed here can be principally used for
tuning the density of most III-V semiconductors nucleus grown on inert surfaces
like 2D materials.

<h3>Adaptive Programmable Networks for In Materia Neuromorphic Computing</h3>

Modern AI and machine-learning provide striking performance. However, this
comes with rapidly-spiralling energy costs arising from growing network size
and inefficiencies of the von Neumann architecture. `Reservoir computing'
offers an energy-efficient alternative to large networks, fixing randomised
weights for energetically-cheap training. The massively-parallel processing
underpinning machine-learning is poorly catered for by CMOS, with in materia
neuromorphic computing an attractive solution.
Nanomagnetic artificial spin-systems are ideal candidates for neuromorphic
hardware. Their passive memory, state-dependent dynamics and nonlinear GHz
spin-wave response provide powerful computation. However, any single physical
reservoir must trade-off between performance metrics including nonlinearity and
memory-capacity, with the compromise typically hard-coded during
nanofabrication. Here, we present three artificial spin-systems: square
artificial spin ice, square artificial spin-vortex ice and a disordered
pinwheel artificial spin-vortex ice. We show how tuning system geometry and
dynamics defines computing performance.
We engineer networks where each node is a high-dimensional physical
reservoir, implementing parallel, deep and multilayer physical neural network
architectures. This solves the issue of physical reservoir performance
compromise, allowing a small suite of synergistic physical systems to address
diverse tasks and provide a broad range of reprogrammable
computationally-distinct configurations. These networks outperform any single
reservoir across a broad taskset. Crucially, we move beyond reservoir computing
to present a method for reconfigurably programming inter-layer network
connections, enabling on-demand task optimised performance.

<h3>Braid Protected Topological Band Structures with Unpaired Exceptional  Points</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05788" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05788</a>
<br>
<i>J. Lukas K. König, Kang Yang, Jan Carl Budich, Emil J. Bergholtz</i>
<br>

We demonstrate the existence of topologically stable unpaired exceptional
points (EPs), and construct simple non-Hermitian (NH) tight-binding models
exemplifying such remarkable nodal phases. While Fermion doubling, i.e. the
necessity of compensating the topological charge of a stable nodal point by an
anti-dote, rules out a direct counterpart of our findings in the realm of
Hermitian semimetals, here we derive how non-commuting braids of complex energy
levels may stabilize unpaired EPs. Drawing on this insight, we reveal the
occurrence of a single, unpaired EP, manifested as a non-Abelian monopole in
the Brillouin zone of a minimal three-band model. This third-order degeneracy
cannot be fully gapped by any local perturbation. Instead, it may split into
simpler (second-order) degeneracies that can only gap out by pairwise
annihilation after having moved around inequivalent large circles of the
Brillouin zone. Our results imply the incompleteness of a topological
classification based on winding numbers, due to non-Abelian representations of
the braid group intertwining three or more complex energy levels.

<h3>Strong Quantization of Current-carrying Electron States in  $δ$-layer Systems</h3>

We present an open-system quantum-mechanical real-space study of the
conductive properties and size quantization in phosphorus $\delta$-layers
systems, interesting for their beyond-Moore and quantum computing applications.
Recently it has been demonstrated that an open-system quantum mechanical
treatment provides a much more accurate match to ARPES measurements in
highly-conductive, highly-confined systems than the traditional approaches
(i.e. periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions) and, furthermore, it allows
accurate predictions of conductive properties of such systems from the first
principles. Here we reveal that quantization effects are strong for device
widths $W<10$~nm, and we show, for the first time, that the number of
propagating modes determines not only the conductivity, but the distinctive
spatial distribution of the current-carrying electron states. For $W>10$~nm,
the quantization effects practically vanish and the conductivity tends to the
infinitely-wide device's values.

Transition metal oxides are state-of-the-art materials for catalysing the
oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose slow kinetics currently limit the
efficiency of water electrolysis. However, microscale physicochemical
heterogeneity between particles, dynamic reactions both in the bulk and at the
surface, and an interplay between particle reactivity and electrolyte makes
probing the OER challenging. Here, we overcome these limitations by applying
state-of-the-art compressive Raman imaging to uncover competing bias-dependent
mechanisms for the OER in a solid electrocatalyst, {\alpha}-Li2IrO3. By
spatially and temporally tracking changes in the in- and out-of-plane Ir-O
stretching modes - identified by density functional theory calculations - we
follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange
under a variety of electrolytes, particle compositions and cycling conditions.
We extract velocities of phase fronts and demonstrate that at low
overpotentials oxygen is evolved by the combination of an
electrochemical-chemical mechanism and a classical electrocatalytic adsorbate
mechanism, whereas at high overpotentials only the latter occurs. These results
provide strategies to promote mechanisms for enhanced OER performances, and
highlight the power of compressive Raman imaging for low-cost, chemically
specific tracking of microscale reaction dynamics in a broad range of systems
where ion and electron exchange can be coupled to structural changes, i.e.
catalysts, battery materials, memristors, etc.

Nanobeam electron diffraction can probe local structural properties of
complex crystalline materials including phase, orientation, tilt, strain, and
polarization. Ideally, each diffraction pattern from a projected area of a few
unit cells would produce clear a Bragg diffraction pattern, where the
reciprocal lattice vectors can be measured from the spacing of the diffracted
spots, and the spot intensities are equal to the square of the structure factor
amplitudes. However, many samples are too thick for this simple interpretation
of their diffraction patterns, as multiple scattering of the electron beam can
produce a highly nonlinear relationship between the spot intensities and the
underlying structure. Here, we develop a stacked Bloch wave method to model the
diffracted intensities from thick samples with structure that varies along the
electron beam. Our method reduces the large parameter space of electron
scattering to just a few structural variables per probe position, making it
fast enough to apply to very large fields of view. We apply our method to
SrTiO$_3$/PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ multilayer samples, and successfully disentangle
specimen tilt from the mean polarization of the PbTiO$_3$ layers. We elucidate
the structure of complex vortex topologies in the PbTiO$_3$ layers,
demonstrating the promise of our method to extract material properties from
thick samples.

<h3>First and Second Laws of Information Processing by Nonequilibrium  Dynamical States</h3>

The averaged steady-state surprisal links a driven stochastic system's
information processing to its nonequilibrium thermodynamic response. By
explicitly accounting for the effects of nonequilibrium steady states, a
decomposition of the surprisal results in an information processing First Law
that extends and tightens -- to strict equalities -- various information
processing Second Laws. Applying stochastic thermodynamics' integral
fluctuation theorems then shows that the decomposition reduces to the second
laws under appropriate limits. In unifying them, the First Law paves the way to
identifying the mechanisms by which nonequilibrium steady-state systems extract
work from information-bearing degrees of freedom. To illustrate, we analyze an
autonomous Maxwellian information ratchet that tunably violates detailed
balance in its effective dynamics. This demonstrates how the presence of
nonequilibrium steady states qualitatively alters an information engine's
allowed functionality.

<h3>Buckling of lipidic ultrasound contrast agents under quasi-static load</h3>

<br>
Collapse of lipidic ultrasound contrast agents under high-frequency
compressive load has been historically interpreted by the vanishing of surface
tension. By contrast, buckling of elastic shells is known to occur when costly
compressible stress is released through bending. Through quasi-static
compression experiments on lipidic shells, we analyze the buckling events in
the framework of classical elastic buckling theory and deduce the mechanical
characteristics of these shells. They are then compared to that obtained
through acoustic characterization.

<h3>3D two-electron double quantum dot: comparison between the behavior of  some physical quantities under two different confinement potentials in the  presence of a magnetic field</h3>

We have considered a system consisting of two coupled quantum dots containing
two electrons, i.e., two quantum dots next to each other with one excess
electron each, subjected to an uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the
quantum dots plane. The effect of different confinement potential profiles
under which the electrons are subjected is studied. This study has been
performed in the light of interest in fundamental logical quantum-gate
operations: we have been concerned in analysing the behaviour of the main
physical quantities which should be involved in a two-qubit quantum-gate
operation for two different profiles of confinement found in literature. Our
purpose was to establish how sensitive the physical quantities are to the
confinement profile and in which range of magnetic field this issue can be
critical.

<h3>Dynamics of ethylene groups and hyperfine interactions between donor and  anion molecules in $λ$-type organic conductors studied by  $^{69,71}$Ga-NMR spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05877</a>

We present the results of $^{69,71}$Ga-NMR measurements on an organic
antiferromagnet $\lambda$-(BEDSe-TTF)$_2$GaCl$_4$
[BEDSe-TTF=bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene], with comparison to reports
on $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ [BETS=bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene]
[T. Kobayashi et al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 235131 (2020)]. We found that the
dynamics of two crystallographically independent ethylene groups induce two
types of quadrupolar relaxation in the high-temperature region. As the ethylene
motion freezes, hyperfine (HF) interactions develop between $\pi$ spin and Ga
nuclear spin below 100 K, and thereby magnetic fluctuations of the $\pi$-spin
system are detected even from the Ga site. The HF interaction in
$\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ was more than twice as large as in
$\lambda$-(BEDSe-TTF)$_2$GaCl$_4$, implying that the short contacts between Cl
atoms and the chalcogens of fulvalene part are essential for the transferred HF
interaction. We propose that NMR using nuclei in anion layers is useful for
studying interlayer interactions in organic conductors, which have not been
studied experimentally. In addition, because the mechanism of the transferred
HF interaction is considered to be the same as $\pi$-$d$ interaction in
isostructural Fe-containing $\lambda$-type salts, our findings aid in the
understanding of their physical properties.

<h3>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation from involutions</h3>

The Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR) is a lower bound for the
variance of a current as a function of the average entropy production and
average current. Depending on the assumptions, one obtains different versions
of the TUR. For instance, from the exchange fluctuation theorem, one obtains a
corresponding exchange TUR. Alternatively, we show that TURs are a consequence
of a very simple property: every process $s$ has only one inverse $s'=m(s)$,
where $m$ is an involution, $m(m(s))=s$. This property allows the derivation of
a general TUR without using any fluctuation theorem. As applications, we obtain
the exchange TUR, the asymmetric TUR, a fluctuation-response inequality and
lower bounds for the entropy production in terms of other nonequilibrium
metrics.

<h3>The anisotropic grain size effect on the mechanical response of  polycrystals: The role of columnar grain morphology in additively  manufactured metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05879</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Additively manufactured (AM) metals exhibit highly complex microstructures,
particularly with respect to grain morphology, which typically contains
heterogenous grain size distribution, anomalous and anisotropic grain shapes,
and the so-called columnar grains. In general, the conventional morphological
descriptors are not suitable to represent the complex and anisotropic grain
morphology of AM microstructures. In this paper, we formally introduce the
notions of axial grain size and grain size anisotropy as robust morphological
descriptors, which can adequately represent highly complex grain morphologies.
We instantiated a discrete sample of polycrystalline aggregate as a
representative volume element, which has random crystallographic orientation
and misorientation distributions. However, the instantiated volume element
contains the typical morphological features of AM microstructures including
distinctive grain size heterogeneity and anisotropic grain size owing to its
pronounced columnar grain morphology. We ensured that any anisotropy that
arises in the macroscopic mechanical response of the instantiated sample is
mainly associated with its underlying anisotropic grain size. The
representative volume element was then used for meso-scale full-field crystal
plasticity simulations corresponding to uniaxial deformation along different
axes via a spectral solver and a physics-based crystal plasticity constitutive
model. Through the numerical analysis, we were able to isolate the contribution
of anisotropic grain size to the anisotropy in the mechanical response of
polycrystalline aggregates, particularly those with the characteristic complex
grain morphology of AM metals. Such a contribution can be compactly described
by an exponential decay relationship.

<h3>Static and dynamic magnetic properties of the spin-5/2 triangle lattice  antiferromagnet Na3Fe(PO4)2 studied by 31P NMR</h3>

$^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements have been carried out
to investigate the magnetic properties and spin dynamics of Fe$^{3+}$ ($S$ =
5/2) spins in the two-dimensional triangular lattice (TL) compound
Na$_3$Fe(PO$_4$)$_2$. The temperature ($T$) dependence of nuclear spin-lattice
relaxation rates ($1/T_1$) shows a clear peak around N\'eel temperature,
$T_{\rm N} = 10.9$~K, corresponding to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition.
From the temparature dependence of NMR shift ($K$) above $T_{\rm N}$, an
exchange coupling between Fe$^{3+}$ spins was estimated to be $J/k_{\rm
B}\simeq 1.9$~K using the spin-5/2 Heisenberg isotropic-TL model. The
temperature dependence of $1/T_1T$ divided by the magnetic susceptibility
($\chi$), $1/T_1T\chi$, above $T_{\rm N}$ proves the AFM nature of spin
fluctuations below $\sim$ 50 K in the paramagnetic state. In the magnetically
ordered state below $T_{\rm N}$, the characteristic rectangular shape of the
NMR spectra is observed, indicative of a commensurate AFM state in its ground
state. The strong temperature dependence of 1/$T_1$ in the AFM state is well
explained by the two-magnon (Raman) process of the spin waves in a 3D
antiferromagnet with a spin-anisotropy energy gap of 5.7 K. The temperature
dependence of sublattice magnetization is also well reproduced by the spin
waves. Those results indicate that the magnetically ordered state of
Na$_3$Fe(PO$_4$)$_2$ is a conventional 3D AFM state, and no obvious spin
frustration effects were detected in its ground state.

<h3>Negative GMR Effect in current perpendicular-to-plane (Zn,Cr)Te/Cu/Co  spin salves</h3>

Magnetic and transport properties are explored in the current
perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) spin salves with Cr doped wide band gap
semiconductor ZnTe as one of the ferromagnetic electrodes. A negative
magnetoresistance is observed in these CPP spin valves at low temperature, with
a strong temperature dependence. This effect can be explained by the large
difference of spin scattering asymmetry coefficients in (Zn,Cr)Te and Cobalt,
due to the very different spin polarizations of the two materials as revealed
by the DFT calculation.

the otherwise weakly correlated host medium. Here, the environment is
dynamically downfolded on the correlated subspace. It is captured via
renormalization of one and two quasiparticle interaction terms which are
evaluated using many-body perturbation theory. We outline the strategy on how
to take the dynamical effects into account by going beyond the static limit
approximation. Further, we introduce an efficient stochastic implementation
that enables treating the host environment with a large number of electrons at
a minimal computational cost. For small explicitly correlated subspace, the
dynamical effects are critical. We demonstrate the methodology by reproducing
optical excitations in the negatively charged NV center defect in diamond, that
are in excellent agreement with experimental results.

Color centers in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies.
Most color centers in diamond discovered thus far emit in the visible or
near-infrared wavelength range, which are incompatible with long-distance fiber
communication and unfavorable for imaging in biological tissues. Here, we
report the experimental observation of a new color center that emits in the
telecom O-band, which we observe in silicon-doped bulk single crystal diamonds
and microdiamonds. Combining absorption and photoluminescence measurements, we
identify a zero-phonon line at 1221 nm and phonon replicas separated by 42 meV.
Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we measure an excited state lifetime
of around 270 ps and observe a long-lived baseline that may arise from
intersystem crossing to another spin manifold.

<h3>Electric-field tuned valley polarization in valleytronic bilayers with  ferrovalley metal and valley gapless semiconductor</h3>

The interaction between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and A-type
antiferromagnetism can induce layer-polarized anomalous valley Hall (LP-AVH)
effect in valleytronic bilayer systems, which may have potential application in
spintronics and valleytronics.Here, it is proposed that the valley splitting
enhancement and valley polarization reversal can be achieved by electric field.
Taking the bilayer $\mathrm{RuBr_2}$ as an example, our proposal is confirmed
by the first-principle calculations. With appropriate electric field range,
increasing electric field can enhance valley splitting, and the valley
polarization can be reversed by flipping electric field direction. Besides, a
possible electronic state ferrovalley metal (FVM) is proposed, where the K and
-K valleys are both metallic and electron and hole carriers simultaneously
exist. In the extreme case, the FVM can become valley gapless semiconductor
(VGS) by analogizing spin gapless semiconductor (SGS). The FVM and VGS can be
achieved in bilayer $\mathrm{RuBr_2}$ by applying electric field. To
effectively tune valley properties by electric field in bilayer systems, the
parent monolayer should possess out-of-plane magnetization, and have large
valley splitting. Our results shed light on the possible role of electric field
in tuning valleytronic bilayer systems, and provide a way to design the
ferrovalley-related material by electric field.

<h3>Theory of Intrinsic In-Plane Hall Effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Hui Wang, Yue-Xin Huang, Huiying Liu, Xiaolong Feng, Jiaojiao Zhu, Weikang Wu, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments reported an in-plane Hall effect (IPHE), where the Hall
current is odd in the in-plane magnetic field and scales linearly with both
electric and magnetic fields applied. Existing theories rely exclusively on a
spin origin, which requires spin-orbit coupling to take effect. Here, we
develop a general theory for the intrinsic IPHE, highlighting a previously
unknown orbital mechanism and connecting it to a band geometric quantity -- the
anomalous orbital polarizability (AOP). Importantly, the orbital mechanism does
not request spin-orbit coupling, so sizable IPHE can occur and is dominated by
the orbital contribution in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Combined
with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate our theory with quantitative
evaluation of the effect in bulk materials $\mathrm{TaSb_{2}}$,
$\mathrm{NbAs_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{SrAs_{3}}$. We further show that AOP and its
associated orbital IPHE can be greatly enhanced at topological band crossings,
offering a new way to probe topological materials.

<h3>Reverse Doping Asymmetry in Semiconductor Thin Films Using External  Voltage</h3>

<br>
<i>Kai Liu, Zhibin Yi, Guangfu Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
Doping asymmetry is a notable phenomenon with semiconductors and a
particularly longstanding challenge limiting the applications of most
wide-band-gap semiconductors, which are inherent of spontaneous heavy n- or
p-type doping because of their extreme band edges. This study theoretically
shows that by applying a proper external voltage on materials during their
growth or doping processes, we can largely tune the band edges and consequently
reverse the doping asymmetry in semiconductor thin films. We take zinc oxide as
a touchstone and computationally demonstrate that this voltage-assisted-doping
approach efficiently suppresses the spontaneous n-type defects by around four
orders under three distinct growth conditions and successfully generates p-type
zinc oxide up to the lowest acceptor levels. The proposed approach is
insensitive to materials, growth conditions, or defects origins, and thus
offers a general solution to the doping asymmetry in semiconductor thin films.

<br>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is ideally suited to provide
direct, reciprocal-space information of long-wavelength magnetic modulations,
such as helicoids, solitons, merons, or skyrmions. SANS of such structures in
thin films or micro-structured bulk materials is strongly limited by the tiny
scattering volume vis a vis the prohibitively large background scattering by
the substrate and support structures. Considering near-surface scattering
closely above the critical angle of reflection, where unwanted signal
contributions due to substrate or support structures becomes very small, we
establish equivalent scattering patterns of the helical, conical, skyrmion
lattice, and fluctuation-disordered phases in a polished bulk sample of MnSi
between conventional transmission and near-surface SANS geometries. This
motivates the prediction of a complete repository of scattering patterns
expected for thin films in the near-surface SANS geometry for each orientation
of the magnetic order with respect to the scattering plane.

We have presented the synthesis, structural, and magnetic properties from the
experimental point of view. Then we verified our experimental observation by
studying the electronic and magnetic properties of Al-doped LaMnO3 from the
first principle density functional theory (DFT) and Monte-Carlo simulation. We
have synthesized the LaAlxMn1-xO3 (x= 0.05, 0.15, 0.25) and performed the
Rietveld refinement of XRD data to determine the lattice parameters. To see the
mixed valance of Mn-ion, we performed the XPS of 25% Al-doped material. The
magnetic study shows the ferromagnetic transition of these materials. Using XRD
refinement values, we have completed the DFT calculations. The Monte Carlo
simulation has been done through the anisotropic Ising model to analyze the
origin of magnetic transition. We have determined the anisotropy and the
interaction constants from the DFT calculations.

<br>
<br>
Owing to the increasing interest in the commercialization of phase-change
memory (PCM) devices, a number of TCAD models have been developed for their
simulation. These models formulate the melting, amorphization and
crystallization of phase-change materials as well as their extreme conductivity
dependence on both electric field and temperature into a set of
self-consistently-solved thermoelectric and phase-field partial-differential
equations. However, demonstrations of the ability of such models to match
actual experimental results are rare. In addition, such PCM devices also
require a so-called selector device - such as an Ovonic Threshold Switching
(OTS) device - in series for proper memory operation. However, monolithic
simulation of both the PCM and OTS selector device in a single simulation is
largely absent from the literature, despite its potential value for material-
and design-space explorations. It is the goal of this work to first
characterize a PCM device in isolation against experimental data, then to
demonstrate the qualitative behavior of a simulated OTS device in isolation and
finally to perform a single monolithic simulation of the PCM + OTS device
within the confines of a commercially available TCAD solver: GTS Framework.

<br>
The understanding of friction at nano-scales, ruled by the regular
arrangement of atoms, is surprisingly incomplete. Here we provide a unified
understanding by studying the interlocking potential energy of two infinite
contacting surfaces with arbitrary lattice symmetries, and extending it to
finite contacts. We categorize, based purely on geometrical features, all
possible contacts into three different types: a structurally lubric contact
where the monolayer can move isotropically without friction, a corrugated and
strongly interlocked contact, and a newly discovered directionally structurally
lubric contact where the layer can move frictionlessly along one specific
direction and retains finite friction along all other directions. This novel
category is energetically stable against rotational perturbations and provides
extreme friction anisotropy. The finite-size analysis shows that our
categorization applies to a wide range of technologically relevant materials in
contact, from adsorbates on crystal surfaces to layered two-dimensional
materials and colloidal monolayers.

<br>
<i>Churen Gui, Jun Chen, Shuai Dong</i>
<br>
<br>
Multiferroics with coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism have been
pursued for decades. However, their magnetoelectric performances remain limited
due to the common trade-off between ferroelectricity and magnetism. Here, a
family of nitride perovskites is proposed as multiferroics with prominent
physical properties and nontrivial mechanisms. Taking GdWN$_3$ as a prototype,
our first-principles calculations found that its perovskite phases own large
polarizations (e.g. $111.3$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$ for the $R3c$ phase) and a magnetic
moment $7$ $\mu_{\rm B}$/Gd$^{3+}$. More interestingly, its ferroelectric
origin is multiple, with significant contributions from both Gd$^{3+}$ and
W$^{6+}$ ions, different from its sister member LaWN$_3$ in which the
ferroelectricity almost arises from W$^{6+}$ ions only. With decreasing size of
rare earth ions, the A site ions would contribute more and more to the
ferroelectric instability. Considering that small rare earth ions can be
primary origins of both proper ferroelectricity and magnetism in nitride
perovskites, our work provides a route to pursuit more multiferroics with
unconventional mechanisms and optimal performances.

In three out of five cases considered in our work, DFT calculations presented
by Xu and Hou in their Comment give the same ground state confirmations. On the
other hand, depending on the choice of the exchange-correlation functional, the
geometry optimization within DFT results in different ground state
confirmations for B@C60 and B60, Table I of the Comment. Therefore, the energy
balance between nearest confirmations in these molecular complexes is subtle,
and various methods can give different ground state structures. Consequently,
the results of our method - the Hartree-Fock (HF) approach with the second
order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) - should be compared with the
DFT results on equal ground, we cannot agree that the DFT method used in the
Comment is superior to HF-MP2. In the Reply, we also present additional HF
calculations with the 6-31G* basis set (used in the Comment for the geometry
optimization) to show that the polarization functions do not change the ground
state confirmations obtained by us earlier at the HF/6-31G level.

The electronic structure of the toroid D$_{6h}$-Au$_{42}$ is studied within
the framework of the Hubbard Hamiltonian in the approximation of static
fluctuations. An expression for the Fourier transform of the Green's function,
the poles of which determine the energy spectrum of the nanocluster under
consideration, is obtained. The energy spectrum of the D$_{6h}$-Au$_{42}$
toroid indicates that the nanosystem is in a metallic state. Graphical
representations of the equation for the chemical potential and the density of

eV, 1.39 eV, are in the near infrared region. The energy of the ground state is
calculated for the electrically neutral as well as for the positively and
negatively charged ions of the toroid. The possibility of using of the
investigated toroid from Au atoms for the diagnostics and treatment of cancer
is shown.

Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) is a promising oxide solid electrolyte for
all-solid-state batteries due to its excellent air stability, wide
electrochemical stability window and cost-effective precursor materials.
However, further improvement in their ionic conductivity performance is
hindered by the presence of inter-grain phases leading to a major obstacle to
the advanced design of oxide based solid-state electrolytes. This study
establishes and quantifies the influence of inter-grain phases, their 3D
morphology, and formed compositions on the overall ion conductivity properties
of LAGP pellets fabricated under different Spark plasma sintering conditions.
Based on complementary techniques, such as PEIS, XRD, 3D FIB-SEM tomography and
solid-state MAS NMR coupled with DFT modelling, a deep insight into the
inter-grain phase microstructures is obtained revealing that the inter-grain
region is comprised of Li4P2O7 and a disordered Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 phase. We
demonstrate that optimal ionic conductivity for the LAGP system is achieved for
the 680 {\deg}C SPS preparation when the disordered Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 phase
dominates the inter-grain region composition with reduced contributions from
the highly ordered Li4P2O7 phases.

The Integral Fluctuation Theorem for entropy production (IFT) is among the
few equalities that are known to be valid for physical systems arbitrarily
driven far from equilibrium. Microscopically, it can be understood as an
inherent symmetry for the fluctuating entropy production rate implying the
second law of thermodynamics. Here, we examine an IFT statistical estimator
based on regular sampling and discuss its limitations for nonequilibrium
systems, when sampling rare events becomes pivotal. Furthermore, via a large
deviation study, we discuss a method to carefully setup an experiment in the
parameter region where the IFT estimator safely converges and also show how to
improve the convergence region for Markov chains with finite correlation
length. We corroborate our arguments with two illustrative examples.

Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles of great interest for data
storage applications because of their small size, high stability, and ease of
manipulation via electric current. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions, with new
features and huge benefits (ultra-small skyrmion sizes, no transverse
deflection and efficient manipulation), have recently become the subject of
intense focus. Here we show that a spontaneous antiferromagnetic
skyrmion/antiskyrmion lattice (AF-SkL/ASkL) emerges in the classical Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on the triangular-lattice under magnetic fields, taking only
exchange interactions up to third nearest neighbors ($J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$). By
means of the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large scale Monte-Carlo
simulations (combining Parallel-Tempering and overrelaxation with the
Metropolis algorithm), we present a rich $J_2$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram
including exotic multiple-q phases, degenerate states and a spontaneous
AF-SkL/ASkL lattice at intermediate magnetic fields. In addition, we show that
at zero magnetic field, exotic spin liquid states with ring-like degeneracy
emerge at intermediate temperatures, which are broken by thermal fluctuations
selecting different multiple-q states. These findings greatly enrich the
research on antiferromagnetic skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials or
lattices including relatively weak Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

<br>
<br>
The activation and dissociation of H2 molecules on Cu(001) surface is studied
theoretically. The activation barrier for the dissociation of H2 on Cu(001) is
determined by first-principles calculations to be ~ 0.59 eV in height. Electron
transfer from the substrate Cu to H2 plays a key role in the activation,
breaking of the H-H bond and the formation of the Cu-H bonds. The competition
of H-H and Cu-H bonds may be described by the overlap of the wave functions of
the outermost valence electrons. Using the transfer matrix method, we are able
to study the role of quantum tunneling in the dissociation process, which is
found to be significant at room temperature and below. At given temperatures,
the tunneling contributions from the translational and vibrational motions of
H2 are quantified for the dissociation process. Within a wide range of
temperatures, the effects of quantum tunneling on the effective barriers of
dissociation and the rate constants are revealed. The deduced energetic
parameters associated with thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium (molecular
beam) conditions are comparable with experimental data. In the low-temperature
region, crossover from classical to quantum regime is identified.

Vector and vortex laser beams are desired in many applications and are
usually created by manipulating the laser output or by inserting optical
components in the laser cavity. Distinctly, inserting liquid crystals into the
laser cavity allows for extensive control over the emitted light due to their
high susceptibility to external fields and birefringent nature. In this work we
demonstrate diverse optical modes for lasing as enabled and stablised by
topological birefringent soft matter structures using numerical modelling. We
show diverse structuring of light -- with different 3D intensity and
polarization profiles -- as realised by topological soft matter structures in
radial nematic droplet, in 2D nematic cavities of different geometry and
including topological defects with different charges and winding numbers, in
arbitrary varying birefringence fields with topological defects and in
pixelated birefringent profiles. We use custom written FDFD code to calculate
emergent electromagnetic eigenmodes. Control over lasing is of a particular
interest aiming towards the creation of general intensity, polarization and
topologically shaped laser beams.

Spin-valve effect has been the focus of spintronics over the last decades due
to its potential in many spintronic devices. Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals
(vdW) materials are highly expected to build the spin-valve heterojunction.
However, the Curie temperatures (TC) of the vdW ferromagnetic 2D crystals are
mostly below room temperature (~30-220 K). It is very challenging to develop
room temperature, ferromagnetic (FM) 2D crystals based spin-valve devices which
are still not available to date. We report the first room temperature, FM 2D
crystal based all-2D vdW Fe3GaTe2/MoS2/Fe3GaTe2 spin valve devices. The
Magnetoresistance (MR) of the all- devices is up to 15.89% at 2.3 K and 11.97%
at 10 K, 4-30 times of MR from the spin valves of
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/MoS$_2$/Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and conventional NiFe/MoS$_2$/NiFe.
Typical spin valve effect shows strong dependence on MoS2 spacer thickness in
the vdW heterojunction. Importantly, the spin valve effect (0.31%) still
robustly exists at 300 K with low working currents down to 10 nA (0.13
A/cm$^2$). The results provide a general vdW platform to room temperature, 2D

Shaping and steering of light beams is essential in many modern applications,
ranging from optical tweezers, camera lenses, vision correction to 3D displays.
However, current realisations require increasingly greater tunability and aim
for lesser specificity for use in diverse applications. Here, we demonstrate
tunable light beam control based on multi-layer liquid-crystal cells and
external electric field, capable of extended beam shifting, steering, and
expanding, using a combination of theory and full numerical modelling, both for
liquid crystal orientations and the transmitted light. Specifically, by
exploiting three different function-specific and tunable birefringent nematic
layers, we show an effective liquid-crystal beam control device, capable of
precise control of outgoing light propagation, with possible application in
projectors or automotive headlamps.

We present results of high magnetic field experiments in pure $^3$He (in the
absence of $^4$He coverage) in nematic aerogel. In this case the aerogel
strands are covered with few atomic layers of solid paramagnetic $^3$He, which
enables the spin-exchange mechanism for $^3$He quasiparticles scattering. Our
earlier NMR experiments showed that in low fields, instead of the polar phase,
the A phase is expected to emerge in nematic aerogel. We use a vibrating wire
resonator with the sample of aerogel attached to it and measure temperature
dependencies of resonance properties of the resonator at different magnetic
fields. A superfluid transition temperature of $^3$He in aerogel, obtained from
the experiments, increases nonlinearly in applied magnetic field. And this
increase is suppressed compared with that for bulk A$_1$ phase, which we
attribute to an influence of the magnetic scattering channel, previously
considered theoretically for the case of $^3$He confined in isotropic silica
aerogel. However, we observe the essential quantitative mismatch with
theoretical expectations.

Breaking down the traditional perception on phonons which are achiral, the
recent discovery of chiral phonon carrying angular momentum provides possible
ways to couple electron, photon, spin, magnon and exciton, etc. We
theoretically proposed an electron-chiral phonon interaction with two-phonon
process, in contrast to conventional electron-phonon interaction, and a kind of
effective Hubbard U through exchanging two chiral phonons is proposed. Taking
two-dimensional diatomic honeycomb lattice as an example, we found this
repulsive Hubbard U mediated by chiral phonons induces unconventional and
high-temperature superconductivity. Moreover, the numerical calculations show
an inverse isotope effect which is consistent with experimental observations in
high-$T_c$ superconductors. Our finding on electron-chiral phonon and the
associated Cooper pair provides a path to understand the high-$T_c$
superconductivity.

<br>
To control the properties of as-solidified components, it is essential to
link the technological parameters and structures accurately enough, requiring a
deep understanding of solidification dynamics. The existing theoretical
insights mostly focus on one single dendrite tip, ignoring the interfacial
effects of the neighboring ones and the continuity of evolution. Since
solidification patterns are dissipative structures formed out of equilibrium in
an open system, the investigation during the entire process and the insights
from dissipation could give a deeper understanding of solidification dynamics.
In this paper, through the quantitative phase-field model, the dynamic
evolution of directional solidification is investigated. Firstly, the evolution
of the characteristic parameters with time is discussed in detail,
demonstrating the dissipative features of solidification. Secondly, by
adjusting the solute diffusion coefficient DL, the dissipation due to an
undercooling of the interface can be altered. With different DL, the dynamic
evolution in the directional solidification is discussed, including the planar
growth and instability, the dendrite growth, and the steady-state growth. The
role of solute diffusion in solidification evolution from the viewpoint of
dissipation is given out. The investigations illustrate the dynamic evolution
of interfaces does not has unique relationships with the characteristic
parameters, such as VI, c0, \r{ho}, and Rtip, etc. Because solidification
patterns are dissipative structures formed out of equilibrium. The degree of
dissipation and non-equilibrium of the system plays an important role during
the evolution, which should be considered in the study.

Over the past decade or two, the concept has emerged of using multiple types
of weak interactions simultaneously to enhance the mechanical properties of
elastomers. These weak interactions include physical entanglements, hydrogen
bonds, metal-coordination bonds, dynamic covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. The
combination of entanglements and ionic bonding has been minimally explored and
is particularly exciting because of the broad application space for
polyelectrolytes. In this work, a constitutive model framework is developed to
describe the response of elastomers with both ionic bonds and entanglements. We
formulate a micromechanical model that couples together chain stretching, ionic
bond slipping, and entanglement evolution. The ionic bonds provide toughness by
enabling plastic deformation in comparison to covalently crosslinked material
and add strength compared to a linear polymer. Evolution of the entanglement
density is taken as a key mechanism that can govern stiffness, toughness, and
self-recovery in elastomers. The model is used to match bulk polyelectrolytes
with different fractions of ionic components under a variety of loading
histories. The variations in material parameters are then used to help
understand the relative importance of different governing mechanisms in the
bulk polymers. We show that the theoretical framework can explain our
experimental uniaxial tensile experimental results for polyelectrolytes. This
model can help to design better material with high stiffness and toughness. We
expect that our model can be extended to explain the mechanical behavior of
other polyelectrolytes and other soft materials with a wide range of dynamic
bonds.

The discovery of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in 1980 marked a turning point
in condensed matter physics: given appropriate experimental conditions, the
Hall conductivity {\sigma}_xy of a two-dimensional (2D) electron system is
exactly quantized. But what happens to the QHE in three dimensions (3D)?
Experiments over the past 40 years showed that some of the remarkable physics
of the QHE, in particular plateau-like Hall conductivities {\sigma}_xy
accompanied by minima in the longitudinal resistivity \r{ho}_xx, can also be
found in 3D materials. However, since typically \r{ho}_xx remains finite and a
quantitative relation between {\sigma}_xy and the conductance quantum e^2/h
could not be established, the role of quantum Hall physics in 3D remains
unsettled. Following a recent series of exciting experiments, the QHE in 3D has
now returned to the centre stage. Here, we summarize the leap in understanding
of 3D matter in magnetic fields emerging from these experiments.

<h3>Aberration of the Green's function estimator in hybridization expansion  continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo</h3>

We describe an aberration of the resampling estimator for the Green's
function customarily used in hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum
Monte Carlo. It occurs due to Pauli principle constraints in calculations of
Anderson impurity models with baths consisting of a discrete energy spectrum.
We identify the missing Feynman diagrams, characterize the affected models and
discuss implications as well as solutions. This issue does not occur when using
worm sampling or in the presence of continuous baths. However certain energy
spectra can be inherently close to a discrete limit, and we explain why
autocorrelation times can become very large in these cases.

We detail here some matters arising from the recent paper by Qian et. al.,
Nature 606, pages 902-908 (2022). We demonstrate, based on data supplied by
Qian et. al., and corroborated by theoretical modeling, that one of the central
conclusions of the manuscript - namely the behavior of the chirality-induced
spin-selectivity (CISS) effect at low temperatures - can actually be
consistently interpreted in a different way, which is in fact opposite to the
interpretation proposed by Qian et. al.

<h3>Micromechanical Experimental-Numerical Study Reveals Martensite  Plasticity and Damage Competition in Dual-Phase Steel</h3>

Martensite damage in Dual-Phase (DP) steel has been studied extensively, yet,
the exact deformation mechanisms that trigger or inhibit damage initiation
remain mostly unexplored. Whereas generally assumed to be hard and brittle,
lath martensite in fact deforms in a highly anisotropic manner, showing large
strains under favorable habit plane orientations, which is attributed both to
the lath morphology and so-called 'substructure boundary sliding'. Yet, the
correlation (or interplay) between plasticity and damage in lath martensite has
not received much attention. Therefore, we raise the question whether these
soft martensite plasticity mechanisms can delay or even inhibit damage
initiation. We analyze several thin 'damage-sensitive' martensite notches by
combining several state-of-the-art experimental and analysis methods.
Deformations are tracked in-situ at the nanoscale, aligned to detailed
microstructure maps, and categorised, for each martensite variant, into habit
plane or out-of-habit plane slip. In these experiments, strong plasticity
(>70%) is observed in martensite notches, enabled by slip along a favorably
oriented habit plane, whereas damaged notches have unfavorably oriented habit
planes, showing limited pre-damage strains (<10%), carried by
out-of-habit-plane slip. Additionally, one-to-one experimentally based Crystal
Plasticity (CP) simulations are performed in parallel, employing a recently
introduced enriched CP approach which models a soft plasticity mechanism on the
variants' habit plane. The Enriched CP simulations show considerably lower
hydrostatic stresses in non-damaged and plastically deforming notches, thereby
revealing that the soft habit plane mechanism is key for introducing the high
plastic anisotropy that can lead to the inhibition of martensite damage in
highly strained martensite notches.

In bulk and low-dimensional extended systems, the screening of excitations by
the electron cloud is a key feature governing spectroscopic properties. Widely
used computational approaches, especially in the framework of many-body
perturbation theory, such as the GW approximation and the resulting approximate
Bethe-Salpeter equation, are explicitly formulated in terms of the screened
Coulomb interaction. In the present work we explore the effect of screening in
absorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy, concentrating on the effect
of local distortions on the screening and elucidating the resulting changes in
the various spectra. Using the layered bulk oxide V$_2$O$_5$ as prototype
material, we show in which way local distortions affect the screening, and in
which way changes in the screening impact electron energy loss and absorption
spectra including excitons. We highlight cancellations that make many-body
effects in the spectra very robust with respect to structural modifications,
while the band structure undergoes significant changes and the nature of the
excitations may also be affected. This yields insight concerning the
structure-properties relations that are crucial for the use of V$_2$O$_5$ as
energy storage material, and more generally, that may be used to optimize the
analysis and the calculation of electronic spectra in complex materials.

<h3>Transport in p-wave interacting Fermi gases</h3>

The scattering properties of spin-polarized Fermi gases are dominated by
p-wave interactions. Besides their inherent angular dependence, these
interactions differ from their s-wave counterparts as they also require the
presence of a finite effective range in order to understand the low-energy
properties of the system. In this article we examine how the shear viscosity
and thermal conductivity of a three-dimensional spin-polarized Fermi gas in the
normal phase depend on the effective range and the scattering volume in both
the weakly and strongly interacting limits. We show that although the shear
viscosity and thermal conductivity both explicitly depend on the effective
range near resonance, the Prandtl number which parametrizes the ratio of
momentum to thermal diffusivity does not have an explicit interaction
dependence both at resonance and for weak interactions in the low-energy limit.
In contrast to s-wave systems, p-wave scattering exhibits an additional
resonance at weak attraction from a quasi-bound state at positive energies,
which leads to a pronounced dip in the shear viscosity at specific
temperatures.

<h3>Solving a problem with a single parameter: A smooth \textit{bcc} to  \textit{fcc} phase transition for metallic lithium</h3>

Density functional calculations for metallic lithium along a cuboidal
\textit{bcc}-to-\textit{fcc} transformation path demonstrate that the
\textit{bcc} phase is quasi-degenerate with the \textit{fcc} phase with a very
small activiation barrier of 0.1~kJ/mol, but becomes the dominant phase at
higher temperatures in accordance with Landau theory. This resolves the
long-standing controversy about the two phases for lithium.

<h3>High-$T_c$ Superconductivity and Finite-Temperature Phase Diagram of the  $t$-$t'$-$J$ Model</h3>

The robust $d$-wave superconductive (SC) ground state was recently identified
in the square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model with both the nearest-neighbor ($t$)
and next-nearest-neighbor ($t'$) hoppings. However, its finite-temperature
phase diagram remains elusive. It is therefore highly motivated to explore the
proposed $d$-wave SC phase and possible unusual normal states at elevated
temperatures. Here we exploit state-of-the-art thermal tensor network approach
with implemented U(1)$_\textrm{charge} \times$ SU(2)$_\textrm{spin}$ symmetry
to accurately simulate the finite-temperature properties of this $t$-$t'$-$J$
model on cylindrical lattices. Below a temperature scale of $T_c^*$, we find
prominent SC fluctuations intertwined with charge order, where the $d$-wave
pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_\textrm{SC} \sim 1/T^\alpha$ (with
$\alpha\simeq 1$). Above $T_c^*$ yet below a much higher crossover temperature
$T^*$, the magnetic susceptibility is suppressed, resembling the pseudogap
behavior observed in the underdoped cuprate superconductors. Remarkably, the SC
onset temperature $T_c^*$ is found firstly enhanced and then decreased as the
hole doping increases, which gives rise to a dome-like structure that reaches
the highest value of $T_c^* \simeq 0.05~t$ near the optimal doping, implying a
high-temperature SC in the 2D limit.

We study the dynamics of a monitored single particle in a one-dimensional,
Anderson-localized system. The time evolution is governed by Hamiltonian
dynamics for fixed time intervals, interrupted by local, projective
measurements. The competition between disorder-induced localization and
measurement-induced jumps leads to interesting behaviour of readout-averaged
quantities. We find that measurements at random positions delocalize the
average position, similar to a classical random walk. Along each quantum
trajectory, the particle remains localized, however with a modified
localization length. In contrast to measurement-induced delocalization,
controlled measurements can be used to introduce transport in the system and
localize the particle at a chosen site. In this sense, the measurements provide
a controlled environment for the particle.
