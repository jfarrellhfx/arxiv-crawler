<h3>Hyperuniform Phase-separated DNA Droplets</h3>

Many recent studies of liquid-liquid phase separation in biology focus on
phase separation as a dynamic control mechanism for cellular function, but it
can also result in complex mesoscopic structures. We investigate a model system
consisting of DNA nanostars: finite-valence, self-assembled particles that form
micron-scale liquid droplets via a binodal phase transition. We demonstrate
that, upon phase separation, nanostar droplets spontaneously form hyperuniform
structures, a type of disordered material organization that combines the
long-range order of crystals with the short-range isotropy of liquids. The
hyperuniformity of the DNA droplets is modulated by the interplay of phase
separation dynamics and droplet Brownian motion. We engineer a two-species
system of immiscible DNA droplets and find two distinctly hyperuniform
structures in the same sample, but with random cross-species droplet
correlations. This rules out explanations that rely on droplet-droplet
hydrodynamic interactions. The hyperuniformity exhibited by DNA droplets
provides insight into the interaction of dynamics and structures in varied
phase-separating systems.

<h3>Roughening of two-dimensional interfaces in nonequilibrium  phase-separated systems</h3>

I show that non-equilibrium two-dimensional interfaces between three
dimensional phase separated fluids exhibit a peculiar "sub-logarithmic"
roughness. Specifically, an interface of lateral extent $L$ will fluctuate
vertically (i.e., normal to the mean surface orientation) a typical RMS
distance $w\equiv\sqrt{\langle |h(\br,t)|^2\rangle} \propto [\ln{(L/a)}]^{1/3}$
(where $a$ is a microscopic length, and $ h(\br,t)$ is the height of the
interface at two dimensional position $\br$ at time $t$). In contrast, the
roughness of equilibrium two-dimensional interfaces between three dimensional
fluids, obeys $w \propto [\ln{(L/a)}]^{1/2}$. The exponent $1/3$ for the active
case is exact. In addition, the characteristic time scales $\tau(L)$ in the
active case scale according to $\tau(L)\propto L^3 [\ln{(L/a)}]^{1/3}$, in
contrast to the simple $\tau(L)\propto L^3$ scaling found in equilibrium
systems with conserved densities and no fluid flow.

<h3>Microscopic mechanism for intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity in  noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06817</a>

<i>Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Satoru Hayami</i>

We theoretically investigate an intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect (INHE) in
space-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric antiferromagnetic metals. The INHE is
characterized by an asymmetric and non-dissipative part of the second-order
electric conductivity tensor in the clean limit in contrast to the Drude-type
symmetric conductivity tensor with dissipation. By introducing a multipole
description, we show that the emergence of the INHE is due to active odd-parity
magnetic quadrupoles or magnetic toroidal dipoles under magnetic orderings. In
order to clarify the microscopic origin of the INHE, we specifically consider a
fundamental tight-binding model of a three-dimensional tetragonal system. We
demonstrate that the INHE arises from the effective coupling between magnetic
ordering and antisymmetric spin--orbit interaction. We also discuss essential
electron hopping paths driving the INHE.

<h3>Non reciprocal odd viscosity: Coarse graining the kinetic energy and  exceptional instability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06901" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06901</a>
<br>
<i>Tomer Markovich, Tom C. Lubensky</i>
<br>
<br>
Odd viscosity couples stress to strain rate in a dissipationless way. It has
been studied in plasmas under magnetic fields, superfluid ${\rm He}^3$, quantum
Hall fluids, and recently in the context of chiral active matter. In most of
these studies odd terms in the viscosity obey Onsager reciprocal relations.
Although this is expected in equilibrium systems, it is not obvious that
Onsager relations hold in active materials. By directly coarse graining the
kinetic energy and using both the Poisson-bracket formalism and a kinetic
theory derivation, we find that the appearance of a non-vanishing angular
momentum density necessarily breaks Onsager reciprocal relations, which leads
to a non-Hermitian dynamical matrix for the total momentum and to the
appearance of odd viscosity and other non-dissipative contributions to the
viscosity. Furthermore, by accounting for both the angular momentum density and
interactions that lead to odd viscosity, we find regions in the parameter space
in which 3D odd mechanical waves propagate and and regions in which they are
mechanically unstable. The lines separating these regions are continuous lines
of exceptional points, suggesting of a non-reciprocal phase transition.

<h3>Odd mobility of a passive tracer in a chiral active fluid</h3>

Chiral active fluids break both time-reversal and parity symmetry, leading to
exotic transport phenomena unobservable in ordinary passive fluids. We develop
a generalized Green-Kubo relation for the anomalous lift experienced by a
passive tracer suspended in a two-dimensional chiral active fluid subjected to
an applied force. This anomalous lift is characterized by a transport
coefficient termed the odd mobility. We validate our generalized response
theory using molecular dynamics simulations, and we show that the asymmetric
tracer mobility may be understood mechanically in terms of asymmetric
deformations of the tracer-fluid density distribution function. We show that
the even and odd components of the mobility decay at different rates with
tracer size, suggesting the possibility of size-based particle separation using
a chiral active working fluid.

<h3>Static and dynamic properties of self-bound droplets of light in hot  vapours</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07037</a>

<br>
<br>
The propagation of light in nonlinear media is well described by a $2$D
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) within the paraxial approximation,
which is equivalent to the Gross-Pitaesvskii equation (GPE), the mean-field
description for the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Due to this
similarity, many theoretical and experimental investigations of phenomena which
have already been studied and realized in BECs have been recently analysed in
alternative experimental platforms such as hot atomic vapours. In this work, we
study the formation of droplets of light in these media, attempting to
establish a mapping between the experimental parameters normally used in BEC
experiments and those needed to observe the analogous phenomenon in hot atomic
vapours. We obtain the energy functional for the susceptibility of the medium
in the $\chi^{(3)}$ , $\chi^{(3)}+\chi^{(5)}$ and saturating regimes for a
two-level atomic configuration considering the focusing (attractive) regime. We
apply a Gaussian variational approach and check its predictions through
numerical simulations of the NLSE for each regime. Finally, we study the
real-time dynamics of the system for both the $\chi^{(3)}+\chi^{(5)}$ and
saturating nonlinearities, focusing our attention on the behaviour of the
breathing mode and on the analysis of droplet formation for realistic
experimental conditions.

<h3>Polymer translocation in an environment of active rods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07114" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07114</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider the dynamics of a translocation process of a flexible linear
polymer through a nanopore into an environment of active rods in the {\it
trans} side. Using Langevin dynamics simulations we find that the rods
facilitate translocation to the {\it trans} side even when there are initially
more monomers on the {\it cis} than on the {\it trans} side. Structural
analysis of the translocating polymer reveals that active rods induce a folded
structure to the {\it trans}-side subchain in the case of successful
translocation events. By keeping the initial number of monomers on the {\it
cis}-side subchain fixed, we map out a state diagram for successful events as a
function of the rod number density for a variety of system parameters. This
reveals competition between facilitation by the rods at low densities and
crowding that hinders translocation at higher densities.

<h3>Translocation of an Active Polymer into a Circular Cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07115" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07115</a>
<br>
<i>Amir Rezaie-Dereshgi, Hamidreza Khalilian, Jalal Sarabadani</i>
<br>
<br>
Translocation dynamics of an active semi-flexible polymer through a nano-pore
into a rigid two dimensional circular cavity, and the polymer packing dynamics
have been studied by using Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations. The results show
that the force exponent $\beta$, for regime of small cavity radius, i.e. $R \ll
R_{\textrm{g}}$, where $R_{\textrm{g}}$ is the gyration radius of the passive
semi-flexible polymer in two dimensional free space, is $\beta=-1$, while for
large values of $R \gg R_{\textrm{g}}$ the asymptotic value of the force
exponent is $\beta \approx -0.92$. The force exponent is defined by the scaling
form of the average translocation time $\langle \tau \rangle \propto
F_{\textrm{sp}}^{\beta}$, where $F_{\textrm{sp}}$ is the self-propelling force.
Moreover, using the definition of the turning number for the polymer inside the
cavity, it has been found that at the end of translocation process for small
value of $R$ and in the strong force limit the polymer configuration is more
regular than the case in which the value of $R$ is large or the force is weak.

<h3>Tunable boson-assisted finite-range interaction and engineering Majorana  corner modes in optical lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonlocal interaction between ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices can
give rise to interesting quantum many-body phenomena. However, its realization
usually demands unconventional techniques, for example the artificial gauge
fields or higher-orbit Feshbach resonances, and is not highly controllable.
Here, we propose a valid and feasible scheme for realizing a tunable
finite-range interaction for spinless fermions immersed into the bath of
bosons. The strength of the effective interaction for the fermionic subsystem
is artificially tunable by manipulating bosons, ranging from the repulsive to
attractive regime. And the interaction distance is locked to the hopping of
bosons, making the finite-range interaction perfectly clean for the fermionic
subsystem. Specifically we find that, by introducing an additional staggered
hopping of bosons, the proposal is readily applied to search the Majorana
corner modes in such a spinless system, without implementation of complex
artificial gauge fields, which is totally distinct from existing results
reported in spinful systems. Therefore this scheme provides a potential
platform for exploring the unconventional topological superfluids and other
nontrivial phases induced by long-range interactions in ultracold atoms.

<h3>A computational method to estimate spin-orbital interaction strength in  solid state systems</h3>

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) drives interesting and non-trivial phenomena in
solid state physics, ranging from topological to magnetic to transport
properties. Thorough study of such phenomena often require effective models
where SOC term is explicitly included. However, estimation of SOC strength for
such models mostly depend on the spectroscopy experiments which can only
provide a rough estimate. In this work, we provide a simple yet effective
computational approach to estimate the on-site SOC strength using a combination
of the $ab$ $initio$ and tight-binding calculations. We demonstrate the wider
applicability and high sensitivity of our method considering materials with
varying SOC strengths and the number of SOC active ions. The estimated SOC
strengths agree well with the proposed values in literature lending support to
our methodology. This simplistic approach can readily be applied to a wide
range of materials.

<h3>A distributed, active patch antenna model of a Josephson oscillator</h3>

Optimization of Josephson oscillators requires a quantitative understanding
of their microwave properties. A Josephson junction has a geometry similar to a
microstrip patch antenna. However, it is biased by a dc-current, distributed
over the whole area of the junction. The oscillating electric field is
generated internally via the ac-Josephson effect. In this work I present a
distributed, active patch antenna model of a Josephson oscillator. It takes
into account the internal Josephson electrodynamics and allows determination of
the effective input resistance, which couples Josephson current to cavity modes
in the transmission line formed by the junction. The model provides full
characterization of Josephson oscillators and explains the origin of low
radiative power efficiency. Finally, I discuss the design of an optimized
Josephson patch oscillator, capable of reaching high efficiency and radiation
power for emission into free space.

<h3>Modelling diffusive transport of particles interacting with slit  nanopore walls: The case of fullerenes in toluene filled alumina pores</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07414</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Baer, Paolo Malgaretti, Malte Kaspereit, Jens Harting, Ana-Suncana Smith</i>
<br>
<br>
Accurate modeling of diffusive transport of nanoparticles across nanopores is
a particularly challenging problem. The reason is that for such narrow pores
the large surface-to-volume ratio amplifies the relevance of the nanoscopic
details and of the effective interactions at the interface with pore walls.
Close to the pore wall, there is no clear separation between the length scales
associated with molecular interactions, layering of the solvent at the
interface with the pore and the particle size. Therefore, the standard
hydrodynamic arguments may not apply and alternative solutions to determining
average transport coefficients need to be developed. We here address this
problem by offering a multiscale ansatz that uses effective potentials
determined from molecular dynamics simulations to parametrise a four state
stochastic model for the positional configuration of the particle in the pore.
This is in turn combined with diffusivities in the centre of the pore and at
the pore wall to calculate the average diffusion constant. We apply this model
to the diffusion of fullerenes in a toluene filled slit nanopore and calculate
the mean diffusion coefficient as a function of the pore size. We show that the
accuracy of our model is affected by the partial slip of the toluene on the
pore wall.

<h3>Revisiting superconductivity in the extended one-band Hubbard model:  pairing via spin and charge fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07423</a>
<br>
<i>Mercè Roig, Astrid T. Rømer, P. J. Hirschfeld, Brian M. Andersen</i>
<br>
<br>
The leading superconducting instabilities of the two-dimensional extended
repulsive one-band Hubbard model within spin-fluctuation pairing theory depend
sensitively on electron density, band and interaction parameters. We map out
the phase diagrams within a random phase approximation (RPA) spin- and
charge-fluctuation approach, and find that while $B_{1g}$ ($d_{x^2-y^2}$) and
$B_{2g}$ ($d_{xy}$) pairing dominates in the absence of repulsive longer-range
Coulomb interactions $V_{\rm NN}$, the latter induces pairing in other symmetry
channels, including e.g $A_{2g}$ ($g$-wave), nodal $A_{1g}$ (extended
$s$-wave), or nodal $E_u$ ($p$-wave) spin-triplet superconductivity. At the
lowest temperatures, transition boundaries in the phase diagrams between
symmetry-distinct spin-singlet orders generate complex time-reversal symmetry
broken superpositions. By contrast, we find that boundaries between singlet and
triplet regions are characterized by first-order transitions. Finally,
motivated by recent photoemission experiments, we have determined the influence
of an additional explicitly attractive nearest-neighbor interaction, $V_{\rm
NN}<0$, on the superconducting gap structure. Depending on the electronic
filling, such an attraction boosts $E_u$ ($p$-wave) spin-triplet or $B_{1g}$
($d_{x^2-y^2}$) spin-singlet ordering.

<h3>The conformational phase diagram of neutral polymers in the presence of  attractive crowders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07481" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07481</a>
<br>
<i>Hitesh Garg, R Rajesh, Satyavani Vemparala</i>
<br>
<br>
Extensive coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations are performed to
investigate the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the
presence of attractive crowders. We show that, for low crowded densities, the
polymer predominantly shows three phases as a function of both intra polymer
and polymer-crowder interactions: (1) weak intra polymer and weak
polymer-crowder attractive interactions induce extended or coil polymer
conformations (phase E) (2) strong intra polymer and relatively weak
polymer-crowder attractive interactions induce collapsed or globular
conformations (phase CI) and (3) strong polymer-crowder attractive
interactions, regardless of intra polymer interactions, induce a second
collapsed or globular conformation that encloses bridging crowders (phase CB).
The detailed phase diagram is obtained by determining the phase boundaries
delineating the different phases based on an analysis of the radius of gyration
as well as bridging crowders. The dependence of the phase diagram on strength
of crowder-crowder attractive interactions and crowder density is clarified. We
also show that when the crowder density is increased, a third collapsed phase
of the polymer emerges for weak intra polymer attractive interactions. This
crowder density induced compaction is shown to be enhanced by stronger
crowder-crowder attraction and is different from the depletion induced collapse
mechanism which is primarily driven by repulsive interactions. We also provide
a unified explanation of the observed reentrant swollen/extended conformations
of earlier simulations of weak and strongly self interacting polymers in terms
of crowder-crowder attractive interactions.

<h3>Non-Maxwellian viscoelastic stress relaxations in soft matter</h3>

Viscoelastic stress relaxation is a basic characteristic of soft matter
systems such as colloids, gels, and biological net-works. Although the Maxwell
model of linear viscoelasticity provides a classical description of stress
relaxation, the Maxwell model is often not sufficient for capturing the complex
relaxation dynamics of soft matter. In this Tutorial, we introduce
non-Maxwellian linear stress relaxation as observed in soft materials, the
putative origins of this effect in different systems, and appropriate models
that can be used to capture this relaxation behavior. We provide a basic
toolkit that can assist the understanding and modeling of the mechanical
relaxation of soft materials for diverse applications.

<h3>Fast electrically switchable large gap quantum spin Hall states in  MGe$_2$Z$_4$</h3>

Spin-polarized conducting edge currents counterpropagate in quantum spin Hall
(QSH) insulators and are protected against disorder-driven localizations by the
time-reversal symmetry. Using these spin-currents for device applications
require materials having large band gap and fast switchable QSH states. By
means of in-depth first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the large band
gap and fast switchable QSH state in a newly introduced two-dimensional (2D)
material family with 1T$^\prime$-MGe$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mo or W and Z = P or As).
The thermodynamically stable 1T$^\prime$-MoGe$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers have a large
energy gap around $\sim$237 meV. These materials undergo a phase transition
from a QSH insulator to a trivial insulator with a Rashba-like spin splitting
under the influence of an out-of-plane electric field, demonstrating the
tunability of the band gap and its band topology. Fast topological phase
switching in a large gap 1T$^\prime$-MoGe$_2$Z$_4$ QSH insulators has potential
applications in low-power devices, quantum computation, and quantum
communication.

<h3>Quantum correlations in the frustrated XY model on the honeycomb lattice</h3>

We consider the spin-$1/2$ XY frustrated antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
honeycomb model. There is an unclear intermediate region in the ground state
phase diagram of the model. The most recognized phases are the quantum
spin-liquid (QSL) and the antiferromagnetic Ising ordering. From the viewpoint
of the quantum correlations, the QSL phase is expected to be entangled.
Motivated by this fact, we have calculated the concurrence, the quantum discord
(QD), and the entanglement entropy, by using numerical Lanczos and density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results explicitly show that
the intermediate region should be entangled supporting the QSL phase.

<h3>Ubiquity of light small pairs in Hubbard models with long range hoppings  and interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06498" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06498</a>
<br>
<i>G.D. Adebanjo, J.P. Hague, P.E. Kornilovitch</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we examine how next-nearest neighbor hopping and interaction
affect pairing properties, concluding that small and light pairs are ubiquitous
in extended Hubbard models with long-range interactions and hopping. We are
motivated by two unconventional superconductors, the cuprates and fullerides,
which have similar ratios of transition temperature to bandwidth. Cuprates have
large next-nearest neighbor hopping. The highest temperature fulleride
superconductor has BCC structure with similar nearest and next-nearest neighbor
distances (and thus interactions and hoppings on those length scales). We
determine pair properties for an extended Hubbard model with large Hubbard $U$
and both near- and next-nearest neighbor hopping and attraction, on a range of
lattices using both numerical and analytical approaches. We find that the
presence of next-nearest neighbor hopping, $t'$ and near- and next-nearest
neighbor attraction ($V$ and $V'$) very significantly lowers the pair mass in a
wide range of lattices. The pair mass decreases with increased $t'$ and $V'$
(where it has a minimum when $V'=V$). The presence of both $t'$ and $V'$ leads
ubiquitously to small strongly bound pairs with an inverse mass that is linear
in hopping, which could lead to high temperature Bose--Einstein condensation
(BEC).

<h3>Defect contrast with 4D-STEM: Applications of virtual detectors and beam  modification</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06511" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06511</a>

<br>
<br>
Material properties strongly depend on the nature and concentration of
defects. Characterizing these features may require nano- to atomic-scale
resolution to establish structure-property relationships. 4D-STEM, a technique
where diffraction patterns are acquired at a grid of points on the sample,
provides a versatile method for highlighting defects. Computational analysis of
the diffraction patterns with virtual detectors produces images that can map a
variety of material properties. Here, we explore different virtual detectors
that can be applied to the diffraction patterns that go beyond the binary
detector response functions that are possible using ordinary STEM detectors.
Using graphene and lead titanate as model systems, we investigate the
application of virtual detectors to highlight local order and in particular
defects. We find that using a small convergence angle with a rotationally
varying detector most efficiently highlights defect signals. Phase and
amplitude modification of the electron beam provides another process handle to
change image contrast in a 4D-STEM experiment. We demonstrate how tailored
electron beams can enhance signals from short-range order and how a vortex beam
can be used to characterize local symmetry.

<h3>Contact Angle Studies on Porous Silicon: Evidence for Heterogeneous  Wetting and Implications of Oxidation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06554</a>
<br>
<i>S. J. Spencer, C. G. Deacon, G. T. Andrews</i>
<br>
<br>
A study of wetting was carried out on porous silicon films with pore
diameters spanning three orders of magnitude. Water contact angle measurements
on adjoining porous and nonporous regions yielded Wenzel roughness ratios that
were either unphysical (less than unity) or unrealistically low when compared
to those expected from specific surface area considerations. Moreover, results
obtained from a sample consisting of a microporous film on a macroporous layer
gave contact angles that were very similar to those found on films consisting
of only a single microporous layer, contrary to what would be expected for
complete filling of the pores by liquid. Values for wetted surface fractions
calculated from the Cassie-Baxter model are unreasonably high for micro- ,
meso- and oxidized macroporous films considering their porosities, while
relatively oxide-free macroporous films give wetted surface fractions in accord
with those expected based on film porosity. Collectively, these results show
that the predominant mode of wetting on these films is heterogeneous.

<h3>Approaching intrinsic threshold breakdown voltage and ultra-high gain in  graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector</h3>

<br>
<br>
Realizing both ultra-low breakdown voltage and ultra-high gain has been one
of the major challenges in the development of high-performance avalanche
photodetector. Here, we report that an ultra-high avalanche gain of 3*10^5 can
be realized in the graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector at a breakdown voltage
down to 5.5 V. Remarkably, the threshold breakdown voltage can be further
reduced down to 1.8 V by raising the operating temperature, approaching the
theoretical limit of 1.5E_g/e with E_g the band gap of semiconductor. We
develop a two-dimensional impact ionization model and uncover that observation
of high gain at low breakdown voltage arises from reduced dimensionality of
electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering in the layered InSe flake. Our findings open
up a promising avenue for developing novel weak-light detectors with low energy
consumption and high sensitivity.

The theoretical discovery of new and stable 2D penta materials has stimulated
the technological advancement due to the anticipated exotic properties of such
structure, including the recent $\alpha$ phase and $\beta$ phase of penta-NiPS
based on first-principles calculations. Inspired by the similarity between the
theoretically proposed penta-NiPS and the experimentally synthesized ($\alpha$
phase) of penta-PdPSe, we preposed herein the $\beta$ phase penta-PdPSe as a
new member of the penta-2D materials. Comprehensive analysis indicated that the
$\beta$ phase penta-PdPSe is thermodynamically, dynamically, mechanically, and
thermally stable, similar to the NiPS analog. It was found that $\beta$
penta-PdPSe is a wide band gap semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.58
eV, significantly lower than 2.15 eV for the $\alpha$ phase. Moreover, the two
polymorphs of penta-PdPSe are a soft material with 2D Young's modulus of $E_a$
= 151 Nm$^-1$ and $E_b$ = 123 Nm$^-1$ for the $\beta$ phase, to be compared
with $E_a$ = 155 Nm$^-1$ and $E_b$ = 113 Nm$^-1$ for the $\alpha$ phase. The
calculated adsorption coefficient shows that $\beta$ phase penta-PdPSe is
acceptable for electronic and optical nanodevice.

The building block of in-memory computing with spintronic devices is mainly
based on the magnetic tunnel junction with perpendicular interfacial anisotropy
(p-MTJ). The resulting asymmetric write and read-out operations impose
challenges in downscaling and direct cascadability of p-MTJ devices. Here, we
propose that a new symmetric write and read-out mechanism can be realized in
perpendicular-anisotropy spin-orbit (PASO) quantum materials based on Fe3GeTe2
and WTe2. We demonstrate that field-free and deterministic reversal of the
perpendicular magnetization can be achieved by employing unconventional charge
to z-spin conversion. The resulting magnetic state can be readily probed with
its intrinsic inverse process, i.e., z-spin to charge conversion. Using the
PASO quantum material as a fundamental building block, we implement the
functionally complete set of logic-in-memory operations and a more complex
nonvolatile half-adder logic function. Our work highlights the potential of
PASO quantum materials for the development of scalable energy-efficient and
ultrafast spintronic computing.

Various physical properties (electronic, optical and thermoelectric) of cubic
perovskite oxides $SrXO_3\; (X=Sc,\; Ge,\; Si)$ are investigated by using the
density functional theory (DFT) within Wien2k code. This code is based on
different approximations such as generalized gradient approximation GGA,
PBEsol, LDA, WC and the modified Becke-Johnson exchange potentials (mBJ, nmBJ
and unmBJ). Structural properties and the optimization have been calculated
using PBEsol functional which showed a significant results that are in good
agreement with the experimental ones. The results for physical properties such
as electronic, thermoelectric and optical are analyzed in detail by using the
nmBJ approximation. The obtained results present an opening gap for $SrSiO_3$,
$SrGeO_3$ and a metallic behavior for $SrScO_3$. An average of transmittance
which is about $94\%$ to $97\%$ was observed in the range of visible light. The
increase of electrical conductivity with temperature confirms the effect of
thermal agitation on the concentration of charges carriers using BolzTrap
Package. Lastly a phonon dispersion was made and show that for $X=\; Ge$ and
$Si$, the structure is relatively stable while $SrScO_3$ is dynamically
unstable. These results prove the ability that these materials can be exploited
in many applications and manufacturing of optoelectronics for Sensors.

Topologically stable magnetic skyrmion has a much lower depinning current
density that may be useful for memory as well as neuromorphic computing.
However, skyrmion-based devices suffer from the Magnus force originating from
the skyrmion Hall effect, which may result in unwanted skyrmion annihilation if
the magnitude of the driving current gets too large. A design of an artificial
neuron and a synapse using a synthetic antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer
device, which nullifies the Magnus force, is demonstrated in this work. The
leak term in the artificial leaky integrate-and-fire neuron is achieved by
engineering the uniaxial anisotropy profile of the neuronal device. The
synaptic device has a similar structure as the neuronal device but has a
constant uniaxial anisotropy. The synaptic device also has a linear and
symmetric weight update, which is a highly desirable trait of an artificial
synapse. Neuronal and synaptic devices based on magnetic domain-wall (DW)
motion are also studied and compared to skyrmionic devices. Our simulation
results show the energy required to perform such operation in DW or
skyrmion-based devices is on the order of a few fJ.

<h3>Topological Gauge Fields and the Composite Particle Duality</h3>

We introduce topological gauge fields as nontrivial field configurations
enforced by topological currents. These fields crucially determine the form of
statistical gauge fields that couple to matter and transmute their statistics.
We discuss the physical mechanism underlying the composite particle picture and
argue that it is a duality of gauge forms that naturally relates to the notion
of bosonisation in arbitrary dimensions. This is based on obtaining a
generalised version of flux attachment, which yields a density-dependent gauge
potential. We recover well-known results, resolve old controversies, and
suggest a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of such a gauge field. We
also outline potential directions for experimental realisations in ultracold
atom platforms.

Wires made of topological insulators (TI) are a promising platform for
searching for Majorana bound states. These states can be probed by analyzing
the fractional ac Josephson effect in Josephson junctions with the TI wire as a
weak link. An axial magnetic field can be used to tune the system from trivial
to topologically nontrivial. Here we investigate the oscillations of the
supercurrent in such wire Josephson junctions as a function of the axial
magnetic field strength and different contact transparencies. Although the
current flows on average parallel to the magnetic field we observe $h/2e$,
$h/4e$- and even $h/8e$-periodic oscillations of the supercurrent in samples
with lower contact transparencies. Corresponding tight-binding transport
simulations using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes model Hamiltonian yield the
supercurrent through the Josephson junctions, showing in particular the
peculiar $h/4e$-periodic oscillations observed in experiments. A further
semiclassical analysis based on Andreev-reflected trajectories connecting the
two superconductors allows us to identify the physical origin of these
oscillations. They can be related to flux-enclosing paths winding around the
TI-nanowire, thereby highlighting the three-dimensional character of the
junction geometry compared to common planar junctions.

<br>
<br>
The proximity effect in semiconductor-superconductor nanowires is expected to
generate an induced gap in the semiconductor. The magnitude of this induced
gap, together with the semiconductor properties like the spin-orbit coupling
and $g$\,-\,factor, depends on the coupling between the materials. It is
predicted that this coupling can be adjusted through the use of electric
fields. We study this phenomena in InSb/Al/Pt hybrids using nonlocal
spectroscopy. We show that these hybrids can be tuned such that the
semiconductor and superconductor are strongly coupled. In this case, the
induced gap is similar to the superconducting gap in the Al/Pt shell and closes
only at high magnetic fields. In contrast, the coupling can be suppressed which
leads to a strong reduction of the induced gap and critical magnetic field. At
the crossover between the strong-coupling and weak-coupling regimes, we observe
the closing and reopening of the induced gap in the bulk of a nanowire.
Contrary to expectations, it is not accompanied by the formation of zero-bias
peaks in the local conductance spectra. As a result, this cannot be attributed
conclusively to the anticipated topological phase transition and we discuss
possible alternative explanations.

<br>
<br>
Rhombohedrally stacked MoS2 has been shown to exhibit spontaneous
polarization down to the bilayer limit and can sustain a strong depolarization
field when sandwiched between graphene. Such a field gives rise to a
spontaneous photovoltaic effect without needing any p-n junction. In this work,
we show the photovoltaic effect has an external quantum efficiency of 10\% for
devices with only two atomic layers of MoS2 at low temperatures, and identify a
picosecond-fast photocurrent response, which translates to an intrinsic device
bandwidth at ~ 100-GHz level. To this end, we have developed a non-degenerate
pump-probe photocurrent spectroscopy technique to deconvolute the thermal and
charge-transfer processes, thus successfully revealing the multi-component
nature of the photocurrent dynamics. The fast component approaches the limit of
the charge-transfer speed at the graphene-MoS2 interface. The remarkable
efficiency and ultrafast photoresponse in the graphene-3R-MoS2 devices support
the use of ferroelectric van der Waals materials for future high-performance
optoelectronic applications.

Little is so far known about the magnetism of the $\rm A_2B_2O_7$ monoclinic
layered perovskites that replace the spin-ice supporting pyrochlore structure
for $r_A/r_B>1.78$. We show that high quality monoclinic Pr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$
single crystals with a three-dimensional network of non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions
that interact through edge-sharing super-exchange interactions, form a singlet
ground state quantum paramagnet that does not undergo any magnetic phase
transitions down to at least 1.8 K. The chemical phase stability, structure,
and magnetic properties of the layered perovskite Pr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ were
investigated using x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and
magnetization measurements. Synthesis of polycrystalline samples with the
nominal compositions of Pr$_2$Ti$_{2+x}$O$_7$ ($-0.16 \leq x \leq 0.16$) showed
that deviations from the Pr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ stoichiometry lead to secondary
phases of related, structures including the perovskite phase Pr$_{2/3}$TiO$_3$
and the orthorhombic phases Pr$_4$Ti$_9$O$_{24}$ and Pr$_2$TiO$_5$. No
indications of site disordering (stuffing and anti-stuffing) or vacancy defects
were observed in the Pr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ majority phase. A procedure for growth
of high-structural-quality, stoichiometric single crystals of Pr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$
by the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method is reported.
Thermo-magnetic measurements of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ reveal an
isolated singlet ground state that we associate with the low symmetry crystal
electric field environments that split the $2J+1=9$-fold degenerate
spin-orbital multiplets of the four differently coordinated Pr$^{3+}$ ions into
36 isolated singlets resulting in an anisotropic temperature independent
van-Vleck susceptibility at low $T$. A small isotropic Curie term is associated
with 0.96(2)\% non-interacting Pr$^{4+}$ impurities.

In this work we present a model system built out of artificially layered
materials, allowing us to understand the interrelation of magnetic phases with
that of the metallic-insulating phase at long length-scales, and enabling new
strategies for the design and control of materials in devices. The artificial
model system consists of superlattices made of SmNiO$_3$ and NdNiO$_3$ layers
-- two members of the fascinating rare earth nickelate family, having different
metal-to-insulator and magnetic transition temperatures. By combining two
complementary techniques -- resonant elastic x-ray scattering and muon spin
relaxation -- we show how the magnetic order evolves, in this complex
multicomponent system, as a function of temperature and superlattice
periodicity. We demonstrate that the length scale of the coupling between the
antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is longer than that of the electronic
metal-insulator phase transition -- despite being subsidiary to it. This can be
explained via a Landau theory -- where the bulk magnetic energy plus a gradient
cost between magnetic and non magnetic phases are considered. These results
provide a clear understanding of the coupling of magnetic transitions in
systems sharing identical order parameters.

Critically elastic materials - those that are rigid with a single state of
self-stress - can be generated from parent systems with two states of
self-stress by the removal of one of many constraints. We show that the elastic
moduli of the resulting homogeneous and isotropic daughter systems are
interrelated by a universal functional form parametrized by properties of the
parent. In simulations of both spring networks and packings of soft spheres,
judicious choice of parent systems and bond removal allows for the selection of
a wide variety of moduli and Poisson's ratios in the critically elastic
systems, providing a framework for versatile deterministic selection of
mechanical properties.

<br>
Topological vacua are a family of degenerate ground states of Yang-Mills
fields with zero field strength but nontrivial topological structures. They
play a fundamental role in particle physics and quantum field theory, but have
not yet been experimentally observed. Here we report the first theoretical
proposal and experimental realization of synthetic topological vacua with a
cloud of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Our setup provides a promising
platform to demonstrate the fundamental concept that a vacuum, rather than
being empty, has rich spatial structures. The Hamiltonian for the vacuum of
topological number n = 1 is synthesized and the related Hopf index is measured.
The vacuum of topological number n = 2 is also realized, and we find that vacua
with different topological numbers have distinctive spin textures and Hopf
links. Our work opens up opportunities for exploring topological vacua and
related long-sought-after instantons in tabletop experiments.

By using the tensor-network state algorithm, we study a spin-orbital model
with SU(2)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry on the triangular lattice. This
model was proposed to describe some triangular $d^1$ materials and was argued
to host a spin-orbital liquid ground state. In our work the trial wavefunction
of its ground state is approximated by an infinite projected entangled simplex
state and optimized by the imaginary-time evolution. Contrary to the previous
conjecture, we find that the two SU(2) symmetries are broken, resulting in a
stripe spin-orbital order with the same magnitude $m=0.085(10)$. This value is
about half of that in the spin-1/2 triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Our
result demonstrates that although the long-sought spin-orbital liquid is absent
in this model the spin-orbital order is significantly reduced due to the
enhanced quantum fluctuation. This suggests that high-symmetry spin-orbital
models are promising in searching for exotic states of matter in
condensed-matter physics.

The recent synthesis of the chromium selenide compound LiCrSe$_2$ constitutes
a valuable addition to the ensemble of two-dimensional triangular lattice
antiferromagnets (2D-TLA). In this work we present the very first comprehensive
study of the combined low temperature nuclear and magnetic structure
established in this material. Details on the connection between Li-ion dynamics
and structural changes are also presented along with a direct link between
atomic structure and spin order via a strong magnetoelastic coupling.
LiCrSe$_2$ was found to undergo a first order structural transition from a
trigonal crystal system with space group $P\bar{3}m1$ to a monoclinic one with
space group $C2/m$ at $T_{\rm s}=30$~K. Such restructuring of the lattice is
accompanied by a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}=30$~K, with the formation of
a complex spin arrangement for the Cr$^{3+}$ moments. Refinement of the
magnetic structure with neutron diffraction data and complementary muon spin
rotation analysis reveal the presence of two incommensurate magnetic domains
with a up-up-down-down arrangement of the spins with ferromagnetic (FM) double
chains coupled antiferromagnetically (AFM). In addition to this unusual
arrangement, the spin axial vector is modulated both in direction and modulus,
resulting in a spin density wave-like order with periodic suppression of the Cr
moment along the chains. This behavior is believed to appear as a result of
strong competition between direct exchange AFM and superexchange FM couplings
established between both nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor Cr$^{3+}$
ions. We finally conjecture that the resulting magnetic order is stabilized via
subtle vacancy/charge order within the Li layers, potentially causing a mix of
two different magnetic phases within the sample.

It has recently been shown that in one-dimensional hard-point gases, there is
a mechanism that induces negative differential thermal resistance (NDTR)
between heat baths. We examine this mechanism in more general higher
dimensional fluids described by multiparticle collision dynamics. We consider
fluids in a finite cuboid region of three-dimensional space with each end in
contact with a heat bath. Based on analytical results and numerical models, we
find that the mechanism underlying NDTR also works for high-dimensional fluidic
systems with weak interactions and is very robust to mixed fluids. Our results
significantly advance knowledge of NDTR induced by heat bath and illuminate new
directions to explore in fabricating fluid thermal transistors in micro- and
nanosystems.

Workflows have been developed in the past decade to enable atom probe
tomography analysis at cryogenic temperatures. The inability to control the
local deposition of the metallic precursor from the gas-injection system (GIS)
at cryogenic temperature makes the preparation of site-specific specimens by
using lift-out extremely challenging in the focused-ion beam. Schreiber et al.
exploited redeposition to weld the lifted-out sample to a support. Here we
build on their approach to attach the region-of-interest and additionally
strengthen the interface with locally sputtered metal from the
micromanipulator. Following standard focused-ion beam annular milling, we
demonstrate atom probe analysis of Si in both laser pulsing and voltage mode,
with comparable analytical performance as a pre-sharpened microtip coupon. Our
welding approach is versatile, as various metals could be used for sputtering,
and allows similar flexibility as the GIS in principle.

<i>Daniel Hexner</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a training rule that enables a network composed of springs and
dashpots to learn precise stress patterns. Our goal is to control the tensions
on a fraction of "target" bonds, which are chosen randomly. The system is
trained by applying stresses to the target bonds, causing the remaining bonds,
which act as the learning degrees of freedom, to evolve. Different criteria for
selecting the target bonds affects whether frustration is present. When there
is at most a single target bond per node the error converges to computer
precision. Additional targets on a single node may lead to slow convergence and
failure. Nonetheless, training is successful even when approaching the limit
predicted by the Maxwell Calladine theorem. We demonstrate the generality of
these ideas by considering dashpots with yield stresses. We show that training
converges, albeit with a slower, power-law decay of the error. Furthermore,
dashpots with yielding stresses prevent the system from relaxing after
training, enabling to encode permanent memories.

We show that formamidinium lead bromide is unique among the halide perovskite
crystals because its inorganic sub-lattice exhibits intrinsic local static
disorder that co-exists with a well-defined average crystal structure. Our
study combines THz-range Raman-scattering with single-crystal X-ray diffraction
and first-principles calculations to probe the inorganic sub-lattice dynamics
evolution with temperature in the range of 10-300 K. The temperature evolution
of the Raman spectra shows that low-temperature, local static disorder strongly
affects the crystal's structural dynamics and phase transitions at higher
temperatures.

The study of interaction between different degrees of freedom in solids is of
fundamental importance to understand the functionalities of materials. One
striking example of such interaction is the intertwined coupling or competition
between superconductivity (SC), charge density wave (CDW), pseudogap state
(PG), and other exotic phases in cuprate superconductors. Recent emergence of
nonlinear Terahertz (THz) third harmonic generation (THG) spectroscopy provides
a powerful tool for exploring the collective (Higgs) modes of superconductivity
order parameters, and its interaction with intertwined/competing phases. In
this study, we report on nonlinear THz THG spectroscopy of the
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO) thin films with different doping. We identify a
characteristic temperature $T_{THG}$, below which third order suscepetility
$\chi^{(3)}$ emerges. Notably, the $T_{THG}$ is coincident with the crossover
temperature $T^*$ of pseudogap in a wide range doping of phase diagram. Upon
entering the superconducting state, THG increases sharply but exhibits an
abnormal dip feature near $T_c$ which is more clearly seen in optimally doped
sample. Strikingly, we observe a beating structure directly in the measured
real time waveform of THG signal. Fourier transformation of the time domain
waveform gives two separate modes below and above original THG frequency. The
observation strongly indicates that an additional mode, presumably Higgs mode,
appears at $T_c$ and couples to the mode already developed below $T^*$. The
strong coupling effect offers new insight into the interplay between
superconductivity and pseudogap. The result unambiguously suggests that the
pseudogap phase is not a precursor of superconductivity but represents a
distinct order.

Understanding the cavity formation and cavity growth mechanisms in solids has
fundamental and applied importance for the correct determination of their
exploitation capabilities and mechanical characteristics. In this work, we
present the molecular dynamics simulation results for the process of
homogeneous formation of nanosized cavities in a single-component amorphous
metallic alloy. To identify cavities of various shapes and sizes, an original
method has been developed, which is based on filling cavities by virtual
particles (balls) of the same diameter. By means of the mean first-passage time
analysis, it was shown that the cavity formation in an amorphous metallic melt
is the activation-type process. This process can be described in terms of the
classical nucleation theory, which is usually applied to the case of first
order phase transitions. Activation energy, critical size and nucleation rate
of cavities are calculated, the values of which are comparable with those for
the case of crystal nucleation in amorphous systems.

<h3>Kinetics of inherent processes counteracting crystallization in  supercooled monatomic liquid</h3>

Crystallization of supercooled liquids is mainly determined by two competing
processes associated with the transition of particles (atoms) from liquid phase
to crystalline one and, vice versa, with the return of particles from
crystalline phase to liquid one. The quantitative characteristics of these
processes are the so-called attachment rate $g^{+}$ and the detachment rate
$g^{-}$, which determine how particles change their belonging from one phase to
another. In the present study, a {\it correspondence rule} between the rates
$g^{+}$ and $g^{-}$ as functions of the size $N$ of growing crystalline nuclei
is defined for the first time. In contrast to the well-known detailed balance
condition, which relates $g^{+}(N)$ and $g^{-}(N)$ at $N=n_c$ (where $n_c$ is
the critical nucleus size) and is satisfied only at the beginning of the
nucleation regime, the found {\it correspondence rule} is fulfilled at all the
main stages of crystallization kinetics (crystal nucleation, growth and
coalescence). On the example of crystallizing supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid,
the rate $g^{-}$ was calculated for the first time at different supercooling
levels and for the wide range of nucleus sizes $N\in[n_c;\,40\,n_c]$. It was
found that for the whole range of nucleus sizes, the detachment rate $g^{-}$ is
only $\approx2$\% less than the attachment rate $g^{+}$. This is direct
evidence that the role of the processes that counteract crystallization remains
significant at all the stages of crystallization. Based on the obtained
results, a kinetic equation was formulated for the time-dependent distribution
function of the nucleus sizes, that is an alternative to the well-known kinetic
Becker-D\"{o}ring-Zeldovich-Frenkel equation.

Porous crystalline nitinol is widely applied in various fields of science and
technology due to the unique combination of physical and mechanical properties
as well as biocompatibility. Porous amorphous nitinol is characterized by
improved mechanical properties compared to its crystalline analogues. Moreover,
this material is more promising from the point of view of fundamental study and
practical application. The production of porous amorphous nitinol is a
difficult task requiring rapid cooling protocol and optimal conditions to form
a stable porous structure. In the present work, based on the results of
molecular dynamics simulations, we show that porous nitinol with the amorphous
matrix can be obtained by injection of argon into a liquid melt followed by
rapid cooling of the resulting mixture. We find that the porosity of the system
increases exponentially with increasing fraction of injected argon. It has been
established that the system should contain about $\sim18$--$23$\% argon for
obtain an open porous structure, while the system is destroyed by overheated
inert gas when the argon fraction is more than $\sim23$\%. It is shown that the
method of argon injection makes it possible to obtain a highly porous system
with the porosity $\sim70$\% consisting the spongy porous structure similar to
aerogels and metallic foams.

Binary Ni$_{62}$Nb$_{38}$ alloy belongs to the unique class of binary
off-eutectic systems, which are able to form a bulk glassy state [L. Xia et
al., J. Appl. Phys. 99 (2006) 026103]. In the present work, the ($p$, $T$)
phase diagram of Ni$_{62}$Nb$_{38}$ alloy was first determined for a wide
thermodynamic range with temperatures from $300$\,K to $6000$\,K and with
pressures from $1$\,atm to $1.2\times10^7$\,atm. For this thermodynamic range,
elements of the phase diagram such as the liquid-crystal coexistence line and
the glass transition line are defined. Our results reveal good agreement
between the simulation results and the known experimental values of the
liquidus temperature and the glass transition temperature for the isobar
$p=1$\,atm. The phase diagram is detailed for pressures greater than
$1\times10^{7}$\,atm. For the first time, the phase separation conditions at
which the liquid Nb and crystalline Ni phases coexist in the system were
determined.

<h3>A structural hysteresis in the charge density wave transition of 1T-TaS2</h3>

<br>
<br>
In quasi-two-dimensional 1T-TaS2, a charge density wave (CDW) prototype, the
transition occurs in two steps, from incommensurate (ICDW) and nearly
commensurate (NCCDW) and from NCDW to commensurate (CCDW), locked in the
resistivity step-wise behavior. The hysteresis observed in the resistivity
across the NCDW-to-CCDW transition has roots to a structural hysteresis, where
local distortions of the sqrt(13)a x sqrt(13)a superstructure are revealed by
neutron and X-ray diffraction. The structural hysteresis is due to faulty stars
of David (SODs) because of Ta displacements away from the perfect trigonal
geometry as well as out of plane S distortions. Furthermore, the superstructure
exhibits a 3co layer stacking order that weakens on warming and fully
disappears in the ICDW state.

We propose a generic scenario for metastability and excitation-induced
switching in layered materials. Focusing on a minimal bilayer stack, where each
layer consists of a honeycomb lattice with A and B sublattices, we map out the
energy landscape with respect to the relative sliding of the layers. The
sliding affects the interlayer hopping, which induces a splitting between
bonding and anti-bonding bands. When this splitting is large, the AA and AB
stacking configurations correspond to the global and secondary minima,
respectively, and these configurations are separated by a barrier against
layer-sliding. While chemical doping only flattens this barrier, strong
\emph{photodoping} from bonding to antibonding bands can transiently
destabilize the global minimum and induce a sliding motion toward the AB
stacked configuration, thereby switching from an equilibrium insulator to a
nearly gapless metastable phase. This hopping-driven effect is enhanced by
local repulsive interactions, which increase the gap and facilitate the
inter-layer sliding.

Wurtzite Boron Nitride ($w$BN) is a wide band gap BN polymorph with peculiar
mechanical properties (hardness and stiffness). After its first synthesis in
1963 as a transformation of hexagonal BN ($h$BN) under high temperature and
pressure conditions, a lot of progress have been made in order to stabilize
wurtzite phase at atmospheric pressure. Today the crystallization of good
quality samples is finally possible. This fact motivates our first principles
study of the electronic, vibrational and light absorption and emission
properties of $w$BN over a wide range of pressures. Our findings are important
in view of the potential use of $w$BN as a dielectric for integration in
BN-based technologies in optoelectronics and harsh environment applications.

Identifying and characterizing new magnetic systems with Co2+ ions can
enhance our understanding of quantum behavior since Co2+ can host a
pseudospin-1/2 magnetic ground state. Understanding the magnetic ground state
and the phase diagrams of such systems are central to the development of new
theoretical models to described emergent quantum properties of complex magnetic
systems. The sawtooth chain compound, CsCo2MoO4_2OH, is one such complex
magnetic system and here, we present a comprehensive series of magnetic and
neutron scattering measurements to determine its magnetic phase diagram. The
magnetic properties of CsCo2MoO4_2OH exhibit a strong coupling to the crystal
lattice and its magnetic ground state can be easily manipulated by applied
magnetic fields. There are two unique Co2+ ions, base and vertex, with Jbb and
Jbv magnetic exchange. The magnetism is highly anisotropic with the b-axis
(chain) along the easy axis and the material orders antiferromagnetically at TN
= 5 K. The zero field antiferromagnetic phase contains vertex magnetic vectors
Co1 aligned parallel to the b-axis, while the base vectors Co2 are canted by 34
and aligned in an opposite direction to the vertex vectors. The spins in
parallel adjacent chains align in opposite directions, creating an overall
antiferromagnetic structure. At a 3 kOe applied magnetic field, adjacent chains
flip by 180{\deg} to generate a ferrimagnetic phase. An increase in field
gradually induces the Co(1) moment to rotate along the b-axis and align in the
same direction with Co2 generating a ferromagnetic structure. Our results
demonstrate that the CsCo2MoO4_2OH is a promising candidate to study new
physics associated with sawtooth chain magnetism.

<h3>Unsteady wetting of soft solids</h3>

From hydrogels and plastics to liquid crystals, soft solids cover a wide
array of synthetic and biological materials that play key enabling roles in
advanced technologies such as 3D printing, soft robotics, wearable electronics,
self-assembly, and bioartificial tissues. Their elasticity and stimuli-induced
changes in mechanical, optical, or electrical properties offer a unique
advantage in designing and creating new dynamically functional components for
sensing, micro-actuation, colour changes, information, and mass transport. To
harness the vast potential of soft solids, a thorough understanding of their
reactions when exposed to liquids is needed. Attempts to study the interactions
between soft solids and liquids have largely focused on the wetting of soft
solids and its resulting deformation at equilibrium or in a quasi-static state.
Here, we consider the frequently encountered case of unsteady wetting of a
liquid on a soft solid and show that transient deformation of the solid is
necessary to understand unsteady wetting behaviours. We find that the initial
spreading of the liquid occurs uninterrupted in the absence of solid
deformation. This is followed by intermittent spreading, in which transient
deformation of the solid at the three-phase contact line (CL) causes the CL
motion to alternate alternation between CL sticking and slipping. We identify
the spreading rate of liquids and the viscoelastic reacting rate of soft solids
as the two competing factors in dictating intermittent spreading. We formulate
and validate experimentally the conditions required for the contact line to
transition from sticking to slipping. By considering the growing deformation of
soft solids as dynamic surface heterogeneities, our proposed conditions for
stick-slip transition in unsteady wetting on soft solids broaden the classical
theory on wetting hysteresis on rigid solids.

In a recent comment by Fern\'{a}ndez, it has been argued that our solution
method of an effective Hamiltonian based on the characteristic polynomial
[Phys. Lett. A 443 (2022) 128215] had been developed several years earlier by

differences between our treatment and the resummation method proposed

The usual implement procedure for the reconstruction of secular equation for
an effective Hamiltonian has been discussed and improved. A relative
characteristic polynomial has been introduced for the effective Hamiltonian, to
obtain a simplified effective-secular-equation which is equivalent to the one
obtained in the usual reconstruction procedure but shows great convenience and
effectiveness, especially when the $P$-space dimension is large.

<h3>Effect of symmetries in out-of-time ordered correlators in interacting  integrable and nonintegrable many-body quantum systems</h3>

Out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) help characterize the scrambling of
quantum information and are usually studied in the context of nonintegrable
systems. We compare the relaxation dynamics of OTOCs in interacting integrable
and nonintegrable many-body quantum systems in the presence of U(1) symmetry
and supersymmetry. We show that their dynamics exhibit similar behaviors, with
a time dependence that is mostly determined by the symmetry rather than
integrability, and they follow closely the dynamics of two-point correlators.
We study the OTOCs dynamics using numerical calculations, and gain analytical
insights from the properties of the diagonal and of the off-diagonal matrix
elements of the OTOCs local operators in the energy eigenbasis.

Polyyne, a sp1-hybridized linear allotrope of carbon, has a tunable
quasiparticle energy gap, which depends on the terminated chemical ending
groups as well as the chain length. Previously, nitrogen doping was utilized to
tailor the properties of different kinds of allotrope of carbon. However, how
the nitrogen doping tailors the properties of the polyyne remains unexplored.
Here, we applied the GW method to study the quasiparticle energy gaps of the
N-doped polyynes with different lengths. When a C atom is substituted by a N
atom in a polyyne, the quasiparticle energy gap varies with the substituted
position in the polyyne. The modification is particularly pronounced when the
second-nearest-neighboring carbon atom of a hydrogen atom is substituted. In
addition, the nitrogen doping makes the Fermi level closer to the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital, resulting in a n-type semiconductor. Our results
suggest another route to tailor the electronic properties of polyyne in
addition to the length of polyyne and the terminated chemical ending groups.

We report on the achievement of quantum degeneracy in both components of a
Bose-Fermi mixture of metastable helium atoms, $^4$He* and $^3$He*. Degeneracy
is achieved via Doppler cooling and forced evaporation for $^4$He*, and
sympathetically cooling $^3$He* with $^4$He*. We discuss our simplified
implementation, along with the high versatility of our system. This technique
is able to produce a degenerate Fermi gas with a minimum reduced temperature of
$T/T_F=0.14(1)$, consisting of $2.5 \times 10^4$ $^3$He* atoms. Due to the high
internal energy of both isotopes single atom detection is possible, opening the
possibility of a large number of experiments into Bose-Fermi mixtures.

We investigate the current-phase relations of Al/InAs-quantum well planar
Josephson junctions fabricated using nanowire shadowing technique. Based on
several experiments, we conclude that the junctions exhibit an unusually large
second-order Josephson harmonic, the $\sin(2\varphi)$ term. First,
superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUIDs) show half-periodic
oscillations, tunable by gate voltages as well as magnetic flux. Second,
Josephson junction devices exhibit kinks near half-flux quantum in supercurrent
diffraction patterns. Third, half-integer Shapiro steps are present in the
junctions. Similar phenomena are observed in Sn/InAs quantum well devices. We
perform data fitting to a numerical model with a two-component current phase
relation, however the microscopic origins of the observed effect remain to be
understood. We consider alternative explanations which can account for some but
not all of the evidence.

Voltage-induced dynamic switching in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a
writing technique for voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory
(VCMRAM), which is expected to be an ultimate non-volatile memory with
ultra-low power consumption. In conventional dynamic switching, the width of
sub-nanosecond write voltage pulses must be precisely controlled to achieve a
sufficiently low write-error rate (WER). This very narrow tolerance of pulse
width is the biggest technical difficulty in developing VCMRAM. Heavily damped
precessional switching is a writing scheme for VCMRAM with a substantially high
tolerance of pulse width although the minimum WER has been much higher than
that of conventional dynamic switching with an optimum pulse width. In this
study, we theoretically investigate the effect of MTJ shape and the direction
of the applied magnetic field on the WER of heavily damped precessional
switching. The results show that the WER in elliptical-cylinder MTJ can be
several orders of magnitude smaller than that in usual circular-cylinder MTJ
when the external magnetic field is applied parallel to the minor axis of the
ellipse. The reduction in WER is due to the fact that the demagnetization field
narrows the component of the magnetization distribution perpendicular to the
plane direction immediately before the voltage is applied.

Electron interactions in quantum devices can exhibit intriguing phenomena.
One example is assembling an electronic device in series with an on-chip
resistor. The quantum laws of electricity of the device is modified at low
energies and temperatures by dissipative interactions from the resistor, a
phenomenon known as dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB). The DCB strength is
usually non-adjustable in a fixed environment defined by the resistor. Here, we
design an on-chip circuit for InAs-Al hybrid nanowires where the DCB strength
can be gate-tuned in situ. InAs-Al nanowires could host Andreev or Majorana
zero-energy states. This technique enables tracking the evolution of the same
state while tuning the DCB strength from weak to strong. We observe the
transition from a zero-bias conductance peak to split peaks for Andreev
zero-energy states. Our technique opens the door to in situ tuning interaction
strength on zero-energy states.

We present finite-element numerical algorithms for the identification of
vortices in quantum fluids described by a macroscopic complex wave function.
Their implementation using the free software FreeFem++ is distributed with this
paper as a post-processing toolbox that can be used to analyse numerical or
experimental data. Applications for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and
superfluid helium flows are presented. Programs are tested and validated using
either numerical data obtained by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation or
experimental images of rotating BEC. Vortex positions are computed as
topological defects (zeros) of the wave function when numerical data are used.
For experimental images, we compute vortex positions as local minima of the
atomic density, extracted after a simple image processing. Once vortex centers
are identified, we use a fit with a Gaussian to precisely estimate vortex
radius. For vortex lattices, the lattice parameter (inter-vortex distance) is
also computed. The post-processing toolbox offers a complete description of
vortex configurations in superfluids. Tests for two-dimensional (giant vortex
in rotating BEC, Abrikosov vortex lattice in experimental BEC) and
three-dimensional (vortex rings, Kelvin waves and quantum turbulence fields in
superfluid helium) configurations show the robustness of the software. The
communication with programs providing the numerical or experimental wave
function field is simple and intuitive. The post-processing toolbox can be also
applied for the identification of vortices in superconductors.

using the WIEN2k Package. The mechanical optimization and structural
stabilities were evaluated. The found results are in full agreement with the

rigid structures. The $PbCeO_3$ presents n-type semiconductor while $PbREO_3\;
(RE= Gd,\; Nd)$ exhibit p-type semi-conductor with gap energies of $2.60\;eV$,
$1.02\;eV$ and $1.55\;eV$, respectively. The optical properties show that
$PbREO_3\; (RE=Ce,\; Gd,\; Nd)$ have significant absorption in the visible

The chiral surface states of Weyl semimetals are known for having an open
Fermi surface called Fermi arc. At the interface between two Weyl semimetals,
these Fermi arcs are predicted to potentially deform into unique interface
states. In this letter, we numerically study a one-dimensional (1D) dielectric
trilayer grating where the relative displacements between adjacent layers play
the role of two synthetic momenta. The lattice is described by an effective
Hamiltonian whose spectral properties coincide closely with rigorous
electromagnetic simulations. Our trilayer system is a simple but versatile
platform that emulates 3D crystals without time-reversal symmetry, including
Weyl semimetal, nodal line semimetal, and 3D Chern insulator. It allows us to
not only observe phenomena such as the phase transition between Weyl semimetal
and Chern insulator but also confirm the Fermi arc reconstruction between two
Weyl semimetals.

Harnessing the enhanced light-matter coupling and quantum vacuum fluctuations
resulting from mode volume compression in optical cavities is a promising route
towards functionalizing quantum materials and realizing exotic states of
matter. Here, we extend cavity quantum electrodynamical materials engineering
to correlated magnetic systems, by demonstrating that a Fabry-P\'erot cavity
can be used to control the magnetic state of the proximate quantum spin liquid
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Depending on specific cavity properties such as the mode
frequency, photon occupation, and strength of the light-matter coupling, any of
the magnetic phases supported by the extended Kitaev model can be stabilized.
In particular, in the THz regime, we show that the cavity vacuum fluctuations
alone are sufficient to bring $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ from a zigzag antiferromagnetic
to a ferromagnetic state. By external pumping of the cavity in the few photon
limit, it is further possible to push the system into the antiferromagnetic

Anisotropic colloidal particles exhibit complex dynamics which play a crucial
role in their functionality, transport and phase behaviour. In this work, we
investigate the two-dimensional diffusion of smoothly curved colloidal rods --
also known as colloidal bananas -- as a function of their opening angle,
{\alpha}. We measure the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of
the particles with opening angles ranging from 0{\deg} (straight rods) to
nearly 360{\deg}(closed rings). In particular, we find that the anisotropic
diffusion of the particles varies non-monotonically with their opening angle
and that the axis of fastest diffusion switches from the long to the short axis
of the particles when {\alpha}>180{\deg}.
We also find that the rotational diffusion coefficient of nearly closed rings
is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of straight rods of the
same length. Finally, we show that the experimental results are consistent with
Slender Body Theory, indicating that the dynamical behavior of the particles
arises primarily from their local drag anisotropy. These results highlight the
impact of curvature on the Brownian Motion of elongated colloidal particles,
which must be taken into account when seeking to understand the behaviour of
curved colloidal particles.

Magnetic molecules are investigated with respect to their usability as units
in future quantum devices. In view of quantum computing, a necessary
prerequisite is a long coherence time of superpositions of low-lying levels. In
this article, we investigate by means of numerical simulations whether a
toroidal structure of single-ion easy anisotropy axes is advantageous as often
conjectured. Our results demonstrate that there is no general advantage of
toroidal magnetic molecules, but that arrangements of tilted anisotropy axes
perform best in many cases.

<br>
<br>
For terahertz (THz) wave applications, tunable and rapid modulation is highly
required. When studied by means of optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy,
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) thin films demonstrated ultrafast
carrier recombination lifetimes with a high relative change in the signal under
optical excitation, making them promising candidates for high-speed modulators.
Here, combination of SWCNTthin films and stretchable substrates facilitated
studies of the SWCNT mechanical properties under strain,and enabled the
development of a new type of an opto-mechanical modulator. By applying a
certain strain to the SWCNT films, the effective sheet conductance and
therefore modulation depth can be fine-tuned to optimize the designed
modulator. Modulators exhibited a photoconductivity change of 3-4 orders of
magnitude under the strain due to the structural modification in the SWCNT
network. Stretching was used to control the THz signal with a modulation depth
of around 100 % without strain and 65 % at a high strainoperation of 40 %. The
sensitivity of modulators to beam polarisation is also shown, which might also
come in handy for the design of a stretchable polariser. Our results give a
fundamental grounding for the design of high-sensitivity stretchable devices
based on SWCNT films.

We investigate knotting probabilities of long double-stranded DNA strands in
a coarse-grained Kratky-Porod model for DNA with Monte Carlo simulations.
Various ionic conditions are implemented by adjusting the effective diameter of
monomers. We find that the occurrence of knots in DNA can be reinforced
considerably by high salt conditions and confinement between plates. Likewise,
knots can almost be dissolved completely in a low salt scenario. Comparisons
with recent experiments confirm that the coarse-grained model is able to
capture and quantitatively predict topological features of DNA and can be used
for guiding future experiments on DNA knots.

Pairing of composite fermions provides a possible mechanism for fractional
quantum Hall effect at even denominator fractions and is believed to serve as a
platform for realizing quasiparticles with non-Abelian braiding statistics. We
present results from fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo calculations which
predict that substantial Landau level mixing can induce a pairing of composite
fermions at filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $\nu=1/4$ in the $l=-3$ relative
angular momentum channel, thereby destabilizing the composite-fermion Fermi
seas to produce non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states.

We study the long-time asymptotic behavior of the position distribution of a
run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in two dimensions and show that the distribution
at a time $t$ can be expressed as a perturbative series in $(\gamma t)^{-1}$,
where $\gamma^{-1}$ is the persistence time of the RTP. We show that the higher
order corrections to the leading order Gaussian distribution generically
satisfy an inhomogeneous diffusion equation where the source term depends on
the previous order solutions. The explicit solution of the inhomogeneous
equation requires the position moments, and we develop a recursive formalism to
compute the same.

<h3>Coupling Navier-Stokes and Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the numerical  simulation of two-fluid quantum flows</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07361" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07361</a>

Numerical methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations for classical (or
normal) viscous fluids are well established. This is also the case for the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, governing quantum inviscid flows (or superfluids) in
the zero temperature limit. In quantum flows, like liquid helium II at
intermediate temperatures between zero and 2.17 K, a normal fluid and a
superfluid coexist with independent velocity fields. The most advanced existing
models for such systems use the Navier-Stokes equations for the normal fluid
and a simplified description of the superfluid, based on the dynamics of
quantized vortex filaments, with ad hoc reconnection rules. There was a single
attempt (C. Coste, The European Physical Journal B - Condensed Matter and
Complex Systems, 1998) to couple Navier-Stokes and Gross-Pitaevskii equations
in a global model intended to describe the compressible two-fluid liquid helium
II. We present in this contribution a new numerical model to couple a
Navier-Stokes incompressible fluid with a Gross-Pitaevskii superfluid. Coupling
terms in the global system of equations involve new definitions of the
following concepts: the regularized superfluid vorticity and velocity fields,
the friction force exerted by quantized vortices to the normal fluid, the
covariant gradient operator in the Gross-Pitaevskii based on a slip velocity
respecting the dynamics of vortex lines in the normal fluid. A numerical
algorithm based on pseudo-spectral Fourier methods is presented for solving the
coupled system of equations.Finally, we numerically test and validate the new
numerical system against well-known benchmarks for the evolution in a normal
fluid of different types or arrangements of quantized vortices (vortex crystal,
vortex dipole and vortex rings). The new coupling model opens new possibilities
to revisit and enrich existing numerical results for complex quantum fluids.

<h3>Generalization of interlayer tunneling models to cuprate superconductors  with charge density waves</h3>

<br>
<i>Hércules Santana, E. V. L. de Mello</i>
<br>
<br>
At the beginning of cuprate superconductors, the interlayer tunneling (ILT)
and Lawrence-Doniach (L-D) models, which connect the CuO planes by Josephson
coupling were considered the leading theoretical proposals for these materials.
However, measurements of the interlayer magnetic penetration depth
$\lambda_{c}$ yielded larger values than required by the ILT model. After the
discovery of planar stripes and incommensurate charge ordering, it was also
possible to consider Josephson coupling between these mesoscopic charge domains
or blocks. We show that the average intralayer is larger than the interlayer
coupling and comparable with the condensation energy, leading to a
superconducting transition by long-range phase order. Another consequence is
that the ratio $[\lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab}]^2$ is directly proportional
resistivity ratio $\rho_c/ \rho_{ab}$ near the superconducting transition
temperature in agreement with several measurements.

<h3>Magnetic frustration and fractionalization in oligo(indenoindenes)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Poly(indenoindenes) are {\pi}-conjugated ladder carbon polymers with
alternating hexagons and pentagons hosting one unpaired electron for each
five-membered ring in the open-shell limit. Here we study the main magnetic
interactions that are present in finite oligo(indenoindenes) (OInIn),
classifying the six possible isomers in two different classes of three isomers
each. One class can be rationalized by frustrated S = 1/2 Heisenberg chains,
with ferromagnetic interactions between neighbour sites and antiferromagnetic
interactions between the next neighbours. The other class is characterized by
the more trivial antiferromagnetic order. Employing several levels of theory we
further show that the ground state of one of the isomers is a valence-bond
solid (VBS) of ferromagnetic dimers (S = 1). This is topologically similar to
that of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is known to show
fractional S = 1/2 states at the edges.

The Chapman-Enskog method, in combination with the quantum maximum entropy
principle, is applied to the Wigner equation in order to obtain quantum
Navier-Stokes equations for electrons in graphene in the isothermal case. The
derivation is based on the quantum version of the maximum entropy principle and
follows the lines of Ringhofer-Degond-M\'ehats' theory (J. Stat. Phys. 112,
2003 and Z. Angew. Math. Mech. 90, 2010). The model obtained in this way is
then semiclassically expanded up to $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$.

<h3>Differential Equation of Thermal Equilibrium, Quantum Conditions, and  Relation between Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein Distributions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Boltzmann distribution is commonly interpreted as a classical
approximation of the quantum-mechanical Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein
distributions. We arrive at a different conclusion by directly investigating
the three equilibrium distributions without considering statistical variations.
A general differential equation of thermal equilibrium is obtained that applies
to any particles. Simple integration yields the Boltzmann distribution.
Furthermore, quantum conditions are established, ruling the occupation numbers
of (i) fermions by utilizing Pauli's exclusion principle and (ii) bosons by
utilizing Einstein's rate-equation approach to Planck's law of blackbody
radiation. By exploiting the respective quantum condition, integration of the
same differential equation of thermal equilibrium yields either the Fermi-Dirac
or the Bose-Einstein distribution. It suggests that the Boltzmann distribution
is a general distribution of thermal equilibrium, whereas the Fermi-Dirac and
Bose-Einstein distributions are special cases of the Boltzmann distribution,
ruled by specific conditions. This suggestion is further underlined by the fact
that inserting the respective quantum condition directly into the Boltzmann
distribution delivers either the Fermi-Dirac or the Bose-Einstein distribution.
This finding implies that fermions and bosons simultaneously obey both their
own specific and the general Boltzmann distribution.

<h3>Orbital Fulde-Ferrell pairing state in moiré Ising superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we study superconducting moir\'e homobilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides in which the Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is much larger
than the moir\'e bandwidth. We call such noncentrosymmetric superconductors,
moir\'e Ising superconductors. Due to the large Ising SOC, the depairing effect
caused by the Zeeman field is negligible and the in-plane upper critical field
($B_{c2}$) is determined by the orbital effects. This allows the study the
orbital effect of exceedingly large magnetic fields (much larger than the Pauli
limit). Interestingly, when the applied in-plane field is larger than the
conventional orbital $B_{c2}$ of zero momentum pairing states, a finite
momentum pairing phase appears which we call the orbital Fulde-Ferrell (FF)
state. In this state, the Cooper pairs acquire a net momentum of $2q_B$ where
$2q_B=eBd$ is the momentum shift caused by the magnetic field $B$ and $d$
denotes the layer separation. This orbital-field-driven FF state is different
from the conventional FF state driven by Zeeman effects in Rashba
superconductors. Remarkably, we predict that the FF pairing would result in a
giant superconducting diode effect under electric gating. An upturn of the
$B_{c2}$ as the temperature lowers and the giant superconducting diode effect
allows the detection of this new orbital FF state.

Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a novel phenomenon appearing in
non-Hermitian systems. Here, we report the experimental observation of NHSE.
Different from the previous non-reciprocal circuit implementation scheme using
logic components, we construct our one-dimensional (1D) circuits using linear
components only. Besides, we achieve the non-reciprocity by proportionally
varying the parameter value of the components. By measuring the voltage
response of each site, the information of eigenstates can be mapped out. The
results show that the voltage response is always larger on one end of the
circuit no matter on which end voltage driving is applied, indicating clearly
the presence of the NHSE. Furthermore, we also simulate the interplay of NHSE
and Anderson localization (AL) when additional disorder is introduced. Upon
increasing the disorder strength, we observe the transformation from the skin
effect phase to the localized phase. In the regime of skin effect phase, the
eigenstates are all localized at one edge while eigenstates are affected by the
voltage supply input in localized phase. Our findings unveil a possible new
route for simulation of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.

Noble metals break preferably exposing (111)-oriented surfaces, that host
Shockley type surface states (SSs). Nevertheless, the relevance of SSs on the
electrical properties of gold-based molecular junctions has not been explored
in detail yet. Here, we present ab initio simulations that show how the gold
(111) SS, that lies approximately 0.5 eV below the Fermi energy, is key to
determining correctly the electrical and thermoelectric response of the above
junctions. We show how the ability to shift in a controlled way the energy
position of gold SS enables us to tune the electrical and thermoelectric
response of gold molecular junctions. We also show that gold's SS appears in
our simulations only if the 5d orbitals are included explicitly in the valence
shell. To illustrate this behaviour, we discuss in detail Benzenediamine (BDA)
and Benzenedicarbonitrile (BDCN) gold (111) junctions.

<br>
Long viewed as passive elements, antiferromagnetic materials have emerged as
promising candidates for spintronic devices due to their insensitivity to
external fields and potential for high-speed switching. Recent work exploiting
spin and orbital effects has identified ways to electrically control and probe
the spins in metallic antiferromagnets, especially in noncollinear or
noncentrosymmetric spin structures. The rare earth nickelate NdNiO3 is known to
be a noncollinear antiferromagnet where the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering
is concomitant with a transition to an insulating state. Here, we find that for
low electron doping, the magnetic order on the nickel site is preserved while
electronically a new metallic phase is induced. We show that this metallic
phase has a Fermi surface that is mostly gapped by an electronic reconstruction
driven by the bond disproportionation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability
to write to and read from the spin structure via a large zero-field planar Hall
effect. Our results expand the already rich phase diagram of the rare-earth
nickelates and may enable spintronics applications in this family of correlated
oxides.

The aim of this thesis is to compare the capacity of different models of

perceptron using a simple combinatorial argument. After some observations on
the storage capacity of a basic network, known as an associative memory, we
introduce a powerful statistical mechanical approach to calculate its capacity
in the training rule-dependent Hopfield model. With the aim of finding a more
general definition that can be applied even to quantum neural nets, we then
follow Gardner's work, which let us get rid of the dependency on the training
rule, and comment the results obtained by Lewenstein et al. by applying
Gardner's methods on a recently proposed quantum perceptron model.

We model nematic liquid crystal configurations inside three-dimensional
prisms, with a polygonal cross-section and Dirichlet boundary conditions on all
prism surfaces. We work in a reduced Landau-de Gennes framework, and the
Dirichlet conditions on the top and bottom surfaces are special in the sense,
that they are critical points of the reduced Landau-de Gennes energy on the
polygonal cross-section. The choice of the boundary conditions allows us to
make a direct correspondence between the three-dimensional Landau-de Gennes
critical points and pathways on the two-dimensional Landau-de Gennes solution
landscape on the polygonal cross-section. We explore this concept by means of
asymptotic analysis and numerical examples, with emphasis on a cuboid and a
hexagonal prism, focusing on three-dimensional multistability tailored by
two-dimensional solution landscapes.

<br>
<br>
Due to the slow dynamics of the wetting ridge, it is challenging to predict
the wetting morphology of liquid drops on thin lubricant coated surfaces. It is
hypothesized that when a drop sinks on a lubricated surface, quasi-static
wetting morphology can be numerically computed only from the knowledge of
interfacial energies, lubricant thickness, and drop volume. We used Surface
Evolver software for the numerical computation of the interface profiles for a
four-phase system. For the experiments, we used drops of 80 wt% formamide on
silicone oil coated substrates with varying lubricant thickness, substrate
wettability and drop volume. Optical images of drops were used to compare the
experimental interfacial profiles and apparent contact angles with the
numerically computed ones. We found good agreement between the experiments and
the simulations for the interfacial profiles and apparent contact angles as a
function of various systems parameters except for very thin lubricating films.
Apparent contact angles varied non-linearly as a function of substrate
wettability and lubricant thickness, however, were found constant with the drop
volume.

Low-frequency vibrational harmonic modes of glasses are frequently used to
understand their universal low-temperature properties. One well studied feature
is the excess low-frequency density of states over the Debye model prediction.
Here we examine the system size dependence of the density of states for
two-dimensional glasses. For systems of fewer than 100 particles, the density
of states scales with the system size as if all the modes were plane-wave-like.
However, for systems greater than 100 particles we find a different system-size
scaling of the cumulative density of states below the first transverse sound
mode frequency, which can be derived from the assumption that these modes are
quasi-localized. Moreover, for systems greater than 100 particles, we find that
the cumulative density of states scales with frequency as a power law with the
exponent that leads to the exponent $\beta=3.5$ for the density of states
independent of system size.

In this paper, we investigate the influence of the rare earth element (R) on
the physical properties of RVO3 (R = Er, Ho, Y, Lu). For this purpose, a
theoretical work is reported in this study using ab initio method with the
intent of enhancing our knowledge of the electronic, and magnetic properties of
RVO3 (R = Er, Ho, Y, Lu) compounds. The electronic properties of these
materials show the presence of Jahn-Teller effect, with a band gap of
approximately 0.58eV, 1.57eV, 1.12eV, 1.28eV, for ErVO3, HoVO3, YVO3, LuVO3,
respectively. The magnetic contribution of Ho, Er, and V atoms in HoVO3, and
ErVO3 compounds was disentangled using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD). The magnetic anisotropies of RVO3 with (R = Er, Ho, Y, Lu) are studied
and analyzed using spin orbit coupling. We noticed an easy axis of
magnetization along the c-direction with strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy
energies for the non-magnetic rare earth elements (R = Lu, Y)VO3. For the
magnetic rare earth elements, the easy and hard magnetization direction were
found to be along b-axis and c-axis, and a- axis and c-axis for HoVO3, and
ErVO3, respectively. This means that instead of the standard magnetization
demagnetization process, large thermal effects can be obtained by spinning
their single crystals in constant magnetic fields. The exchange coupling
between (Ho-V) is also found to be greater than the other exchange interactions
in HoVO3. Accordingly, a large conventional magnetocaloric effect could be
created in HoVO3, since the Ho Ising moments experience a metamagnetic
transition. However, the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is expected to be lower in
ErVO3 due to the weak (Er-V) exchange coupling.

Research in spintronics often involves generation of heat in nanoscale
magnetic systems. This heat generation can be intentional, as when studying
effects created by an external applied temperature difference, or
unintentional, coming as a consequence of driving relatively large charge
currents through tiny structures. Understanding and controlling these thermal
gradients can present challenges to experimentalists, which are related at some
level to the fact that heat flow is much more difficult to isolate and
manipulate than charge flow. This paper aims to provide a simple, intuitive
framework to understand the fundamental issues that arise in spintronic
materials and devices involving thermal gradients. The first goal is to provide
simple tools to demonstrate how thermal gradients arise in systems with thin
conducting films on bulk substrates. The main results are that a thermal
gradient pointing perpendicular to the plane of a thin film supported on a
macroscopic substrate is very common, even while the largest temperature drop
in the system will exist across the bulk substrate itself. These results point
to the need to understand the range of thermoelectric and magnetothermoelectric
effects that can generate voltage signals and other responses to thermal
gradients. I provide a brief review of these, along with relevant spin effects.
The review concludes with examples and comments on several important ongoing
issues in spintronics where thermal gradients play key roles.

The viscosity of lead-containing glasses is of fundamental importance for the
manufacturing process, and can be predicted by algorithms such as artificial
neural networks. The SciGlass database was used to provide training, validation
and test data of chemical composition, temperature and viscosity for the
construction of artificial neural networks with node variation in the hidden
layer. The best model built with training data and validation data was compared
with 7 other models from the literature, demonstrating better statistical
evaluations of mean absolute error and coefficient of determination to the test
data, with subsequent sensitivity analysis in agreement with the literature.
Skewness and kurtosis were calculated and there is a good correlation between
the values predicted by the best neural network built with the test data.

This work identifies a solvable, rotationally invariant random matrix
ensemble with a logarithmic confining potential. The ensemble, which can be
interpreted as a transformed Jacobi ensemble, is in the thermodynamic limit
characterized by a Lorentzian eigenvalue density. It is shown that spectral
correlation functions can be expressed in terms of Gegenbauer polynomials
$C_n^{(\lambda)}(x)$ with $\lambda = -1/2$ and $n \ge 2$. A procedure to sample
matrices from the ensemble is outlined and used to provide a numerical
verification for some of the analytical results. This newly proposed ensemble

Organic metal halide hybrids with low-dimensional structures at the molecular
level have received great attention recently for their exceptional structural
tunability and unique photophysical properties. Here we report for the first
time the synthesis and characterization of a one-dimensional (1D) organic metal
halide hybrid material, which contains metal halide nanoribbons with a width of
three octahedral units. It is found that this material with a chemical formula
C$_8$H$_{28}$N$_5$Pb$_3$Cl$_{11}$ shows a dual emission with a
photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of around 25% under ultraviolet
(UV) light irradiation. Photophysical studies and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations suggest the coexisting of delocalized free excitons and
localized self-trapped excitons in metal halide nanoribbons leading to the dual
emission. This work shows once again the exceptional tunability of organic
metal halide hybrids that bridge between molecular systems with localized
states and crystalline ones with electronic bands.

An open question in mechanics is whether mechanical resonators can be made
nonlinear with vibrations approaching the quantum ground state. This requires
engineering a mechanical nonlinearity far beyond what has been realized thus
far. Here we discovered a mechanism to boost the Duffing nonlinearity by
coupling the vibrations of a nanotube resonator to single-electron tunneling
and by operating the system in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Remarkably,
thermal vibrations become highly nonlinear when lowering the temperature. The
average vibration amplitude at the lowest temperature is 13 times the
zero-point motion, with approximately 42% of the thermal energy stored in the
anharmonic part of the potential. Our work paves the way for realizing
mechanical Schrodinger cat states [1], mechanical qubits [2, 3], and quantum
simulators emulating the electron-phonon coupling [4].
