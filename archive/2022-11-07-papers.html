<h3>Synchrotron Radiation Techniques and their Application to Actinide  Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02704" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02704</a>

Research on actinide materials, both basic and applied, has been greatly
advanced by the general techniques available from high-intensity photon beams
from x-ray synchrotron sources. The most important single reason is that such
x-ray sources can work with minute (e.g., microgram) samples, and at this
level, the radioactive hazards of actinides are much reduced. We start by
discussing the form and encapsulation procedures used for different techniques,
then discuss the basic theory for interpreting the results. By reviewing a
selection of x-ray diffraction (XRD), resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS),
x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), resonant and non-resonant inelastic
scattering (RIXS, NIXS), dispersive inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), and
conventional and resonant photoemission experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of synchrotron radiation techniques in studying lattice and
electronic structure, hybridization effects, multipolar order, and lattice
dynamics in actinide materials.

<h3>Hydrodynamic Coupling Melts Acoustically Levitated Crystalline Rafts</h3>

The acoustic levitation of small particles provides a versatile platform to
investigate the collective dynamical properties of self-assembled many-body
systems in the presence of hydrodynamic coupling. However, acoustic scattering
forces can only generate attractive interactions at close range in the
levitation plane, limiting self-assembly to rafts where particles come into
direct, dissipative, contact. Here, we overcome this limitation by using
particles small enough that the viscosity of air establishes a repulsive
streaming flow at close range. By tuning the size of particles relative to the
characteristic length scale of the viscous flow, we control the interplay
between attractive and repulsive forces. In this novel granular raft, particles
form an open lattice with tunable spacing. Hydrodynamic coupling between
particles gives rise to spontaneous excitations in the lattice, in turn driving
intermittent particle rearrangements. Under the action of these fluctuations,
the raft transitions from a predominantly quiescent, crystalline structure, to
a two-dimensional liquid-like state. We show that this transition is
characterized by dynamic heterogeneity and intermittency, as well as
cooperative particle movements, that produce an effectively `cageless' crystal.
These findings shed light on fluid-coupling driven excitations that are
difficult to isolate and control in many other hydrodynamic systems.

<h3>A route for the top-down fabrication of ordered ultrathin GaN nanowires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03204" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03204</a>

<br>
<br>
Ultrathin GaN nanowires (NWs) are attractive to maximize surface effects and
as building block in high-frequency transistors. Here, we introduce a facile
route for the top-down fabrication of ordered arrays of GaN NWs with aspect
ratios exceeding $10$ and diameters below $20\,$nm. Highly uniform thin GaN NWs
are first obtained by using electron beam lithography to pattern a Ni/SiN$_x$
hard mask, followed by dry etching and wet etching in hot KOH. The SiN$_x$ is
found to work as an etch stop during wet etching in hot KOH. Arrays with NW
diameters down to $(33 \pm5)\,$nm can be achieved with a yield exceeding
$99.9\,\%$. Further reduction of the NW diameter down to $5\,$nm is obtained by
applying digital etching which consists in plasma oxidation followed by wet
etching in hot KOH. The NW radial etching depth is tuned by varying the RF
power during plasma oxidation. NW breaking or bundling is observed for
diameters below $\approx 20\,$nm, an effect that is associated to capillary
forces acting on the NWs during sample drying in air. This effect can be
principally mitigated using critical point dryers. Interestingly, this
mechanical instability of the NWs is found to occur at much smaller aspect
ratios than what is predicted for models dealing with macroscopic elastic rods.
Explicit calculations of buckling states show an improved agreement when
considering an inclined water surface, as can be expected if water assembles
into droplets. The proposed fabrication route can be principally applied to any
GaN/SiN$_{x}$ nanostructures and allows regrowth after removal of the SiN$_{x}$
mask.

<h3>Two-dimensional single-valley exciton qubit and optical spin  magnetization generation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03334" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03334</a>

Creating and manipulating coherent qubit states are actively pursued in
two-dimensional (2D) materials research. Significant efforts have been made
towards the realization of two-valley exciton qubits in monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), based on states from their two
distinct valleys in k-space. Here, we propose a new scheme to create qubits in
2D materials utilizing a novel kind of degenerate exciton states in a single
valley. Combining group theoretic analysis and ab initio GW plus Bethe-Salpeter
equation (GW-BSE) calculations, we demonstrate such novel qubit states in
substrate-supported monolayer bismuthene -- which has been successfully grown
using molecular beam epitaxy. In each of the two distinct valleys in the
Brillouin zone, strong spin-orbit coupling along with $C_{3v}$ symmetry leads
to a pair of degenerate 1s exciton states with opposite spin configurations.
Specific coherent linear combinations of the two degenerate excitons in a
single valley can be excited with specific light polarizations, enabling full
manipulation of the exciton qubits and their spin configurations. In
particular, a net spin magnetization can be generated. Our finding opens new
routes to create and manipulate qubit systems in 2D materials.

<h3>Anticipating Collisions, Navigating in Complex Environments, Elbowing,  Pushing, and Smartphone-Walking: A Versatile Agent-Based Model for Pedestrian  Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03419</a>
<br>
<i>Iñaki Echeverría-Huarte, Alexandre Nicolas</i>
<br>
<br>
Compared to other self-propelled particles, pedestrians are able to
anticipate, which gives them an edge in avoiding collisions and navigating in
cluttered spaces. These capabilities are impaired by digital distraction
through smartphones, a growing safety concern. To capture these features, we
put forward a continuous agent-based model hinging on a transparent delineation
of a decisionmaking process and a mechanical layer that handles contacts and
collisions. In the decisional layer, each agent autonomously selects their
desired velocity as the optimum of a perceived cost, notably balancing the will
to move forward (described by a floor field) with the bio-mechanical cost of
walking and the risk of collision, assessed by an anticipated
time-to-collision. Altogether, the model includes less than a dozen parameters,
most of which are fit using independent experimental data. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the versatility of the approach, which succeeds in
reproducing empirical observations in extremely diverse scenarios, often
quantitatively, with a single set of parameters. These scenarios range from
collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents to collective flow
properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings and to the dynamics of
evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible.
Remarkably, a straightforward transcription of digital distraction into the
model, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, suffices to replicate
the enhanced chaoticity of the flow, with more frequent sudden turns, observed
experimentally when 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians are brought in. Finally,
the conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin
of some deficiencies, notably its shortsighted account of anticipation (when
agents have to cross a group of people) and the disk-like pedestrian shape
(when very dense crowds are considered). Our work thus clarifies the singular
position of pedestrian crowds in the midst of active-matter systems.

<h3>Kinetic description of ion transport in the system "ionic solution --  porous environment"</h3>

A kinetic approach based on a modified chain of BBGKI equations for
nonequilibrium particle distribution functions was used to describe the ion
transfer processes in the ionic solution -- porous medium system. A generalized
kinetic equation of the revised Enskog--Vlasov--Landau theory for the
nonequilibrium ion distribution function in the model of charged solid spheres
is obtained, taking into account attractive short-range interactions for the
ionic solution -- porous medium system.

<h3>Hydrodynamic relaxation of spin helices</h3>

<i>Guillaume Cecile, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur, Jacopo De Nardis</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent cold atom experiments, we study the relaxation of spin
helices in quantum XXZ spin chains. The experimentally observed relaxation of
spin helices follows scaling laws that are qualitatively different from
linear-response transport. We construct a theory of the relaxation of helices,
combining generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) with diffusive corrections and the
local density approximation. Although helices are far from local equilibrium
(so GHD need not apply a priori), our theory reproduces the experimentally
observed relaxational dynamics of helices. In particular, our theory explains
the existence of temporal regimes with apparent anomalous diffusion, as well as
the asymmetry between positive and negative anisotropy regimes.

<h3>Energy Localization Efficiency in TATB Pore Collapse Mechanisms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03748" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03748</a>
<br>
<i>Brenden W. Hamilton, Timothy C. Germann</i>
<br>
<br>
Atomistic and continuum scale modeling efforts have shown that shock induced
collapse of porosity can occur via a wide range of mechanisms dependent on pore
morphology, shockwave pressure, and material properties. The mechanisms that
occur under weaker shocks tend to be more efficient at localizing thermal
energy, but do not result in high, absolute temperatures or spatially large
localizations compared to mechanisms found under strong shock conditions.
However, the energetic material TATB undergoes a wide range of collapse
mechanisms that are not typical of similar materials, leaving the collapse
mechanisms and the resultant energy localization from collapse, i.e., hotspots,
relatively uncharacterized. Therefore, we present pore collapse simulations of
cylindrical pores in TATB for a wide range of pore sizes and shock strengths
that trigger viscoplastic collapses that occur almost entirely perpendicular to
the shock direction for weak shocks and hydrodynamic-like collapses for strong
shocks that do not break the strong hydrogen bonds of the TATB basal planes.
The resulting hotspot temperature fields from these mechanisms follow trends
that differ considerably from other energetic materials; hence we compare them
under normalized temperature values to assess the relative efficiency of each
mechanism to localize energy. The local intra-molecular strain energy of the
hotspots is also assessed to better understand the physical mechanisms behind
the phenomena that leads to a latent potential energy.

<h3>Interplay of superconductivity and localization near a 2D ferromagnetic  quantum critical point</h3>

We study the superconducting instability of a two-dimensional disordered
Fermi liquid weakly coupled to the soft fluctuations associated with proximity
to an Ising-ferromagnetic quantum critical point. We derive interaction-induced
corrections to the Usadel equation governing the superconducting gap function,
and show that diffusion and localization effects drastically modify the
interplay between fermionic incoherence and strong pairing interactions. In
particular, we obtain the phase diagram, and demonstrate that: (i) there is an
intermediate range of disorder strength where superconductivity is enhanced,
eventually followed by a tendency towards the superconductor-insulator
transition at stronger disorder; and (ii) diffusive particle-particle modes
(so-called `Cooperons') acquire anomalous dynamical scaling $z=4$, indicating
strong non-Fermi liquid behaviour.

<h3>Kekulé spiral order in magic-angle graphene: a density matrix  renormalization group study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02693</a>

<br>
<br>
When the two layers of a twisted moir\'e system are subject to different
degrees of strain, the effect is amplified by the inverse twist angle, e.g., by
a factor of 50 in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Samples of TBG
typically have heterostrains of 0.1-0.7%, increasing the bandwidth of the
"flat'' bands by as much as tenfold, placing TBG in an intermediate coupling
regime. Here we study the phase diagram of TBG in the presence of heterostrain
with unbiased, large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations
(bond dimension $\chi=24576$), including all spin and valley degrees of
freedom. Working at filling $\nu = -3$, we find a strain of $0.05\%$ drives a
transition from a quantized anomalous Hall insulator into an
incommensurate-Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) phase. This peculiar order, proposed and
studied at mean-field level by Kwan et al (PRX 11, 041063), breaks both valley
conservation and translation symmetry $\hat{T}$, but preserves a modified
translation symmetry $\hat{T}'$ with moir\'e-incommensurate phase modulation.
Even higher strains drive the system to a fully symmetric metal.

<h3>Wetting and nonwetting near a tricritical point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02697</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph O. Indekeu, Kenichiro Koga</i>
<br>
<br>
The dihedral contact angles between interfaces in three-fluid-phase
equilibria must be continuous functions of the bulk thermodynamic fields. This
general argument, which we propose, predicts a nonwetting gap in the phase
diagram, challenging the common belief in "critical-point wetting", even for
short-range forces. A demonstration is provided by exact solution of a
mean-field two-density functional theory for three-phase equilibria near a
tricritical point (TCP). Complete wetting is found in a tiny vicinity of the
TCP. Away from it, nonwetting prevails and no wetting transition takes place,
not even when a critical endpoint is approached. Far from the TCP, reentrant
wetting may occur, with a different wetting phase. These findings shed light on
hitherto unexplained experiments on ternary water-oil-nonionic amphiphile
mixtures in which nonwetting continues to exist as one approaches either one of
the two critical endpoints.

<h3>Spin polarization of exciton-polariton condensate in a photonic  synthetic effective magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the spin polarization of localized exciton-polariton
condensates. We demonstrate the presence of an effective magnetic field leading
to the formation of elliptically polarized condensates. We show that this
synthetic field has an entirely photonic origin, which we believe is unique for
the CdTe-based microcavities. Moreover, the degree of spin polarization of
localized polariton condensates in samples with magnetic ions depends on the
excitation power or polarization of the non-resonant excitation laser. In an
external magnetic field, the semimagnetic condensate spontaneously builds up
strong spin polarization. Based on the magnetic field behavior of the
condensate in the presence of magnetic ions, we apply a model that allows us to
estimate the polariton-polariton interaction strength in a CdTe-system to
approx. 0.8 $\mu \text{eV}\!\cdot\!\mu \text{m}^2$.

<h3>Non-Additive Interactions Unlock Small-Particle Mobility in Binary  Colloidal Monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02731" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02731</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan G. Raybin, Rebecca B. Wai, Naomi S. Ginsberg</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the organization and dynamics of binary colloidal monolayers
composed of micron-scale silica particles interspersed with smaller-diameter
silica particles that serve as minority component impurities. These binary
monolayers are prepared at the surface of ionic liquid droplets over a range of
size ratios ($\sigma=0.16-0.66$) and are studied with low-dose minimally
perturbative scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The high resolution of SEM
imaging provides direct tracking of all particle coordinates over time,
enabling a complete description of the microscopic state. In these bidisperse
size mixtures, particle interactions are non-additive because interfacial
pinning to the droplet surface causes the equators of differently sized
particles to lie in separate planes. By varying the size ratio we control the
extent of non-additivity in order to achieve phase behavior inaccessible to
strictly 2D systems. Across the range of size ratios we tune the system from a
mobile small-particle phase ($\sigma<0.24$), to an interstitial solid
($0.24<\sigma<0.33$), to a disordered glass ($\sigma>0.33$). These distinct
phase regimes are classified through measurements of hexagonal ordering of the
large-particle host lattice and the lattice's capacity for small-particle
transport. Altogether, we explain these structural and dynamic trends by
considering the combined influence of interparticle interactions and the
colloidal packing geometry. Our measurements are reproduced in molecular
dynamics simulations of 2D non-additive hard disks, suggesting an efficient
method for describing confined systems with reduced dimensionality
representations.

<h3>Ferroelectric Switching Pathways and Domain Structure of  SrBi$_2$(Ta,Nb)$_2$O$_9$ from First Principles</h3>

Several families of layered perovskite oxide ferroelectrics exhibit a
coupling between polarization and structural order parameters, such as
octahedral rotation distortions. This coupling provides opportunities for novel
electric field-based manipulation of material properties, and also stabilizes
complex domain patterns and domain wall vortices. Amongst layered perovskites
with such coupled orders, the Aurivillius-phase oxides SrBi$_2B_2$O$_9$
($B$=Ta, Nb) are well-known for their excellent room temperature ferroelectric
performance. This work combines group theoretic analysis with density
functional theory calculations to examine the ferroelectric switching processes
of SrBi$_2B_2$O$_9$. Low-energy two-step ferroelectric switching paths are
identified, with polarization reversal facilitated by structural order
parameter rotations. Analysis of the domain structure reveals how the relative
energetics of the coupled order parameters translates into a network of several
distinct domain wall types linked by domain wall vortex structures. Comparisons
are made between the ferroelectric switching and domain structure of
SrBi$_2B_2$O$_9$ and those of the layered $n$=2 Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid
improper ferroelectrics. The results provide new insight into how ferroelectric
properties may be optimized by engineering the complex crystal structures of
Aurivllius-phase oxides.

<h3>Detrimental effects of disorder in two-dimensional time-reversal  invariant topological superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02745</a>

<br>
<br>
The robustness against local perturbations, as long as the symmetry of the
system is preserved, is a distinctive feature of topological quantum states.
Magnetic impurities and defects break time-reversal invariance and,
consequently, time-reversal invariant (TRI) topological superconductors are
fragile against this type of disorder. Non-magnetic impurities, however,
preserve time-reversal symmetry and one naively expects a TRI topological
superconductor to persist in the presence of non-magnetic impurities. In this
work, we study the effect of non-magnetic disorder on a TRI topological
superconductor with extended $s$-wave pairing, which can be engineered at the
interface of an Fe-based superconductor and a strongly spin-orbit coupled
Rashba layer. We model two different types of non-magnetic random disorder and
analyze both the bulk density of states and edge state spectrum. Contrary to
naive expectations, we find that the disorder strongly affects the topological
phase by closing the energy gap, while trivial superconducting phases remain
stable and fully gapped. The disorder phase diagram reveals a strong expansion
of a nodal phase with increasing disorder. We further show the decay of the
helical Majorana edge states in the topological phase and how they eventually
disappear with increasing disorder. These results alter our understanding of
effects of impurities and disorder on TRI topological phases and may help
explain the difficulty of experimental observation of TRI topological
superconductors.

<h3>Dynamics of self-dual kagome metamaterials and the emergence of fragile  topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02746" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02746</a>
<br>
<i>Pegah Azizi, Siddhartha Sarkar, Kai Sun, Stefano Gonella</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent years have seen the discovery of systems featuring fragile topological
states. These states of matter lack certain protection attributes typically
associated with topology and are therefore characterized by weaker signatures
that make them elusive to observe. Moreover, they are typically confined to
special symmetry classes and, in general, rarely studied in the context of
phononic media. In this article, we theoretically predict the emergence of
fragile topological bands in the spectrum of a twisted kagome elastic lattice
with three-fold rotational symmetry, in the so-called self-dual configuration.
A necessary requirement is that the lattice is a structural metamaterial, in
which the role of the hinges is played by elastic finite-thickness ligaments.
The interplay between the edge modes appearing in the bandgaps bounding the
fragile topological states is also responsible for the emergence of corner
modes at selected corners of a finite hexagonal domain, which qualifies the
lattice as a second-order topological insulator. We demonstrate our findings
through a series of experiments via 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry
conducted on a physical prototype. The selected configuration stands out for
its remarkable geometric simplicity and ease of physical implementation in the
panorama of dynamical systems exhibiting fragile topology.

We investigate the ground states of spin-$S$ Kitaev ladders using exact
analytical solutions (for $S = 1/2$), perturbation theory, and the density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We find an even-odd effect: in the
case of half-integer $S$, we find phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB) and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order; for integer $S$, we find
SSB and trivial paramagnetic phases. We also study the transitions between the
various phases; notably, for half-integer $S$ we find a transition between two
distinct SPT orders, and for integer $S$ we find unnecessary first order phase
transitions within a trivial phase

<br>
<br>
Time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) enables a unique
spectroscopic view on complex spin and charge dynamics in multi-elemental
magnetic materials. So far, its application in the soft-x-ray range has been
limited to synchrotron-radiation sources and free-electron lasers. By combining
a laser-driven plasma source with a magnetic thin-film polarizer, we generate
circularly polarized photons in the soft x-ray regime, enabling the first XMCD
spectroscopy at the Fe L edges in a laser laboratory. Our approach can be
readily adapted to other transition metal L and rare earth M absorption edges
and with a temporal resolution of < 10 ps, a wide range of ultrafast
magnetization studies can be realized.

attention to predicting new two-dimensional (2D) materials that can be realized
experimentally. As a consequence, first-principles studies of novel 2D
materials become a routine, with thousands of papers published every year. What
makes these studies interesting is that they predict new materials which have
not been realized yet but should be a panacea for topological insulators,
next-generation battery materials, novel solar cell materials, etc. There is no
doubt that some of the proposed materials can provide a specific solution and
their properties/performance can be confirmed experimentally, at the same time
there are many false predictions because of the computational errors or the
Lego-land approach to study 2D materials. To reduce the gap between theoretical
and experimental works, we perform a systematic review of computational and
Lego-land factors that should be minimized in future theoretical works.

The ability to control magnetic properties of materials is crucial for
fundamental research and underpins many information technologies. In this
context, two-dimensional materials are a particularly exciting platform due to
their high degree of tunability and ease of implementation into nanoscale
devices. Here we report two approaches for manipulating the A-type
antiferromagnetic properties of the layered semiconductor CrSBr through
hydrostatic pressure and ligand substitution. Hydrostatic pressure compresses
the unit cell, increasing the interlayer exchange energy while lowering the
N\'eel temperature. Ligand substitution, realized synthetically through Cl
alloying, anisotropically compresses the unit cell and suppresses the
Cr-halogen covalency, reducing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and
decreasing the N\'eel temperature. A detailed structural analysis combined with
first-principles calculations reveal that alterations in the magnetic
properties are intricately related to changes in direct Cr-Cr exchange
interactions and the Cr-anion superexchange pathways. Further, we demonstrate
that Cl alloying enables chemical tuning of the interlayer coupling from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, which is unique amongst known
two-dimensional magnets. The magnetic tunability, combined with a high ordering
temperature, chemical stability, and functional semiconducting properties, make
CrSBr an ideal candidate for pre- and post-synthetic design of magnetism in
two-dimensional materials.

Using a theoretical field Gaussian approximation we have studied Rabi coupled
two component Bose mixtures at low temperatures. We have derived extended
Hugenholtz-Pines relations taking into account one body interaction (e.g. Rabi
coupling) and studied the critical temperature $T_c$ of BEC transition. We have
shown that, the shift of $T_c$ due to this interaction cannot exceed $\sim 60
\%$ and goes to a plateau with increasing the parameter $\Omega_R/T_{c}^{0}$,
where $\Omega_R$ is the intensity of the coupling and $T_{c}^{0}$ is the
critical temperature of the system with $\Omega_R=0$. Moreover, the shift is
always positive and does not depend on the sign of the one body interaction.

Unconventional Weyl phonons with higher topological charges in crystalline
solids have attracted increasing attention. By symmetry analysis and low-energy
$k.p$ effective Hamiltonian, we propose the symmetry enforced triple hourglass
Weyl phonons (THWPs) with Chern number $\mathcal C$ = $\pm$ 3 protected by
$6_3$ screw rotation symmetry in chiral space groups 173 ($P6_3$) and 182
($P6_322$). We take LiIO$_3$ with space group 173 as a candidate and confirm
that it possesses THWP with linear and quadratic dispersions along the $k_z$
direction and in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane, respectively. Due to the constraints of
crystal symmetry and topological charge conservation, six equivalent single
Weyl phonons (SWPs) emerge and lie in the $k_z$ = 0 plane. Therefore, the
unique phonon surface arcs connect the projections of two THWPs and six SWPs,
leading to nontrivial sextuple-helicoid surface arcs on the (001) surface
Brillouin zone. Our work proposes a class of topological phonons and realizes
it in realistic materials, providing a perfect platform for experimental
observation of THWPs. We expect our work to provide a new idea for detection of
unconventional quasiparticles.

<h3>Hamiltonian Transformation for Band Structure Calculations</h3>

<br>
First-principles electronic band structure calculations are essential for
understanding periodic systems in condensed matter physics and materials
science. We propose an accurate and parameter-free method, called Hamiltonian
transformation (HT), to calculate band structures in both density functional
theory (DFT) and post-DFT calculations with plane-wave basis sets. The cost of
HT is independent of the choice of the density functional and scales as
$\mathcal{O}(N_e^3N_k\log N_k)$, where $N_e$ and $N_k$ are the number of
electrons and the number of $\mathbf{k}$-points. Compared to the widely used
Wannier interpolation (WI), HT adopts an eigenvalue transformation to construct
a spatial localized representation of the spectrally truncated Hamiltonian. HT
also uses a non-iterative algorithm to change the basis sets to circumvent the
construction of the maximally localized Wannier functions. As a result, HT can
significantly outperform WI in terms of the accuracy of the band structure
calculation. We also find that the eigenvalue transformation can be of
independent interest, and can be used to improve the accuracy of the WI for
systems with entangled bands.

<h3>Quantum shape oscillations in the thermodynamic properties of confined  electrons in core-shell nanostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum shape effect appears under the size-invariant shape transformations
of strongly confined structures. Such a transformation distinctively influences
the thermodynamic properties of confined particles. Due to their characteristic
geometry, core-shell nanostructures are good candidates for quantum shape
effects to be observed. Here we investigate the thermodynamic properties of
non-interacting degenerate electrons confined in core-shell nanowires
consisting of an insulating core and a GaAs semiconducting shell. We derive the
expressions of shape-dependent thermodynamic quantities and show the existence
of a new type of quantum oscillations due to shape dependence, in chemical
potential, internal energy, entropy and specific heat of confined electrons. We
provide physical understanding of our results by invoking the quantum boundary
layer concept and evaluating the distributions of quantized energy levels on
Fermi function and in state space. Besides the density, temperature and size,
the shape per se also becomes a control parameter on the Fermi energy of
confined electrons, which provides a new mechanism for fine tuning the Fermi
level and changing the polarity of semiconductors.

The discovery of a very rich phase diagram in twisted bilayer graphene [1,2]
renewed the interest into the properties of other systems based on graphene. An
unexpected finding has been the observation of superconductivity in non-twisted
graphene bilayers and trilayers [3-5]. In this perspective, we give an overview
of the search for uncommon phases in non-twisted graphene systems. We first
describe results related to the topic before the aforementioned experiments
[3-5] were published. Then, we address the new experimental findings which have
triggered the recent interest in the problem. Lastly, we analyze the already

Strain engineering is a vital way to manipulate the electronic properties of
two-dimensional (2D) materials. As a typical representative of transition metal
mono-chalcogenides (TMMs), a honeycomb CuSe monolayer features with
one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e patterns owing to the uniaxial strain along one of
three equivalent orientations of Cu(111) substrates. Here, by combining
low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) experiments
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate
the electronic properties of the strained CuSe monolayer on the Cu(111)
substrate. Our results show the semiconducting feature of CuSe monolayer with a
band gap of 1.28 eV and the 1D periodical modulation of electronic properties
by the 1D moir\'e patterns. Except for the uniaxially strained CuSe monolayer,
we observed domain boundary and line defects in the CuSe monolayer, where the
biaxial-strain and strain-free conditions can be investigated respectively. STS
measurements for the three different strain regions show that the first peak in
conduction band will move downward with the increasing strain. DFT calculations
based on the three CuSe atomic models with different strain inside reproduced
the peak movement. The present findings not only enrich the fundamental
comprehension toward the influence of strain on electronic properties at 2D
limit, but also offer the benchmark for the development of 2D semiconductor
materials.

<h3>SIS model of disease extinction on heterogeneous directed population  networks</h3>

Understanding the spread of diseases through complex networks is of great
interest where realistic, heterogeneous contact patterns play a crucial role in
the spread. Most works have focused on mean-field behavior -- quantifying how
contact patterns affect the emergence and stability of (meta)stable endemic
states in networks. On the other hand, much less is known about longer time
scale dynamics, such as disease extinction, whereby inherent process
stochasticity and contact heterogeneity interact to produce large fluctuations
that result in the spontaneous clearance of infection. Here we show that
heterogeneity in both susceptibility and infectiousness (incoming and outgoing
degree, respectively) has a non-trivial effect on extinction in directed
contact networks, both speeding-up and slowing-down extinction rates depending
on the relative proportion of such edges in a network, and on whether the
heterogeneities in the incoming and outgoing degrees are correlated or
anticorrelated. In particular, we show that weak anticorrelated heterogeneity
can increase the disease stability, whereas strong heterogeneity gives rise to
markedly different results for correlated and anticorrelated heterogeneous
networks. All analytical results are corroborated through various numerical
schemes including network Monte-Carlo simulations.

<h3>On the validity of SLAC fermions for the 1+1D helical Luttinger liquid</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhenjiu Wang, Fakher Assaad, Maksim Ulybyshev</i>
<br>
<br>
The Nielson-Ninomiya theorem states that a chirally invariant free fermion
lattice action, which is local, translation invariant, and real necessarily has
fermion doubling. The SLAC approach gives up on locality and long range hopping
leads to a linear dispersion with singularity at the zone boundary. We
introduce a SLAC Hamiltonian formulation of the U(1) helical Luttinger liquid
and compare our results to bosonization. We argue that non-locality and
concomitant singularity at the zone edge has important implications. Large
momentum transfers yield spurious features already in the non-interacting case.
Upon switching interactions non-locality invalidates the Mermin-Wagner theorem
and allows for long ranged magnetic ordering such that a single particle gap
opens at the Dirac point. Nonetheless, since non-locality allows for charge
fluctuations at any length scale, the ground state remains metallic. Hence,
SLAC and bosonization results show marked differences already at intermediate
coupling strengths.

CsPbI3 has recently received tremendous attention as a possible absorber of
perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, CsPbI3-based PSCs have yet to achieve
the high performance of the hybrid PSCs. In this work, we performed a density
functional theory (DFT) study using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package
(CASTEP) code for the cubic CsPbI3 absorber to compare and evaluate its
structural, electronic, and optical properties. The calculated electronic band
gap (Eg) using the GGA-PBE approach of CASTEP was 1.483 eV for this CsPbI3
absorber. Moreover, the computed density of states (DOS) exhibited the dominant
contribution from the Pb-5d orbital, and most charge also accumulated for the
Pb atom as seen from the electronic charge density map. Fermi surface
calculation showed multiband character, and optical properties were computed to
investigate the optical response of CsPbI3. Furthermore, we used IGZO, SnO2,
WS2, CeO2, PCBM, TiO2, ZnO, and C60 as the electron transport layers (ETLs),
and Cu2O, CuSCN, CuSbS2, Spiro-MeOTAD, V2O5, CBTS, CFTS, P3HT, PEDOT: PSS, NiO,
CuO, and CuI as the hole transport layers (HTLs) to identify the best
HTL/CsPbI3/ETL combinations using the SCAPS-1D solar cell simulation software.
Among 96 device structures, the best-optimized device structure,
ITO/TiO2/CsPbI3/CBTS/Au was identified, which exhibited an efficiency of 17.9%.
The effect of absorber and ETL thickness, series resistance, shunt resistance,
and operating temperature was also evaluated for the six best devices along
with their corresponding generation rate, recombination rate,
capacitance-voltage, current density-voltage, and quantum efficiency
characteristics. The obtained results from SCAPS-1D were also compared with
wxAMPS simulation software.

<h3>Short-range order in archetypal disordered Cu3Au: effects on  thermodynamic, structural, and mechanical properties</h3>

Density-functional theory based electronic-structure method was used to
demonstrate the effect of chemical short-range order (SRO) on thermodynamic,
structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of archetypal
face-centered-cubic Cu$_{3}$Au alloy. We show that SRO can be tuned to modify
bonding characteristics, lattice dynamics (i.e., phonons), and electronic
structure of disordered Cu$_{3}$Au with direct impact on thermodynamic and
mechanical properties. The formation energy of disordered phase (-34.3
meV-atom$^{-1}$) was found to increase by nearly 34 meV-atom$^{-1}$ in presence
of SRO (-68.2 meV-atom$^{-1}$). The vibrational entropy estimated form phonon
dispersions decreases with increasing short-range order, which shows
significant drop below room temperature, e.g., from 9$k_{B}$ at 300 K to
6$k_{B}$ at 100 K. The SRO shows weak effect on average mechanical properties
(Bulk, Young's, and Shear moduli), however, the directional dependence of
Young's and Shear moduli was increased substantially in presence of SRO. We
established through detailed analysis of archetypal Cu$_{3}$Au that ignoring
SRO may lead to a skewed view of the actual properties of the disordered phase
of more chemically complex alloys. More generally, our results indicate SRO can
be used as a control parameter that can be tuned to achieve desirable
properties.

<h3>Quantum phase transitions in the triangular coupled-top model</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the coupled-top model with three large spins located on a triangle.
Depending on the coupling strength, there exist three phases: disordered
paramagnetic phase, ferromagnetic phase, and frustrated antiferromagnetic
phase, which can be distinguished by the mean-field approach. The
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition is accompanied by the breaking of
the global $Z_2$ symmetry, whereas the paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase
transition is accompanied by the breaking of both the global $Z_2$ symmetry and
the translational symmetry. Exact analytical results of higher-order quantum
effects beyond the mean-field contribution, such as the excitation energy,
quantum fluctuation and von Neumann entropy, can be achieved by the
Holstein-Primakoff transformation and symplectic transformation in the
thermodynamic limit. Near the quantum critical point, the energy gap closes,
along with the divergence of the quantum fluctuation in certain quadrature and
von Neumann entropy. Particular attention should be paid to the
antiferromagnetic phase, where the geometric frustration takes effect. The
critical behaviors in the antiferromagnetic phase are quite different from
those in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, which highlights the
importance of the geometric frustration. The triangular coupled-top model
provides a simple and feasible platform to study the quantum phase transition
and the novel critical behaviors induced by the geometric frustration.

<br>
<br>
Correcting scan-positional errors is critical in achieving electron
ptychography with both high resolution and high precision. This is a demanding
and challenging task due to the sheer number of parameters that need to be
optimized. For atomic-resolution ptychographic reconstructions, we found
classical refining methods for scan positions not satisfactory due to the
inherent entanglement between the object and scan positions, which can produce
systematic errors in the results. Here, we propose a new protocol consisting of
a series of constrained gradient descent (CGD) methods to achieve better
recovery of scan positions. The central idea of these CGD methods is to utilize
a priori knowledge about the nature of STEM experiments and add necessary
constraints to isolate different types of scan positional errors during the
iterative reconstruction process. Each constraint will be introduced with the
help of simulated 4D-STEM datasets with known positional errors. Then the
integrated constrained gradient decent (iCGD) protocol will be demonstrated
using an experimental 4D-STEM dataset of the 1H-MoS2 monolayer. We will show
that the iCGD protocol can effectively address the errors of scan positions
across the spectrum and help to achieve electron ptychography with high
accuracy and precision.

Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the measurement of magnetization dynamics
in general have become sophisticated tools for the study of magnetic systems at
the nanoscale. Nanosystems, such as the nanodots of this study, are
technologically important structures, which find applications in a number of
devices, such as magnetic storage and spintronic systems. In this work, we
describe the detailed investigation of cobalt nanodot arrays having a 200 nm
diameter and square pitch array with a periodicity of 400 nm. Due to their
size, such structures can support standing spin-wave modes, which can have
complex spectral responses. To interpret the experimentally measured broadband
FMR, we are comparing the spectra of the nanoarray structure with the
unpatterned film of identical thickness. This allows us to obtain the general
magnetic properties of the system, such as the magnetization, g-factor and
magnetic anisotropy. We then use state-of-the-art simulations of the dynamic
response to identify the nature of the excitation modes. This allows us to
assess the boundary conditions for the system. We then proceed to calculate the
spectral response of our system, for which we obtained good agreement. Indeed,
our procedure provides a high degree of confidence since we have interpreted
all the experimental data to a good degree of accuracy. In presenting this
work, we provide a full description of the theoretical framework and its
application to our system, and we also describe in detail the novel simulation
method used.

Majorana bound states (MBS) at the end of nanowires have been proposed as one
of the most important candidate for the topological qubits. However, similar
tunneling conductance features for both the MBS and Andreev bound states (ABS)
have turned out to be a major obstacle in the verification of the presence of
MBS in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures. In this article, we use a
protocol to probe properties specific to the MBS and use it to distinguish the
topological zero-bias peak (ZBP) from a trivial one. For a scenario involving
quantized ZBP in the nanowire, we propose a scheme wherein the length of the
topological region in the wire is altered. The tunneling conductance signatures
can then be utilized to gauge the impact on the energy of the low-energy
states. We show that the topological and trivial ZBP behave differently under
our protocol, in particular, the topological ZBP remains robust at zero bias
throughout the protocol, while the trivial ZBP splits into two peaks at finite
bias. This protocol probes the protection of near zero energy states due to
their separable nature, allowing us to distinguish between topological and
trivial ZBP.

Isolated quantum systems follow the unitary evolution, which guarantees the
full many body state always keeps a constant entropy as its initial one. Here
we consider the local dynamics of a quantum Ising model with a finite size. It
turns out, for both strong and weak coupling situations, the dynamics of local
observables exhibits similar relaxation behavior as the macroscopic
thermodynamics, which is called the local relaxation; after a certain typical
time, the relaxation behavior suddenly changes and appears random, which is
referred as a recurrence. Besides, we find that the total correlation entropy
of this system approximately exhibit a monotonic increasing envelope in both
strong and weak coupling cases, which is quite similar as the irreversible
entropy production in the standard macroscopic thermodynamics.

The application of superconducting materials is becoming more and more
widespread. Traditionally, the discovery of new superconducting materials
relies on the experience of experts and a large number of "trial and error"
experiments, which not only increases the cost of experiments but also prolongs
the period of discovering new superconducting materials. In recent years,
machine learning has been increasingly applied to materials science. Based on
this, this manuscript proposes the use of XGBoost model to identify
superconductors; the first application of deep forest model to predict the
critical temperature of superconductors; the first application of deep forest
to predict the band gap of materials; and application of a new sub-network
model to predict the Fermi energy level of materials. Compared with our known
similar literature, all the above algorithms reach state-of-the-art. Finally,
this manuscript uses the above models to search the COD public dataset and
identify 50 candidate superconducting materials with possible critical
temperature greater than 90 K.

<h3>T-linear resistivity in the strange-metal phase of cuprate  superconductors due to umklapp scattering from a spin excitation</h3>

The strange-metal phase of cuprate superconductors exhibits a linear in
temperature resistivity, however, the origin of this remarkable anomaly is
still not well understood. Here the linear temperature dependence of the
electrical resistivity in the strange-metal phase of cuprate superconductors is
investigated from the underdoped to overdoped regimes. The momentum dependence
of the transport scattering rate arising from the umklapp scattering between
electrons by the exchange of the spin excitation is derived and employed to
calculate the electrical resistivity by making use of the Boltzmann equation.
It is shown that the antinodal umklapp scattering leads to the linear in
temperature resistivity in the low-temperature with the temperature linear
coefficient that decreases with the increase of the doping concentration,
however, the nodal umklapp scattering induces a deviation from the linear in
temperature resistivity in the far lower temperature, and then the quadratic in
temperature resistivity in the far lower temperature is generated by both the
antinodal and nodal umklapp scattering. The theory also shows that the same
spin excitation that acts like a bosonic glue to hold the electron pairs
together also mediates scattering of electrons in the strange-metal phase of
cuprtae superconductors responsible for the linear in temperature resistivity
and the associated electronic structure.

The complex structure of the Remeika phases, the intriguing quantum states
they display, and their low carrier concentrations are a strong motivation to
study the nature of their superconducting phases. In this work, the microscopic
properties of the superconducting phase of single-crystalline
Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ are investigated by muon-spin relaxation and rotation
($\mu$SR) measurements. The zero-field $\mu$SR data reveal the presence of
spontaneous static or quasi-static magnetic fields in the superconducting
state, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the associated internal magnetic field
scale is found to be exceptionally large ($\approx$ 0.18~mT). Furthermore,
transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements in the vortex state of
Lu$_3$Os$_4$Ge$_{13}$ imply a complex gap function with significantly different
strengths on different parts of the Fermi surface. While our measurements do
not completely determine the order parameter, they strongly indicate that
electron-electron interactions are essential to stabilizing pairing in the
system, thus, demonstrating its unconventional nature.

Nonunitary superconductivity has attracted renewed interest as a novel
gapless phase of matter. In this study, we investigate the superconducting gap
structure of nonunitary odd-parity chiral pairing states in a superconductor
involving strong spin-orbit interactions. By applying a group theoretical
classification of chiral states in terms of discrete rotation symmetry, we
categorized all possible point-nodal gap structures in nonunitary chiral states
into four types in terms of the topological number of nodes and node positions
relative to the rotation axis. In addition to conventional Dirac and Weyl point
nodes, we identify a novel type of Dirac point node unique to nonunitary chiral
superconducting states. The node type can be identified experimentally based on
the temperature dependence of the nuclear magnetic resonance longitudinal
relaxation rate. The implication of our results for a nonunitary odd-parity
superconductor in UTe$_2$ is also discussed.

<h3>The Highest Melting Point Material: Searched by Bayesian Global  Optimization with Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics</h3>

The interest in refractory materials is increasing rapidly in recent decades
due to the development of hypersonic vehicles. However, which substance has the
highest melting point keeps a secret, since precise measurements in extreme
condition are overwhelmingly difficult. In the present work, an accurate deep
potential model of Hf-Ta-C-N system was firstly trained, and then applied to
search for the highest melting point material by using molecular dynamics
simulation and Bayesian global optimization. The predicted melting points agree
well with experiments, and confirm that the carbon site vacancy can enhance
melting points of rock-salt structure carbides. Solid solution with N is
verified as another new and more effective melting point enhancing approach for
HfC, while the conventional routing of solid solution with Ta (e.g. HfTa4C5) is
not suggested to result in a maximum melting point. The highest melting point
(~ 4236 K) is achieved with composition of HfC0.638N0.271, which is ~ 80 K
higher than the highest value in Hf-C binary system. The dominating mechanism
of N addition is believed to be the instable C-N and N-N bonds in liquid phase,
which reduces the liquid phase entropy and renders the liquid phase less
stable. The improved melting point and fewer gas generation during oxidation by
addition of N provides new routing to modify the thermal protection materials
for hypersonic vehicles.

We consider two models of interacting DNA molecules: \textit{First} is (four
parametric) bubble coalescence model in interacting DNAs (shortly: BCI-DNA).
\textit{Second} is (three parametric) bubble coalescence model in a condensed
DNA molecules (shortly BCC-DNA). To study bubble coalescence thermodynamics of
BCI-DNA and BCC-DNA models we use methods of statistical physics. Namely, we
define Hamiltonian of each model and give their translation-invariant Gibbs
measures (TIGMs). For the first model we find parameters such that
corresponding Hamiltonian has up to three TIGMs (three phases of system)
biologically meaning existence of three states: ``No bubble coalescence'',
``Dominated soft zone'', ``Bubble coalescence''. For the second model we show
that for any (admissible) parameters this model has unique TIGM. This is a
state where ``No bubble coalescence'' phase dominates.

<h3>Triclinic BiFeO3: A new magnetic phase with enhanced magnetism and  resistivity</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetic and transport properties of BiFeO3/La2NiMnO6 (BFO/LNMO)
composite have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Unlike
the normal rhombohedral (R3c) phase, BFO in the composites is crystallized in
the triclinic phase (P1). Interestingly, the composites demonstrate a
significant enhancement in the magnetization, magnetoelectric coupling and show
higher resistivity than that of the regular BFO (R3c). As LNMO has its Curie
temperature at 280 K, the room temperature and above room temperature magnetic
contribution in the composites is expected to be from the triclinic BFO phase.
Experimentally observed enhancement in magnetization is validated using
classical Monte Carlo simulation and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The calculated band structures show a more delocalized band edge
in triclinic BFO which suggests the higher carrier effective mass i.e.,
enhanced resistivity in triclinic BFO as compared to the rhombohedral BFO.
Overall, this study reveals triclinic BFO as the promising room temperature
multiferroic phase which is helpful to optimize the multiferroicity of BFO and
achieve wider applications in future.

<br>
<br>
We highlight certain key achievements in experimental work on molecular,
colloidal and granular glassformers. This short review considers these three
classes of experimental systems and focusses largely on the work of the authors
and their coworkers and thus is far from exhaustive. Our goal is rather to
discuss particular experimental results from these classes and to explore
universality and specificity across the broad range of length- and time-scales
they span. We emphasize that a variety of phenomena, not least dynamical
heterogeneity, growing lengthscales and a change in structure, albeit subtle,
are now well established in these three classes of glassformer. We then review
some experimental measurements which depend more specifically on the class of
glassformer, such as the Gardner transition and some which have been
investigated more in one or two classes than in all, such as configurational
entropy and evidence for a dynamical phase transition. We finally put forward
some open questions and consider what could be done to fill some of the gaps
between theoretical approaches and experiments.

<h3>Fragmentation and correlations in a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate  undergoing breakup</h3>

The theoretical investigation of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates has
mainly focused on the emergence of quantum vortex states and the condensed
properties of such systems. In the present work, we concentrate on other facets
by examining the impact of rotation on the ground state of weakly interacting
bosons confined in anharmonic potentials computed both at the mean-field level
and particularly at the many-body level of theory. For the many-body
computations, we employ the well-established many-body method known as the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). We
present how various degrees of fragmentation can be generated following the
breakup of the ground state densities in anharmonic traps without ramping up a
potential barrier for strong rotations. The breakup of the densities is found
to be associated with the acquisition of angular momentum in the condensate due
to the rotation. In addition to fragmentation, the presence of many-body
correlations is examined by computing the variances of the many-particle
position and momentum operators. For strong rotations, the many-body variances
become smaller than their mean-field counterparts, and one even finds a
scenario with opposite anisotropies of the mean-field and many-body variances.
Further, it is observed that for higher discrete symmetric systems of order k,
namely three-fold and four-fold symmetry, breakup to k sub-clouds and emergence
of k-fold fragmentation take place. All in all, we provide a thorough many-body
investigation of how and which correlations build up when a trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate breaks up under rotation.

<h3>Anomalous Hall effect in disordered Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Yonatan Messica, Dmitri. B. Gutman, Pavel M. Ostrovsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the anomalous Hall effect in a disordered Weyl semimetal. While the
intrinsic contribution is expressed solely in terms of Berry curvature, the
extrinsic contribution is given by a combination of the skew scattering and
side jump terms. For the model of small size impurities, we are able to express
the skew scattering contribution in terms of scattering phase shifts. We
identify the regime in which the skew scattering contribution dominates the
side-jump contribution: the impurities are either strong or resonant, and at
dilute concentration. In this regime, the Hall resistivity $\rho_{xy}$ is
expressed in terms of two scattering phases, analogous to the s-wave scattering
phase in a non-topological metal. We compute the dependence of $\rho_{xy}$ on
the chemical potential, and show that $\rho_{xy}$ scales with temperature as
$T^2$ in low temperatures and as $T^{3/2}$ in the high temperature limit.

<br>
<br>
Within the glassy liquids community, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to
model particles' static structure in order to predict their future dynamics is
currently a hot topic. The actual state of the art consists in Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) (Bapst 2020) which, beside having a great expressive power, are
heavy models with numerous parameters and lack interpretability. Inspired by
recent advances (Thomas 2018), we build a GNN that learns a robust
representation of the glass' static structure by constraining it to preserve
the roto-translation (SE(3)) equivariance. We show that this constraint not
only significantly improves the predictive power but also allows to reduce the
number of parameters while improving the interpretability. Furthermore, we
relate our learned equivariant features to well-known invariant expert
features, which are easily expressible with a single layer of our network.

<h3>Time evolution of nonadditive entropies: The logistic map</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03261</a>
<br>
<i>Constantino Tsallis, Ernesto P. Borges</i>
<br>
<br>
Due to the second principle of thermodynamics, the time dependence of entropy
for all kinds of systems under all kinds of physical circumstances always
thrives interest. The logistic map $x_{t+1}=1-a x_t^2 \in [-1,1]\;(a\in [0,2])$
is neither large, since it has only one degree of freedom, nor closed, since it
is dissipative. It exhibits, nevertheless, a peculiar time evolution of its
natural entropy, which is the additive Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon one,
$S_{BG}=-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$, for all values of $a$ for which the
Lyapunov exponent is positive, and the nonadditive one $S_q=
\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ with $q=0.2445\dots$ at the edge of chaos,
where the Lyapunov exponent vanishes, $W$ being the number of windows of the
phase space partition. We numerically show that, for increasing time, the
phase-space-averaged entropy overshoots above its stationary-state value in all
cases. However, when $W\to\infty$, the overshooting gradually disappears for
the most chaotic case ($a=2$), whereas, in remarkable contrast, it appears to
monotonically diverge at the Feigenbaum point ($a=1.4011\dots$). Consequently,
the stationary-state entropy value is achieved from {\it above}, instead of
from {\it below}, as it could have been a priori expected. These results raise
the question whether the usual requirements -- large, closed, and for generic
initial conditions -- for the second principle validity might be necessary but
not sufficient.

<h3>Machine-learning approach for discovery of conventional superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
First-principles computations are the driving force behind numerous
discoveries of hydride-based superconductors, mostly at high pressures, during
the last decade. Machine-learning (ML) approaches can further accelerate the
future discoveries if their reliability can be improved. The main challenge of
current ML approaches, typically aiming at predicting the critical temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ of a solid from its chemical composition and target pressure, is
that the correlations to be learned are deeply hidden, indirect, and uncertain.
In this work, we showed that predicting superconductivity at any pressure from
the atomic structure is sustainable and reliable. For a demonstration, we
curated a diverse dataset of 584 atomic structures for which $\lambda$ and
$\omega_{\log}$, two parameters of the electron-phonon interactions, were
computed. We then trained some ML models to predict $\lambda$ and
$\omega_{\log}$, from which $T_{\rm c}$ can be computed in a post-processing
manner. The models were validated and used to identify two possible
superconductors whose $T_{\rm c}\simeq 10-15$K and zero pressure. Going
forward, this strategy will be improved to better contribute to the discoveries
of new superconductors.

<h3>Three-particle model for the nonlinear response of frictional granular  materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a simple model comprising three particles to study the nonlinear
mechanical response of jammed frictional granular materials under oscillatory
shear. Owing to the introduction of the simple model, we obtain an exact
analytical expression of the complex shear modulus for a system including many
monodispersed disks, which satisfies a scaling law in the vicinity of the
jamming point. These expressions perfectly reproduce the shear modulus of the
many-body system with low strain amplitudes and friction coefficients. Even for
disordered many-body systems, the model reproduces results by introducing a
single fitting parameter.

<br>
<br>
The interplay between topology and criticality has been a recent interest of
study in condensed matter physics. A unique topological transition between
certain critical phases has been observed as a consequence of the edge modes
living at criticalities. In this work, we generalize this phenomenon by
investigating possible transitions between critical phases which are non-high
symmetry in nature. We find the triviality and non-triviality of these critical
phases in terms of the decay length of the edge modes and also characterize
them using the winding numbers. The distinct non-high symmetry critical phases
are separated by multicritical points with linear dispersion at which the
winding number exhibits the quantized jump, indicating a change in the topology
(number of edge modes) at the critical phases. Moreover, we reframe the scaling
theory based on the curvature function, i.e. curvature function renormalization
group method to efficiently address the non-high symmetry criticalities and
multicriticalities. Using this we identify the conventional topological
transition between gapped phases through non-high symmetry critical points, and
also the unique topological transition between critical phases through
multicritical points. The renormalization group flow, critical exponents and
correlation function of Wannier states enable the characterization of non-high
symmetry criticalities along with multicriticalities.

<h3>Quasi-equilibrium polariton condensates in the non-linear regime and  beyond</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the many-body behavior of polaritons formed from electron-hole
pairs strongly coupled to photons in a two-dimensional semiconductor
microcavity. We use a microscopic mean-field BCS theory that describes
polariton condensation in quasi-equilibrium across the full range of excitation
densities. In the limit of vanishing density, we show that our theory recovers
the exact single-particle properties of polaritons, while at low densities it
captures non-linear polariton-polariton interactions within the Born
approximation. For the case of highly screened contact interactions between
charge carriers, we obtain analytic expressions for the equation of state of
the many-body system. This allows us to show that there is a photon resonance
at a chemical potential higher than the photon cavity energy, where the
electron-hole pair correlations in the polariton condensate become universal
and independent of the details of the carrier interactions. Comparing the
effect of different ranged interactions between charge carriers, we find that
the Rytova-Keldysh potential (relevant to transition metal dichalcogenides)
offers the best prospect of reaching the BCS regime, where pairs strongly
overlap and the minimum pairing gap occurs at finite momentum. Finally, going
beyond thermal equilibrium, we argue that there are generically two polariton
branches in the driven-dissipative system and we discuss the possibility of a
density-driven exceptional point within our model.

<h3>Interaction of gapless spin waves and a domain wall in an easy-cone  ferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the interaction of spin waves and a domain wall in a
quasi-one-dimensional easy-cone ferromagnet. The gapless spin waves on top of a
domain wall are found to exhibit finite reflection in contrast to the
well-known perfect transmission of gapful spin waves in easy-axis magnets.
Based on the obtained scattering properties, we study the thermal-magnon-driven
dynamics of a domain wall subjected to a thermal bias within the
Landau-B\"uttiker formalism, where transmitted magnons are shown to exert the
magnonic torque on the domain wall and thereby drive it with the velocity
linear to the applied thermal bias. The peculiar gapless nature of spin waves
in easy-cone magnets enables the thermally-driven domain-wall motion even at
low temperatures, differing from the easy-axis case where the domain-wall
velocity is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures. Our work suggests
that easy-cone magnets can serve as a useful platform to study the interaction
of gapless spin waves and nonlinear excitations and thereby realize
low-temperature magnon-related phenomena.

Understanding and tuning of the glass forming ability of metallic glasses
requires atomic-level knowledge of structure evolutions of supercooled liquids
at low temperatures. However, the accurate description of inter-atomic
interactions and the dramatically increasing relaxing time in the deep
supercooled region hinders a realistic description of local structure ordering,
which leaves the microscopic structure evolution in the deep supercooled region
rarely touched so far. We present a comprehensive analysis of realistic
metallic glasses systems to demonstrate that both challenges could be tackled
efficiently and simultaneously through combination of accurate neural network
based inter-atomic potential and an efficient hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm
incorporating swaps of atom pairs. We compare the performance of our algorithm
with ordinary molecular dynamics and show that it effectively samples the phase
space and generates realistic metallic glasses samples over unprecedented range
of glass stabilities, which opens the door for accurate atomic-level
understanding of the structure, physical properties, and moreover, the
glass-forming ability of laboratory-generated metallic glasses systems.

<br>
The rapidly evolving utilization of spin Hall effect (SHE) arising from
spin-orbit coupling in 5d transition metals and alloys have made giant strides
in the development of designing low-power, robust and non-volatile magnetic
memory. Recent studies, on incorporating non-metallic lighter elements such as
oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur into 5d transition metals, have shown an
enhancement in damping-like torque efficiency {\theta}_DL due to the modified
SHE, but the mechanism behind this enhancement is not clear. In this paper, we
study {\theta}_DL at different temperatures (100-293 K) to disentangle the
intrinsic and extrinsic side-jump scattering induced spin Hall effect in
N-implanted Pt. We observe a crossover of intrinsic to extrinsic side-jump
mechanism as the implantation dose increases from 2*10^16 ions/cm2 to 1*10^17
ions/cm2. A sudden decrease in the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity is
counterbalanced by the increase in the side-jump induced SHE efficiency. These
results conclude that studying {\theta}_DL as a function of implantation dose,
and also as a function of temperature, is important to understand the physical
mechanism contributing to SHE, which has so far been unexplored in
incorporating non-metallic element in 5d transition metals.

<h3>Vapor-liquid-solid growth of highly-mismatched semiconductor nanowires  with high-fidelity van der Waals layer stacking</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nanobelts, nanoribbons and other quasi-one-dimensional nanostructures formed
from layered, so-called, van der Waals semiconductors have garnered much
attention due to their high-performance, tunable optoelectronic properties. For
layered alloys made from the gallium monochalcogenides GaS, GaSe, and GaTe,
near-continuous tuning of the energy bandgap across the full composition range
has been achieved in GaSe1-xSx and GaSe1-xTex alloys. Gold-catalyzed
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth of these alloys yields predominantly nanobelts,
nanoribbons and other nanostructures for which the fast crystal growth front
consists of layer edges in contact with the catalyst. We demonstrate that in
the S-rich, GaS1-xTex system, unlike GaSe1-xSx and GaSe1-xTex, the Au-catalyzed
VLS process yields van der Waals nanowires for which the fast growth direction
is normal to the layers. The high mismatch between S and Te leads to
extraordinary bowing of the GaS1-xTex alloy's energy bandgap, decreasing by at
least 0.6 eV for x as small as 0.03. Calculations using density functional
theory confirm the significant decrease in bandgap in S-rich GaS1-xTex. The
nanowires can exceed fifty micrometers in length, consisting of tens of
thousands of van der Waals-bonded layers with triangular or hexagonal
cross-sections of uniform dimensions along the length of the nanowire. We
propose that the low solubility of Te in GaS results in an enhancement in Te
coverage around the Au catalyst-nanowire interface, confining the catalyst to
the chalcogen-terminated basal plane (rather than the edges) and thereby
enabling layer-by-layer, c-axis growth.

<h3>Elastic heterogeneity governs asymmetric adsorption-desorption in a soft  porous crystal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Molecular adsorption in soft porous materials is crucial to control
liquid-liquid phase separation in polymer networks and biological cells,
refrigeration cycles of nanosponges, and energy storage in supercapacitors. The
deformation process of host porous matrices, coupled with the adsorption of
guest molecules, plays an essential role in developing stimuli-responsive
materials. In particular, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit promising
stimuli-responsiveness and molecular adsorption selectivity, that enable
various applications based on MOFs. The adsorption of guest molecules in MOFs
changes the crystalline structure and elastic moduli of the host matrices.
Thus, the substances become elastically heterogeneous when adsorbed/desorbed
sites coexist. However, the role of elastic heterogeneity in the
adsorption-desorption transition has been overlooked. Here we show the
asymmetric role of elastic heterogeneity in the adsorption-desorption
transition. We construct a minimal model incorporating adsorption-induced
lattice expansion and an increase in the elastic moduli, and discover that the
transition is hindered entropically during the adsorption process and
energetically during the desorption process, leading to the strong hysteretic
nature of the transition. Furthermore, the adsorbed/desorbed sites exhibit
spatially heterogeneous domain formation due to elastic heterogeneity, implying
that the domain morphology and interfacial area between the adsorbed/desorbed
sites can be controlled by elastic heterogeneity. Our results provide a
theoretical guideline for designing soft porous crystals with tunable
adsorption hysteresis and the dispersion and domain morphology of adsorbates
using elastic heterogeneity.

We develop a general non-perturbative characterisation of universal features
of the density $\rho(\Gamma)$ of $S$-matrix poles (resonances) $E_n-i\Gamma_n$
describing waves incident and reflected from a disordered medium via a single
$M$-channel waveguide/lead. Explicit expressions for $\rho(\Gamma)$ are derived
for several instances of systems with broken time-reversal invariance, in
particular for quasi-1D and 3D media. In the case of perfectly coupled lead
with a few channels ($M\sim 1$) the most salient features are tails
$\rho(\Gamma)\sim 1/\Gamma$ for narrow resonances reflecting exponential
localization and $\rho(\Gamma)\sim 1/\Gamma^2$ for broad resonances reflecting
states located in the vicinity of the attached wire. For multimode wires with
$M\gg 1$, intermediate asymptotics $\rho(\Gamma)\sim 1/\Gamma^{3/2}$ is shown
to emerge reflecting diffusive nature of decay into wide enough contacts.

Interfacial two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), especially the SrTiO3-based
ones at the unexpected interface of insulators, have emerged to be a promising
candidate for efficient charge-spin current interconversion. In this article,
to gain insight into the mechanism of the charge-spin current interconversion
at the oxide-based 2DEG, we focused on conducting interfaces between insulating
SrTiO3 and two types of aluminium-based amorphous insulators, namely SrTiO3/AlN
and SrTiO3/Al2O3, and estimated their charge-spin conversion efficiency,
{\theta}_cs. The two types of amorphous insulators were selected to explicitly
probe the overlooked contribution of oxygen vacancy to the {\theta}_cs. We
proposed a mechanism to explain results of spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance
(ST-FMR) measurements and developed an analysis protocol to reliably estimate
the {\theta}_cs of the oxide based 2DEG. The resultant {\theta}_cs/t, where t
is the thickness of the 2DEG, were estimated to be 0.244 nm-1 and 0.101 nm-1
for the SrTiO3/AlN and SrTiO3/Al2O3, respectively, and they are strikingly
comparable to their crystalline counterparts. Furthermore, we also observe a
large direct current modulation of resonance linewidth in SrTiO3/AlN samples,
confirming its high {\theta}_cs and attesting an oxygen-vacancy-enabled
charge-spin conversion. Our findings emphasize the defects' contribution to the
charge-spin interconversion, especially in the oxide-based low dimensional
systems, and provide a way to create and enhance charge-spin interconversion
via defect engineering.

<br>
We investigate particle emission, driven by periodically modulating the
interaction strength, from three coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a
one-dimensional lattice. Within perturbative analyses, which lead to the
regimes of instabilities for different modes, we not only obtain two main
frequencies, under which the system can emit a large particle jet, but also
find that the emission is distinctly intermittent rather than continuous. The
time evolution of the trapped particles exhibits a stair-like decay, and a
larger drive induces a more significant intermittency. We further shed light on
the dynamics of the stimulating process, and demonstrate that instead of a real
suspension, the intermittency represents a build-up stage of the particles. The
theoretical framework might be generalized, to the explorations on other
multiple-condensate systems with analogous configurations and couplings.

In condensed matter physics, materials with kagome lattice exhibit exotic
emergent quantum states, including charge density wave (CDW), superconductivity
and magnetism. Very recently, hexagonal kagome metal ScV6Sn6 was found to
undergo fascinating first-order structural phase transition at around 92 K and
a 3x3x3 CDW modulation. The bulk electronic band properties are enlightened for
comprehending the origin of the structural phase transition. Here, we perform a
optical spectroscopy study on the monocrystalline compound across the
transition temperature. The structural transition gives rise to the abrupt
changes of optical spectra without observing gap development behavior. The
optical measurements revealed a sudden reconstruction of the band structure
after transition. We emphasize that the phase transition is of the first order
and distinctly different from the conventional density-wave type condensation.
Our results provide insight into the origin of the structural phase transition
in the new kagome metal compound.

Calculating viscosity in multicompoinent metallic melts is a challenging task
for both classical and \textit{ab~initio} molecular dynamics simulations
methods. The former may not to provide enough accuracy and the latter is too
resources demanding. Machine learning potentials provide optimal balance
between accuracy and computational efficiency and so seem very promising to
solve this problem. Here we address simulating kinematic viscosity in ternary
Al-Cu-Ni melts with using deep neural network potentials (DP) as implemented in
the DeePMD-kit. We calculate both concentration and temperature dependencies of
kinematic viscosity in Al-Cu-Ni and conclude that the developed potential
allows one to simulate viscosity with high accuracy; the deviation from
experimental data does not exceed 9\% and is close to the uncertainty interval
of experimental data. More importantly, our simulations reproduce minimum on
concentration dependency of the viscosity at the eutectic point. Thus, we
conclude that DP-based MD simulations is highly promising way to calculate
viscosity in multicomponent metallic melts.

Fe-B-Si system is a matrix for synthesis of new functional materials with
exceptional magnetic and mechanical properties. Progress in this area is
associated with the search for optimal doping conditions. This theoretical and
experimental study is aimed to address the influence of Ta alloying on the
structure of undercooled (Fe0.75B0.15Si0.1)100-xTax (x=0-2) melts, their
undercoolability and the processes of structure formation during
solidification. Small concentration of Ta complicates standard ab initio and
machine learning investigations. We developed a technique for fast and stable
training of machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) in this case and
uncovered the structure of the undercooled melts. Molecular dynamic simulations
with MLIP showed that at Ta concentration of 1 at.% there is a sharp change in
the chemical short-range ordering in the melt associated with a change in the
interaction of Ta atoms. This effect leads to a restructuring of the cluster
formation in the system. At the same time, our experimental investigation shows
that melts with a Ta content of 1 at.% have the greatest tendency to
undercoolability. Alloying with Ta promotes the formation of primary crystals
of Fe2B, and at a concentration of more than 1.5 at.% Ta, also of FeTaB.
Herewith, near 1 at.% Ta, the crystallization of the melt proceeds
nontrivially: with the formation of two intermediate metastable phases Fe3B and
Fe2Ta Laves phase. Also, the highest tendency to amorphization under conditions
of quick quenching is exhibited by a melt with a Ta concentration of 1 at.%.
The results not only provide understanding of optimal alloying of Fe-B-Si
materials but also promote a machine learning method for numerical design of
metallic alloys with a small dopant concentration.

High pressures allow the synthesis of new metastable compounds that remain
intact for a sufficiently long time at normal conditions. Until now, it has not
been fully understood how pressure, glass-forming ability and solidification of
liquids are interconnected. We have investigated the structure of the
glass-forming eutectic alloy Al86Ni2Co6Gd6 obtained by rapid cooling from the
melt having a temperature of 1800 K under a pressure of 10 GPa. X-ray
diffraction analysis and electron microscopy show that the samples are
homogeneous and dense. The structure is finely dispersed. New stable
crystalline phases with cubic (cP4/2) and tetragonal (tI26/1) structures are
formed in the alloy. The studies have shown that the average microhardness of
the samples obtained at 10 GPa is almost 2 times higher than that of the
original sample at atmospheric pressure and is about 1700 MPa. To understand
the results, we used ab initio molecular dynamics and studied how the melt
changes with pressure. It is shown that at a temperature of 1800 K, high
pressure increases the concentration of icosahedral clusters in the melt so
that at 10 GPa atoms inside the icosahedra form a percolation cluster, while at
atmospheric pressure they do not. Thus, the glass-forming ability of a melt
increases at high pressure strongly influencing solidification processes.

Here we present a computational study of the thermodynamic and structural
properties of bulk and confined (1,1,1,3,3-pentafuorobutane) with different
lengths of the carbon backbone. The DREIDING force field model has been used in
the method of molecular dynamics. In order to study the effect of confinement
we have placed (1,1,1,3,3-pentauorobutane) molecules between two graphene
walls. In order to study the influence of pore loading on system behavior we
have simulated systems of the same size, but with a different number of
(1,1,1,3,3-pentauorobutane) molecules, from 200 to 2000. The equations of state
at $T = 300$ K in a wide range of densities for all considered systems had a
single peculiarity that is attributed to gas-liquid transition. From the
two-dimensional radial distribution functions, density profile and angular
distribution we have observed the systems split into layers with amorphization
rather than crystallization in them.

Femtosecond core-level transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to
investigate photoinduced dynamics of the charge density wave in 1T-TiSe2 at the
Ti M2,3 edge (30-50 eV). Photoexcited carriers and phonons are found to
primarily induce spectral red-shifts of core-level excitations, and a carrier
relaxation time and phonon heating time of approximately 360 fs and 1.0 ps are
extracted, respectively. Pronounced oscillations in delay-dependent absorption
spectra are assigned to coherent excitations of the optical $A_{1g}$ phonon
(6.0 THz) and the $A_{1g}^*$ charge density wave amplitude mode (3.3 THz). By
comparing the measured spectra with time-dependent density functional theory
simulations, we determine the directions of the momentary atomic displacements
of both coherent modes and estimate their amplitudes. This work presents a
first look on charge density wave excitations with table-top core-level
transient absorption spectroscopy, enabling simultaneous access to electronic
and lattice excitation and relaxation.

<h3>Self-supervised Representations and Node Embedding Graph Neural Networks  for Accurate and Multi-scale Analysis of Materials</h3>

Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as graph neural networks (GNN),
have successfully predicted material properties. However, the superior
performance of GNN usually relies on end-to-end learning on large material
datasets, which may lose the physical insight of multi-scale information about
materials. And the process of labeling data consumes many resources and
inevitably introduces errors, which constrains the accuracy of prediction. We
propose to train the GNN model by self-supervised learning on the node and edge
information of the crystal graph. Compared with the popular manually
constructed material descriptors, the self-supervised atomic representation can
reach better prediction performance on material properties. Furthermore, it may
provide physical insights by tuning the range information. Applying the
self-supervised atomic representation on the magnetic moment datasets, we show
how they extract rules and information from the magnetic materials. To
incorporate rich physical information into the GNN model, we develop the
node-embedding graph neural networks (NEGNN) framework and show significant
improvements in the prediction performance. The self-supervised material
representation and the NEGNN framework may investigate in-depth information
from materials and can be applied to small datasets with increased prediction
accuracy.

In our JunPy package, we have successfully combined the self-consistent
Hamiltonian from first-principles calculations with the nonequilibrium Green's
function method to calculate the noncollinear spin torque in the nm-scale
magnetic heterojunctions. The spin-orbit coupling within the first-principles
calculations is included to determine the magnetic anisotropy (MA) of an
Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with a spin-orbit torque (SOT) method.
The angular dependence of accumulative SOT indicates the biaxial and uniaxial
MA corresponding to the in-plane and out-of-plane rotations of the free
magnetization, respectively. Our results agree with the conventional MA energy
calculation for a whole MTJ and provide insights into micro-spin dynamics of
local magnetic moments.

Recent experiments have established a type of nonsymmorphic symmetry
protected nodal lines in the family of two-dimensional (2D) composition tunable
materials NbSi$_x$Te$_2$. Here, we theoretically study the plasmonic properties
of such nonsymmorphic nodal-line semimetals. We show that the nonsymmorphic
character endows the plasmons with extremely strong anisotropy. There exist
both intraband and interband plasmon branches. The intraband branch is gapless
and has a $q^{1/2}$ dispersion. It is most dispersive and is independent of
carrier density in direction normal to the nodal line, whereas along the nodal
line, its dispersion is largely suppressed and its frequency scales linearly
with carrier density. The interband branches are gapped and their long
wavelength limits are connected with van Hove singularities of the band
structure. We find that the single particle excitations are strongly suppressed
in such systems, which decreases the Landau damping of plasmons. These
characters are further verified by first-principles calculations on 2D
NbSi$_x$Te$_2$. Interesting features in static screening of charged impurity
are also discussed. Our result reveals characteristic plasmons in a class of
nonsymmorphic topological semimetals and offers guidance for its experimental
detection and possible applications.

<br>
<i>Joël A. K. L. Picard, T. Speck</i>
<br>
<br>
Conventional gas-liquid phase transitions feature a coexistence line that has
a monotonic and positive slope in line with our intuition that cooling always
leads to condensation. Here we study the inverse phenomenon, condensation of
adsorbed organic molecules into dense domains upon heating. Our considerations
are motivated by recent experiments [Aeschlimann et al., Angew. Chem. (2021)],
which demonstrate the partial dissolution of an ordered molecular monolayer and
the mobilization of molecules upon cooling. We introduce a simple lattice model
in which each site can have three states corresponding to unoccupied and two
discernible molecular conformations. We investigate this model through Monte
Carlo simulations, mean-field theory, and exact results based on the analytical
solution of the Ising model in two dimensions. Our results should be broadly
applicable to molecules with distinct conformations that have sufficiently
different entropies or heat capacities.

<h3>Quantum-classical approach to spin and charge pumping and the ensuing  radiation in THz spintronics with example of ultrafast-light-driven Weyl  antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn</h3>

<br>
<br>
The interaction of fs light pulses with magnetic materials has been intensely
studied for more than two decades in order to understand ultrafast
demagnetization in single magnetic layers or THz emission from their bilayers
with nonmagnetic spin-orbit (SO) materials. Here we develop a multiscale
quantum-classical formalism -- where conduction electrons are described by
quantum master equation of the Lindblad type; classical dynamics of local
magnetization is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation; and
incoming light is described by classical vector potential while outgoing
electromagnetic radiation is computed using Jefimenko equations for retarded
electric and magnetic fields -- and apply it a bilayer of antiferromagnetic
Weyl semimetal Mn$_3$Sn with noncollinear local magnetization in contact with
SO-coupled nonmagnetic material. Our QME+LLG+Jefimenko scheme makes it possible
to understand how fs light pulse generates directly spin and charge pumping and
electromagnetic radiation by the latter, including both odd and even high
harmonics (of the pulse center frequency) up to order $n \le 7$. The directly
pumped spin current then exert spin torque on local magnetization whose
dynamics, in turn, pumps additional spin and charge currents radiating in the
THz range. By switching on and off LLG dynamics and SO couplings, we unravel
which microscopic mechanism contribute the most to emitted THz radiation --
charge pumping by local magnetization of Mn$_3$Sn in the presence of its
intrinsic SO coupling is far more important than standardly assumed (for other
types of magnetic layers) spin pumping and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion
within the neighboring nonmagnetic SO-coupled material.

<h3>Magnetic excitations, phase diagram and order-by-disorder in the  extended triangular-lattice Hubbard model</h3>

The dynamical structure factor is an important observable of quantum magnets
but due to numerical and theoretical limitations, it remains a challenge to
make predictions for Hubbard-like models beyond one dimension. In this work, we
study the magnetic excitations of the triangular lattice Hubbard model
including next-nearest neighbor hopping. Starting from the 120$^{\circ}$ and
stripe magnetic orders we compute the magnon spectra within a self-consistent
random phase approximation. In the stripe phase, we generically find accidental
zero modes related to a classical degeneracy known from the corresponding
$J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. We extend the order-by-disorder mechanism to
Hubbard systems and show how quantum fluctuations stabilize the stripe order.
In addition, the frustration-induced condensation of magnon modes allows us to
map out the entire phase diagram which is in remarkable agreement with recent
numerical works. We discuss connections to experiments on triangular lattice
compounds and the relation of our results to the proposed chiral spin liquid
phase.

The whole Al-Li phase diagram is predicted from first principles calculations
and statistical mechanics including the effect of configurational and
vibrational entropy. The formation enthalpy of different configurations at
different temperatures was accurately predicted by means of cluster expansions
that were fitted from first principles calculations. The vibrational entropic
contribution of each configuration was determined from the bond length vs. bond
stiffness relationships for each type of bond and the Gibbs free energy of the
different phases was obtained as a function of temperature from Monte Carlo
simulations. The predicted phase diagram was in excellent agreement with the
currently accepted experimental one in terms of the stable (AlLi, Al2Li3,
AlLi2, Al4Li9) and metastable (Al3Li) phases, of the phase boundaries between
them and of the maximum stability temperature of line compounds. In addition,
it provided accurate information about the gap between Al3Li and AlLi solvus
lines. Finally, the influence of the vibrational entropy on the correct
prediction of the phase diagram is discussed. Overall, the methodology shows
that accurate phase diagrams of alloys of technological interest can be
predicted from first principles calculations.

Soft particulate gels include materials we can eat, squeeze, or 3D print.
From foods to bio-inks to cement hydrates, these gels are composed of a small
amount of particulate matter (proteins, polymers, colloidal particles, or
agglomerates of various origins) embedded in a continuous fluid phase. The
solid components assemble to form a porous matrix, providing rigidity and
control of the mechanical response, despite being the minority constituent. The
rheological response and gel elasticity are direct functions of the particle
volume fraction $\phi$: however, the diverse range of different functional
dependencies reported experimentally has, to date, challenged efforts to
identify general scaling laws. Here we reveal a hidden hierarchical
organization of fractal elements that controls the viscoelastic spectrum, and
which is associated with the spatial heterogeneity of the solid matrix
topology. The fractal elements form the foundations of a viscoelastic master
curve, which we construct using large-scale 3D microscopic simulations of model
gels, and can be described by a recursive rheological ladder model over a range
of particle volume fractions and gelation rates. The hierarchy of the fractal
elements provides the missing general framework required to predict the gel
elasticity and the viscoelastic response of these ubiquitous complex materials.

<br>
<br>
Electronic transport in the $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ model of pseudospin-1
fermions with a finite gap is studied within the semiclassical Boltzmann
approximation. We show that coupling of the orbital magnetic moment to the
external magnetic field, which is otherwise absent in the massless model,
breaks valley symmetry, results in finite and measurable corrections to the
longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and yields anomalous Hall conductivity due
to the Berry curvature. We also show that, remarkably, magnetoresistance
induced by the orbital magnetic moment can be either positive or negative; the
sign depends on the amount of disorder, and is different for both conventional
and anomalous contributions to the magnetoresistance. Recent material advances
and upcoming experiments on cold atoms that may realize pseudospin-1 fermions
makes our study timely and appropriate.

The spin and lattice dynamics of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle are studied via
molecular dynamics and with semi-classical spin dynamics simulations where spin
and lattice degrees of freedom are coupled via a dynamic uniaxial anisotropy
term. We show that this model conserves total angular momentum, whereas spin
and lattice angular momentum are not conserved. We carry out simulations of the
the Einstein-de Haas effect for a Fe nanocluster with more than 500 atoms that
is free to rotate, using a modified version of the open-source spinlattice
dynamics code (SPILADY). We show that the rate of angular momentum transfer
between spin and lattice is proportional to the strength of the magnetic
anisotropy interaction. The addition of the anisotropy allows full spin-lattice
relaxation to be achieved on previously reported timescales of \sim 100 ps and
for tight-binding magnetic anisotropy energies comparable to those of small Fe
nanoclusters.

<br>
<i>Adam H. Walker, Chris J. Pickard, Andrew G. Green</i>
<br>
<br>
Density functional theory in the local or semi-local density approximation is
a powerful tool for materials simulation, yet it struggles in many cases to
describe collective electronic order that is driven by electronic interactions.
In this work it is shown how arbitrary, fluctuation-driven electronic order may
be introduced into density functional theory using the quantum
order-by-disorder framework. This is a method of calculating the free energy
correction due to collective spin and charge fluctuations about a state that
hosts static order, in a self-consistent manner. In practical terms, the
quantum order-by-disorder method is applied to the Kohn-Sham auxiliary system
of density functional theory to give an order-dependent correction to the
exchange-correlation functional. Calculation of fluctuation propagators within
density functional theory renders the result fully first-principles. Two types
of order are considered as examples -- fluctuation-driven superconductivity and
spin nematic order -- and implementation schemes are presented in each case.

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear dynamics can give rise, via the processes of self-organisation and
pattern formation, to the spontaneous manifestation of order in open and
complex systems far from equilibrium. Self-organising systems, transforming the
inflow of energy into information, are ubiquitously found in current topical
areas of science ranging from brainwave entrainment and neuromorphic computing
to energy-efficient data storage technologies. In the latter, magnetic
materials play a pivotal role combining very fast switching with permanent
retention of information. However, it has been shown that, at very short time
scales, magnetisation dynamics become chaotic due to internal instabilities,
resulting in incoherent spin-wave excitations that ultimately destroy magnetic
ordering. Here, contrary to all expectations, we show that such chaos gives
rise to a periodic pattern of reversed magnetic domains, with a feature size
far smaller than the spatial extent of the excitation. We explain this pattern
as a result of phase-synchronisation of magnon-polaron waves, driven by strong
coupling of magnetic and elastic modes. Our results reveal not only the
peculiar formation and evolution of magnon-polarons at short time-scales, but
also present a novel mechanism of magnetization reversal driven by coherent
packets of short-wavelength quasiparticles.

<h3>Non-Kitaev vs. Kitaev Honeycomb Cobaltates</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, honeycomb cobaltates with 3$d^7$ were proposed to display Kitaev
physics despite weak spin-orbit coupling. However, other theoretical and
experimental works found leading XXZ Heisenberg and negligible Kitaev
interactions in the rhombohedral cobaltates, which calls for a further study to
clarify the origin of the discrepancies. Here we derive the analytical
expressions of the spin model using strong-coupling perturbation theory. With
typical tight binding parameters obtained by {\it ab-initio} calculations for
the ideal honeycomb lattice, we find that the largest intraorbital
$t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ exchange path, which was assumed to be small in the earlier
Kitaev cobaltate proposal, leads to a ferromagnetic (FM) Heisenberg
interaction. This becomes the dominant Heisenberg interaction, as other
$t_{2g}-e_g$ and $e_g-e_g$ contributions almost cancel each other. Exactly the
same assumed-to-be-small channel also generates an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
Kitaev interaction, which then cancels a FM Kitaev interaction from
$t_{2g}-e_g$ paths, resulting in a small Kitaev interaction. Under the trigonal
distortion, the preeminent isotropic Heisenberg becomes an anisotropic XXZ
model as expected. Applying our theory to BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$, the dominant
FM XXZ interaction is found. A way to achieve the Kitaev cobaltates is also
discussed.

<h3>Perspective on Reversible to Irreversible Transitions in Periodic Driven  Many Body Systems and Future Directions For Classical and Quantum Systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Reversible to irreversible (R-IR) transitions arise in numerous periodically
driven collectively interacting systems that, after a certain number of driving
cycles, organize into a reversible state where the particle trajectories
repeat, or remain irreversible with chaotic motion. R-IR transitions were first
systematically studied for periodically sheared dilute colloids, and appear in
a wide variety of both soft and hard matter systems, including amorphous
solids, crystals, vortices in type-II superconductors, and magnetic textures.
In some cases, the reversible transition is an absorbing phase transition with
a critical divergence in the organization time scale. R-IR systems can store
multiple memories and exhibit return point memory. We give an overview of R-IR
transitions including recent advances in the field, and discuss how the general
framework of R-IR transitions could be applied to a much broader class of
periodically driven nonequilibrium systems, including soft and hard condensed
matter systems, astrophysics, biological systems, and social systems. Some
likely candidate systems are commensurate-incommensurate states, systems
exhibiting hysteresis or avalanches, and nonequilibrium pattern forming states.
Periodic driving could be applied to hard condensed matter systems to see if
R-IR transitions occur in metal-insulator transitions, semiconductors, electron
glasses, electron nematics, cold atom systems, or Bose-Einstein condensates.
R-IR transitions could also be examined in dynamical systems where
synchronization or phase locking occurs. We discuss the use of complex periodic
driving such as changing drive directions or multiple frequencies as a method
to retain complex multiple memories. Finally, we describe features of classical
and quantum time crystals that could suggest the occurrence of R-IR transitions
in these systems.

Inspired by the observation of a robust $d$-wave superconducting phase driven
by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) electron hopping in recent density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies of six- and eight-leg $t$-$J$
model, we systematically study the phase diagram of the two-leg $t$-$J$ ladder
with the NNN couplings (including NNN hopping and spin interaction) in a large
region of doping level, by means of the DMRG calculations. Upon doping from
half filling, we identify the Luther-Emery liquid (LEL) phase, which can be
distinguished as the pairing-dominant and charge density-dominant regime by
comparing the Luttinger parameter $K_{\rho}$. With the growing NNN couplings,
pairing correlations are enhanced and correspondingly $K_{\rho}$ increases,
driving the system from the density-dominant to the pairing-dominant regime. In
the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) phase in the larger doping region, we
identify two TLL regimes with different features of charge density correlation.
At the quarter filling ($1/2$ doping level), we find that the strong dimer
orders of bond energy in the open system actually decay algebraically and thus
do not indicate a spontaneous translational symmetry breaking. Our results show
that in the LEL phase of the two-leg ladder, the NNN couplings seem to play the
similar role as that on the wider $t$-$J$ cylinder, and studies on this more
accessible system can be helpful towards understanding the emergence of the
remarkable $d$-wave superconducting phase on the wider system.
