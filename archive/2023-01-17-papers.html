<h3>Rectified Rotational Dynamics of Mobile Inclusions in Two-Dimensional  Active Nematics</h3>

We investigate the dynamics of mobile inclusions embedded in 2D active
nematics. The interplay between the inclusion shape, the boundary-induced
nematic order, and the autonomous flow powers the inclusion motion. Disks and
achiral gears exhibit unbiased rotational motion, but with distinct dynamics.
In comparison, chiral gear-shaped inclusions exhibit long-term rectified
rotation, which is correlated with dynamics and polarization of nearby +1/2
topological defects. The chirality of defect polarities and the active nematic
texture around the inclusion correlate with the inclusion's instantaneous
rotationr ate. Inclusions provide a promising tool for probing the rheological
properties of active nematics and extracting ordered motion from the inherently
chaotic motion of active nematics.

<h3>Effects of quantum recoil forces in resistive switching in memristors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06066</a>

Memristive devices, whose resistance can be controlled by applying a voltage
and further retained, are attractive as possible circuit elements for
neuromorphic computing. This new type of devices poses a number of both
technological and theoretical challenges. Even the very physical mechanisms of
the key process of resistive switching, usually associated with formation or
breakage of conductive filaments in the memristor, are not completely
understood yet. This work proposes an ingredient, which is expected to be
important for resistive switching in the thin-filament regime. Namely, we
discuss the electron recoil effect for a quantum current through a conductive
nanofilament on its geometry, comparing it with the transmission probability of
charge carriers. The quantum recoil is pronounced for thinnest filaments, which
are only several atoms thick and demonstrate a quasi-ballistic, quantized
conductance. Recoil effects are expected to "select" the filament geometries
with the transmittance close to unity, resulting in longer lifetimes of such
filaments and thus making the conductance quantization more observable even at
room temperature. We propose a mean-field theory of the quantum recoil forces
based on nonequilibrium Green's functions and demonstrate the recoil-driven
filament (de)stabilization effect on a simple but analytically tractable 1D
atomic chain and on a molecular-dynamics simulation of a copper filament. The
results obtained are expected to add to the understanding of resistive
switching mechanisms at the nanoscale and to help downscale high-retention
memristive devices.

Zinc nitride films were synthesized by reactive radio frequency (rf)
magnetron sputtering of a zinc target using an Ar+N2 mixture. The as-deposited
films were annealed in the air and O2 at 300 {\deg}C for 1 hr. The XRD
measurements indicated that the films had a polycrystalline structure with a
preferred (400) Zn3N2 orientation. The annealing process enhanced the
crystallinity. After annealing, the AFM and SEM morphology revealed no
significant change in the surface morphology and surface roughness. The direct
bandgap of Zn3N2 was estimated to be in the range of 1.15 -1.35 eV where
annealing resulted in a reduction of the bandgap. The films were confirmed to
be p-type conduction and the resistivity was slightly increased by annealing.
The photoconductivity measurements indicated that the as-deposited films did
not have any photoresponse, whereas the annealed films exhibited
photoconductivity.

<h3>Unconventional criticality, scaling breakdown, and diverse universality  classes in the Wilson-Cowan model of neural dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06839" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06839</a>

<br>
<br>
The Wilson-Cowan model constitutes a paradigmatic approach to understanding
the collective dynamics of networks of excitatory and inhibitory units. It has
been profusely used in the literature to analyze the possible phases of neural
networks at a mean-field level, e.g., assuming large fully-connected networks.
Moreover, its stochastic counterpart allows one to study fluctuation-induced
phenomena, such as avalanches. Here, we revisit the stochastic Wilson-Cowan
model paying special attention to the possible phase transitions between
quiescent and active phases. We unveil eight possible types of phase
transitions, including continuous ones with scaling behavior belonging to known
universality classes -- such as directed percolation and tricritical directed
percolation -- as well as novel ones. In particular, we show that under some
special circumstances, at a so-called Hopf tricritical directed percolation
transition, rather unconventional behavior including an anomalous breakdown of
scaling emerges. These results broaden our knowledge of the possible types of
critical behavior in networks of excitatory and inhibitory units and are of
relevance to understanding avalanche dynamics in actual neuronal recordings.
From a more general perspective, these results help extend the theory of
non-equilibrium phase transitions into quiescent or absorbing states.

<h3>Distilling Accurate Descriptors from Multi-Source Experimental Data for  Discovering Highly Active Perovskite OER Catalysts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06884</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Perovskite oxides are promising catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction
(OER), yet the huge chemical space remains largely unexplored due to the lack
of effective approaches. Here, we report the distilling of accurate descriptors
from multi-source experimental data for accelerated catalysts discovery by
using the new method SCMT-SISSO that overcomes the challenge of data
inconsistency between different sources. While many previous descriptors for
the catalytic activity were proposed based on respective small datasets, we
obtained the new 2D descriptor (d_B, n_B) based on 13 experimental datasets
collected from different publications and the SCMT-SISSO. Great universality
and predictive accuracy, and the bulk-surface correspondence, of this
descriptor have been demonstrated. With this descriptor, hundreds of unreported
candidate perovskites with activity greater than the benchmark catalyst
Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 were identified from a large chemical space. Our
experimental validations on five candidates confirmed the three highly active
new perovskite catalysts SrCo0.6Ni0.4O3, Rb0.1Sr0.9Co0.7Fe0.3O3, and
Cs0.1Sr0.9Co0.4Fe0.6O3.

<h3>All-optical magneto-thermo-elastic skyrmion motion</h3>

It is predicted magnetic skyrmions can be controllably moved on surfaces
using a focused laser beam. Here an absorbed power of the order 1 mW, focused
to a spot-size of the order 10 $\mu$m, results in a local temperature increase
of around 50 K, and a local perpendicular strain of the order 10$^{-3}$ due to
the thermo-elastic effect. For positive magneto-elastic coupling this generates
a strong attractive force on skyrmions due to the magneto-elastic effect. The
resultant motion is dependent on forces due to i) gradients in the local
strain-induced magnetic anisotropy, ii) gradients in the effective anisotropy
due to local temperature gradients, and magnetic parameters temperature
dependences, and iii) Magnus effect acting on objects with non-zero topological
number. Using dynamical magneto-thermo-elastic modelling, it is predicted
skyrmions can be moved with significant velocities (up to 80 m/s shown), both
for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic skyrmions, even in the presence of
surface roughness. This mechanism of controllably moving single skyrmions in
any direction, as well as addressing multiple skyrmions in a lattice, offers a
new approach to constructing and studying skyrmionic devices with all-optical
control.

<h3>Topological Quantum Dimers Emerging from Kitaev Spin Liquid Bilayer:  Anyon Condensation Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05721" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05721</a>

<i>Kyusung Hwang</i>

<br>
We present a bilayer spin model that illuminates the mechanism of topological
anyon condensation transition. Our model harbors two distinct topological
phases, Kitaev spin liquid bilayer state and resonating valence bond (RVB)
state connected by a continuous transition. We show that the transition occurs
by anyon condensation, and the hardcore dimer constraint of the RVB state plays
a role of the order parameter. This model study offers an intuitive picture for
anyon condensation transition, and is broadly applicable to generic
tri-coordinated lattices preserving the emergence of the RVB state from the
Kitaev bilayer.

<h3>A plane defect in the 3d O$(N)$ model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05728" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05728</a>
<br>
<i>Abijith Krishnan, Max A. Metlitski</i>
<br>
<br>
It was recently found that the classical 3d O$(N)$ model in the semi-infinite
geometry can exhibit an "extraordinary-log" boundary universality class, where
the spin-spin correlation function on the boundary falls off as $\langle
\vec{S}(x) \cdot \vec{S}(0)\rangle \sim \frac{1}{(\log x)^q}$. This
universality class exists for a range $2 \leq N < N_c$ {and Monte-Carlo
simulations and conformal bootstrap} indicate $N_c > 3$. In this work, we
extend this result to the 3d O$(N)$ model in an infinite geometry with a plane
defect. We use renormalization group (RG) to show that in this case the
extraordinary-log universality class is present for any finite $N \ge 2$. We
additionally show, in agreement with our RG analysis, that the line of defect
fixed points which is present at $N = \infty$ is lifted to the ordinary,
special (no defect) and extraordinary-log universality classes by $1/N$
corrections. We study the `"central charge" $a$ for the $O(N)$ model in the
boundary and interface geometries and provide a non-trivial detailed check of
an $a$-theorem by Jensen and O'Bannon. Finally, we revisit the problem of the
O$(N)$ model in the semi-infinite geometry. We find evidence that at $N = N_c$
the extraordinary and special fixed points annihilate and only the ordinary
fixed point is left for $N > N_c$.

<h3>Nanoscale Sn off-centering behind low thermal conductivity in SnSe  thermoelectric</h3>

<br>
<br>
The local atomic structure of SnSe was characterized across its
orthorhmbic-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition using x-ray pair
distribution function analysis. Substantial Sn off-centering distortions
persist in the high symmetry high temperature phase, with symmetry different
from that of ordered distortions below the transition. The analysis implies
that the transition is neither order-disorder nor displacive, but rather a
complex crossover where the character of coupling changes from 3D-like at low
temperature to 2D-like at high temperature. Robust ferro-coupled SnSe
intra-layer distortions suggest a ferroelectric-like instability as the driving
force. Complex local Sn off-centering is integral to the ultra-low lattice
thermal conductivity mechanism in SnSe.

techniques as implemented in these codes and shows their implementation
strategies as a whole, aiming to be useful for the community. Some of the

<h3>Digest Ultrasonic Welding I: Localized Heating and Fuse Bonding</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05810" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05810</a>

This paper reports a new insight on the principle of ultrasonic welding
process. Physics of ultrasonic welding process is considered to be an inverse
process of shear band formation. Both ultrasonic welding and shear band
formation involve temperature rising due to localized plastic deformation.
During shear band formation, heat will lead to damage of materials, e.g.,
initiation of cracks inside materials. But heat generated in ultrasonic welding
process will bond two pieces or repair the cracks inside materials. Energy
directors used in ultrasonic welding process act as a trigger of localized
plastic deformation. Mathematically, We found out that heating generation
during ultrasonic welding process is similar to heating generation by electric
current.

The one dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 Heisenberg-Ising model, a prototype quantum
many-body system, has been intensively studied for many years. In this review,
after a short introduction on some basic concepts of group theory for the
octahedral group, a detailed pedagogical framework is laid down to derive the
low-energy effective Hamiltonian for the Co-based materials. The 1D spin-1/2
Heisenberg-Ising model is obtained when applying the analysis to quasi-1D
antiferromagnetic materials $\rm BaCo_2V_2O_8$ and $\rm SrCo_2V_2O_8$. After
the preparation, we review the theoretical progresses of a variety of novel
magnetic excitations and emergent physics in the 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg-Ising
model, and further summarize their recent experimental realizations.

<h3>Discovery of 2D materials using Transformer Network based Generative  Design</h3>

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have wide applications in superconductors,
quantum, and topological materials. However, their rational design is not well
established, and currently less than 6,000 experimentally synthesized 2D
materials have been reported. Recently, deep learning, data-mining, and density
functional theory (DFT)-based high-throughput calculations are widely performed
to discover potential new materials for diverse applications. Here we propose a
generative material design pipeline, namely material transformer
generator(MTG), for large-scale discovery of hypothetical 2D materials. We
train two 2D materials composition generators using self-learning neural
language models based on Transformers with and without transfer learning. The
models are then used to generate a large number of candidate 2D compositions,
which are fed to known 2D materials templates for crystal structure prediction.
Next, we performed DFT computations to study their thermodynamic stability
based on energy-above-hull and formation energy. We report four new
DFT-verified stable 2D materials with zero e-above-hull energies, including
NiCl$_4$, IrSBr, CuBr$_3$, and CoBrCl. Our work thus demonstrates the potential
of our MTG generative materials design pipeline in the discovery of novel 2D
materials and other functional materials.

<h3>Temperature dependence of (111) and (110) ceria surface energy</h3>

<br>
<br>
High temperature properties of ceria surfaces are important for many
applications. Here we report the temperature dependences of surface energy for
the (111) and (110) CeO2 obtained in the framework of the extended two-stage
upsampled thermodynamic integration using Langevin dynamics (TU-TILD). The
method was used together with machinelearning potentials called moment tensor
potentials (MTPs), which were fitted to the results of the ab initio MD
calculations for (111) and (110) CeO2 at different temperatures. The parameters
of MTPs training and fitting were tested and the optimal algorithm for the
ceria systems was proposed. We found that the temperature increases from 0 K to
2100 K led to the decrease of the Helmholtz free energy of (111) CeO2 from 0.78
J/m2 to 0.64 J/m2. The energy of (110) CeO2 dropped from 1.19 J/m2 at 0 K to
0.92 J/m2 at 1800 K. We show that it is important to take anharmonicity into
account as simple consideration of volume expansion gives wrong temperature
dependences of the surface energies.

Learning from nature has been a quest of humanity for millennia. While this
has taken the form of humans assessing natural designs such as bones, butterfly
wings, or spider webs, we can now achieve generating designs using advanced
computational algorithms. In this paper we report novel biologically inspired
designs of diatom structures, enabled using transformer neural networks, using
natural language models to learn, process and transfer insights across
manifestations. We illustrate a series of novel diatom-based designs and also
report a manufactured specimen, created using additive manufacturing. The
method applied here could be expanded to focus on other biological design cues,
implement a systematic optimization to meet certain design targets, and include
a hybrid set of material design sets.

<br>
Quantum materials with tunable correlated and/or topological electronic
states, such as the electronic Kagome lattice, provide an ideal platform to
study the exotic quantum properties. However, the real-space investigations on
the correlated electronic Kagome lattice have been rarely reported. Herein, we
report on the electronic Kagome lattice emerging in the correlated
charge-density-wave (CDW) state of 1T-TaS$_2$ at ~200 K via
variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (VT-STM). This emergent
Kagome lattice can be considered a fractional electron-filling superstructure
with reduced translational and rotational symmetries, confirmed by STM
measurements and density functional theory simulations. The characteristic band
structure and density of states of this electronic Kagome lattice are further
explored based on theoretical calculations. Our results demonstrate a
self-organized electronic Kagome lattice from the correlated CDW state via the
effective tuning parameter of temperature and provide a platform to directly
explore the interplay of correlated electrons and topological physics.

Complex systems are characterized by strong coupling between different
microscopic degrees of freedom. Photoexcitation of such materials can drive
them into new transient and long-lived hidden phases that may not have any
counterparts in equilibrium. By exploiting femtosecond time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we probe the photoinduced transient phase and the
recovery dynamics of the ground state in a complex material: the charge density
wave (CDW)- Mott insulator 1$T$-TaS$_2$. We reveal striking similarities
between the band structures of the transient phase, where the Mott electronic
order and CDW lattice order are suppressed, and the (equilibrium) structurally
undistorted metallic phase. Following the transient phase, we find that the
restoration of the Mott and CDW ordering begins around the same time. This
highlights that the Mott transition is tied to the CDW structural distortion,
although earlier studies have shown that the collapse of Mott and CDW phases
are decoupled from each other. Interestingly, as the suppressed order starts to
recover, a long-lived metastable phase emerges before the material recovers to
the ground state. Our results demonstrate that it is the CDW lattice order that
drives the material into this metastable phase, which is indeed a commensurate
CDW-Mott insulating phase but with a smaller CDW amplitude. Moreover, we find
that the long-lived state emerges only under strong photoexcitation and has no
evidence when the photoexcitation strength is weak.

<h3>Evidence of scale-free clusters of vegetation in tropical rainforests</h3>

Tropical rainforests exhibit a rich repertoire of spatial patterns emerging
from the intricate relationship between the microscopic interaction between
species. In particular, the distribution of vegetation clusters can shed much
light on the underlying process regulating the ecosystem. Analyzing the
distribution of vegetation clusters at different resolution scales, we show the
first robust evidence of scale-invariant clusters of vegetation, suggesting the
coexistence of multiple intertwined scales in the collective dynamics of
tropical rainforests. We use field data and computational simulations to
confirm our hypothesis proposing a predictor that could be of particular
interest to monitor the ecological resilience of the world's 'green lungs.'

<br>
The kagome-lattice crystal hosts various intriguing properties including the
frustrated magnetism, charge order, topological state, superconductivity and
correlated phenomena. To achieve high-performance kagome-lattice compounds for
electronic and spintronic applications, careful tuning of the band structure
would be desired. Here, the electronic structures of kagome-lattice crystal
Ni3In2S2 were investigated by transport measurements, angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy as well as ab initio calculations. The transport
measurements reveal Ni3In2S2 as a compensated semimetal with record-high
carrier mobility (~8683 cm2 V-1 S-1 and 7356 cm2 V-1 S-1 for holes and
electrons) and extreme magnetoresistance (15518% at 2 K and 13 T) among
kagome-lattice materials. These extraordinary properties are well explained by
its band structure with indirect gap, small electron/hole pockets and large
bandwidth of the 3d electrons of Ni on the kagome lattice. This work
demonstrates that the crystal field and doping serve as the key tuning knobs to
optimize the transport properties in kagome-lattice crystals. Our work provides
material basis and optimization routes for kagome-lattice semimetals as
electronics and spintronics applications.

Since the emergence of graphene, we have seen several proposals for the
realization of Landau lasers tunable over the terahertz frequency range. The
hope was that the non-equidistance of the Landau levels from Dirac fermions
would suppress the harmful non-radiative Auger recombination. Unfortunately,
even with this non-equidistance an unfavorable non-radiative process persists
in Landau-quantized graphene, and so far no cyclotron emission from Dirac
fermions has been reported. One way to eliminate this last non-radiative
process is to sufficiently modify the dispersion of the Landau levels by
opening a small gap in the linear band structure. A proven example of such
gapped graphene-like materials are HgTe quantum wells close to the topological
phase transition. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate Landau emission
from Dirac fermions in such HgTe quantum wells, where the emission is tunable
by both the magnetic field and the carrier concentration. Consequently, these
results represent an advance in the realization of terahertz Landau lasers
tunable by magnetic field and gate-voltage.

<h3>Sorting of multiple molecular species on cell membranes</h3>

Eukaryotic cells maintain their inner order by a hectic process of
distillation of molecular factors taking place on the surface of their lipid
membranes. To understand the properties of this molecular sorting process, a
physical model of the process has been recently proposed [arXiv:1811.06760],
based on (a) the phase separation of a single, initially dispersed molecular
species into spatially localized sorting domains on the lipid membrane, and (b)
domain-induced membrane bending leading to the nucleation of submicrometric
lipid vesicles, naturally enriched in the molecules of the engulfed sorting
domain. The analysis of the model has shown the existence of an optimal region
of parameter space where sorting is most efficient. Here, we extend the model
to account for the simultaneous distillation of a pool of distinct molecular
species. The mean time sorted molecules reside on the membrane is found to
increase with the heterogeneity of the pool (i.e., the number of distinct
molecular species sorted) according to a simple scaling law, and that a large
number of distinct molecular species can in principle be sorted in parallel on
a typical cell membrane region without significantly interfering with each
other. Moreover, sorting is found to be most efficient when distinct molecular
species have comparable homotypic affinities. We also consider how valence
(i.e., the average number of interacting neighbors of a molecule in a sorting
domain) affects the sorting process, finding that higher-valence molecules can
be sorted with greater efficiency than lower-valence molecules.

The Hatano-Nelson model is one of the most prototypical non-Hermitian models
that exhibit the intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases and the concomitant
skin effect. These unique non-Hermitian topological phenomena originate from
the Galilean transformation. Here, we extend such an idea to a broader range of
systems based on an imaginary boost deformation and identify the corresponding
energy-twisted boundary conditions. This imaginary boost deformation
complexifies spectral parameters of integrable models and can be implemented by
the coordinate Bethe ansatz. We apply the imaginary boost deformation to
several typical integrable models, including free fermions, the
Calogero-Sutherland model, and the XXZ model. We find the complex-spectral
winding in free fermion models in the periodic boundary conditions and the
non-Hermitian skin effect in the open boundary conditions. The interaction
effect is also shown in the two-particle spectrum of the XXZ model.

<h3>A dual-space classification scheme of spatial heterogeneities in 2D  monatomic supercooled liquids</h3>

Understanding the physics of supercooled liquids near glassy transition
remains one of the major challenges in condensed matter science. There has been
long recognized that supercooled liquids have spatially dynamical heterogeneity
whose dynamics in some regions of the sample could potentially be orders of
magnitude faster than the dynamics in other regions only a few nanometers away.
However, to identify such domain structures both structurally and
configurationally in a consistent fashion and the connection between structures
and dynamics remains elusive. A new approach to classify these spatial
heterogeneities of supercooled liquids is developed. Using average weighted
coordination numbers (WCNs) of particles as features for the Principle
Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture (GM) clustering, a representation
of the feature space to perform GM clustering is constructed after applying PCA
to WCNs. Nano-domains or aggregated clusters are found in configurational
(real) space by direct mapping the identities of clusters in the feature
(structural) space with some classification uncertainties. These uncertainties
can be improved by a co-learning strategy to transmit information between the
structural space and configurational space iteratively until convergence. The
domains are indeed found to be remarkably consistent in both spaces over long
times as well as measured to have heterogeneous dynamics. Using such a
classification scheme the order parameter time correlation function follows the
non-conserved order parameter scaling law, which indicates that such domains
are the result of liquid-liquid phase separation after quenching.

High-density magnetic memories are key components in spintronics, quantum
computing, and energy-efficient electronics. Reduced dimensionality and
magnetic domain stability at the nanoscale are essential for the
miniaturization of magnetic storage units. Yet, inducing magnetic order, and
selectively tuning spin-orbital coupling at specific locations have remained
challenging. Here we demonstrate the construction of switchable magnetic
nano-islands in a nonmagnetic matrix based on cobaltite homo-structures. The
magnetic and electronic states are laterally modified by epitaxial strain,
which is regionally controlled by freestanding membranes. Atomically sharp
grain boundaries isolate the crosstalk between magnetically distinct regions.
The minimal size of magnetic nano-islands reaches 35 nm in diameter, enabling
an areal density of 400 Gbit per inch square. Besides providing an ideal
platform for precisely controlled read and write schemes, this methodology can
enable scalable and patterned memories on silicon and flexible substrates for
various applications.

<h3>Quench Dynamics of Thermal Bose Gases Across Wide and Narrow Feshbach</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using high-temperature virial expansion, we study the quench dynamics of the
thermal Bose gases near a wide, narrow, and intermediate Feshbach resonance.
Our results show that the shallow bound state near Feshbach resonance leads to
interesting phenomena. Near the wide Feshbach resonance, the long-time
$\hat{n}_{\bf k}$ oscillates when the scattering length $a_{s}$ is quenched
from zero to large but with finite positive values. The oscillation frequency
$\omega=E_{\rm b}/\hbar$ with $E_{\rm b}$ being the binding energy. When
$a_{s}$ is quenched to infinity or negative value, the oscillation vanishes.
Near the narrow Feshbach resonance, the interaction should be characterized by
a two-channel model. When the background scattering length $a_{\rm
bg}\gtrsim\lambda$, there is an oscillation in the long-time dynamics, and the
frequency is determined by the energy of the shallow bound state in the open
channel. When $a_{\rm bg}<0$ or $0<a_{\rm bg}\ll\lambda$, there is no shallow
bound state in the open channel, hence no long-time oscillation. We check our
conclusion using some realistic systems, and the results are consistent with
our conclusion.

<br>
Recent advancement in laser technology has opened the path toward the
manipulation of functionalities in quantum materials by intense coherent light.
Here, we study three-dimensional (3D) Dirac electrons driven by circularly
polarized light (CPL), when the photon energy lies within the Dirac bands. As
an experimental realization of this setup, we irradiate a thin film sample of
elemental bismuth, which is a well-known semimetal hosting 3D Dirac electrons,
with mid-infrared CPL. We successfully observe the emergence of the anomalous
Hall effect (AHE) via terahertz Faraday rotation that is both
pump-helicity-dependent and instantaneous. We compare our experimental findings
with the results of Floquet theory, which is a powerful framework for analyzing
the electronic band structure driven by coherent light. The contribution from
the band structures near the one-photon resonant positions to the AHE shows a
field-strength dependence consistent with our experimental results. The
effective Hamiltonian on which we base our model calculations also implies that
a pair of "double Weyl points" emerge due to the CPL-induced hybridization
between the occupied and unoccupied 3D Dirac bands. Our findings shed light on
ultrafast control of material properties in nonlinear topological optics.

External-field driven energy-level discretization, such as Landau
quantization or Stark localization, is one of the most intriguing phenomena in
quantum systems. We investigate the emergence of the Wannier-Stark ladder
coming from the particle-hole continuum and the Stark shifts of the exciton
levels in one-dimensional Mott insulators under the dc electric field. The
discretized peak structure in the optical-conductivity spectra newly appears by
applying the dc electric field, and the positions of these peaks can be
reproduced from the energy levels of a simple effective model in the
strong-coupling regime. Our results not only pave the way to investigate the
dynamical properties of correlated many-body systems under the dc electric
field, but also suggest that Mott insulators can provide a platform for Stark
discretization.

In Hilbert space, the geometry of the quantum state is identified by the
quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and
real part is the quantum metric tensor. Here, we propose and experimentally
implement a complete Bloch state tomography to directly measure eigenfunction
of an optical Raman lattice for ultracold atoms. Through the measured
eigenfunction, the distribution of the complete QGT in the Brillouin zone is
reconstructed, with which the topological invariants are extracted by the Berry
curvature and the distances of quantum states in momentum space are measured by
the quantum metric tensor. Further, we experimentally test a predicted
inequality between the Berry curvature and quantum metric tensor, which reveals
a deep connection between topology and geometry.

Supersolid is a special state of matter with both superfluid properties and
spontaneous modulation of particle density. In this paper, we focus on the
supersolid stripe phase realized in a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein
condensate and explore the properties of a class of metastable supersolids. In
particular, we study a one-dimensional supersolid whose characteristic wave
number $k$ (magnitude of wave vector) deviates from $k_{m}$, i.e., the one at
ground state. In other words, the period of density modulation is shorter or
longer than the one at ground state. We find that this class of supersolids can
still be stable if their wave numbers fall in the range $k_{c1}<k<k_{c2}$, with
two thresholds $k_{c1}$ and $k_{c2}$. Stripes with $k$ outside this range
suffer from dynamical instability with complex Bogoliubov excitation spectrum
at long wavelength. Experimentally, these stripes with $k$ away from $k_m$ are
accessible by exciting the longitudinal spin dipole mode, resulting in temporal
oscillation of stripe period as well as $k$. Within the mean-field
Gross-Pitaevskii theory, we numerically confirm that for a large enough
amplitude of spin dipole oscillation, the stripe states become unstable through
breaking periodicity, in qualitative agreement with the existence of thresholds
of $k$ for stable stripes. Our work extends the concept of supersolid and
uncovers a new class of metastable supersolids to explore.

<h3>Instability in the quantum restart problem</h3>

<br>
<i>Ruoyu Yin, Eli Barkai</i>
<br>
<br>
We study optimal restart times for the quantum first hitting time problem.
Using a monitored one-dimensional lattice quantum walk with restarts, we find
an instability absent in the corresponding classical problem. This instability
implies that a small change in parameters can lead to a rather large change of
the optimal restart time. We show that the optimal restart time versus a
control parameter, exhibits sets of staircases and plunges. The plunges, are
due to the mentioned instability, which in turn is related to the quantum
oscillation of the first hitting time probability, in the absence of restarts.
Furthermore, we prove that there are only two patterns of the staircase
structures, dependent on the parity of the distance between the target and
source in units of lattice constant.

<br>
<br>
In many biomolecular solutions, multivalent interactions that promote
complexation lead to phase separation at high concentrations. Here we study a
model biomolecular system that exhibits the opposite behavior: Self-assembly
into multisubunit complexes inhibits phase separation, even though the same
intermolecular interactions underlie both processes. We use microfluidics-based
experiments to show that DNA nanostars, which are known to phase separate at
low temperatures, can also phase separate upon disassembly at high temperatures
and high concentrations of divalent cations. We introduce a theoretical model
that quantitatively reproduces this novel re-entrant phase behavior, providing
a unified view of the competition between self-assembly and phase separation in
biomolecular solutions.

<h3>Anisotropic angle-dependent Andreev reflection at the  ferromagnet/superconductor junction on the surface of topological insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically demonstrate that a ferromagnetic/superconductor junction on
the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TIs) has an
anisotropic angle-dependent Andreev reflection when the in-plane magnetization
has a component perpendicular to the junction. In the presence of in-plane
magnetization, the Dirac cone's location adjusts in the $k$-space, whereas its
out-of-plane component induces a gap. This movement leads to the anisotropic
angle-dependent Andreev reflection and creates transverse conductance flows
parallel to the interface. Also, an indirect gap induces in the junction, which
removes the transport signatures of Majorana bound states. Because of the full
spin-momentum locking of Dirac fermions on the surface of 3DTIs, a torque that
called \textit{Andreev Transfer Torque} (ATT) imposes on the junction.
Moreover, we propose a setup to detect them experimentally.

Low-dimensional materials synthesis based on phosphorus atoms is under
intense study, and it is still one of the big challenges. Phosphorene, a
monolayer of black phosphorus, is one of the most promising candidates for
transistor and photonics devices at atomistic thickness. However, the lack of
large-scale and defects-free growth significantly obstructs its device
development. Here, we demonstrate the large-scale and defect-free phosphorene
synthesis on Nickel (Ni) substrate. In addition, the effect of substrate
orientation on the controllable synthesis of possible allotropes has also been
described. We have shown that blue phosphorene can be grown on Ni (111) and Ni
(100). While {\gamma}-Phosphorene, named Navy Phosphorene hereafter, can be
grown on Ni (110). Furthermore, we found that the synthesis goes through
phosphorus pentamers (P5) to phosphorene; P5 is a vital precursor for
phosphorene synthesis. Moreover, we confirm the high accuracy of the P-Ni, and
P-P potentials and show that the molecular dynamics (M.D.) approach is a
powerful tool to simulate the 2D materials synthesis in the vapor phase. This
work provides a solid reference to understand and control the synthesis of
large-area single-crystalline monolayer phosphorene.

<h3>Periodic Bootstrap Embedding</h3>

<i>Oinam Romesh Meitei, Troy Van Voorhis</i>
<br>
<br>
Bootstrap embedding (BE) is a recently developed electronic structure method
that has shown great success at treating electron correlation in molecules.
Here, we extend BE to treat surfaces and solids where the wave function is
represented in periodic boundary conditions using reciprocal space sums (i.e.
$k$-point sampling). The major benefit of this approach is that the resulting
fragment Hamiltonians carry no explicit dependence on the reciprocal space
sums, allowing one to apply traditional non-periodic electronic structure codes
to the fragments even though the entire system requires careful consideration
of periodic boundary conditions. Using coupled cluster singles and doubles
(CCSD) as an example method to solve the fragment Hamiltonians, we present
minimal basis set CCSD-in-HF results on 1D conducting polymers. We show that
periodic BE-CCSD can typically recover $\sim$99.9% of the electron correlation
energy. We further demonstrate that periodic BE-CCSD is feasible even for
complex donor-acceptor polymers of interest to organic solar cells - despite
the fact that the monomers are sufficiently large that even a $\Gamma-$point
periodic CCSD calculation is prohibitive. We conclude that BE is a promising
new tool for applying molecular electronic structure tools to solids and
interfaces.

Experiments have shown that the conductance of conical channels, filled with
an aqueous electrolyte, can strongly depend on the history of the applied
voltage. These channels hence have a memory and are promising elements in
brain-inspired (iontronic) circuits. We show here that the memory of such
channels stems from transient concentration polarization over the ionic
diffusion time. We derive an analytic approximation for these dynamics which
shows good agreement with full finite-element calculations. Using our analytic
approximation, we propose an experimentally realisable Hodgkin-Huxley iontronic
circuit where micrometer cones take on the role of sodium and potassium
channels. Our proposed circuit exhibits key features of neuronal communication
such as all-or-none action potentials upon a pulse stimulus and a spike train
upon a sustained stimulus.

Motivated by recent experiments on pump-induced polar ordering in the quantum
paraelectric SrTiO$_3$, we study a driven phonon system close to a second order
phase transition. Analyzing its classical dynamics, we find that sufficiently
strong driving leads to transitions into polar phases whose structures,
determined by the light polarization, are not all accessible in equilibrium. In
addition, for certain intensity profiles we demonstrate the possibility of
two-step transitions as a function of fluence. For even stronger field
intensities, the possibility of period-doubling and chaotic behavior is
demonstrated. Finally we develop a generalized formalism that allows us to
consider quantum corrections to the classical dynamics in a systematic fashion.
We predict a shift in the critical pump fluence due to quantum fluctuations
with a characteristic dependence on the fluence increase rate, which can be
observed in experiments.

Electron-hole pair excitations in semiconductors have been predicted to be
able to give rise to a highly correlated many-body ground state, the excitonic
insulator (EI). Under appropriate conditions below a critical temperature (Tc),
strongly bound electron-hole pairs spontaneously form and undergo a phase
transition from a normal band insulator into an exciton condensate,
transforming the parent material into a novel correlated insulator. Despite
recent advances in spectroscopic tools, clear direct experimental evidence for
the EI state has been elusive and is often obfuscated by accompanying
electronic effects. Here we present the reticular bottom-up synthesis of a
Kagome lattice of [4]triangulene, a two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic
framework (COF) imbued with a deliberate excitonic instability excitons with
binding energies larger than the bandgap arising from a pair of flat bands
(FBs). Theoretical analyses based on first-principles calculations and scanning
tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) reveal quasiparticle spectral signatures mixing
valence (VB) and conduction (CB) characteristics of the FBs along with a
non-trivial semiconducting gap that can only be explained by invoking many-body
theory. Our findings spectroscopically corroborate the nature of a FB induced
exciton insulator ground state and provide a robust yet highly tuneable
platform for the exploration of correlated quasi boson physics in quantum
materials.

<br>
<br>
Heterogeneous superconductivity onset is a common phenomenon in high-Tc
superconductors, both of cuprate and iron-based families. It is revealed by a
rather broad transition from metallic to zero-resistance state. Usually, in
these strongly anisotropic materials superconductivity (SC) first emerges in
the form of isolated domains. It results to anisotropic excess conductivity
above Tc, and the transport measurements give valuable information about the SC
domain structure deep inside the sample. In bulk samples this anisotropic SC
onset gives an averaged approximate shape of SC grains, but in thin samples it
also suggests the averaged SC grain size. In this paper both interlayer and
intralayer resistivity is measured as a function of temperature in FeSe samples
of various thickness. To measure the interlayer resistivity microbridges of
FeSe are produced using FIB. A considerable raise of superconducting transition
temperature Tc is observed as the sample thickness decreases: Tc raises from 8
K in bulk material to 12 K in microbridges of thickness 40 nm. We apply
analytical and numerical calculations to analyze these and earlier data and
find the SC domain aspect ratio and size in FeSe consistent with our
resistivity and diamagnetic response measurements. We propose a simple and
rather precise method of estimating the SC domain aspect ratio from Tc
anisotropy in samples of various small thickness. The relationship between
nematic and superconducting domains in FeSe is discussed. We also generalized
the analytical formulas for conductivity in heterogeneous anisotropic
superconductors for the case of elongated SC domains of two perpendicular
orientations with equal volume fractions, corresponding to nematic domain
structure in various Fe-based superconductors.

The existence of intrinsic vacancies in cubic (monoclinic) TiO suggests
opportunity for hydrogen absorption, which was addressed in recent experiments.
In the present work, based on first principle calculations, the preferences are
studied for the hydrogen absorption sites and diffusion paths between them. The
oxygen vacancies are found to be primary hydrogen traps with absorption energy
of -2.87 eV. The plausible channels for hydrogen diffusion between adjacent
vacancy sites (ordered in the monoclinic TiO structure) are compared with the
help of calculations done with the nudge elastic band method. Several
competitive channels are identified, with barrier heights varying from 2.87 to
3.71 eV, that is high enough to ensure relative stability of trapped hydrogen
atoms at oxygen vacancy sites. Moreover, the possibility of adsorption of
molecular hydrogen was tested and found improbable, in the sense that the H2
molecules penetrating the TiO crystal are easily dissociated (and released
atoms tend to proceed towards oxygen vacancy sites). These results suggest that
hydrogen may persist in oxygen vacancy sites up to high enough temperatures.

Bridging functionalities in periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) enable
new functionalities for a wide range of applications. Bridge cleavage is
frequently observed during anneals required to form porous structures, yet the
mechanism of these bridge cleavages has not been completely resolved. Here, we
reveal these chemical transformations and their kinetic pathways on
sub-millisecond timescales induced by laser heating. By varying anneal times
and temperatures, the transformation dynamics of bridge cleavage and structural
transformations, and their activation energies, are determined. The structural
relaxation time for individual reactions and their effective local heating time
are determined and compared, and results directly demonstrate the manipulation
of different molecules through kinetic control of the sequence of reactions. By
isolating and understanding the earliest stage of structural transformations,
this study identifies the kinetic principles for new synthesis and
post-processing routes to control individual molecules and reactions in PMOs
and other material systems with multi-functionalities.

The vibrational density of states of glasses is considerably different from
that of crystals. In particular, there exist spatially localized vibrational
modes in glasses. The density of states of these non-phononic modes has been
observed to follow $g(\omega) \propto \omega^4$, where $\omega$ is the
frequency. However, in two-dimensional systems, the abundance of phonons makes
it difficult to accurately determine this non-phononic density of states
because they are strongly coupled to non-phononic modes and yield strong
system-size and preparation-protocol dependencies. In this article, we utilize
the random pinning method to suppress phonons and disentangle their coupling
with non-phononic modes and successfully calculate their density of states as
$g(\omega) \propto \omega^4$. We also study their localization properties and
confirm that low-frequency non-phononic modes in pinned systems are truly
localized without far-field contributions. We finally discuss the excess
density of states over the Debye value that results from the hybridization of
phonons and non-phononic modes.

Recently, helicity-dependent photocurrent was reported in Bi single thin fi
lms. It is proposed that the origin of this photocurrent is the combination of
photo-spin conversion and spin-charge conversion effects in Bi and efficient
spin conversion in Bi is expected. In this study, we measured two types of
terahertz (THz) emissions from Bi/Co bilayer films induced by spin current
generation using laser-induced demagnetization of the Co layer and photo-spin
conversion effect in the Bi layer to investigate the spin current induced by
the two mechanisms simultaneously. We clearly observed diff erent Bi thickness
dependence of peak intensity and that of bandwidth for THz spin current in two
experiments, i.e., spin current induced by demagnetization of Co and that by
photo-spin conversion in Bi. The different Bi thickness dependence of spin
current intensity and bandwidth in two experiments is caused by different spin
relaxation properties of optically excited spin currents in Bi layers.

<br>
<br>
HfO$_{2}$-based ferroelectric thin films are promising for their application
in ferroelectric devices. Predicting the ultimate magnitude of polarization and
understanding its switching mechanism are critical to realize the optimal
performance of these devices. Here, a generalized solid-state variable cell
nudged elastic band (VCNEB) method is employed to predict the switching pathway
associated with domain-wall motion in (Hf, Zr)O$_{2}$ ferroelectrics. It is
found that the polarization reversal pathway where three-fold coordinated O
atoms passing across the nominal unit-cell boundaries through the Hf/Zr atomic
planes is energetically more favorable than the conventional pathway where the
O atoms do not pass through the Hf atomic planes. This finding implies the
polarization orientation in the orthorhombic Pca2$_{1}$ phase of HfO$_{2}$
being opposite to that normally assumed, predicts the spontaneous polarization
of about 70 ${\mu}$C/cm$^{2}$ being different from the commonly accepted value
by the polarization quantum 2ec/${\Omega}$, and foresees growth of
ferroelectric domains, in response to an applied electric field, structurally
reversed to those usually anticipated. These results provide important insights
into the understanding of ferroelectricity in HfO$_{2}$-based ferroelectrics.

A multifold Hopf semimetal is a topological point node semimetal possessing
an anisotropy in the internal electronic structure, e.g., the dipole structure
of the Berry curvature. In this paper, the unique features of threefold Hopf
semimetals in terms of the optical conductivity are theoretically investigated
with a minimal theoretical model by using linear response theory for a linearly
polarized photon. The frequency spectrum of the optical conductivity shows an
anisotropic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident photon even if
the electronic band structure is completely isotropic. The longitudinal optical
conductivity linearly depends on the photon frequency and possesses step-like
changes in the frequency spectrum. The anisotropic electronic structure has a
varying the number of steps with the orientation of the photon polarization
axis. We reveal that the anisotropy is attributed to symmetries preserving the
point node in threefold Hopf semimetals. The linearly polarized photon also
induces a Hall current but it vanishes with the photon polarization axis
parallel to the Berry dipole axis. The numerical calculations show that these
characteristic features can be observed even with a non-zero temperature and
disorder.

Fusing Majorana zero modes leads to multiple outcomes, a property being
unique to non-Abelian anyons. Successful demonstration of this nontrivial
fusion rule could serve as a smoking-gun evidence for its existence in
topological superconducting systems. Here we show that this can be done by
simply attaching a fermionic mode to a single Majorana zero mode. Our scheme
requires periodic modulations of the energy level of this fermionic mode as
well as its coupling with the Majorana mode. Adjusting the two quantities in
different sequences would correspond to fusions of Majorana modes in different
orders, ending up with distinct charge transfer process, which is detectable
through charge sensing method or current measurement. Moreover, the charge
transfer would experience an abrupt change with the same operations in the
presence of trivial Andreev bound states. This provides a feasible way to
distinguish Majorana modes from trivial Andreev bound states. In the end, we
demonstrate our proposal in a nanowire-based topological superconductor coupled
to a quantum dot, where the dot level and coupling strength are tunable in
experiments.

The unique spin texture of quantum states in topological materials underpins
many proposed spintronic applications. However, realizations of such great
potential are stymied by perturbations, such as temperature and local fields
imposed by impurities and defects, that can render a promising quantum state
uncontrollable. Here, we report room-temperature observation of interaction
between Rashba states and topological surface states, which manifests unique
spin textures controllable by layer thickness of thin films. Specifically, we
combine scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with the first-principles
theoretical calculation to find the robust Rashba states coexisting with
topological surface states along the surface steps with characteristic spin
textures in momentum space. The Rashba edge states can be switched off by
reducing the thickness of a topological insulator Bi2Se3 to bolster their
interaction with the hybridized topological surface states. The study unveils a
manipulating mechanism of the spin textures at room temperature, reinforcing
the necessity of thin film technology in controlling quantum states.

Transport and magnetic properties along with high resolution valence band
photoemission study of disordered double perovskite Sr$_{2}$TiIrO$_{6}$ has
been investigated. Insulator to insulator transition along with a magnetic
transition concurrently occurs at 240 K. Comparison of valence band
photoemission with band structure calculations suggests that the spin orbit
coupling as well as electron correlation are necessary to capture the line
shape and width of the Ir 5$d$ band. Room temperature valence band
photoemission spectra show negligibly small intensity at Fermi energy, $E_{F}$.
Fermi cut-off is observed at low temperatures employing high resolution. The
spectral density of states at room temperature exhibits $|E-E_{F}|^{2}$ energy
dependence signifying the role of electron-electron interaction. This energy
dependence changes to $|E-E_{F}|^{3/2}$ below the magnetic transition
evidencing the role of electron-magnon coupling in magnetically ordered state.
The evolution of pseudogap ($\pm$12 meV) explains the sudden increase in
resistivity ($\rho$) below 50 K in this disordered system. The temperature
dependent spectral density of states at $E_{F}$ exhibiting $T^{1/2}$ behaviour
verifies Altshuler-Aronov theory for correlated disordered systems.

Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, or Cs) exhibit intriguing charge
density wave (CDW) instabilities, which interplay with superconductivity and
band topology. However, despite firm observations, the nature of the CDW phases
remains elusive. Here, by carrying out first-principles calculations and
developing an effective Hamiltonian of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we unravel a series of
CDW structures, including the established inverse star of David (ISD) phase and
a series of newly discovered D$_{3h}$-n states under mild tensile strains. With
the first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian, the emergence of the ISD and
D$_{3h}$-n states is explained as a result of competition of interactions of
the first-nearest neighbor V-V and V-Sb$_2$ pairs versus the second-nearest
neighbor V-V pairs. Moreover, a possible pattern is proposed for the mysterious
experimental 4$a_0$ phase. Band structures and scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) images are simulated to help distinguish between different CDW states.
Our work thus deepens the understanding of the CDW formation in AV$_3$Sb$_5$
and our method should be applicable to other CDW

<h3>Numerical Investigation of Localization in Two-Dimensional Quasiperiodic  Mosaic Lattice</h3>

A one-dimensional lattice model with mosaic quasiperiodic potential is found
to exhibit interesting localization properties, e.g., clear mobility edges [Y.
Wang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{125}, 196604 (2020)]. We generalize this
mosaic quasiperiodic model to a two-dimensional version, and numerically
investigate its localization properties: the phase diagram from the fractal
dimension of the wavefunction, the statistical and scaling properties of the
conductance. Compared with disordered systems, our model shares many common
features but also exhibits some different characteristics in the same
dimensionality and the same universality class. For example, the sharp peak at
$g\sim 0$ of the critical distribution and the large $g$ limit of the universal
scaling function $\beta$ resemble those behaviors of three-dimensional
disordered systems.

<h3>Orbital Magnetization under an Electric Field and Orbital  Magnetoelectric Polarizabilty for a Bilayer Chern System</h3>

In the the real space formalism of orbital magnetization (OM) for a Chern
insulator without an external electric field, it is correct to average the
local OM either over the bulk region or over the whole sample. However for a
layered Chern insulator in an external electric field, which is directly
related to the nontrivial nature of orbital magnetoelectric coupling, the role
of boundaries remains ambiguous in this formalism. Based on a bilayer model
with an adjustable Chern number at half filling, we numerically investigate the
OM with the above two different average types under a nonzero perpendicular
electric field. The result shows that in this case, the nonzero Chern number
gives rise to a gauge shift of the OM with the bulk region average, while this
gauge shift is absent for the OM with the whole sample average. This indicates
that only the whole sample average is reliable to calculate the OM under a
nonzero electric field for Chern insulators. On this basis, the orbital
magnetoelectric polarizablity (OMP) and the Chern-Simons orbital
magnetoelectric polarizablity (CSOMP) with the whole sample average are
studied. We also present the relationship between the OMP (CSOMP) and the
response of Berry curvature to the electric field. The stronger the response of
Berry curvature to electric field, the stronger is the OMP (CSOMP). Besides
clarify the calculation methods, our result also provides an effective method
to enhance OMP and CSOMP of materials.

<h3>Modular developing deep potential for complex solid solutions</h3>

The multicomponent oxide solid solution is a versatile platform to tune the
the delicate balance between competing spin, charge, orbital, and lattice
degrees of freedom for materials design and discovery. The development of
compositionally complex oxides with superior functional properties has been
largely empirical and serendipitous, in part due to the exceedingly complex
chemistry and structure of solid solutions that span a range of length scales.
The classical molecular dynamics (MD), as a powerful statistical method to
investigate materials properties over large spatial and temporal scales, often
plays a secondary role in computer-aided materials discovery because of the
limited availability and accuracy of classical force fields. Here, we introduce
the strategy of ``modular developing deep potential" (ModDP) that enables a
systematic development and improvement of deep neural network-based model
potential, termed as deep potential, for complex solid solutions with minimum
human intervention. The converged training database associated with an
end-member material is treated as an independent module and is reused to train
the deep potential of solid solutions via a concurrent learning procedure. We
apply ModDP to obtain classical force fields of two technologically important
solid solutions, Pb$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_3$ and Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$. For both
materials systems, a single model potential is capable of predicting various
properties of solid solutions including temperature-driven and
composition-driven phase transitions over a wide range of compositions. In
particular, the deep potential of Pb$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_3$ reproduces a few
known topological textures such as polar vortex lattice and electric dipole
waves in PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices, paving the way for MD
investigations on the dynamics of topological structures in response to
external stimuli.

<h3>Evidence of non-degenerated, non-reciprocal and ultra-fast spin-waves in  the canted antiferromagnet α-Fe2O3</h3>

Spin-waves in antiferromagnets hold the prospects for the development of
faster, less power-hungry electronics, as well as new physics based on
spin-superfluids and coherent magnon-condensates. For both these perspectives,
addressing electrically coherent antiferromagnetic spin-waves is of importance,
a prerequisite that has so far been elusive, because unlike ferromagnets,
antiferromagnets couple weakly to radiofrequency fields. Here, we demonstrate
the electrical detection of ultra-fast non-reciprocal spin-waves in the
dipolar-exchange regime of a canted antiferromagnet. Using time-of-flight
spin-wave spectroscopy on hematite (alpha-Fe2O3), we find that the magnon wave
packets can propagate as fast as 30 km/s for reciprocal bulk spin-wave modes
and up to 10 km/s for surface-spin waves propagating parallel to the
antiferromagnetic N\'eel vector. The electrical detection of coherent
non-reciprocal antiferromagnetic spin waves holds makes hematite a versatile
platform where most of the magnonic concepts developed for ferromagnet can be
adapted paving the way for the development antiferromagnetic and
altermagnet-based magnonic devices.

The magnetic order for several compositions of
CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ has been studied by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and neutron diffraction. Our observations for
the Mn-doped 1144 compound are consistent with the hedgehog spin vortex crystal
(hSVC) order which has previously been found for Ni-doped
$\text{Ca}\text{K}\text{Fe}_4\text{As}_4$. The hSVC state is characterized by
the stripe-type propagation vectors $(\pi\,0)$ and $(0\,\pi)$ just as in the
doped 122 compounds. The hSVC state preserves tetragonal symmetry at the Fe
site, and only this SVC motif with simple AFM stacking along $\textbf{c}$ is
consistent with all our observations using NMR, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and
neutron diffraction. We find that the hSVC state in the Mn-doped 1144 compound
coexists with superconductivity (SC), and by combining the neutron scattering
and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy data we can infer a quantum phase transition,
hidden under the superconducting dome, associated with the suppression of the
AFM transition temperature ($T_\text{N}$) to zero for $x\approx0.01$. In
addition, unlike several 122 compounds and Ni-doped 1144, the ordered magnetic
moment is not observed to decrease at temperatures below the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$).

<h3>Terahertz spin ratchet effect in magnetic metamaterials</h3>

We report on spin ratchet currents driven by terahertz radiation electric
fields in a Co/Pt magnetic metamaterial formed by triangle-shaped holes forming
an antidots lattice and subjected to an external magnetic field applied
perpendicularly to the metal film plane. We show that for a radiation
wavelength substantially larger than the period of the antidots array the
radiation causes a polarization-independent spin-polarized ratchet current. The
current is generated by the periodic asymmetric radiation intensity
distribution caused by the near-field diffraction at the edges of the antidots,
which induces spatially inhomogeneous periodic electron gas heating, and a
phase-shifted periodic asymmetric electrostatic force. The developed
microscopic theory shows that the magnetization of the Co/Pt film results in a
spin ratchet current caused by both the anomalous Hall and the anomalous Nernst
effects. Additionally, we observed a polarization-dependent trigonal spin
photocurrent, which is caused by the scattering of electrons at the antidot
boundaries resulting in a spin-polarized current due to the magnetization.
Microscopic theory of these effects reveals that the trigonal photocurrent is
generated at the boundaries of the triangle antidots, whereas the spin ratchet
is generated due to the spatially periodic temperature gradient over the whole
film. This difference causes substantially different hysteresis widths of these
two currents.

<h3>Truncated Wigner approximation for the bosonic model of large spin baths</h3>

The central spin model has a wide applicability, it is ideally suited to
describe a small quantum system, for instance a quantum bit, in contact to a
bath of spins, e.g., nuclear spins, or other small quantum systems in general.
According to previous work~[R\"ohrig \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 97},
165431 (2018)], a large bath of quantum spins can be described as a bath of
quantum harmonic oscillators. But the resulting quantum model is still far from
being straightforward solvable. Hence we consider a chain representation for
the bosonic degrees of freedom to study how well a truncated Wigner
approximation of the effective model of harmonic oscillators works in
comparison with other approximate and exact methods. Numerically, we examine
the effect of the number of bath spins and of the truncation level, i.e., the
chain length.

<h3>Charge 4e superconductivity and chiral metal in the $45^\circ$-twisted  bilayer cuprates and similar materials</h3>

The vestigial secondary-order phase above the $T_c$ of a multi-component
pairing state is a hot topic recently. Here we study the vestigial phases of a
class of materials made through stacking a homo-bilayer with the largest twist
angle, dubbed as the twist-bilayer quasi-crystal (TB-QC), exampled by the
$45^\circ$-twisted bilayer cuprates and $30^\circ$-twisted bilayer graphene.
When each mononlayer hosts a pairing state with the largest pairing angular
momentum, e.g. $d$-wave for the cuprates or $f$-wave for the graphene, previous
studies yield that the second-order interlayer Josephson coupling would drive
chiral $d+id$ or $f+if$ topological superconductivity (TSC) in the TB-QC. Here
we propose that, above the $T_c$ of the chiral TSC phase, either the total- or
relative- pairing phase of the two layers can be unilateral quasi-ordered or
ordered. In the form case, a Cooper pair from the top layer pairs with another
Cooper pair from the bottom layer to form the charge-4e SC; in the latter case,
a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral metal phase is formed. Based on a
thorough symmetry analysis, we arrive at the low-energy effective Hamiltonian
describing the pairing-phase fluctuations. Our combined renormalization group
and Monte-Carlo studies reveal the presence of the charge-4e SC and chiral
metal phases in certain regimes in the phase diagram. These vestigial phases
are characterized by various temperature-dependent quantities and
spatial-dependent correlations.

<h3>Clusters and collective motions in Brownian vibrators</h3>

Using Brownian vibrators, where single particles can undergo Brownian motion
under vibration, we experimentally investigated self-organized structures and
dynamics of quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2d) granular materials with volume
fractions $0.111\le\phi\le0.832$. We show rich structures and dynamics in
hard-disk systems of inelastic particle collisions, with four phases
corresponding to cluster fluid, collective fluid, poly-crystal, and crystal.
While poly-crystal and crystal are strikingly similar to the equilibrium hard
disks, the first two phases differ substantially from the equilibrium ones and
the previous quasi-2d experiments of uniformly driven spheres. Our
investigation provides single-particle-scale evidence that granular materials
subject to uniform random forcing are weakly cohesive with complex internal
structures and dynamics. Moreover, our experiment shows that large-scale
collective motion can arise in a purely repulsive hard-disk system. The
collective motion emerges near $\phi=0.317$, where the most significant
clusters span half of the system, and disappears near $\phi=0.713$, around
which the system crystallizes and the melting transition occurs in the
equilibrium hard disks.

tuned into a state of the lowest carrier concentration, we find a nearly linear

spectroscopy allows us to describe the system with a massive Dirac model,
giving a gap $2\Delta =32$~meV and an in-plane velocity parameter $v= 4.0\times

Gas-solid reactions are cornerstones of many catalytic and redox processes

of hydrogen-based iron oxide reduction is the foundation to render the global

largest single industrial emitter of carbon dioxide. Our perception of
gas-solid reactions has not only been limited by the availability of
state-of-the-art techniques which can delve into the reacted solids in great
structural and chemical detail, but we continue to miss an important reaction
partner that defines the thermodynamics and kinetics of gas phase reactions:
the gas molecules. In this investigation, we use the latest development in
cryogenic atom probe tomography to study the quasi in-situ evolution of gas
phase heavy water at iron-iron oxide interfaces resulting from the direct
reduction of iron oxide by deuterium gas at 700{\deg}C. The findings provide
new insights into the formation kinetics and location of water formed during

<br>
<br>
Whenever the elastic energy depends on magnetic field, there is
magnetostriction. Field-linear magnetostrictive response implies piezomagnetism
and vice versa. Here, we show that there is a large and almost perfectly linear
room-temperature magnetostriction in Mn$_3$Sn, a non-collinear antiferromanget
with Weyl nodes. Longitudinal magnetostriction is negative and isotropic
($\Lambda_{11}= \Lambda_{22} \approx - 1.5 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-5}$ T$^{-1}$)
and slightly larger than a transverse magnetostriction of opposite sign
($\Lambda_{12}= \Lambda_{21} \approx + 1.1 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-5}$ T$^{-1}$).
We argue that this is caused by the field-induced twist of spins. This
field-linear magnetostriction, which can be quantitatively accounted for by the
magnetic and elastic energy scales of the inter-twinned spin-lattice texture,
is three times larger than the recently measured piezomagnetic coefficient. We
find that the components of the piezomagnetic tensor, $\Lambda$, evolve with
variation in Mn excess. At the threshold magnetic field of domain nucleation
($B_0= 0.02 $ T), a second-order phase transition is identified by detecting a
jump in longitudinal magnetostriction. In a narrow field window, where the
magnetic field and the prevailing magnetic domain have opposite polarities,
competition between magnetic and elastic energies generate twisto-magnetic
stripes.

provided, together with its implementation in a fully automated framework. This
is accompanied by an automatic GW band interpolation scheme based on
maximally-localized Wannier functions, aiming at a reduction of the
computational burden of quasiparticle band structures while preserving high
accuracy. The proposed developments are validated on a set of representative

unconventional global symmetries that are characterized by the input category

Optically driven quantum materials exhibit a variety of non-equilibrium
functional phenomena [1-11], which are potentially associated with unique
transport properties. However, these transient electrical responses have
remained largely unexplored, primarily because of the challenges associated
with integrating quantum materials into ultrafast electrical devices. Here,
thin films of K3C60 grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy were connected by coplanar
terahertz waveguides to a series of photo-conductive switches. This geometry
enabled ultrafast transport measurements at high current densities, providing
new information on the photo-induced phase created in the high temperature
metal by mid-infrared excitation [12-16]. Nonlinearities in the current-voltage
charactersitics of the transient state validate the assignment of transient
superconductivity, and point to an inhomogeneous phase in which superconducting

We investigate the response to modular transformations and the fractional
statistics of Abelian multi-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. In
particular, we analytically derive the modular matrices encoding the statistics
of anyonic excitations for general Halperin states using the conformal field
theories (CFTs). We validate our theory by several microscopic examples,
including the spin-singlet state using anyon condensation picture and the
Halperin (221) state in a topological flat-band lattice model using numerical
calculations. Our results, uncovering that the modular matrices and associated
fractional statistics are solely determined by the $K$-matrix, further
strengthens the correspondence between the 2D CFTs and (2+1)D topological
orders for multi-component FQH states.

Polymorphic phases and collective phenomena - such as charge density waves
(CDWs) - in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) dictate the physical and
electronic properties of the material. Most TMDs naturally occur in a single
given phase, but the fine-tuning of growth conditions via methods like
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) allows to unlock otherwise inaccessible
polymorphic structures. Exploring and understanding the morphological and
electronic properties of new phases of TMDs is an essential step to enable
their exploitation in technological applications. Here, we use scanning
tunneling microscopy to map MBE-grown monolayer TaTe2. We report the first
observation of the 1H polymorphic phase, coexisting with the 1T, and
demonstrate that their relative coverage can be controlled by adjusting
synthesis parameters. Several super-periodic structures, compatible with CDWs,
are observed to coexist on the 1T phase. Finally, we provide theoretical
insight on the delicate balance between Te...Te and Ta-Ta interactions that
dictates the stability of the different phases. Our findings demonstrate that
TaTe2 is an ideal platform to investigate competing interactions, and indicate
that accurate tuning of growth conditions is key to accessing metastable states
in TMDs.

<h3>Towards strong evidence of Majorana bound state by a combined  measurement of tunneling conductance and current noise</h3>

Recently, hunting-Majorana community has reported the experimental
observations of nearly quantized conductance plateau and integer Fano factor:
both phenomena were believed as exclusive hallmarks of Majorana bound state.
Within a unified theoretical framework, we show that zero-energy Andreev bound
states can also generate both a nearly quantized conductance plateau, and an
integer Fano factor, in a sizable, continuous, yet topologically trivial
parameter space. Importantly, we further propose to obtain strong Majorana
evidence by a combined measurement of tunneling conductance and current noise.
Specifically, for a Majorana bound state and zero-energy Andreev bound state, a
nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peak always accompanies a zero-bias dip
and peak, respectively, of the differential current noise. This protocol,
designed for the simplest two-terminal device, can be practically implemented
in multiple MBS candidate platforms.

$^{23}$Na spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates are used to experimentally
demonstrate that mean-field physics beyond the single-mode approximation can be
relevant during the non-equilibrium dynamics. The experimentally observed spin
oscillation dynamics and associated dynamical spatial structure formation
confirm theoretical predictions that are derived by solving a set of coupled
mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equations [J. Jie et al., Phys. Rev. A 102, 023324
(2020)]. The experiments rely on microwave dressing of the $f=1$ hyperfine
states, where $f$ denotes the total angular momentum of the $^{23}$Na atom. The
fact that beyond single-mode approximation physics at the mean-field level,
i.e., spatial mean-field dynamics that distinguishes the spatial density
profiles associated with different Zeeman levels, can -- in certain parameter
regimes -- have a pronounced effect on the dynamics when the spin healing
length is comparable to or larger than the size of the Bose-Einstein condensate
has implications for using Bose-Einstein condensates as models for quantum
phase transitions and spin squeezing studies as well as for non-linear SU(1,1)
interferometers.

Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) based spin pumping is a versatile tool to
quantify the spin mixing conductance and spin to charge conversion (S2CC)
efficiency of ferromagnet/normal metal (FM/NM) heterostructure. The spin mixing
conductance of FM/NM interface can also be tuned by the crystal orientation
symmetry of epitaxial FM. In this work, we study the S2CC in epitaxial Bismuth
substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi0.1Y2.9Fe5O12) thin films Bi-YIG (100 nm)
interfaced with heavy metal platinum (Pt (8 nm)) deposited by pulsed laser
deposition process on different crystal orientation Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrates
i.e. [100] and [111]. The crystal structure and surface roughness characterized
by X-Ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy measurements establish
epitaxial Bi-YIG[100], Bi-YIG[111] orientations and atomically flat surfaces
respectively. The S2CC quantification has been realized by two complimentary
techniques, (i) FMR-based spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) at
GHz frequency and (ii) temperature dependent spin Seebeck measurements.
FMR-ISHE results demonstrate that the [111] oriented Bi-YIG/Pt sample shows
significantly higher values of spin mixing conductance ((2.31+-0.23)x10^18
m^-2) and spin Hall angle (0.01+-0.001) as compared to the [100] oriented
Bi-YIG/Pt. A longitudinal spin Seebeck measurement reveals that the [111]
oriented sample has higher spin Seebeck coefficient (106.40+-10 nV mm-1 K-1).
This anisotropic nature of spin mixing conductance and spin Seebeck coefficient
in [111] and [100] orientation has been discussed using the magnetic
environment elongation along the surface normal or parallel to the growth
direction. Our results aid in understanding the role of crystal orientation
symmetry in S2CC based spintronics devices.

<h3>Mapping quantum geometry and quantum phase transitions to real space by  a fidelity marker</h3>

<br>
<br>
The quantum geometry in the momentum space of semiconductors and insulators,
described by the quantum metric of the valence band Bloch state, has been an
intriguing issue owing to its connection to various material properties.
Because the Brillouin zone is periodic, the integration of quantum metric over
momentum space represents an average distance between neighboring Bloch states,
of which we call the fidelity number. We show that this number can further be
expressed in real space as a fidelity marker, which is a local quantity that
can be calculated directly from diagonalizing the lattice Hamiltonian. A linear
response theory is further introduced to generalize the fidelity number and
marker to finite temperature, and moreover demonstrates that they can be
measured from the global and local optical absorption power against linearly
polarized light. In particular, the fidelity number spectral function in 2D
systems can be easily measured from the opacity of the material. Based on the
divergence of quantum metric, a nonlocal fidelity marker is further introduced
and postulated as a universal indicator of any quantum phase transitions
provided the crystalline momentum remains a good quantum number, and it may be
interpreted as a Wannier state correlation function. The ubiquity of these
concepts is demonstrated for a variety of topological insulators and
topological phase transitions in different dimensions.

<br>
<br>
The long theorized two-dimensional allotrope of SiC has remained elusive amid
the exploration of graphenelike honeycomb structured monolayers. It is
anticipated to possess a large direct band gap (2.5 eV), ambient stability, and
chemical versatility. While $sp^{2}$ bonding between silicon and carbon is
energetically favorable, only disordered nanoflakes have been reported to date.
Here we demonstrate large-area, bottom-up synthesis of monocrystalline,
epitaxial monolayer honeycomb SiC atop ultrathin transition metal carbide films
on SiC substrates. We find the 2D phase of SiC to be almost planar and stable
at high temperatures, up to 1200{\deg}C in vacuum. Interactions between the
2D-SiC and the transition metal carbide surface result in a Dirac-like feature
in the electronic band structure, which in the case of a TaC substrate is
strongly spin-split. Our findings represent the first step towards routine and
tailored synthesis of 2D-SiC monolayers, and this novel heteroepitaxial system
may find diverse applications ranging from photovoltaics to topological
superconductivity.

Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic $3d$-transition metal
trihalides are a new class of functional materials showing exotic physical
properties useful for spintronic and memory storage applications. This letter
presents the synthesis and electromagnetic characterization of
single-crystalline vanadium trichloride, VCl$_3$, a novel 2D layered vdW Mott
insulator, which has a rhombohedral structure (R$\overline{3}$, No. 148) at
room temperature. VCl$_3$ undergoes a structural phase transition at 103 K and
a subsequent antiferromagnetic transition at 21.8 K. Combining core levels and
valence bands X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) with first-principles
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the Mott Hubbard
insulating nature of VCl$_3$ and the existence of electron small polarons
localized on V atom sites by V-Cl bond relaxation. The polarons strongly affect
the electromagnetic properties of VCl$_3$ promoting the occupation of
dispersion-less spin-polarized V-3d $a^{1}_{g}$ states and band inversion with
$e^{'}_{g}$ states. Within the polaronic scenario, it is possible to interpret
different experimental evidences on 2D vanadium trihalides, highlighting the
complex physical behavior determined by correlation effects, mixed valence
states, and magnetic states.

<br>
<br>
The in-plane structural anisotropy in low-symmetric layered compound rhenium
disulfide ($\text{ReS}_2$) makes it a candidate to host and tune
electromagnetic phenomena specific for anisotropic media. In particular,
optical anisotropy may lead to the appearance of hyperbolic plasmons, a highly
desired property in optoelectronics. The necessary condition is a strong
anisotropy of the principal components of the dielectric function, such that at
some frequency range, one component is negative and the other is positive,
i.e., one component is metallic, and the other one is dielectric. Here, we
study the effect of anisotropy in $\text{ReS}_2$ and show that it can be a
natural material to host hyperbolic plasmons in the ultraviolet frequency
range. The operating frequency range of the hyperbolic plasmons can be tuned
with the number of $\text{ReS}_2$ layers.

<h3>Giant Nernst effect in the crossover between Fermi liquid and strange  metal</h3>

<br>
The strange-metal state is a crucial problem in condensed matter physics
highlighted by its ubiquity in almost all major correlated systems[1-7]. Its
understanding could provide important insight into high-Tc superconductivity[2]
and quantum criticality[8]. However, with the Fermi liquid theory failing in
strange metals, understanding the highly unconventional behaviors has been a
long-standing challenge. Fundamental aspects of strange metals remain elusive,
including the nature of their charge carriers[1]. Here, we report the
observation of a giant Nernst response in the strange-metal state in a
two-dimensional superconductor 2M-WS2. A giant Nernst coefficient comparable to
the vortex Nernst signal in superconducting cuprates, and its high sensitivity
to carrier mobility, are found when the system enters the strange-metal state
from the Fermi liquid state. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of
the giant Nernst peak rule out the relevance of both Landau quasiparticles and
superconductivity. Instead, the giant Nernst peak at the crossover indicates a
dramatic change in carrier entropy when entering the strange-metal state. The
presence of such an anomalous Nernst response is further confirmed in other
iconic strange metals, suggesting its universality and places stringent
experimental constraints on the mechanism of strange metals.

<h3>Descriptor-Enabled Rational Design of High-Entropy Materials Over Vast  Chemical Spaces</h3>

The practically unlimited high-dimensional composition space of high-entropy
materials (HEMs) has emerged as an exciting platform for functional materials
design and discovery. However, the identification of stable and synthesizable
HEMs and robust design rules remains a daunting challenge due to the difficulty
in determining composition/structure-specific enthalpy and entropy
contributions to the stability and formation of HEMs. In this work, using
first-principles calculations, we find that (i) the stability and miscibility
of HEMs strongly depend on the formation enthalpy of the HEM relative to the
most stable completing phase rather than on the conventionally-viewed
enthalpies of mixing over all possible competing phases, and (ii) the entropy
forming ability of a HEM can be measured from the defect formation energy
spectrum of tens of substitutional defects in ordered binary compounds,
involving no sampling over numerous alloy configurations. Based on these
findings, we propose a highly predictive Mixed Enthalpy-Entropy Descriptor
(MEED), which enables the rational high-throughput first-principles design and
screening of new HEMs over large chemical spaces. Applying the MEED to two
structurally distinct material systems (i.e., 3D rocksalt carbides and 2D
layered sulfides), not only all experimentally reported HEMs within each system
are successfully identified, but a universal cutoff criterion for assessing
their relative synthesizability also revealed. In addition, tens of new high
entropy carbides and 2D high-entropy sulfides are also predicted. They have the
potential for a wide variety of applications such as coating in aerospace
devices, energy conversion and storage, and flexible electronics.

The three condensate wavefunctions of a spinor BEC on a spherical shell maps
the real space to the order-parameter space also with a spherical geometry,
giving rise to topological excitations called lump solitons. The homotopy of
the mapping endows the lump solitons with quantized winding numbers counting
the wrapping between the two spaces. We present several lump-soliton solutions
to the nonlinear coupled equations minimizing the energy functional. The
energies of the lump solitons with different winding numbers indicate
coexistence of lumps with different winding numbers and a lack of advantage to
break a higher-winding lump soliton into multiple lower-winding ones. Possible
implications are discussed since the predictions are testable in cold-atom
experiments.

The braiding of the worldlines of particles restricted to move on a network
(graph) is governed by the graph braid group, which can be strikingly different
from the standard braid group known from two-dimensional physics. It has been
recently shown that imposing the compatibility of graph braiding with anyon
fusion for anyons exchanging at a single wire junction leads to new types of
anyon models with the braiding exchange operators stemming from solutions of
certain generalised hexagon equations. In this work, we establish these
graph-braided anyon fusion models for general wire networks. We show that the
character of braiding strongly depends on the graph-theoretic connectivity of
the given network. In particular, we prove that triconnected networks yield the
same braiding exchange operators as the planar anyon models. In contrast,
modular biconnected networks support independent braiding exchange operators in
different modules. Consequently, such modular networks may lead to more
efficient topological quantum computer circuits. Finally, we conjecture that
the graph-braided anyon fusion models will possess the (generalised) coherence
property where certain polygon equations determine the braiding exchange
operators for an arbitrary number of anyons. We also extensively study
solutions to these polygon equations for chosen low-rank fusion rings,
including the Ising theory, quantum double of groups, and Tambara-Yamagami
models. We find numerous solutions that do not appear in the planar theory of
anyons.

We introduce a class of engines whereby units operating synchronously can be
harnessed for levering its performance and also guiding the regime of
operation. Our approach encompasses a minimal setup composed of $N$ interacting
unities placed in contact with two thermal baths and subjected to a constant
driving worksource. The interplay between synchronized unities and optimal
parameter choices provide maximal power and efficiency, the former and latter
being able to reach Curzon-Ahlborn $\eta_{CA}$ (including greater than
$\eta_{CA}$) and Carnot $\eta_c$ bounds, respectively. The main system features
are captured by treating ordered effects through a phenomenological model and a
linear analysis near the equilibrium regime. The present framework paves the
way for the building of promising nonequilibrium thermal machines based on
ordered structures.

We address the counting of level crossings for inertial stochastic processes.
We review Rice's approach to the problem and generalize the classical Rice
formula to include all Gaussian processes in their most general form. We apply
the results to some second-order (i.e., inertial) processes of physical
interest, such as Brownian motion, random acceleration and noisy harmonic
oscillators. For all models we obtain the exact crossing intensities and
discuss their long- and short-time dependence. We illustrate these results with
numerical simulations.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the spin Josephson effect in spin
superconductors based on the ferromagnetic graphene with noncollinear magnetic
configurations. For the Josephson junctions with out-of-plane magnetization,
the possible $\pi$-state spin supercurrent can be generated due to the Fermi
momentum-splitting Andreev-like reflections at the normal metal/spin
superconductor interfaces. For the Josephson junctions with in-plane
magnetization, the anomalous spin supercurrent appears and is driven by the
misorientation angle of the in-plane magnetization. The symmetry analysis shows
that the appearance of the anomalous spin Josephson current is possible when
the combined symmetry of the spin rotation and the time reversal is broken.

Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators transport charge without resistance
along topologically protected chiral one-dimensional edge states. Yet, in
magnetic topological insulators (MTI) to date, topological protection is far
from robust, with the zero-magnetic field QAH effect only realised at
temperatures an order of magnitude below the N\'eel temperature TN, though
small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological
protection breaks down is therefore essential to realising QAH effect at higher
temperatures. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to directly map the
size of the exchange gap (Eg,ex) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH
insulator 5-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We observe long-range fluctuations of Eg,ex
with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, uncorrelated to individual
point defects. We directly image the breakdown of topological protection,
showing that the chiral edge state, the hallmark signature of a QAH insulator,
hybridizes with extended gapless metallic regions in the bulk. Finally, we
unambiguously demonstrate that the gapless regions originate in magnetic
disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores Eg,ex in these
regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields.
Our results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is key to exploiting the
unique properties of QAH insulators.

Using machine learning (ML) to recognize different phases of matter and to
infer the entire phase diagram has proven to be an effective tool given a large
dataset. In our previous proposals, we have successfully explored phase
transitions for topological phases of matter at low dimensions either in a
supervised or an unsupervised learning protocol with the assistance of quantum
information related quantities. In this work, we adopt our previous ML
procedures to study quantum phase transitions of magnetism systems such as the
XY and XXZ spin chains by using spin-spin correlation functions as the input
data. We find that our proposed approach not only maps out the phase diagrams
with accurate phase boundaries, but also indicates some new features that have
not observed before. In particular, we define so-called relevant correlation
functions to some corresponding phases that can always distinguish between
those and their neighbors. Based on the unsupervised learning protocol we
proposed [Phys. Rev. B 104, 165108 (2021)], the reduced latent representations
of the inputs combined with the clustering algorithm show the connectedness or
disconnectedness between neighboring clusters (phases), just corresponding to
the continuous or disrupt quantum phase transition, respectively.

We study the properties of the impurity band in heavily-doped non-magnetic
semiconductors using the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm and the supervised deep
learning method. The disorder averaged inverse participation ratio (IPR) and
thouless number calculation show us the rich structure inside the impurity
band. A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model, which is trained to
distinguish the extended/localized phase of the Anderson model with high
accuracy, shows us the results in good agreement with the conventional
approach. Together, we find that there are three mobility edges in the impurity
band for a specific on-site impurity potential, which means the presence of the
extended states while filling the impurity band.

<h3>Circumventing the Phonon Bottleneck by Multiphonon-Mediated Hot Exciton  Cooling at the Nanoscale</h3>

<br>
<br>
In semiconductor materials, hot exciton cooling is the process by which
highly excited carriers nonradiatively relax to form a band edge exciton. While
cooling plays an important role in determining the thermal losses and quantum
yield of a system, the timescales and mechanism of cooling are not well
understood in confined semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). A mismatch between
electronic energy gaps and phonon frequencies in NCs has led to the hypothesis
of a phonon bottleneck, in which cooling would be extremely slow, while
enhanced electron-hole interactions in NCs have been used to explain cooling
that would occur on ultrafast timescales. Here, we develop an atomistic
approach for describing phonon-mediated exciton dynamics, and we use it to
simulate hot exciton cooling in NCs of experimentally relevant sizes. Our
framework includes electron-hole correlations as well as multiphonon processes,
both of which are necessary to accurately describe the cooling process. We find
that cooling occurs on timescales of tens of femtoseconds in CdSe cores, in
agreement with experimental measurements, through a cascade of relaxation
events that are mediated by efficient multiphonon emission. Cooling timescales
increase with increasing NC size due to decreased exciton-phonon coupling
(EXPC), and they are an order of magnitude larger in CdSe-CdS core-shell NCs
because of reduced EXPC to low- and mid-frequency acoustic modes.

<h3>$(k,q)$-core decomposition of hypergraphs</h3>

Complex network comprises many elements and their various types of
interactions. Hypergraph is a network with higher-order interaction than
pairwise interaction in graph. A hypergraph is formed by social interactions
among various numbers of group members in social networks, functional complexes
in biological systems, etc. Here, we consider the identification of influential
subgroup from a hypergraph. Analogous to $k$-core decomposition in graph, we
consider $(k,q)$-core decomposition in hypergraph. The $(k,q)$-core is the
maximal subgraph in which each vertex has at least $k$ hypergraph degree, and
each hyperedge contains at least $q$ vertices. We apply $(k,q)$-core pruning
processes repeatedly until a $(k,q)$-core remains. Next, we construct a random
bipartite network composed of $N$ vertices and $E$ hyperedges, in which links
are randomly assigned between pairs of vertex and hyperedge. Using the
generating function method for the distributions of vertex degree $k$ and
hyperedge size $q$, we find that a hybrid percolation transition occurs for
either $k\ge 3$ or $q\ge 3$. The critical behavior of the order parameter and
the critical slowing down phenomena appear at the transition point. We also
uncovered a distinguishable degree-dependent critical relaxation dynamics in
the $(2,2)$-core decomposition process. Finally, we propose that the

Helium, the second most abundant element in the universe, exhibits an
extremely large electronic band gap of about $20$ eV at low pressures ($\le
0.1$ GPa). While the metallization pressure of hcp helium has been accurately
predicted, thus far little attention has been paid to the specific mechanisms
driving the band-gap closure and electronic properties of this quantum crystal
in the terapascal regime (1 TPa $= 1,000$ GPa). Here, we employ
state-of-the-art density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory
calculations to fill up this knowledge gap. It is found that prior to reaching
metallicity bulk solid helium becomes an excitonic insulator (EI), an exotic
state of matter typically observed in low-dimensional systems in which
electrostatically bound electron-hole pairs form spontaneously. Furthermore, it
is shown that electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is significantly enhanced across
the EI to metal phase transition as signaled by prominent phonon softening and
giant EPC strength values ($\lambda \sim 10-100$) estimated at specific
reciprocal space points. Accordingly, we predict metallic helium to be a
superconductor with a critical temperature of $\approx 30$ K at $20$ TPa and of
$\approx 100$ K at $100$ TPa. These unforeseen phenomena have important
consequences on the elastic, thermodynamic and transport properties of metallic
helium hence may be critical for improving our fundamental understanding and
modelling of celestial bodies.

Neural quantum states are a new family of variational ans\"atze for
quantum-many body wave functions with advantageous properties in the
notoriously challenging case of two spatial dimensions. Since their
introduction a wide variety of different network architectures has been
employed to study paradigmatic models in quantum many-body physics with a
particular focus on quantum spin models. Nonetheless, many questions remain
about the effect that the choice of architecture has on the performance on a
given task. In this work, we present a unified comparison of a selection of
popular network architectures and symmetrization schemes employed for ground
state searches of prototypical spin Hamiltonians, namely the two-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model and the J1-J2 model. In the presence of a
non-trivial sign structure of the ground states, we find that the details of
symmetrization crucially influence the performance. We describe this effect in
detail and discuss its consequences, especially for autoregressive models, as
their direct sampling procedure is not compatible with the symmetrization
procedure that we found to be optimal.

<h3>Comparing Methods of Characterizing Energetic Disorder in Organic Solar  Cells</h3>

<br>
<br>
Energetic disorder has been known for decades to limit the performance of
structurally disordered semiconductors such as amorphous silicon and organic
semiconductors. However, in the past years, high performance organic solar
cells have emerged showing a continuously reduced amount of energetic disorder.
While searching for future high efficiency material systems, it is therefore
important to correctly characterize this energetic disorder. While there are
several techniques in literature, the most common approaches to probe the
density of defect states are using optical excitation as in external quantum
efficiency measurements or sequential filling of the tail states by applying an
external voltage as in admittance spectroscopy. A metanalysis of available
literature as well as our experiments using four characterization techniques on
two material systems reveal that electrical, voltage-dependent measurements
frequently yield higher values of energetic disorder than optical measurements.
With drift-diffusion simulations, we demonstrate that the approaches probe
different energy ranges of the subband-gap density of states. We further
explore the limitations of the techniques and find that extraction of
information from a capacitance-voltage curve can be inhibited by an internal
series resistance. Thereby, we explain the discrepancies between measurements
techniques with sensitivity to different energy ranges and electronic
parameters.

<br>
In-situ synthesised semiconductor/superconductor hybrid structures became an
important material platform in condensed matter physics. Their development
enabled a plethora of novel quantum transport experiments with focus on Andreev
and Majorana physics. The combination of InAs and Al has become the workhorse
material and has been successfully implemented in the form of one-dimensional
structures and two-dimensional electron gases. In contrast to the
well-developed semiconductor parts of the hybrid materials, the direct effect
of the crystal nanotexture of Al films on the electron transport still remains
unclear. This is mainly due to the complex epitaxial relation between Al and
the semiconductor. We present a study of Al films on shallow InAs
two-dimensional electron gas systems grown by molecular beam epitaxy, with
focus on control of the Al crystal structure. We identify the dominant grain
types present in our Al films and show that the formation of grain boundaries
can be significantly reduced by controlled roughening of the epitaxial
interface. Finally, we demonstrate that the implemented roughening does not
negatively impact either the electron mobility of the two-dimensional electron
gas or the basic superconducting properties of the proximitized system.

<h3>Scaling laws for single-file diffusion of adhesive particles</h3>

<br>
<br>
Single-file diffusion refers to the Brownian motion in narrow channels where
particles cannot pass each other. In such processes, the diffusion of a tagged
particle is typically normal at short times and becomes subdiffusive at long
times. For hard-sphere interparticle interaction, the time-dependent mean
squared displacement of a tracer is well understood. Here we develop a scaling
theory for adhesive particles. It provides a full description of the
time-dependent diffusive behavior with a scaling function that depends on an
effective strength of adhesive interaction. Particle clustering induced by the
adhesive interaction slows down the diffusion at short times, while it enhances
subdiffusion at long times. The enhancement effect can be quantified in
measurements irrespective of how tagged particles are injected into the system.
Combined effects of pore structure and particle adhesiveness should speed up
translocation of molecules through narrow pores.

<br>
<br>
Muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) and polar Kerr effect measurements
provide evidence for a time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconducting
state in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. However, the absence of a cusp in the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) vs. stress and the absence of a resolvable
specific heat anomaly at TRSB transition temperature ($T_{\rm TRSB}$) under
uniaxial stress challenge a hypothesis of TRSB superconductivity. Recent
$\mu$SR studies under pressure and with disorder indicate that the splitting
between $T_{\rm c}$ and $T_{\rm TRSB}$ occurs only when the structural
tetragonal symmetry is broken. To further test such behavior, we measured
$T_\text{c}$ through susceptibility measurements, and $T_\text{TRSB}$ through
$\mu$SR, under uniaxial stress applied along a $\langle 110 \rangle$ lattice
direction. We have obtained preliminary evidence for suppression of
$T_\text{TRSB}$ below $T_\text{c}$, at a rate much higher than the suppression
rate of $T_\text{c}$.

<h3>Even strong energy polydispersity does not affect the average structure  and dynamics of simple liquids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Size-polydisperse liquids have become standard models for avoiding
crystallization, thereby enabling a study of supercooled liquids and glasses
formed, e.g., in colloidal systems. Purely energy polydisperse liquids have
been studied much less, but do provide an interesting alternative. We here
study numerically the difference in structure and dynamics introducing these
two poly-dispersities separately into systems of particles interacting via the
Lennard-Jones and EXP pair potentials. To very good approximation, the average
pair structure and dynamics are unchanged, even for strong energy
polydispersity, while this is not the case for size-polydisperse systems. Even
when the system at extreme energy polydispersity undergoes a continuous phase
separation into lower and higher particle-energy regions whose structure and
dynamics are different from the average, the average structure and dynamics
still virtually the same as for the monodisperse system. Our findings are
consistent with the fact that the distribution of forces on the individual
particles do not change when energy polydispersity is introduced (while they do
change in the case of size polydispersity). A theoretical explanation of our
findings remains to be found.

<br>
<br>
We analyze and observe the Fock-Darwin (FD) states in a circular n-p junction
(CNPJ) of topological surface states. The FD states in the CNPJ are found to
have a unique core-shell structure of trapped electrons and holes, the
interplay between which is highly tunable by the magnetic field. This leads to
the trapping, detrapping and retrapping as well as other exotic behaviors
described herein that have no analog in their conventional counterparts. A
modified Einstein-Brillouin-Keller method is introduced to derive the FD states
semiclassically. Experimentally, we obtain the clearly resolved FD states up to
14 Tesla, visualizing directly the field-dependent potential landscape coming
from the electron interactions in a CNPJ at the surface of a three-dimensional
topological insulator thin film. Our findings signal the high tunability of the
FD states in CNPJs of topological surface states.

<h3>Generalized Zurek's bound on the cost of an individual classical or  quantum computation</h3>

<br>
<i>Artemy Kolchinsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the minimal thermodynamic cost of an individual computation,
where a single input $x$ is transformed into a single output $y$. In prior
work, Zurek proposed that this cost was given by $K(x\vert y)$, the conditional
Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ given $y$ (up to an additive constant which does
not depend on $x$ or $y$). However, this result was derived from an informal
argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary
dependence on the choice of physical protocol (via the additive constant). Here
we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's
bound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum
and classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly
captures the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\vert y)$ is a
fundamental cost of mapping $x$ to $y$ which must be paid using some
combination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff
between these three resources. We also show that this bound is achievable. Our
result is a kind of "algorithmic fluctuation theorem" which has implications
for the relationship between the Second Law and the Physical Church-Turing
thesis.

<h3>Ising Model on the Fibonacci Sphere</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06849" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06849</a>
<br>
<i>A. S. Pochinok, A. V. Molochkov, M. N. Chernodub</i>
<br>
<br>
We formulate the ferromagnetic Ising model on a two-dimensional sphere using
the Delaunay triangulation of the Fibonacci covering. The Fibonacci approach
generates a uniform isotropic covering of the sphere with approximately
equal-area triangles, thus potentially supporting a smooth thermodynamic limit.
In the absence of a magnetic field, the model exhibits a spontaneous
magnetization phase transition at a critical temperature that depends on the
connectivity properties of the underlying lattice. While in the standard
triangular lattice, every site is connected to 6 neighboring sites, the
triangulated Fibonacci lattice of the curved surface contains a substantial
density of the 5- and 7-vertices. As the number of sites in the Fibonacci
sphere increases, the triangular cover of the sphere experiences a series of
singular transitions that reflect a sudden change in its connectivity
properties. These changes substantially influence the statistical features of
the system leading to a series of first-order-like discontinuities as the
radius of the sphere increases. We found that the Ising model on a uniform,
Fibonacci-triangulated sphere in a large-radius limit possesses the phase
transition at the critical temperature $T_c \simeq 3.33(3) J$, which is
slightly lower than the thermodynamic result for an equilaterally triangulated
planar lattice. This mismatch is a memory effect: the planar Fibonacci lattice
remembers its origin from the curved space.

In presence of a magnetic field, the multi-component ground states appear for
trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates for both ferromagnetic and
anti-ferromagnetic types of spin-spin interaction. We aim to produce an
accurate analytical description of the multi-components states which is of
fundamental importance. First, we show the analytical results provided by the
Thomas-Fermi approximation, which is one of the most trusted and widely used
analytical method. Despite being in the regime of Thomas-Fermi approximation,
it provides wrong physical conclusions. We generalize the variational method
introduced in the article [Eur. Phys. J. Plus 137, 547 (2022)] and demonstrate
that the variational method is crucial in giving a proper analytical
description of the multi-component states which is also backed by numerical
simulation.

<h3>Hybrid single-pair charge-2 Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Intuitively, the dispersion characteristics of Weyl nodes with opposite
charges in single-pair charge-2 Weyl semimetals are the same, quadratic or
linear. We theoretically predicted that single-pair hybrid charge-2 Weyl
semimetals (the nodes with opposite charges show quadratic Weyl and linear
charge-2 Dirac characteristics, respectively) can be protected by specific
nonsymmorphic symmetries in spinless systems. Moreover, the symmetries force
the pair of Weyl points locate at the center and corners of the first Brillouin
zone (FBZ), respectively. Consequently, nontrivial surface states run through
the entire FBZ of the system fascinating for future experimental detection and
device applications. The hybrid phase is further verified with the help of
first-principles calculations for the phonon states in realistic material of
Na$_2$Zn$_2$O$_3$. The new phase will not only broaden the understanding of the
Weyl semimetals, but also provide an interesting platform to investigate the
interaction between the two types of Weyl fermions with different dispersions.

<br>
A critical end point above which an isotropic phase continuously evolves into
a polar (ferroelectric) nematic phase with an increasing electric field is
found in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline material. The critical end
point is approximately 30 K above the zero-field transition temperature from
the isotropic to nematic phase and at an electric field of the order of 10
V/micron. Such systems are interesting from the application point of view
because a strong birefringence can be induced in a broad temperature range in
an optically isotropic phase.

We revisit the antiferromagnetic structure of $\rm Tb_{14}Ag_{51}$ [P.
Fischer., $et\, al$. (2005). PRB, 72 134413] with the propagation vector
$[{1\over3},{1\over3},{0}] $ and parent space group $P6/m$ using both magnetic
symmetry and irreducible representation arguments. We have found a new magnetic
structure under the hexagonal Shubnikov magnetic space group $P\bar{6}'$, which
fits much better the experimental data. This new solution was obtained by
constraining the spin arrangement to one of the three possible magnetic space
groups of maximal symmetry that can be realised by a magnetic ordering
transforming according to the 4-dimensional physically irreducible
representation that is known to be relevant in this magnetic phase. The refined
model, parameterised under $P\bar{6}'$, implicitly includes the presence of a
third harmonic with the propagation vector at the gamma point $[0,0,0]$, which
has an important weight in the final result. The structure consists of 13
symmetry-independent Tb magnetic moments with the same size of $8.48(2)\mu_B$,
propagating cycloidally in the $ab$-plane. The modulation has a substantial
deviation from being purely sinusoidal due to the contribution of the mentioned
third harmonic.

<h3>Toroidal hollow-core microcavities produced by self-rolling of strained  polymer bilayer films</h3>

<br>
<i>V Luchnikov, K Kumar, M Stamm</i>
<br>
<br>
Hollow-core toroidal micro-cavities are obtained by self-rolling of
double-layer (polyvinyl pyridine/polystyrole) polymer films. Rolling of the
bilayer is due to preferential swelling of the polyvinyl pyridine in water
solution of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid. The tube formation proceeds from a
circular opening in the film made by photolithography or by mechanical
scratching. The toroid equilibrium dimensions are determined by the balance of
the elastic energy relaxation via the film scrolling and the work of the
in-plane stretching that is due to increasing radius of the toroid. The
principal features of the micro-toroid formation process are captured by a
simple analytical model. The inner walls of the cavities can be made metal
coated. To this aim, the polymer bilayer can be metallized by vacuum sputtering
prior to lithographic patterning and rolling of the bilayer. The toroids with
metallic inner surface are promising for the future research as IR-frequency
range resonators.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the avalanche temporal statistics of the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model when the dynamics is critical and
takes place on finite random networks. By considering numerical simulations on
annealed topologies we show that the survival probability always exhibits three
distinct dynamical regimes. Size-dependent crossover timescales separating them
scale differently for homogeneous and for heterogeneous networks. The
phenomenology can be qualitatively understood based on known features of the
SIS dynamics on networks. A fully quantitative approach based on Langevin
theory is shown to perfectly reproduce the results for homogeneous networks,
while failing in the heterogeneous case. The analysis is extended to quenched
random networks, which behave in agreement with the annealed case for strongly
homogeneous and strongly heterogeneous networks.

<br>
<i>Víctor M. García-Suárez</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose here a feasible and effective design of new thermoelectric systems
based on physical gaps in nanoscale junctions. We show that, depending on the
type of features, i.e. the character of surface/edge states, on both sides of
the gap, it is possible to achieve rather high figures of merit. In particular,
we show that for configurations that have localized states at the
surfaces/edges, which translate into sharp resonances in the transmission, it
is possible to achieve large Seebeck coefficients and figures of merit by
carefully tuning their energy and their coupling to other states. We calculate
the thermoelectric coefficients as a function of different parameters and find
non-obvious behaviours, like the existence of a certain coupling between the
localized and bulk states for which these quantities have a maximum. The
highest Seebeck coefficients and figures of merit are achieved for symmetric
junctions, which have the same coupling between the localized state and the
bulk states on both sides of the gap. The features and trends of the
thermoelectric properties and their change with various parameters that we find
here cannot only be applied to systems with nanogaps, but also to many other
nanoscale junctions, such as e.g. those that have surface states or states
localized near the contacts between the nanoscale object and the electrodes.
The model presented here can therefore be used to characterize and predict the
thermoelectric properties of many different nanoscale junctions and can also
serve as a guide for studying other systems. These results pave then the way
for the design and fabrication of stable next-generation thermoelectric devices
with robust features and improved performances.

In the UK Network Rail Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2020-2050,
minimal waste and the sustainable use of materials are highlighted as core
priorities. The ambition is to reuse, repurpose or redeploy all resources. In
low adhesion conditions, sand particles are used to enhance traction throughout
the network. However, sand is in danger of becoming scarce as many applications
demand it. In this study, an alternative adhesion-enhancing particle system
made of recycled crushed glass is examined in terms of density, size, shape
distribution, mineralogy, mechanical properties, and bulk behaviour to better
understand their characteristics in comparison with the typical Great British
rail sand currently in use and reported in the literature. Their effects on
tribological behaviour and surface damage are also investigated using the
High-Pressure Torsion test in dry, wet, and leaf-contaminated conditions. Both
particle characterisation and tribological testing show promising results.
Recycled glass particles provide an acceptable level of traction with a similar
level of rail damage as typical rail sand. It is suggested to perform
full-scale laboratory and field tests to further confirm this material's
suitability.

Metallic glasses are frequently used as structural materials. Therefore, it
is important to develop methods to predict their mechanical response as a
function of the microstructure prior to loading. We develop a coarse-grained
spring network model, which describes the mechanical response of metallic
glasses using an equivalent series network of springs, which can break and
re-form to mimic atomic rearrangements during deformation. To validate the
model, we perform simulations of quasistatic, uniaxial tension of Lennard-Jones
and embedded atom method (EAM) potentials for Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$ metallic
glasses. We consider samples prepared using a wide range of cooling rates and
with different amounts of crystalline order. We show that both the
Lennard-Jones and EAM models possess qualitatively similar stress $\sigma$
versus strain $\gamma$ curves. By specifying five parameters in the spring
network model (ultimate strength, strain at ultimate strength, slopes of
$\sigma(\gamma)$ at $\gamma=0$ and at large strain, and strain at fracture
where $\sigma=0$), we can accurately describe the form of the stress-strain
curves during uniaxial tension for the computational studies of
Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, as well as recent experimental studies of several Zr-based
metallic glasses. For the computational studies of Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, we find
that the yield strain distribution is shifted to larger strains for slowly
cooled glasses compared to rapidly cooled glasses. In addition, the average
number of new springs and their rate of formation decreases with decreasing
cooling rate. These effects offset each other at large strains, causing the
stress-strain curve to become independent of the sample preparation protocol in
this regime. In future studies, we will extract the parameters that define the
spring network model directly from atomic rearrangements that occur during
uniaxial deformation.

We demonstrate field-induced single-ion magnetic anisotropy resulting from
the multiorbital Kondo effect on diluted ytterbium alloy
(Lu$_{1-x}$Yb$_x$)Rh$_2$Zn$_{20}$. Single-ion anisotropic metamagnetic behavior
is revealed in low-temperature regions where the local Fermi-liquid state is
formed. Specific heat and low-field magnetic susceptibility indicate
reproduction of the ground-state properties by the SU($N =$ 8) Kondo model with
a relatively large $c$-$f$ hybridization of $T_{\mathrm{K}} =$ 60.9 K.
Dynamical susceptibility measurements on YbRh$_2$Zn$_{20}$ support the
realization of multiorbital Kondo ground state in
(Lu$_{1-x}$Yb$_x$)Rh$_2$Zn$_{20}$. The single-ion magnetic anisotropy becomes
evident above $\sim$ 5 T, which is lower than the isotropic Kondo crossover
field of 22.7 T, verifying blurred low-lying crystal field states through the

alkali-activated materials (AAMs). Here, two physics-based compositional
parameters are derived to describe the relative reactivity of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2
and CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glasses in alkaline environments: (i) a modified average
metal oxide dissociation energy (AMODE) parameter developed from molecular
dynamics simulations; and (ii) a topology constraint parameter derived from
topological constraint theory. Both parameters are seen to generally outperform
existing compositional parameters from the literature for a wide range of
aluminosilicate glasses. Given that both the modified AMODE and topology
constraint parameters can be calculated directly from chemical compositions,
this study represents a major step forward in connecting aluminosilicate glass
compositions with their reactivity in alkaline environments. The limitations of
these compositional parameters, including their inability to capture the impact
of Ca versus Mg on glass reactivity, have also been discussed.

Interactions between negatively charged aluminosilicate species and
positively charged metal cations are critical to many important engineering
processes and applications, including sustainable cements and aluminosilicate
glasses. In an effort to probe these interactions, here we have calculated the
pair-wise interaction energies (i.e., binding energies) between aluminosilicate
dimer/trimer and 17 different metal cations using a density functional theory
(DFT) approach. Analysis of the DFT-optimized structural representations for
the clusters (dimer/trimer + cation) shows that their structural attributes
(e.g., interatomic distances) are generally consistent with literature
observations on aluminosilicate glasses. The DFT-derived binding energies are
seen to vary considerably depending on the type of cations (i.e., charge and
ionic radii) and aluminosilicate species (i.e., dimer or trimer). A survey of
the literature reveals that the difference in the calculated binding energies
between different cations can be used to explain many literature observations
on the impact of cations on materials properties (e.g., glass corrosion,
mineral dissolution, and ionic transport). Analysis of all the DFT-derived
binding energies reveals that the correlation between these energy values and
the ionic potential and field strength of the cations are well captured by 2nd
order polynomial functions (R2 values of 0.99-1.00 are achieved for
regressions). Given that the ionic potential and field strength of a given
metal cation can be readily estimated using well-tabulated ionic radii
available in the literature, these simple polynomial functions would enable
rapid estimation of the binding energies of a much wider range of cations with
the aluminosilicate dimer/trimer, providing guidance on the design and
optimization of sustainable cements and aluminosilicate glasses and their
associated applications.

We test the standard model for the length contraction of a bundle of strings
under twist, and find deviation that is significantly greater than typically
appreciated and that has a different nature at medium and large twist angles.
By including volume conservation, we achieve better fits to data for single-,
double-, and triple-stranded bundles of Nylon monofilament as an ideal test
case. This gives a well-defined procedure for extracting an effective twist
radius that characterizes contraction behavior. While our approach accounts for
the observed faster-than-expected contraction up to medium twist angles, we
also find that the contraction is nevertheless slower than expected at large
twist angles for both Nylon monofilament bundles and several other string
types. The size of this effect varies with the individual-string braid
structure and with the number of strings in the bundle. We speculate that it
may be related to elastic deformation within the material. However, our first
modeling attempt does not fully capture the observed behavior.

Promising applications in photonics are driven by the ability to fabricate
crystal-quality metal thin films of controlled thickness down to a few
nanometers. In particular, these materials exhibit a highly nonlinear response
to optical fields owing to the induced ultrafast electron dynamics, which is
however poorly understood on such mesoscopic length scales. Here, we reveal a
new mechanism that controls the nonlinear optical response of thin metallic
films, dominated by ultrafast electronic heat transport when the thickness is
sufficiently small. By experimentally and theoretically studying electronic
transport in such materials, we explain the observed temporal evolution of
photoluminescence in pump-probe measurements that we report for crystalline
gold flakes. Incorporating a first-principles description of the electronic
band structures, we model electronic transport and find that ultrafast thermal
dynamics plays a pivotal role in determining the strength and time-dependent
characteristics of the nonlinear photoluminescence signal, which is largely
influenced by the distribution of hot electrons and holes, subject to diffusion
across the film as well as relaxation to lattice modes. Our findings introduce
conceptually novel elements triggering the nonlinear optical response of
nanoscale materials while suggesting additional ways to control and leverage
hot carrier distributions in metallic films.

Explaining quantum many-body dynamics is a long-held goal of physics. A
rigorous operator algebraic theory of dynamics in locally interacting systems
in any dimension is provided here in terms of time-dependent Gibbs ensembles.
The theory explains dynamics in closed, open and time-dependent systems and
time-dependent Gibbs ensembles unify wide classes of quantum non-ergodic and
ergodic systems. The theory is applied to quantum many-body scars, continuous,
discrete and dissipative time crystals, Hilbert space fragmentation, lattice
gauge theories, and disorder-free localization, among other cases. Novel
pseudo-local classes of operators are introduced in the process:
projected-local, which are local only for some states, crypto-local, whose
locality is not manifest in terms of any finite number of local densities and
transient ones, that dictate finite-time relaxation dynamics. An immediate
corollary is proving saturation of the Mazur bound for the Drude weight. This
proven theory is intuitively the rigorous algebraic counterpart of the weak
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and has deep implications for
thermodynamics: quantum many-body systems 'out-of-equilibrium' are actually
always in a time-dependent equilibrium state for any natural initial state. The
work opens the possibility of designing novel out-of-equilibrium phases, with
the newly identified scarring phase transition being an example.
