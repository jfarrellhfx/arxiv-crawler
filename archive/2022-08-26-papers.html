<h3>Fragmentation-induced localization and boundary charges in dimensions two and above</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12260v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12260v1</a>

We study higher dimensional models with symmetric correlated hoppings, which
generalize a one-dimensional model introduced in the context of
dipole-conserving dynamics. We prove rigorously that whenever the local
configuration space takes its smallest non-trivial value, these models exhibit
localized behavior due to fragmentation, in any dimension. For the same class
of models, we then construct a hierarchy of conserved quantities that are
power-law localized at the boundary of the system with increasing powers.
Combining these with Mazur's bound, we prove that boundary correlations are
infinitely long lived, even when the bulk is not localized. We use our results
to construct quantum Hamiltonians that exhibit the analogues of strong zero
modes in two and higher dimensions.

A Deconfined Quantum Critical Point (DQCP) is an exotic non-Landau transition
between distinct symmetry-breaking phases, with many 2+1D and 1+1D examples. We
show that a DQCP can occur in zero spatial dimensions, as a boundary phase
transition of a 1+1D gapless system. Such novel boundary phenomena can occur at
phase transitions between distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases,
whose protected edge modes are incompatible and compete at criticality. We
consider a minimal symmetry class $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ which
protects two non-trivial SPT phases in 1+1D. Tuning between these, we find a
critical point with central charge $c=8/5$ and two stable boundary phases
spontaneously breaking one of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetries at the 0+1D edge.
Subsequently tuning a single boundary parameter leads to a direct continuous
transition -- a 0+1D DQCP, which we show analytically and numerically. Similar
to higher-dimensional cases, this DQCP describes a condensation of vortices of
one phase acting as order parameters for other. Moreover, we show that it is
also a Delocalized Quantum Critical Point, since there is an emergent symmetry
mixing boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. This work suggests that studying
criticality between non-trivial SPT phases is fertile soil and we discuss how
it provides insights into the burgeoning field of gapless SPT phases.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12235v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12235v1</a>

<br>
We have studied the magnetic response of transverse optical phonons in
Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Te films. Polarization-dependent terahertz
magnetospectroscopy measurements revealed Zeeman splittings and diamagnetic
shifts, demonstrating that these phonon modes become chiral in magnetic fields.
Films in the topological crystalline insulator phase ($x > 0.32$) exhibited
magnetic moment values that are larger than those for topologically trivial
films ($x < 0.32$) by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the sign of the
effective $g$-factor was opposite in the two phases, which can be explained by
our theoretical model. These results strongly hint at the existence of
interplay between the magnetic properties of chiral phonons and the topology of
electronic band structure.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12228v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12228v1</a>
<br>
<i>Yaroslav V. Zhumagulov, Salvatore Chiavazzo, Ivan A. Shelykh, Oleksandr Kyriienko</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the regime of strong-light matter coupling with remarkable
magnetic properties can be realized in systems based on monolayers of chromium
triiodide (CrI3). This two-dimensional material combines the presence of
ferromagnetic ordering with the possibility of forming strongly-bound excitonic
complexes even at room temperature. Using microscopic first-principle
calculations we reveal a rich spectrum of optical transitions, corresponding to
both Wannier- and Frenkel-type excitons, including those containing electrons
with a negative effective mass. We show that excitons of different
polarizations efficiently hybridize with a photonic mode of a planar
microcavity, and due to the peculiar selection rules polariton modes become
well resolved in circular polarizations. The combination of very strong optical
oscillator strength of excitons and cavity confinement leads to large values of
the Rabi splitting, reaching 35 meV for a single monolayer, and giant Zeeman
splitting between polariton modes of up to 20 meV. This makes CrI3 an excellent
platform for magnetopolaritonic applications.

</body><h3>On adiabatic theory for extended fermionic lattice systems</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12220v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12220v1</a>
<br>
<i>Joscha Henheik, Tom Wessel</i>
<br>
<br>
We review recent results on adiabatic theory for ground states of extended
gapped fermionic lattice systems under several different assumptions. More
precisely, we present generalized super-adiabatic theorems for extended but
finite as well as infinite systems, assuming either a uniform gap or a gap in
the bulk above the unperturbed ground state. The goal of this note is to
provide an overview of these adiabatic theorems and briefly outline the main
ideas and techniques required in their proofs.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12204v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12204v1</a>
<br>
<i>S. Josephine Suh</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose that the underlying context of holographic duality and the
Ryu-Takayanagi formula is that the volume measure of spacetime is a probability
measure constrained by quantum dynamics. We define quantum stochastic processes
using joint quantum distributions which are realized in a quantum system as
expectation values of products of projectors. In anti-de Sitter JT gravity, we
show that Einstein's equations arise from the evolution of probability under
the quantum stochastic process induced by the boundary, with the area of
compactified space in the gravitational theory identified as a probability
density evolving under the quantum process. Extrapolating these and related
results in flat JT gravity found in arXiv:2108.10916, we conjecture that
general relativity arises in the semi-classical limit of the evolution of
probability with respect to quantum stochastic processes.

</body><h3>Probing Topological signatures in an optically driven $α$-${T_3}$ Lattice</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12203v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12203v1</a>
<br>
<i>Lakpa Tamang, Tutul Biswas</i>
<br>
<br>
The $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice demonstrates an interpolation between the
honeycomb lattice of graphene($\alpha=0$) and the dice lattice($\alpha=1$) with
the continuous variation of the parameter $\alpha\in[0,1]$. When illuminated by
an off-resonant circularly polarized light, it undergoes a topological phase
transition across $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$ which is characterized by a change in the
valence (conduction) band's Chern number from $+1(-1)$ to $+2(-2)$. The
knowledge about the topological nature of the system is expected to be embodied
in some experimentally measurable physical properties. To capture the
photo-induced topological signatures, we study Berry phase mediated bulk
properties of a driven $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice such as the orbital
magnetization, thermoelectric responses particularly, the anomalous Nernst
effect etc. It is revealed that both the orbital magnetization and anomalous
Nernst coefficient show distinct topological characteristics. For instance, the
orbital magnetization varies linearly with the chemical potential in the band
gap regions of the quasienergy spectrum. As a consequence of the broken
particle-hole symmetry for $0<\alpha<1$, we find valley-contrasting features in
all thermoelectric coefficients as well as in the orbital magnetization which
further open up the possibility to use the underlying driven system in the
valley caloritronic applications.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12202v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12202v1</a>
<br>
<i>Roman Ya. Kezerashvili, Anastasia Spiridonova</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict angle-dependent superfluidity for a new class of 2D materials --
transition metals trichalcogenides (TMTC). Within a mean-field approach
superfluidity of indirect excitons in TMTC van der Waals heterostructures
(vdWHs) is studied. We use different potentials for charged carriers
interaction to analyze the influence of the screening on the studied phenomena.
Our study demonstrates the angle-dependent superfluidity temperature in TMTC
vdWHs: for a given density a maximum and minimum $T_c$ of superfluidity occurs
along chain and $a$-directions, respectively. This work can guide experimental
research toward the realization of anisotropic superfluidity in TMTC vdWH. We
suggest an experiment for the observation of anisotropic superfluidity in TMTC
vdWH.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12200v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12200v1</a>
<br>
<i>Yajun Zhang, Xu He, Jingtong Zhang, Jie Wang, Philippe Ghosez</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin fluctuations and superconductivity are closely entangled, elucidating
the magnetic interactions in nickelate superconductors is at the heart of
understanding the pairing mechanism. Our first-principles and spin-wave theory
calculations highlight that NdNiO$_2$ is in the vicinity of a transition
between a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) state and a 3D
C-AFM state and both states could accurately reproduce the experimentally
measured magnetic excitation spectra, which was previously explained in terms
of a 2D model. We further reveal that hole doping stabilizes an incommensurate
(IC) spin state and the IC wave vector increases continuously. Direct links
between hole doping, magnetization, exchange constants, and magnetic order are
established and we reveal that the competition between first-neighbor and
third-neighbor in-plane magnetic interactions is the key for the IC magnetic
order.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12197v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12197v1</a>
<br>
<i>Liam A. V. Nagle-Cocco, Joshua D. Bocarsly, Krishnakanth Sada, Clemens Ritter, Emannuelle Suard, Nicola D. Kelly, Cheng Liu, Clare P. Grey, Prabeer Barpanda, Sian E. Dutton</i>
<br>
<br>
Cryptomelane is a hollandite-like material consisting of K$^+$ cations in an
$\alpha$-MnO$_2$ tunnel-like crystallographic motif. A sample with
stoichiometry K$_{1.461(4)}$Mn$_8$O$_{16}$ has been synthesised and its
magnetic properties investigated using variable-temperature magnetic
susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron powder diffraction. Three distinct
magnetic transitions at $184$\,K, $54.5$\,K, and $24$\,K are assigned to
K$_{1.461(4)}$Mn$_8$O$_{16}$. Magnetic Bragg peaks emerge below $54.5$\,K, and
from their positions they indicate a modulated magnetic structure which is
incommensurate with the crystallographic nuclear structure. The model
consistent with the data is a dual-$\vec{k}_\mathrm{mag}$ structure with a
canted ferrimagnetic $\vec{k}_\mathrm{mag}=0$ component and an incommensurate
$\vec{k}_\mathrm{mag}=(0,0,k_z)$ [$k_z=0.36902(15)$] component, with the latter
most likely to be of the helical type formerly proposed for this material.
Below 24\,K, there is a magnetic transition, which gives rise to a different
set of magnetic Bragg peaks indicative of a highly complex magnetic structure.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12169v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12169v1</a>
<br>
<i>Shinsei Ryu, Junggi Yoon</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the two-dimensional free symplectic fermion with anti-periodic
boundary condition. This model has negative norm states with naive inner
product. This negative norm problem can be cured by introducing a new inner
product. We demonstrate that this new inner product follows from the connection
between the path integral formalism and the operator formalism. This model has
negative central charge, $c=-2$, and we clarify how CFT$_2$ with negative
central charge can have the non-negative norm. We introduce $\alpha$-vacua in
which the Hamiltonian is seemingly non-Hermitian. In spite of non-Hermiticity
we find that the energy spectrum is real. We also compare a correlation
function with respect to the $\alpha$-vacua with that of the de Sitter space.

<br>
<br>
We present results on experimental studies of spin current, measured under
spin pumping at ferromag-netic resonance in wide frequency band 2-20 GHz for
SrIrO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 heterostructures fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering at
high temperature. The epitaxial growth of the thin film in heterostructure by a
cube-on-cube mechanism was confirmed by XRD and TEM analysis. Taking into
account the con-tribution of anisotropic magnetoresistance the spin current was
estimated as 1/3 of the total response. We show that both real and imaginary
parts of spin mixing conductance are valuable for heterostructures with strong
spin-orbit interaction in SrIrO3. Imaginary part of spin mixing conductance was
estimated by means of shift of ferromagnetic resonance field of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3
layer in heterostructure. The spin mag-netoresistance was evaluated from
angular dependencies of magnetoresistance measured in planar Hall
configuration. In order to extract the influence of anisotropic
magnetoresistance a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 film was measured as well. The spin Hall
angle for heterostructure was found higher than for interface Pt/
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3.

</body><h3>Atomistic modeling of thermal effects in focused electron beam induced deposition of Me$_2$Au(tfac)</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12134v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12134v1</a>
<br>
<i>Alexey Prosvetov, Alexey V. Verkhovtsev, Gennady Sushko, Andrey V. Solov'yov</i>
<br>
<br>
The role of thermal effects in the focused electron beam induced deposition
(FEBID) process of Me$_2$Au(tfac) is studied by means of irradiation-driven
molecular dynamics simulations. The FEBID of Me$_2$Au(tfac), a commonly used
precursor molecule for the fabrication of gold nanostructures, is simulated at
different temperatures in the range of $300-450$ K. The deposit's structure,
morphology, growth rate, and elemental composition at different temperatures
are analyzed. The fragmentation cross section for Me$_2$Au(tfac) is evaluated
on the basis of the cross sections for structurally similar molecules.
Different fragmentation channels involving the dissociative ionization (DI) and
dissociative electron attachment (DEA) mechanisms are considered. The conducted
simulations of FEBID confirm experimental observations that deposits consist of
small gold clusters embedded into a carbon-rich organic matrix. The simulation
results indicate that accounting for both DEA- and DI-induced fragmentation of
all the covalent bonds in Me$_2$Au(tfac) and increasing the amount of energy
transferred to the system upon fragmentation increase the concentration of gold
in the deposit. The simulations predict an increase in Au:C ratio in the
deposit from 0.18 to 0.25 upon the temperature increase from 300 K to 450 K,
being within the range of experimentally reported values.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12131v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12131v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The scalability of the quantum processor technology is elemental in reaching
fault-tolerant quantum computing. Owing to the maturity of silicon
microelectronics, quantum bits (qubits) realized with spins in silicon quantum
dots are considered among the most promising technologies for building scalable
quantum computers. However, to realize quantum-dot-based high-fidelity quantum
processing units several challenges need to be solved. In this respect,
improving the charge noise environment of silicon quantum dot-based qubits and
the development of ultra-low-power on-chip cryogenic classical complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics for the manipulation and
interfacing of the qubits are important milestones. We report scalable
interfacing of highly tunable and ultra-low charge noise electron and hole
quantum dots embedded in a 64-channel cryogenic CMOS multiplexer, which has
less-than-detectable static power dissipation (< 1 pW) even at sub-1 K
temperatures. Our integrated hybrid quantum-dot CMOS technology provides a
route to scalable interfacing of up to millions of high-quality quantum dots
enabling, for example, straightforward variability analysis and qubit geometry
optimization, which are essential prerequisites for building fault-tolerant
large-scale silicon-based quantum computers. At 5.6 K temperature, we find
unprecedentedly low charge noise of 22 and 28 $\mu$eV/$\sqrt {Hz}$ at 1 Hz in
the electrostatically defined few-electron and few-hole quantum dots,
respectively. The low-noise quantum dots are realized by harnessing a custom
CMOS process that utilizes a conventional doped-Poly-Si/SiO$_2$/Si MOS stack.
This approach provides lower charge noise background than high-k metal gate
solutions and translates into higher spin qubit fidelities.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12098v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12098v1</a>
<br>
<i>Masaki Tezuka, Onur Oktay, Enrico Rinaldi, Masanori Hanada, Franco Nori</i>
<br>
<br>
The sparse version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model reproduces essential
features of the original SYK model while reducing the number of disorder
parameters. In this paper, we propose a further simplification of the model
which we call the binary-coupling sparse SYK model. We set the nonzero
couplings to be $\pm 1$, rather than being sampled from a continuous
distribution such as Gaussian. Remarkably, this simplification turns out to be
an improvement: the binary-coupling model exhibits strong correlations in the
spectrum, which is the important feature of the original SYK model that leads
to the quick onset of the random-matrix universality, more efficiently in terms
of the number of nonzero terms. This model is better suited for analog or
digital quantum simulations of quantum chaotic behavior and holographic metals
due to its simplicity and scaling properties.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12087v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12087v1</a>
<br>
<i>Devanshu Shekhar, Pragya Shukla</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically analyze the dynamics of average entanglement measures of a
typical quantum state of a complex system, with its reduced density matrix
described by a generalized, multi-parametric Wishart ensemble with unit trace.
Our results indicate quantitatively different rate of increase of the average
Renyi and Von-Neumann entropies with evolving complexity of the state as system
parameters change. While the state itself is multiparametric, we find that the
growth of the average measures can be described in terms of an
information-theoretic function, referred as the complexity parameter that could
also act as a possible tool for hierarchical arrangement of entangled states.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12077v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12077v1</a>
<br>
<i>H. Okamura, T. Mizokawa, K. Miki, Y. Matsui, N. Noguchi, N. Katayama, H. Sawa, M. Nohara, Y. Lu, H. Takagi, Y. Ikemoto, T. Moriwaki</i>
<br>
<br>
The layered chalcogenide Ta2NiSe5 has recently attracted much interest as a
strong candidate for the long sought excitonic insulator (EI). Since the
physical properties of an EI are expected to depend sensitively on the external
pressure, it is important to clarify the pressure evolution of microscopic
electronic state in Ta2NiSe5. Here we report the optical conductivity [s(w)] of
Ta2NiSe5 measured at high pressures to 10 GPa and at low temperatures to 8 K.
With cooling at ambient pressure, s(w) develops an energy gap of about 0.17 eV
and a pronounced excitonic peak at 0.38 eV, as already reported in the
literature. Upon increasing pressure, the energy gap becomes narrower and the
excitonic peak is broadened. Above a structural transition at Ps~3 GPa, the
energy gap becomes partially filled, indicating that Ta2NiSe5 is a semimetal
after the EI state is suppressed by pressure. At higher pressures, s(w)
exhibits metallic characteristics with no energy gap. The detailed pressure
evolution of s(w) is presented, and discussed mainly in terms of a weakening of
excitonic correlation with pressure.

<i>Pavel Putrov</i>
<br>
<br>
We summarize basic features of quantum field theories with discrete symmetry
$\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ (possibly higher form, global or gauged). The
classification of representations and anomalies is quite rich and involves the
ring of profinite integers. As a main example we consider in detail 3d
topological Dijkgraaf-Witten $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ gauge theories. We also
briefly discuss relevance for some previously considered physical systems. In
particular we comment on a relation to the recently discovered non-invertible
symmetry in 4d QED and the problem of categorification of Chern-Simons TQFT.

<br>
<br>
The optical spectrum of a quantum dot is typically dominated by the
fundamental transition between the lowest-energy configurations. However, the
radiative Auger process can result in additional red-shifted emission lines.
The origin of these lines is a combination of Coulomb interaction and
symmetry-breaking in the quantum dot. In this paper, we present measurements of
such radiative Auger lines for a range of InGaAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum
dots and use a tight-binding model with a configuration interaction approach to
explain their appearance. Introducing a composition fluctuation cluster in the
dot, our calculations show excellent agreement with measurements. We relate our
findings to group theory explaining the origin of the additional emission
lines. Our model and results give insight into the interplay between the
symmetry breaking in a quantum dot and the position and strength of the
radiative Auger lines.

In this work we explore the best suited computational method through a
comparative quantitative analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of
Nickel (Ni). In this direction DFT, GW, and DFT+DMFT based
$state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ techniques are used. The Coulomb interaction
parameters, $U_{full}$ = 5.78 $eV$ and $J$ = 1.1 $eV$ computed using cRPA and
Yukawa screening method, respectively, along with Full type of Coulomb
interaction within DFT+DMFT prove to be a suitable choice for studying occupied
& unoccupied electronic structures, and temperature dependent magnetization of
Ni. The calculated spin resolved values of imaginary part of the self-energy

description of experimental electronic excitation spectra. This study shows the
equal contribution of correlation effects and plasmon excitations to the
intensity of famous 6 $eV$ satellite and hence paving way for its
reinterpretation.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12039v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12039v1</a>
<br>
<i>SK Firoz Islam, A. Yu. Zyuzin, Alexander A. Zyuzin</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theory of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene and analyze the superconducting phase diagram in presence of the
magnetic field. Namely, we consider a model of a granular array hosting
localized states, which are hybridized via the delocalized fermions in the
inter-grain regions. We study a strong coupling situation when the interactions
lead to an incoherent state with preformed Cooper pairs inside the grains. The
Andreev scattering among different grains manifests itself through the global
phase-coherent superconducting state at lower temperatures. We demonstrate that
a new phase transition between the preformed Cooper pairing state and the
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell state might be induced by the spin
pair-breaking effect of in-plane magnetic field. The upper critical magnetic
field is shown to be enhanced in the strong coupling case.

The critical behavior of the non-diffusive susceptible-infected-recovered
model on lattices had been well established in virtue of its duality symmetry.
By performing simulations and scaling analyses, we show that diffusion for all
agents, while rendering this symmetry destroyed, constitutes a singular
perturbation that induces asymptotically distinct dynamical and stationary
critical behavior from the non-diffusive model. In particular, the manifested
crossover behavior in the effective mean-square radius exponents reveals that
slow crossover behavior in general diffusive multi-species reaction systems may
be ascribed to the interference of multiple length scales and timescales at
early times.

Magnet$/$superconductor hybrids (MSHs) hold the promise to host emergent
topological superconducting phases. Both one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems in proximity to s-wave superconductors
have shown evidence of gapped topological superconductivity with zero-energy
end states and chiral edge modes. Recently, it was proposed that the bulk
transition-metal dichalcogenide 4Hb$-$TaS$_2$ is a gapless topological
nodal-point superconductor (TNPSC). However, there has been no experimental
realization of a TNPSC in a MSH system yet. Here we present the discovery of
TNPSC in antiferromagnetic (AFM) monolayers on top of an s-wave superconductor.
Our calculations show that the topological phase is driven by the AFM order,
resulting in the emergence of a gapless time-reversal invariant topological
superconducting state. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we
observe a low-energy edge mode, which separates the topological phase from the
trivial one, at the boundaries of antiferromagnetic islands. As predicted by
the calculations, we find that the relative spectral weight of the edge mode
depends on the edge's atomic configuration. Our results establish the
combination of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity as a novel route to
design 2D topological quantum phases.

We study non-hermitian many-body physics in the interacting Hatano-Nelson
model with open boundary condition. The violation of reciprocity, resulting
from an imaginary vector potential, induces the non-hermitian skin-effect and
causes exponential localization for all single particle eigenfunctions in the
non-interacting limit. Nevertheless, the density profile of the interacting
system becomes only slightly tilted relative to the average filling. The
Friedel oscillations exhibit a beating pattern due to the modification of the
Fermi wavenumber. The probability distribution of particles over any finite
interval is the normal distribution, whose mean scales with the imaginary
vector potential and the variance is symmetric to the center of the chain. This
is confirmed by several numerically exact methods even for relatively small
systems. These features are expected to be generic not only for fermions, which
naturally repel each other due to Pauli's exclusion principle, but for
interacting bosons as well. Our findings indicate that many-body effects can
significantly alter and conceal the single particle properties and the skin
effect in non-hermitian systems.
