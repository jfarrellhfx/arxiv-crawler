<h3>Active microrheology of fluids with orientational order</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14850</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. S. Lintuvuori, A. Würger</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of a driven spherical colloidal particle moving in a
fluid with a broken rotational symmetry. Using a nematic liquid crystal as a
model, we demonstrate that when the applied force is not aligned along or
perpendicular to the orientational order, the colloidal velocity does not align
with the force, but forms an angle with respect to the pulling direction. This
leads to blue an anisotropic hydrodynamic drag tensor which depends on the
material parameters. In the case of nematic liquid crystal, we give an
analytical expression and discuss the resulting implications for active
microrheology experiments on fluids with broken rotational symmetry.

<h3>Compressible quantum matter with vanishing Drude weight</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14747" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14747</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Nisarga Paul, Ady Stern, Liang Fu</i>
<p>We explore the possibility of quantum states of matter that are compressible
but have vanishing DC conductivity in the absence of disorder. We show that the
composite Fermi liquid emerging from strong interaction in a generic Chern band
has zero Drude weight, in stark contrast to normal Fermi liquids. Our work
establishes the absence of Drude weight as the defining property of the
composite Fermi liquid phase, which distinguishes it from the Fermi liquid or
other types of non-Fermi liquids. Our findings point to a possibly wide class
of gapless quantum phases with unexpected transport and optical properties.

<h3>Transforming from Kitaev to Disguised Ising Chain: Application to  CoNb$_2$O$_6$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14754</a>
<br>
</p><i>Derek Churchill, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<p>For many years, CoNb$_2$O$_6$ has served as an exemplar of the
one-dimensional Ising model. However, recent experimental and theoretical
analyses challenge its applicability to this material. Prior to that, a
tailored spin model for 3d$^7$ systems such as Co$^{2+}$, known as the
$JK\Gamma$ model, has emerged, featuring Heisenberg $(J)$, Kitaev $(K)$, and
Gamma $(\Gamma)$ interactions. While these interactions are permitted by the
symmetry of the system, their role in CoNb$_2$O$_6$ remains enigmatic. We
present a microscopic theory based on spin-orbit entangled J$_{\textrm{eff}}$ =
1/2 states, aimed at elucidating the roles of Kitaev and Gamma interactions in
shaping Ising anisotropy. Leveraging strong coupling theory, we identify a
dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction. Furthermore, by comparing dynamical
structure factors obtained via exact diagonalization with those from inelastic
neutron scattering experiments, we find an antiferromagnetic $\Gamma$
interaction, which dictates the Ising axis and explains the mechanism behind
moment pinning. Our theory suggests that CoNb$_2$O$_6$ represents a rare
one-dimensional Kitaev chain with significant ferromagnetic Kitaev and
antiferromagnetic Gamma interactions.

<h3>Magnonic Superconductivity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14756" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14756</a>
<br>
</p><i>Khachatur G. Nazaryan, Liang Fu</i>
<p>We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced
by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks
a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a
composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and
magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity
with high transition temperature in a triangular lattice Hubbard model with
repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract
to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$
superconductivity.

<h3>Entanglement Hamiltonian for inhomogeneous free fermions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14766" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14766</a>
<br>
</p><i>Riccarda Bonsignori, Viktor Eisler</i>
<p>We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for the ground state of one-dimensional
free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In
particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system
with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field
theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a
half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result
is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with
the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an
excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes
asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient
chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper
continuum limit.

<h3>Percolation connectivity in deposits obtained using competitive random  sequential adsorption of binary disk mixtures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14818</a>
<br>
</p><i>N. I. Lebovka, M. R. Petryk, N. V. Vygornitskii</i>
<p>Connectedness percolation phenomena in the two-dimensional (2D) packing of
binary mixtures of disks with different diameters were studied numerically. The
packings were produced using random sequential adsorption (RSA) model with
simultaneous deposition of disks. The ratio of the particle diameters was
varied within the range $D=1$-$10$, and the selection probability of the small
disks was varied within the range 0-1. A core-shell structure of the particles
was assumed for the analysis of connectivity. The packing coverages in a
jamming state for different components, connectivities through small, large and
both types of disks, the behavior of electrical conductivity were analyzed. The
observed complex effects were explained accounting for the formation of
conductive "bridges" from small disks in pores between large disks.

<h3>Effects of charge and size on the coadsorption of counterionic colloids  in Gibbs monolayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14819</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. M. Gómez-Verdú, B. Martínez-Haya, A. Cuetos</i>
<p>This study uses a coarse-grained Monte Carlo algorithm to model and simulate
the coadsorption of a binary mixture of counterionic colloids in Gibbs
monolayers. These monolayers form at a idealized air-water interface, with one
non-soluble species confined at the interface and the second one partially
soluble in the aqueous phase. The investigation focuses on the effect of
colloidal size and charge on the thermodynamics and microstructure of the
monolayer. We find that the composition of the monolayer evolves non-trivially
with surface coverage, depending on the balance of steric and electrostatic
forces. When the electrostatic interactions are weak, the soluble species is
expelled from the monolayer upon compression, yielding a phase behaviour
particularly sensitive to the relative size of the soluble and non-soluble
colloids. By contrast, strong electrostatic interactions favour the
stabilization of the soluble particles in the monolayer and the formation of
quasi-equimolar fluids, with only a weak dependence on particle size. The
combination of these phenomena results in the formation of a number of
two-dimensional mesoscopic arrangements in the monolayer, ranging from diluted
gas-phase behaviour to domains of aggregates and percolates, and to incipient
crystalline structures.

<h3>Shape changes of a single hairy particle with mobile ligands at a  liquid-liquid interface</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14823" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14823</a>
<br>
</p><i>T. Staszewski, M. Borówko</i>
<p>We investigate rearrangements of a single hairy particle at a liquid-liquid
interface using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We consider the
particles with the same (symmetrical interactions) and different (asymmetrical
interactions) affinity to the liquids. We show how ligand mobility affects the
behavior of the hairy particle at the liquid-liquid interface. We found that
such a hairy particle can take various shapes at the interface. For example, a
Janus-like snowman consisting of a segment cluster and a bare part of the core,
Saturn-like structures, and the core with a wide ``plume'' on one side. A
configuration of the particle at the interface is characterized by the vertical
displacement distance and the orientation of the particle relative to the phase
boundary. The selected descriptors are used to characterize the shape of the
segment cloud. We found that the shape of a particle and its localization at
the interface can be determined by tuning the interactions with the liquids.

<h3>Revisiting the wetting behavior of solid surfaces by water-like models  within a density functional theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14825" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14825</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Kozina, M. Aguilar, O. Pizio, S. Sokołowski</i>
<p>We perform the analysis of predictions of a classical density functional
theory for associating fluids with different association strength concerned
with wetting of solid surfaces. The four associating sites water-like models
with non-associative square-well attraction parametrized by Clark et al. [Mol.
Phys., 2006, 104, 3561] are considered. The fluid-solid potential is assumed to
have a 10-4-3 functional form. The growth of water film on the substrate upon
changing the chemical potential is described. The wetting and prewetting
critical temperatures, as well as the prewetting phase diagram are evaluated
for different fluid-solid attraction strength from the analysis of the
adsorption isotherms. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the contact angle
is obtained from the Young equation. It yields estimates for the wetting
temperature as well. Theoretical findings are compared with experimental
results and in a few cases with data from computer simulations. The theory is
successful and quite accurate in describing the wetting temperature and contact
angle changes with temperature for different values of fluid-substrate
attraction. Moreover, the method provides an easy tool to study other
associating fluids on solids of importance for chemical engineering, in
comparison with laboratory experiments and computer simulations.

<h3>Edge currents as probe of topology in twisted cuprate bilayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14851</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vedangi Pathak, Oguzhan Can, Marcel Franz</i>
<p>Bilayers made of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ assembled with a twist angle close to $45^\circ$
have been recently shown to spontaneously break time reversal symmetry
$\mathcal{T}$, consistent with theoretical predictions for emergent chiral
topological $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ phase in such twisted $d$-wave
superconductors. Here we use a minimal microscopic model to estimate the size
of spontaneous chiral edge currents expected to occur in the
$\mathcal{T}$-broken phase. In accord with previous theoretical studies of
chiral $d$-wave superconductors we find small but non-vanishing edge currents
which we nevertheless predict to be above the detection threshold of the
state-of-the-art magnetic scanning probe microscopy. In addition, by deriving a
simple relation between the edge current and the electron spectral function we
help elucidate the longstanding disparity between the size of edge currents in
chiral $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors.

<h3>Toward a realistic model of multilayered bacterial colonies</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14855</a>
<br>
</p><i>M. T. Khan, J. Cammann, A. Sengupta, E. Renzi, M. G. Mazza</i>
<p>Bacteria are prolific at colonizing diverse surfaces under a widerange of
environmental conditions, and exhibit fascinating examples of self-organization
across scales. Though it has recently attracted considerable interest, the role
of mechanical forces in the collective behavior of bacterial colonies is not
yet fully understood. Here, we construct a model of growing rod-like bacteria,
such as Escherichia coli based purely on mechanical forces. We perform
overdamped molecular dynamics simulations of the colony starting from a few
cells in contact with a surface. As the colony grows, microdomains of strongly
aligned cells grow and proliferate. Our model captures both the initial growth
of a bacterial colony and also shows characteristic signs of capturing the
experimentally observed transition to multilayered colonies over longer
timescales. We compare our results with experiments on E. coli cells and
analyze the statistics of microdomains.

<h3>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</a>
<br>
</p><i>David March-Pons, Ezequiel E. Ferrero, M. Carmen Miguel</i>
<p>We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model
inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for
option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also
considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome
employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with
convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy.
Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects.
In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase
transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in
finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in
the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar
qualities.
Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they
provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options
more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of
perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in
their adherence to different psychophysical laws.

<h3>Description of CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ ferrielectrics in a mixed Ising model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14857" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14857</a>
<br>
</p><i>R. Yevych, V. Liubachko, V. Hryts, M. Medulych, A. Kohutych, Yu. Vysochanskii</i>
<p>The appearance of spontaneous polarization in CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$
ferrielectrics is related to the second order Jahn-Teller effect for copper
cations located in a double-well local potential, the stereoactivity of indium
cations located in a three-well local potential, as well as the valence
fluctuations of phosphorus cations. The paraelectric to ferrielectric phase
transition is primarily determined by the coupling of indium cations with their
surroundings. This transition can be analyzed using the mixed Ising model with
spins $s = 1/2$ and $S = 1$. The spectrum of pseudospin fluctuations at
different temperatures was calculated using a mean-field approach for a set of
quantum anharmonic oscillators. The results were then compared with Raman
spectroscopy data for CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ crystal. The analysis indicates that
the lattice anharmonicity below 150 K, is mainly determined by the indium
sublattice, leading to the coexistence of the glassy state and ferrielectric
phase. Above 150 K, the anharmonicity of the copper sublattice activates the
ionic conductivity and results in the existence of a long-ranged fluctuated
cluster of spontaneous polarization in a temperature interval of the
paraelectric phase above $T_{{C}}$.

<h3>Nonmonotonic relaxation of Campbell penetration depth from  creep-enhanced vortex pinning</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14891</a>

<p>We study the effects of flux creep on the linear AC response of the vortex
lattice in a low-pinning Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_13$ superconductor by measuring the
Campbell penetration depth, $\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$. Thermal
fluctuations release vortices from shallow pinning sites, only for them to
become re-trapped by deeper potential wells, causing an initial increase of the
effective Labusch parameter, which is proportional to the pinning well depth.
This effect cannot be detected in conventional magnetic relaxation measurements
but is revealed by our observation of a nonmonotonic time evolution of
$\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$, which directly probes the average
curvature of the occupied pinning centers. The time evolution of $\lambda_\rm
\scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$ was measured at different temperatures in samples
with different densities of pinning centers produced by electron irradiation.
The $\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$ is hysteretic with a
zero-field-cool warmed (ZFCW) state that exhibits a noticeable nonmonotonic
relaxation but shows a monotonic change in the field-cooled (FC) state. The
curves, measured at different temperatures, can be collapsed together when
plotted on a logarithmic time scale $t \to T\ln(t/t_0)$, quantitatively
corroborating the proposed picture of vortex creep based on the strong pinning
theory.

<h3>Orbital-doublet-driven even spin Chern insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14893" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14893</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lu Liu, Yuntian Liu, Jiayu Li, Hua Wu, Qihang Liu</i>
<p>Quantum spin Hall insulators hosting edge spin currents hold great potential
for low-power spintronic devices. In this work, we present a universal approach
to achieve a high and near-quantized spin Hall conductance plateau within a
sizable bulk gap. Using a nonmagnetic four-band model Hamiltonian, we
demonstrate that an even spin Chern (ESC) insulator can be accessed by tuning
the sign of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within a crystal symmetry-enforced
orbital doublet. With the assistance of a high spin Chern number of $C_{S}=2$
and spin $U$(1) quasi-symmetry, this orbital-doublet-driven ESC phase is
endowed with the near-double-quantized spin Hall conductance. We identify 12
crystallographic point groups supporting such a sign-tunable SOC. Furthermore,
we apply our theory to realistic examples, and show the phase transition from a
trivial insulator governed by positive SOC in RuI$_{3}$ monolayer to an ESC
insulator dominated by negative SOC in RuBr$_{3}$ monolayer. This
orbital-doublet-driven ESC insulator, RuBr$_{3}$, showcases nontrivial
characteristics including helical edge states, near-double-quantized spin Hall
conductance, and robust corner states. Our work provides new pathways in the
pursuit of the long-sought quantum spin Hall insulators.

<h3>High Harmonic Spectroscopy Probes Lattice Dynamics</h3>

<p>The probing of coherent lattice vibrations in solids has been conventionally
carried out using time-resolved transient spectroscopy where only the relative
oscillation amplitude can be obtained. Using time-resolved X-ray techniques,
absolute electron-phonon coupling strength could be extracted. However, the
complexity of such an experiment renders it impossible to be carried out in
conventional laboratories. Here we demonstrate that the electron-phonon,
anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling, and their relaxation dynamics can be probed
in real-time using high-harmonic spectroscopy. Our technique is background-free
and has extreme sensitivity directly in the energy domain. In combination with
the optical deformation potential calculated from density functional
perturbation theory and the absolute energy modulation depth, our measurement
reveals the maximum displacement of neighboring oxygen atoms in {\alpha}-quartz
crystal to tens of picometers in real space. By employing a straightforward and
robust time-windowed Gabor analysis for the phonon-modulated high-harmonic
spectrum, we successfully observe channel-resolved four-phonon scattering
processes in such highly nonlinear interactions. Our work opens a new realm for
accurate measurement of coherent phonons and their scattering dynamics, which
allows for potential benchmarking ab-initio calculations in solids

<h3>A numerical framework for phoretic particles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhe Gou, Alexander Farutin, Chaouqi Misbah</i>
<p>We develop a numerical a framework to study phoretic particle dynamics in two
dimensions. The particles are modeled as chemically active rigid circles, which
can emit or absorb a solute into surrounding fluid. The interaction between
particles and solute induces a slip flow on particle surfaces, and the solute
is advected by the fluid flow and diffuses with a constant diffusivity. The
fluid-structure interaction is resolved by a boundary integral method
accelerated by Ewald-like decomposition. The sharp resolution of moving
boundaries for solute kinetics is performed thanks to an overlapping mesh
method. The framework is validated separately for the Stokes problem and the
advection--diffusion problem, reaching relatively high order of accuracy.
Moreover, we employ the framework to more general problems, including particles
in nearly infinite domain and straight channels, and multiparticle motions.

<h3>An investigation on electronic and magnetic properties of Cr substituted  MoS$_2$ monolayer and multilayers-Hybrid functional calculations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Aloka Ranjan Sahoo, Sharat Chandra</i>
<p>With help of ab initio density functional theory calculation, DFT+U, and
hybrid functional HSE06, we revisit the layer dependent electronic structure
and magnetic properties of pristine and 3d transition metal Cr doped MoS$_2$
monolayer and multilayers. Our results show that the dopant Cr atoms prefer to
stay at nearest neighbor distances. In the multilayers, they prefer to remain
in the outermost surface layers. Matching with the experimental band gap, the
optimized U parameter we report is 4 eV. The band gap of the Cr doped monolayer
is indirect, confirming the experimental observation from photoluminescence
experiments. The HSE06 calculation for Cr doped monolayer shows that the band
gap of doped Cr MoS$_2$ monolayer is indirect and no magnetism is observed.
From the DFT studies, the band gap for the multilayers is indirect, and doping
with Cr does not induce magnetic moments in MoS$_2$ layers. The band gap is
observed to decrease with the multilayer thickness. The strain induced by
substitutional Cr doping at the Mo site transforms the band gap in monolayer
MoS$_2$ from direct to indirect. The defect states are produced within the band
gap region close to the conduction band minimum.

<h3>Faithfulness of Real-Space Renormalization Group Maps</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14955</a>
<br>
</p><i>Katsuya O. Akamatsu, Naoki Kawashima</i>
<p>The behavior of $b=2$ real-space renormalization group (RSRG) maps like the
majority rule and the decimation map was examined by numerically applying RSRG
steps to critical $q=2,3,4$ Potts spin configurations. While the majority rule
is generally believed to work well, a more thorough investigation of the action
of the map has yet to be considered in the literature. When fixing the size of
the renormalized lattice $L_g$ and allowing the source configuration size $L_0$
to vary, we observed that the RG flow of the spin and energy correlation under
the majority rule map appear to converge to a nontrivial model-dependent curve.
We denote this property as "faithfulness", because it implies that some
information remains preserved by RSRG maps that fall under this class.
Furthermore, we show that $b=2$ weighted majority-like RSRG maps acting on the
$q=2$ Potts model can be divided into two categories, maps that behave like
decimation and maps that behave like the majority rule.

<h3>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pascal Naidon</i>
<p>In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the
general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel
parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present
work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters
are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body
observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel
coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy
independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is
surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights
a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic
resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron
resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do
not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced
experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.

<p>Magnetic impurities in superconductors are of increasing interest due to
emergent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states and Majorana zero modes for
fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a direct relationship between the
YSR multiple states and magnetic anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins
remains poorly characterized. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we
resolve systematically individual transition-metal (Fe, Cr and Ni) impurities
induced YSR multiplets as well as their Zeeman effects in K$_3$C$_{60}$
superconductor. The YSR multiplets show identical $d$ orbital-like wave
functions that are symmetry-mismatched to the threefold K$_3$C$_{60}$(111) host
surface, breaking point-group symmetries of the spatial distribution of YSR
bound states in real space. Remarkably, we identify an unprecedented
fermion-parity-preserving quantum phase transition between ground states with
opposite signs of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that can be manipulated by
an external magnetic field. These findings can be readily understood in terms
of anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins, and thus elucidate the
intricate interplay between the magnetic anisotropy and YSR multiplets.

<h3>Rheo-SINDy: Finding a Constitutive Model from Rheological Data for  Complex Fluids Using Sparse Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Takeshi Sato, Souta Miyamoto, Shota Kato</i>
<p>Rheology plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting material
behavior by discovering governing equations that relate deformation and stress,
known as constitutive equations. Despite the critical importance of
constitutive equations in predicting dynamics of complex fluids, a systematic
methodology for deriving these equations from available data has remained a
significant challenge in the field. To overcome the problem, we propose a novel
method named Rheo-SINDy, which employs the sparse identification of nonlinear
dynamics (SINDy) for discovering constitutive models from rheological data.
Rheo-SINDy was applied to five distinct scenarios, including four cases with
well-established constitutive equations and one without predefined equations.
Our results demonstrate that Rheo-SINDy successfully identifies accurate models
for the known constitutive equations and derives physically plausible
approximate models for the scenario with the unknown one. These findings
validate the robustness of Rheo-SINDy in handling real-world data complexities
and underscore its efficacy as a powerful tool for advancing the development of
data-driven approaches in rheology.

<p>This study investigates the suitability of the annealed approximation in
high-dimensional systems characterized by dense networks with quenched link
disorder, employing models of coupled oscillators. We demonstrate that dynamic
equations governing dense-network systems converge to those of the
complete-graph version in the thermodynamic limit, where link disorder
fluctuations vanish entirely. Consequently, the annealed-network systems, where
fluctuations are attenuated, also exhibit the same dynamic behavior in the
thermodynamic limit. However, a significant discrepancy arises in the
incoherent (disordered) phase wherein the finite-size behavior becomes critical
in determining the steady-state pattern. To explicitly elucidate this
discrepancy, we focus on identical oscillators subject to competitive
attractive and repulsive couplings. In the incoherent phase of dense networks,
we observe the manifestation of random irregular states. In contrast, the
annealed approximation yields a symmetric (regular) incoherent state where two
oppositely coherent clusters of oscillators coexist, accompanied by the
vanishing order parameter. Our findings imply that the annealed approximation
should be employed with caution even in dense-network systems, particularly in
the disordered phase.

<h3>Vanishing of Resistivity upon Freezing of Vortex Liquid in Clean  Superconductors</h3>

<p>Superconducting transition, defined as vanishing of the resistivity, under a
magnetic field in a clean bulk type II superconductor with weak sample disorder
is believed to be a reflection of freezing of the vortex liquid to a kind of
vortex solids. This fundamental issue on superconductivity is examined in
detail. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a three-dimensional
(3D) system and through a supplementary study in 2D case, we find that the
resistivity in the weakly disordered 3D case vanishes in a nearly discontinuous
way, reflecting growth of the Bragg peaks on approaching the vortex lattice
melting transition. In contrast, such a sharp decrease of the resistivity does
not clearly appear in the corresponding 2D case. The consequences of this
difference in the vanishing behavior of the resistivity between the 2D and 3D
systems are discussed in relation to available experimental facts.

</p><i>Jacobus Dijkman, Marjolein Dijkstra, René van Roij, Max Welling, Jan-Willem van de Meent, Bernd Ensing</i>
<p>The intrinsic Helmholtz free-energy functional, the centerpiece of classical
density functional theory (cDFT), is at best only known approximately for 3D
systems, which hampers the use of cDFT as a powerful tool for describing the
intricate thermodynamic equilibrium properties and structural aspects of
classical many-body systems. Here we introduce a method for learning a
quasi-exact neural-network approximation of this functional by exclusively
training on a dataset of radial distribution functions. This method based on
pair-correlation matching circumvents the need to sample costly heterogeneous
density profiles in a wide variety of external potentials and hence offers a
pathway to significantly ease the computational demands for future approaches
to extend machine learning for cDFT to arbitrary three-dimensional systems. For
a supercritical 3D Lennard-Jones system we demonstrate that the learned neural
free-energy functional accurately predicts planar inhomogeneous density
profiles under various complex external potentials obtained from simulations,
while simultaneously offering precise thermodynamic predictions far outside the
training regime.

<h3>All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological  ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jingyuan Cui, Kai-Xuan Zhang, Je-Geun Park</i>
<p>Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention
because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few
years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much
smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in
the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time,
realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics
principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known
industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the
device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure
as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and
unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected:
the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and
read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are
physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility
substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our
work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic
applications.

<h3>Super-Planckian radiative heat transfer between coplanar two-dimensional  metals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15036" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15036</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tao Zhu, Yong-Mei Zhang, Jian-Sheng Wang</i>
<p>We use the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate the
radiative heat transfer (RHT) between coplanar two-dimensional (2D) metals via
a tight-binding square lattice model and the Drude model. Our results reveal
that the RHT between coplanar 2D metals is significantly larger than black-body
radiation in both the near and far fields, leading to a global super-Planckian
RHT. As the separation distance increases, the heat flux density exhibits a
rapid decrease in the near field, followed by a slower decrease and eventual
$1/d$ dependence in the far field, while maintaining a much higher magnitude
than black-body radiation. Evanescent waves dominate the heat transfer in the
near field, while propagating waves dominate the far field. Surprisingly, the
propagating heat flux remains almost constant over a wide range of distances,
resulting in a super-Planckian behavior in the far field. The dispersion
relation of the spectrum function reveals distinct contributions from
propagating and evanescent waves, with possible origins from surface plasmon
resonance. These findings provide insights into the unique characteristics of
RHT between coplanar 2D metals and highlight the potential for achieving
enhanced heat transfer beyond the black-body limit, with implications for
thermal management and energy conversion applications.

<h3>Growth of membranes formed by associating polymers at interfaces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15041</a>
<br>
</p><i>Elena N. Govorun, Julien Dupré de Baubigny, Patrick Perrin, Mathilde Reyssat, Nadège Pantoustier, Thomas Salez, C. Monteux</i>
<p>Polymer association at liquid-liquid interfaces is a promising way to
spontaneously obtain soft self-healing membranes. In the case of reversible
bonding between two polymers, the macromolecules are mobile everywhere within
the membrane and they can be absorbed into it at both boundaries due to binding
to macromolecules of the other type. In this work, we develop the theoretical
model of membrane growth based on these assumptions. The asymptotic dependence
of membrane thickness on time as h ~ t^(1/2), as typically observed in
experiments in a stationary regime, reveals an interdiffusion-controlled
process, where the polymer fluxes sustain the polymer absorption at the
membrane boundaries. The membrane growth rate is mainly determined by the
difference in equilibrium compositions at the boundaries, the association
constant, the polymer lengths and mobilities. This model is further used to
describe the growth of hydrogel membranes formed via H-bonding of polymers at
the interface between a solution of poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) in isopropyl
myristate and an aqueous solution of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA). The film
thickness is measured by reflectometric methods. The dependence of thickness on
time can be approximated by the power law t^(beta), where beta= 1/2 for the
PMAA solution at pH=3 and decreases with increasing pH and, hence, ionization
degree. The growth rate slows down about 25 times for 500-nm-thick films at pH
= 5.1 compared to the case of pH = 3. The ionization degree of PMAA solutions
was studied by potentiometric methods. Even a small change in ionization was
found to influence the growth rate of the film. A slowdown of the film growth
for the ionized polymer can be explained by a drop in the composition gradient
in the membrane, as is predicted by the proposed model.

<p>The investigation of the fluctuations in interacting quantum systems at
finite temperatures showcases the ongoing challenges in understanding complex
quantum systems. Recently, atom number fluctuations in weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensates were observed, motivating an investigation of the
thermal component of partially condensed Bose gases. Here, we present a
combined analysis of both components, revealing the presence of fluctuations in
the thermal component. This analysis includes a comprehensive statistical
evaluation of uncertainties in the preparation and parameter estimation of
partially condensed Bose gases. Using Monte Carlo simulations of optical
density profiles, we estimate the noise contributions to the atom number and
temperature estimation of the condensed and thermal cloud, which is generally
applicable in the field of ultracold atoms. Furthermore, we investigate the
specific noise contributions in the analysis of atom number fluctuations and
show that preparation noise in the total atom number leads to an important
technical noise contribution. Subtracting all known noise contributions from
the variance of the atom number in the BEC and thermal component allows us to
improve the estimate of the fundamental peak fluctuations.

<h3>Quantum Valley Hall effect without Berry curvature</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15050" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15050</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rasoul Ghadimi, Chiranjit Mondal, Sunje Kim, Bohm-Jung Yang</i>
<p>The quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) is characterized by the valley Chern
number (VCN) in a way that one-dimensional (1D) chiral metallic states are
guaranteed to appear at the domain walls (DW) between two domains with opposite
VCN for a given valley. Although in the case of QVHE, the total BC of the
system is zero, the BC distributed locally around each valley makes the VCN
well-defined as long as inter-valley scattering is negligible. Here, we propose
a new type of valley-dependent topological phenomenon that occurs when the BC
is strictly zero at each momentum. Such zero Berry curvature (ZBC) QVHE is
characterized by the valley Euler number (VEN) which is computed by integrating
the Euler curvature around a given valley in two-dimensional (2D) systems with
space-time inversion symmetry. 1D helical metallic states can be topologically
protected at the DW between two domains with the opposite VENs when the DW
configuration preserves either the mirror symmetry with respect to the DW or
the combination of the DW space-time inversion , and chiral symmetries. We
establish the fundamental origin of ZBC-QVHE. Also, by combining tight-binding
model study and first-principles calculations, we propose stacked hexagonal
bilayer lattices including h-BX (X=As, P) and large-angle twisted bilayer
graphenes as candidate systems with robust helical DW states protected by VEN.

<h3>Interference patterns of propagating spin wave in spin Hall oscillator  arrays</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mohammad Haidar</i>
<p>In this study, we discuss the observation of spin wave interference generated
by magnetic oscillators. We employ micromagnetic simulations for two coherent
spin Hall nanowire oscillators positioned nearby, horizontally or vertically.
The two nanowires produce circular waves with short wavelengths on the order of
100 nm, which interfere with each other. In the horizontal configuration, the
spin waves exhibit constructive and destructive fringes, indicating
amplification or cancellation of the amplitudes, respectively. The
synchronization of spin waves in the current geometry of the two nanowires is
facilitated by the combination of dipolar field and propagating spin waves.
Additionally, the vertical alignment results in standing spin waves
characterized by multiple antinodes and nodes. These observations are
interpreted using a wave model that incorporates the superposition principle
for each case.

<h3>Uncovering Bound States in the Continuum in InSb nanowire networks</h3>

</p><i>D. Martínez, P. A. Orellana, L. Rosales, J. Dolado, M. Amado, E. Diez, F. Domínguez-Adame, R. P. A. Lima</i>
<p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are exotic, localized states even though
their energy lies in the continuum spectra. Since its discovery in 1929, the
quest to unveil these exotic states in charge transport experiments remains an
active pursuit in condensed matter physics. Here, we study charge transport in
InSb nanowire networks in the ballistic regime and subject to a perpendicular
magnetic field as ideal candidates to observe and control the appearance of
BICs. We find that BICs reveal themselves as distinctive resonances or
antiresonances in the conductance by varying the applied magnetic field and the
Fermi energy. We systematically consider different lead connections in
hashtag-like nanowire networks, finding the optimal configuration that enhances
the features associated with the emergence of BICs. Finally, the investigation
focuses on the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction of InSb on the
occurrence of BICs in nanowire networks. While the interaction generally plays
a detrimental role in the signatures of the BICs in the conductance of the
nanowire networks, it opens the possibility to operate these nanostructures as
spin filters for spintronics. We believe that this work could pave the way for
the unambiguous observation of BICs in charge transport experiments and for the
development of advanced spintronic devices.

<h3>Symmetry, Superposition and Fragmentation in Classical Spin Liquids: A  General Framework and Applications to Square Kagome Magnets</h3>

<br>
</p><i>K.B. Yogendra, Suman Karmakar, Tanmoy Das</i>
<p>Classical magnets offer glimpses of quantum-like features like spin liquids
and fractionalization, promising an analogous construction of superposition and
projective symmetry in classical field theory. While models based on
system-specific spin-ice or soft-spin rules exist, a formal theory for general
classical magnets remains elusive. Here, we introduce a mutatis mutandis
symmetry group construction built from a vector field in a plaquette of
classical spins, demonstrating how classical spins superpose in irreducible
representations (irreps) of the symmetry group. The corresponding probability
amplitudes serve as order parameters and local spins as fragmented excitations.
The formalism offers a many-body vector field representation of diverse ground
states, including spin liquids and fragmented phases described as degenerate
ensembles of irreps. We apply the theory specifically to a frustrated square
Kagome lattice, where spin-ice or soft spin rules are inapt, to describe spin
liquids and fragmented phases, all validated through irreps ensembles and
unbiased Monte Carlo simulation. Our work sheds light on previously unknown
aspects of spin-liquid phases and fragmentation and broadens their applications
to other branches of field theory.

<h3>Luminescence properties and phase transformation of broadband NIR  emitting A2(WO4)3:Cr3+ (A=Al3+, Sc3+) phosphors toward NIR spectroscopy  applications</h3>

<p>The synthesis, structural, and luminescence properties have been carried out
for Cr3+-activated Al2(WO4)3 (AWO) and Sc2(WO4)3 (SWO) phosphors for
application in pc-NIR LED. Upon blue excitation, these compounds are capable of
exhibiting broadband NIR emission stems primarily from 4T2-->4A2 transition in
the range of 670-1200 nm (maxima ~808 nm, FWHM ~140 nm) for AWO:Cr and of
700-1300 nm (maxima ~870 nm, FWHM ~164 nm) for SWO:Cr. The significant shift of
NIR emission is attributed to the substitution of AlO6 with larger ScO6
octahedrons. To gain insight into the luminescence the crystal field strength,
Racah parameters, nephelauxetic effect, and electron-phonon coupling have been
analyzed based on spectroscopic results. The electron-phonon coupling parameter
S for SWO:Cr was determined to be 11.5, twice as large as that for AWO:Cr,
which is in accordance with its strong thermal quenching. The abrupt changes
occurring at 275 K in temperature-dependent luminescence spectra and decay
lifetime of AWO:Cr is associated with temperature-driven phase transformation
from low-temperature monoclinic to high-temperature orthorhombic phase.
Pressure induced amorphization of AWO:Cr at pressures higher than 25 kbar was
confirmed by employing high pressure evolution of Raman spectra. A high-power
NIR pc-LED, fabricated by coating AWO:0.04Cr on a commercial 470 nm LED chip,
shows good performance with an output power of 17.1 mW driven by a current of
320 mA, revealing potential application of studied materials for NIR light

<h3>Spread complexity and dynamical transition in two-mode Bose-Einstein  condensations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Bozhen Zhou, Shu Chen</i>
<p>We study the spread complexity in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations and
unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$
can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation.
When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_c$, we
reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to
higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from
self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the
eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and
the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the
emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$.
In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the
initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point
$\omega_c$. Finally, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the
initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of
the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable.

<p>Near-infrared phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (NIR pc-LEDs) are
compact light sources of great interest for NIR spectroscopy applications.
Beyond typical Cr3+-activated NIR-emitting phosphors, there exists a strong
demand for Cr3+-free alternatives with high efficiency and broadband emission
to rich the landscape of NIR luminescent materials and extend their range of
application fields. Here, we report a series of Fe3+-activated Ca3Ga2Sn3O12
garnet-type phosphors exhibiting broadband NIR emission in the 650-1000 nm
range attributed to 4T1(G)-->6A1(S) transition, with a maximum at 754 nm and a
FWHM of 89 nm upon UV excitation. The spectroscopic results were analyzed
according to the Tanabe-Sugano theory from which the crystal field parameter Dq
and Racah parameters B and C were obtained for the octahedrally coordinated
Fe3+ ion. Notably, the NIR persistent luminescence lasting over 1 h was
detected following UV or X-ray irradiation. The possible mechanism involving
electron traps was proposed to explain the observed persistent luminescence.
Furthermore, a NIR pc-LED was fabricated by coating synthesized phosphor on a
UV chip, and its performance was evaluated to assess its potential suitability
as a NIR light source. Our discovery of novel type of nontoxic Fe3+-activated
broadband NIR luminescence phosphors with efficient NIR persistent luminescence
paves the way for discovering Cr3+-free multifunctional NIR luminescence
materials, thereby expanding their application possibilities.

<br>
</p><i>Hiroyasu Koizumi, Haruki Nakayama, Hayato Taya</i>
<p>A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized
loop currents called, `` spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. We
calculate magnetic fields produced by them for a model of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin films composed of one surface
and two bulk CuO$_2$ bilayers. In this model, bulk CuO$_2$ layers host stable
spin-vortices around small polarons formed from doped holes; they give rise to
a $U(1)$ gauge field described by the Berry connection from many-body wave
functions, and generates the SVILCs. The effect of the gauge field is taken
into account by the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes (PNC-BdG)
formalism. The magnitude of the calculated magnetic field produced by the
SVILCs in the vicinity of the surface ($10a \approx 4$ nm, where $a$ is the
lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) is in the order of mT; thus, may be
detectable by currently available detection methods. The detection of the
SVILCs by the magnetic field measurement may bring about the elucidation of the
cuprate superconductivity, and may also lead to their quantum device
applications, including qubits.

</p><i>Alessio Cucciari, Dionisia Naddeo, Simone Di Cataldo, Lilia Boeri</i>
<p>In this paper we present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of the superconducting
state of NbTi, traditionally considered the main workhorse for many large-scale
superconducting applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, this compound
represents a major challenge for current computational standards in
superconductivity. Using the newly developed SSCHA-MLIP framework, we
demonstrate that anharmonic effects are required to obtain stable phonon
dispersions for the ordered bcc phase, which is unstable at the harmonic level.
We also find that treating the residual Coulomb interaction in the
newly-developed Kukkonen-Overhauser scheme reduces the $T_c$ by more than 20
$\%$ compared to the simple Morel-Anderson approximation. We show that the
unusually large residual discrepancy in $T_c$ with respect to experiment should
be attributed to lattice disorder, which we treat with a simple model of
Boltzmann-averaged supercells. Our results indicate that a quantitative
description of technologically-relevant transition metal alloy superconductors
requires methodological developments to account for lattice disorder that go
beyond the current standards in computational superconductivity.

<p>We report a comprehensive set of density functional theory calculations on
the family of layered antiferromagnetic manganese pnictides (Ba, Ca,
Sr)$\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{(P, As, Sb)}_2$. We characterize all components to the
linear magnetoelectric (ME) tensor $\alpha$ which are parsed into their
contributions from spin and orbital moments for both lattice-mediated and their
clamped-ion electronic analogs. Our main results show that the orbital
magnetization components cannot be neglected in these systems. The ME response
is dominated by electronic effects with total $\alpha$ values exceeding those
of the prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ (i.e. $\alpha \simeq$ 6.79 ps/m
in $\mathrm{BaMn}_2\mathrm{As}_2$). We also identify a strong correlation with
the computed ME susceptibility on pnictogen substitution in the trigonal
subfamily albeit with weaker amplitudes ($\alpha \simeq$ 0.2-1.7 ps/m).
Additionally, we provide the dependence of these predictions on the Hubbard +U
correction, at the level of the local density approximation, which show large
variations on the calculated ME coefficients in the tetragonal compounds
highlighting the role of strong correlation in these compounds.

</p><i>David T. S. Perkins, Alessandro Veneri, Aires Ferreira</i>
<p>Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and
graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the
spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic
theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully
incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of
symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an
accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and
quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like
the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior
of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted,
reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and
yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an
optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and
broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.

<p>In this work, we report the growth of a single mixed Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ layer,
with diverse stoichiometries, on a Ag(111) substrate. The atomic geometry has
been thoroughly investigated by low energy electron diffraction, scanning
tunneling microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, as well
as calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We first determined
that both pure systems (Bi/Ag(111) and Sb/Ag(111)) show similar behaviors: they
form surface alloys with ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$)R30$^\circ$ periodicity for
coverages lower than 1/3 ML, and undergo a dealloying transition for higher
coverages up to 2/3 ML. We then established a simple preparation procedure to
obtain a mixed Bi-Sb overlayer on Ag(111): it is essential to start with a
surface completely covered by either of the two pure surface alloys and then
deposit the other element on it. The energetics derived from DFT calculations
provide insight into the systems preference towards the formation of this
phase, and also predict a pathway to the formation of Bi-rich non-alloyed
phases. The obtained mixed Bi-Sb phase has a lateral atomic arrangement very
similar to the one in the non-alloyed phase observed for Sb on Ag(111), with Sb
and Bi atoms distributed disorderly, and presents a significant vertical
corrugation, promising considerable Rashba effects.

<p>Condense phase molecular systems organize in wide range of distinct molecular
configurations, including amorphous melt and glass as well as crystals often
exhibiting polymorphism, that originate from their intricate intra- and
intermolecular forces. While accurate coarse-grain (CG) models for these
materials are critical to understand phenomena beyond the reach of all-atom
simulations, current models cannot capture the diversity of molecular
structures. We introduce a generally applicable approach to develop CG force
fields for molecular crystals combining graph neural networks (GNN) and data
from an all-atom simulations and apply it to the high-energy density material
RDX. We address the challenge of expanding the training data with relevant
configurations via an iterative procedure that performs CG molecular dynamics
of processes of interest and reconstructs the atomistic configurations using a
pre-trained neural network decoder. The multi-site CG model uses a GNN
architecture constructed to satisfy translational invariance and rotational
covariance for forces. The resulting model captures both crystalline and
amorphous states for a wide range of temperatures and densities.

</p><i>J. Classen-Howes, P. Fendley, A. Pandey, S. A. Parameswaran</i>
<p>We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual
characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has
several markedly different properties for M>2. In particular, it has a large
non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The
states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the
interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads
to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this
fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra
of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain.
We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered
version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M,
using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by
generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and
apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.

<p>The development of new materials typically involves a process of trial and
error, guided by insights from past experimental and theoretical findings. The
inverse design approach for soft-matter systems has the potential to optimize
specific physical parameters such as particle interactions, particle shape, or
composition and packing fraction. This optimization aims to facilitate the
spontaneous formation of specific target structures through self-assembly. In
this study, we expand upon a recently introduced inverse design protocol for
monodisperse systems to identify the required conditions and interactions for
assembling crystal and quasicrystal phases within a binary mixture of two
distinct species. This method utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to identify
the optimal state point and interaction parameters, enabling the self-assembly
of the desired structure. Additionally, we employ a convolutional neural
network (CNN) that classifies different phases based on their diffraction
patterns, serving as a fitness function for the desired structure. Using our
protocol, we successfully inverse design two-dimensional crystalline
structures, including a hexagonal lattice, and a dodecagonal quasicrystal,
within a non-additive binary mixture of hard disks. Finally, we introduce a
symmetry-based order parameter that leverages the encoded symmetry within the
diffraction pattern. This order parameter circumvents the need for training a
CNN, and is used as a fitness function to inverse design an octagonal
quasicrystal.

<h3>Discovery of superconductivity in technetium-borides at moderate  pressures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15283</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xiangru Tao, Aiqin Yang, Yundi Quan, Biao Wan, Shuxiang Yang, Peng Zhang</i>
<p>Advances in theoretical calculations boosted the searches for high
temperature superconductors, such as sulfur hydrides and rare-earth
polyhydrides. However, the required extremely high pressures for stabilizing
these superconductors handicapped further implementations. Based upon thorough
structural searches, we identified series of unprecedented superconducting
technetium-borides at moderate pressures, including TcB (P6$_3$/mmc) with
superconducting transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ = 20.2 K at ambient
pressure and TcB$_2$ (P6/mmm) with $T_{\text{c}}$ = 23.1 K at 20 GPa.
Superconductivity in these technetium-borides mainly originates from the
coupling between the low frequency vibrations of technetium-atoms and the
dominant technetium-4d electrons at the Fermi level. Our works therefore
present a fresh group in the family of superconducting borides, whose
diversified crystal structures suggest rich possibilities in discovery of other
superconducting transition-metal-borides.

<h3>Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative  Schrödinger cat qubits</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kirill Dubovitskii, Denis M. Basko, Julia S. Meyer, Manuel Houzet</i>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite
for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of
residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the
dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of
quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits
are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave
drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent
degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating
frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat
qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on
the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the
conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to
the qubit errors.

<h3>Fine phase control of domain walls in curved nanostripes: from bits to  nits</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15311</a>
<br>
</p><i>Gabriel R. de Andrade Silva, Vagson Luiz de Carvalho Santos, Guilherme Henrique Rezende Bittencourt</i>
<p>We propose a physical mechanism for fine-tuning the phase of a domain wall
around the equilibrium directions involving the application of an external
field and a spin polarized current in opposite directions. In this way, the
position of the domain wall remains unchanged, but its phase can be slightly
modified around the initial equilibrium positions, applying the external
field/current smoothly. We point out a few applications to which this fine
tuning may lead.

<h3>Quantum Fluctuations Suppress the Critical Fields in  BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</h3>

<p>Early efforts to realize exotic quantum ground states in frustrated magnets
focused on frustration arising from the lattice geometry alone. Attention has
shifted to bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, as well as further-neighbor
interactions, on non-geometrically-frustrated lattices due to their greater
versatility. The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a
candidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$)
interactions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively
low levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different
exchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as
quantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out
the intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a
function of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show
that the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte
Carlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal
exchange couplings included. However, the calculated critical fields are
systematically larger than the experimental values. Infinite-DMRG computations
on the quantum model reveal that quantum corrections from a nearby
ferromagnetic state are likely responsible for the suppressed critical fields.
Together, our experiment and theory analyses demonstrate that, while quantum
fluctuations play an important role in determining the phase diagram, most of
the physics of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ can be understood in terms of the
classical dynamics of long-range ordered states, leaving little room for the
possibility of a quantum spin liquid.

<h3>Photonic cross noise spectroscopy of Majorana bound states</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15340</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lena Bittermann, Fernando Dominguez, Patrik Recher</i>
<p>We propose a route to detect Majorana bound states (MBSs) by coupling a
topological superconductor to quantum dots (QDs) in a $pnp$ junction. Here, two
MBSs are coherently coupled to electrons on two QDs, which recombine with holes
to photons. We focus on the spectroscopy of cross-correlated shot noise and the
polarization of the emitted photons. Our detection scheme allows us to probe
the necessary condition for the emergence of MBSs, specifically, the existence
of non-local triplet superconducting correlations and also the fundamental
property that two MBSs comprise a single complex fermion. We compare our
results to the ones obtained from non-topological quasi-MBSs (qMBSs) and
establish a correspondence between the number of peaks in the cross-correlation
with the number of MBSs in the system. Here, we can identify a tunneling regime
that facilitates differentiation between topological MBSs and trivial qMBSs.
Additionally, we test the robustness of the detection scheme by the addition of
uncorrelated particles.

<p>Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures,
highlighting specific features in both 2D systems, such as thin films or curved
surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism
within confined geometries, the contributions from both volume and surface must
be considered, requiring appropriate topological analysis to obtain a complete
view of the system. Here, we consider domain walls in cylindrical magnetic
nanowires to illustrate the use of topological invariants. We begin with
micromagnetic simulations of domain wall transformation under the stimulus of
an \OErsted field, tracking bulk and surface topological signatures, and
analyzing the interplay between multiple micromagnetic objects. For instance,
the extensive analysis allowed us to highlight mechanisms of domain wall type
conversion from topologically non-trivial to trivial states, a phenomenon
disregarded in previous studies. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence
of the transient states predicted to occur during the dynamical process.

<h3>Manipulating carbon related spin defects in boron nitride by changing  the MOCVD growth temperature</h3>

</p><i>Jakub Iwański, Jakub Kierdaszuk, Arkadiusz Ciesielski, Johannes Binder, Aneta Drabińska, Andrzej Wysmołek</i>
<p>A common solution for precise magnetic field sensing is to employ spin-active
defects in semiconductors, with the NV center in diamond as prominent example.
However, the three-dimensional nature of diamond limits the obtainable
proximity of the defect to the sample. Two-dimensional boron nitride, which can
host spin-active defects, can be used to overcome those limitations. In this
work, we study spin properties of sp2-bonded boron nitride layers grown using
Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition at temperatures ranging from 700
{\deg}C to 1200 {\deg}C. With Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) we show that our
layers exhibit spin properties, which we ascribe to carbon related defects.
Supported by photoluminescence and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, we
distinguish three different regimes: (i) growth at low temperatures with no ESR
signal, (ii) growth at intermediate temperatures with a strong ESR signal and a
large number of spin defects, (iii) growth at high temperatures with a weaker
ESR signal and a lower number of spin defects. The observed effects can be
further enhanced by an additional annealing step. Our studies demonstrate
wafer-scale boron nitride that intrinsically hosts spin defects without any ion
or neutron irradiation, which may be employed in spin memories or magnetic
field detectors.

<p>Optical excitation of chiral phonons plays a vital role in studying the
phonon-driven magnetic phenomena in solids. Transition metal dichalcogenides
host chiral phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, providing an
ideal platform to explore the interplay between chiral phonons and valley
degree of freedom. Here, we investigate the helicity-resolved magneto-Raman
response of monolayer MoS2 and identify a doubly degenerate
Brillouin-zone-center chiral phonon mode at ~270 cm-1. Our wavelength- and
temperature-dependent measurements show that this chiral phonon is activated
through the resonant excitation of A exciton. Under an out-of-plane magnetic
field, the chiral phonon exhibits giant Zeeman splitting, which corresponds to
an effective magnetic moment of 2.5mu_B. Moreover, we carry out theoretical
calculations based on the Morphic effects in nonmagnetic crystals, which
reproduce the linear Zeeman splitting and Raman cross-section of the chiral
phonon. Our study provides important insights into lifting the chiral phonon
degeneracy in an achiral covalent material, paving a new route to excite and
control chiral phonons.

<h3>Crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic net magnetization for  MnTe altermagnet candidate</h3>

<p>We experimentally study magnetization reversal curves for MnTe single
crystals, which is the altermagnetic candidate. Above 85~K temperature, we
confirm the antiferromagnetic behavior of magnetization $M$, which is known for
$\alpha$--MnTe. Below 85~K, we observe anomalous low-field magnetization
behavior, which is accompanied by the sophisticated $M(\alpha)$ angle
dependence with beating pattern as the interplay between $M(\alpha)$ maxima and
minima: in low fields, $M(\alpha)$ shows ferromagnetic-like 180$^\circ$
periodicity, while at high magnetic fields, the periodicity is changed to the
90$^\circ$ one. This angle dependence is the most striking result of our
experiment, while it can not be expected for standard magnetic systems. In
contrast, in altermagnets, symmetry allows ferromagnetic behavior only due to
the spin-orbit coupling. Thus, we claim that our experiment shows the effect of
weak spin-orbit coupling in MnTe, with crossover from relativistic to
non-relativistic net magnetization, and, therefore, we experimentally confirm
altermagnetism in MnTe.

<h3>Machine learning-based compression of quantum many body physics: PCA and  autoencoder representation of the vertex function</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15372</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiawei Zang, Matija Medvidović, Dominik Kiese, Domenico Di Sante, Anirvan M. Sengupta, Andrew J. Millis</i>
<p>Characterizing complex many-body phases of matter has been a central question
in quantum physics for decades. Numerical methods built around approximations
of the renormalization group (RG) flow equations have offered reliable and
systematically improvable answers to the initial question -- what simple
physics drives quantum order and disorder? The flow equations are a very high
dimensional set of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution is the two
particle vertex function, a function of three continuous momenta that describes
particle-particle scattering and encodes much of the low energy physics
including whether the system exhibits various forms of long ranged order. In
this work, we take a simple and interpretable data-driven approach to the open
question of compressing the two-particle vertex. We use PCA and an autoencoder
neural network to derive compact, low-dimensional representations of underlying
physics for the case of interacting fermions on a lattice. We quantify errors
in the representations by multiple metrics and show that a simple linear PCA
offers more physical insight and better out-of-distribution (zero-shot)
generalization than the nominally more expressive nonlinear models. Even with a
modest number of principal components (10 - 20), we find excellent
reconstruction of vertex functions across the phase diagram. This result
suggests that many other many-body functions may be similarly compressible,
potentially allowing for efficient computation of observables. Finally, we
identify principal component subspaces that are shared between known phases,
offering new physical insight.

<h3>Magnetic, charge, and bond order in the two-dimensional  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Holstein model</h3>

<p>Most nonperturbative numerical studies of electron-phonon interactions focus
on model Hamiltonians where the electrons interact with a phonon branch via a
single type of microscopic mechanism. Two commonly explored couplings in this
context are the Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) interactions, which
describe phonons modulating the on-site energy and intersite electron hopping,
respectively. Many materials, however, have multiple phonon branches that can
each interact with electronic degrees of freedom in different ways. We present
here a determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled two-dimensional
(bond) SSH-Holstein Hamiltonian, where electrons couple to different phonon
branches via either the Holstein or SSH mechanism. We map the model's phase
diagram and determine the nature of the transitions between charge-density
wave, bond order wave, and antiferromagnetic order.
