<h3>Thermal Fluctuations For a Three-Beads Swimmer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13302</a>
<br>
<i>R. Ferretta, R. Di Leonardo, A. Puglisi</i>
<p>We discuss a micro-swimmer model made of three spheres actuated by an
internal active time-periodic force, tied by an elastic potential and submitted
to hydrodynamic interactions with thermal noise. The dynamical approach we use,
replacing the more common kinetic one, unveils the instability of the original
model and the need of a confining potential to prevent the evaporation of the
swimmer. We investigate the effect of the main parameters of the model, such as
the frequency and phase difference of the periodic active force, the stiffness
of the confining potential, the length of the swimmer and the temperature and
viscosity of the fluid. Our observables of interest are the averages of the
swim velocity, of the energy consumption rate, the diffusion coefficient and
the swimming precision, which is limited by the energy consumption through the
celebrated Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations. An optimum for velocity and
precision is found for an intermediate frequency. Reducing the potential
stiffness, the viscosity or the length, is also beneficial for the swimming
performance, but these parameters are limited by the consistency of the model.
Analytical approximation for many of the interesting observables is obtained
for small deformations of the swimmer. We also discuss the efficiency of the
swimmer in terms of its maximum precision and of the hydrodynamic, or
Lighthill, criterion, and how they are connected.

<h3>Superfluid vortex dynamics in an elliptical boundary</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13545</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo Caldara, Andrea Richaud, Pietro Massignan, Alexander L. Fetter</i>
<p>Recent advances in cold atom platforms, providing experimental accessibility
to real-time dynamics, have renewed interest in the motion of superfluid
vortices in two-dimensional domains. Motivated by this development, we study
the dynamics of a vortex in a two-dimensional incompressible superfluid inside
an elliptical boundary. Employing the Joukowsky conformal map from a circle to
an ellipse, we derive an analytical expression for the complex potential
describing the hydrodynamic flow around the vortex. We integrate the resulting
equations of motion, finding that the vortex moves along a nearly (but not
exactly) elliptical trajectory. In addition, we obtain a simple closed
expression for the vortex self-energy, which serves as the Hamiltonian of the
system.

<h3>MXenes: The key to unlocking the potential metal-ion batteries -- review</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12844</a>
<br>
<i>Negin Mirzaie Dizaji</i>
<p>The invention of next-generation electrochemical energy devices (EEDs) has
led to concerns about range anxiety, long recharge times, and moderate energy
density. The behavior of cells and packs during fast charging depends on
various factors, categorized into charging strategies and new materials. MXenes
have gained significant attention since their discovery in 2011 due to their
unique physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Drexel researchers
explored their use in batteries, where they offer advantages in high rates and
power compared to other energy storage materials. However, the commercial use
of MXenes in large volumes poses a challenge. This paper focuses on the
structure, synthesis, and applications of MXenes in metal-ion batteries.

<h3>Electronic structure of CrO$_2$ probed by NMR and DFT</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12846</a>
<br>
<i>Vojtěch Chlan, Anna A. Shmyreva, Helena Štěpánková</i>
<p>Electronic structure of ferromagnetic half-metal CrO$_2$ was studied by means
of 53Cr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and density functional
theory (DFT). The measured NMR spectrum consists of three distinct spectral
lines and is interpreted as a triplet arising due to electric quadrupole
interaction. The observed NMR parameters agree well with those obtained from
electronic structure calculations, corresponding to the presence of Cr$^{4+}$
with fully occupied localized dxy singlet and partially occupied degenerated
dxz and dyz states, as required by ferromagnetic double exchange mechanism.
With high accuracy the orbital occupations and valence states of all Cr atoms
within the CrO$_2$ structure are found uniform.

<h3>Extension of Radiative Transfer Coherent Backscattering RT-CB code to  dense discrete random media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12851</a>
<br>
<i>Johannes Markkanen, Antti Penttilä</i>
<p>The Radiative transfer coherent backscattering (RT-CB) code is extended to
apply to dense discrete random media of optically soft spherical particles.
This is achieved by utilizing the well-known static-structure-factor (SSF)
correction derived from the Percus-Yevick approximation for sticky-hard-sphere
(SHS) pair correlation function. The code is verified against the numerically
exact electromagnetic method for small spherical media consisting of
submicrometer-sized icy particles at optical wavelengths. The SSF-corrected
RT-CB method significantly improves solution accuracy, and the solution agrees
well with the numerically exact solution when the packing density is less than
20% and particles are optically soft, i.e., the refractive index of particles
is close to that of the background medium.

<h3>Edge-pinning effect of graphene nanoflakes sliding atop graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12853</a>
<br>
<i>Yingchao Liu, Jinlong Ren, Decheng Kong, Guangcun Shan, Kunpeng Dou</i>
<p>Edge effect is one of the detrimental factors preventing superlubricity in
laminar solid lubricants. Separating the friction contribution from the edge
atom and inner atom is of paramount importance for rational design of ultralow
friction across scales in van der Waals heterostructures. To decouple these
contributions and provide the underlying microscopic origin at the atomistic
level, we considered two contrast models, namely, graphene nanoflakes with
dimerized and pristine edges sliding on graphene monolayer based on extensive
ab initio calculations. We found the edge contribution to friction is lattice
orientation dependence. In particular, edge pinning effect by dimerization is
obvious for misaligned contact but suppressed in aligned lattice orientation.
The former case providing local commensuration along edges is reminiscent of
Aubry's pinned phase and the contribution of per edge carbon atom to the
sliding potential energy corrugation is even 1.5 times more than that of an
atom in bilayer graphene under commensurate contact. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that the dimerized edges as high frictional pinning sites are
robust to strain engineering and even enhanced by fluorination. Both structural
and chemical modification in the tribological system constructed here offers
the atomic details to dissect the undesirable edge pinning effect in layered
materials which may give rise to the marked discrepancies in measured friction
parameters from the same superlubric sample or different samples with the same
size and identical preparation.

<h3>Density of States Prediction of Crystalline Materials via Prompt-guided  Multi-Modal Transformer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12856" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12856</a>
<br>
<i>Namkyeong Lee, Heewoong Noh, Sungwon Kim, Dongmin Hyun, Gyoung S. Na, Chanyoung Park</i>
<p>The density of states (DOS) is a spectral property of crystalline materials,
which provides fundamental insights into various characteristics of the
materials. While previous works mainly focus on obtaining high-quality
representations of crystalline materials for DOS prediction, we focus on
predicting the DOS from the obtained representations by reflecting the nature
of DOS: DOS determines the general distribution of states as a function of
energy. That is, DOS is not solely determined by the crystalline material but
also by the energy levels, which has been neglected in previous works. In this
paper, we propose to integrate heterogeneous information obtained from the
crystalline materials and the energies via a multi-modal transformer, thereby
modeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystalline
materials and various energy levels for DOS prediction. Moreover, we propose to
utilize prompts to guide the model to learn the crystal structural
system-specific interactions between crystalline materials and energies.
Extensive experiments on two types of DOS, i.e., Phonon DOS and Electron DOS,
with various real-world scenarios demonstrate the superiority of
DOSTransformer.

<h3>Moiré Fractional Chern Insulators II: First-principles Calculations  and Continuum Models of Rhombohedral Graphene Superlattices</h3>

<i>Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Yuzhi Wang, Jiaxuan Liu, Pok Man Tam, Ziyue Qi, Yujin Jia, Dmitri K. Efetov, Oskar Vafek, Nicolas Regnault, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Jiabin Yu</i>
<p>The experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in
rhombohedral pentalayer graphene twisted on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has
preceded theoretical prediction. Supported by large-scale first principles
relaxation calculations at the experimental twist angle of $0.77^\circ$, we
obtain an accurate continuum model of $n=3,4,5,6,7$ layer rhombohedral
graphene-hBN moir\'e systems. Focusing on the pentalayer case, we analytically
explain the robust $|C|=0,5$ Chern numbers seen in the low-energy
single-particle bands and their flattening with displacement field, making use
of a minimal two-flavor continuum Hamiltonian derived from the full model. We
then predict nonzero valley Chern numbers at the $\nu = -4,0$ insulators
observed in experiment. Our analysis makes clear the importance of displacement
field and the moir\'e potential in producing localized "heavy fermion" charge
density in the top valence band, in addition to the nearly free conduction
band. Lastly, we study doubly aligned devices as additional platforms for
moir\'e FCIs with higher Chern number bands.

<h3>Controlled expansion for transport in a class of non-Fermi liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12922</a>
<br>
<i>Zhengyan Darius Shi</i>
<p>Non-Fermi liquids arise when strong interactions destroy stable fermionic
quasiparticles. The simplest models featuring this phenomenon involve a Fermi
surface coupled to fluctuating gapless bosonic order parameter fields, broadly
referred to as "Hertz-Millis" models. We revisit a controlled approach to
Hertz-Millis models that combines an expansion in the inverse number ($N$) of
fermion species with an expansion in the deviation of the boson dynamical
critical exponent $z$ from 2. The structure of the expansion is found to be
qualitatively different in the quantum critical regime $\Omega \ll q$ and in
the transport regime $\Omega \gg q$. In particular, correlation functions in
the transport regime involve infinitely many diagrams at each order in
perturbation theory. We provide an explicit and tractable recipe to classify
and resum these diagrams. For the simplest Hertz-Millis models, we show that
this recipe is consistent with non-perturbative anomaly arguments and correctly
captures the fixed point optical conductivity as well as leading corrections
from irrelevant operators. We comment on potential applications of this
expansion to transport in more complicated Hertz-Millis models as well as
certain beyond-Landau metallic quantum critical points.

<h3>Sampling-accelerated First-principles Prediction of Phonon Scattering  Rates for Converged Thermal Conductivity and Radiative Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12935</a>
<br>
<i>Ziqi Guo, Zherui Han, Dudong Feng, Guang Lin, Xiulin Ruan</i>
<p>First-principles prediction of thermal conductivity and radiative properties
is crucial. However, computing phonon scattering, especially for four-phonon
scattering, could be prohibitively expensive, and the thermal conductivity even
for silicon was still under-predicted and not converged in the literature. Here
we propose a method to estimate scattering rates from a small sample of
scattering processes using maximum likelihood estimation. The computational
cost of estimating scattering rates and associated thermal conductivity and
radiative properties is dramatically reduced by over 99%. This allows us to use
an unprecedented q-mesh of 32*32*32 for silicon and achieve a converged thermal
conductivity value that agrees much better with experiments. The accuracy and
efficiency of our approach make it ideal for the high-throughput screening of
materials for thermal and optical applications.

<h3>Controlled Interlayer Exciton Ionization in an Electrostatic Trap in  Atomically Thin Heterostructures</h3>

<p>Atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures provide a two-dimensional (2D)
device platform for creating high densities of cold, controllable excitons.
Interlayer excitons (IEs), bound electrons and holes localized to separate 2D
quantum well layers, have permanent out-of-plane dipole moments and long
lifetimes, allowing their spatial distribution to be tuned on demand. Here, we
employ electrostatic gates to trap IEs and control their density. By
electrically modulating the IE Stark shift, electron-hole pair concentrations
above $2\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be achieved. At this high IE density, we
observe an exponentially increasing linewidth broadening indicative of an IE
ionization transition, independent of the trap depth. This runaway threshold
remains constant at low temperatures, but increases above 20 K, consistent with
the quantum dissociation of a degenerate IE gas. Our demonstration of the IE
ionization in a tunable electrostatic trap represents an important step towards
the realization of dipolar exciton condensates in solid-state optoelectronic
devices.

<h3>Spectroscopy of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot from  time-resolved charge detection</h3>

<p>We measured the spectrum of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot as
a function of both parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields, using a
time-resolved charge detection technique that gives access to individual tunnel
events. Thanks to our unprecedented energy resolution of 4$\mu~$eV, we could
distinguish all four levels of the dot's first orbital, in particular in the
range of magnetic fields where the first and second excited states cross
($B_\perp\lesssim 100~$mT). We thereby experimentally establish, the hitherto
extrapolated, single-charge carrier spectrum picture and provide a new upper
bound for the inter-valley mixing, equal to our energy resolution.

<h3>Magneto-interferometry of multiterminal Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12964</a>
<br>
<i>Régis Mélin, Clemens B. Winkelmann, Romain Danneau</i>
<p>We report a theoretical study of multiterminal Josephson junctions under the
influence of a magnetic field $B$. We consider a ballistic rectangular
two-dimensional metal $N_0$ connected by the edges to the left, right, top and
bottom superconductors $S_L$, $S_R$, $S_T$ and $S_B$, respectively. We
numerically calculate in the long-junction limit the critical current $I_c$
versus $B$ between $S_L$ and $S_R$ for various aspect ratios, with $S_T$ and
$S_B$ playing the role of superconducting mirrors. We find $I_c$ to be enhanced
by orders of magnitude, especially at long distance, due to the phase rigidity
provided by the mirrors. We obtain superconducting quantum interference
device-like magnetic oscillations. With symmetric couplings, the
self-consistent superconducting phase variables of the top and bottom mirrors
take the values $0$ or $\pi$, as for emerging Ising degrees of freedom. We
propose a simple effective Josephson junction circuit model that is compatible
with these microscopic numerical calculations. From the $I_c(B)$ patterns we
infer where the supercurrent flows in various device geometries. In particular
in the elongated geometry, we show that the supercurrent flows between all
pairs of contacts, which allows exploring the full phase space of the relevant
phase differences.

<h3>Effect of (001) and (111) Epitaxial Strain on \emph{Pnma} Perovskite  Oxides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12969" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12969</a>
<br>
<i>Amartyajyoti Saha, Turan Birol</i>
<p>With recent advances in strain engineering and its widespread applications,
it is becoming increasingly important to understand the effect of biaxial
strain on the most common structural phase of perovskites -- the orthorhombic
$Pnma$ structure. In this work, by using a combination of group theory and
first principles density functional theory, we study the effect of biaxial
strain on (001) and (111)-oriented CaTiO$_3$, SrSnO$_3$ and SrZrO$_3$ films. We
observe manifestly different behaviors depending on the strain orientation,
with common trends emerging between different materials. In addition to many
different structural phases observed in individual compounds before, we
identify a transition between two different phases with the same space group
name ($P2_1/c$) but different symmetries in (111)-strained materials. We also
find that allowing the relaxation of the out-of-plane monoclinic angles, often
ignored in first principles studies, lead to significant stabilization of
certain phases and is essential to correctly determine the structural ground
state.

<h3>Deformation Dynamics of Nanopores upon Water Imbibition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13025" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13025</a>
<br>
<i>Juan Sanchez, Lars Dammann, Laura Gallardo, Zhuoqing Li, Michael Fröba, Robert Meissner, Howard A. Stone, Patrick Huber</i>
<p>Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is ubiquitous in nature and
is of increasing importance for the functionality of modern liquid-infused
engineering materials. During imbibition, highly curved menisci are driven by
negative Laplace pressures of several hundred atmospheres, exerting an enormous
contractile load on an increasing portion of the porous matrix. Due to the
challenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high
spatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid
capillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in
mesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution
dilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction,
we find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length
increase when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent
when we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic
imbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for water transport and
transpiration in plants. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by
single-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum
model that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore
walls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace
pressures as nanoscale menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our
model predicts that these observations are valid not only for water imbibition
in silica, but for any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the
liquid/solid combination. This also suggests that simple deformation
measurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or
transport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.

<h3>Anisotropic Optical Conductivity Accompanied by a Small Energy Gap in  One-Dimensional Thermoelectric Telluride Ta4SiTe4</h3>

<i>Fumiya Matsunaga, Yoshihiko Okamoto, Yasunori Yokoyama, Kanji Takehana, Yasutaka Imanaka, Yuto Nakamura, Hideo Kishida, Shoya Kawano, Kazuyuki Matsuhira, Koshi Takenaka</i>
<p>We investigated the optical properties of single crystals of one-dimensional
telluride Ta4SiTe4, which shows high thermoelectric performance below room
temperature. Optical conductivity estimated from reflectivity spectra indicates
the presence of a small energy gap of 0.1-0.15 eV at the Fermi energy. At the
lowest energy, optical conductivity along the Ta4SiTe4 chain is an order of
magnitude higher than that perpendicular to this direction, reflecting the
anisotropic electron conduction in Ta4SiTe4. These results indicate that
coexistence of a very small band gap and anisotropic electron conduction is a
promising strategy to develop a high-performance thermoelectric material for
low temperature applications.

<h3>Voltage Control of Electromagnetic Properties in Antiferromagnetic  Materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Xinyi Xu, Yuriy G. Semenov, Ki Wook Kim</i>
<p>Dynamic modulation of electromagnetic responses is theoretically examined in
dielectric antiferromagnets. While both magneto-electric and magneto-elastic
coupling can achieve robust electrical control of magnetic anisotropy, the
latter is considered in a bilayer structure with a piezoelectric material.
Numerical calculations based on the frequency-dependent permeability tensor
clearly illustrate that the anisotropy profile in the typical uniaxial or
biaxial antiferromagnets such as NiO and Cr2O3 can be modified sufficiently to
induce a shift in the resonance frequency by as much as tens of percent in the
sub-mm wavelength range (thus, an electrically tunable bandwidth over 10's of
GHz). The polarization of the electromagnetic response is also affected due to
the anisotropic nature of the effect, offering a possibility to encode the
signal. The intrinsic delay in switching may be minimized to the ns level by
using a sufficiently thin antiferromagnets. Application to specific devices
such as a band-pass filter further illustrates the validity of the concept.

<h3>Mechanistic Insights into the Hydrazine-induced Chemical Reduction  Pathway of Graphene Oxide</h3>

<i>Shu Chen, Jianqiang Guo</i>
<p>Hydrazine stands out as the most generally used chemical-reducing agent for
reducing graphene oxide. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical
investigations into the reduction reaction, the reduction mechanism remains
unclear. In this study, we propose that, in aqueous hydrazine solutions, both
hydrazine and hydroxide ions could initiate the reduction of graphene oxide. We
introduce a chemical reaction pathway involving C-H cleavage and a
dehydroxylation process for the reduction of graphene oxide. By utilizing
density functional theory calculations, the reduction reactions mediated by
hydrazine and hydroxide ions are separately investigated. The reaction routes
on the basal plane and edge regions of graphene oxide are discussed
independently. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the
proposed mechanism is both thermodynamically and dynamically feasible. This
work might contribute to an atomic-level comprehension of a longstanding
challenge in the field of graphene oxide.

<h3>Quantum-spin-liquid state in kagome  YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{1-x}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_{y}$]: The role of  alternate-bond hexagons and beyond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13089" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13089</a>
<br>
<i>Aini Xu, Bo Liu, Zhenyuan Zeng, Liqin Yan, Shiliang Li</i>
<p>Quantum spin liquids are exotic states of spin systems characterized by
long-range entanglement and emergent fractionalized quasiparticles. One of the
challenges in identifying quantum spin liquids in real materials lies in
distinguishing them from trivial paramagnetic states. Here we studied the
magnetic properties of a kagome system
YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{1-x}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_{y}$]. In this system, some of
the hexagons exhibit alternate bonds along the Cu-O-Cu exchange paths, while
others remain uniform. We found that a long-range antiferromagnetic order
emerges when uniform hexagons dominate. However, when the order disappears due
to the increase number of alternate-bond hexagons, two different types of
paramagnetic states are found. Interestingly, even though their proportions of
alternate-bond hexagons are similar, these two paramagnetic states exhibit
dramatically different low-temperature specific-heat behaviors, which can be
attributed to the properties of a quantum-spin-liquid state versus a trivial
paramagnetic state. Our results demonstrate that the formation of the quantum
spin liquid in this system is accompanied by a substantial increase of
low-energy entropy, likely arising from emergent fractionalized quasiparticles.
Thus, this system provides a unique platform for studying how to differentiate
a quantum spin liquid from a trivial paramagnetic state.

<h3>Extensibility governs the flow-induced alignment of polymers and  rod-like colloids</h3>

<i>Vincenzo Calabrese, Tatiana Porto Santos, Carlos G. Lopez, Minne Paul Lettinga, Simon J. Haward, Amy Q. Shen</i>
<p>Polymers and rod-like colloids (PaRC) adopt a favorable orientation under
sufficiently strong flows. However, how the flow kinematics affect the
alignment of such nanostructures according to their extensibility remains
unclear. By analysing the shear- and extension-induced alignment of chemically
and structurally different PaRC, we show that extensibility is a key
determinant of the structural response to the imposed kinematics. We propose a
unified description of the effectiveness of extensional flow, compared to
shearing flow, at aligning PaRC of different extensibility.

<i>Yuri D Glinka</i>
<p>2D materials are considered a key element in the development of
next-generation electronics (nanoelectronics) due to their extreme thickness in
the nanometer range and unique physical properties. The ultrafast dynamics of
photoexcited carriers in such materials is strongly influenced by their
interfaces, since the thickness of 2D materials is much smaller than the
typical depth of light penetration into them and the mean free path of
photoexcited carriers. The resulting collisions of photoexcited carriers with
interfacial potential barriers of 2D materials in the presence of a strong
laser field significantly alter the overall dynamics of photoexcitation,
allowing laser light to be directly absorbed by carriers in the
conduction/valence band through the inverse bremsstrahlung mechanism. The
corresponding ultrafast carrier dynamics can be monitored using
multiphoton-pumped UV-Vis transient absorption spectroscopy. In this review, we
discuss the basic concepts and recent applications of this spectroscopy for a
variety of 2D materials, including transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers,
topological insulators, and other 2D semiconductor structures.

<p>We have previously found experimental evidence for several quantum phenomena
in oxygen-ion implanted of hydrogenated graphite: ferromagnetism,
antiferromagnetism, paramagentism, triplet superconductivity, Andreev states,
Little-Parks oscillations, Lamb shift, Casimir effect, colossal
magnetoresistance, and topologically-protected flat-energy bands [1-6]. Triplet
superconductivity results in the formation of Josephson junctions, thus with
potential of being used for spintronics applications in the critical area of
quantum computing. In this paper, we are showing new experimental evidence for
the formation of two-dimensional (2D) spin waves in oxygen-ion enriched and in
hydrogenated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. The temperature evolution of
the remanent magnetization Mrem(T) data confirms the formation of spin waves
that follow the 2D Heisenberg model with a weak uniaxial anisotropy. In
addition, the step-like features also found in the temperature dependence of
the electrical resistivity between insulating and metallic states suggest
several outstanding possibilities, such as a structural transition, triplet
superconductivity, and chiral properties.

<p>Skyrmions and antiskyrmions are nanoscale swirling textures of magnetic
moments formed by chiral interactions between atomic spins in magnetic
non-centrosymmetric materials and multilayer films with broken inversion
symmetry. These quasiparticles are of interest for use as information carriers
in next-generation, low-energy spintronic applications. To develop
skyrmion-based memory and logic, we must understand skyrmion-defect
interactions with two main goals -- determining how skyrmions navigate
intrinsic material defects and determining how to engineer disorder for optimal
device operation. Here, we introduce a tunable means of creating a
skyrmion-antiskyrmion system by engineering the disorder landscape in FeGe
using ion irradiation. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe
films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions at varying fluences, inducing amorphous
regions within the crystalline matrix. Using low-temperature electrical
transport and magnetization measurements, we observe a strong topological Hall
effect with a double-peak feature that serves as a signature of skyrmions and
antiskyrmions. These results are a step towards the development of information
storage devices that use skyrmions and anitskyrmions as storage bits and our
system may serve as a testbed for theoretically predicted phenomena in
skyrmion-antiskyrmion crystals.

<i>Chihiro Ishii, Yositake Takane</i>
<p>We focus on a scenario of non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence that
uses a topological invariant defined in a bulk geometry under a modified
periodic boundary condition. Although this has succeeded in describing the
topological nature of various one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, its
application to two-dimensional systems has been limited to a non-Hermitian
Chern insulator. Here, we adapt the scenario to a non-Hermitian quantum
spin-Hall insulator to extend its applicability. We show that it properly
describes the bulk--boundary correspondence in the non-Hermitian quantum
spin-Hall insulator. A phase diagram derived from the bulk--boundary
correspondence is shown to be consistent with spectra of the system under an
open boundary condition.

<h3>Stripe magnetic order and field-induced quantum criticality in the  perfect triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CsCeSe$_2$</h3>

<p>The two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) is a textbook
example of frustrated magnetic systems. Despite its simplicity, the TLAF model
exhibits a highly rich and complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring numerous
distinct ground states that can be stabilized through frustrated next-nearest
neighbor couplings or anisotropy. In this paper, we report low-temperature
magnetic properties of the TLAF material CsCeSe$_2$. The inelastic neutron
scattering (INS) together with specific heat measurements and density
functional theory calculations of crystalline electric field suggest that the
ground state of Ce ions is a Kramers doublet with strong easy-plane anisotropy.
Elastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrate the presence of stripe-$yz$
magnetic order that develops below $T_{\rm N} = 0.35$ K, with the zero-field
ordered moment of $m_{\rm Ce} \approx 0.65~\mu_{\rm B}$. Application of
magnetic field first increases the ordering temperature by about 20% at the
intermediate field region and eventually suppresses the stripe order in favor
of the field-polarized ferromagnetic state via a continuous quantum phase
transition (QPT). The field-induced response demonstrates sizable anisotropy
for different in-plane directions, $\mathbf{B}\parallel{}\mathbf{a}$ and
$\mathbf{B}\perp{}\mathbf{a}$, which indicates the presence of bond-dependent
coupling in the spin Hamiltonian. We further show theoretically that the
presence of anisotropic bond-dependent interactions can change the universality
class of QPT for $\mathbf{B}\parallel{}\mathbf{a}$ and
$\mathbf{B}\perp{}\mathbf{a}$.

<p>The extraordinary properties of the Kitaev model have motivated an intense
search for new physics in materials that combine geometrical and bond
frustration. In this work, we employ inelastic neutron scattering, spin wave
theory, and exact diagonalization to study the spin dynamics in the perfect
triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) CsCeSe$_2$. This material orders into
a stripe phase, which is demonstrated to arise as a consequence of the
off-diagonal bond-dependent terms in the spin Hamiltonian. By studying the spin
dynamics at intermediate fields, we identify an interaction between the
single-magnon state and the two-magnon continuum that causes decay of coherent
magnon excitations, level repulsion, and transfer of spectral weight to the
continuum that are controlled by the strength of the magnetic field. Our
results provide a microscopic mechanism for the stabilization of the stripe
phase in TLAF and show how complex many-body physics can be present in the spin
dynamics in a magnet with strong Kitaev coupling even in an ordered ground
state.

<p>The rapid development of infrared spectroscopy, observational astronomy, and
scanning near-field microscopy has been enabled by the emergence of sensitive
mid- and far-infrared photodetectors. Owing to their exceptional
signal-to-noise ratio and fast photoresponse, superconducting hot-electron
bolometers (HEBs) have become a critical component in these applications. While
superconducting HEBs are traditionally made from sputtered superconducting thin
films like Nb or NbN, the potential of layered van der Waals (vdW)
superconductors is untapped at THz frequencies. Here, we report the fabrication
of superconducting HEBs out of few-layer NbSe$_2$ microwires. By improving the
interface between NbSe$_2$ and metal leads connected to a broadband antenna, we
overcome the impedance mismatch between this vdW superconductor and the radio
frequency (RF) readout circuitry that allowed us to achieve large responsivity
THz detection over the range from 0.13 to 2.5 THz with minimum noise equivalent
power of 7~pW$\sqrt{Hz}$. Using the heterodyne sub-THz mixing technique, we
reveal that NbSe$_2$ superconducting HEBs are relatively fast and feature a
characteristic response time in the nanosecond range limited by the slow heat
escape to the bath through a SiO$_2$ layer, on which they are assembled, in
agreement with energy relaxation model. Our work expands the family of
materials for superconducting HEBs technology, reveals NbSe$_2$ as a promising
platform, and offers a reliable protocol for the in-lab production of custom
bolometers using the vdW assembly technique.

<h3>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</h3>

<i>Yun-Tak Oh, Jung Hoon Han, Hyun-Yong Lee</i>
<p>We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model (DBHM)
in one dimension where the boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation
and show fractonic dynamics. Quench processes that start deep in the Mott phase
and end in the weak Mott phase show light-cone-like spreading in the dipole
correlation function but not in the single-boson correlator, which is
suppressed due to the dipole conservation. The phase and the group velocities
estimated from the dilute-dipolon approximation are in excellent agreement with
those of exact numerical diagonalization. The quench from dipoled-condensed
(DC) phase to the Mott phase shows periodic kinks in the Loschmidt echo and the
demise and revival of Bose-condensed peaks in the dipole momentum distribution
function, both of which are noted features of dynamical quantum phase
transition. The Mott-to-DC quench, on the other hand, shows none of these
features despite the quench parameters varying across the equilibrium quantum
critical point. Our findings on the fractonic quench dynamics can be checked in
the tilted optical lattice experiment.

<h3>Fractional quantum Hall interface induced by geometric singularity</h3>

<br>

<p>The geometric response of quantum Hall liquids is an important aspect to
understand their topological characteristics in addition to the electromagnetic
response. According to the Wen-Zee theory, the topological spin is coupled to
the curvature of the space in which the electrons reside. The presence of
conical geometry provides a local isolated geometric singularity, making it
suitable for exploring the geometric response. In the context of
two-dimensional electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field, each Landau orbit
occupies the same area. The cone geometry naturally provides a structure in
which the distances between two adjacent orbits gradually change and can be
easily adjusted by altering the tip angle. The presence of a cone tip
introduces a geometric singularity that affects the electron density and
interacts with the motion of electrons, which has been extensively studied.
Furthermore, this type of geometry can automatically create a smooth interface
or crossover between the crystalline charge-density-wave state and the
liquid-like fractional quantum Hall state. In this work, the properties of this
interface are studied from multiple perspectives, shedding light on the
behavior of quantum Hall liquids in such geometric configurations.

<p>The field of lead halide perovskite nanocrystal doping has witnessed notable
progress in recent times, leading to the creation of innovative materials that
showcase compelling physical characteristics and hold substantial technological
promise. The true characteristics of these materials lie in the presence of
dopant-carrier magnetic exchange interactions. This work presents the first
direct observation of such exchange interactions in colloidal Mn-doped
CsPbX$_3$ (X= Cl, Br) quantum dots (QDs). Here, we employ magnetic circular
dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy to unambiguously demonstrate the successful doping
and the presence of giant excitonic Zeeman splitting in CsPbX$_3$ (X= Cl, Br)
QDs doped with Mn$^2$$^+$. The controllable tuning of effective exciton
g-factors (g$_e$$_f$$_f$) within the range of 2.1 to (-)314 has been achieved
through the process of doping with 6.9 % Mn in CsPbCl$_3$, which will

<h3>Effects of magnetic fields and orbital angular momentum on excitonic  condensation in two-orbital Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13191" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13191</a>
<br>
<i>Ryota Koga, Joji Nasu</i>
<p>We investigate the magnetic-field effects on a two-orbital Hubbard model that
describes multiple spin states. Cobalt oxides have been investigated as
materials possessing spin-state degrees of freedom due to the interplay between
the Hund coupling interaction and crystalline field effect. In the competing
region, quantum hybridizations between distinct spin states are expected to
emerge, corresponding to excitonic condensation. Applied magnetic fields could
also induce such a competition. To understand magnetic-field effects on
excitonic condensation in multi-orbital systems, it is crucial to account for
contributions from both spin and orbital degrees of freedom to magnetic
properties. Here, we study field-induced phenomena in the two-orbital Hubbard
model by focusing on the role of the orbital angular momentum. We
comprehensively analyze this model on a square lattice employing the
Hartree-Fock approximation. Omitting contributions from the orbital moment, we
find that an applied magnetic field gives rise to two excitonic phases, besides
the spin-state ordered phase, between the nonmagnetic low-spin and
spin-polarized high-spin phases. One of these excitonic phases manifests a
staggered-type spin-state order, interpreted as an excitonic supersolid state.
Conversely, the other phase is not accompanied by it and exhibits only a spin
polarization due to the applied magnetic field. When spin-orbit coupling is
present, this phase displays a ferrimagnetic spin alignment attributed to spin
anisotropy. Our analysis also reveals that incorporating the contribution of
the orbital magnetic moment to the Zeeman term significantly alters the overall
structure of the phase diagram. Notably, the orbital magnetization destabilizes
the excitonic phase in contrast to scenarios without this contribution. We also
discuss the relevance of our findings to real materials, such as cobalt oxides.

<h3>Reshaping and Enzymatic Activity allow Viruses to move through the Mucus</h3>

<p>Filamentous viruses like influenza and torovirus often display systematic
bends and arcs of mysterious physical origin. We propose that such viruses
undergo an instability from a cylindrically symmetric to a toroidally curved
state. This "toro-elastic" state emerges via a spontaneous symmetry breaking
under prestress, induced via short range spike protein interactions and
magnified by the filament's surface topography. Once surface stresses become
sufficiently large, the filament buckles and the toroidal, curved state
constitutes a soft mode that can propagate through the filament's material
frame around a "mexican-hat" potential. In the mucus of our airways, glycan
chains are omnipresent that influenza's spike proteins can bind to and cut. We
show that when coupled to such a non-equilibrium chemical reaction, the curved
toro-elastic state can attain a spontaneous rotation for sufficiently strong
enzymatic activity, leading to a whole body reshaping propulsion similar to --
but different from -- eukaryotic flagella and spirochetes.

<p>Time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (tr-POT) offers unique
possibilities for tracing molecular electron dynamics. The recorded
pump-induced changes of the angle-resolved photoemission intensities allow to
characterize unoccupied molecular states in momentum space and to deduce the
incoherent temporal evolution of their population. Here, we show for the
example of CuPc/Cu(001)-2O that the method also gives access to the coherent
regime and that different excitation pathways can be disentangled by a careful
analysis of the time-dependent change of the photoemission momentum pattern. In
particular, we demonstrate by varying photon energy and polarization of the
pump light, how the incoherent temporal evolution of the LUMO distribution can
be distinguished from coherent contributions of the projected HOMO. Moreover,
we report the selective excitation of molecules with a specific orientation at
normal incidence by aligning the electric field of the pump light along the
molecular axis.

<h3>Engineering magnetic domain wall energies in multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ via  epitaxial strain</h3>

<br>
<i>Sebastian Meyer, Bin Xu, Laurent Bellaiche, Bertrand Dupé</i>
<p>Epitaxial strain has emerged as a powerful tool to tune magnetic and
ferroelectric properties in functional materials such as in multiferroic
perovskite oxides. Here, we use first-principles calculations to explore the
evolution of magnetic interactions in the antiferromagnetic multiferroic
BiFeO$_3$ (BFO), one of the most promising multiferroics for future technology.
The epitaxial strain in BFO(001) oriented film is varied between
$\varepsilon_{xx,yy}$ $\in$ $[-2\%, +2\%]$. We find that both strengths of the
exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) decrease
linearly from compressive to tensile strain whereas the uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy follows a parabolic behavior which lifts the
energy degeneracy of the (111) easy plane of bulk BFO. From the trends of the
magnetic interactions we can explain the destruction of cycloidal order in
compressive strain as observed in experiments due to the increasing anisotropy
energy. For tensile strain, we predict that the ground state remains unchanged
as a function of strain. By using the domain wall (DW) energy, we envision the
region where isolated chiral magnetic texture might occur as function of strain
i.e. where the DW and the spin spiral energy are equal. This transition between
$-1.5\%$ and $-0.5\%$ of strain should allow topologically stable magnetic
states such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions and merons to occur. Hence, our work
should trigger experimental and theoretical investigations in this range of
strain.

<h3>Controllable orbital angular momentum monopoles in chiral topological  semimetals</h3>

<p>The emerging field of orbitronics aims at generating and controlling currents
of electronic orbital angular momentum (OAM) for information processing.
Structurally chiral topological crystals could be particularly suitable
orbitronic materials because they have been predicted to host topological band
degeneracies in reciprocal space that are monopoles of OAM. Around such a
monopole, the OAM is locked isotopically parallel or antiparallel to the
direction of the electron's momentum, which could be used to generate large and
controllable OAM currents. However, OAM monopoles have not yet been directly
observed in chiral crystals, and no handle to control their polarity has been
discovered. Here, we use circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy (CD-ARPES) to image OAM monopoles in the chiral topological
semimetals PtGa and PdGa. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the polarity of
the monopole can be controlled via the structural handedness of the host
crystal by imaging OAM monopoles and anti-monopoles in the two enantiomers of
PdGa, respectively. For most photon energies used in our study, we observe a
sign change in the CD-ARPES spectrum when comparing positive and negative
momenta along the light direction near the topological degeneracy. This is
consistent with the conventional view that CD-ARPES measures the projection of
the OAM monopole along the photon momentum. For some photon energies, however,
this sign change disappears, which can be understood from our numerical
simulations as the interference of polar atomic OAM contributions, consistent
with the presence of OAM monopoles. Our results highlight the potential of
chiral crystals for orbitronic device applications, and our methodology could
enable the discovery of even more complicated nodal OAM textures that could be
exploited for orbitronics.

<p>Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is being developed to enable
nanoscale compositional analyses of frozen liquids. Yet, the availability of
readily available substrates that allow for the fixation of liquids while
providing sufficient strength to their interface, is still an issue. Here we
propose the use of 1-2 microns thick binary alloy film of gold-silver (AuAg)
sputtered onto flat silicon, with sufficient adhesion without an additional
layer. Through chemical dealloying, we successfully fabricate a nanoporous
substrate, with open-pore structure, which is mounted on a microarray of Si
posts by lift out in the focused-ion beam, allowing for cryogenic fixation of
liquids. We present cryo-APT results obtained after cryogenic sharpening,
vacuum cryo-transfer and analysis of pure water on top and inside the
nanoporous film. We demonstrate that this new substrate has the requisite
characteristics for facilitating cryo-APT of frozen liquids, with a relatively
lower volume of precious metals. This complete workflow represents an improved
approach for frozen liquid analysis, from preparation of the films to the
successful fixation of the liquid in the porous network, to cryo-atom probe
tomography.

<p>Recent progress on the signatures of pressure-induced high temperature
superconductivity in Ruddlesden Popper (RP) nickelates (Lan+1NinO3n+1) has
attracted growing interest in both theoretical calculations and experimental
efforts. The fabrication of high-quality single crystalline RP nickelate thin
films is critical for possible reducing the superconducting transition pressure
and advancing applications in microelectronics in the future. In this study, we
report the observations of an active phase transition in RP nickelate films
induced by misfit strain. We found that RP nickelate films favor the perovskite
structure (n = infinite) under tensile strains, while compressive strains
stabilize the La3Ni2O7 (n = 2) phase. The selection of distinct phases is
governed by the strain dependent formation energy and electronic configuration.
In compressively strained La3Ni2O7, we experimentally determined splitting
energy is ~0.2 eV and electrons prefer to occupy in-plane orbitals. First
principles calculations unveil a robust coupling between strain effects and the
valence state of Ni ions in RP nickelates, suggesting a dual driving force for
the inevitable phase co-existence transition in RP nickelates. Our work
underscores the sensitivity of RP nickelate formation to epitaxial strain,
presenting a significant challenge in fabricating pure-phase RP nickelate
films. Therefore, special attention to stacking defects and grain boundaries
between different RP phases is essential when discussing the pressure-induced
superconductivity in RP nickelates.

<p>Understanding heating and cooling mechanisms in mesoscopic
superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices is crucial for their application in
quantum technologies. Owing to the poor thermal conductivity of typical
devices, heating effects can drive superconducting-to-normal phase transitions
even at low applied bias, observed as sharp conductance dips through the loss
of Andreev excess currents. Tracking such dips across magnetic field, cryostat
temperature, and applied microwave power, which constitutes Joule spectroscopy,
allows to uncover the underlying cooling bottlenecks in different parts of a
device. By applying this technique, we analyze heat dissipation in devices
based on full-shell InAs-Al nanowires and reveal that superconducting islands
are strongly susceptible to heating as their cooling is limited by the rather
inefficient electron-phonon coupling, as opposed to grounded superconductors
that primarily cool by quasiparticle diffusion. Our measurements indicate that
powers as low as 50-150 pW are able to fully suprpress the superconductivity of
an island. Finally, we show that applied microwaves lead to similar heating
effects as DC signals, and explore the interplay of the microwave frequency and
the effective electron-phonon relaxation time.

<h3>Stability of nanoparticle laden aerosol liquid droplets</h3>

<br>
<i>A. J. Archer, B. D. Goddard, R. Roth</i>
<p>We develop a model for the thermodynamics and evaporation dynamics of aerosol
droplets of a liquid such as water, surrounded by the gas. When the temperature
and the chemical potential (or equivalently the humidity) are such that the
vapour phase is the thermodynamic equilibrium state, then of course droplets of
the pure liquid evaporate over a relatively short time. However, if the
droplets also contain nanoparticles or any other non-volatile solute, then the
droplets can become thermodynamically stable. We show that the equilibrium
droplet size depends strongly on the amount and solubility of the nanoparticles
within, i.e. on the nature of the particle interactions with the liquid, and of
course also on the vapour temperature and chemical potential. We develop a
simple thermodynamic model for such droplets and compare predictions with
results from a lattice density functional theory that takes as input the same
particle interaction properties, finding very good agreement. We also use
dynamical density functional theory to study the evaporation/condensation
dynamics of liquid from/to droplets as they equilibrate with the vapour,
thereby demonstrating droplet stability.

<h3>Effect of Constraint Relaxation on the Minimum Vertex Cover Problem in  Random Graphs</h3>

<br>
<i>Aki Dote, Koji Hukushima</i>
<p>A statistical-mechanical study of the effect of constraint relaxation on the
minimum vertex cover problem in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs is presented.
Using a penalty-method formulation for constraint relaxation, typical
properties of solutions, including infeasible solutions that violate the
constraints, are analyzed by means of the replica method and cavity method. The
problem involves a competition between reducing the number of vertices to be
covered and satisfying the edge constraints. The analysis under the
replica-symmetric (RS) ansatz clarifies that the competition leads to
degeneracies in the vertex and edge states, which determine the quantitative
properties of the system, such as the cover and penalty ratios. A precise
analysis of these effects improves the accuracy of RS approximation for the
minimum cover ratio in the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) region. Furthermore,
the analysis based on the RS cavity method indicates that the RS/RSB boundary
of the ground states with respect to the mean degree of the graphs is expanded,
and the critical temperature is lowered by constraint relaxation.

<br>
<i>Ricardo Gutiérrez, Rodolfo Cuerno</i>
<p>The space-time process whereby one-dimensional systems of self-sustained
oscillators synchronize is shown to display generic scale invariance, with
scaling properties characteristic of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with
columnar noise, and phase fluctuations that follow a Tracy-Widom probability
distribution. This is revealed by a numerical exploration of rings of
Stuart-Landau oscillators (the universal representation of an oscillating
system close to a Hopf bifurcation) and rings of van der Pol oscillators, both
of which are paradigms of self-sustained oscillators. The critical behavior is
very well-defined for limit-cycle oscillations near the bifurcation point, and
still dominates the behavior comparatively far from the bifurcation. In
particular, the Tracy-Widom fluctuation distribution seems to be an extremely
robust feature of the synchronization process. The nonequilibrium criticality
here described appears to transcend the details of the coupled dynamical
systems that synchronize, making plausible its experimental observation.

<p>Carbon fiber reinforced polymers are widely used due to their lightweight and
strong structural properties and understanding their mechanical behavior is
crucial for their reliable use in structural components. In this study, we
evaluated the mechanical properties of a carbon fiber reinforced composite made
of a dynamic polymer based on benzoxazine and polyetheramine Jeffamine(R) ED
600. Standard compression tests were performed on specimens with layers
oriented longitudinally or transversely to the loading direction. In-situ
mechanical testing using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging was
conducted to capture detailed images of the internal microstructure during
deformation. Changes in porosity and pore shape were observed as the composite
underwent compression. Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) analysis was applied to
quantify displacements and strains within the material and enabled the
visualization and quantification of strain patterns, which agree with kinking
failure.

<h3>Spontaneous polarization in NaNbO$_{3}$ film on NdGaO$_{3}$ and  DyScO$_{3}$ substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13266</a>
<br>
<i>Kisung Kang, Saud Bin Anooz, Jutta Schwarzkopf, Christian Carbogno</i>
<p>Pure NaNbO$_{3}$ is an antiferroelectric material at room temperature that
irreversibly transforms to a ferroelectric polar state when subjected to an
external electrical field or lattice strain. Experimentally, it has been
observed that NaNbO$_{3}$ films grown on NdGaO$_{3}$ exhibit an electrical
polarization along the [001]$_{\mathrm{PC}}$ direction, whereas films on
DyScO$_{3}$ substrates exhibit a polarization along the [011]$_{\mathrm{PC}}$
direction. These effects have been attributed to the realization of different
lattice symmetries in the films due to the incorporation of lattice strain
imposed by the use of oxide substrates with different lattice parameters.
However, the underlying atomistic mechanisms of the resulting phase symmetry in
the films are hardly clear, given that NaNbO$_{3}$ features a diverse and
complex phase diagram. In turn, these also impede a straightforward tailoring
and optimization of the resulting macroscopic properties on different
substrates. To clarify this issue, we perform all-electron first-principles
calculations for several potential NaNbO$_{3}$ polymorphs under stress and
strain. The computed properties, including the ferroelectric polarization,
reveal that an orthorhombic $Pmc2_{1}$ phase is realized on NdGaO$_{3}$
substrates since this is the only phase with an out-of-plane polarization under
a compressive strain. Conversely, the monoclinic $Pm$ phase is consistent for
the samples grown on DyScO$_{3}$ substrate, since this phase exhibits a
spontaneous in-plane polarization along [011]$_{\mathrm{PC}}$ under tensile
strain.

<h3>Colloidal diffusiophoresis in crossed electrolyte gradients:  experimental demonstration of an 'action at a distance' effect predicted by  the Nernst-Planck equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13287" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13287</a>
<br>
<i>Ian Williams, Patrick B. Warren, Richard P. Sear, Joseph L. Keddie</i>
<p>In an externally imposed electrolyte (salt) concentration gradient, charged
colloids drift at speeds of order one micrometre per second. This phenomenon is
known as diffusiophoresis. In systems with multiple salts and 'crossed' salt
gradients, a nonlocal component of the electric field associated with a
circulating (solenoidal) ion current can arise. This is in addition to the
conventional local component that depends only on the local salt gradients.
Here we report experimental observations verifying the existence of this
nonlocal contribution. To our knowledge this is the first observation of
nonlocal diffusiophoresis. The current develops quasi-instantaneously on the
time scale of salt diffusion. Therefore, in systems with multiple salts and
crossed salt gradients, one can expect a nonlocal contribution to
diffusiophoresis which is dependent on the geometry of the system as a whole
and appears as a kind of instantaneous 'action-at-a-distance' effect. The
interpretation is aided by a magnetostatic analogy. Our experiments are
facilitated by a judicious particle-dependent choice of salt (potassium
acetate) for which the two local contributions to diffusiophoresis almost
cancel, effectively eliminating conventional diffusiophoresis. This enables us
to clearly identify the novel, nonlocal effect and may be useful in other
contexts, for example in sorting particle mixtures.

<i>Tianyi Wu, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha</i>
<p>We consider a driven-dissipative system consisting of an atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates loaded into a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice and coupled to a
single mode of an optical cavity. Due to the interplay between strong,
repulsive atomic interaction and the atom-cavity coupling, the system exhibits
several phases of atoms and photons including the atomic superfluid (SF) and
supersolid (SS). We investigate the dynamical behaviour of the system, where we
include dissipation by means of Lindblad master equation formalism. Due to the
discontinuous nature of the Dicke transition for strong atomic repulsion, we
find extended co-existence region of different phases. We investigate the
resulting switching dynamics, particularly between the coexisting SF and SS
phases, which eventually becomes damped by the dissipation.

<p>We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of a
novel ternary compound, Th$_2$Cu$_4$As$_5$. The material crystallizes in a
tetragonal structure with lattice parameters $a=4.0716(1)$ {\AA} and
$c=24.8131(4)$ {\AA}. Its structure can be described as an alternating stacking
of fluorite-type Th$_2$As$_2$ layers with antifluorite-type double-layered
Cu$_4$As$_3$ slabs. The measurement of electrical resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat reveals that Th$_2$Cu$_4$As$_5$ undergoes bulk
superconducting transition at 4.2 K. Moreover, all these physical quantities
exhibit anomalies at 48 K, where the Hall coefficient change the sign. These
findings suggest a charge-density-wave-like (CDW) transition, making
Th$_2$Cu$_4$As$_5$ a rare example for studying the interplay between CDW and
superconductivity.

<p>Strong light fields have created spectacular opportunities to tailor novel
functionalities of solids. Floquet-Bloch states can form under periodic driving
of electrons and enable exotic quantum phases. On subcycle time scales,
lightwaves can simultaneously drive intraband currents and interband
transitions, which enable high-harmonic generation (HHG) and pave the way
towards ultrafast electronics. Yet, the interplay of intra- and interband
excitations as well as their relation with Floquet physics have been key open
questions as dynamical aspects of Floquet states have remained elusive. Here we
provide this pivotal link by pioneering the ultrafast buildup of Floquet-Bloch
bands with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We drive
surface states on a topological insulator with mid-infrared fields - strong
enough for HHG - and directly monitor the transient band structure with
subcycle time resolution. Starting with strong intraband currents, we observe
how Floquet sidebands emerge within a single optical cycle; intraband
acceleration simultaneously proceeds in multiple sidebands until high-energy
electrons scatter into bulk states and dissipation destroys the Floquet bands.
Quantum nonequilibrium calculations explain the simultaneous occurrence of
Floquet states with intra- and interband dynamics. Our joint experiment-theory
study opens up a direct time-domain view of Floquet physics and explores the
fundamental frontiers of ultrafast band-structure engineering.

<h3>Liquid-solid friction on crystalline surfaces: a perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13311</a>
<br>
<i>Mathieu Lizée, Alessandro Siria</i>
<p>Liquids flowing on solid surfaces experience a friction force. Whereas solid
friction is familiar to anyone gifted with the sense of touch, liquid friction
is much more exotic. Although it was long believed to be infinite, meaning that
interfacial liquid molecules stick to solid surfaces, we have known for a few
decades that this is not the case and that some materials show extreme liquid
slippage, which implies a dramatic enhancement of nanoscale pipes' permeability
to liquid flows. Harnessing liquid friction bears the promise of
high-efficiency membrane separation processes, heat recovery systems, or blue
energy harvesting, turning it into a highly strategic field to reduce carbon
emissions and meet the climate emergency.

<p>REFeAsO (RE1111; RE: rare earth) belongs to the 1111 family of iron-based
superconductors (FBS), which illustrates the enhancement of the superconducting
transition (Tc) with smaller radii of RE. However, the synthesis of the 1111
phase with a heavy rare-earth is always challenging. In this paper, we report
the optimization of the growth and superconducting properties of F-doped
GdFeAsO1-xFx bulks by preparing the samples in a wide temperature range
(700-1100{\deg}C) at ambient pressure. The optimized synthesis parameters are
concluded based on structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic
measurements. These findings suggest that the optimal conditions for preparing
F-doped Gd1111 bulks involve a two-step process at 900{\deg}C for 61 hours at
ambient pressure, which is lower than previously reported. The optimized
samples have revealed the superconducting transition temperature (Tconset) of
43 K for GdFeAsO0.83F0.17. The first-time reported critical current Jc value
for this Gd1111 is observed of the order of 10^3 (A/cm^2) at 0 T and 5 K. Our
investigation also concluded that highly pure precursors, particularly
gadolinium metal, are required to achieve the superconducting properties of
F-doped Gd1111. A high growth pressure of 1 GPa reduces the superconducting
properties of F-doped Gd1111.

<h3>MagGen: A graph aided deep generative model for inverse design of  stable, permanent magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13328</a>
<br>
<i>Sourav Mal, Gaurav Seal, Prasenjit Sen</i>
<p>A significant development towards inverse design of materials with
well-defined target properties is reported. A deep generative model based on
variational autoencoder (VAE), conditioned simultaneously by two target
properties, is developed to inverse design stable magnetic materials. Structure
of the physics informed, property embedded latent space of the model is
analyzed using graph theory, based on the idea of similarity index. The graph
idea is shown to be useful for generating new materials that are likely to
satisfy target properties. An impressive ~96% of the generated materials is
found to satisfy the target properties as per predictions from the target
learning branches. This is a huge improvement over approaches that do not
condition the VAE latent space by target properties, or do not consider
connectivity of the parent materials perturbing which the new materials are
generated. In such models, the fraction of materials satisfying targets can be
as low as ~5%. This impressive feat is achieved using a simple real-space only
representation called Invertible Real-space Crystallographic Representation
(IRCR), that can be directly read from material cif files. Model predictions
are finally validated by performing DFT calculations on a randomly chosen
subset of materials. Performance of the present model using IRCR is comparable
or superior to that of the models reported earlier. This model for magnetic
material generation, MagGen, is applied to the problem of designing rare earth
free permanent magnets with promising results.

<h3>Many-body physics-induced selection rules: application to Raman  spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<i>Igor Benek-Lins, Saurabh Maiti</i>
<p>Spectroscopic measurements in quantum systems are subject to selection rules,
usually based on space-time symmetries, that allow or disallow transitions
between states. In many-body systems, in addition to the single-particle
states, there emerge new ones due to collective excitations of the system. Here
we demonstrate the existence of a "fragile" selection rule that emerges as a
manifestation of many-body effects and outlines the conditions for collective
excitations to couple to a given spectroscopic probe beyond the usual symmetry
considerations. As an example, we apply the rule to Raman spectroscopy of
multiband superconductors and settle some unresolved features in experiments.

<h3>Rashba-splitting-induced topological flat band detected by anomalous  resistance oscillations beyond the quantum limit in ZrTe$_5$</h3>

<br>
<i>Dong Xing, Bingbing Tong, Senyang Pan, Zezhi Wang, Jianlin Luo, Jinglei Zhang, Cheng-Long Zhang</i>
<p>Topological flat band, on which the kinetic energy of topological electrons
is quenched, represents a platform for investigating the topological properties
of correlated systems. Recent experimental studies on flattened electronic
bands have mainly concentrated on 2-dimensional materials created by van der
Waals heterostructure-based engineering. Here, we report the observation of a
topological flat band formed by polar-distortion-assisted Rashba splitting in a
3-dimensional Dirac material ZrTe$_5$. The polar distortion and resulting
Rashba splitting on the band are directly detected by torque magnetometry and
the anomalous Hall effect, respectively. The local symmetry breaking further
flattens the band, on which we observe resistance oscillations beyond the
quantum limit. These oscillations follow the temperature dependence of the
Lifshitz-Kosevich formula but are evenly distributed in B instead of 1/B in
high magnetic fields. Furthermore, the cyclotron mass anomalously gets enhanced
about 10$^2$ times at field ~20 T. These anomalous properties of oscillations
originate from a topological flat band with quenched kinetic energy. The
topological flat band, realized by polar-distortion-assisted Rashba splitting
in the 3-dimensional Dirac system ZrTe$_5$, signifies an intrinsic platform
without invoking moir\'e or order-stacking engineering, and also opens the door
for studying topologically correlated phenomena beyond the dimensionality of
two.

<p>Heat exchangers are made of metals because of their high heat conductivity
and mechanical stability. Metal surfaces are inherently hydrophilic, leading to
inefficient filmwise condensation. It is still a challenge to coat these metal
surfaces with a durable, robust and thin hydrophobic layer, which is required
for efficient dropwise condensation. Here, we report the non-structured and
ultrathin (~6 nm) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes on copper that sustain
high-performing dropwise condensation in high supersaturation. Due to the
flexible hydrophobic siloxane polymer chains, the coating has low resistance to
drop sliding and excellent chemical stability. The PDMS brushes can sustain
dropwise condensation for up to ~8 h during exposure to 111 {\deg}C saturated
steam flowing at 3 m/s, with a 5-7 times higher heat transfer coefficient
compared to filmwise condensation. The surface is self-cleaning and can reduce
bacterial attachment by 99%. This low-cost, facile, fluorine-free, and scalable
method is suitable for a great variety of condensation heat transfer
applications.

<p>Using a combination of quantum Monte Carlo simulations in adapted cluster
bases, the finite temperature Lanczos method, and an effective Hamiltonian
approach, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnet on the star lattice. We consider various parameter regimes on
this strongly frustrated Archimedean lattice, including the case of homogeneous
couplings as well as the distinct parameter regimes of dominant vs. weak dimer
coupling. For the latter case, we explore the quantum phase diagram in the
presence of inhomogeneous trimer couplings, preserving inversion symmetry. We
compare the efficiency of different cluster decoupling schemes for the quantum
Monte Carlo simulations in terms of the sign problem, contrast the
thermodynamic properties to those of other strongly frustrated quantum magnets,
such as the kagome lattice model, and comment on previous results from
tensor-network calculations regarding a valence bond crystal phase in the
regime of weak dimer coupling. Finally, we relate our results to recently
reported experimental findings on a Cu-based quantum magnetic spin-1/2 compound
with an underlying star lattice structure.

<br>
<i>Zhenyu Cheng, Ying Li, Hantao Lu, Xiang Hu, Zhongbing Huang, Gregory A. Fiete, Liang Du</i>
<p>Doublon-holon dynamics is investigated in a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard
model with a staggered on?site Coulomb interaction at half-filling. When the
system parameters are set to be in the Mott insulating regime the equilibrium
sublattice density of states exhibits several characteristic peaks,
corresponding to the lower and upper Hubbard bands as well as hybridization
bands. We study the linear absorption spectrum and find two main peaks
characterizing the photon frequencies which excite the ground state to an
excited state. For a system driven by a laser pulse with general intensity and
frequency, both the energy absorption and the doublon-holon dynamics exhibit
distinct behaviors as a function of laser amplitude and frequency.
Single-photon processes are observed at low laser intensity where the energy is
absorbed for resonance laser frequencies. For strong laser intensity
multi-photon induced dynamics are observed in the system, which are confirmed
by an evaluation of the Loschmidt amplitude. The contribution of multi-photon
processes to site-specific double occupancy is also characterized by the
generalized Loschmidt amplitude. The site-selective doublon-holon dynamics are
observed in both the one and multi-photon processes and the site-selective
behavior is explained within a quasiparticle picture. Our study suggests
strategies to optically engineer the doublon-holon dynamics in one dimensional
strongly correlated many-body systems.

<p>The fascinating realm of strain engineering and wetting transitions in
two-dimensional (2D) materials takes place when placed on a two-dimensional
array of nanopillars or one-dimensional rectangular grated substrates. Our
investigation encompasses a diverse set of atomically thin 2D materials,
including transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, and
graphene, with a keen focus on the impact of van der Waals adhesion energies to
the substrate on the wetting/dewetting behavior on nanopatterned substrates. We
find a critical aspect ratio of the nanopillar or grating heights to the period
of the pattern when the wetting/dewetting transition occurs. Furthermore,
energy hysteresis analysis reveals dynamic detachment and re-engagement events
during height adjustments, shedding light on energy barriers of 2D monolayer
transferred on patterned substrates. Our findings offer avenues for strain
engineering in 2D materials, leading to promising prospects for future
technological applications.

<p>The spin-to-charge current interconversion in bilayers composed of
ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers with strong spin-orbit coupling has
garnered considerable attention due to its exceptional potential in advancing
spintronics devices for data storage and logic applications. Platinum (Pt)
stands out as one of the most effective materials for generating spin current.
While the spin conversion efficiency is isotropic in polycrystalline Pt
samples, an ongoing debate persists regarding its dependence on the crystalline
direction in single crystalline samples. In this study, we aim to
comprehensively evaluate the in-plane anisotropy of spin-charge interconversion
using an array of complementary Spin Hall and inverse Spin Hall techniques with
both incoherent and coherent excitation. Specifically, we investigate the
spin-to-charge interconversion in epitaxial, (111)-oriented, Co/Pt bilayers
with low surface roughness, as resulted from x-ray experiments. By varying the
thickness of the Pt layer, we gain insights into the spin-charge
interconversion in epitaxial Pt and highlight the effects of the interfaces.
Our results demonstrate an isotropic behavior within the limits of our
detection uncertainty. This finding significantly enhances our understanding of
spin conversion in one of the most relevant systems in spintronics and paves
the way for future research in this field.

<p>Superposed symmetry-equivalent magnetic ordering wave vectors can lead to
topologically non-trivial spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions and
hedgehogs, and give rise to novel quantum phenomena due to fictitious magnetic
fields associated with a non-zero Berry curvature of these spin textures. To
date, all known spin textures are constructed through the superposition of
multiple spiral orders, where spins vary in directions with constant amplitude.
Recent theoretical studies have suggested that multiple sinusoidal orders,
where collinear spins vary in amplitude, can construct distinct topological
spin textures regarding chirality properties. However, such textures have yet
to be experimentally realised. In this work, we report the observation of a
zero-field magnetic hedgehog lattice from a superposition of triple sinusoidal
wave vectors in the magnetically frustrated Kondo lattice CePtAl4Ge2. Notably,
we also observe the emergence of anomalous electrical and thermodynamic
behaviours near the field-induced transition from the zero-field topological
hedgehog lattice to a non-topological sinusoidal state. These observations
highlight the role of Kondo coupling in stabilising the zero-field hedgehog
state in the Kondo lattice and warrant an expedited search for other
topological magnetic structures coupled with Kondo coupling.

<i>Ehsan Ghane, Martin Fagerström, Mohsen Mirkhalaf</i>
<p>As a surrogate for computationally intensive meso-scale simulation of woven
composites, this article presents Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models.
Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the initialization challenges and
sparse data issues inherent in cyclic shear strain loads are addressed in the
RNN models. A mean-field model generates a comprehensive data set representing
elasto-plastic behavior. In simulations, arbitrary six-dimensional strain
histories are used to predict stresses under random walking as the source task
and cyclic loading conditions as the target task. Incorporating sub-scale
properties enhances RNN versatility. In order to achieve accurate predictions,
the model uses a grid search method to tune network architecture and
hyper-parameter configurations. The results of this study demonstrate that
transfer learning can be used to effectively adapt the RNN to varying strain
conditions, which establishes its potential as a useful tool for modeling
path-dependent responses in woven composites.

<h3>Luther-Emery liquid and dominant singlet superconductivity in the  two-orbital Hubbard chain</h3>

<br>
<i>Pontus Laurell, Jacek Herbrych, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<p>We investigate the pairing tendencies in the two-orbital Hubbard chain at
intermediate repulsive interaction strengths $U$, and for degenerate orbitals.
At half-filling and large $U$, the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling,
$J_\mathrm{H}$, generates effective spin-$1$ moments, with antiferromagnetic
correlations between sites. Thus the system can be viewed as an electronic
generalization of Haldane's spin-$1$ chain in that limit. Using large-scale
density matrix renormalization group calculations, we study the system's
behavior under light hole-doping. For $U=1.6$ in units of the non-interacting
bandwidth and $J_\mathrm{H}/U\gtrsim 0.275$ we find that singlet pairing
dominates the long-distance physics, establishing this system as a promising
platform for repulsively mediated superconductivity. We provide evidence that
the system approaches a Luther-Emery liquid state at large system sizes,
similarly to the behavior of doped one-orbital two-leg ladders at weak
coupling. The numerically calculated central charge approaches one in the
thermodynamic limit, indicating a single gapless mode as is expected for the
Luther-Emery state. Exponents characterizing the power-law decays of singlet
pair-pair and charge density-density correlations are determined, and found to
approximately satisfy the Luther-Emery identity. Candidate materials to realize
this physics are discussed.

<p>We report on a lightwave-driven scanning tunneling microscope based on a
home-built microscope and a compact, commercial, and cost-effective
terahertz-generation unit with a repetition rate of 100 MHz. The measurements
are performed in ultrahigh vacuum at temperatures between 10 K and 300 K. The
cross-correlation of the pump and probe pulses indicate a temporal resolution
on the order of a picosecond. In terms of spatial resolution, CO molecules,
step edges and atomically resolved terraces are readily observed in terahertz
images, with sometimes better contrast than in the topographic and (DC) current
channels. The utilization of a compact, turn-key terahertz-generation system
requires only limited experience with optics and terahertz generation, which
may facilitate the deployment of the technique to further research groups.

<p>Our understanding of quantum materials is commonly based on precise
determinations of their electronic spectrum by spectroscopic means, most
notably angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM). Both require atomically clean and flat crystal
surfaces which traditionally are prepared by in-situ mechanical cleaving in
ultrahigh vacuum chambers. We present a new approach that addresses three main
issues of the current state-of-the-art methods: 1) Cleaving is a highly
stochastic and thus inefficient process; 2) Fracture processes are governed by
the bonds in a bulk crystal, and many materials and surfaces simply do not
cleave; 3) The location of the cleave is random, preventing data collection at
specified regions of interest. Our new workflow is based on Focused Ion Beam
(FIB) machining of micro-stress lenses in which shape (rather than crystalline)
anisotropy dictates the plane of cleavage, which can be placed at a specific
target layer. As proof-of-principle we show ARPES results from micro-cleaves of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ along the ac plane and from two surface orientations of
SrTiO$_3$, a notoriously difficult to cleave cubic perovskite.

<p>The barrier crossing event for superdiffusion in the form of symmetric
L\'{e}vy flights is investigated. We derive from the fractional Fokker-Planck
equation a general differential equation with the corresponding conditions
useful to calculate the mean residence time of a particle in a fixed interval
for an arbitrary smooth potential profile, in particular metastable, with a
sink and a L\'{e}vy noise with an arbitrary index $\alpha$. A closed expression
in quadrature of the nonlinear relaxation time for L\'{e}vy flights with the
index $\alpha =1$ in cubic metastable potential is obtained. Enhancement of the
mean residence time in the metastable state, analytically derived, due to
L\'{e}vy noise is found.

<p>Ion dynamics that drive the transport and thermophysical properties of molten
salts are poorly understood due to challenges in precisely quantifying the
spatial and temporal fluctuations of specific ions in highly disordered
systems. While the Van Hove correlation function (VHF) obtained from inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) probes these dynamics directly, its interpretation is
limited by the inherent species-averaging of experiments, which obscures
analysis of key ion transport and solvation mechanisms. Here, ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) is used to model the VHF, unravel its partial
contributions, and elucidate its underlying ionic transport mechanisms. Slow
decorrelation is revealed for oppositely charged ions (Mg2+ and Cl-) caused by
ion exchange across the solvation shell between adjoining ionocovalent
complexes. Furthermore, transport coefficients are accurately recovered and
connections between macroscopic properties and ion dynamics are revealed. This
study demonstrates the potential of ab initio-informed VHF to resolve
long-standing challenges in uncovering relationships between picosecond-scale
ion dynamics, mechanisms, and emergent physical properties of molten salts.

<h3>Driven-Dissipative Bose-Einstein Condensation and the Upper Critical  Dimension</h3>

<i>Yikang Zhang, Thomas Barthel</i>
<p>Driving and dissipation can stabilize Bose-Einstein condensates. Using
Keldysh field theory, we analyze this phenomenon for Markovian systems that can
comprise on-site two-particle driving, on-site single-particle and two-particle
loss, as well as edge-correlated pumping. Above the upper critical dimension,
mean-field theory shows that pumping and two-particle driving induce
condensation right at the boundary between the stable and unstable regions of
the non-interacting theory. With nonzero two-particle driving, the condensate
is gapped. This picture is consistent with the recent observation that, without
symmetry constraints beyond invariance under single-particle basis
transformations, all gapped quadratic bosonic Liouvillians belong to the same
phase. For systems below the upper critical dimension, the edge-correlated
pumping penalizes high-momentum fluctuations, rendering the theory
renormalizable. We perform the one-loop renormalization group analysis, finding
a condensation transition inside the unstable region of the non-interacting
theory. Interestingly, its critical behavior is determined by a
Wilson-Fisher-like fixed point with universal correlation-length exponent
$\nu=0.6$ in three dimensions.

<h3>Optical Absorption Effects in Thermal Radiation Barrier Coating  Materials</h3>

<p>Future gas turbine engines will operate at higher gas temperatures and
consequentially hot-section components such as blades, vanes and combustors,
will be subject to higher thermal radiation fluxes than today. Current thermal
barrier coating materials are translucent over the spectral region of the heat
flux so future coatings will also have to provide a barrier to thermal
radiation. The effects of optical absorption and scattering properties of
coating materials on the temperatures and heat fluxes through coatings are
explored using a two-flux heat transfer model, and promising combinations are
identified that reduce the coating-alloy interface temperatures. Lower
interface temperatures occur for thickness normalized absorptions of
$\overline{\kappa} L$ $>$1. The effect of both a narrow and a broad band
spectrally selective absorbing Gd${_2}$Zr${_2}$O$_{7}$ based coating materials
are then studied. These show that large values of the product of the normalized
absorption length and the spectral width of the absorption are required to
significantly decrease the radiative heat transport through a coating. The
results emphasize the importance of enhancing the optical absorption of the
next generation barrier materials as a strategy to increase gas turbine engine
efficiency by decreasing compressor bleed air cooling requirements.
