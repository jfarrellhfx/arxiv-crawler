<h3>Spin drag mechanism of giant thermal magnetoresistance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14455" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14455</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Levchenko, A. V. Andreev</i>
<p>We study hydrodynamic thermal transport in high-mobility two-dimensional
electron systems placed in an in-plane magnetic field, and identify a new
mechanism of thermal magnetotransport. This mechanism is caused by drag between
the electron populations with opposite spin polarization, which arises in the
presence of a hydrodynamic flow of heat. In high mobility systems, spin drag
results in strong thermal magnetoresistance, which becomes of the order of 100%
at relatively small spin polarization of the electron liquid. We express the
thermal magnetoresistance in terms of intrinsic dissipative coefficients of
electron fluid and show that it is primarily determined by the spin diffusion
constant.

<h3>Revealing hidden structures and symmetries in nonequilibrium transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14496</a>
<br>
<i>David Andrieux</i>
<p>Recent results have shown how to partition the parameter space of Markov
systems into dynamical equivalence classes. These equivalence classes structure
transport properties in such a way that makes, among other features, their
responses fully symmetric. In this note, I illustrate this approach on two
representative systems. First, I derive analytical expressions for the
equivalence classes of a disordered ring model. Second, I verify on a model of
ion transport that, within an equivalence class, the response of coupled
currents is symmetric both near and far from equilibrium.

<h3>Topological signatures of a p-wave superconducting wire through light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14501</a>
<br>
<i>Frederick Del Pozo, Karyn Le Hur</i>
<p>We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional
topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical
vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the quasiparticles
inter-band transition rates. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is
possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance
envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range
Kitaev wire. We also propose to probe the topological phase transition in the
model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the
light field and also through the Josephson current between the wire and the
proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on
the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum
electrodynamics.

<h3>Non-zero crossing current-voltage characteristics of interface-type  resistive switching devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14507</a>
<br>
<i>Sahitya Yarragolla, Torben Hemke, Jan Trieschmann, Thomas Mussenbrock</i>
<p>A number of memristive devices, mainly ReRAMs, have been reported to exhibit
a unique non-zero crossing hysteresis attributed to the interplay of resistive
and not yet fully understood `capacitive', and `inductive' effects. This work
exploits a kinetic simulation model based on the stochastic cloud-in-a-cell
method to capture these effects. The model, applied to Au/BiFeO$_{3}$/Pt/Ti
interface-type devices, incorporates vacancy transport and capacitive
contributions. The resulting nonlinear response, characterized by hysteresis,
is analyzed in detail, providing an in-depth physical understanding of the
virtual effects. Capacitive effects are modeled across different layers,
revealing their significant role in shaping the non-zero crossing hysteresis
behavior. Results from kinetic simulations demonstrate the impact of
frequency-dependent impedance on the non-zero crossing phenomenon. This model
provides insights into the effects of various device material properties, such
as Schottky barrier height, device area and oxide layer on the non-zero
crossing point.

<h3>Thermodynamics of vison crystals in an anisotropic quantum spin liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14525</a>
<br>
<i>Ritwika Majumder, Onur Erten, Anamitra Mukherjee</i>
<p>Using unbiased Monte Carlo simulations and variational analysis, we present
the ground state and finite temperature phase diagrams of an exactly solvable
spin-orbital model with Kitaev-type interactions on a square lattice. We show
that an array of new gapped and gapless vison crystals -- characterized by the
periodic arrangement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations -- can be stabilized as
a function of external magnetic field and exchange anisotropy. In particular,
we discover a variety of `quarter phases' wherein new sixteen-site periodic
patterns emerge, with only a quarter of the fluxes adopting 0-flux
configurations. In contrast, the rest remain in $\pi$-flux configurations.
Vison crystals break translational symmetry and undergo finite temperature
phase transitions. We investigate the finite temperature properties of these
phases and report the corresponding critical and crossover temperatures. Our
results reveal an array of novel phases in exactly solvable extensions of the
Kitaev model, wherein local and topological orders can coexist.

<h3>Characterization of individual charge fluctuators in Si/SiGe quantum  dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14541" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14541</a>
<br>
<i>Feiyang Ye, Ammar Ellaboudy, Dylan Albrecht, Rohith Vudatha, N. Tobias Jacobson, John M. Nichol</i>
<p>Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are excellent qubits due to their long
coherence times, scalability, and compatibility with advanced semiconductor
technology. Although high gate fidelities can be achieved with spin qubits,
charge noise in the semiconductor environment still hinders further
improvements. Despite the importance of charge noise, key questions about the
specific nature of the fluctuators that cause charge noise remain unanswered.
Here, we probe individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots
through simple quantum-dot transport measurement and analyses based on the
Allan variance and factorial hidden Markov modeling. We find that the TLF
switching times depend sensitively on gate voltages, decrease with temperature,
and depend on the current through a nearby quantum dot. A model for the data of
the primary TLF we study indicates that it may be a bistable charge dipole near
the plunger gate electrode, heated by current through the sensor dot, and
experiencing state transitions driven not by direct electron-phonon coupling
but through some other mechanism such as coupling to electrons passing through
the sensor dot.

<h3>Honeycomb monolithic design to enhance the performance of Ni-based  catalysts for dry reforming of methane</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14543" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14543</a>
<br>
<i>Fazia Agueniou, Hilario Vidal, M. Pilar Yeste, Juan C. Hernandez-Garrido, Miguel A. Cauqui, Jose M. Rodriguez-Izquierdo, Jose J. Calvino, Jose M. Gatica</i>
<p>Supported Ni catalysts (4,5% wt%) using a Ce-Zr oxide (18/82 molar ratio and
a ceria rich surface) depicting advanced redox properties, were deposited by
washcoating over cordierite honeycombs (230 and 400 cpsi). FIB-STEM unveiled
nanostructure details otherwise undistinguishable by conventional techniques.
The catalytic performance was evaluated in the dry reforming of methane al
700-900 degree C, using a CH4:CO2 1:1 feddstock, and exploring high Weight
Hourly Space Velocity (115-346 L.g-1.h-1). The structured catalyts exhibited
better performance than the corresponding powers, reaching values close to
rhermodynamics limits for booth reactants conversion and H2/CO ratio, from 750
dgree C, and no deactivation was observed in prolongued experiments (24-48 h).
This was related to both the high catalytic efficiency after being deposited
with low loading on the cordierite and the intrinsic advantages of the
monolithic reactor, like preventing from the kinetic control that operates in
powdered samples under high WHSV or limiting the deactivation.

<h3>Discovery of a Topological Charge Density Wave</h3>

Yang, Daniel Multer, Xiaoxiong Liu, Nan Yao, Yugui Yao, Claudia Felser, Titus Neupert, M. Zahid Hasan</i>
<p>Charge density waves (CDWs) appear in numerous condensed matter platforms,
ranging from high-Tc superconductors to quantum Hall systems. Despite such
ubiquity, there has been a lack of direct experimental study on boundary states
that can uniquely stem from the charge order. Here, using scanning tunneling
microscopy, we directly visualize the bulk and boundary phenomenology of CDW in
a topological material, Ta2Se8I. Below the transition temperature (TCDW = 260
K), tunneling spectra on an atomically resolved lattice reveal a large
insulating gap in the bulk and on the surface, exceeding 500 meV, surpassing
predictions from standard weakly-coupled mean-field theory. Spectroscopic
imaging confirms the presence of CDW, with LDOS maxima at the conduction band
corresponding to the LDOS minima at the valence band, thus revealing a {\pi}
phase difference in the respective CDW order. Concomitantly, at a monolayer
step edge, we detect an in-gap boundary mode with modulations along the edge
that match the CDW wavevector along the edge. Intriguingly, the phase of the
edge state modulation shifts by {\pi} within the charge order gap, connecting
the fully gapped bulk (and surface) conduction and valence bands via a smooth
energy-phase relation. This bears similarity to the topological spectral flow
of edge modes, where the boundary modes bridge the gapped bulk modes in energy
and momentum magnitude but in Ta2Se8I, the connectivity distinctly occurs in
energy and momentum phase. Notably, our temperature-dependent measurements
indicate a vanishing of the insulating gap and the in-gap edge state above
TCDW, suggesting their direct relation to CDW. The theoretical analysis also
indicates that the observed boundary mode is topological and linked to CDW.

<h3>Advancing Scanning Probe Microscopy Simulations: A Decade of Development  in Probe-Particle Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14564</a>
<br>
<i>Niko Oinonen, Aliaksandr V. Yakutovich, Aurelio Gallardo, Martin Ondracek, Prokop Hapala, Ondrej Krejci</i>
<p>The probe-particle model is an open-source package designed for simulation of
scanning probe microscopy experiments, employing non-reactive, flexible tip
apices (e.g., carbon monoxide, xenon, or hydrogen molecules) to achieve
sub-molecular resolution. This abstract introduces the latest version of the
probe-particle model, highlighting substantial advancements in accuracy,
computational performance, and user-friendliness over previous versions. To
demonstrate this we provide a comprehensive review of theories for simulating
non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy (nc-AFM), spanning from the simple
Lennard-Jones potential to the latest full density-based model. Implementation
of these theories are systematically compared against ab initio calculated
reference, showcasing their respective merits. All parts of the probe-particle
model have undergone acceleration by 1-2 orders of magnitude through
parallelization by OpenMP on CPU and OpenCL on GPU. The updated package
includes an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) and seamless integration
into the Python ecosystem via pip, facilitating advanced scripting and
interoperability with other software. This adaptability positions the
probe-particle model as an ideal tool for high-throughput applications,
including the training of machine learning models for the automatic recovery of
atomic structures from nc-AFM measurements. We envision significant potential
for this application in future single-molecule analysis, synthesis, and
advancements of surface science in general. Additionally, we discuss
simulations of other sub-molecular scanning-probe imaging techniques, such as
bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and kelvin probe force microscopy,
all built on the robust foundation of the probe-particle model. Altogether this
demonstrates the broad impact of the model across diverse domains of surface
science and molecular chemistry.

<h3>Breakdown of Kubo relation in Pt-Cu nanoparticle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14573" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14573</a>
<br>
<i>Shunsaku Kitagawa, Yudai Kinoshita, Kenji Ishida, Kouhei Kusada, Hiroshi Kitagawa</i>
<p>Nanoparticles were predicted to exhibit unique physical properties due to
quantum size effects, but their identification remains difficult. According to
Kubo's theory, the gap size is inversely correlated with both the density of
states at the Fermi energy and the number of atoms in the particle. Previously,
we confirmed that the particle size and magnetic field dependence of NMR
anomaly temperature is consistent with the estimated "Kubo" gap. Here, we
investigated the density-of-states dependence in the Pt$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$
nanoparticles. While an enhancement of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ at low temperatures was clearly observed for the Pt-rich nanoparticles,
such behavior was abruptly suppressed in the Cu-rich nanoparticles.
Furthermore, the NMR anomaly temperature is nearly unchanged with varying the
density of states. Our findings indicate that the quantum size effect contains
more profound physics than just the ones predicted by Kubo.

<h3>Additively manufactured Ni-20Cr to V functionally graded material:  computational predictions and experimental verification of phase formations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14586" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14586</a>
<br>
<i>Beril Tonyali, Hui Sun, Brandon Bocklund, John Paul Borgonia, Richard A. Otis, Shun-Li Shang, Zi-Kui Liu, Allison M. Beese</i>
<p>A database for the Cr-Ni-V system was constructed by modeling the binary Cr-V
and ternary Cr-Ni-V systems using the CALPHAD approach aided by density
functional theory (DFT)-based first-principles calculations and ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To validate this new database, a
functionally graded material (FGM) using Ni-20Cr and elemental V was fabricated
using directed energy deposition additive manufacturing (DED AM) and
experimentally characterized. The deposited Ni-20Cr was pure fcc phase, while
increasing the amount of V across the gradient resulted in the formation of
sigma phase, followed by the bcc phase. The experimentally measured phase data
was compared with computational predictions made using a Cr-Ni-V thermodynamic
database from the literature as well as the database developed in the present
work. The newly developed database was shown to better predict the
experimentally observed phases due to its accurate modeling of binary systems
within the database and the ternary liquid phase, which is critical for
accurate Scheil calculations.

<h3>Superconducting flux qubit operating at zero magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14597" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14597</a>
<br>
<i>Sunmi Kim, Leonid V. Abdurakhimov, Duong Pham, Wei Qiu, Hirotaka Terai, Sahel Ashhab, Shiro Saito, Taro Yamashita, Kouichi Semba</i>
<p>The operation of a conventional superconducting flux qubit requires the
application of a precisely tuned magnetic field to set the operation point at
half a flux quantum through the qubit loop, which makes the scaling of quantum
circuits based on this type of qubits difficult. It has been proposed that, by
inducing a pi phase shift in the superconducting order parameter using a
precisely controlled nanoscale-thickness
superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction, commonly referred
to as pi-junction, it is possible to realize a flux qubit operating at zero
magnetic flux. We report the realization of a zero-flux-biased flux qubit based
on three NbN/AlN/NbN Josephson junctions and a NbN/PdNi/NbN ferromagnetic
pi-junction. The qubit lifetime is in the microsecond range, which we argue is
limited by quasiparticle excitations in the metallic ferromagnet layer. With
further improvements in the materials of the ferromagnetic junction, the
zero-flux-biased flux qubits can become a promising platform for quantum
computing.

<h3>Spintronic virtual neural network by a voltage controlled ferromagnet  for associative memory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14676" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14676</a>
<br>
<i>Tomohiro Taniguchi, Yusuke Imai</i>
<p>Recently, an associative memory operation by a virtual oscillator network,
consisting of a single spintronic oscillator, was examined to solve issues in
conventional, real oscillators-based neural networks such as inhomogeneities
between the oscillators. However, the spintronic oscillator still carries
issues dissipating large amount of energy because it is driven by electric
current. Here, we propose to use a single ferromagnet manipulated by
voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect as a fundamental element
in a virtual neural network, which will contribute to significantly reducing
the Joule heating caused by electric current. Instead of the oscillation in
oscillator works, magnetization relaxation dynamics were used for the
associative memory operation. The association memory task for alphabet patterns
is successfully demonstrated by giving correspondences between the colors in a
pattern recognition task and the sign of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
coefficient, which could be either positive or negative via the VCMA effect.

<h3>Hidden nonreciprocity as a stabilizing effective potential in active  matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14690" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14690</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew Du, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan</i>
<p>Active matter with nonreciprocal interactions is known for its distinctive
dynamics. To shed light on the stationary properties of such systems, we
consider paradigmatic systems of nonreciprocally coupled active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. For each system, we uniquely decompose the
interparticle force into an energy gradient and a transverse nonconservative
force. We show that the steady-state distribution of positions, which would
only reflect the energy if the noise were thermal, features the transverse
force as an effective potential that stabilizes the energy minima, due to the
persistent noise that propels the particles. We exactly solve the distribution
for nonreciprocal harmonic oscillators and numerically verify the effective
stability for systems with more complex couplings. Our work suggests that
energy injection at the single-particle level controls how, if at all,
nonreciprocity in the interactions appears in stationary states of active
matter.

<h3>Quantum Oscillations Measurement of the Heavy Electron Mass near the van  Hove Singularity in a Kagome Metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14699" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14699</a>
<br>
<i>Elliott Rosenberg, Jonathan DeStefano, Yongbin Lee, Chaowei Hu, Yue Shi, David Graf, Shermane M. Benjamin, Liqin Ke, Jiun-Haw Chu</i>
<p>Kagome metals with the Fermi energy tuned near the van Hove singularities
(vHss) have shown to host exotic phases including unconventional
superconductivity and a chiral flux phase arising from a charge density wave.
However, most quantum oscillations studies of the electronic structure of
kagome metals focus on compounds which electronically or magnetically order,
obscuring the unperturbed vHs. Here we present quantum oscillation measurements
of YV$_6$Sn$_6$ which contains a pristine kagome lattice free from long range
order. We discovered quantum oscillations corresponding to a large orbit
($\approx$70% of the Brillouin Zone area) with the heaviest mass ever observed
in vanadium based kagome metals ($\approx3.3 m_e$), consistent with a Fermi
pocket whose Fermi level is near the vHs. Comparing with first principles
calculations suggests that the effective mass of this pocket is highly
sensitive to the position of Fermi level. Our study establishes the enhanced
density of states associated with a vHs in a kagome metal, allowing further
insight into a potential driving mechanism for the unconventional electronic
orderings in this class of materials.

<h3>Efficient Control of Magnetization Dynamics Via W/CuO$_\text{x}$  Interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14708</a>
<br>
<i>Antarjami Sahoo, Haifeng Ding, Antonio Azevedo, Subhankar Bedanta</i>
<p>Magnetization dynamics, which determine the speed of magnetization switching
and spin information propagation, play a central role in modern spintronics.
Gaining its control will satisfy the different needs of various spintronic
devices. In this work, we demonstrate that the surface oxidized Cu
(CuO$_\text{x}$) can be employed for the tunability of magnetization dynamics
of ferromagnet (FM)/heavy metal (HM) bilayer system. The capping CuO$_\text{x}$
layer in CoFeB/W/CuO$_\text{x}$ trilayer reduces the magnetic damping value in
comparison with the CoFeB/W bilayer. The magnetic damping even becomes lower
than that of the CoFeB/CuO$_\text{x}$ by ~ 16% inferring the stabilization of
anti-damping phenomena. Further, the reduction in damping is accompanied by a
very small reduction in the spin pumping-induced output DC voltage in the
CoFeB/W/CuO$_\text{x}$ trilayer. The simultaneous observation of anti-damping
and spin-to-charge conversion can be attributed to the orbital Rashba effect
observed at the HM/CuO$_\text{x}$ interface. Our experimental findings
illustrate that the cost-effective CuO$_\text{x}$ can be employed as an
integral part of modern spintronics devices owing to its rich underneath
spin-orbital physics.

<h3>Topological Edge and Corner States in Biphenylene Network</h3>

<p>The electronic states and topological properties of the biphenylene network
(BPN) are analyzed using a tight-binding model based on the $\pi$-electron
network. It is shown that tuning the hopping parameters induces topological
phase transitions, leading to the emergence of edge states owing to the
nontrivial topological Zak phase of the bulk BPN. Elementary band analysis
clearly gives the number of edge states, which are associated with the location
of Wannier centers. In addition, we have presented the conditions for the
emergence of corner states owing to the higher-order topological nature of BPN.

<h3>Anomalous electron-phonon coupling in kagome ferromagnetic Weyl  semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</h3>

<i>G. He, M. Kute, Z. C. Xu, L. Peis, R. Stumberger, A. Baum, D. Jost, E. M. Been, B. Moritz, Y. G. Shi, T. P. Devereaux, R. Hackl</i>
<p>We present results of a Raman scattering study of the Kagome ferromagnet
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, with a focus on electronic and phononic excitations and
their interplay. In addition, the electronic band structure is analyzed
theoretically, enabling a semi-quantitative explanation of the spectra. A
prominent feature in the electronic spectra is a redistribution of spectral
weight from low to high energies starting at the Curie temperature Tc. The
Raman intensity is suppressed below approximately 1000cm$^{-1}$ and increases
above to a peak at 2000 cm$^{-1}$ in all symmetries. Two Raman active phonon
modes are identified in A$_{1g}$ and E$_g$ symmetry. The A$_{1g}$ phonon
couples strongly to the electronic continuum as indicated by the asymmetric
Fano-type line shape. The asymmetry depends non-monotonically on temperature
and is maximal close to the magnetic transition. In the limit $T\to 0$ the
phonon is nearly symmetric. The evolution of the coupling strength and the
electronic continuum as a function of temperature is attributed to a band
splitting induced by the ferromagnetic phase transition which substantially
reduces the DOS towards $T=0$. The $3d_{z^2}$ electrons of the Co atoms in the
crystal field modulated by the A$_{1g}$ phonon are implied to be a critical
component contributing to the strong electron-phonon coupling of that phonon.
These results allow a comprehensive understanding of the bulk band structure
evolution as a function of temperature in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, offering key
insights for further studies of the driving force behind the long-range
magnetic order and novel topological states in this compound.

<i>Mingyang Liu, Shizhong Zhang</i>
<p>In this Letter, we discuss the effects of $p$-wave attractive interaction in
a spin-$1/2$ Bose gas. With a repulsive $s$-wave background interaction, we
show that for weak $p$-wave attraction, one obtains a standard Bose-Einstein
condensate at zero momentum with spins fully polarized. Upon increasing the
$p$-wave attraction, a fragmented condensate state with singlet pair formation
and $p$-wave correlation emerges. We determine the transition point and
investigate the properties of the fragmented condensate using an ansatz wave
function. We construct the relevant Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the
fragmented condensate and show that the sound velocities are anisotropic and
may vanish in specific directions. Based on the many-body wave function, we
also discuss the low-energy spin excitations of the system.

<h3>Towards understanding the behavior of polyelectrolyte surfactant  mixtures at the water vapor interface closer to technologically relevant  conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14769</a>
<br>
<i>Sara Llamas, Laura Fernandez-Pena, Andrew Akanno, Eduardo Guzman, Victor Ortega, Francisco Ortega, Aurelio G. Csaky, Richard A. Campbell, Ramon G. Rubio</i>
<p>Polyelectrolyte surfactant mixtures and their interactions with fluid
interfaces are an important research field due to their use in technological
applications. Most of the existing knowledge on these systems is based on
models in which the polyelectrolyte concentration is around 50 times lower than
that used in commercial formulations. The present work marks a step to close
the gap on the understanding of their behavior under more practically relevant
conditions. The adsorption of concentrated mixtures of
poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride and sodium N lauroyl N methyltaurate at
the water-vapor interface with a crude mixing protocol has been studied by
different surface tension techniques, Brewster angle microscopy, neutron
reflectometry, and several bulk characterization techniques. Kinetically
trapped aggregates formed during mixing influence the interfacial morphology of
mixtures produced in the equilibrium one phase region, yet fluctuations in the
surface tension isotherm result depending on the tensiometric technique
applied. At low bulk surfactant concentrations, the free surfactant
concentration is very low, and the interfacial composition matches the trend of
the bulk complexes, which is a behavior that has not been observed in studies
on more dilute mixtures. Nevertheless, a transition to synergistic
co-adsorption of complexes and free surfactant is observed at the higher bulk
surfactant concentrations studied. This transition appears to be a special
feature of these more concentrated mixtures, which deserves attention in future
studies of systems with additional components.

electron microscope (TEM) images, replacing the dependence on local atomic
displacements with atomic positions only. This allows very rapid computation of
simulated TEM images for arbitrarily complex atomistic configurations of
lattice defects and dislocations in the dynamical two beam approximation. Large
scale massively-overlapping cascade simulations performed with molecular
dynamics, are used to generate representative high-dose nanoscale irradiation
damage in tungsten at room temperature, and we compare the simulated TEM images
to experimental TEM images with similar irradiation and imaging conditions. The
simulated TEM shows 'white-dot' damage in weak-beam dark-field imaging
conditions, in line with our experimental observations and as expected from
previous studies, and in bright-field conditions a dislocation network is
observed. In this work we can also compare the images to the nanoscale lattice
defects in the original atomic structures, and find that at high dose the white
spots are not only created by small dislocation loops, but rather arise from
nanoscale fluctuations in strains around curved sections of dislocation lines.

<p>The evolution of dynamic processes in graphene-family materials are of great
interest for both scientific purposes and technical applications. Scanning
electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy outstand among the
techniques that allow both observing and controlling such dynamic processes in
real time. On the other hand, functionalized graphene oxide emerges as a
favorable candidate from graphene-family materials for such an investigation
due to its distinctive properties, that encompass a large surface area, robust
thermal stability, and noteworthy electrical and mechanical properties after
its reduction. Here, we report on studies of surface structure and adsorption
dynamics of L-Cysteine on electrochemically exfoliated graphene oxides basal
plane. We show that electron beam irradiation prompts an amorphization of
functionalized graphene oxide along with the formation of micropatterns of
controlled geometry composed of L-Cysteine-Graphene oxide nanostructures. The
controlled growth and predetermined arrangement of micropatterns as well as
controlled structure disorder induced by e beam amorphization, in its turn
potentially offering tailored properties and functionalities paving the way for
potential applications in nanotechnology, sensor development, and surface
engineering. Our findings demonstrate that graphene oxide can cover L-Cysteine
in such a way to provide a control on the positioning of emerging
microstructures about 10-20 um in diameter. Besides, Raman and SAED measurement
analyses yield above 50% amorphization in a material. The results of our
studies demonstrate that such a technique enables the direct creation of
micropatterns of L-Cysteine-Graphene oxide eliminating the need for complicated
mask patterning procedures.

<i>Shusong Wang, Suying Zhang</i>
<p>Soliton sheets which are formed by interference of Bose Einstein condensates
occupying different single-particle states are observed in optical lattice
potential. This structure consists of one-dimensional stationary solitons
arranged periodically along the peaks of optical lattice (y direction) with the
phase difference between the two sides of the soliton sheets is a linear
function of y in each period, so we call it soliton sheet. A y component
velocity difference exists between the two sides of the soliton sheet. Similar
velocity distributions can be produced by the alignment of an infinite number
of isotropic vortices along the peaks of the optical lattice. Their difference
is that the soliton sheet structure is not limited by the number of phase
singularities and can be generated even without phase singularities.

<h3>Exciting the Higgs mode in a strongly-interacting Fermi gas by  interaction modulation</h3>

<i>Andreas Kell, Moritz Breyer, Daniel Eberz, Michael Köhl</i>
<p>We study the Higgs mode of a strongly-interacting Fermi gas in the crossover
regime between a fermionic and bosonic superfluid. By periodically modulating
the interaction strength of the gas, we parametrically excite the Higgs mode
and study its resonance frequency and line width as a function of both
interaction strength and temperature. We find that the resonance frequency at
low temperature agrees with a local-density approximation of the pairing gap.
Both frequency and line width do not exhibit a pronounced variation with
temperature, which is theoretically unexpected, however, in qualitative
agreement with a different recent study.

<p>The critical behavior of a dimer model with an interaction favoring parallel
dimers in each plaquette of the square lattice is studied numerically by means
of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. The critical
exponents are known to depend on the chemical potential of vacancies, or
monomers. At large average density of the latter, the phase transition becomes
of first-order. We compute the scaling dimensions of both order parameter and
temperature in the second order regime and compare them with the conjecture
that the critical behavior is the same as the Ashkin-Teller model on its
self-dual critical line.

<br>
<i>Alejandro Almodóvar, Tobias Galla, Cristóbal López</i>
<p>A binary mixture of two-different-sizes proliferating motile disks is
studied. As growth is space-limited, we focus on the conditions such that there
is coexistence of both large and small disks, or dominance of the larger disks.
The study involves systematically varying some system parameters, such as
diffusivities, growth rates, and self-propulsion velocities. In particular, we
demonstrate that diffusing faster confers a competitive advantage, so that
larger disks can in the long time coexist or even dominate to the smaller ones.
In the case of self-propelled disks a coexistence regime is induced by the
activity where the two types of disks show the same spatial distribution: both
phase separated or both homogenously distributed in the whole system.

<i>Andriy Goychuk, Deepti Kannan, Mehran Kardar</i>
<p>We consider inhomogeneous polymers driven by energy-consuming active
processes which encode temporal patterns of athermal kicks. We find that such
temporal excitation programs, propagated by tension along the polymer, can
effectively couple distinct polymer loci. Consequently, distant loci exhibit
correlated motions that fold the polymer into specific conformations, as set by
the local actions of the active processes and their distribution along the
polymer. Interestingly, active kicks that are canceled out by a time-delayed
echo can induce strong compaction of the active polymer.

<p>The polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) described by polynomial
rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems
and used in diverse applications in crystalline states. In this study, we
systematically investigate the predictive power of the polynomial MLPs for
liquid structural properties in 22 elemental systems with diverse chemical
bonding properties, including those showing anomalous melting behavior, such as
Si, Ge, and Bi. We compare liquid structural properties obtained from molecular
dynamics simulations using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the
polynomial MLPs, and other interatomic potentials in the literature. The
current results demonstrate that the polynomial MLPs consistently exhibit high
predictive power for liquid structural properties with the same accuracy as
that of typical DFT calculations.

<i>Laura Fernandez-Pena, Eduardo Guzman, Fabien Leonforte, Ana Serrano-Pueyo, Krzysztof Regulski, Lucie Tournier-Couturier, Francisco Ortega, Ramon G. Rubio, Gustavo S. Luengo</i>
<p>Pseudo-binary mixtures of different glycolipids, four different rhamnolipids
(RL) and an alkyl polyglucoside (APG), with poly(diallyl-dimethylammonium
chloride) (PDADMAC) have been studied in relation to their adsorption onto
negatively charged surfaces to shed light on the impact of the molecular
structure of biodegradable surfactants from natural sources (instead of
synthetic surfactant, such as sodium laureth sulfate) on the adsorption of
hair-care formulations. For this purpose, the self-assembly of such mixtures in
aqueous solution and their adsorption onto negatively charged surfaces
mimicking the negative charge of damaged hair fibres have been studied using
experiments and self-consistent field (SCF) calculations. The results show that
the specific physico-chemical properties of the surfactants (charge, number of
sugar rings present in surfactant structure and length of the hydrocarbon
length) play a main role in the control of the adsorption process, with the
adsorption efficiency and hydration being improved in relation to conventional
sulfate-based systems for mixtures of PDADMAC and glycolipids with the shortest
alkyl chains. SCF calculations and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS)
analysis on real hair confirmed such observations. The results allow one to
assume that the characteristic of the studied surfactants, especially
rhamnolipids, conditions positively the adsorption potential of
polyelectrolytes in our model systems. This study provides important insights
on the mechanisms underlying the performance of more complex but natural and
eco-friendly washing formulations.

<h3>Higher-order topology in Fibonacci quasicrystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Chaozhi Ouyang, Qinghua He, Dong-Hui Xu, Feng Liu</i>
<p>In crystalline systems, higher-order topology, characterized by topological
states of codimension greater than one, typically arises from the mismatch
between Wannier centers and atomic sites, leading to filling anomalies.
However, this phenomenon is less understood in aperiodic systems, such as
quasicrystals, where Wannier centers are not well defined. In this study, we
examine Fibonacci chains and squares, a quintessential type of quasicrystal, to
investigate their higher-order topological properties. We discover that
topological interfacial states, including corner states, can be inherited from
their higher-dimensional periodic counterparts, such as the two-dimensional
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. This finding is validated through numerical
simulations of both phononic and photonic Fibonacci quasicrystals by the finite
element method, revealing the emergence of topological edge and corner states
at interfaces between Fibonacci quasicrystals with differing topologies
inherited from their parent systems. Our results not only provide insight into
the higher-order topology of quasicrystals but also open avenues for exploring
novel topological phases in aperiodic structures.

<p>Fluidic iontronics is emerging as a distinctive platform for implementing
neuromorphic circuits, characterized by its reliance on the same aqueous medium
and ionic signal carriers as the brain. Drawing upon recent theoretical
advancements in both iontronic spiking circuits and in dynamic transport of
aqueous electrolytes through conical ion channels, which form fluidic
memristors, we expand the repertoire of proposed neuronal spiking dynamics in
iontronic circuits. Through a modelled circuit containing channels that carry a
bipolar surface charge, we extract phasic bursting, mixed-mode spiking, tonic
bursting, and threshold variability, all with spike voltages and frequencies
within the typical range for mammalian neurons. These features are possible due
to the strong dependence of the typical conductance memory retention time on
the channel length, enabling timescales varying from individual spikes to
bursts of multiple spikes within a single circuit. These advanced forms of
neuronal-like spiking support the exploration of aqueous iontronics as an
interesting platform for neuromorphic circuits.

<p>Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we experimentally and
theoretically investigate isolated platinum phthalocyanine (PtPc) molecules
adsorbed on atomically thin NaCl(100) vapor deposited on Au(111). We obtain
good agreement between theory and constant-height STM topography. We examine
why strong distortions of STM images occur as a function of distance between
molecule and STM tip. The images of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) exhibit, for
increasing distance, significant radial expansion due to electron propagation
in the vacuum. Additionally, the imaged angular dependence is substantially
distorted. The LUMO image has substantial intensity along the molecular
diagonals where PtPc has no atoms. In the electronic transport gap the image
differs drastically from HOMO and LUMO, even at energies very close to these
orbitals. As the tunneling becomes increasingly off-resonant, the eight angular
lobes of the HOMO or of the degenerate LUMOs diminish and reveal four lobes
with maxima along the molecular axes, where both, HOMO and LUMO have little or
no weight. These images are strongly influenced by low-lying PtPc orbitals that
have simple angular structures.

<h3>Straight versus Spongy -- Effect of Tortuosity on Polymer Imbibition  into Nanoporous Matrices Assessed by Segmentation-Free Analysis of 3D Sample  Reconstructions</h3>

<p>We comparatively analyzed imbibition of polystyrene (PS) into two
complementary pore models having pore diameters of about 380 nm and
hydroxyl-terminated inorganic-oxidic pore walls, controlled porous glass (CPG)
and self-ordered porous alumina (AAO), by X-ray computed tomography and EDX
spectroscopy. CPG contains continuous spongy-tortuous pore systems. AAO
containing arrays of isolated straight cylindrical pores is a reference pore
model with a tortuosity close to 1. Comparative evaluation of the
spatiotemporal imbibition front evolution yields important information on the
pore morphology of a probed tortuous matrix like CPG and on the imbibition
mechanism. To this end, pixel brightness dispersions in tomographic 3D
reconstructions and 2D EDX maps of infiltrated AAO and CPG samples were
condensed into 1D brightness dispersion profiles normal to the membrane
surfaces. Their statistical analysis yielded positions and widths of the
imbibition fronts without segmentation or determination of pore positions. The
retardation of the imbibition front movement with respect to AAO reference
samples may be used as a descriptor for the tortuosity of a tested porous
matrix. The velocity of the imbibition front movements in CPG equaled
two-thirds of the velocity of the imbibition front movements in AAO. Moreover,
the dynamics of the imbibition front broadening discloses whether porous
matrices are dominated by cylindrical neck-like pore segments or by nodes.
Independent single-meniscus movements in cylindrical AAO pores result in faster
imbibition front broadening than in CPG, in which a morphology dominated by
nodes results in slower cooperative imbibition front movements involving
several menisci.

<p>We present the Python-based Molecule Builder for ESPResSo (pyMBE), an open
source software designed to build coarse-grained models of polyelectrolytes,
peptides and globular proteins of arbitrary topology into the Extensible
Simulation Package for Research on Soft Matter (ESPResSo). ESPResSo features
the constant pH (cpH) and grand-reaction (G-RxMC) methods, which are powerful
tools to study macromolecular systems with many reactive groups, permitting to
efficiently sample systems with multiple coupled chemical equilibria. However,
setting up these methods for macromolecules with many different reactive groups
is a non-trivial and error-prone task, especially for beginners. pyMBE enables
the automatic setup of cpH and G-RxMC simulations in ESPResSo, lowering the
barrier for newcomers and opening the door to investigate complex systems not
yet studied with these methods. To demonstrate some of the applications of
pyMBE, we showcase several study cases where pyMBE successfully reproduces
previous simulations in the literature done with ESPResSo and other software,
including various simulations of different peptides in bulk solution,
simulations of weak polyelectrolytes in dialysis and simulations of globular
proteins in bulk solution. pyMBE is publicly available as a GitLab repository
(https://gitlab.com/blancoapa/pyMBE) which includes its source code and various
sample and test scripts, including the ones that we used to generated the data

slab, interfacing two $s$-wave superconductors. We present detailed study with
both time-reversal and inversion symmetry broken Weyl semimetals under
grounding, orbital magnetic fields, and Zeeman fields. An orbital magnetic
field induces energy level oscillations, while a Zeeman field give rise to the
periodic anomalous oscillations in the Josephson current. These anomalous
oscillations correlate with the separation of Weyl nodes in momentum space,

<h3>Noether invariance theory for the equilibrium force structure of soft  matter</h3>

<br>
<i>Sophie Hermann, Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt</i>
<p>We give details and derivations for the Noether invariance theory that
characterizes the spatial equilibrium structure of inhomogeneous classical
many-body systems, as recently proposed and investigated for bulk systems [F.
Samm\"uller $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{130}$, 268203 (2023)].
Thereby an intrinsic thermal symmetry against a local shifting transformation
on phase space is exploited on the basis of the Noether theorem for invariant
variations. We consider the consequences of the shifting that emerge at second
order in the displacement field that parameterizes the transformation. In a
natural way the standard two-body density distribution is generated. Its second
spatial derivative (Hessian) is thereby balanced by two further and different
two-body correlation functions, which respectively introduce coarse-grained
force correlations and force gradients in a systematic and microscopically
sharp way into the framework. Seperate exact self and distinct sum rules hold
expressing this balance. We exemplify the validity of the theory on the basis
of computer simulations for the Lennard-Jones gas, liquid, and crystal, the
Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid, monatomic Molinero-Moore water at ambient
conditions, a three-body-interacting colloidal gel former, the Yukawa and
soft-sphere dipolar fluids, and for isotropic and nematic phases of Gay-Berne
particles. We describe explicitly the derivation of the sum rules based on
Noether's theorem and also give more elementary proofs based on partial phase
space integration following Yvon's theorem.

<p>The wettability of surfaces determines their antifouling, antifogging,
anti-icing, and self-cleaning properties as well as their usability for
sensing, oil-water separation, water collection, and water purification.
Solvent-free high-temperature capillary stamping of stimuli-responsive polymers
yielding arrays of stimuli-responsive polymer microdots on differently modified
substrates enables the flexible generation of switchable surfaces with
different water contact angles (WCAs). Potential problems associated with the
deposition of polymer solutions, such as the handling of volatile organic
solvents, phase separation induced by solvent evaporation, and
capillarity-driven flow processes, are circumvented. We used composite stamps
with topographically patterned contact surfaces consisting of metallic nickel
cores and porous MnO2 coatings taking up the stimuli-responsive polymers. The
short transport paths from the MnO2 contact layers to the counterpart
substrates enabled the stamping of polymer melts containing components impeding
flow, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Thus-obtained arrays of polymer-CNT
hybrid microdots prevent problems associated with continuous coatings including
delamination and crack propagation. Moreover, the range within which the
properties of the stamped stimuli-responsive polymer microdots are switchable
can be tuned by orthogonal substrate modification. As an example, we stamped
hybrid microdots consisting of poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl
ferrocenecarboxylate) (PFcMA) and CNTs onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates.
Coating the ITO substrates with a poly(ethylene oxide)-terminated silane
shifted the WCAs obtained by switching the PFcMA between its oxidized and
reduced states by nearly 50{\deg}.

<br>
<i>Jan Meibohm, Massimiliano Esposito</i>
<p>We study driven $q$-state Potts models with thermodynamically consistent
dynamics and global coupling. For a wide range of parameters, these models
exhibit a dynamical phase transition from decoherent oscillations into a
synchronised phase. Starting from a general microscopic dynamics for individual
oscillators, we derive the normal form of the high-dimensional Hopf-Bifurcation
that underlies the phase transition. The normal-form equations are exact in the
thermodynamic limit and close to the bifurcation. Making use of the symmetry of
the model, we solve these equations analytically and thus uncover the intricate
stable synchronisation patterns of driven Potts models, characterised by a rich
phase diagram. Making use of thermodynamic consistency, we show that
synchronisation reduces dissipation in such a way that the most stable
synchronised states dissipate the least entropy. Close to the phase transition,
our findings condense into a linear dissipation-stability relation that
connects entropy production with phase-space contraction, a stability measure.
At finite system size, our findings suggest a minimum-dissipation principle for
driven Potts models that holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium.

<h3>Minimum-dissipation principle for synchronised stochastic oscillators  far from equilibrium</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Meibohm, Massimiliano Esposito</i>
<p>We prove a linear stability-dissipation relation (SDR) for $q$-state Potts
models driven far from equilibrium by a nonconservative force. At a critical
coupling strength, these models exhibit a synchronisation transition from a
decoherent into a synchronised state. In the vicinity of this transition, the
SDR connects the entropy production rate per oscillator to the phase-space
contraction rate, a measure of stability, in a simple way. For large but finite
systems, the SDR implies a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts
models as the dynamics selects stable non-equilibrium states with least
dissipation. This principle holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium, for any
stochastic dynamics, and for all $q$.

<br>
<i>Peigeng Zhong, Wei Pan, Haiqing Lin, Xiaoqun Wang, Shijie Hu</i>
<p>A biorthonormal-block density-matrix renormalization group algorithm is
proposed to compute properties of non-Hermitian many-body systems, in which a
structured low-rank approximation to a non-Hermitian reduced density matrix is
implemented to fulfill the prerequisite for the biorthonormality of the
renormalization transformation and to optimally construct a saved space as
well. A redundancy assigned to the saved space of the reduced density matrix is
exploited to reduce a condition number resulting from the left and right
transformation matrices, thus ensuring the numerical stability of the
renormalization procedure. The algorithm is successfully applied to an
interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with both nonreciprocal
hoppings and staggered complex chemical potential, exhibiting novel many-body
phenomena in the ground-state phase diagram.

<i>Fernando Peñaranda, Hector Ochoa, Fernando de Juan</i>
<p>The chiral lattice structure of twisted bilayer graphene with D6 symmetry
allows for intrinsic photogalvanic effects only at off-normal incidence, while
additional extrinsic effects are known to be induced by a substrate or a gate
potential. In this work, we first compute the intrinsic effects and show they
reverse sign at the magic angle, revealing a band inversion at the {\Gamma}
point. We next consider different extrinsic effects, showing how they can be
used to track the strengths of the substrate coupling or displacement field. We
also show that the approximate particle-hole symmetry implies stringent
constraints on the chemical potential dependence of all photocurrents. A
detailed comparison of intrinsic vs. extrinsic photocurrents therefore reveals
a wealth of information about the band structure and can also serve as a
benchmark to constrain the symmetry breaking patterns of correlated states.

<p>A pair of circularly polarized laser pulses of opposite helicities are shown
to control the route of spin reorientation phase transition in rare-earth
antiferromagnetic orthoferrite SmTbFeO$_3$. The route can be efficiently
controlled by the delay between the pulses and the sample temperature.
Simulations employing earlier published models of laserinduced spin dynamics in
orthoferrites failed to reproduce the experimental results. It is suggested
that the failure is due to neglected temperature dependence of the
antiferromagnetic resonance damping in the material. Taking into account the
experimentally deduced temperature dependence of the damping, we have been able
to obtain a good agreement between the simulations and the experimental
results.

<h3>Andreev conductance in disordered SF junctions with spin-orbit  scattering</h3>

<br>
<i>M. E. Ismagambetov, P. M. Ostrovsky, M. V. Feigel'man</i>
<p>We calculate the conductance of a junction between a disordered
superconductor and a very strong half-metallic ferromagnet admitting electrons
with only one spin projection. A usual mechanism of Andreev reflection is
strongly suppressed in this case since Cooper pairs are composed of electrons
with opposite spins. However, this obstacle can be overcome if we take into
account spin-orbit scattering inside the superconductor. Spin-orbit scattering
induces a fluctuational (zero on average) spin-triplet component of the
superconducting condensate, which is enough to establish Andreev transport into
a strong ferromagnet. This remarkably simple mechanism is quite versatile and
can explain long-range triplet proximity effect in a number of experimental
setups. One particular application of the suggested effect is to measure the
spin-orbit scattering time $\tau_{\text{SO}}$ in disordered superconducting
materials. The value of Andreev conductance strongly depends on the parameter
$\Delta \tau_\text{SO}$ and can be noticeable even in very disordered but
relatively light metals like granular aluminum.

<p>Certifying quantum entanglement is a critical step towards realizing
quantum-coherent applications of surface spin systems. In this work, we show
that entanglement can be unambiguously shown in a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) with electron spin resonance by exploiting the fact that entangled states
undergo a free time evolution with a distinct characteristic time constant that
clearly distinguishes it from any other time evolution in the system. By
implementing a suitable phase control scheme, the phase of this time evolution
can be mapped back onto the population of one entangled spin in a pair, which
can then be read out reliably using a weakly coupled sensor spin in the
junction of the scanning tunneling microscope. We demonstrate through open
quantum system simulations with realistic spin systems, which are currently
available with spin coherence times of $T_2\approx$ 300 ns, that a signal
directly correlated with the degree of entanglement can be measured at a
temperature range of 100$-$400 mK accessible in sub-Kelvin cryogenic STM
systems.

<p>We study the stability of the antiferromagnetic all-in--all-out state
observed in dipolar-octupolar pyrochlores that have neodymium as the magnetic
species. Different types of disorder are considered, either affecting the
immediate environment of the Nd$^{3+}$ ion, or substituting it with a
non-magnetic ion. Starting from the well studied Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ compound, Ti
substitution on the Zr site and dilution on the Nd magnetic site with La
substitution are investigated. The recently discovered entropy stabilized
compound NdMox, which exhibits a high degree of disorder on the non magnetic
site is also studied. Using a range of experimental techniques, especially very
low-temperature magnetization and neutron scattering, we show that the
all-in--all-out state is very robust and withstands substitutional disorder up
to large rates. From these measurements, we estimate the Hamiltonian parameters
and discuss their evolution in the framework of the phase diagram of
dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets.

<p>Cubic perovskite-structure ABO$_3$ and A$_{1-x}$A$^{\prime}$$_x$BO$_3$-type
oxides have been investigated extensively while their hexagonal-structure
versions have received minimal attention, even though they are multiferroic and
can form heterostructures with the manifold hexagonal two-dimensional
materials. Hexagonal ferrites of the form RFeO$_3$, where R is yttrium or a
rare-earth element such as Lu, Yb, etc., feature coupled ferroelectricity (FE)
and weak-ferromagnetism (wFM), exhibiting linear magnetoelectricity. Their only
drawback is weak ferromagnetism. In this paper, we employ
density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations on hexagonal LuFeO$_3$ ($h$-LFO),
targeting its magnetic ordering by electron doping,anticipating
spin-disproportionation of the Fe sublattices. Indeed, we show that
spin-disproportionation in heavily-electron-doped versions
Lu$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$FeO$_3$ ($h$-LHFO), especially for x=1/3 and 1/2, leads to
robust out-of-plane collinear ferrimagnetism that is stable at room
temperature. Furthermore, the robust ferroelectricity of $h$-LFO persists via a
Jahn-Teller metal-to-insulator transition. Finally, we construct a
$h$-LHFO/$h$-2D heterostructure, where $h$-2D stands for the FE/FM monolayer
MnSTe, and demonstrate strong magnetoelectric coupling, namely manipulation of
magnetic skyrmions in MnSTe by an external electric field through the $h$-LHFO
polarization, opening up a new realm for magnetoelectric applications.

<i>P. Xu, H. Luo</i>
<p>The latest field-effect transistors are entering the regime where quantum
effects within the conduction channel can play a significant role because of
the increasingly reduced dimensions. We investigate the effects of quantized
states in conduction channels in transistors. We use the standard configuration
of Si-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), as a
simplified model to provide an estimate of the effect of quantization with
respect to the dimensions of the conduction channel. The study shows the
simulated results of drain currents for various combinations of dimensions, in
which distinguishable current levels as a function of the applied gate bias can
be obtained at room temperature, and can be exploited for multinary
transistors. The same qualitative dependence on dimensions is expected to apply
to state-of-the-art transistor architectures with dimensions near this range,
such as fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) and gate-all-around field-effect
transistors (GAAFETs).
