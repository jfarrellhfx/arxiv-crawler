<h3>Friction mediated phase transition in confined active nematics</h3>

Using a minimal continuum model, we investigate the interplay between
circular confinement and substrate friction in active nematics. Upon increasing
the friction from low to high, we observe a dynamical phase transition from a
circulating flow phase to an anisotropic flow phase in which the flow tends to
align perpendicular to the nematic director at the boundary. We demonstrate
that both the flow structure and dynamic correlations in the latter phase
differ from those of an unconfined, active turbulent system and may be
controlled by the prescribed nematic boundary conditions. Our results show that
substrate friction and geometric confinement act as valuable control parameters
in active nematics.

<h3>Strong-coupling magnetophononics: Self-blocking, phonon-bitriplons, and  spin-band engineering</h3>

Magnetophononics, the modulation of magnetic interactions by driving
infrared-active lattice excitations, is emerging as a key mechanism for the
ultrafast dynamical control of both semiclassical and quantum spin systems by
coherent light. We demonstrate that, in a quantum magnet with strong
spin-phonon coupling, resonances between the driven phonon and the spin
excitation frequencies exhibit an intrinsic self-blocking effect, whereby only
a fraction of the available laser power is absorbed by the phonon. Using the
quantum master equations governing the nonequilibrium steady states of the
coupled spin-lattice system, we show how self-blocking arises from the
self-consistent alteration of the resonance frequencies. We link this to the
appearance of mutually repelling collective spin-phonon states, which in the
regime of strong hybridization become composites of a phonon and two triplons.
We then identify the mechanism and optimal phonon frequencies by which to
control a global nonequilibrium renormalization of the lattice-driven spin
excitation spectrum and demonstrate that this effect should be observable in
ultrafast THz experiments on a number of known quantum magnetic materials.

<h3>Using holographic microscopy to measure the effect of confinement on  crowding agents in lipid vesicles</h3>

The hydrodynamic effects of macromolecular crowding inside cells is often
studied in vitro by using polymers as crowding reagents. Confinement of
polymers inside cell-sized droplets has been shown to affect the diffusion of
small molecules. Here we develop a method, based on digital holographic
microscopy, to measure the diffusion of polystyrene microspheres that are
confined within lipid vesicles containing a high concentration of solute. We
find that diffusion inside and outside the vesicles is the same when the solute
is sucrose or dextran. However, for polyethylene glycol present at a
concentration higher than the critical overlap concentration, the diffusion of
microspheres inside vesicles is slower. This is likely evidence of the
confinement from the lipid bilayer restructuring the encapsulated crowding
agent.

<h3>Cell Division and Motility Enable Hexatic Order in Biological Tissues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00129" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00129</a>
<br>

Biological tissues transform between solid-like and liquid-like states in
many fundamental physiological events. Recent experimental observations further
suggest that in two-dimensional epithelial tissues these solid-liquid
transformations can happen via intermediate states akin to the intermediate
hexatic phases observed in equilibrium two-dimensional melting. The hexatic
phase is characterized by quasi-long-range (power-law) orientational order but
no translational order, thus endowing some structure to an otherwise
structureless fluid. While it has been shown that hexatic order in tissue
models can be induced by motility and thermal fluctuations, the role of cell
division and apoptosis (birth and death) has remained poorly understood,
despite its fundamental biological role. Here we study the effect of cell
division and apoptosis on global hexatic order within the framework of the
self-propelled Voronoi model of tissue. Although cell division naively destroys
order and active motility facilitates deformations, we show that their combined
action drives a liquid-hexatic-liquid transformation as the motility increases.
The hexatic phase is accessed by the delicate balance of dislocation defect
generation from cell division and the active binding of
disclination-antidisclination pairs from motility. We formulate a mean-field
model to elucidate this competition between cell division and motility and the
consequent development of hexatic order.

<h3>Escape dynamics of confined undulating worms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00647" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00647</a>
<br>
<i>Animesh Biswas, Arshad Kudrolli</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the escape dynamics of oligochaeta {\it Lumbriculus
variegatus} by confining them to a quasi-2D circular chamber with a narrow exit
passage. The worms move by performing undulatory and peristaltic strokes and
use their head to actively probe their surroundings. We show that the worms
follow the chamber boundary with occasional reversals in direction and with
velocities determined by the orientation angle of the body with respect to the
boundary. The average time needed to reach the passage decreases with its width
before approaching a constant, consistent with a boundary-following search
strategy. We model the search dynamics as a persistent random walk along the
boundary and demonstrate that the head increasingly skips over the passage
entrance for smaller passage widths due to body undulations. The simulations
capture the observed exponential time-distributions taken to reach the exit and
their mean as a function of width when starting from random locations. Even
after the head penetrates the passage entrance, we find that the worm does not
always escape because the head withdraws rhythmically back into the chamber
over distances set by the dual stroke amplitudes. Our study highlights the
importance of boundary following and body strokes in determining how active
matter escapes from enclosed spaces.

<h3>Cascade of vestigial orders in two-component superconductors: nematic,  ferromagnetic, s-wave charge-4e, and d-wave charge-4e states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00653</a>
<br>
<i>Matthias Hecker, Roland Willa, Jörg Schmalian, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<br>
<br>
Electronically ordered states that break multiple symmetries can melt in
multiple stages, similarly to liquid crystals. In the partially-melted phases,
known as vestigial phases, a bilinear made out of combinations of the multiple
components of the primary order parameter condenses. Multi-component
superconductors are thus natural candidates for vestigial order, since they
break both the U(1)-gauge and also time-reversal or lattice symmetries. Here,
we use group theory to classify all possible real-valued and complex-valued
bilinears of a generic two-component superconductor on a tetragonal or
hexagonal lattice. While the more widely investigated real-valued bilinears
correspond to vestigial nematic or ferromagnetic order, the little explored
complex-valued bilinears correspond to a vestigial charge-$4e$ condensate,
which itself can have an underlying $s$-wave, $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, or
$d_{xy}$-wave symmetry. To properly describe the fluctuating regime of the
superconducting Ginzburg-Landau action and thus access these competing
vestigial phases, we employ both a large-N and a variational method. We show
that while vestigial order can be understood as a weak-coupling effect in the
large-N approach, it is akin to a moderate-coupling effect in the variational
method. Despite these distinctions, both methods yield similar results in wide
regions of the parameter space spanned by the quartic Landau coefficients.
Specifically, we find that the nematic and ferromagnetic phases are the leading
vestigial instabilities, whereas the various types of charge-$4e$ order are
attractive albeit subleading vestigial channels. The only exception is for the
hexagonal case, in which the nematic and $s$-wave charge-4e vestigial states
are degenerate. We discuss the limitations of our approach, as well as the
implications of our results for the realization of exotic charge-4e states in
material candidates.

<h3>Scale-dependent theory of the disordered electron liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00655" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00655</a>
<br>
<i>A. M. Finkel'stein, G. Schwiete</i>
<br>
<br>
We review the scaling theory of disordered itinerant electrons with e-e
interactions. We first show how to adjust the microscopic Fermi-liquid theory
to the presence of disorder. Then we describe the non-linear sigma model (NLSM)
with interactions (Finkel'stein's model). This model is closely connected to
the Fermi liquid, but is more generally applicable, since it can also be viewed
as a minimal effective functional describing disordered interacting electrons.
Our discussion emphasizes the general structure of the theory, and the
connection of the scaling parameters to conservation laws. We then move on to
discuss the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the disordered electron liquid
in two and three dimensions. This MIT is a non-trivial example of a quantum
phase transition. The NLSM approach allows to identify the dynamical exponent
connecting the spatial and energy scales, which is central for the description
of the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior in the critical region of the MIT in
three dimensions. In two dimensions, the system can be discussed in terms of a
flow in the disorder-interaction phase plane, which is controlled by a fixed
point. We demonstrate that the two-parameter RG-equations accurately describe
electrons in Si-MOSFETs including the observed non-monotonic behavior of the
resistance and its strong drop at low temperatures. The theory can also be
applied to systems with an attractive interaction in the Cooper channel, where
it describes the suppression of superconductivity in disordered amorphous
films. We extend our discussion to heat transport in the two-dimensional
electron liquid. Similar to the electric conductivity, the thermal conductivity
also acquires logarithmic corrections induced by electron interaction and
disorder. The resulting thermal conductivity can be calculated in the NLSM
formalism after introducing so-called gravitational potentials.

<h3>Statics and diffusive dynamics of surfaces driven by $p$-atic  topological defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00007</a>
<br>
<i>Farzan Vafa, L. Mahadevan</i>
<br>
<br>
Inspired by epithelial morphogenesis, we consider a minimal model for the
shaping of a surface driven by $p$-atic topological defects. We show that a
positive (negative) defect can dynamically generate a (hyperbolic) cone whose
shape evolves diffusively, and predict that a defect of charge $+1/p$ leads to
a final semi-cone angle $\beta$ which satisfies the inequality $\sin\beta \ge 1
- \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{2p^2}$. By exploiting the fact that for axisymmetric
surfaces, the extrinsic geometry is tightly coupled to the intrinsic geometry,
we further show that the resulting stationary shape of a membrane with
negligible bending modulus and embedded polar order is a deformed lemon with
two defects at antipodal points. Finally, we close by pointing out that our
results may be relevant beyond epithelial morphogenesis in such contexts as
shape transitions in macroscopic closed spheroidal surfaces such as pollen
grains.

<h3>Quantum equilibration and measurements -- bounds on speeds, Lyapunov  exponents, and transport coefficients obtained from the uncertainty relations  and their comparison with experimental data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00021</a>
<br>
<i>Saurish Chakrabarty, Zohar Nussinov</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss our recent study of local quantum mechanical uncertainty relations
in quantum many body systems. These lead to fundamental bounds for quantities
such as the speed, acceleration, relaxation times, spatial gradients and the
Lyapunov exponents. We additionally obtain bounds on various transport
coefficients like the viscosity, the diffusion constant, and the thermal
conductivity. Some of these bounds are related to earlier conjectures, such as
the bound on chaos by Maldacena, Shenker and Stanford while others are new. Our
approach is a direct way of obtaining exact bounds in fairly general settings.
We employ uncertainty relations for local quantities from which we strip off
irrelevant terms as much as possible, thereby removing non-local terms. To
gauge the utility of our bounds, we briefly compare their numerical values with
typical values available from experimental data. In various cases, approximate
simplified variants of the bounds that we obtain can become fairly tight, i.e.,
comparable to experimental values. These considerations lead to a minimal time
for thermal equilibrium to be achieved. Building on a conjectured relation
between quantum measurements and equilibration, our bounds, far more
speculatively, suggest a minimal time scale for measurements to stabilize to
equilibrium values.

Interactions among electrons create novel many-body quantum phases of matter
with wavefunctions that often reflect electronic correlation effects, broken
symmetries, and novel collective excitations. A wide range of quantum phases
has been discovered in MATBG, including correlated insulating, unconventional
superconducting, and magnetic topological phases. The lack of microscopic
information, including precise knowledge of possible broken symmetries, has
thus far hampered our understanding of MATBG's correlated phases. Here we use
high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy to directly probe the
wavefunctions of the correlated phases in MATBG. The squares of the
wavefunctions of gapped phases, including those of the correlated insulators,
pseudogap, and superconducting phases, show distinct patterns of broken
symmetry with a $\sqrt{3}$ x $\sqrt{3}$ super-periodicity on the graphene
atomic lattice that has a complex spatial dependence on the moir\'e
superlattice scale. We introduce a symmetry-based analysis to describe our
measurements of the wavefunctions of MATBG's correlated phases with a set of
complex-valued local order parameters. For the correlated insulators in MATBG,
at fillings of $\nu$ = $\pm$ 2 electrons per moir\'e unit cell relative to
charge neutrality, we compare the observed quantum textures to those expected
for proposed theoretical ground states. In typical MATBG devices, the textures
of correlated insulators' wavefunctions closely match those of the
theoretically proposed IKS order, while in ultra-low-strain samples our data
has local symmetries like those of a T-IVC phase. We also study the
wavefunction of MATBG's superconducting state, revealing strong signatures of
intervalley coherence that can only be distinguished from those of the
insulator with our phase-sensitive measurements.

<h3>On weak ergodicity breaking in mean-field spin glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00026</a>

<i>Giampaolo Folena, Francesco Zamponi</i>
<br>
<br>
The weak ergodicity breaking hypothesis postulates that out-of-equilibrium
glassy systems lose memory of their initial state despite being unable to reach
an equilibrium stationary state. It is a milestone of glass physics, and has
provided a lot of insight on the physical properties of glass aging. Despite
its undoubted usefulness as a guiding principle, its general validity remains a
subject of debate. Here, we present evidence that this hypothesis does not hold
for a class of mean-field spin glass models. While most of the qualitative
physical picture of aging remains unaffected, our results suggest that some
important technical aspects should be revisited.

<h3>Accurate dynamics from self-consistent memory in stochastic chemical  reactions with small copy numbers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00029" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00029</a>
<br>
<i>Moshir Harsh, Peter Sollich</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a method that captures the fluctuations beyond mean field in
chemical reactions in the regime of small copy numbers and hence large
fluctuations, using self-consistently determined memory: by integrating
information from the past we can systematically improve our approximation for
the dynamics of chemical reactions. This memory emerges from a perturbative
treatment of the effective action of the Doi-Peliti field theory for chemical
reactions. By dressing only the response functions and by the self-consistent
replacement of bare responses by the dressed ones, we show how a very small
class of diagrams contributes to this expansion, with clear physical
interpretations. From these diagrams, a large sub-class can be further resummed
to infinite order, resulting in a method that is stable even for large values
of the expansion parameter or equivalently large reaction rates. We demonstrate
this method and its accuracy on single and multi-species binary reactions
across a range of reaction constant values.

It is pointed out that the simulations presented by Zhu et al. PRL 120,
144502, (2018) were not ran to a stationary state. The claim of Zhu et al. that
they have found evidence to a transition to the ultimate state of heat transfer
predicted by Kraichnan (1962) is therefore not supported by the simulations.

<h3>Degenerate Topological Edge States in Multimer Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00053" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00053</a>
<br>
<i>Jun Li, Yaping Yang, C.M. Hu</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose and experimentally realize a class of quasi-one-dimensional
topological lattices whose unit cells are constructed by coupled multiple
identical resonators, with uniform hopping and inversion symmetry. In the
presence of path-induced effective zero hopping within the unit cells, the
systems are characterized by complete multimerization with degenerate $-1$
energy edge states for open boundary condition. Su-Schrieffer-Heeger subspaces
with fully dimerized limits corresponding to pairs of nontrivial flat bands are
derived from the Hilbert spaces. In particular, topological bound states in the
continuum (BICs) are inherently present in even multimer chains, manifested by
embedding the topological bound states into a continuous band assured by
bulk-boundary correspondence. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the
degenerate topological edge states and topological BICs in inductor-capacitor
circuits.

<h3>Translational and rotational nonGaussianities in homogeneous freely  evolving granular gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00057</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Megías, Andrés Santos</i>
<br>
<br>
The importance of roughness in the modeling of granular gases has been
increasingly considered in recent years. In this work, a freely evolving
homogeneous granular gas of inelastic and rough hard disks or spheres is
studied under the assumptions of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The
homogeneous base state reached by the system is studied from a theoretical
point of view using a Sonine approximation, in contrast to a previous
Maxwellian approach. A general theoretical description is done in terms of
$d_t$ translational and $d_r$ rotational degrees of freedom, which accounts for
the cases of spheres ($d_t=d_r=3$) and disks ($d_t=2$, $d_r=1$) within a
unified framework. The nonGaussianities of the velocity distribution function
of this state are determined by means of the first nontrivial cumulants and by
the derivation of nonMaxwellian high-velocity tails. The results are validated
by computer simulations using direct simulation Monte Carlo and event-driven
molecular dynamics algorithms.

<h3>Combinatorial exploration of quantum spin liquid candidates in the  herbertsmithite material family</h3>

Geometric frustration of magnetic ions can lead to a quantum spin liquid
ground state where long range magnetic order is avoided despite strong exchange
interactions. The physical realization of quantum spin liquids comprises a
major unresolved area of contemporary materials science. One prominent
magnetically-frustrated structure is the kagome lattice. The naturally
occurring minerals herbertsmithite [ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$] and Zn-substituted
barlowite [ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$BrF] both feature perfect kagome layers of
spin-$1/2$ copper ions and display experimental signatures consistent with a
quantum spin liquid state at low temperatures. To investigate other possible
candidates within this material family, we perform a systematic
first-principles combinatorial exploration of structurally related compounds
[$A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_6B_2$ and $A$Cu$_3$(OH)$_6BC$] by substituting non-magnetic
divalent cations ($A$) and halide anions ($B$, $C$). After optimizing such
structures using density functional theory, we compare various structural and
thermodynamic parameters to determine which compounds are most likely to favor
a quantum spin liquid state. Convex hull calculations using binary compounds
are performed to determine feasibility of synthesis. We also estimate the
likelihood of interlayer substitutional disorder and spontaneous distortions of
the kagome layers. After considering all of these factors as a whole, we select
several promising candidate materials that we believe deserve further
attention.

<h3>Uncertainties in experiments on strongly-coupled vacuum field  modification of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00090</a>
<br>
<i>J. R. Cooper, L. Forró, A. Jánossy</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss recent experiments in which fine particles of the organic
superconductor Rb$_3$C$_{60}$ or the cuprate superconductor
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ are held in a polystyrene film that is spin-coated on to
a silicon substrate with or without an intervening gold, or another inert
metallic layer. From SQUID magnetisation data for Rb$_3$C$_{60}$ there appears
to be a striking and completely unexpected increase in the superconducting
transition temperature from $30$ to $45$~K, which is ascribed to coupling
between the electrons in the superconductor and vacuum fluctuations in the
electromagnetic field just above the metallic film. We argue that this could be
a non-intrinsic effect associated with the presence of solid oxygen in the
Pyrex sample tube. We suggest that the ferromagnetic SQUID signal observed for
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ particles in polystyrene could be attributed to
ferromagnetic particles or magnetic clusters of unknown origin.

<h3>Analytic calculation of the vison gap in the Kitaev spin liquid</h3>

Although the ground-state energy of the Kitaev spin liquid can be calculated
exactly, the associated vison gap energy has to date only been calculated
numerically from finite size diagonalization. Here we show that the phase shift
for scattering Majorana fermions off a single bond-flip can be calculated
analytically, leading to a closed-form expression for the vison gap energy
$\Delta = 0.2633J$. Generalizations of our approach can be applied to Kitaev
spin liquids on more complex lattices such as the three dimensional
hyper-octagonal lattice.

<h3>Percolation and conductivity in evolving disordered media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00107" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00107</a>
<br>
<i>Carl Fredrik Berg, Muhammad Sahimi</i>
<br>
<br>
Percolation theory and the associated percolation networks have provided deep
insights into the transport properties of a vast number of heterogeneous
materials and media. In practically all cases, however, the conductance of the
bonds of the networks remain constant throughout the entire process. There are,
however, many important problem in which the conductance of the bonds in the
networks evolves over time and does not remain constant. We introduce two
percolation models to study the evolution of the conductivity of such networks.
These two models are related to natural and industrial processes involving
clogging, precipitation, and dissolution. The effective conductivity of the
models are shown to follow known power laws near the percolation threshold,
despite radically different behavior both away from and even close to the
individual percolation threshold. The behavior of the networks close to the
percolation threshold are described by critical exponents, yielding bounds for
traditional critical exponents. We show that one of the two models belongs to
the traditional universality class of percolation conductivity, while the
second model yields non-universal scaling exponents.

<h3>Tilted Dirac cones and topological transitions in strained kagome  lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>M. A. Mojarro, Sergio E. Ulloa</i>
<br>
<br>
We study effects of strain on the electronic properties of the kagome lattice
in a tight-binding formalism with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The degeneracy at
the $\Gamma$ point evolves into a pair of emergent tilted Dirac cones under
uniaxial strain, where the anisotropy and tilting of the bands depend on the
magnitude and direction of the strain field. SOC opens gaps at the emergent
Dirac points, making the flatband topological, characterized by a nontrivial
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ index. Strains of a few percent drive the system into trivial or
topological phases. This confirms that moderate strain can be used to engineer
anisotropic Dirac bands with tunable properties to study new phases in kagome
lattices.

<br>
In this letter we summarise our study of Su-Schrieffer-Hegger(SSH) model with
a one dimensional non-orientable manifold as bulk. For this purpose a SSH model
with any bulk (SAB) is introduced. We observe the following: (1) The topology
of the SSH model is preserved even with a non-orientable bulk, (2) The
appearance of a doubly degenerate flat band exactly at the Fermi level, (3) At
half filling the band structure is metallic due to the complete overlap of
valence and conduction band but the electrons will be localised because the
bands are flat and (4) This system is unique because it has flat bands and at
the same time is topologically non-trivial.

<h3>Rashba spin-orbit coupling enhanced magnetoresistance in junctions with  one ferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00185" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00185</a>
<br>
<i>Chenghao Shen, Ranran Cai, Alex Matos-Abiague, Wei Han, Jong E. Han, Igor Zutic</i>
<br>
<br>
We explain how Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG), or in a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, can lead to a large
magnetoresistance even with one ferromagnet. However, such enhanced
magnetoresistance is not generic and can be nonmonotonic and change its sign
with Rashba SOC. For an in-plane rotation of magnetization, it is typically
negligibly small for a 2DEG and depends on the perfect transmission which
emerges from a spin-parity-time symmetry of the scattering states, while this
symmetry is generally absent from the Hamiltonian of the system. The key
difference from considering the normal-state magnetoresistance is the presence
of the spin-dependent Andreev reflection at superconducting interfaces. In the
fabricated junctions of quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnets with conventional
$s$-wave superconductors (Fe$_{0.29}$TaS$_2$/NbN) we find another example of
enhanced magnetoresistance where the presence of Rashba SOC reduces the
effective interfacial strength and is responsible for an equal-spin Andreev
reflection. The observed nonmonotonic trend in the out-of-plane
magnetoresistance with the interfacial barrier is an evidence for the
proximity-induced equal-spin-triplet superconductivity.

Weyl points exist in a fascinating topological state of matter with linear
band crossings analogous to magnetic monopoles. Tremendous efforts have been
devoted to investigate fermionic topological matters with Weyl points in the
single-particle band dispersion. It remains elusive for realizing
interaction-induced Weyl points, especially for bosons. Motivated by recent
experimental progress in ultracold atoms, we propose a scheme to create Weyl
points for Bogoliubov excitations of a bosonic superfluid in a
three-dimensional cubic optical lattice. The unique design of the lattice leads
to interaction-induced time-reversal symmetry breaking for a $p$-orbital
superfluid, which in turn induces Weyl Bogoliubov excitations. Analogous to
Weyl semimetals of electronic systems, the superfluid also support
topologically protected edge modes due to the bulk-boundary correspondence.

Negative differential conductance (NDC) manifests as a significant
characteristic of various underlying physics and transport processes in hybrid
superconducting devices. In this work, we report the observation of
gate-tunable NDC outside the superconducting energy gap on two types of hybrid
semiconductor-superconductor devices, i.e., normal metal-superconducting
nanowire-normal metal and normal metal-superconducting nanowire-superconductor
devices. Specifically, we study the dependence of the NDCs on back-gate voltage
and magnetic field. When the back-gate voltage decreases, these NDCs weaken and
evolve into positive differential conductance dips; and meanwhile they move
away from the superconducting gap towards high bias voltage, and disappear
eventually. In addition, with the increase of magnetic field, the NDCs/dips
follow the evolution of the superconducting gap, and disappear when the gap
closes. We interpret these observations and reach a good agreement by combining
the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model and the critical supercurrent effect
in the nanowire, which we call the BTK-supercurrent model. Our results provide
an in-depth understanding of the tunneling transport in hybrid
semiconductor-superconductor devices.

<br>
The influence of intrinsic defects of 1T-TaS2 on charge density waves (CDW)
is studied using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM, STS),
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), and density functional
theory (DFT). We identify several types of structural defects and find that
most have a local character limited to the single CDW site, with single
exception which effectively behaves as a dopant, leading to band bending and
affecting multiple neighboring sites. While only one type of defect can be
observed by STM topographic imaging, all defects are easily resolved by local
density of states (LDOS) mapping with STS. We correlate atomically-resolved STM
periodicity of defect-free 1T-TaS2 to top sulfur atoms and introduce tiling of
the surface using equiangular hexagon. DFT calculations (with included Coulomb
interactions) are used to investigate the electronic structure by introducing
sulfur vacancy or substituting sulfur with oxygen. The sulfur vacancy is
characterized by metallic properties and is identified as an origin of one of
observed experimentally defects. Whereas in the case of the latter, the
oxidation of 1T-TaS2 is found to result in the loss of magnetic properties
expected in defect-free material.

Microscopic formula to describe the entropy of biomolecular solutions are
derived based on the Gibbs formula of entropy, and the generalized Langevin
theory combined with the RISM/3D-RISM theory. Two formula are derived: one is
concerned with the conformational fluctuation of a biomolecule, and the other
with the density fluctuation of solvent around a solute. The formula derived
for the entropy associated with the conformational fluctuation is where N is
the number of atoms in the solute, and A is the determinant of the inverse of
the variance-covariance matrix of conformational fluctuation. The formula for
the entropy of solvent at a pair of positions around a solute is also derived
to be, where n is the number of atoms in a solvent molecule, and B is
essentially the determinant of the matrix of the density-pair-correlation
functions. The entropy at a local position r may be obtained by integrating the
expression by over the entire volume of the system.
The feasibility of the calculation to find the entropies is discussed.

Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ is a rare example of a layered ferrimagnet. It has
recently been shown to host a colossal angular magnetoresistance as the spin
orientation is rotated from the in- to out-of-plane direction, proposed to be
underpinned by a topological nodal-line degeneracy in its electronic structure.
Nonetheless, the origins of its ferrimagnetic structure remain controversial,
while its experimental electronic structure, and the role of correlations in
shaping this, are little explored to date. Here, we combine x-ray and
photoemission-based spectroscopies with first-principles calculations, to probe
the elemental-selective electronic structure and magnetic order in
Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. Through these, we identify a marked Mn-Te hybridisation,
which weakens the electronic correlations and enhances the magnetic anisotropy.
We demonstrate how this strengthens the magnetic frustration in
Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, which is key to stabilising its ferrimagnetic order, and
find a crucial role of both exchange interactions extending beyond
nearest-neighbours and anti-symmetric exchange in dictating its ordering
temperature. Together, our results demonstrate a powerful methodology of using
experimental electronic structure probes to constrain the parameter space for
first-principles calculations of magnetic materials, and through this approach,
reveal a pivotal role played by covalency in stabilising the ferrimagnetic
order in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$.

Temperature dependent resistivity exhibits metallic behavior with a slope
change above 200 K for Ag-doped Bi2Se3. The magnetoresistance shows positive
quadratic dependence at low fields satisfying Kohler's rule. Hall resistivity
measurement shows that electrons are dominant charge carriers. Furthermore,
these results agree well with the ARPES spectra observed at T = 20 K, where the
Fermi level lies inside the bulk conduction band. The Dirac point of the

<h3>Thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal phase-field modelling of  elastocaloric effect: indirect \textit{vs.} direct method</h3>

<br>
<br>
Modelling elastocaloric effect (eCE) is crucial for the design of
environmentally friendly and energy-efficient eCE based solid-state cooling
devices. Here, a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal phase-field model
(PFM) coupling martensitic transformation with mechanics and heat transfer is
developed and applied for simulating eCE. The model is derived from a
thermodynamic framework which invokes the microforce theory and Coleman--Noll
procedure. To avoid the numerical issue related to the non-differentiable
energy barrier function across the transition point, the austenite-martensite
transition energy barrier in PFM is constructed as a smooth function of
temperature. Both the indirect method using isothermal PFM with Maxwell
relations and the direct method using non-isothermal PFM are applied to
calculate the elastocaloric properties. The former is capable of calculating
both isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta
T_{\text{ad}}$), but induces high computation cost. The latter is
computationally efficient, but only yields $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$. In a model
Mn-22Cu alloy, the maximum $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$ ($\Delta
T_{\text{ad}}^{\text{max}}$) under a compressive stress of 100 MPa is
calculated as 9.5 and 8.5~K in single crystal (3.5 and 3.8~K in polycrystal)
from the indirect and direct method, respectively. The results demonstrate the
developed PFM herein, combined with both indirect and direct method for eCE
calculations, as a practicable toolkit for the computational design of
elastocaloric devices.

Finite-length armchair graphene nanoribbons can behave as one dimensional
topological materials, that may show edge states in their zigzag-terminated
edges, depending on their width and termination. We show here a full solution
of Tight-Binding graphene rectangles of any length and width that can be seen
as either finite-length armchair or zigzag ribbons. We find exact analytical
expressions for both bulk and edge eigen-states and eigen-energies. We write
down exact expressions for the Coulomb interactions among edge states and
introduce a Hubbard-dimer model to analyse the emergence and features of
different magnetic states at the edges, whose existence depends on the ribbon
length. We find ample room for experimental testing of our predictions in N = 5
armchair ribbons. We compare the analytical results with ab initio simulations
to benchmark the quality of the dimer model and to set its parameters. A
further detailed analysis of the ab initio Hamiltonian allows us to identify
those variations of the Tight-Binding parameters that affect the topological
properties of the ribbons.

<h3>Thermodynamic determination of the equilibrium first-order  phase-transition line hidden by hysteresis in a phase diagram</h3>

<br>
<br>
Phase diagrams form the basis for the study of material science, and the
profiles of phase-transition lines separating different thermodynamic phases
include comprehensive information about thermodynamic quantities, such as
latent heat. However, in some materials exhibiting field-induced first-order
transitions (FOTs), the equilibrium phase-transition line is hidden by the
hysteresis region associated with the FOT; thus, it cannot be directly
determined from measurements of resistivity, magnetization, etc. Here, we
demonstrate a thermodynamics-based method for determining the hidden
equilibrium FOT line. This method is verified for the FOT between
antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic states in magneto-electric compounds
(Fe$_{0.95}$Zn$_{0.05}$)$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. The equilibrium FOT line
determined based on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation exhibits a reasonable
profile in terms of the third law of thermodynamics, and it shows marked
differences from the midpoints of the hysteresis region. Our findings highlight
that care should be taken for referring to the hysteresis midpoint line when
discussing field-induced latent heat or magnetocaloric effects.

We study the steady-state distribution function of a run-and-tumble particle
evolving around a repulsive hard spherical obstacle. We show that the
well-documented activity-induced attraction translates into a delta peak
accumulation at the surface of the obstacle accompanied with an algebraic
divergence of the density profile close to the obstacle. We obtain the full
form of the distribution function in the regime where the persistence length of
the particle is much larger than the size of the obstacle. This provides an
expression for the low-density pair distribution function of a fluid of highly
persistent hard-core run-and-tumble particles.

We report tailed skyrmions -- a new class of stable soliton solutions of the
2D chiral magnet model. Tailed skyrmions have elongated shapes and emerge in a
narrow range of fields near the transition between the spin spirals and the
saturated state. We analyze the stability range of these solutions in terms of
external magnetic field and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Minimum energy paths
and the homotopies (continuous transitions) between tailed skyrmions of the
same topological charge have been calculated using the geodesic nudged elastic
bands method. The discovery of tailed skyrmions extends the diversity of
already-known solutions illustrated by complex morphology solitons, such as
tailed skyrmion bags with and without chiral kinks.

Tunneling light-emitting devices (LEDs) based on transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other 2D materials are a new platform for on-chip
optoelectronic integration. Some of the physical processes underlying this LED
architecture are not fully understood, especially the emission at photon
energies higher than the applied electrostatic potential, so-called overbias
emission. Here we report overbias emission for potentials that are near half of
the optical bandgap energy in TMD-based tunneling LEDs. We show that this
emission is not thermal in nature, but consistent with exciton generation via a
two-electron coherent tunneling process.

The static and dynamics properties of finite-size lattice quantum spin models
which spontaneously break a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry in the thermodynamic
limit are of central importance for a wide variety of physical systems, from
condensed matter to quantum simulation. Such systems are characterized by a
Goldstone excitation branch, terminating in a zero mode whose theoretical
treatment within a linearized approach leads to divergencies on finite-size
systems, revealing that the assumption of symmetry breaking is ill-defined away
from the thermodynamic limit. In this work we show that, once all its
non-linearities are taken into account, the zero mode corresponds exactly to a
U(1) quantum rotor, related to the Anderson tower of states expected in systems
showing symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit. The finite-momentum
modes, when weakly populated, can be instead safely linearized (namely treated
within spin-wave theory) and effectively decoupled from the zero mode. This
picture leads to an approximate separation of variables between rotor and
spin-wave ones, which allows for a correct description of the ground-state and
low-energy physics. Most importantly, it offers a quantitative treatment of the
finite-size non-equilibrium dynamics -- following a quantum quench -- dominated
by the zero mode, for which a linearized approach fails. Focusing on the 2$d$
XX model with power-law decaying interactions, we compare our equilibrium
predictions with unbiased quantum Monte Carlo results and exact
diagonalization; and our non-equilibrium results with time-dependent
variational Monte Carlo. The agreement is remarkable for all interaction
ranges, and it improves the longer the range. Our rotor/spin-wave theory
defines a successful strategy for the application of spin-wave theory and its
extensions to finite-size systems at equilibrium or away from it.

We report the evolution of the electronic structure at the surface of the
layered perovskite Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under large in-plane uniaxial compression,
leading to anisotropic $B_{1g}$ strains of
${\varepsilon_{xx}-\varepsilon_{yy}=-0.9\pm0.1\%}$. From angle-resolved
photoemission, we show how this drives a sequence of Lifshitz transitions,
reshaping the low-energy electronic structure and the rich spectrum of van Hove
singularities that the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ hosts. From comparison to
tight-binding modelling, we find that the strain is accommodated predominantly
by bond-length changes rather than modifications of octahedral tilt and
rotation angles. Our study sheds new light on the nature of structural
distortions at oxide surfaces, and how targeted control of these can be used to
tune density of states singularities to the Fermi level, in turn paving the way
to the possible realisation of rich collective states at the Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
surface.

The coherent transport of charge and spin is one key requirement of future
devices for quantum computing and communication. Scattering at defects or
impurities may seriously reduce the coherence of quantum-mechanical states,
thereby affecting device functionality. While numerous methods exist to
experimentally assess charge transport, the real-space detection of a
material's spin transport properties with nanometer resolution remains a
challenge. Here we report on a novel approach which utilizes a combination of
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) and the recently
introduced molecular nanoprobe (MONA) technique. It relies on the local
injection of spin-polarized charge carriers from a magnetic STM tip and their
detection by a single surface-deposited phthalocyanine molecule via reversible
electron-induced tautomerization events. Based on the particular electronic
structure of the Rashba alloy BiAg$_2$ which is governed by a
spin-momentum-locked surface state, we proof that the current direction
inverses as the tip magnetization is reversed by an external field. In a
proof-of-principle experiment we apply SP-MONA to investigate how a single Gd
cluster influences the spin-dependent charge transport of the Rashba surface
alloy.

The microscopic structure of two amorphous materials with extreme nonlinear
optical properties has been studied. One of these materials exhibits second
harmonic generation, while another material of similar molecular structure
emits brilliant white light if being irradiated with a simple IR laser diode.
Structural differences were investigated using X-ray scattering and EXAFS
combined with molecular RMC. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning
precession electron diffraction were used to understand specific structural
differences on all length scales, from mesoscopic down to mutual molecular
arrangements. Characteristic differences were found at all scales. Close
core-core spacing between {SnS} clusters as well as characteristic cluster
distortions appear to be characteristic features of the white light emitting
material. In the other material, cores are undistorted and core distances are
larger. There, the formation of nanocrystalline structures in the amorphous
matrix could also be identified as reason for the WLG suppression.

A 200 mm processing platform for the large-scale production of graphene
field-effect transistor-quantum dot (GFET-QD) hybrid photodetectors is
demonstrated. Comprehensive statistical analysis of electric data shows a high
yield (96%) and low variation of the 200 mm scale fabrication. The GFET-QD
devices deliver responsivities of 10${^5}$ - 10${^6}$ V/W in a wavelength range
from 400 to 1800 nm, at up to 100 frames per second. Spectral sensitivity
compares well to that obtained using similar GFET-QD photodetectors. The device
concept enables gate-tunable suppression or enhancement of the photovoltage,
which may be exploited for electric shutter operation by toggling between the
signal capture and shutter states. The devices show good stability at a wide
operation range and external quantum efficiency of 20% in the short-wavelength
infrared range. Furthermore, an integration solution with complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor technology is presented to realize image-sensor-array
chips and a proof-of-concept image system. This work demonstrates the potential
for the volume manufacture of infrared photodetectors for a wide range of

Interactions between out-of-plane dipoles in bosonic gases enable the
long-range propagation of excitons. The lack of direct control over collective
dipolar properties has hitherto limited the degrees of tunability and the
microscopic understanding of exciton transport. In this work, we modulate the
layer hybridization and interplay between many-body interactions of excitons in
a van der Waals heterostructure with an applied vertical electric field. By
performing spatiotemporally resolved measurements supported by microscopic
theory, we uncover the dipole-dependent properties and transport of excitons
with different degrees of hybridization. Moreover, we find constant emission
quantum yields of the transporting species as a function of excitation power
with dominating radiative decay mechanisms over nonradiative ones, a
fundamental requirement for efficient excitonic devices. Our findings provide a
complete picture of the many-body effects in the transport of dilute exciton
gases and have crucial implications for the study of emerging states of matter,
such as Bose-Einstein condensation, as well as for optoelectronic applications
based on exciton propagation.

State-of-the-art approaches to extract transport coefficients of many-body
quantum systems broadly fall into two categories: (i) they target the
linear-response regime in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of the
closed system; or (ii) they consider an open-system situation typically modeled
by a Lindblad equation, where a nonequilibrium steady state emerges from
driving the system at its boundaries. While quantitative agreement between (i)
and (ii) has been found for selected model and parameter choices, also
disagreement has been pointed out in the literature. Studying magnetization
transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, we here demonstrate that at weak driving,
the nonequilibrium steady state in an open system, including its buildup in
time, can remarkably be constructed just on the basis of correlation functions
in the closed system. We numerically illustrate this direct correspondence of
closed-system and open-system dynamics, and show that it allows the treatment
of comparatively large open systems, usually only accessible to matrix product
state simulations. We also point out potential pitfalls when extracting
transport coefficients from nonequilibrium steady states in finite systems.

Using the technique of supervised neural networks (NN), we study the phase
transitions of two-dimensional (2D) 6- and 8-state clock models on the square
lattice. The employed NN has only one input layer, one hidden layer of 2
neurons, and one output layer. In addition, the NN is trained without any prior
information about the considered models. Interestingly, despite its simple
architecture, the built supervised NN not only detects both the two
Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transitions but also determines the
transition temperatures with reasonable high accuracy. It is remarkable that a
NN, which has an extremely simple structure and is trained without any input
from the studied models, can be employed to study topological phase
transitions. The outcomes shown here as well as those previously demonstrated
in the literature suggest the feasibility of constructing a universal NN that
is applicable to investigate the phase transitions of many systems.

We consider the Majority Vote model coupled with scale-free networks. Recent
works point to a non-universal behavior of the Majority Vote model, where the
critical exponents depend on the connectivity while the network's effective
dimension $D_\mathrm{eff}$ is unity for a degree distribution exponent
$5/2<\gamma<7/2$. We present a finite-size theory of the Majority Vote Model
for uncorrelated networks and present generalized scaling relations with good
agreement with Monte-Carlo simulation results. The presented finite-size theory
has two main sources of size dependence. The first source is an external field
describing a mass media influence on the consensus formation and the second
source is the scale-free network cutoff. The model indeed presents
non-universal critical behavior where the critical exponents depend on the
degree distribution exponent $5/2<\gamma<7/2$. For $\gamma \geq 7/2$, the model
is on the same universality class of the Majority Vote model on Erd\"os-Renyi
random graphs, while for $\gamma=7/2$, the critical behavior presents
additional logarithmic corrections.

Mixed order phase transitions are transitions which have common features with
both first order and second order transitions. I review some results obtained
in the context of one of the prototypical models of mixed order transitions,
the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range coupling that decays as
truncated inverse square distance between spins. The correspondence between
this model and the Poland Scheraga model of DNA denaturation, a subject to
which Michael Fisher made substantial contribution, is then outlined.

The catalyst-free synthesis of graphene on dielectrics prevents the damage
induced by the transfer process. Although challenging, to master this synthesis
would boost the integration of graphene on consumer electronics since defects
hinder its optoelectronic properties. In this work, the influence of the
different surface terminations of c-plane sapphire substrates on the synthesis
of graphene via plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) is studied.
The different terminations of the sapphire surface are controlled by a plasma
etching process. A design of experiments (DoE) procedure was carried out to
evaluate the major effects governing the etching process of four different
parameters: i.e. discharge power, time, pressure and gas employed. In the
characterization of the substrate, two sapphire surface terminations were
identified and characterized by means of contact angle measurements, being a
hydrophilic (hydrophobic) surface the fingerprint of an Al- (OH-) terminated
surface, respectively. The defects within the synthesized graphene were
analysed by Raman spectroscopy. Notably, we found that the ID/IG ratio
decreases for graphene grown on OH-terminated surfaces. Furthermore, two
different regimes related to the nature of graphene defects were identified and
depending on the sapphire terminated surface are bound either to vacancy or
boundary like defects. Finally, studying the density of defects and the
crystallite area, as well as their relationship with the sapphire surface
termination paves the way for increasing the crystallinity of the synthesized
graphene.

Understanding electron irradiation effects is vital not only for reliable
characterization of materials using transmission electron microscopy, but
increasingly also for the controlled manipulation of two-dimensional materials.
Knock-on displacements due to elastic electron backscattering are theoretically
straightforward to model, and appear to correctly describe damage in pristine
graphene. For semiconducting MoS$_2$, some experimental and theoretical
progress has been recently made, indicating that a combination of elastic and
inelastic effects appears to be needed to explain experiments. For insulating
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), however, much less is currently known. We
measure the displacement cross sections of suspended monolayer hBN using
aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy in near
ultra-high vacuum at primary beam energies between 50 and 90~keV. We find
damage rates below 80~keV up to three orders of magnitude lower than previously
measured at hBN edges under comparatively poorer residual vacuum conditions
where chemical etching appears to have been the dominant damage mechanism.
Notably, we are now able to show that it is possible to create single vacancies
in hBN using electron irradiation, and resolve that boron are almost twice as
likely as nitrogen to be ejected below 80~keV. Moreover, any damage at such low
energies cannot be explained by pure elastic knock-on, even when accounting for
vibrations of the atoms. We thus develop a theoretical description that
accounts for a lowering of the displacement threshold energy due to valence
ionization resulting from inelastic scattering of probe electrons, and model
this using charge-constrained density functional theory molecular dynamics. Our
findings show the potential for defect-engineering of hBN at the level of
single vacancies using electron irradiation.

We study transport of interacting bosons through an Aharonov-Bohm cage - a
building block of flat band networks - with coherent pump and sink leads. In
the absence of interactions the cage is insulating due to destructive
interference. In the presence of mean field interactions the cage stays
insulating up to a critical value of the pump strength. Above the critical pump
strength the insulating state turns unstable, and the cage reshuffles with a
finite probability into a conducting state, and with a complementary
probability into a new insulating state. The precise state choice is depending
on tiny noise beyond any experimental or computational control. In the quantum
regime, particle pair transport induces weak conductance below the critical
pump strength. Above the critical pump strength more particles accumulate on
the cage. A swift crossover into a classical regime upon further pump strength
increase is observed, which agrees well with the pseudoclassical results.

We present ab initio calculations of hidden magnetoelectric multipolar order
in Cr$_2$O$_3$ and its iron-based analogue, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. First, we
discuss the connection between the order of such hidden multipoles and the
linear magnetoelectric effect. Next, we show the presence of hidden
antiferroically-ordered magnetoelectric multipoles in both the prototypical
magnetoelectric material Cr$_2$O$_3$, and centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$,
which has the same crystal structure as Cr$_2$O$_3$, but a different magnetic
dipolar ordering. In turn, we predict anti-magnetoelectric effects, in which
local magnetic dipole moments are induced in opposite directions under the
application of an external electric field, to create an additional
antiferromagnetic ordering. We confirm the predicted induced moments using
first-principles calculations. Our results demonstrate the existence of hidden
magnetoelectric multipoles leading to local linear magnetoelectric responses
even in centrosymmetric materials, where a net bulk linear magnetoelectric
effect is forbidden by symmetry.

<h3>Spontaneous Skyrmion Conformal Lattice and Transverse Motion During dc  and ac Compression</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use atomistic-based simulations to investigate the behavior of
ferromagnetic skyrmions being continuously compressed against a rigid wall
under dc and ac drives. The compressed skyrmions can be annihilated close to
the wall and form a conformal crystal with both a size and a density gradient,
making it distinct from conformal crystals observed previously for
superconducting vortices and colloidal particles. For both dc and ac driving,
the skyrmions can move transverse to the compression direction due to a
combination of density and size gradients. Forces in the compression direction
are converted by the Magnus force into transverse motion. Under ac driving, the
amount of skyrmion annihilation is reduced and we find a skyrmion Magnus
ratchet pump. We also observe shear banding in which skyrmions near the wall
move up to twice as fast as skyrmions further from the wall. When we vary the
magnitude of the applied drive, we find a critical current above which the
skyrmions are completely annihilated during a time scale that depends on the
magnitude of the drive. By varying the magnetic parameters, we find that the
transverse motion is strongly dependent on the skyrmion size. Smaller skyrmions
are more rigid, which interferes with the size gradient and destroys the
transverse motion. We also confirm the role of the size gradient by comparing
our atomistic simulations with a particle-based model, where we find that the
transverse motion is only transient. Our results are relevant for applications
where skyrmions encounter repulsive magnetic walls, domain walls, or
interfaces.

<h3>Universal mechanism of Ising superconductivity in twisted bilayer,  trilayer and quadrilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00583" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00583</a>
<br>
<i>J. Gonzalez, T. Stauber</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the superconducivity in twisted graphene multilayers originates
from a common feature, which is the strong valley symmetry breaking
characteristic of these moir\'e systems at the magic angle. This leads to a
breakdown of the rotational symmetry of the flat moir\'e bands down to $C_3$,
and to ground states in which the time-reversal symmetry is broken for a given
spin projection. However, this symmetry can be recovered upon exchange of
spin-up and spin-down electrons, as we illustrate by means of a self-consistent
microscopic Hartree-Fock resolution where the states for the two spin
projections acquire opposite sign of the valley polarization. There is then a
spin-valley locking by which the Fermi lines for the two spin projections are
different and related by inversion symmetry. This effect represents a large
renormalization of the bare spin-orbit coupling of the graphene multilayers,
lending protection to the superconductivity against in-plane magnetic fields.
In the twisted bilayer as well as in trilayer and quadrilayer graphene, the
pairing glue is shown to be given by the nesting between parallel segments of
the Fermi lines which arise from the breakdown of symmetry down to $C_3$. This
leads to a strong Kohn-Luttinger pairing instability, which is relevant until
the Fermi line recovers gradually a more isotropic shape towards the bottom of
the second valence band, explaining why the superconductivity fades away beyond
three-hole doping of the moir\'e unit cell.

We report experimental studies on a series of
Rb(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ (0.02 $\leq x \leq $ 0.9) powder and
single crystal samples using x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, magnetic
susceptibility, and electronic transport measurements. All compositions are
metallic and adopt the body-centered tetragonal structure with $I4/mmm$ space
group. Anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities measured on single crystal samples
suggest that Rb(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ undergo an evolution from
ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism, and finally to paramagnetism with
increasing Ni concentration. Neutron diffraction measurements on the samples
with $x$ = 0.1, 0.4, and 0.6 reveal an $A$-type antiferromagnetic order with
moments lying in the $ab$ plane. The moment size changes from 0.69 ($x=0.1$) to
2.80$\mu_B$ ($x=0.6$) per Co ions. Our results demonstrate that dilution of the
magnetic Co ions by substitution of nonmagnetic Ni ions induces magnetic
localization and evolution from itinerant to localized magnetism in
Rb(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2}$Se$_{2}$.

<br>
<br>
Inspired by path integral molecular dynamics, we build a spin model, in terms
of spin coherent states, from which we can compute the quantum expectation
values of a spin in a constant magnetic field. This formulation facilitates the
description of a discrete quantum spin system in terms of a continuous
classical model and recasts the quantum spin effects within the framework of
path integrals. In particular, it allows for a much more direct path to the
low- and high-temperature limits and to the definition of effective classical
Hamiltonians. In this formalism, the quantum properties of the spins are
described through an effective anisotropy. To check this, we solve the
effective classical model using atomistic spin dynamics, we calculate
thermodynamic observables and show that our effective classical models can
reproduce accurate quantum expectation values within the relevant temperature
ranges.

In this paper, we present a general covariant approach based on application
of the Noether's second theorem for derivation of the symmetric stress tensor
from the grand thermodynamic potential functional. We consider practically
important case when the density of the grand thermodynamic potential depends on
the first and second coordinate derivatives of the scalar order parameters. We
apply our approach to several models of the inhomogenous ionic fluids which
take into account the electrostatic correlations of ions or their short-range
correlations related to the packing effects: Cahn-Hilliard-like model,
Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev model, and Maggs-Podgornik-Blossey model. For all these
models, we derive analytical expressions for the symmetric stress tensors that
are consistent with the corresponding self-consistent field equations.

<br>
<br>
In kagome metals, the chiral current order $\eta$ with
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking is the source of various exotic electronic
states, while the method of controlling the current order and its interplay
with the star-of-David bond order $\phi$ are still unsolved. Here, we reveal
that tiny uniform orbital magnetization $M[\eta,\phi]$ is induced by the chiral
current order, and its magnitude is prominently enlarged under the presence of
the bond order. Importantly, we derive the magnetic-field ($h$)-induced
Ginzburg-Landau free energy expression $\Delta F[h,\eta,\phi]$, which enables
us to elucidate the field-induced current-bond phase transitions in kagome
metals. The emergent current-bond-$h$ trilinear coupling term in the free
energy, $-3m_1 h\eta\phi$, naturally explains the characteristic magnetic field
sensitive electronic states in kagome metals, such as the field-induced current
order and the strong interplay between the bond and current orders.

<br>
<br>
Kagome magnets are expected to feature emergent properties due to the
interplays among geometry, magnetism, electronic correlation, and band
topology. The magnetism and topological electronic states can be tuned via the
rare earth engineering in RV6Sn6 kagome metals, where R is a rare earth
element. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of SmV6Sn6, a
metal with two-dimensional kagome nets of vanadium and frustrated triangular Sm
lattice. Partial of the Sm atoms are shifted from the normal R positions by c/2
along the c axis. Magnetic measurements reveal obvious anisotropy, where the
easy magnetic axis is within the ab plane. Electronic transports show multiband
behaviors below 200 K. Density functional theory calculations find that the
electronic structure of SmV6Sn6 hosts flat bands, Dirac cone, and saddle point
arising from the V-3d electrons near the Fermi level. No evidence for the
existence of charge density wave or magnetic order down to 2 K can be observed.
Thus, SmV6Sn6 can be viewed as a modest disordered derivative of the RV6Sn6
structure, in which the disordered rare earth ions can suppress the magnetic
order and charge density wave in the RV6Sn6 kagome family.

<br>
<br>
It is well established that physical aging of amorphous solids is governed by
a marked change in dynamical properties as the material becomes older.
Conversely, structural properties such as the radial distribution function
exhibit only a very weak age dependence, usually deemed negligible with respect
to the numerical noise. Here we demonstrate that the extremely weak
age-dependent changes in structure are in fact sufficient to reliably assess
the age of a glass with the support of machine learning. We employ a supervised
learning method to predict the age of a glass based on the system's
instantaneous radial distribution function. Specifically, we train a multilayer
perceptron for a model glassformer quenched to different temperatures, and find
that this neural network can accurately classify the age of our system across
at least four orders of magnitude in time. Our analysis also reveals which
structural features encode the most useful information. Overall, this work
shows that through the aid of machine learning, a simple structure-dynamics
link can indeed be established for physically aged glasses.

<h3>Interplay between magnetism and short-range order in Ni-based  high-entropy alloys: CrCoNi, CrFeCoNi, and CrMnFeCoNi</h3>

<br>
<br>
The impact of magnetism on predicted atomic short-range order in Ni-based
high-entropy alloys is studied using a first-principles, all-electron,
Landau-type linear response theory, coupled with lattice-based atomistic
modelling. We perform two sets of linear-response calculations: one in which
the paramagnetic state is modelled within the disordered local moment picture,
and one in which systems are modelled in a magnetically ordered state. We show
that the treatment of magnetism can have significant impact both on the
predicted temperature of atomic ordering and also the nature of atomic order
itself. In CrCoNi, we find that the nature of atomic order changes from being
$L1_2$-like when modelled in the paramagnetic state to MoPt$_2$-like when
modelled assuming the system has magnetically ordered. In CrFeCoNi, atomic
correlations between Fe and the other elements present are dramatically
strengthened when we switch from treating the system as magnetically disordered
to magnetically ordered. Our results show it is necessary to consider the
magnetic state when modelling multicomponent alloys containing mid- to
late-$3d$ elements. Further, we suggest that there may be high-entropy alloy
compositions containing $3d$ transition metals that will exhibit specific
atomic short-range order when thermally treated in an applied magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
The electrical control of a material's conductivity is at the heart of modern
electronics. Conventionally, this control is achieved by tuning the density of
mobile charge carriers. A completely different approach is possible in Mott
insulators such as Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, where an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT)
can be induced by a weak electric field or current. This phenomenon has
numerous potential applications in, e.g., neuromorphic computing. While the
driving force of the IMT is poorly understood, it has been thought to be a
breakdown of the Mott state. Using in operando angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, we show that this is not the case: The current-driven conductive
phase arises with only a minor reorganisation of the Mott state. This can be
explained by the co-existence of structurally different domains that emerge
during the IMT. Electronic structure calculations show that the boundaries
between domains of slightly different structure lead to a drastic reduction of
the overall gap. This permits an increased conductivity, despite the persistent
presence of the Mott state. This mechanism represents a paradigm shift in the
understanding of IMTs, because it does not rely on the simultaneous presence of
a metallic and an insulating phase, but rather on the combined effect of
structurally inhomogeneous Mott phases.

We provide evidence that the spectrum of the local effective Hamiltonian and
the transfer operator in infinite-system matrix product state simulations are
identical up to a global rescaling factor, i.e.~the speed of light of the
system, when the underlying system is described by a 1+1 dimensional CFT. We
provide arguments for this correspondence based on a path integral point of
view. This observation turns out to yield very precise estimates for the speed
of light in practice, confirming exact results to high precision where
available, but also allowing us to finally determine the speed of light of the
non-integrable, critical $SU(2)$ Heisenberg chains with half-integer spin
$S>1/2$ with unprecedented accuracy. We also show that the same technology
applied to doped Hubbard ladders provides highly accurate velocities for a
range of dopings. Combined with measurements of compressibilities we present
new results for the Luttinger liquid parameter in the Luther-Emery regime of
doped Hubbard ladders, outperforming earlier approaches based on the fitting of
real-space correlation functions.

We investigate the nonequilibrium critical behavior of the contact process
with deterministic aperiodic temporal disorder implemented by choosing healing
or infection rates according to a family of aperiodic sequences based on the
quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence. This family allows us to gauge the temporal
fluctuations via a wandering exponent $\omega$ and put our work in the context
of the Kinzel--Vojta--Dickman criterion for the relevance of temporal disorder
to the critical behavior of nonequilibrium models. By means of analytic and
numerical calculations, the generalized criterion is tested in the mean-field
limit.

<h3>Strain-tuned quantum criticality in electronic Potts-nematic systems</h3>

<i>Anzumaan R. Chakraborty, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent observations of threefold rotational symmetry breaking in
twisted moir\'e systems, cold-atom optical lattices, quantum Hall systems, and
triangular antiferromagnets, we phenomenologically investigate the
strain-temperature phase diagram of the electronic 3-state Potts-nematic order.
While in the absence of strain the quantum Potts-nematic transition is
first-order, quantum critical points (QCP) emerge when uniaxial strain is
applied, whose nature depends on whether the strain is compressive or tensile.
In one case, the nematic amplitude jumps between two non-zero values while the
nematic director remains pinned, leading to a symmetry-preserving meta-nematic
transition that terminates at a quantum critical end-point. For the other type
of strain, the nematic director unlocks from the strain direction and
spontaneously breaks an in-plane twofold rotational symmetry, which in twisted
moir\'e superlattices triggers an electric polarization. Such a piezoelectric
transition changes from first to second-order upon increasing strain, resulting
in a quantum tricritical point. Using a Hertz-Millis approach, we show that
these QCPs share interesting similarities with the widely studied Ising-nematic
QCP. The existence of three minima in the nematic action also leaves
fingerprints in the strain-nematic hysteresis curves, which display multiple
loops. At non-zero temperatures, because the upper critical dimension of the
3-state Potts model is smaller than three, the Potts-nematic transition is
expected to remain first-order in 3D, but to change to second-order in 2D. As a
result, the 2D strain-temperature phase diagram displays two first-order
transition wings bounded by lines of critical end-points or tricritical points,
reminiscent of the phase diagram of metallic ferromagnets. We discuss how our
results can be used to unambiguously identify spontaneous Potts-nematic order.

<br>
<br>
Starting from the recently proposed dynamical exchange-correlation field
framework, the equation of motion of the diagonal part of the many-electron
Green function is derived, from which the spectral function can be obtained.
The resulting equation of motion takes the form of the continuity equation of
charge and current densities in electrodynamics with a source. An unknown
quantity in this equation is the current density, corresponding to the kinetic
energy. A procedure \`a la Kohn-Sham scheme is then proposed, in which the
difference between the kinetic potential of the interacting system and the
non-interacting Kohn-Sham system is shifted into the exchange-correlation
field. The task of finding a good approximation for the exchange-correlation
field should be greatly simplified since only the diagonal part is needed. A
formal solution to the continuity equation provides an explicit expression for
calculating the spectral function, given an approximate exchange-correlation
field.

The Eigenstate-Thermalization-Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as the
general framework to understand quantum statistical mechanics. Only recently
has the attention been paid to so-called generalized ETH, which accounts for
higher-order correlations among matrix elements, and that can be rationalized
theoretically using the language of Free Probability. In this work, we perform
the first numerical investigation of generalized ETH in physical many-body
systems with local interactions by testing the decomposition of higher-order
correlators into free cumulants. We perform exact diagonalization on two
classes of local non-integrable (chaotic) quantum many-body systems: spin chain
Hamiltonians and Floquet brickwork unitary circuits. We show that the dynamics
of four-time correlation functions are encoded in fourth-order free cumulants,
as predicted by ETH. Their non-trivial frequency dependence encodes the
physical properties of local many-body systems and distinguishes them from
structureless, rotationally invariant ensembles of random matrices.

emergence of an interfacial two-dimensional electron gas in NdNiO2/KTaO3(001)
involving the occupation of Ta $5d$ conduction-band states, which is twice as
pronounced as in NdNiO2/SrTiO3(001). We identify a significant anisotropic
$k^3$ Rashba spin splitting of the respective $d_{xy}$ states in both systems
that results from the broken inversion symmetry at the nickelate-substrate
interface and exceeds the width of the superconducting gap. In
NdNiO2/KTaO3(001), the splitting reaches 210 meV, which is comparable to
Bi(111) surface states. At the surface, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived states
exhibit a linear Rashba effect with $\alpha_\text{R} \sim$ 125 meV \r{A},
exemplifying its orbital selectivity. The corresponding Fermi sheets present a
reconstructed circular shape due to the electrostatic doping, but undergo a
Lifshitz transition towards a cuprate-like topology deeper in the film that
coincides with a realignment of their spin texture. These results promote
surface and interface polarity as interesting design parameters to control
spin-orbit physics in infinite-layer nickelate heterostructures.

In this work we study gapped boundary states of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bosonic
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in 4+1d, which are characterized by
mixed $\mathbb{Z}_N$-gravity response, and the closely related phases protected
by $C_N$ rotation symmetry. We show that except for a finite set of $N$'s, any
symmetry-preserving boundary theory is necessarily gapless for the root SPT
state. We then propose a 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to fermionic
matter as a candidate boundary theory for $N=2,4,8,16$, where the anomalous
symmetry is implemented by invertible topological defects obtained from gauging
2+1d chiral topological superconductors. For the $C_N$ case, we present an
explicit construction for the boundary states for $N=2,4,8,16$, and argue that
the construction fails for other values of $N$.

We consider the spin-1/2 XXX chain weakly perturbed away from integrability
by an isotropic next-to-nearest neighbor exchange interaction. Recently, it was
conjectured that this model possesses an infinite tower of quasiconserved
integrals of motion (charges) [D. Kurlov et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 104302
(2022)]. In this work we first test this conjecture by investigating how the
norm of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) scales with the system size, which
is known to be a remarkably accurate measure of chaos. We find that for the
perturbed XXX chain the behavior of the AGP norm corresponds to neither an
integrable nor a chaotic regime, which supports the conjectured
quasi-integrability of the model. We then prove the conjecture and explicitly
construct the infinite set of quasiconserved charges. Our proof relies on the
fact that the XXX chain perturbed by next-to-nearest exchange interaction can
be viewed as a truncation of an integrable long-range deformation of the
Heisenberg spin chain.

We formulate a general, continuous description of quantum spin systems in
thermal equilibrium when the average co-ordination number grows extensively in
the system size. Specifically, for sequences of dense graphs whose properties
converge in the thermodynamic limit we derive an elegant set of three coupled
non-linear Fredholm integral equations which govern the properties of the
system. In these equations the graphon, a continuous mathematical object
recently developed to describe such dense graph sequences, forms the kernel and
their solution yields exact expressions for the macroscopic observables in the
system in the thermodynamic limit. We analyse these equations for systems such
as the classical and transverse field Ising models, demonstrating how the
integral equations easily recover known results as well as providing analytical
solutions for a range of more complex cases. We also perform finite-size
numerical calculations with Monte-Carlo and Tensor Network methods and show
their convergence towards our analytical results.

The combined effect of disorder and interactions is central to the richness
of condensed matter physics and can lead to novel quantum states such as the
Bose glass phase in disordered bosonic systems. Here, we report on the
experimental realisation of the two-dimensional Bose glass using ultra-cold
atoms in an eight-fold symmetric quasicrystalline optical lattice. By probing
the coherence properties of the system, we observe a Bose glass to superfluid
transition and map out the phase diagram in the weakly interacting regime.
Moreover, we reveal the non-ergodic nature of the Bose glass by probing the
capability to restore coherence. Our observations are in good agreement with
recent quantum Monte Carlo predictions and pave the way for experimentally
testing the connection between the Bose glass, many-body localisation, and
glassy dynamics more generally.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an invaluable spectroscopic technique for
the characterization of molecular structures. NMR at high magnetic fields is
highly advantageous because of its high resolution, enabling the resolution of
small chemical shifts. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has enabled
widespread study of nanoscale NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at
low magnetic fields. However, low-field NV-detected NMR is limited in its
spectral resolution. In this work, we explore a method to measure NMR spectra
with intrinsic linewidths using high-frequency NV-detected NMR spectroscopy. We
perform $^{13}$C NV-detected NMR at the NV Larmor frequency of 115 GHz and
magnetic field of 4.2 Tesla. We analyze the contributions to the NMR linewidths
for two diamond samples and show that the method is capable of capturing the
intrinsic NMR spectrum. This work demonstrates a clear path to high resolution
NV-detected NMR at high fields.

<h3>Born effective charges and vibrational spectra in super and bad  conducting metals</h3>

Cooperative phenomena like superconductivity and charge-density wave arise
from the interaction between electrons mediated, e.g., by the electron-phonon
coupling. The same interaction mechanisms produce strong collision rates in the
normal phase of correlated metals, causing a sizeable reduction of dc
conductivity and reflectivity. As a consequence, low-energy excitations like
phonons, crucial for materials characterization, become visible in optical
infrared spectra. A quantitative assessment of vibrational resonances requires
the evaluation of dynamical Born effective charges (BECs), that quantify the
coupling between macroscopic electric fields and lattice deformations. We show
that the BECs of metals crucially depend on the collision regime of conducting
electrons. In particular, we describe, within a first principles framework, the
impact of electron scattering on the infrared vibrational resonances, from the
undamped (collisionless) to the overdamped (collision-dominated) regime. Our
approach enables the interpretation of vibrational reflectance measurements of
both super and bad conducting metals, as we illustrate for the case of strongly
electron-phonon coupled superhydride H$_3$S.

Superconductivity is a ubiquitous feature of graphite allotropes, having been
observed in Bernal bilayers, rhombohedral trilayers, and a wide variety of
angle-misaligned multilayers. Despite significant differences in the electronic
structure across these systems, supporting the graphite layer on a WSe$_2$
substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of
superconductivity in carrier density and temperature. Here, we report the
observation of two distinct superconducting states (denoted SC$_1$ and SC$_2$)
in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit
coupling. Quantum oscillations show that while the normal state of SC$_1$ is
consistent with the single-particle band structure, SC$_2$ emerges from a
nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are
robust to in-plane magnetic fields, violating the paramagnetic limit as
expected for spin-valley locked Ising superconductors. Our results show that
the enhancement of superconductivity in WSe$_2$ supported graphite allotropes
can be directly linked to Ising spin orbit coupling, which favors
valley-balanced ground states with time-reversal symmetric Fermi surfaces
friendly to superconducting pairing.
