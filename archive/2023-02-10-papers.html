<h3>A Lorentz violating low-energy model for the bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04327" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04327</a>
<br>
<i>Y. M. P. Gomes, M. J. Neves</i>

<br>
In this work, we propose a model with Lorentz symmetry violation which
describes the electronic low energy limit of the AA-bilayer graphene (BLG)
system. The AA-type bilayer is known to preserve the linear dispersion relation
of the graphene layer in the low energy limit. Theoretical modeling shows that
in the BLG system, a time-like vector can be associated with layer separation
and contributes to the energy eigenstates. Based on these properties, we can
describe in the $(2+1)$-dimensional space-time the fermionic quasi-particles
that emerge in the low-energy limit with the introduction of a Lorentz
violating parameter, in analogy with the $(3 + 1)$-dimensional Standard Model
Extension (SME). Moreover, we study the consequences of the coupling of these
fermionic quasi-particles with the electromagnetic field and we show via
effective action that the low-energy photon spectrum becomes massive. Finally,
by use of the hydrodynamic approach in the collisionless limit, one finds that
the LSV generates a new kind of hall current that couples the LSV vector to the
vortexes of the system.

<h3>Structural changes induced by electric currents in a single crystal of  Pr$_2$CuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04385" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04385</a>

We demonstrate a novel approach to the structural and electronic property
modification of perovskites, focusing on Pr$_2$CuO$_4$, an undoped parent
compound of a class of electron-doped copper oxide superconductors. Currents
were passed parallel or perpendicular to the copper oxygen layers with the
voltage ramped up until a rapid drop in the resistivity was achieved, a process
referred to as "Flash". The current was then further increased tenfold in
current-control mode. This state was quenched by immersion into liquid nitrogen
(LN$_2$). Flash can drive many compounds into different atomic structures with
new properties, whereas the quench freezes them into a long-lived state.
Single-crystal neutron diffraction of as-grown and modified Pr$_2$CuO$_4$
revealed a $\sqrt{10}$x$\sqrt{10}$ superlattice due to oxygen vacancy order.
The diffraction peak intensities of the superlattice of the modified sample
were significantly enhanced relative to the pristine sample. Raman-active
phonons in the modified sample were considerably sharper. Measurements of
electrical resistivity, magnetization and two-magnon Raman scattering indicate
that the modification affected only the Pr-O layers, but not the Cu-O planes.
These results point to enhanced oxygen vacancy order in the modified samples
well beyond what can be achieved without passing electrical current. Our work
opens a new avenue toward electric field/quench control of structure and
properties of layered perovskite oxides.

<h3>Superconducting diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04277" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04277</a>
<br>
<i>Tatiana de Picoli, Zane Blood, Yuli Lyanda-Geller, Jukka I. Väyrynen</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent observations of the superconducting diode effect pose the
challenge to fully understand the necessary ingredients for non-reciprocal
phenomena in superconductors. In this theoretical work, we focus on the
non-reciprocity of the critical current in a quasi-one-dimensional
superconductor. We define the critical current as the value of the supercurrent
at which the quasiparticle excitation gap closes (depairing). Once the critical
current is exceeded, the quasiparticles can exchange energy with the
superconducting condensate, giving rise to dissipation. Our minimal model can
be microscopically derived as a low-energy limit of a Rashba spin-orbit coupled
superconductor in a Zeeman field. Within the proposed model, we explore the
nature of the non-reciprocal effects of the critical current both analytically
and numerically. Our results quantify how system parameters such as spin-orbit
coupling and quantum confinement affect the strength of the superconducting
diode effect. Our theory provides a complementary description to
Ginzburg-Landau theories of the effect.

<h3>Non-Equilibrium View of the Amorphous Solidification of Liquids with  Competing Interactions</h3>

The interplay between short-range attractions and long-range repulsions
(SALR) characterizes the so called liquids with competing interactions, which
are known to exhibit a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases. The
theoretical description of the phenomenology associated to glassy or gel states
in these systems has to take into account both, the presence of thermodynamic
instabilities (such as those defining the spinodal line and the so called
$\lambda$ line) and the limited capability to describe genuine non-equilibrium
processes from first principles. Here we report the first application of the
non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory, to the
description of the dynamical arrest processes that occur in SALR systems after
being instantaneously quenched into a state point in the regions of
thermodynamic instability. The physical scenario predicted by this theory
reveals an amazing interplay between the thermodynamically-driven
instabilities, favoring equilibrium macro- and micro-phase separation, and the
kinetic arrest mechanisms, favoring non-equilibrium amorphous solidification of
the liquid into an unexpected variety of glass and gel states.

<h3>The fundamental thermodynamic costs of communication</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04320" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04320</a>
<br>
<i>Farita Tasnim, Nahuel Freitas, David H. Wolpert</i>
<br>
<br>
In many complex systems, whether biological or artificial, the thermodynamic
costs of communication among their components are large. These systems also
tend to split information transmitted between any two components across
multiple channels. A common hypothesis is that such inverse multiplexing
strategies reduce total thermodynamic costs. So far, however, there have been
no physics-based results supporting this hypothesis. This gap existed partially
because we have lacked a theoretical framework that addresses the interplay of
thermodynamics and information in off-equilibrium systems at any spatiotemporal
scale. Here we present the first study that rigorously combines such a
framework, stochastic thermodynamics, with Shannon information theory. We
develop a minimal model that captures the fundamental features common to a wide
variety of communication systems. We find that the thermodynamic cost in this
model is a convex function of the channel capacity, the canonical measure of
the communication capability of a channel. We also find that this function is
not always monotonic, in contrast to previous results not derived from first
principles physics. These results clarify when and how to split a single
communication stream across multiple channels. In particular, we present Pareto
fronts that reveal the trade-off between thermodynamic costs and channel
capacity when inverse multiplexing. Due to the generality of our model, our
findings could help explain empirical observations of how thermodynamic costs
of information transmission make inverse multiplexing energetically favorable
in many real-world communication systems.

<h3>Measurement-altered Ising quantum criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04325</a>
<br>
<i>Sara Murciano, Pablo Sala, Yue Liu, Roger S. K. Mong, Jason Alicea</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum critical systems constitute appealing platforms for the exploration
of novel measurement-induced phenomena due to their innate sensitivity to
perturbations. We study the impact of measurement on paradigmatic Ising quantum
critical chains using an explicit protocol, whereby correlated ancilla are
entangled with the critical chain and then projectively measured. Using a
perturbative analytic framework supported by extensive numerical simulations,
we demonstrate that measurements can qualitatively alter long-distance
correlations in a manner dependent on the choice of entangling gate, ancilla
measurement basis, measurement outcome, and nature of ancilla correlations.
Measurements can, for example, modify the Ising order-parameter scaling
dimension and catalyze order parameter condensation. We derive numerous
quantitative predictions for the behavior of correlations in select measurement
outcomes, and also identify two strategies for detecting measurement-altered
Ising criticality in measurement-averaged quantities. First, averaging the
square of the order-parameter expectation value over measurement outcomes
retains memory of order parameter condensation germinated in fixed measurement
outcomes -- even though on average the order parameter itself vanishes. Second,
we show that, in certain cases, observables can be averaged separately over
measurement outcomes residing in distinct symmetry sectors; we propose that
these `symmetry-resolved averages' reveal measurement effects even when
considering standard linearly averaged observables. Our framework naturally
adapts to more exotic quantum critical points and highlights opportunities for
potential experimental realization in Rydberg arrays.

<h3>Thermodynamics of Blackbody Radiation in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04367" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04367</a>
<br>
<i>I. Soares, R. Turcati, S. B. Duarte</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of three outstanding
nonlinear electrodynamics in a background uniform magnetic field, namely, the
generalized Born-Infeld, the Euler-Heisenberg and the Logarithmic
electrodynamics. In our approach, we will take into account temperatures below
the electron rest mass, i.e., $k_{B}T<<m_{e}c^{2}$. In this vein, we derive a
modified blackbody spectral distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law in this
situation. Considerations about the Wien's displacement law and the
Rayleigh-Jeans formula are contemplated as well. We then show the appearance of
an effective Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which depends on the strength of the
background magnetic field and the parameters for each electrodynamics model.
Deviations from the thermodynamic quantities at thermal equilibrium such as
energy, pressure, entropy and heat capacity densities are obtained from the
Helmholtz free energy. Possible implications on stellar systems with strong
magnetic fields such as Magnetars are discussed.

<h3>Bandwidth Control and Symmetry Breaking in a Mott-Hubbard Correlated  Metal</h3>

In Mott materials strong electron correlation yields a spectrum of complex
electronic structures. Recent synthesis advancements open realistic
opportunities for harnessing Mott physics to design transformative devices.
However, a major bottleneck in realizing such devices remains the lack of
control over the electron correlation strength. This stems from the complexity
of the electronic structure, which often veils the basic mechanisms underlying
the correlation strength. Here, we present control of the correlation strength
by tuning the degree of orbital overlap using picometer-scale lattice
engineering. We illustrate how bandwidth control and concurrent symmetry
breaking can govern the electronic structure of a correlated $SrVO_3$ model
system. We show how tensile and compressive biaxial strain oppositely affect
the $SrVO_3$ in-plane and out-of-plane orbital occupancy, resulting in the
partial alleviation of the orbital degeneracy. We derive and explain the
spectral weight redistribution under strain and illustrate how high tensile
strain drives the system towards a Mott insulating state. Implementation of
such concepts will enable to harness correlated electron phenomena towards new
solid state devices and circuits. These findings pave the way for understanding
and controlling electron correlation in a broad range of functional materials,
driving this powerful resource for novel electronics closer towards practical
realization.

<h3>Understanding the role of entropy in high entropy oxides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04394" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04394</a>

<br>
The field of high entropy oxides (HEOs) flips traditional materials science
paradigms on their head by seeking to understand what properties arise in the
presence of profound configurational disorder. This disorder, which originates
from multiple elements sharing a single lattice site, can take on a
kaleidoscopic character due to the vast numbers of possible elemental
combinations. High configurational disorder appears to imbue some HEOs with
functional properties that far surpass their non-disordered analogs. While
experimental discoveries abound, efforts to characterize the true magnitude of
the configurational entropy and understand its role in stabilizing new phases
and generating superior functional properties have lagged behind. Understanding
the role of configurational disorder in existing HEOs is the crucial link to
unlocking the rational design of new HEOs with targeted properties. In this
Perspective, we attempt to establish a framework for articulating and beginning
to address these questions in pursuit of a deeper understanding of the true
role of entropy in HEOs.

<h3>Designing Workflows for Materials Characterization</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Experimental science is enabled by the combination of synthesis, imaging, and
functional characterization. Synthesis of a new material is typically followed
by a set of characterization methods aiming to provide feedback for
optimization or discover fundamental mechanisms. However, the sequence of
synthesis and characterization methods and their interpretation, or research
workflow, has traditionally been driven by human intuition and is highly domain
specific. Here we explore concepts of scientific workflows that emerge at the
interface between theory, characterization, and imaging. We discuss the
criteria by which these workflows can be constructed for special cases of
multi-resolution structural imaging and structural and functional
characterization. Some considerations for theory-experiment workflows are
provided. We further pose that the emergence of user facilities and cloud labs
disrupt the classical progression from ideation, orchestration, and execution
stages of workflow development and necessitate development of universal
frameworks for workflow design, including universal hyper-languages describing
laboratory operation, reward functions and their integration between domains,
and policy development for workflow optimization. These tools will enable
knowledge-based workflow optimization, enable lateral instrumental networks,
sequential and parallel orchestration of characterization between dissimilar
facilities, and empower distributed research.

<h3>Minimal entropy production in the presence of anisotropic fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04401" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04401</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Anisotropy in temperature, chemical potential, or ion concentration, provides
the fuel that feeds dynamical processes that sustain life. At the same time,
anisotropy is a root cause of incurred losses manifested as entropy production.
In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped stochastic
thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and study minimum
entropy production when driving the system between thermodynamic states in
finite time. While entropy production in isotropic temperature environments can
be expressed in terms of the length (in the Wasserstein-2 metric) traversed by
the thermodynamic state of the system, anisotropy complicates substantially the
mechanism of entropy production since, besides dissipation, seepage of energy
between ambient anisotropic heat sources by way of the system dynamics is often
a major contributing factor. A key result of the paper is to show that in the
presence of anisotropy, minimization of entropy production can once again be
expressed via a modified Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) problem. However, in
contrast to the isotropic situation that leads to a classical OMT problem and a
Wasserstein length, entropy production may not be identically zero when the
thermodynamic state remains unchanged (unless one has control over
non-conservative forces); this is due to the fact that maintaining a
Non-Equilibrium Steady-State (NESS) incurs an intrinsic entropic cost that can
be traced back to a seepage of heat between heat baths. As alluded to, NESSs
represent hallmarks of life, since living matter by necessity operates far from
equilibrium. Therefore, the question studied herein, to characterize minimal
entropy production in anisotropic environments, appears of central importance
in biological processes and on how such processes may have evolved to optimize
for available usage of resources.

<h3>Intrinsic auxeticity and mechanical anisotropy of Si9C15 siligraphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04409" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04409</a>

<br>

The graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) silicon carbide or siligraphene has
attracted remarkable attentions, owing to its fascinating physical properties.
Nevertheless, the first high-quality siligraphene, i.e., monolayer Si9C15 was
synthesised very recently, which exhibits an excellent semiconducting
behaviour. In this work, we investigate the mechanical properties of Si9C15
siligraphene by using atomistic simulations including density functional theory
(DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both methods
confirm the existence of intrinsic negative Poisson's ratios in Si9C15
siligraphene, which, as illustrated by MD simulations, is attributed to the
tension-induced de-wrinkling behaviours of its intrinsic rippled configuration.
Different de-wrinkling behaviours are observed in different directions of
Si9C15 siligraphene, which result in the anisotropy of its auxetic property.
The fracture property of Si9C15 siligraphene is similarly anisotropic, but
relatively large fracture strains are observed in different orientations,
indicating the stretchability of Si9C15 siligraphene. The stretchability
together with the strain-sensitive bandgap of Si9C15 siligraphene observed in
DFT calculations indicates the effectiveness of strain engineering in
modulating its electronic property. The combination of unique auxetic property,
excellent mechanical property and tunable electronic property may render Si9C15
siligraphene a novel 2D material with multifunctional applications.

<h3>Observation of exceptional points and skin effect correspondence in  non-Hermitian phononic crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Exceptional points and skin effect, as the two distinct hallmark features
unique to the non-Hermitian physics, have each attracted enormous interests.
Recent theoretical works reveal that the topologically nontrivial exceptional
points can give rise to the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is
geometry-dependent. However, this kind of novel correspondence between the
exceptional points and skin effect remains to be confirmed by experiments.
Here, we corroborate the correspondence in a non-Hermitian phononic crystal.
The exceptional points connected by the bulk Fermi arcs, and the skin effects
with the geometry dependence, are evidenced in simulations and experiments. Our
work, building an experimental bridge between the exceptional points and skin
effect and uncovering the unconventional geometry-dependent skin effect,
expands a horizon in non-Hermitian physics.

<h3>Calorimetric measurement of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate in  metals</h3>

Quasiparticle mass measurements in correlated and quantum-critical metals
directly probe the effect of electronic correlations on the Fermi surface.
Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate measurements provide one such experimental
probe of electronic mass. So far, the spin-lattice relaxation rate can be
accessed only via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, which require
resonant excitation of nuclear spin transitions. Here we report non-resonant
access to spin-lattice relaxation dynamics in AC-calorimetric measurements. The
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate is inferred in our measurements from its
effect on the frequency dispersion of the thermal response of the
calorimeter-sample assembly. We use fast, lithographically-defined
nanocalorimeters to access the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times in
metallic indium from 0.3~K to 7~K and magnetic fields up to 35~T.

<h3>Disentangling $1/f$ noise from confined ion dynamics</h3>

Ion transport through biological and solid-state nanochannels is known to be
a highly noisy process. The power spectrum of current fluctuations is
empirically known to scale like the inverse of frequency, following the
long-standing yet poorly understood Hooge's law. Here, we report measurements
of current fluctuations across nanometer-scale two-dimensional channels with
different surface properties. The structure of fluctuations is found to depend
on channel's material. While in pristine channels current fluctuations scale
like $1/f^{1+a}$ with $a = 0 - 0.5$, the noise power spectrum of activated
graphite channels displays different regimes depending on frequency. Based on
these observations, we develop a theoretical formalism directly linking ion
dynamics and current fluctuations. We predict that the noise power spectrum
take the form $1/f \times S_\text{channel}(f)$, where $1/f$ fluctuations emerge
in fluidic reservoirs on both sides of the channel and $S_\text{channel}$
describes fluctuations inside it. Deviations to Hooge's law thus allow direct
access to the ion transport dynamics of the channel -- explaining the entire
phenomenology observed in experiments on 2D nanochannels. Our results
demonstrate how current fluctuations can be used to characterize nanoscale ion
dynamics.

<h3>A simple and general approach for reversible condensation polymerization  with cyclization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04483</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Lang, Kiran Suresh Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a simple recursive approach to treat reversible condensation
polymerization with cyclization. Based upon a minimum set of balance equations,
the law of mass action, Gaussian chain statistics, and the assumption of
independent reactions, we derive exact analytical solutions for systems without
cyclization, for systems containing only smallest loops, or systems that
exclusively form loops. Exact numerical solutions are computed for the general
case of a homopolymerization of flexible precursor polymers. All solutions were
tested with Monte-Carlo simulations. A generalization for good solvent is
discussed and it is shown that this generalization agrees with preceding work
in the limit of low and high polymer volume fractions. The new aspect of our
approach is its flexibility that allows for a rather simple generalization to
more complex situations. These include different kinds of reversible linear
polymerization, non-linear polymerization, first shell substitution effect,
semiflexibility, or a low molecular weight cut-off for cyclization.

<h3>Robust topological superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled systems at  higher-order van Hove filling</h3>

Van Hove singularities (VHSs) in proximity to the Fermi level promote
electronic interactions and generate diverse competing instabilities. It is
also known that a nontrivial Berry phase derived from spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
can introduce an intriguing decoration into the interactions and thus alter
correlated phenomena. However, it is unclear how and what type of new physics
can emerge in a system featured by the interplay between VHSs and the Berry
phase. Here, based on a general Rashba model on the square lattice, we
comprehensively explore such an interplay and its significant influence on the
competing electronic instabilities by performing a parquet renormalization
group analysis. Despite the existence of a variety of comparable fluctuations
in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels associated with
higher-order VHSs, we find that the chiral $p \pm ip$ pairings emerge as two
stable fixed trajectories within the generic interaction parameter space,
namely the system becomes a robust topological superconductor. The chiral
pairings stem from the hopping interaction induced by the nontrivial Berry
phase. The possible experimental realization and implications are discussed.
Our work sheds new light on the correlated states in quantum materials with
strong SOC and offers fresh insights into the exploration of topological
superconductivity.

<h3>Charge density wave with strong quantum phase fluctuations in Kagome  magnet FeGe</h3>

Charge density wave (CDW) can be characterized by the amplitude of its charge
modulation and the spatial phase coherence amongst CDW superlattice unit cells.
The phase coherence is usually guaranteed for weak-coupling CDW. However,
McMillan [Phys. Rev. B 16, 643 (1977)] predicted that in the strong coupling
regime, the phase fluctuation is strong and the coherence length of CDW could
be just a few superlattice unit cell size; a short-ranged CDW exists above the
transition, together with a CDW gap. In experiments, the short-ranged CDW with
small domains is often associated with defects, thus making it difficult to
identify the role of intrinsic phase fluctuations. Here, we report the
observation of a short-ranged CDW in Kagome magnet FeGe far below its CDW
transition temperature, and a pseudo gap in the non-CDW regions. Intriguingly,
it can be disrupted by gentle scans in a scanning tunneling microscope,
resulting in a metastable phase consisting of individual CDW nuclei independent
of defects. Our first-principle calculations show optical phonons in a sizable
momentum region soften similarly, which likely induces frustrations that could
destroy the phase coherence. These findings put the CDW state in FeGe in the
extreme strong-coupling limit with intrinsic quantum phase fluctuations, which
enriches the current understanding of CDW in the strong coupling regime.

Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic order has challenged our understanding the
fundamental and dynamic properties of magnetic materials. So far single shot
magnetic switching has been limited to ferrimagnetic alloys and multilayers. In
ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayers, exchange bias (He) arises
from the interfacial exchange coupling between the two layers and reflects the
microscopic orientation of the antiferromagnet. Here we demonstrate the
possibility of single shot switching of the antiferromagnet (change of the sign
and amplitude of He) with a single femtosecond laser pulse in IrMn/CoGd
bilayers. We demonstrate the switching for a wide range of fluences for
different layer thicknesses and compositions. Atomistic simulations predict
ultrafast switching and recovery of the AFM magnetization on a timescale of 2
ps. These results provide the fastest and the most energy-efficient method to
set the exchange bias and pave the way to potential applications for ultrafast
spintronic devices.

We present a theory and a calculation scheme of structural optimization at
finite temperatures within the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA). The theory is
based on an efficient scheme of updating the interatomic force constants with
the change of crystal structures, which we call the IFC renormalization. The
cell shape and the atomic coordinates are treated equally and simultaneously
optimized. We apply the theory to the thermal expansion and the pyroelectricity
of wurtzite GaN and ZnO, which accurately reproduces the experimentally
observed behaviors. Furthermore, we point out a general scheme to obtain
correct $T$ dependence at the lowest order in constrained optimizations that
reduce the number of effective degrees of freedom, which is helpful to perform
efficient QHA calculations with little sacrificing accuracy. We show that the
scheme works properly for GaN and ZnO by comparing with the optimization of all
the degrees of freedom.

The Fe$_{0.64}$Ni$_{0.36}$ alloy exhibits an anomalously low thermal
expansion at ambient conditions, an effect that is known as the invar effect.
Other Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$ alloys do not exhibit this effect at ambient
conditions but upon application of pressure even Ni-rich compositions show low
thermal expansion, thus called the pressure induced invar effect. We
investigate the pressure induced invar effect for Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$ for x =
0.64, 0.50, 0.25 by performing a large set of supercell calculations, taking
into account noncollinear magnetic states. We observe anomalies in the equation
of states for the three compositions. The anomalies coincide with magnetic
transitions from a ferromagnetic state at high volumes to a complex magnetic
state at lower volumes. Our results can be interpreted in the model of
noncollinear magnetism which relates the invar effect to increasing
contribution of magnetic entropy with pressure.

Niobium with its highest transition temperature among all elemental
superconductors has become a favorable substrate for realizing well-defined
low-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid systems exhibiting novel types of
exotic electronic states such as Majorana zero-energy modes. While a
preparation procedure for obtaining atomically clean Nb(110) substrates has
previously been reported, a suitable preparation method for clean Nb(111)
surfaces is still lacking. Here, we report a recipe for cleaning Nb(111)
surfaces based on an atomic hydrogen treatment followed by short flashes to
elevated temperatures. The atomic surface structure of clean non-reconstructed
Nb(111) is investigated by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
as well as a surface reconstruction with a reduced atom density compared to the
(111) plane of a bcc crystal resulting from a surface premelting at high
annealing temperatures.

<br>
<br>
A new method for analysing magnetization dynamics in spin textures under the
influence of fast electron injection from topological ferromagnetic sources
such as Dirac half metals has been proposed. These electrons, traveling at a
velocity $v$ with a non-negligible value of $v/c$ (where c is the speed of
light), generate a non-equilibrium magnetization density in the spin-texture
region, which is related to an electric dipole moment via relativistic
interactions. When this resulting dipole moment interacts with gauge fields in
the spin-texture region, an effective field is created that produces spin
torques. These torques, like spin-orbit torques that occur when electrons are
injected from a heavy metal into a ferromagnet, can display both damping-like
and anti-damping-like properties. We also discuss how this damping term can
affect domain wall motion.

<br>
<br>
Compact localized single particle eigenstates on a deterministic fractal
substrate, modelled by a triangular Sierpinski gasket of arbitrarily large
size, are unravelled and examined analytically. We prescribe an exact real
space renormalization group (RSRG) decimation scheme within a tight binding
formalism to discern these states, and argue that the number of such states can
be infinite if the fractal substrate is enlarged to its thermodynamic limit.
Interestingly, these localized states turn out to populate the non-dispersive,
flat bands in a periodic array of Sierpinski gasket motifs, however large they
may be. Our results match and corroborate the recently observed compact
localized, flat band states engineered on two dimensional photonic waveguide
networks with a fractal geometry, and provide a whole subset of them, which, in
principle, should be observable in fractal photonic lattice experiments.

Translation-invariant low-dimensional systems are know to exhibit anomalous
heat transport. There are examples of systems, however -- one is the
coupled-rotor chain -- in which translation invariance is satisfied,
nevertheless, transport is diffusive. It has been argued that the mechanism
behind normal diffusion restoration is the impossibility to define a global
stretch variable with a dynamical meaning. An alternative mechanism, proposed
in the present paper, is that the transition to anomalous heat transport occurs
at a scale that in certain circumstances may diverge to infinity. To illustrate
the mechanism, I consider the case of a composite chain that conserves local
energy and momentum as well as global stretch, and at the same time obeys, in
the continuous limit, Fourier's law of heat transport.

<br>
<br>
Half-Heusler compounds with 18 valence electrons per unit cell are well-known
non-magnetic semiconductors. Employing first-principles electronic band
structure calculations, we study the interface properties of the half-Heusler
heterojunctions based on FeVSb, CoTiSb, CoVSn, and NiTiSn compounds, which
belong to this category of materials. Our results show that several of these
heterojunction interfaces become not only metallic but also magnetic. The
emergence of spin-polarization is accompanied by the formation of
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) or hole gas (2DHG) at the interface. We
qualitatively discuss the origin of the spin polarization at the interfaces on
the basis of the Stoner model. For the cases of magnetic interfaces where
half-metallicity is also present, we propose a modified Slater-Pauling rule
similar to the one for bulk half-metallic half-Heusler compounds. Additionally,
we calculate exchange parameters, Curie temperatures and magnetic anisotropy
energies for magnetic interfaces. Our study, combined with the recent
experimental evidence for the presence of 2DEG at CoTiSb/NiTiSn heterojunctions
might motivate future efforts and studies toward the experimental realization
of devices using the proposed heterojunctions.

<h3>Scattering-dependent transport of SrRuO3 films: From Weyl fermion  transport to hump-like Hall effect anomaly</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent observation of quantum transport phenomena of Weyl fermions has
brought much attention to 4d ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 as a magnetic Weyl
semimetal. Besides, the hump-like Hall effect anomaly, which might have a
topological origin, has also been reported for this material. Here, we show
that the emergence of such phenomena is governed by the degree of scattering
determined by the defect density (Ru-deficiency- and/or interface-driven-defect
scattering) and measurement temperature (phonon scattering), where the former
is controlled by varying the growth conditions of the SrRuO3 films in molecular
beam epitaxy as well as the film thickness. The resulting electronic transport
properties can be classified into three categories: clean, intermediate, and
dirty regimes. The transport of Weyl fermions emerges in the clean regime,
whereas that of topologically trivial conduction electrons in the ferromagnetic
metal state prevail in the intermediate and dirty regimes. In the clean and
intermediate regimes, anomalous Hall resistivity obeys a scaling law
incorporating the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger (Berry phase) and extrinsic
side-jump mechanisms. The hump-like Hall effect anomaly is observed only in the
dirty regime, which is contrary to the scaling law between anomalous Hall
resistivity and longitudinal resistivity. Hence, we conclude that this anomaly
is not inherent to the material and does not have a topological origin. We also
provide defect- and temperature-dependent transport phase diagrams of
stoichiometric SrRuO3 and Ru-deficient SrRu0.7O3 where the appearance of Weyl
fermions and hump-like Hall effect anomaly are mapped. These diagrams may serve
as a guideline for designing SrRu1-xO3-based spintronic and topological
electronic devices.

<h3>q-Deformed and the Gross Pitaevskii Equation</h3>

<br>
<br>
We derive the Gross Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for condensate of bosons
obeying deformed statistics under external potential and inter-particle
interaction. First, we obtain the well-known Schrodinger equation. Using a
suitable Hamiltonian for condensate phase and minimizing the free energy of the
system, we find out the $q$- deformed GPE. Thus, at very low temperature, where
the dynamics of excited-occupation level can be neglected, the dynamics of a
deformed statistics system can be described by the GPE, similar to the
Bose-Einstein condensate.

<br>
<br>
Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$ is a centrosymmetric, layered van der Waals (vdW)
ferromagnet that displays Curie temperatures $T_c$ (270-330 K) that are within
the useful range for spintronic applications. However, little is known about
the interplay between its topological spin textures (e.g., merons, skyrmions)
with technologically relevant transport properties such as the topological Hall
effect (THE), or topological thermal transport. Here, we show via
high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy that merons and
anti-meron pairs coexist with N\'{e}el skyrmions in Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$ over a
wide range of temperatures and probe their effects on thermal and electrical
transport. We detect a THE, even at room $T$, that senses merons at higher $T$s
as well as their coexistence with skyrmions as $T$ is lowered indicating an
on-demand thermally driven formation of either type of spin texture.
Remarkably, we also observe an unconventional THE in absence of Lorentz force
and attribute it to the interaction between charge carriers and magnetic
field-induced chiral spin textures. Our results expose Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$ as a
promising candidate for the development of applications in skyrmionics/meronics
due to the interplay between distinct but coexisting topological magnetic
textures and unconventional transport of charge/heat carriers.

<h3>Straightforward Bias and Frequency Dependent Small-Signal Model  Extraction for Single-Layer Graphene FETs</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose an explicit small-signal graphene field-effect transistor (GFET)
parameter extraction procedure based on a charge-based quasi-static model. The
dependence of the small-signal parameters on both gate voltage and frequency is
precisely validated by high-frequency (up to 18 GHz) on-wafer measurements from
a 300 nm device. These parameters are studied simultaneously, in contrast to
other works which focus exclusively on few. Efficient procedures have been
applied to GFETs for the first time to remove contact and gate resistances from
the Y-parameters. The use of these methods yields straightforward equations for
extracting the small-signal model parameters, which is extremely useful for
radio-frequency circuit design. Furthermore, we show for the first time
experimental validation vs. both gate voltage and frequency of the intrinsic
GFET non-reciprocal capacitance model. Accurate models are also presented for
the gate voltage-dependence of the measured unity-gain and maximum oscillation
frequencies as well as of the current and power gains.

<h3>BCS-BCS crossover between atomic and molecular superfluids in a  Bose-Fermi mixture</h3>

<br>
<i>Yixin Guo, Hiroyuki Tajima, Tetsuo Hatsuda, Haozhao Liang</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically examine a continuity between atomic and molecular Fermi
superfluids in a Bose-Fermi mixture near the Feshbach resonance. Considering a
two-channel model describing the Feshbach resonance between Fermi and Bose
atoms, we have constructed the mean-field framework based on the perturbative
expansion of the Feshbach atom-dimer coupling. The resulting effective
Hamiltonian exhibits not only the continuity between atom-atom to
molecule-molecule Cooper pairings but also becomes equivalent to the
two-band-superconductor model with Suhl-Matthias-Walker type pair-exchange
coupling. We demonstrate how these atomic and molecular Fermi superfluids
coexist within the two-band-like superfluid theory. The pair-exchange coupling
and resulting superfluid gaps are found to be strongly enhanced near the
Feshbach resonance due to the interplay between the infrared singularity of
Bogoliubov phonons and their Landau damping arising from the coupling with
fermions. The pair-exchange coupling can be probed via the observation of the
intrinsic Josephson effect between atomic and molecular superfluids.

<h3>A slave fermion interpretation of the pseudogap in doped Mott insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04620" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04620</a>
<br>
<i>Zhuoqing Long, Jiangfan Wang, Yi-feng Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We apply the recently-developed slave fermion approach to study the doped
Mott insulator in the one-band Hubbard model. Our results produce several
subtle features in the electron spectra and confirm the key role of
antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations on the appearance of the pseudogap. Upon
hole doping, the electron spectra exhibit a single peak near the Fermi energy
in the absence of AFM correlations. When AFM correlations are included, a
second peak emerges at slightly lower energy and pushes the other peak to
higher energy, so that a pseudogap emerges between the two peaks at small
doping. Both peaks grow rapidly with increasing doping and eventually merge
together, where the pseudogap no longer exists. Detailed analyses of the
spectral evolution with doping and AFM correlations as well as its momentum
dependence confirm that the lower-energy peak comes from a polaronic mechanism
due to the holon-spinon interaction in the AFM correlated background and the
higher-energy peak arises from the holon hybridization to form the electron
quasiparticles. Thus, the pseudogap arises from the interplay of the polaronic
and hybridization mechanisms. Our results are in good agreement with previous
numerical calculations using the dynamical mean-field theory and its cluster
extensions, but give a clearer picture of the underlying physics. Our work
provides a promising perspective for clarifying the nature of doped Mott
insulators and may serve as a starting point for more elaborate investigations
in the future.

<h3>Doniach phase diagram for Kondo lattice model on the square and  triangular lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Geometric frustration adds a new competing energy scale to the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kondo lattice model (KLM). In this work, we
systematically study the doniach phase diagram on the square and triangular
lattices in the same theoretical framework and reveal unexpected responses of
it on the two lattices. The potential energy created by the geometric
frustration is comparable to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling,
which completely suppresses the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order on the
half-filled triangular lattice. While, on the square lattice, the long-range
AFM order successfully establishes and constitutes the conventional competition
between the RKKY and Kondo couplings. The geometrical frustration on the
triangular lattice is partially released when doped with holes, in which two
different magnetic orders emerge unexpectedly. The two orders closely relate to
the topology of the interacting Fermi surface. Our comprehensive comparison of
the KLM on the two lattices not only reveals a significant competition of
geometric frustration, RKKY, and Kondo couplings on low-dimensional systems but
also sheds light on experimentally finding new phases in related materials.

Hydrogen, a simple and magic element, has attracted increasing attention for
its effective incorporation within solids and powerful manipulation of
electronic states. Here, we show that hydrogenation tackles common problems in
two-dimensional borophene, e.g., stability and applicability. As a prominent
example, a ladder-like boron hydride sheet, named as 2D ladder polyborane,
achieves the desired outcome, enjoying the cleanest scenario with an
anisotropic and tilted Dirac cone, that can be fully depicted by a minimal
two-band tight-binding model. Introducing external fields, such as an electric
field or a circularly-polarized light field can effectively induce distinctive
massive Dirac fermions, whereupon four types of multi-field-driven topological
domain walls hosting tunable chirality and valley indexes are further
established. Moreover, the 2D ladder polyborane is thermodynamically stable at
room temperature and supports highly switchable Dirac fermions, providing an
ideal platform for realizing and exploring the various multi-field-tunable
electronic states.

<h3>Spin-dependent recombination mechanisms for quintet bi-excitons  generated through singlet fission</h3>

<br>
<i>Yan Sun, L. R. Weiss, V. Derkach, J. E. Anthony, M. Monteverde, A. D. Chepelianskii</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the physical mechanisms for spin-dependent recombination of a
strongly bound pair of triplet excitons generated by singlet fission and
forming a spin quintet (total spin of two) bi-exciton. For triplet excitons the
spin-dependent recombination pathways can involve intersystem crossing or
triplet-triplet annihilation back to the singlet ground state. However the
modeling of spin-dependent recombination for quintets is still an open
question. Here we introduce two theoretical models and compare their
predictions with the broadband optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum
of a long lived quintet bi-exciton with known molecular structure. This
spectrum measures the change in the fluorescence signal induced by microwave
excitation of each of the ten possible spin transitions within the quintet
manifold as function of the magnetic field. While most of the experimental
features can be reproduced for both models, the behavior of some of the
transitions is only consistent with the quintet spin-recombination model
inspired by triplet intersystem crossing which can reproduce accurately the
experimental two-dimensional spectrum with a small number of kinetic
parameters. Thus quantitative analysis of the broadband optically detected
magnetic resonance signal enables quantitative understanding of the dominant
spin-recombination processes and estimation of the out-of equilibrium spin
populations.

<br>
<br>
he manifestation of intra-molecular strains in covalent systems is widely
known to accelerate chemical reactions and open alternative reaction paths.
This process is moderately understood for isolated molecules and uni-molecular
processes. However, in condensed matter processes such as phase
transformations, material properties and structure may influence typical
mechanochemical effects. Therefore, we utilize steered molecular dynamics to
induce out of plane strains in graphite and compress the system under a
constant strain rate to induce phase transformation. We show that the out of
plane strain allows for phase transformations to initiate at lower amounts of
compressive strain. Yet, in contrast to typical mechanochemical results, the
sum of compressive and out of plane work needed to form diamond has a local
minimum due to altered defect formation processes during phase transformation.
Additionally, these altered processes slow the kinetics of the phase
transformation, taking longer from initiation to total material transformation.

We present a phase diagram of Bose-Hubbard model with on-site chemical
potential disorder at two dimensions within the scope of mean-field theory. The
phase diagram in the disorder strength ($\Delta$) and the on-site repulsion
($U$) for disordered BHM at fixed filling $\langle{n\rangle}=1$, show
interesting re-entrance of superfluid phase, sandwiched between Bose-glass
phases, as observed by the previous QMC results. We probe the Bose-glass to
superfluid transition, as a percolation transition, based on the mean-field
results at various parts of the phase diagram using both $\Delta$ and $U$ as
the tuning parameter. We argue the robustness of the re-entrant superfluid.

<h3>Meissner effect induced Majorana zero modes at small magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiao-Hong Pan, Li Chen, Dong E. Liu, Fu-Chun Zhang, Xin Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
One fundamental difficulty in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is the
required high magnetic field, which causes serious issues, e.g., shrinks the
superconducting gap, reduces topological region, and weakens their robustness
against disorder. In this work, we propose that the Meissner effect can bring
the topological superconducting phase to a
superconductor/topological-insulator/superconductor (SC/TI/SC) hybrid system.
Remarkably, the required magnetic field strength ($<$10 mT) to support MZMs has
been reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to that ($>$0.5 T) in the
previous schemes. Tuning the phase difference between the top and bottom
superconductors can control the number and position of the MZMs. In addition,
we account for the electrostatic potential in the
superconductor/topological-insulator (SC/TI) interface through the
self-consistent Schr\"odinger-Poisson calculation, which shows the experimental
accessibility of our proposal. Our proposal only needs a small magnetic eld of
less than 10 mT and is robust against the chemical potential fluctuation, which
makes SC/TI/SC hybrid an ideal Majorana platform.

<br>
<br>
Members of the CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$ series have been
synthesized by high-temperature solution growth in single crystalline form and
characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, magnetic and transport
measurements. The effects of Cr substitution on the superconducting and
magnetic ground states of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ ($T_c$ = 35 K) have been studied.
These measurements show that the superconducting transition temperature
decreases monotonically and is finally suppressed below 1.8 K as $x$ is
increased from 0 to 0.038. The magnetic transition temperature increases in a
roughly linear manner as Cr substitution increases. A temperature-composition
(\textit{T}-\textit{x}) phase diagram is constructed, revealing a half-dome of
superconductivity with the magnetic transition temperature, $T^*$, appearing
near 22~K for $x$ $\sim$ 0.017 and rising slowly up to 60~K for $x$ $\sim$
0.077. The $T$-$x$ phase diagrams for CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$$T$$_{x}$)$_4$As$_4$ for
$T$ = Cr and Mn are essentially the same despite the nominally different band
filling; this is in marked contrast to $T$ = Co and Ni series for which the
$T$-$x$ diagrams scale by a factor of two, consistent with the different
changes in band filling Co and Ni would produce when replacing Fe.
Superconductivity of CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$ is also studied as a
function of magnetic field. A clear change in $H^\prime_{c2}$($T$)/$T_c$, where
$H^\prime_{c2}$($T$) is d$H_{c2}$($T$)/d$T$, at $x$ $\sim$ 0.012 is observed
and probably is related to change of the Fermi surface due to magnetic order.
Coherence length and the London penetration depths are also calculated based on
$H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ data. Coherence lengths as the function of $x$ also shows
changes near $x$ = 0.012, again consistent with Fermi surfaces changes
associated with the magnetic ordering seen for higher $x$-values.

We study the performance of an endoreversible magnetic Otto cycle with a

performance, quantified by the power, work, efficiency, and parameter region
where the cycle operates as an engine. We demonstrate that a parameter region
exists where the efficiency at maximum output power exceeds the Curzon-Ahlborn

nematic clusters. We emphasize that special care has to be taken within the

non-equilibrium critical behavior. The calculations were carried out for both
high-temperature and low-temperature initial states. The characteristic
correlation time, which diverges at the transition temperature in the
thermodynamic limit, was obtained as a function of system size and waiting
time.

Using mean-field approximations, this paper identifies a phase transition in
a three-dimensional Electron Glass lattice model. The density of states of the
eigenvalue distribution of the inverse susceptibility matrix is used to
identify the possibility of a phase transition. In the thermodynamic limit, the
eigenvalue spectrum appears to extend to zero as $T \approx T_{c}$. To
determine the dynamical relaxation laws near the transition temperature, we use
the eigenvalue distribution of the linear dynamical matrix. Our analysis
distinguishes between the phenomenon of phase transition and slow dynamics.

The Laves phase skeleton in cast Mg-Al-Ca alloys is known to provide
considerable strengthening. Laves phases such as CaMg$_2$ (C14), Ca(Al,Mg)$_2$
(C36), and CaAl2 (C15) have high melting points, high hardness at room and
elevated temperatures, but unfortunately are inherently brittle. Mg-Al-Ca
alloys thus have good creep properties but limited ductility. An understanding
of the co-deformation behaviour of $\alpha$-Mg and Laves phases is essential
for optimising the strength-ductility balance of these alloys. Here, we study
the mechanical behaviour of a Mg-4.65Al-2.82Ca alloy using micropillar
compression in the $\alpha$-Mg matrix, at $\alpha$-Mg/C36 and $\alpha$-Mg/C15
interfaces and in the C15 phase in combination with scanning electron
microscopy (SE imaging), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission
Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), and low-kV scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM). We show that both, C15 and C36, Laves phases provide considerable
strengthening to the $\alpha$-Mg matrix by delaying the onset of basal slip and
extension twinning, while only the C36 phase appears to allow a certain extent
of slip transfer/ plastic co-deformation, in spite of its greater anisotropy
compared with the cubic C15 phase. We therefore conclude based on these results
that strengthening of the $\alpha$-Mg matrix by the C36 Laves phase is
preferable given that it combines easy skeleton formation with some
co-deformation and considerable stability at common application temperatures of
magnesium alloys.

Spin-triplet superconductors represent a fascinating platform with which to
explore the technological potential of emergent topological excitations. While
candidate triplet superconductors are rare, one especially promising material
is the heavy fermion paramagnet uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$), which has
recently been found to exhibit numerous characteristics of an unconventional
spin-triplet pairing state. To date, efforts to understand the microscopic
details of superconductivity in UTe$_2$ have been severely impeded by
uncertainty regarding the underlying electronic structure. Here, we directly
probe the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ by measuring magnetic quantum oscillations
in ultra-pure crystals, as evidenced by their high superconducting transition
temperature $T_\text{c} \approx$ 2.1 K and residual resistivity ratio (RRR)
$\approx$ 900. We find an angular profile of quantum oscillatory frequency and
amplitude that is characteristic of a quasi-2D Fermi surface, exhibiting heavy
effective masses up to 78(2) $m_e$ owing to strong correlations. We performed
Fermi surface simulations guided by these data, yielding excellent
correspondence between quantum oscillation measurements and our resultant Fermi
surface model. Interestingly, these results indicate that the UTe$_2$ Fermi
surface is similar in character to that of notable other unconventional
superconductors, such as the iron-pnictides and underdoped high-$T_\text{c}$
cuprates, consisting of two cylindrical sections of electron- and hole-type
respectively. We find that both cylindrical Fermi sheets possess negligible
corrugation, which may allow for their near-nesting and therefore promote
magnetic fluctuations that enhance the triplet pairing mechanism. Our results
place strong constraints on the possible symmetry of the superconducting order
parameter in UTe$_2$.

Nanotechnology offers the promise of harnessing quantum properties not
available in the bulk phase. These desirable properties are highly dependent on
size and composition. Generators that control these variables are therefore
essential for progress in the field. The spark discharge generator (SDG) is an
outstanding aerosol route for nanoparticle synthesis, which stands out due to
its fast kinetics, scalability, high purity, accuracy and reproducibility with
the added advantage of allowing the synthesis of nanoparticles of any
conducting material. These advantages are a consequence of its vast heating and
cooling rates, its intrinsic and easily controllable electronic variables at
the reach of a click. However, the mechanistic impact of these variables on the
actual aerosol generated is still not fully understood. In this work, we
constructed an SDG and systematically studied its behavior with particular
interest in the effect that resistance, capacitance, inductance, flow rate, gap
separation and current have on the electrical behavior of the spark. Our model
system produced primarily Fe and Cu nanoparticles with measured concentrations.
We discuss how the spark influences particle size and number concentration and
provide useful correlations that link dependent with independent variables.
Remarkably, a finite resistance produces a maximum in the output of the
generated aerosols. This suggests a direct link between RLC properties of the
circuit and cabling into the frequency of the spark, and nanoparticle number
concentration, indicating potential for exploiting such behavior towards
maximizing nanoparticle generation. Furthermore, we discuss a link between
spark oscillations and energy release with its consequent aerosol generation.

<h3>Electron-irradiation-facilitated production of chemically homogenized  nanotwins in nanolaminated carbides</h3>

Twin boundaries have been exploited to stabilize ultrafine grains and improve
the mechanical properties of nanomaterials. The production of twin boundaries
and nanotwins is however prohibitively challenging in carbide ceramics. Using
scanning transmission electron microscopes as a unique platform for
atomic-scale structure engineering, we demonstrate that twin platelets could be
produced in carbides by engineering antisite defects. Antisite defects at metal
sites in various layered ternary carbides are collectively and controllably
generated and the metal elements are homogenized by electron irradiation, which
transforms the twin-like lamellae into nanotwin platelets. Accompanying the
chemical homogenization, {\alpha}-Ti3AlC2 transforms to unconventional
\b{eta}-Ti3AlC2. The chemical homogeneity and the width of the twin platelets
can be tuned by the dose and energy of bombarding electrons. Chemically
homogenized nanotwins can boost the hardness by ~45%. Our results provide a new
way to produce ultrathin (<5 nm) nanotwin platelets in scientifically and
technologically important carbide materials and showcase the feasibility of
defect engineering by an angstrom-sized electron probe.

The interplay between topological defects, such as dislocations or
disclinations, and the electronic degrees of freedom in graphene has been
extensively studied. In the literature, for the study of this kind of problems,
it is in general used either a gauge theory or a curved spatial Riemannian
geometry approach, where, in the geometric case, the information about the
defects is contained in the metric and the spin-connection. However, these
topological defects can also be associated to a Riemann-Cartan geometry where
curvature and torsion plays an important role. In this article we study the
interplay between a wedge dislocations in a planar graphene sheet and the
properties of its electronic degrees of freedom. Our approach relies in its
relation with elasticity theory through the so called elastic-gauge, where
their typical coefficients, as for example the Poisson's ratio, appear directly
in the metric, and consequently also in the electronic spectrum.

<h3>Mach--Zehnder-like interferometry with graphene nanoribbon networks</h3>

We study theoretically electron interference in a Mach--Zehnder-like geometry
formed by four zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) arranged in parallel pairs,
one on top of the other, such that they form intersection angles of 60$^\circ$.
Depending on the interribbon separation, each intersection can be tuned to act
either as an electron beam splitter or as a mirror, enabling tuneable circuitry
with interfering pathways. Based on the mean-field Hubbard model and Green's
function techniques, we evaluate the electron transport properties of such
8-terminal devices and identify pairs of terminals that are subject to
self-interference. We further show that the scattering matrix formalism in the
approximation of independent scattering at the four individual junctions
provides accurate results as compared with the Green's function description,
allowing for a simple interpretation of the interference process between two
dominant pathways. This enables us to characterize the device sensitivity to
phase shifts from an external magnetic flux according to the Aharonov--Bohm
effect as well as from small geometric variations in the two path lengths. The
proposed devices could find applications as magnetic field sensors and as
detectors of phase shifts induced by local scatterers on the different
segments, such as adsorbates, impurities or defects. The setup could also be
used to create and study quantum entanglement.

We review the main methods used to study spin glasses. In the first part, we
focus on methods for fully connected models and systems defined on a tree, such
as the replica method, the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer formalism, the cavity
method, and the dynamical mean-field theory. In the second part, we deal with
the description of low-dimensional systems, mostly in three spatial dimensions,
which are mostly studied through numerical simulations. We conclude by
mentioning some of the main open problems in the field.

TbMn6Sn6 is a metallic ferrimagnet that displays signatures of band topology
arising from a combination of uniaxial ferromagnetism and spin-orbit coupling
within its Mn kagome layers. Whereas the low energy magnetic excitations can be
described as collective spin waves using a local moment Heisenberg model,
sharply defined optical and flat-band collective magnon modes are not observed.
In their place, we find overdamped chiral and flat-band spin correlations that
are localized to hexagonal plaquettes within the kagome layer.

Nanomagnetic materials, built from thin, patterned films of ferromagnetic
materials, began as analogues to frustrated magnetism. Their low energy of
operation and emergent properties make them strong candidates for physics based
devices. A recent model of how nanomagnetic domains flip, the Glauber
mean-field model, is used here to understand how systems of nanomagnets evolve
when opposed by external field. This reversal can be expressed in an analytical
form in the case of one-dimensional chains and trees at zero temperature, where
the cascade of spin flips gives rise to harmonic power spectra. The same
cascades in two and three dimensions form fractal field reversal clusters whose
shape depends on the strength of the field and the tuning of interactions
between nanomagnets.

<h3>Large shift current in cubic and hexagonal LiZn$X$ semiconductors</h3>

The rectified bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in noncentrosymmetric
semiconductors, also called shift current, is considered a promising
alternative to the conventional $p$-$n$ junction based solar cell applications.
A clear understanding of the shift current mechanism and search for materials
with large shift current is, therefore, of immense interest. $ABC$
semiconductors LiZn$X$ ($X$ = N, P, As and Sb) can be stabilized in cubic as
well as hexagonal morphologies lacking inversion symmetry -- an ideal platform
to investigate the significant contributing factors to shift current, such as
the role of structure and the chemical species. Using density-functional
calculations properly accounting for the electronic bandgaps, the shift current
conductivities in LiZn$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb) are found to be approximately an
order of magnitude larger than the well-known counterparts and peak close to
the maximum solar radiation intensity. Notably, hexagonal LiZnSb shows a peak
shift current conductivity of $\sim 75 ~\mu$A/V$^2$, comparable to highest
predicted values in literature. Our comparative analysis of the shift current
response not only posits Li-Zn-based $ABC$ semiconductors as viable material
candidates for potential applications, but also elucidates the structure-BPVE
relationship and paves way for accelerated development in this direction.

Free electrons hopping on hyperbolic lattices embedded on a curved space of
negative curvature can foster (a) Dirac liquids, (b) Fermi liquids, and (c)
flat bands, respectively characterized by a vanishing, constant, and divergent
density of states near the half-filling. From numerical self-consistent
Hartree-Fock analyses, here we show that the nearest-neighbor and on-site
Coulomb repulsions respectively give rise to charge-density-wave and
antiferromagnetic orders featuring staggered patterns of average electronic
density and magnetization in all these systems, when the hyperbolic
tessellation is accomplished by periodic arrangements of even $p$-gons. Both
quantum orders dynamically open mass gaps near the charge neutrality point.
Only on hyperbolic Dirac materials these orderings take place via quantum phase
transitions (QPTs) beyond critical interactions, which however decreases with
increasing curvature, showcasing curvature induced weak coupling QPTs. We
present scaling of these masses with the corresponding interaction strengths
and display their spatial variations.
