<h3>Tetra-penta-deca-hexagonal-graphene (TPDH-graphene) hydrogenation  patterns: dynamics and electronic structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05328</a>

The advent of graphene has renewed the interest in other 2D carbon-based
materials. Bhattacharya and Jana have proposed a new carbon allotrope, composed
of different polygonal carbon rings containing 4, 5, 6, and 10 atoms, named
Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexagonal-graphene (TPDH-graphene). This unusual topology
created material with interesting mechanical, electronic, and optical
properties and several potential applications, including UV protection. Like
other 2D carbon structures, chemical functionalizations can be used to tune
their TPDH-graphene properties. In this work, we investigated the hydrogenation
dynamics of TPDH-graphene and its effects on its electronic structure,
combining DFT and fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Our
results show that H atoms are mainly incorporated on tetragonal ring sites (up
to 80% at 300 K), leading to the appearance of well-delimited pentagonal carbon
stripes. The electronic structure of the hydrogenated structures shows the
formation of narrow bandgaps with the presence of Dirac cone-like structures,
indicative of anisotropic transport properties.

<h3>Collective excitations of the Chern-insulator states in commensurate  double moiré superlattices of twisted bilayer graphene on hexagonal boron  nitride</h3>

We study the collective excitation modes of the Chern insulator states in
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride
(TBG/BN) at odd integer fillings ($\nu$) of the flat bands. For the $1 \times
1$ commensurate double moir\'{e} superlattices in TBG/BN at three twist angles
($\theta'$) between BN and graphene, self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations
show that the electron-electron interaction and the broken $C_{2z}$ symmetry
lead to the Chern-insulator ground states with valley-spin flavor polarized HF
bands at odd $\nu$. In the active-band approximation, the HF bands in the same
flavor of TBG/BN are much more separated than those of the pristine TBG with
TBG/BN having a larger intra-flavor band gap so that the energies of the lowest
intra-flavor exciton modes of TBG/BN computed within the time-dependent HF
method are much higher than those of TBG and reach about 20 meV, and the
exciton wavefunctions of TBG/BN become less localized than those of TBG. The
inter-flavor valley-wave modes in TBG/BN have excitation energies higher than
2.5 meV which is also much larger than that of TBG, while the spin-wave modes
all have zero excitation gap. In contrast to TBG with particle-hole symmetric
excitation modes for positive and negative $\nu$, the excitation spectrums and
gaps of TBG/BN at positive $\nu$ are rather different from those at negative
$\nu$. The quantitative behavior of the excitation spectrum of TBG/BN also
varies with $\theta'$. Full HF calculations demonstrate that more HF bands
besides the two central bands can have rather large contributions from the
single-particle flat-band states, then the lowest exciton modes that determine
the optical properties of the Chern insulator states in TBG/BN are generally
the ones between the remote and flat-like bands, while the valley-wave modes
have similar energies as those in the active-band approximation.

Phase transitions and collective dynamics of active colloidal suspensions are
fascinating topics in soft matter physics, particularly for out-of-equilibrium
systems, which can lead to rich rheological behaviours in the presence of
steady shear flow. In this article, the role of self-propulsion in the
rheological response of a dense colloidal suspension is investigated by using
particle-resolved simulations. First, the interplay between activity and shear
in the solid to the liquid transition of the suspension is analysed. While both
self-propulsion and shear destroy order and melt the system by themselves above
their critical values, self-propulsion lowers the stress barrier that needs to
be overcome during the transition. Once the suspension reaches a
non-equilibrium steady state the rheological response is analysed. While
passive suspensions show a solid-like behaviour, turning on particle motility
fluidises the system and, at low self-propulsion, the suspension behaves as a
shear-thinning fluid. Increasing the self-propulsion of the colloids induces a
transition from a shear-thinning to a shear-thickening behaviour, which we
attribute to clustering in the suspensions induced by motility. This
interesting phenomenon of motility-induced shear thickening (MIST) can be used
to tailor the rheological response of colloidal suspensions.

<h3>Spin and current transport in the robust half-metallic magnet $c$-CoFeGe</h3>

Spintronics is an emerging form of electronics based on the electrons' spin
degree of freedom for which materials with robust half-metallic ferromagnet
(HMF) character are very attractive. Here we determine the structural
stability, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of the half-Heusler
(hH) compound CoFeGe, in particular also in its cubic form. The
first-principles calculations suggest that the electronic structure is robust
with 100 \% spin polarization at the Fermi level under hydrostatic pressure and
uni-axial strain. Both the longitudinal and Hall current polarization are
calculated and the longitudinal current polarization ($P_{L}$) is found to be
$>99\%$ and extremely robust under uniform pressure and uni-axial strain. The
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and Spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of hH cubic
CoFeGe (\textit{c}-CoFeGe) are found to be $\sim -100$ S/cm and $\sim
39~\hbar/e$ S/cm, respectively. Moreover, the Curie temperature of the alloy is
calculated to be $\sim$524 K with a 3 $\mu_{B}$ magnetic moment. Lastly, the
calculated mechanical properties indicate that \textit{c}-CoFeGe is ductile and
mechanically stable with a bulk modulus of $\approx$ 154 GPa. Overall, this
analysis reveals that cubic CoFeGe is a robust half-metallic ferromagnet and an
interesting material for spintronic applications.

<h3>Wrapping dynamics and full uptake conditions for nonspherical active  nanoparticles</h3>

The cellular uptake of self-propelled nanoparticles (NPs) or viruses, usually
nonspherical, by cell membrane is crucial in many biological processes. In this
study, using Onsager variational principle, we obtain a general wrapping
equation for nonspherical self-propelled nanoparticles. Two analytical critical
conditions are theoretically derived, one for the continuous full uptake of
prolate particles and the other for snapthrough full wrapping of oblate
particles. They capture considerably well the full uptake critical boundaries
in the phase diagrams constructed in terms of active force, aspect ratio,
adhesion energy density, and membrane tension based on numerical calculations.
It is found that enhancing activity (active force), reducing effective dynamic
viscosity, increasing adhesion energy density, and decreasing membrane tension,
can significantly improve the wrapping efficiency for the self-propelled
particles. These results elucidate some of the previous specific investigations
conclusively and may offer novel possibilities for designing an effective
active NP-based vehicle for controlled drug delivery.

<h3>Morphology and Optical Properties of Thin Cd3As2 Films of a Dirac  Semimetal Compound</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05683</a>

<br>
Using atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and wide-band (0.02-8.5 eV) spectroscopic
ellipsometry techniques we investigated morphology and optical properties of
Cd3As2 films grown by non-reactive rf magnetron sputtering on two types of
oriented crystalline substrates (100)p-Si and (001) alpha-Al2O3. The AFM study
revealed grainy morphology of the films due to island incorporation during the
film growth. The complex dielectric function spectra of the annealed
Cd3As2/Al2O3 films manifest pronounced interband optical transitions at 1.2 and
3.0 eV, in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations for the body
centered tetragonal Cd3As2 crystal structure. We discovered that due to
electronic excitations to the Cd(s) conical bands the low-energy absorption
edge of the annealed Cd3As2 films reveals linear dependence. We found that for
the annealed Cd3As2 films the Cd(s) conical node may be shifted in energy by
about 0.08-0.18 eV above the heavy-flat As(p) valence band, determining the
optical gap value. The as-grown Cd3As2 films exhibit the pronounced changes of
the electronic band structure due to doping effect associated with Cd
non-stoichiometry, where fine-tuning of Cd concentration may result in the
gapless electronic band structure of Dirac semimetals.

<h3>Quantum criticality under decoherence or weak measurement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05238</a>
<br>
<i>Jong Yeon Lee, Chao-Ming Jian, Cenke Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
Decoherence inevitably happens when a quantum state is exposed to its
environment, which can affect quantum critical points (QCP) in a nontrivial
way. As was pointed out in recent literature on $(1+1)d$ conformal field theory
(CFT), the effect of weak measurement can be mathematically mapped to the
problem of boundary CFT. In this work, we focus on the $(2+1)d$ QCPs, whose
boundary and defect effects have attracted enormous theoretical and numerical
interests very recently. We focus on decoherence caused by weak measurements
with and without post-selecting the measurement outcomes. Our main results are:
(1) for an O(N) Wilson-Fisher QCP under weak measurement with post-selection,
an observer would in general observe two different types of boundary/defect
criticality with very different behaviors from the well-known Wilson-Fisher
fixed points; in particular, it is possible to observe the recently proposed
exotic "extraordinary-log" correlation. (2) An extra quantum phase transition
can be driven by decoherence, if we consider quantities nonlinear with the
decohered density matrix, such as the Renyi entropy. We demonstrate the
connection between this transition to the information-theoretic transition
driven by an error in the toric code model. (3) When there is no
post-selection, though correlation functions between local operators remain the
same as the undecohered pure state, nonlocal operators such as the "disorder
operator" would have qualitatively distinct behaviors; and we also show that
the decoherence can lead to confinement.

<h3>Spectroscopic signatures of fractionalization in octupolar quantum spin  ice</h3>

Recent investigations on the dipolar-octupolar compounds Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$
and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ suggest that they may be realization of so-called
$\pi$-flux octupolar quantum spin ice ($\pi$-O-QSI), a novel three-dimensional
quantum spin liquid hosting emergent photons. Confirmation of such an exotic
phase would require the prediction of a distinctive signature and its
subsequent experimental observation. So far, however, theoretical predictions
for any such sharp smoking-gun signatures are lacking. In this Letter, we
thoroughly investigate O-QSI using an extension of gauge mean-field theory.
This framework produces a phase diagram consistent with previous studies and an
elastic neutron scattering signal with intensity-modulated rod motifs, as
reported in experiments and numerical studies. We predict that the dynamical
spin structure factor of $\pi$-O-QSI is characterized by a broad continuum with
three distinctive peaks. These three peaks, with two of them showing notably
higher intensities, should be measurable by high-resolution inelastic neutron
scattering. Such spectroscopic signatures would be clear evidence for the
realization of $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice.

<h3>Oscillations in the magnetothermal conductivity of  $\boldsymbolα$-RuCl$_3$: Evidence of transition anomalies</h3>

<br>
The 2D layered insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a candidate material for a
quantum spin-liquid state, which may be realized when a magnetic field
suppresses the antiferromagnetic order present at low temperature. Oscillations
in the field dependence of the thermal conductivity, observed for an in-plane
magnetic field $B$ up to a critical field $B^{\star}$, have been attributed to
exotic charge-neutral fermions, viewed as evidence of a quantum spin-liquid
state between the critical field $B_{c}$ $\simeq 7$ T at which the
antiferromagnetic phase ends and $B^{\star}$. Here we report measurements of
the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ as a function of magnetic field
up to 15 T applied in two distinct in-plane directions: parallel and
perpendicular to the Ru-Ru bond. We find that the number of oscillations
between $B_{c}$ and $B^{\star}$ is the same for the two field directions even
though the field interval between $B_{c}$ and $B^{\star}$ is different. In
other words, the period of the oscillations is controlled by the transition
fields $B_{c}$ and $B^{\star}$. We conclude that these are not true
oscillations -- coming from putative fermions in a spin-liquid state -- but
anomalies associated with a sequence of magnetic transitions.

<h3>Reaction-diffusive dynamics of number-conserving dissipative quantum  state preparation</h3>

The use of dissipation for the controlled creation of nontrivial quantum
many-body correlated states is of much fundamental and practical interest. What
is the result of imposing number conservation, which, in closed system, gives
rise to diffusive spreading? We investigate this question for a paradigmatic
model of a two-band system, with dissipative dynamics aiming to empty one band
and to populate the other, which had been introduced before for the dissipative
stabilization of topological states. Going beyond the mean-field treatment of
the dissipative dynamics, we demonstrate the emergence of a diffusive regime
for the particle and hole density modes at intermediate length- and
time-scales, which, interestingly, can only be excited in nonlinear response to
external fields. We also identify processes that limit the diffusive behavior
of this mode at the longest length- and time-scales. Strikingly, we find that
these processes lead to a reaction-diffusion dynamics governed by the
Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation, making the designed dark state
unstable towards a state with a finite particle and hole density.

<h3>Exact emergent higher symmetries in bosonic lattice models</h3>

While higher-form symmetries are a powerful tool in studying a quantum
many-body system, theories with exact higher-form symmetries are rather special
and, in a sense, fine-tuned. This raises an interesting question: can the
phases of a microscopic (UV) theory without exact higher-form symmetries be
exactly characterized by emergent higher-form symmetries? Here we argue the
answer is yes by constructing effective theories for bosonic lattice
Hamiltonian models that only capture the system's dynamics at $E <
E_{\text{scale}}$. The emergent symmetries below this energy scale are then
identified as the exact symmetries of this effective theory. We find that the
emergent higher-form symmetries (excluding 0-form symmetries) are robust
against local UV perturbations and become exact symmetries of the effective
theory in the thermodynamic limit. This result is true even for more general
higher symmetries, such as non-invertible higher symmetries (i.e., algebraic
higher symmetries). Therefore, emergent higher symmetries are exact emergent
symmetries: they are not UV symmetries but constrain the IR as if they were. We
apply this framework to three lattice models (the quantum clock model and
emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $U(1)$ $p$-gauge theory) to identify regions of
parameter space with energy scales below which higher-form symmetries, and
sometimes associated 't Hooft anomalies, emerge. Since phases of matter are
defined in the thermodynamic limit, this implies that a UV theory without exact
higher symmetries can have phases exactly characterized by emergent higher
symmetries. We discuss in detail the physical consequences of this and contrast
it to emergent $0$-symmetries, which are never exact. This emphasizes the
importance of identifying scale hierarchies and emergent higher symmetries when
studying quantum many-body systems.

<h3>Observation of terahertz second harmonic generation from surface states  in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the observation of second harmonic generation with high conversion
efficiency $\sim 0.005\%$ in the terahertz regime from thin films of the
topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ that exhibit the linear photogalvanic
effect, measured via time-domain terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz emission,
respectively. The features of both phenomena are found to be consistent with
the characteristics of and attributable to the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which
breaks both inversion symmetry and two-fold rotation symmetry and therefore
permits second-order processes. Since both phenomena result from processes that
reverse sign in oppositely-oriented domains of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, the observation of
both phenomena is attributable to the presence of unequally populated twinned
domains in the sample over millimeter length scales, confirmed by atomic force
microscopy measurements. These results represent the first observation of
intrinsic terahertz second harmonic generation in an equilibrium system,
unlocking the full suite of both even and odd harmonic orders in the terahertz
regime.

Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Hubbard repulsion
(U) hosts Mott insulating states. The similar crystal structure, magnetic and
electronic properties, particularly the $d$-wave gap observed in
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ enhanced the analogies to cuprate high-$T_{c}$
superconductor, La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$. The incomplete analogy was due to the lack
of broken inversion symmetry phases observed in Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$. Here, under
high pressure and high temperature conditions, we report a non-centrosymmetric
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$. The crystal structure and its noncentrosymmetric character
were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution
scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM). The magnetic
characterization confirms the Ir$^{4+}$ with $S$ = 1/2 at low temperature in
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ with magnetic ordering occurred at around 86 K, where a
larger moment is observed than the ambient pressure Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$.
Moreover, the resistivity measurement shows three-dimensional Mott
variable-range hopping existed in the system. This non-centrosymmetric
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ phase appears to be a unique material to offer further
understanding of high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity.

$\gamma$-Graphyne is the most symmetric sp2/sp1 allotrope of carbon, which
can be viewed as graphene uniformly expanded through insertion of two-carbon
acetylenic units between all the aromatic rings. To date, synthesis of bulk
$\gamma$-graphyne has remained a challenge. We here report the synthesis of
multilayer $\gamma$-graphyne through crystallization-assisted irreversible
cross-coupling polymerization. Comprehensive characterization of this new
carbon phase is described, including synchrotron X-ray diffraction, electron
diffraction, lateral force microscopy, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, and
cyclic voltammetry. Experiments indicate that $\gamma$-graphyne is a 0.48 eV
bandgap semiconductor, with a hexagonal a-axis spacing of 6.88 {\AA} and an
interlayer spacing of 3.48 {\AA}, which is consistent with theoretical
predictions. The observed crystal structure has an aperiodic sheet stacking.
The material is thermally stable up to 240 $^\circ$C but undergoes a
transformation at higher temperatures. While conventional 2D polymerizations
and reticular chemistry rely on error correction through reversibility, we
demonstrate that a periodic covalent lattice can be synthesized under purely
kinetic control. The reported methodology is scalable and inspires extension to
other allotropes of the graphyne family.

<h3>Coulomb blockade of chiral Majorana and complex fermions far from  equilibrium</h3>

We study charge transport in a single-electron transistor implemented as an
interferometer such that the Coulomb blockaded middle island contains a
circular chiral Majorana or Dirac edge mode. We concentrate on the regime of
small conductance and provide an asymptotic solution in the limit of high
transport voltage exceeding the charging energy. The solution is achieved using
an instanton-like technique. The distinctions between Majorana and Dirac cases
appears when the tunnel junctions are unequal. The main difference is in the
offset current at high voltages which can be higher up to $50\%$ in Majorana
case. It is caused by an additional particle-hole symmetry of the distribution
function in the Majorana case. There is also an eye-catching distinction
between the oscillations patterns of the current as a function of the gate
charge. We conjecture this distinction survives at lower transport voltages as
well.

<h3>A tale of the scattering lifetime and the mean free path</h3>

The idea of applying the scattering lifetime calculated from the imaginary
part of the zero temperature elastic scattering cross-section to study a hidden
self-consistent damping in two spaces of importance for non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics is proposed. It is discussed its relation with the
classical phase space from statistical mechanics and the configuration space
from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This idea is contrasted with the mean
free path values in three elastic collision regimes. The main exercise is to
study the behavior of a self-consistent probabilistic distribution function in
a space we have called the reduced phase space, since it is related to the
scattering lifetime. This exercise has been solved in two unconventional
superconductors, for which several calculations are discussed. One of them is
to obtain the scattering phase shift from the inverse strength of an atomic
potential and the other is to build several phases with different nodal
configuration of the superconducting order parameter and show that the
imaginary self-consistent part of the scattering cross-section is always
positive for two compounds: the triplet strontium ruthenate and the singlet
doped with strontium lanthanum cuprate when three models of superconducting
order parameters are used: the quasi-point, the point and the line nodal cases.
We finally compare the frequency dispersion in the anomalous skin effect with
singular shapes of the Fermi surface with the frequency dispersion in the
scattering lifetime and their respective mean free paths. This idea is useful
because it intuitively explores the nonlocality of this type of hidden
self-consistent damping for those incoherent fermionic quasiparticles.

Strontium titanate (STO), apart from being a ubiquitous substrate for
complex-oxide heterostructures, possesses a multitude of strongly-coupled
electronic and mechanical properties. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) generation
and detection offers insight into electromechanical couplings that are
sensitive to quantum paraelectricity and other structural phase transitions.
Propagating SAWs can interact with STO-based electronic nanostructures, in
particular LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). Here we report generation and
detection of SAW within LAO/STO heterointerfaces at cryogenic temperatures
($T\ge$~2 K) using superconducting interdigitated transducers (IDTs). The
temperature dependence shows an increase in the SAWs quality factor that
saturates at $T\approx 8 $ K. The effect of backgate tuning on the SAW
resonance frequency shows the possible acoustic coupling with the ferroelastic
domain wall evolution. This method of generating SAWs provides a pathway
towards dynamic tuning of ferroelastic domain structures, which are expected to
influence electronic properties of complex-oxide nanostructures. Devices which
incorporate SAWs may in turn help to elucidate the role of ferroelastic domain
structures in mediating electronic behavior.

The low-energy states of an anisotropically interacting Kitaev model on a
honeycomb lattice under triaxial strain are investigated. A numerical
calculation shows that quantized states appear in the low-energy region and
their energy is proportional to the square root of the quantum number.
Furthermore, the quantized state at zero energy appears only on one sublattice.
The obtained results are characteristic of the Landau levels of Dirac fermions
with time-reversal symmetry, indicating the emergence of the strain-induced
Landau levels of Majorana fermions, which is also determined in the anisotropic
Kitaev model by an analytical calculation.

Exceptional points are spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian systems where
eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce and responsable for unique topological
phases with not counterpart in the Hermitian realm. Here we consider a
non-Hermitian system by coupling a two-dimensional semiconductor with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling to a ferromagnet lead and show the emergence of highly
tunable exceptional points along rings in momentum space. Interestingly, these
exceptional degeneracies are the endpoints of lines formed by the eigenvalue
coalescence at finite real energy, resembling the bulk Fermi arcs commonly
defined at zero real energy. We then show that an in-plane Zeeman field
provides a way to control these exceptional degeneracies although higher values
of non-Hermiticity are required in contrast to the zero Zeeman field regime.
Furthermore, we find that the spin projections also coalescence at the
exceptional degeneracies and can acquire larger values than in the Hermitian
regime. Our results thus reveal the potential of systems with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling for realizing of non-Hermitian bulk phenomena.

We study superconductivity and surface Andreev bound states in helical
crystals. We consider the interlayer pairings along the helical hopping and
investigate the surface local density of states on the (001) and zigzag
surfaces for all the possible irreducible representations. There are three and
four irreducible representations exhibiting the zero energy peaks in the local
density of states at the (001) and zigzag surfaces of helical lattices,
respectively. By calculating the one dimensional winging number, we show that
these appearances of the zero energy peaks stem from the surface Andreev bound
states.

<h3>Self-Consistent Hopping Theory of Activated Relaxation and Diffusion of  Dilute Penetrants in Dense Crosslinked Polymer Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05353" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05353</a>
<br>
<i>Baicheng Mei, Tsai-Wei Lin, Charles E. Sing, Kenneth S. Schweizer</i>
<br>
<br>
We generalize and apply a microscopic force-level theory of the activated
dynamics of dilute spherical penetrants in glass-forming liquids to study the
influence of permanent crosslinking in polymer networks on the relaxation time
and diffusivity over a wide range of temperature and crosslink density. The
theory predicts the penetrant alpha time increases exponentially with the
crosslink fraction ($f_n$) dependent glass transition temperature, $T_g$, which
grows roughly linearly with the square root of crosslink density. Moreover, we
find that $T_g$ is also proportional to an entropic geometric confinement
parameter defined as the ratio of the penetrant diameter to the mean mesh size.
The decoupling of the ratio of the penetrant and Kuhn segment alpha relaxation
times displays a complex non-monotonic dependence on crosslink density and
temperature via the variable $T_g(f_n)/T$, but a remarkably good collapse is
predicted. The microscopic mechanism for activated penetrant relaxation is
elucidated based on the theoretically predicted crosslink fraction dependent
coupled local cage and nonlocal collective elastic barriers. A model for the
penetrant diffusion constant that combines glassy physics and entropic mesh
confinement is proposed which results in a significantly stronger suppression
of mass transport with degree of effective supercooling than predicted for the
penetrant alpha relaxation time. This represents a unique polymer network-based
type of "decoupling" of diffusion and relaxation. In contrast to the diffusion
of larger nanoparticles in high temperature rubbery polymer networks, our
analysis suggests that for the penetrants studied the mesh confinement effects
are of secondary importance in the highly supercooled regimes of interest
relative to the consequences on mass transport of crosslink-induced slowing
down of activated segmental relaxation.

<h3>Simulation Study of the Effects of Polymer Network Dynamics and Mesh  Confinement on the Diffusion and Structural Relaxation of Molecular  Penetrants</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05356" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05356</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The diffusion of small molecular penetrants through polymeric materials
represents an important fundamental problem, relevant to the design of
materials for applications such as coatings and membranes. Polymer networks
hold promise in these applications, because dramatic differences in molecular
diffusion can result from subtle changes in the network structure. In this
paper, we use molecular simulation to understand the role that crosslinked
network polymers have in governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By
considering the local, activated alpha relaxation time of the penetrant and its
long-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative importance of
glassy dynamics versus mesh confinement on penetrant diffusion. We vary several
parameters, such as the crosslinking density, temperature, and penetrant size,
to show that crosslinks primarily affect molecular diffusion through
modification of the matrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at
least partially coupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network.
This coupling is very sensitive to the local glassy dynamics of the surrounding
matrix, and we also show that penetrant transport is affected by dynamic
heterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high temperatures and
large penetrants does the effect of mesh confinement become significant, even
though penetrant diffusion empirically follows similar trends as established
models of mesh confinement-based transport.

This note revisits the semi-classical theory of quantum oscillations in

We investigate the transport properties of a quantum dot coupled to leads
interacting with a spin system using the generalized master equation within the
Coulomb blockade regime. We find that if two states for each scattering region
electron manifold are included, multiple consequences of the interacting spin
system appear in steady-state transport properties. We predict multiple peaks
in conductance, as opposed to the single peak expected in traditional Coulomb
blockade experiments, related to the inclusion of excited state transitions
between uncharged and charged electron manifolds. We find that by adjusting the
exchange coupling of the transitory electron with the spin system, these
conductance features turn on and off. This prediction opens the possibility of
using electron current to measure the exchange coupling strength between the
itinerant electron and spin system.

<h3>Image-Force Barrier Lowering for Two-Dimensional Materials: Direct  Determination and Method of Images on a Cone Manifold</h3>

<br>
<i>Sarah R. Evans, Emeric Deylgat, Edward Chen, William G. Vandenberghe</i>
<br>
<br>
The future use of two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials for
electronic device applications hinges on the ability to make low-resistance
contacts. To model such contacts, an accurate expression of the image force
barrier-lowering (IFBL) is needed. We derive the image-force energy by solving
Poisson's equation with the boundary conditions of two metal surfaces separated
by an angle omega. We show how the image-force energy can also be obtained
using the method of images provided a non-Euclidian cone-manifold space is
used. We calculate how much the IFBL is strengthened or weakened for various
omega and angles with the 2D semiconductor. For the most prominent 2D material
contact configuration, the image-force energy is reduced by a factor of 0.85,
but a smaller angle between the metal surfaces can significantly increase the
image-force energy. We predict that a contact with a small angle between the
metal and 2D material and a surrounding dielectric with low permittivity will
yield low contact resistance by enhancing IFBL.

<h3>Dynamical Signatures of Liouvillian Flat Band</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Although flat-band structures have attracted intensive studies in condensed
matter and optical physics due to their eigenstates exhibiting huge degeneracy
and allowing for the localization of wave packet, it is not clear how the flat
band of Liouvillian influences the relaxation dynamics of open quantum systems.
To this end, we study the dynamical signatures of Liouvillian flat band in the
scheme of Lindblad master equation. Considering a chain model with gain and
loss, we demonstrate three kinds of band dispersion of Liouvillian: flat bland,
dispersionless only in the real part and imaginary part, and capture their
dynamical signatures: when the rapidity spectrum of Liouvillian is flat, the
particle numbers in different sites relax to its steady state value with the
same decay rate; when the real or imaginary part of rapidity spectrum is
dispersionless, the relaxation behaviors have oscillating or forked
characteristics. We also unveil that the Liouvillian flat band can lead to
dynamical localization, which is characterized by the halt of propagation of a
local perturbation on the steady state.

Ac current-driven motions of spiral spin textures can give rise to emergent
electric fields acting on conduction electrons. This in turn leads to the
emergent electromagnetic induction effect which may realize quantum inductor
elements of micrometer size. ${\rm YMn}_{6}{\rm Sn}_{6}$ is a helimagnet with a
short helical period (2-3 nm) that shows this type of emergent inductance
beyond room temperature. To identify the optimized materials conditions for
${\rm YMn}_{6}{\rm Sn}_{6}$-type room-temperature emergent inductors, we have
investigated emergent electromagnetic inductance (EEMI) as the magnetism is
modified through systematic partial substitution of Y by Tb. By small angle
neutron scattering and inductance measurements, we have revealed that the
pinning effect on the spin-helix translational mode by Tb doping selectively
and largely suppresses the negative component of EEMI, while sustaining the
positive inductance arising from the spin tilting mode. We also find that in
addition to the spin helix, even the spin-collinear antiferromagnetic structure
can host the positive EEMI due to thermally enhanced spin fluctuations. The
present study highlights the facile control of both the magnitude and sign of
EEMI beyond room temperature, and thus suggests a route to expand the range of
emergent inductor candidate materials.

<h3>Spectroscopy Study on NV Sensors in Diamond-based High-pressure Devices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center has emerged as
a robust and versatile quantum sensor in pressurized environments. There are
two popular ways to implement NV sensing in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), which
is a conventional workhorse in the high-pressure community: create implanted NV
centers (INVs) at the diamond anvil tip or immerse NV-enriched nano-diamonds
(NDs) in the pressure medium. Nonetheless, there are limited studies on
comparing the local stress environments experienced by these sensor types as
well as their performances as pressure gauges. In this work, by probing the NV
energy levels with the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) method, we
experimentally reveal a dramatic difference in the partially reconstructed
stress tensors of INVs and NDs incorporated in the same DAC. Our measurement
results agree with computational simulations, concluding that INVs perceive a
more non-hydrostatic environment dominated by a uniaxial stress along the DAC
axis. This provides insights on the suitable choice of NV sensors for specific
purposes and the stress distribution in a DAC. We further propose some possible
methods, such as using NDs and nanopillars, to extend the maximum working
pressure of quantum sensing based on ODMR spectroscopy, since the maximum
working pressure could be restricted by non-hydrostaticity of the pressure
environment. Moreover, we explore more sensing applications of the NV center by
studying how pressure modifies different aspects of the NV system. We perform a
photoluminescence study using both INVs and NDs to determine the pressure
dependence of the zero-phonon line, which helps developing an all-optical
pressure sensing protocol with the NV center. We also characterize the
spin-lattice relaxation ($T_1$) time of INVs under pressure to lay a foundation
for robust pulsed measurements with NV centers in pressurized environments.

<br>
<br>
Sr2IrO4 and Sr3Ir2O7 form two families of spin-orbit Mott insulators with
quite different charge gaps and an antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state. This
offers a unique opportunity to study the impact of long-range magnetic order in
Mott insulators. It appears to play a different role in the two families, as
there is almost no change of the resistivity at the magnetic transition TN in
Sr2IrO4 and a large one in Sr3Ir2O7. We use angle-resolved photoemission to
study the evolution of the spectral lineshape through the magnetic transition.
We use Ru and La substitutions to tune TN and discriminate changes due to
temperature from those due to magnetic order. We evidence a shift and a
transfer of spectral weight in the gap at TN in Sr3Ir2O7, which is absent in
Sr2IrO4. We assign this behavior to a significantly larger coherent
contribution to the spectral lineshape in Sr3Ir2O7, which evolves strongly at
TN. On the contrary, the Sr2IrO4 lineshape is dominated by the incoherent part,
which is insensitive to TN. We compare these findings to theoretical expections
of the Slater vs Mott antiferromagnetism within Dynamical Mean Field Theory.

<br>
<br>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a quantum coherent transport phenomenon
that conventionally vanishes at elevated temperatures because of thermal
dephasing. Therefore, it is puzzling that the AHE can survive in heavy metal
(HM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator (AFMI) heterostructures at high
temperatures yet disappears at low temperatures. In this paper, we report that
an unconventional high-temperature AHE in HM/AFMI is observed only around the
N\'eel temperature of AFM, with large anomalous Hall resistivity up to 40
n$\Omega$ cm. This mechanism is attributed to the emergence of a noncollinear
AFM spin texture with a non-zero net topological charge. Atomistic spin
dynamics simulation shows that such a unique spin texture can be stabilized by
the subtle interplay among the collinear AFM exchange coupling, interfacial
Dyzaloshinski-Moriya interaction, thermal fluctuation, and bias magnetic field.

Manganite thin films are promising candidates for studying the strongly
correlated electron systems. Understanding the growth-and morphology-driven
changes in the physical properties of manganite thin films is vital for their
applications in oxitronics. This work reports the morphological, structural,
and electrical transport properties of nanostructured Nd0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (NSMO)
thin films fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition technique. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of the thin films revealed two prominent
surface morphologies: a granular and a unique crossed-nano-rod-type morphology.
From X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis, we
found that the observed nanostructures resulted from altered growth modes
occurring on the terraced substrate surface. Furthermore, investigations on the
electrical-transport properties of thin films revealed that the films with
crossed-nano-rod type morphology showed a sharp resistive transition near the
metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). An enhanced temperature coefficient of
resistance (TCR) of up to one order of magnitude was also observed compared to
the films with granular morphology. Such enhancement in TCR % by tuning the
morphology makes these thin films promising candidates for developing
oxide-based temperature sensors and detectors.

Patchy particles have received great attention due to their ability to
develop directional and selective interactions and serve as building units for
the self-assembly of innovative colloidal molecules and crystalline structures.
Although synthesizing particles with multiple dissimilar patches is still
highly challenging and lacks efficient methods, these building blocks would
open paths towards a broader range of ordered materials with inherent
properties. Herein, we describe a new approach to pattern functional DNA
patches at the surface of particles, by the use of colloidal stamps. DNA inks
are transferred only at the contact zones between the target particles and the
stamps thanks to selective strand-displacement reactions. The produced
DNA-patchy particles are ideal candidates to act as advanced precision/designer
building blocks to self-assemble the next generation of colloidal materials.

An analytical model of second-sound resonators with open-cavity is presented
and validated against simulations and experiments in superfluid helium using a
new design of resonators reaching unprecedented resolution. The model accounts
for diffraction, geometrical misalignments and flow through the cavity. It is
validated against simulations and experiments using cavities of aspect ratio of
the order of unity operated up to their 20$^{th}$ resonance in superfluid
helium. An important result is that resonators can be optimized to selectively
sense the quantum vortex density carried by the throughflow -- as customarily
done in the literature -- or alternatively to sense the mean velocity of this
throughflow. Two velocity probing methods are proposed, one taking advantage of
geometrical misalignements between the tweezers plates, and another one by
driving the resonator non-linearly, beyond a threshold entailing the
self-sustainment of a vortex tangle within the cavity.After reviewing several
methods, a new mathematical treatment of the resonant signal is proposed, to
properly separate the quantum vorticity from the parasitic signals arising for
instance from temperature and pressure drift. This so-called \emph{elliptic
method} consists in a geometrical projection of the resonance in the inverse
complex plane. Its strength is illustrated over a broad range of operating
conditions.The resonator model and the elliptic method are applied to
characterize a new design of second-sound resonator of high resolution thanks
to miniaturization and design optimization. When immersed in a superfluid flow,
these so-called \emph{ second-sound tweezers} provide time-space resolved
information like classical local probes in turbulence, here down to
sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond scales. The principle, design and
micro-fabrication of second sound tweezers are detailed, as well as their
potential for the exploration of quantum turbulence

Bismuth (Bi) having a large atomic number is characterized by the strong
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and is a parent compound of many 3D topological
insulators (TIs). The ultrathin Bi films are supposed to be 2D TIs possessing
the nontrivial topology, which opens the possibility of developing new
efficient technologies in the field of spintronics. Here we aimed at studying
the dielectric function properties of ultrathin Bi/FeNi periodic structures
using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The [Bi(d)-FeNi(1.8 nm)]N GMR-type structures
were grown by rf sputtering deposition on Sitall-glass (TiO2) substrates. The
ellipsometric angles Psi(omega) and Delta(omega) were measured for the grown
series (d=0.6,1.4,2.0,2.5 nm, N=16) of the multilayered film samples at room
temperature for four angles of incidence of 60, 65, 70, and 75 degrees in a
wide photon energy range of 0.5-6.5 eV. The measured ellipsometric angles,
Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), were simulated in the framework of the
corresponding multilayer model. The complex (pseudo)dielectric function spectra
of the Bi layer were extracted. The GMR effects relevant for the studied
Bi-FeNi MLF systems are estimated from the optical conductivity zero-limit
(optical GMR effect). The obtained results demonstrate that the Bi layer
possesses the surface metallic conductivity induced by the SOC effects, which
is strongly enhanced on vanishing the semimetallic-like phase contribution on
decreasing the layer thickness, indicating its nontrivial 2D topology
properties.

Crystal orientation and strain mapping of an individual curved and
asymmetrical core-shell hetero-nanowire is performed based on transmission
electron microscopy. It relies on a comprehensive analysis of scanning nanobeam
electron diffraction data obtained for 1.3 nm electron probe size. The proposed
approach handles also the problem of appearing twinning defects on diffraction
patterns and allows for investigation of materials with high defect densities.
On the basis of the experimental maps and their comparison to finite element
simulations, a hidden core-shell geometry and full three-dimensional strain
distribution within the curved core-shell nanowire are obtained. As effect, a
low-dose quasi-tomography data using only single zone axis diffraction
experiment is received. Our approach is applicable also for electron beam
sensitive materials for which performing conventional tomography is a difficult
task.

It was recently shown that the optical excitation of rare-earth ions produces
a local change of the host matrix shape, attributed to a change of the
rare-earth ion's electronic orbital geometry. In this work we investigate the
consequences of this piezo-orbital backaction and show from a macroscopic model
how it yields a disregarded ion-ion interaction mediated by mechanical strain.
This interaction scales as $1/r^3$, similarly to the other archetypal ion-ion
interactions, namely electric and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. We
quantitatively assess and compare the magnitude of these three interactions
from the angle of the instantaneous spectral diffusion mechanism, and reexamine
the scientific literature in a range of rare-earth doped systems in the light
of this generally underestimated contribution.

The highly-frustrated rare-earth based magnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ is a promising
candidate in the search for proximate spin liquid physics. We present a
thorough investigation on single crystals of this material using bulk and

plateau for three different investigated field directions. The magnetic phase
diagram is mapped out from calorimetric data and exhibits several domes of
magnetic order below 0.3 K. Propagation vectors for all ordered phases are

<br>
<br>
Inverse Ising inference allows pairwise interactions of complex binary
systems to be reconstructed from empirical correlations. Typical estimators
used for this inference, such as Pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM), are
biased. Using the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model as a benchmark, we show
that these biases are large in critical regimes close to phase boundaries, and
may alter the qualitative interpretation of the inferred model. In particular,
we show that the small-sample bias causes models inferred through PLM to appear
closer-to-criticality than one would expect from the data. Data-driven methods
to correct this bias are explored and applied to a functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset from neuroscience. Our results indicate that
additional care should be taken when attributing criticality to real-world
datasets.

<h3>Transitions in vortex skyrmion structures in superfluid $^3$He-A driven  by an analogue of the zero-charge effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
In quantum electrodynamics, the zero-charge effect originates from the
logarithmic dependence of the coupling constant in the action of the
electromagnetic field on the ratio of the ultraviolet and infrared energy
cutoffs. An analogue of this effect in Weyl superfluid $^3$He-A is the
logarithmic divergence of the bending energy of the orbital anisotropy axis at
low temperatures, where temperature plays the role of the infrared cutoff and
the vector of the orbital anisotropy plays the role of the vector potential of
the synthetic electromagnetic field for Weyl fermions. We calculate numerically
the spatial distribution of the order parameter in rotating $^3$He-A as a
function of temperature. At temperatures close to the superfluid transition, we
observe formation of vortex skyrmions known as the double-quantum vortex and
the vortex sheet. These structures include alternating circular and hyperbolic
merons as a bound pair or a chain, respectively. As temperature lowers towards
absolute zero, we find a continuous transition in the vortex structures towards
a state where the vorticity is distributed in thin tubes around the circular
merons. For the vortex sheet, we present a phase diagram of the transition in
the temperature - angular velocity plane and calculations of the nuclear
magnetic resonance response.

The topological classification of electronic band structures is based on
symmetry properties of Bloch eigenstates of single-particle Hamiltonians. In
parallel, topological field theory has opened the doors to the formulation and
characterization of non-trivial phases of matter driven by strong
electron-electron interaction. Even though important examples of topological
Mott insulators have been constructed, the relevance of the underlying
non-interacting band topology to the physics of the Mott phase has remained
unexplored. Here, we show that the momentum structure of the Green's function
zeros defining the "Luttinger surface" provides a precise topological
characterization of the Mott phase surprisingly related to the one of the
single-particle electronic dispersion. Considerations on the zeros lead to the
prediction of new phenomena: a topological Mott insulator with an inverted gap
for the bulk zeros must possess gapless zeros at the boundary, which behave as
a form of "topological antimatter" annihilating conventional edge states.
Placing band and Mott topological insulators in contact produces distinctive
observable signatures at the interface, revealing the otherwise
spectroscopically elusive Green's function zeros.

The exchange-correlation hole and potential of the homogeneous electron gas
have been investigated within the random-phase approximation, employing the
plasmon-pole approximation for the linear density response function. The
angular dependence as well as the time dependence of the exchange-correlation
hole are illustrated for a Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s=4$ (atomic unit). It is
found that there is a substantial cancellation between exchange and correlation
potentials in space and time, analogous to the cancellation of exchange and
correlation self-energies. Analysis of the sum rule explains why it is more
advantageous to use a non-interacting Green function than a renormalized one
when calculating the response function within the random-phase approximation
and consequently the self-energy within the well-established $GW$
approximation. The present study provides a starting point for more accurate
and comprehensive calculations of the exchange-correlation hole and potential
of the electron gas with the aim of constructing a model based on the local
density approximation as in density functional theory.

Magnon transistors that can effectively regulate magnon transport by an
electric field are desired for magnonics which aims to provide a Joule-heating
free alternative to the conventional electronics owing to the electric
neutrality of magnons (the key carriers of spin-angular momenta in the
magnonics). However, also due to their electric neutrality, magnons have no
access to directly interact with an electric field and it is thus difficult to
manipulate magnon transport by voltages straightforwardly. Here, we
demonstrated a gate voltage ($V_{\rm g}$) applied on a nonmagnetic
metal/magnetic insulator (NM/MI) interface that bended the energy band of the
MI and then modulated the possibility for conduction electrons in the NM to
tunnel into the MI can consequently enhance or weaken the spin-magnon
conversion efficiency at the interface. A voltage-controlled magnon transistor
based on the magnon-mediated electric current drag (MECD) effect in a
Pt/Y$_{\rm 3}$Fe$_{\rm 5}$O$_{\rm 12}$ (YIG)/Pt sandwich was then
experimentally realized with $V_{\rm g}$ modulating the magnitude of the MECD
signal. The obtained efficiency (the change ratio between the MECD voltage at
$\pm V_{\rm g}$) reached 10%/(MV/cm) at 300 K. This prototype of magnon
transistor offers an effective scheme to control magnon transport by a gate
voltage.

Simulation results are presented on the collapse of granular columns composed
of rod-like particles. Columns can be stable and free-standing if either the
friction coefficient is large enough, or the rods long enough. Destabilizing
gravitational forces are counteracted by increased frictional forces between
the rods. Different to columns made of spherical particles this is possible,
because rod contacts can slide along the rod axes to generate the necessary
"frictional cohesion".

<h3>Relaxation of imbalance in disordered XX model with on site dephasing</h3>

<br>
<br>
The relaxation of observables to their non-equilibrium steady states in a
disordered XX chain subjected to dephasing at every site has been intensely
studied in recent years. We comprehensively analyse the relaxation of staggered
magnetization, i.e., imbalance, in such a system, starting from the N\'eel
initial state. We analytically predict emergence of several timescales in the
system and extract results which match with large-system numerics without any
extra fitting parameter till a universal timescale. An often reported stretched
exponential decay is just one of the regimes which holds in a finite window of
time and is therefore in fact not a true stretched exponential decay.
Subsequently, the asymptotic decay of imbalance is governed by a power law
irrespective of the disorder. We show that this emerges from the continuum
limit of the low magnitude eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian. However, for
finite systems, due to discreteness of the spectrum, the final phase of
relaxation is governed by the relevant smallest Liouvillian gap.

One-dimensional systems comprising s-wave superconductivity with meticulously
tuned magnetism and spin-orbit coupling can realize topologically gapped
superconductors hosting Majorana edge modes whose stability is determined by
the gap's size. The ongoing quest for larger topological gaps evolved into a
material science issue. However, for atomic spin chains on superconductor
surfaces, the effect of the substrate's spin-orbit coupling on the system's
topological gap size is largely unexplored. Here, we introduce an atomic layer
of the heavy metal Au on Nb(110) which combines strong spin-orbit coupling and
a large superconducting gap with a high crystallographic quality enabling the
assembly of defect-free Fe chains using a scanning tunneling microscope tip.
Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory
calculations reveal ferromagnetic coupling and ungapped YSR bands in the chain
despite of the heavy substrate. By artificially imposing a spin spiral state
our calculations indicate a minigap opening and zero-energy edge state
formation. The presented methodology paves the way towards a material screening
of heavy metal layers on elemental superconductors for ideal systems hosting
Majorana edge modes protected by large topological gaps.

<h3>RKKY interaction on curved surfaces: Different behavior of Dirac and  Schrödinger carriers as interaction mediating particles</h3>

The RKKY interaction between two impurities on a curved surface is
investigated. Practical curved sample parameters are
considered for investigating curvatures, similar to those observed
experimentally in available samples such as graphene. For this type of
two-dimensional curved systems and for two types of Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac
carriers, the RKKY interaction and local density of states (LDOS) are
calculated. Results show that the strength of the RKKY interaction on a curved
surface depends significantly on the nature of particles embedded on this
surface, indicating that the geometry has a different effect on the dynamics of
Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac carriers. While the curved surface increases the RKKY
interaction strength for Schr\"{o}dinger-type carriers in comparison with the
flat sample, RKKY interaction decreases in the curved surface for Dirac-type
particles. This can be understood regrading the effective magnetic field
experienced by the Dirac particles as a result of the curved surface. There is
also a correlation between LDOS and the RKKY interaction, which could be
explained by the effect of conducting electrons density on the exchange
interaction mediated by these carriers.

High light absorption (~15%) and strong photoluminescence (PL) emission in
monolayer (1L) transitionmetal dichalcogenide (TMD) makes it an ideal candidate
for optoelectronic applications. Competing interlayer charge (CT) and energy
transfer (ET) processes control the photocarrier relaxation pathways in TMD
heterostructures (HSs). In TMDs, long-distance ET can survive up to several
tens of nm, unlike the CT process. Our experiment shows that an efficient ET
occurs from the 1L WSe2 to 1L MoS2 with ~9 nm interlayer hBN, due to the
resonant overlapping of the high-lying excitonic states between the two TMDs,
resulting in enhanced HS MoS2 PL emission. This type of ET from the
lower-to-higher optical bandgap material has never been observed. With
increasing temperature, the ET process becomes weaker due to the increased
electron-phonon scattering, destroying the enhanced MoS2 emission. Our work
provides a new insight into the long-distance ET process and its effect on the
photocarrier relaxation pathways.

The advent of twisting-engineering in two-dimensional (2D) crystals enables
the design of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures exhibiting emergent
properties. In the case of magnets, this approach can afford artificial magnets
with tailored spin arrangements that do not exist in nature. Here, we fabricate
an artificial magnet by twisting 90 degrees two CrSBr ferromagnetic monolayers
with an easy-axis in-plane anisotropy, thus forming an "orthogonally-twisted
bilayer". The magneto-transport properties reveal multistep spin switching with
a magnetic hysteresis opening, which is absent in the pristine case. By tuning
the magnetic field, we modulate the remanent state and coercivity and select
between hysteretic and non-hysteretic magneto-resistance scenarios. This
complexity is fundamentally different from that achieved in Moir\'e
superlattices. Our results highlight the control over the magnetic properties
in vdW heterostructures, leading to a variety of field-induced phenomena and
opening a fruitful playground for creating artificial magnetic symmetries and
manipulating non-collinear magnetic textures.

The final performance of a molecular electronic device is determined by the
chemical structure of the molecular wires used in its assembly. Molecular
place-exchange was used to incorporate di-thioacetate terminated molecules into
ordered arrays of dodecanethiol capped gold nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy confirmed successful molecular replacement. Room-temperature
molecular conductance of a statistically large number of devices reveals that
conductance is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude for the di-thioacetate
terminated molecules. Density functional theory transport calculations were
performed on five different configurations of the di-thioacetate molecules
between gold electrodes, and the calculated average conductance values are in
good agreement with the conductance experimentally-observed trend. Our findings
highlight important cooperative effects of bridging neighboring gold
nanoparticles and choice of appropriate molecular wires when designing devices
for efficient transport.

We applied single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy in a
diamond anvil cell up to 36 GPa and first principles theoretical calculations
to study the molecular dissociation of solid iodine at high pressure. Unlike
previously reported, we find that the familiar Cmce molecular phase transforms
to a Cmc21 molecular structure at 16 GPa, and then to an incommensurate
dynamically disordered Fmmm(00{\gamma})s00 structure at 20 GPa, which can be
viewed as a stepwise formation of polymeric zigzag chains of three iodine atoms
following by the formation of the dynamically dissociated, incommensurately
modulated i-Fmmm phase, and the truly monatomic Immm phase at higher pressures.

Interesting emergent behavior in quantum materials arises when the
interaction of electrons with the lattice leads to partial localization and
ordering of charge at low temperatures. The triangular lattice of some
transition metal dichalcogenides additionally presents an interesting case,
where spin order is frustrated, leading to an additional complex interplay of
interactions involving spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. Here we
present a study of local symmetry breaking of the lattice structure in the
layered dichalcogenide material 1T-TaS$_{2}$ using x-ray pair-distribution
function measurements. Remarkably, we observe symmetry-breaking polaronic
distortions of the lattice structure around individual localized electrons at
temperatures well above any of the known long-range ordered phases. These
characteristic polaronic signatures remain on cooling through the spin and
charge ordered states, eventually revealing a new transition near 50 K to a
state displaying partially restored symmetry and significant inter-layer
dimerization. The order parameter associated with the observed local atomic
displacements and symmetry-allowed polaron spin structure in the ground state
suggests that charge ordering is driven by the crystallization of polarons,
rather than conventional Fermi surface nesting. Symmetry analysis shows that
the distorted structure is consistent with a breakup of the QSL phase at low
temperature, concurrent with the disappearance of domains in the charge order.

Bio-polymer networks are ubiquitous in nature and fulfil unique mechanical
and biological functionalities that sensitively rely on the mesoscopic
structure of the network. Understanding how these structures are encoded for by
the bio-macromolecular building blocks would open up a powerful means to design
novel soft materials, but remains hampered by the enormous complexity of the
network down to the molecular level. We focus on the CO2-fixating 'pyrenoid' in
eukaryotic algae as an exemplar bi-molecular network, which is composed of
rigid 'Rubisco' holoenzymes with 8 binding sites to which any of the 5 'sticker
strands' of the intrinsically disordered polypeptide (IDP) 'EPYC1' may bind. As
a consequence, a Rubisco-IDP complex has 10^8 structurally different
microstates whose expectation values depend on the concentration, sticker
binding strength, and on the force-extensiblity of the IDPs. We present a
statistical physics approach to tackle this challenge, and apply it to
self-consistently model available (i) surface plasmon resonance data on the
competitive binding of cleaved (single-sticker) EPYC1 and (ii) fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy data on the binding of full (five-sticker) EPYC1
chains. Beyond the quantitative agreement between our model and the
experiments, the model pins down the regime of binding affinities and provides
quantitative predictions on the structure of the rubisco-EPYC1 complex. Thus,
we present a predictive model that enables the parametrisation and screening of
IDP sequences towards complex networks of associating (bio-)polymers.

Although substantial effort has been dedicated to analyzing the Higgs
(amplitude) mode in superconducting systems, there are relatively few studies
of the Higgs peak's dispersion and width, quantities which are observable in
spectroscopic measurements. These properties can be obtained from the location
of the pole of the longitudinal (Higgs) susceptibility in the lower half-plane
of complex frequency. We analyze the behavior of the Higgs mode in a 2D neutral
fermionic superfluid at $T=0$ throughout the crossover from
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) behavior.
This occurs when the dressed chemical potential $\mu$ changes sign from
positive to negative. For $\mu >0$, we find a pole in the Higgs susceptibility
in the lower half-plane of frequency and demonstrate that it leads to a
well-defined peak in spectroscopic probes. For $\mu<0$, the pole still exists,
but is "hidden," not giving rise to a peak in spectroscopic probes. Extending
this analysis to a charged superconductor, we find that the Higgs mode is
unaffected by the long-range Coulomb interaction.

<h3>Structural phase transitions in perovskite BaCeO3 revisited by data  mining-cum-first-principles theoretical approaches</h3>

Several experiments conducted over decades have revealed that the
perovskite-structured BaCeO3 goes through a series of temperature-induced
structural phase transitions. However, it has been frequently observed that the
number of phases and the sequence in which they appear as a function of
temperature differ between experiments. Insofar as neutron diffraction and
Raman spectroscopy experiments are concern, four structures are well
characterized with three transitions: Pnma to Imma [563 K] to R-3c [673 K] to
Pm-3m [1173 K]. In contrast, thermoanalytical methods showed multiple
singularities corresponding to at-least three more structural transitions at
around 830 K, 900 K, and 1030 K. In account of these conflicting experimental
findings, we computed free energy phase diagram for BaCeO3 employing crystal
structure data mining in conjunction with first principles electronic structure
and phonon lattice dynamics. A total of 34 polymorphs have been predicted, the
most stable of which follows the Glazer classification of the perovskite tilt
system. It has been predicted that the Cmcm and P4/mbm phases surpass Pnma at
666 K and 1210 K, respectively. At any temperature, two alternate tetragonal
phases (P42/nmc and I4/mcm) are also found to be 20 to 30 meV less favored than
the Pnma. While the calculated stability order of the predicted polymorphs is
in acceptable agreement with the results of neutron diffraction, the
transitions observed in thermoanalytical studies could be ascribed to the
development of four novel phases (Cmcm, P4/mbm, P42/nmc, and I4/mcm) at
intermediate temperatures. However, we analyze that the R-3c phase
predominantly stabilized over a broad temperature field, masking all subsequent
phases up until the cubic Pm-3m. Consequently, the novel phases predicted to
occur in thermoanalytical studies are only fleetingly metastable.

<h3>Nanosecond True Random Number Generation with Superparamagnetic Tunnel  Junctions -- Identification of Joule Heating and Spin-Transfer-Torque effects</h3>

This work investigates nanosecond superparamagnetic switching in 50 nm
diameter in-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Due to the small
in-plane uniaxial anisotropy, dwell times below 10 ns and auto-correlation
times down to 5 ns are measured for circular superparamagnetic tunnel junctions
(SMTJs). SMTJs exhibit probabilistic switching of the magnetic free layer,
which can be used for the generation of true random numbers. The quality of
random bitstreams, generated by our SMTJ, is evaluated with a statistical test
suite (NIST STS, sp 800-22) and shows true randomness after three XOR
operations of four random SMTJ bitstreams. A low footprint CMOS circuit is
proposed for fast and energy-efficient random number generation. We demonstrate
that the probability of a 1 or 0 can be tuned by spin-transfer-torque (STT),
while the average bit generation rate is mainly affected by the current density
via Joule heating. Although both effects are always present in MTJs, Joule
heating most often is neglected. However, with a resistance area (RA) product
of 15 $\Omega \mu$m$^2$ and current densities of the order of 1 MA/cm$^2$, an
increasing temperature at the tunneling site results in a significant increase
in the switching rate. As Joule heating and STT scale differently with current
density, device design can be optimized based on our findings.
