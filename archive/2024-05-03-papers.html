<h3>Irreversibility of mesoscopic processes with hydrodynamic interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00800</a>

</p><i>Biswajit Das, Sreekanth K Manikandan, Shuvojit Paul, Avijit Kundu, Supriya Krishnamurthy, Ayan Banerjee</i>
<p>Microscopic colloidal particles are often used as probes to study the
non-equilibrium activity of living matter or other complex systems. In many of
these contexts hydrodynamic interactions between the probe particle and the
system of interest play an important role. However little is known about what
effect such interactions could have on the overall non-equilibrium
characteristics of the system of interest. In this paper, we study two simple
models experimentally and theoretically, which demonstrate that hydrodynamic
interactions could either diminish or enhance the total entropy production of
the combined system. Importantly, we show that our method of calculating
entropy production helps identify heat flows consistently, even in the presence
of hydrodynamic interactions. The results indicate that interactions can be
finely tuned to optimize not only dynamic properties but also irreversibility
and energy dissipation, thereby opening new avenues for tailored control and
design of driven mesoscale systems.

<h3>Non-perturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multi-flavor  Schwinger Model</h3>

<p>Gauge-field configurations with non-trivial topology have profound
consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over
time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field
configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons.
Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of
fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such
fractons is usually restricted to semi-classical argumentation. Here, we show
that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the
multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example.
Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton
signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are
implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds
light on how the non-trivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging
non-perturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in
table-top experiments.

<h3>Topological Corner Modes by Composite Wannier States in Glide-Symmetric  Photonic Crystal</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00759</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhenzhen Liu, Xiaoxi Zhou, Guochao Wei, Lei Gao, Bo hou, Jun-Jun Xiao</i>
<p>Second-order topological insulators can be characterized by their bulk
polarization, which is believed to be intrinsically connected to the center of
the Wannier function. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of
second-order topological insulators that feature a pair of partially degenerate
photonic bands. These arise from the nonsymmorphic glide symmetry in an
all-dielectric photonic crystal. The center of the maximally localized Wannier
function (MLWF) is consistently located at the origin but is not equivalent
with respect to the sum of constituent polarizations. As a result, topological
corner modes can be identified by the distinctly hybridized MLWFs that truncate
at the sample boundary. Through full-wave numerical simulations paired with
microwave experiments, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and
characterized. These topological corner states exhibit notably unique modal
symmetries, which are made possible by the inversion of the Wannier bands. Our
results provide an alternative approach to explore higher-order topological
physics with significant potential for applications in integrated and quantum
photonics.

<h3>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer  graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</a>
<br>
</p><i>Leonardo Coello Escalante, David T. Limmer</i>
<p>Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how
electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer
graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist
angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we
investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the
electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show
that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function
of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the
Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of
twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes
the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as
the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited
state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects
allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a
function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of
experimental observations.

<h3>Quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes in many-body scar models</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00785</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jie Ren, Yu-Peng Wang, Chen Fang</i>
<p>From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604
(2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of
excitations with small momenta in many-body scar models in the degenerate
limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these
modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the
symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence
the name quasi-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy
between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar
physics in the degenerate limit.

<h3>Non-uniform and anisotropic electric polarizability resulting in  pronounced local repulsion minima in high-temperature superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00787</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nassim Derriche, George Sawatzky</i>
<p>We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric
polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of
the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space
semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the
cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily
concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond
polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$
atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole
Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the
in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond
direction. This is in accordance with the pseudogap phase anisotropy and the
short coherence length observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.

<h3>Density and geometry of excitations in supercooled liquids up to the  activation energy</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00788" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00788</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wencheng Ji, Massimo Pica Ciamarra, Matthieu Wyart</i>
<p>We introduce an algorithm to uncover the activated particle rearrangements,
or excitations, regulating structural relaxation in glasses at much higher
energies than previously achieved. We use it to investigate the density and
geometric properties of excitations in a model system. We find that the density
of excitations behaves as a shifted power-law, and confirm that this shift
accounts for the increase in the activation energy controlling the relaxation
dynamics. Remarkably, we find that excitations comprise a core whose
properties, including the displacement of the particle moving the most, scale
as a power-law of their activation energy and do not depend on temperature.
Excitations also present an outer deformation field that depends on the
material stability and, hence, on temperature. Our analysis suggests that while
excitations suppress the transition of dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field
theories, they are strongly influenced by it.

<h3>Sensing Spin Wave Excitations by Spin Defects in Few-Layer Thick  Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jingcheng Zhou, Hanyi Lu, Di Chen, Mengqi Huang, Gerald Q. Yan, Faris Al-matouq, Jiu Chang, Dziga Djugba, Zhigang Jiang, Hailong Wang, Chunhui Rita Du</i>
<p>Optically active spin defects in wide band-gap semiconductors serve as a
local sensor of multiple degrees of freedom in a variety of "hard" and "soft"
condensed matter systems. Taking advantage of the recent progress on quantum
sensing using van der Waals (vdW) quantum materials, here we report direct
measurements of spin waves excited in magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) by
boron vacancy $V_B^-$ spin defects contained in few-layer thick hexagonal boron
nitride nanoflakes. We show that the ferromagnetic resonance and parametric
spin excitations can be effectively detected by $V_B^-$ spin defects under
various experimental conditions through optically detected magnetic resonance
measurements. The off-resonant dipole interaction between YIG magnons and
$V_B^-$ spin defects is mediated by multi-magnon scattering processes, which
may find relevant applications in a range of emerging quantum sensing,
computing, and metrology technologies. Our results also highlight the
opportunities offered by quantum spin defects in layered two-dimensional vdW
materials for investigating local spin dynamic behaviors in magnetic
solid-state matters.

<h3>Localized and extended phases in square moiré patterns</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00811</a>
<br>
</p><i>Christian Madroñero, Gustavo Alexis Dominguez Castro, Rosario Paredes</i>
<p>Random defects do not constitute the unique source of electron localization
in two dimensions. Lattice quasidisorder generated from two inplane
superimposed rotated, main and secondary, square lattices, namely monolayers
where moir\'e patterns are formed, leads to a sharp localized to delocalized
single-particle transition. This is demostrated here for both, discrete and
continuum models of moir\'e patterns that arise as the twisting angle $\theta$
between main and secondary lattices is varied in the interval $[0, \pi/4]$.
Localized to delocalized transition is recognized as the moir\'e patterns
depart from being perfect square crystals to non-crystalline structures.
Extended single-particle states were found for rotation angles associated with
Pythagorean triples that produce perfectly periodic structures. Conversely,
angles not arising from such Pythagorean triples lead to non-commensurate or
quasidisordered structures, thus originating localized states. These
conclusions are drawn from a stationary analysis where the standard IPR
parameter measuring localization allowed us to detect the transition. While
both, ground state and excited states were analyzed for the discrete model,
where the secondary lattice was considered as a perturbation of the main one,
the sharp transition was tracked back for the fundamental state in the
continuous scenario where the secondary lattice is not a perturbation any more.

<h3>Chaotic behavior in Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonard models of  biodiversity</h3>

<p>Quantification of chaos is a challenging issue in complex dynamical systems.
In this paper, we discuss the chaotic properties of generalized Lotka-Volterra
and May-Leonard models of biodiversity, via the Hamming distance density. We
identified chaotic behavior for different scenarios via the specific features
of the Hamming distance and the method of q-exponential fitting. We also
investigated the spatial autocorrelation length to find the corresponding
characteristic length in terms of the number of species in each system. In
particular, the results concerning the characteristic length are in good
accordance with the study of the chaotic behavior implemented in this work.

<h3>Magnetic field expulsion in optically driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00848" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00848</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sebastian Fava, Giovanni De Vecchi, Gregor Jotzu, Michele Buzzi, Thomas Gebert, Yiran Liu, Bernhard Keimer, Andrea Cavalleri</i>
<p>Coherent optical driving in quantum solids is emerging as a new research
frontier, with many demonstrations of exotic non-equilibrium quantum phases.
These are based on engineered band structures, and on stimulated nonlinear
interactions between driven modes. Enhanced functionalities like
ferroelectricity, magnetism and superconductivity have been reported in these
non-equilibrium settings. In high-Tc cuprates, coherent driving of certain
phonon modes induces a transient state with superconducting-like optical
properties, observed far above T$_c$ and throughout the pseudogap phase.
Questions remain not only on the microscopic nature of this phenomenon, but
also on the macroscopic properties of these transient states, beyond the
documented optical conductivities. Crucially, it is not clear if driven
cuprates exhibit Meissner-like diamagnetism. Here, the time-dependent
magnetic-field amplitude surrounding a driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$ sample is
probed by measuring Faraday rotation in a GaP layer adjacent to the
superconductor. For the same driving conditions that result in
superconducting-like optical properties, an enhancement of magnetic field at
the edge of the sample is detected, indicative of induced diamagnetism. The
dynamical field expulsion measured after pumping is comparable in size to the
one expected in an equilibrium type II superconductor of similar shape and size
with a volume susceptibility $\chi_v$ of order -0.3. Crucially, this value is
incompatible with a photo-induced increase in mobility without
superconductivity. Rather, it underscores the notion of a pseudogap phase in
which incipient superconducting correlations are enhanced or synchronized by
the optical drive.

<h3>Effects of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and dipole-dipole  interactions on spin waves in finite-length ferromagnetic chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00862</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bushra Hussain, Michael Cottam</i>
<p>A spin-wave theory that includes the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
exchange interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions is presented
for finite-length ferromagnetic spin chains. It is found that three different
physical situations arise, depending on the direction chosen in this geometry
for the axial vector of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In some cases
this leads to a tilting of the equilibrium orientations near the ends of the
chain due to interfacial effects and with consequential effects on the spectrum
of discrete dipole-exchange spin waves. When variations are introduced for the
dominant bilinear exchange interactions at the ends of the spin chain, it is
shown that localized spin waves with spatial decay characteristics may occur.

<p>A python code (mvp.py) is presented for computing the mean-value point (MVP)
in the Brillouin zone first introduced by Baldereschi [1]. The code allows
calculations of the MVP for any input crystal structure. Having MVP allows
approximating the Brillouin zone integrals of relatively smooth, periodic
functions defined in the reciprocal space by the value of the same function at
only one, mean-value, k-point. This approximation decreases computational cost
at a relatively small decrease in accuracy. The MVP coordinates for the 14
Bravais lattices are evaluated and the underlying theory is discussed.

<h3>Hundness and band renormalization in the kagome antiferromagnets Mn$_3X$</h3>

</p><i>Yingying Cao, Yuanji Xu, Yi-feng Yang</i>
<p>The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may
lead to novel exotic quantum phenomena with potential applications.
First-principles calculations are critical for guiding the experimental
discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations
cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the
antiferromagnetic kagome lattice Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge), which exhibit a large
anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near
the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal a crucial role of the
Hund's rule coupling on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and
topological properties: (1) the establishment of noncollinear antiferromagnetic
orders, (2) the weakly renormalized bands in excellent agreement with ARPES,
and (3) a sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes beyond previous expectations. Our
work provides a basis for understanding the topological properties of Mn$_3X$
and challenges previous experimental interpretations based on incorrect band
structures.

</p><i>Palash Swarnakar, M. Ghosh, B. Mahato, Partha Sarathi De, Amritendu Roy</i>
<p>Method(s) that can reliably predict phase evolution across thermodynamic
parameter space, especially in complex systems are of critical significance in
academia as well as in the manufacturing industry. In the present work, phase
stability in equimolar AlCuFeMn multi-principal-component alloy (MPCA) was
predicted using complementary first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Temperature
evolution of completely disordered, partially ordered, and completely ordered
phases was examined based on Gibbs free energy. Configurational, electronic,
vibrational, and lattice mismatch entropies were considered to compute the
Gibbs free energy of the competing phases. Additionally, elemental segregation
was studied using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The predicted results at
300K align well with room-temperature experimental observations using x-ray
diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy on a sample prepared
using commercially available pure elements. The adopted method could help in
predicting plausible phases in other MPCA systems with complex phase stability.

<h3>Evolution of Interface Magnetism in Fe/Alq3 Bilayer Structure;  Thickness-Dependent Interface Resolved Studies Under X-Ray Standing Wave</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Avinash G Khanderao, V R Reddy, Ilya Sergueev, Dileep Kumar</i>
<p>In the present work, interfacial magnetism at metal organic interface is
probed using an isotope sensitive interface resolved nuclear resonance
scattering technique which is made depth selective under x-rays standing wave
conditions. Using GIWAXS and GINRS measurements, this study evidences the
presence of symmetry-based PMA which appears at a lower thickness of Fe having
distortion in cubic symmetry and disappears at a higher thickness of Fe as its
cubic symmetry retains. The non-zero value of quadrupole splitting evidences
the strain at the interfacial region which on increasing thickness of Fe
relaxes. The diffusion of Fe is traced using XRF and NRR, deep penetration of
Fe in Alq3 layer due to soft nature of the organic film is obtained. This
thickness-dependent study enables us to understand the magnetic behavior of
buried ferromagnetic metal in the vicinity of organic molecules.

<h3>An eco-friendly passivation strategy of resveratrol for highly efficient  and antioxidative perovskite solar cells</h3>

<p>The stability of perovskite solar cells is closely related to the defects in
perovskite crystals, and there are a large number of crystal defects in the
perovskite thin films prepared by the solution method, which is not conducive
to the commercial production of PSCs. In this study, resveratrol(RES), a green
natural antioxidant abundant in knotweed and grape leaves, was introduced into
perovskite films to passivate the defect. RES achieves defect passivation by
interacting with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite films. The results show that
the quality of the perovskite film is significantly improved, and the energy
level structure of the device is optimized, and the power conversion efficiency
of the device is increased from 21.62% to 23.44%. In addition, RES can hinder
the degradation of perovskite structures by O2- and CO2- free radicals, and the
device retained 88% of its initial PCE after over 1000 hours in pure oxygen
environment. The device retains 91% of the initial PCE after more than 1000
hours at 25{\deg}C and 50+5% relative humidity. This work provides a strategy
for the use of natural and environmentally friendly additives to improve the
efficiency and stability of devices, and provides an idea for the development
of efficient, stable and environmentally friendly PSCs.

<p>Intercalation of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with Sn results in a
well-ordered 2D metallic Sn phase with a $(1\times1)$ structure at the
interface between SiC substrate and quasi-freestanding graphene. The 2D\,Sn
phase exhibits exotic electronic properties with Dirac-like and flat bands
coexisting close to the Fermi level that exhibit both Zeeman- and Rashba-type
spin splittings. Possible inter-layer interactions between the 2D\,Sn layer and
graphene that may result in emerging electronic properties remain unexplored.
We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal a
surprisingly short-lived non-equilibrium carrier distribution inside the Dirac
cone of graphene. Further, we find that the graphene $\pi$-band exhibits a
transient down-shift that we attribute to charging of the graphene layer with
holes. We interpret our results with support from density functional theory
calculations of the graphene - 2D\,Sn heterostructure that reveal a substantial
hybridization between graphene $\pi$-band and Sn $p_z$-states that opens up a
$\sim230$\,meV band gap inside the Dirac cone and delocalizes the charge
carriers over both the graphene and 2D\,Sn layers. Our results have important
implications for the design of future ultrafast optoelectronic devices that may
find applications in the fields of light harvesting and detection, as
supercapacitors, or in novel quantum computing technologies.

<h3>Optically detected magnetic resonance study of thermal effects due to  absorbing environment around nitrogen-vacancy-nanodiamond powders</h3>

<p>We implanted Fe$^+$ ions in nanodiamond (ND) powder containing negatively
charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers and studied their Raman spectra and
optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in various applied magnetic fields
with green light (532 nm) excitation. In Raman spectra, we observed a blue
shift of the NV$^-$ peak associated with the conversion of the electronic
sp$^3$ configuration to the disordered sp$^2$ one typical for the
carbon/graphite structure. In the ODMR spectra, we observed a red shift of the
resonance position caused by local heating by an absorptive environment that
recovers after annealing. To reveal the red shift mechanism in ODMR, we created
a controlled absorptive environment around ND by adding iron-based Fe$_2$O$_3$
and graphitic sp$^2$ powders to the ND suspension. This admixture caused a
substantial increase in the observed shift proportional to the applied laser
power, corresponding to an increase in the local temperature by 150-180 K. This
surprisingly large shift is absent in non-irradiated NV-ND powders, is
associated only with the modification of the local temperature by the
absorptive environment of NV-NDs and can be studied using ODMR signals of
NV$^-$.

<p>The low efficiency of conventional liquefaction technologies based on the
Joule-Thomson expansion makes liquid hydrogen currently not attractive enough
for large-scale energy-related technologies that are important for the
transition to a carbon-neutral society. Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction
has great potential to achieve higher efficiency and is therefore a crucial
enabler for affordable liquid hydrogen. Cost-effective magnetocaloric materials
with large magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in the
temperature range of 77 $\sim$ 20 K under commercially practicable magnetic
fields are the foundation for the success of magnetocaloric hydrogen
liquefaction. Heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric intermetallic compounds
generally show excellent magnetocaloric performances, but the heavy rare-earth
elements (Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) are highly critical in resources. Yttrium
and light rare-earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) are relatively abundant, but
their alloys generally show less excellent magnetocaloric properties. A dilemma
appears: higher performance or lower criticality? In this review, we study how
cryogenic temperature influences magnetocaloric performance by first reviewing
heavy rare-earth-based intermetallic compounds. Next, we look at light
rare-earth-based, "mixed" rare-earth-based, and Gd-based intermetallic
compounds with the nature of the phase transition order taken into
consideration, and summarize ways to resolve the dilemma.

<h3>Scaling of phase count in multicomponent liquids</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yicheng Qiang, Chengjie Luo, David Zwicker</i>
<p>Mixtures with many components can segregate into coexisting phases, e.g., in
biological cells and synthetic materials such as metallic glass. The
interactions between components dictate what phases form in equilibrium, but
quantifying this relationship has proven difficult. We derive scaling relations
for the number of coexisting phases in multicomponent liquids with random
interactions and compositions, which we verify numerically. Our results
indicate that interactions only need to increase logarithmically with the
number of components for the liquid to segregate into many phases. In contrast,
a stability analysis of the homogeneous state predicts a power-law scaling.
This discrepancy implies an enormous parameter regime where the number of
coexisting phases exceeds the number of unstable modes, generalizing the
nucleation and growth regime of binary mixtures to many components.

</p><i>Christoph Sürgers, Gerda Fischer, Sihao Deng, Dongmei Hu, Cong Wang</i>
<p>Mn-based nitrides with antiperovskite structures have several properties that
can be utilised for antiferromagnetic spintronics. Their magnetic properties
depend on the structural quality, composition and doping of the cubic
antiperovskite structure. Such nitride thin films are usually produced by
reactive physical vapour deposition, where the deposition rate of N can only be
controlled by the N2 gas flow. We show that the tuning of the N content can be
optimised using low temperature resistivity measurements, which serve as an
indicator of the degree of structural disorder. Several Mn3GaNx films were
prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering under different N2 gas flows. Under
optimised conditions, we obtain films that exhibit a metal-like temperature
dependence, a vanishing logarithmic increase in resistivity towards zero, the
highest resistivity ratio and a lattice contraction of 0.4 % along the growth
direction when heated above that of the N\'eel temperature in agreement with
the bulk samples.

<h3>Tomography of a single-atom-resolved detector in the presence of  shot-to-shot number fluctuations</h3>

<p>Tomography of single-particle-resolved detectors is of primary importance for
characterizing particle correlations with applications in quantum metrology,
quantum simulation and quantum computing. However, it is a non-trivial task in
practice due to the unavoidable presence of noise that affects the measurement
but does not originate from the detector. In this work, we address this problem
for a three-dimensional single-atom-resolved detector where shot-to-shot atom
number fluctuations are a central issue to perform a quantum detector
tomography. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting the parallel measurement
of counting statistics in sub-volumes of the detector, from which we evaluate
the effect of shot-to-shot fluctuations and perform a local tomography of the
detector. In addition, we illustrate the validity of our method from applying
it to Gaussian quantum states with different number statistics. Finally, we
show that the response of Micro-Channel Plate detectors is well-described from
using a binomial distribution with the detection efficiency as a single
parameter.

<p>We demonstrate reliable machine-learned tuning of quantum-dot-based
artificial Kitaev chains to Majorana sweet spots, using the covariance matrix
adaptation algorithm. We show that a loss function based on local
tunnelling-spectroscopy features of a chain with two additional sensor dots
added at its ends provides a reliable metric to navigate parameter space and
find points where crossed Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling between
neighbouring sites balance in such a way to yield near-zero-energy modes with
very high Majorana quality. We simulate tuning of two- and three-site Kitaev
chains, where the loss function is found from calculating the low-energy
spectrum of a model Hamiltonian that includes Coulomb interactions and finite
Zeeman splitting. In both cases, the algorithm consistently converges towards
high-quality sweet spots. Since tunnelling spectroscopy provides one global
metric for tuning all on-site potentials simultaneously, this presents a
promising way towards tuning longer Kitaev chains, which are required for
achieving topological protection of the Majorana modes.

<h3>Partially bonded crystals: a pathway to porosity and polymorphism</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01300</a>
<br>
</p><i>Carina Karner, Emanuela Bianchi</i>
<p>In recent years, experimental and theoretical investigations have shown that
anisotropic colloids can self-organise into ordered porous monolayers, where
the interplay of localised bonding sites, so called patches, with the
particle's shape is responsible for driving the systems away from close-packing
and towards porosity. Until now it has been assumed that patchy particles have
to be fully bonded with their neighbouring particles for crystals to form, and
that, if full bonding cannot be achieved due to the choice of patch placement,
disordered assemblies will form instead. In contrast, we show that by
deliberately displacing the patches such that full bonding is disfavored, a
different route to porous crystalline monolayers emerges, where geometric
frustration and partial bonding are pivotal in the structure formation process.
The resulting dangling bonds lead to the emergence of effectively chiral units
which then act as building blocks for energetically equivalent crystal
polymorphs.

<h3>Prediction of Room-Temperature Electric Field Reversal of Magnetization  in the Family of $A_4B_3$O$_9$ Layered Oxides</h3>

<p>The promise of a strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in a multiferroic (MF)
material is not only of fundamental interest, but also forms the basis of next
generation memory devices where the direction of magnetization can be reversed
by an external electric field. Using group-theory led first-principles
calculations, we determine the ME properties of a relatively understudied
family of layered oxides with the general formula $A_4B_3$O$_9$. We show how
the tetrahedral rotations in these oxides can lead to a variety of hitherto
unknown structural phases with different symmetries. In particular, a polar
phase in the $Cmc2_1$ space group has been identified where a weak
ferromagnetic mode arises spontaneously via a canting of the
antiferromagnetically ordered $B$-site spins. In this polar phase, the polar
mode couples to the magnetic modes through a rare $\Gamma$-point ME-MF coupling
scheme such that the net magnetization can be directly reversed by an electric
field switching of the polar mode. Moreover, in agreement with previous
experimental observations, we predict room-temperature magnetism in
$A_4B_3$O$_9$ layered oxides which is supported by our calculations of the
magnetic exchange interaction parameters, further indicating the potential of
these compounds in practical technological applications.

<p>Analyzing local structures effectively is key to unraveling the origin of
many physical phenomena. Unsupervised algorithms offer an effective way of
handling systems in which order parameters are unknown or computationally
expensive. By combining novel unsupervised algorithm (Pairwise Controlled
Manifold Approximation Projection) with atomistic potential descriptors, we
distinguish between various chemical environments with minimal computational
overhead. In particular, we apply this method to silicon and water systems. The
algorithm effectively distinguishes between solid structures and phases of
silicon, including solid and liquid phases, and accurately identifies
interstitial, monovacancy, and surface atoms in diamond structures. In the case
of water, it is capable of identifying an ice nucleus in the liquid phase,
demonstrating its applicability in nucleation studies.

</p><i>Michael Herb, Leonard Weigl, Niklas Hofman, Johannes Gradl, Jason F. Khoury, Leslie Schoop, Isabella Gierz</i>
<p>Carrier multiplication (CM), where the absorption of a single photon results
in the generation of several electron-hole pairs via impact ionization, plays a
pivotal role in the quest for enhancing the performance of solar cells beyond
the Shockley-Queisser limit. The combination of its narrow bandgap relative to
the photon energy of visible light, along with its low phonon frequencies that
hinder efficient energy dissipation into phonons, makes the topological
insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ an optimal candidate material for efficient CM. Here we
use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to trace the
number of electron-hole pairs after photoexcitation of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with
visible pump pulses at $\hbar\omega=2$ eV. We find that both the number of
electrons inside the conduction band as well as the number of holes inside the
valence band keep increasing long after the pump pulse is gone, providing
direct evidence for CM. We also analyze the transient band structure as well as
the hot carrier dynamics inside the conduction band, providing a complete
picture of the non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in photoexcited Bi$_2$Se$_3$
which can now serve as a basis for novel optoelectronic applications.

<h3>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface  Electromigration</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mikhail Khenner</i>
<p>Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological
instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear
analyzes of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal
cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to the axial current. These treatments
extend the conventional linear stability analyzes without surface
electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly
nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave)
instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude
equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a
finite time. This is a signature of a formation of an axisymmetric spike
singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire pinch-off and
separation into a disjoint segments. The scaling analysis of the amplitude
spike singularity is performed, and the time-and-electric field-dependent
dimensions of the spike are characterized. A weakly nonlinear multi-scale
analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave
instability threshold. The time-and-electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes
of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.

<h3>Nutation: separating the spin from its magnetic moment</h3>

</p><i>Anulekha De, Julius Schlegel, Akira Lentfert, Laura Scheuer, Benjamin Stadtmüller, Philipp Pirro, Georg von Freymann, Ulrich Nowak, Martin Aeschlimann</i>
<p>For nearly 90 years, precession and relaxation processes have been thought to
dominate magnetization dynamics. Only recently has it been considered that, on
short time scales, an inertia-driven magnetization dynamics should become
relevant, leading to additional nutation of the magnetization vector. Here, we
trigger magnetic nutation via a sudden excitation of a thin Ni80Fe20
(Permalloy) film with an ultrashort optical pulse, that leads to an abrupt
tilting of the effective field acting on the magnetic moments, separating the
dynamics of the magnetization from that of its angular momentum. We investigate
the resulting magnetization dynamics in the inertial regime experimentally by
the time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect. We find a characteristic
oscillation in the Kerr signal in the range of about 0.1 THz superimposed on
the precessional oscillations with GHz frequencies. By comparison with
atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that this observation
cannot be explained by the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of
motion but can be attributed to inertial contributions leading to nutation of
the magnetization vector around its angular momentum. Hence, an optical and
non-resonant excitation of inertial magnetization dynamics can trigger and
control different magnetic processes, ranging from demagnetization via nutation
to precession in a single device. These findings will have profound
implications for the understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and magnetization
switching.

<h3>High harmonic generation from electrons moving on topological spin  textures</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Atsushi Ono, Shun Okumura, Shohei Imai, Yutaka Akagi</i>
<p>High harmonic generation (HHG) is a striking phenomenon, which reflects the
ultrafast dynamics of electrons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HHG
can be used to reconstruct not only the energy band structure but also the
geometric structure characterized by the Berry curvature. Here, we numerically
investigate HHG arising from electrons coupled with a topological spin texture
in a spin scalar chiral state where time reversal symmetry is broken. In this
system, a sign change in scalar chirality alters the sign of the Berry
curvature while keeping the energy band structure unchanged, allowing us to
discuss purely geometrical effects on HHG. Notably, we found that, when the
optical frequency is significantly lower than the energy gap, the sign of
scalar chirality largely affects the longitudinal response parallel to the
optical field rather than the transverse response. Our analysis suggests that
this can be attributed to interband currents induced by the recombination of
electron-hole pairs whose real-space trajectories are modulated by the
anomalous velocity term.

<h3>Information propagation in Gaussian processes on multilayer networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01363</a>
<br>
</p><i>Giorgio Nicoletti, Daniel Maria Busiello</i>
<p>Complex systems with multiple processes evolving on different temporal scales
are naturally described by multilayer networks, where each layer represents a
different timescale. In this work, we show how the multilayer structure shapes
the generation and propagation of information between layers. We derive a
general decomposition of the multilayer probability for continuous stochastic
processes described by Fokker-Planck operators. In particular, we focus on
Gaussian processes, for which this solution can be obtained analytically. By
explicitly computing the mutual information between the layers, we derive the
fundamental principles that govern how information is propagated by the
topology of the multilayer network. In particular, we unravel how edges between
nodes in different layers affect their functional couplings. We find that
interactions from fast to slow layers alone do not generate information,
leaving the layers statistically independent even if they affect their
dynamical evolution. On the other hand, interactions from slow to fast nodes
lead to non-zero mutual information, which can then be propagated along
specific paths of interactions between layers. We employ our results to study
the interplay between information and instability, identifying the critical
layers that drive information when pushed to the edge of stability. Our work
generalizes previous results obtained in the context of discrete stochastic
processes, allowing us to understand how the multilayer nature of complex
systems affects their functional structure.

<p>Understanding and controlling the electronic properties of two-dimensional
materials is crucial for their potential applications in nano- and
optoelectronics. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS$_2$ have
garnered significant interest due to their strong light-matter interaction and
extreme sensitivity of the band structure to the presence of photogenerated
electron-hole pairs. In this study, we investigate the transient electronic
structure of monolayer WS$_2$ on a graphene substrate after resonant excitation
of the A-exciton using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We
observe a pronounced band structure renormalization including a substantial
reduction of the transient band gap that is in good quantitative agreement with
our {\it ab initio} theory that reveals the importance of both intrinsic WS$_2$
and extrinsic substrate contributions to the transient band structure of
monolayer WS$_2$. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of
band structure dynamics in two-dimensional materials but also offer valuable
insights for the development of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices
based on monolayer TMDs and their heterostructures with graphene.

<h3>On degenerate perturbation theory for the Floquet-Hilbert space</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yakov Braver, Egidijus Anisimovas</i>
<p>We consider construction of effective Hamiltonians for periodically driven
interacting systems in the case of resonant driving. The standard
high-frequency expansion is not expected to converge due to the resonant
creation of collective excitations, and one option is to resort to the
application of degenerate perturbation theory (DPT) in the extended
Floquet-Hilbert space. We propose an extension of DPT whereby the degenerate
subspace includes not only the degenerate levels of interest but rather all the
states of the system. The resulting approach, which we call extended DPT
(EDPT), is shown to resemble a high-frequency expansion, provided the
quasienergy matrix is constructed such that each $m$th diagonal block contains
energies reduced to the $m$th Floquet zone. The proposed theory is applied to a
driven Bose-Hubbard model and is shown to yield more accurate quasienergy
spectra than the conventional DPT. The computational complexity of EDPT is
intermediate between DPT and the numerically exact approach, thus providing a
practical compromise between accuracy and efficiency.

</p><i>Chih-Chun Chien, Symeon I. Mistakidis, Hossein R. Sadeghpour</i>
<p>We propose a spectroscopic probe of the breaking and localization of Cooper
pairs in an atomic Fermi superfluid interacting with a Rydberg impurity. This
is achieved by monitoring the formation of diatomic and triatomic
ultralong-range molecular species in the superfluid across the BCS - Bose
Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. The triatomic Rydberg molecule in the
BEC regime heralds the trapping of a tightly-bound Cooper pair, reminiscent of
pion capture in nuclear matter, while the breaking of a Cooper pair on the BCS
side by a diatomic Rydberg molecule is evocative of binary-star tidal
disruption by a black hole. Spectroscopy of the Fermi superfluid and Rydberg
molecules allows for an estimation of the Cooper-pair size while the Rydberg
molecule binding energies discern many-body pairing effects.

<p>Emergent magnetic phenomena at interfaces represent a frontier in materials
science, pivotal for advancing technologies in spintronics and magnetic
storage. In this letter, we utilize a suite of advanced X-ray spectroscopic and
scattering techniques to investigate emergent interfacial ferromagnetism in
oxide superlattices comprised of antiferromagnetic CaMnO3 and paramagnetic
CaRuO3. Our findings challenge prior theoretical models by demonstrating that
the ferromagnetism extends beyond the interfacial layer into multiple unit
cells of CaMnO3 and exhibits an asymmetric profile. Complementary density
functional calculations reveal that the interfacial ferromagnetism is driven by
the double exchange mechanism, facilitated by charge transfer from Ru to Mn
ions. Additionally, defect chemistry, particularly the presence of oxygen
vacancies, likely plays a crucial role in modifying the magnetic moments at the
interface, leading to the observed asymmetry between the top and bottom CaMnO3
interfacial magnetic layers. Our findings underscore the potential of
manipulating interfacial ferromagnetism through point defect engineering.

<p>Strain tuning is a powerful experimental method in probing correlated
electron systems. Here we study the strain response of the lattice dynamics and
electronic structure in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ by polarization-resolved
Raman spectroscopy. We observe an increase of the size of the direct
semiconducting band gap. Although the majority of the optical phonons show only
marginal dependence to applied strain, the frequency of the two B$_{2g}$ phonon
modes, which have quadrupolar symmetry and already anomalously soften on
cooling under zero strain, increases significantly with tensile strain along
the $a$ axis. The corresponding Gr\"uneisen parameters are unusually large in
magnitude and negative in sign. These effects are well captured by
first-principles density functional theory calculations and indicate close
proximity of Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ to a structural instability, similar to that
encountered in excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.

<p>Calculation of observables with three-dimensional projected entangled pair

to largely simplify the contraction. The proposed approach involves the usage
of the layer structure both to simplify the search for the boundary projected

matrix renormalization group contraction. We benchmark our results on the cubic

<p>Lanthanides, like erbium and dysprosium, have emerged as powerful platforms
for quantum-gas research due to their diverse properties, including a
significant large spin manifold in their absolute ground state. However,
effectively exploiting the spin richness necessitates precise manipulation of
spin populations, a challenge yet to be fully addressed in this class of atomic
species. In this work, we present an all-optical method for deterministically
controlling the spin composition of a dipolar bosonic erbium gas, based on a
clock-like transition in the telecom window at 1299 nm. The atoms can be
prepared in just a few tens of microseconds in any spin-state composition using
a sequence of Rabi-pulse pairs, selectively coupling Zeeman sublevels of the
ground state with those of the long-lived clock-like state. Finally, we
demonstrate that this transition can also be used to create spin-selective
light shifts, thus fully suppressing spin-exchange collisions. These
experimental results unlock exciting possibilities for implementing advanced
spin models in isolated, clean and fully controllable lattice systems.

<p>Odd viscosity is a property of chiral active fluids with broken time-reversal
and parity symmetries. We show that the flow of such a fluid around a rotating
axisymmetric body is exactly solvable and use this solution to determine the
orientational dynamics of surface-driven microswimmers. Swimmers with a
force-dipole moment exhibit precession around the axis of the odd viscosity. In
addition, pushers show bimodal chirotaxis, i.e., alignment parallel or
antiparallel to the axis, while pullers orbit in a plane perpendicular to it. A
chiral swimmer that itself has a broken parity symmetry can exhibit unimodal
chirotaxis and always align in the same direction.

<p>We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large
lengthscales, in a homogeneous 2D Bose gas driven isotropically on a
lengthscale much smaller than its size. Starting with an equilibrium condensed
gas, at long drive times we observe a nonthermal steady state. At increasing
lengthscales, starting from the forcing one, the steady-state momentum
distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum, with an exponent close
to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and
(ii) a spectrum intriguingly reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated
with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based
on anisotropic driving, we also reveal the qualitative picture of the
cascade-formation dynamics.
