<h3>Machine learning topological defects in confluent tissues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08166</a>

Active nematics is an emerging paradigm for characterising biological
systems. One aspect of particularly intense focus is the role active nematic
defects play in these systems, as they have been found to mediate a growing
number of biological processes. Accurately detecting and classifying these
defects in biological systems is, therefore, of vital importance to improving
our understanding of such processes. While robust methods for defect detection
exist for systems of elongated constituents, other systems, such as epithelial
layers, are not well suited to such methods. Here, we address this problem by
developing a convolutional neural network to detect and classify nematic
defects in confluent cell layers. Crucially, our method is readily
implementable on experimental images of cell layers and is specifically
designed to be suitable for cells that are not rod-shaped. We demonstrate that
our machine learning model outperforms current defect detection techniques and
that this manifests itself in our method requiring less data to accurately
capture defect properties. This could drastically improve the accuracy of
experimental data interpretation whilst also reducing costs, advancing the
study of nematic defects in biological systems.

<h3>Inertial Spinner Swarm Experiments: Spin Pumping, Entropy Oscillations  and Spin Frustration</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08223</a>

We present here an inertial active spinning swarm consisting of mixtures of
opposite handedness torque driven spinners floating on an air bed with low
damping. Depending on the relative spin sign, spinners can act as their own
anti-particles and annihilate their spins. Rotational energy can become highly
focused, with minority fraction spinners pumped to very high levels of spin
angular momentum. Spinner handedness also matters at high spinner densities but
not low densities: oscillations in the mixing spatial entropy of spinners over
time emerge if there is a net spin imbalance from collective rotations.
Geometrically confined spinners can lock themselves into frustrated spin
states.

<h3>Ca-dimers and solvent layering determine electrochemically active  species in Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$ in THF</h3>

Divalent ions, such as Mg, Ca, and Zn, are being considered as competitive,
safe, and earth-abundant alternatives to Li-ion electrochemistry. However, the
challenge remains to match electrode and electrolyte materials that stably
cycle with these new formulations, based primarily on controlling interfacial
phenomena. We explore the formation of electroactive species in the electrolyte
Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$ in THF through molecular dynamics simulation. Free-energy
analysis indicates that this electrolyte has a majority population of neutral
Ca dimers and monomers, albeit with diverse molecular conformations as revealed
by unsupervised learning techniques, but with an order of magnitude lower
concentration of possibly electroactive charged species, such as the
monocation, CaBH$_4^+$ , which we show is produced via disproportionation of
neutral Ca(BH$_4$)$_2$ complexes. Dense layering of THF molecules within 1 nm
of the electrode surface (modeled here using graphite) hinders the approach of
reducible species to within 0.6 nm and instead enhances the local concetration
of species in a narrow intermediate-density layer from 0.7-0.9 nm. A dramatic
increase in the monocation population in this intermediate layer is induced at
negative bias, supplied by local dimer disproportionation. We see no evidence
to support any functional role of fully-solvated Ca$^{2+}$ in the
electrochemical activity of this electrolyte. The consequences for performance
and alternative formulations are discussed in light of this molecular-scale
insight.

<h3>Emergent modes of collective cell organization in an Active Finite  Voronoi model</h3>

We introduce an active version of the recently proposed finite Voronoi model
of epithelial tissue. The resultant Active Finite Voronoi (AFV) model enables
the study of both confluent and non-confluent geometries and transitions
between them, in the presence of active cells. Our results indicate a rich
phase diagram which unifies the study of the route to collective motility via
unjamming with the study of motility enabled by EMT, the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition. This approach should prove useful for issues arising in both
developmental biology systems and during cancer metastasis.

<h3>Mechanical activation of reversible bonds by low amplitude high  frequencies excitations</h3>

Reversible covalent or supramolecular bonds play an important role in
materials science and in biological systems. The equilibrium between open and
closed bonds and the association rate can be controlled thermally, chemically,
by mechanical pulling, ultrasound or catalysts. In practice, these intrinsic
equilibrium methods either suffer from a limited range of tunability or may
damage the system. Here, we present a non-equilibrium strategy that exploits
the dissipative properties of the system to control and change the dynamic
properties of sacrificial and reversible networks. We show theoretically and
numerically how high-frequency mechanical oscillations of very low amplitude
can open or close bonds. This mechanism indicates how reversible bonds could
alleviate mechanical fatigue of materials especially at low temperatures where
they are fragile. In another area, it suggests that the system can be actively
modified by the application of ultrasound to induce gel-fluid transitions and
to activate or deactivate adhesion properties.

<h3>Structural disorder by octahedral tilting in inorganic halide  perovskites: New insight with Bayesian optimization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08426" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08426</a>
<br>
<i>Jingrui Li, Fang Pan, Guo-Xu Zhang, Zenghui Liu, Hua Dong, Dawei Wang, Zhuangde Jiang, Wei Ren, Zuo-Guang Ye, Milica Todorović, Patrick Rinke</i>
<br>
<br>
Structural disorder is common in metal-halide perovskites and important for
understanding the functional properties of these materials. First-principles
methods can address structure variation on the atomistic scale, but they are
often limited by the lack of structure-sampling schemes required to
characterize the disorder. In this work, structural disorder in the benchmark
inorganic halide perovskites CsPbI$_3^{}$ and CsPbBr$_3^{}$ is computationally
studied in terms of the three octahedral-tilting angles. The consequent
variation in energetics and properties are described by three-dimensional
potential-energy surfaces (PESs) and property landscapes, delivered by Bayesian
Optimization Structure Search method with integrated density-functional-theory
(DFT) calculations. The rapid convergence of the PES with about 200 DFT data
points in three-dimensional searches demonstrates the power of active learning
and strategic sampling with Bayesian optimization. Further analysis indicates
that disorder grows with increasing temperature, and reveals that the materials
band gap at finite temperatures is a statistical mean over disordered
structures.

<h3>Rotational Symmetry Protected Edge and Corner States in Abelian  topological phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08148" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08148</a>

Spatial symmetries can enrich the topological classification of interacting
quantum matter and endow systems with non-trivial strong topological invariants
(protected by internal symmetries) with additional ``weak" topological indices.
In this paper, we study the edge physics of systems with a non-trivial shift
invariant, which is protected by either a continuous $\text{U}(1)_r$ or
discrete $\text{C}_n$ rotation symmetry, along with internal $\text{U}(1)_c$
charge conservation. Specifically, we construct an interface between two
systems which have the same Chern number but are distinguished by their Wen-Zee
shift and, through analytic arguments supported by numerics, show that the
interface hosts counter-propagating gapless edge modes which cannot be gapped
by arbitrary local symmetry-preserving perturbations. Using the Chern-Simons
field theory description of two-dimensional Abelian topological orders, we then
prove sufficient conditions for continuous rotation symmetry protected gapless
edge states using two complementary approaches. One relies on the algebraic
Lagrangian sub-algebra framework for gapped boundaries while the other uses a
more physical flux insertion argument. For the case of discrete rotation
symmetries, we extend the field theory approach to show the presence of
fractional corner charges for Abelian topological orders with gappable edges,
and compute them in the case where the Abelian topological order is placed on
the two-dimensional surface of a Platonic solid. Our work paves the way for
studying the edge physics associated with spatial symmetries in symmetry
enriched topological phases.

<h3>Statistical Mechanics of Monitored Dissipative Random Circuits</h3>

Dissipation is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. We examine the
effects of dissipation on a class of monitored random circuits that exhibit a
measurement-induced entanglement phase transition. This transition has
previously been understood as an order-to-disorder transition of an effective
classical spin model. We extend this mapping to include on-site dissipation
described by the dephasing and spontaneous emission channel and study the
corresponding 2D Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-breaking
interactions. We analyze the dynamical regimes of the mutual information and
find that the joint action of monitored measurements and dissipation yields
short time, intermediate time and steady state behavior that can be understood
in terms of crossovers between different classical domain wall configurations.
The presented analysis applies to monitored open or Lindbladian quantum systems
and provides a tool to understand entanglement dynamics in realistic
dissipative settings and small achievable system sizes.

<h3>Artificial intelligence for artificial materials: moiré atom</h3>

Moir\'e engineering in atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures creates
artificial quantum materials with designer properties. We solve the many-body
problem of interacting electrons confined to a moir\'e superlattice potential
minimum (the moir\'e atom) using a 2D fermionic neural network. We show that
strong Coulomb interactions in combination with the anisotropic moir\'e
potential lead to striking ``Wigner molecule" charge density distributions
observable with scanning tunneling microscopy.

<h3>Kekulé Moiré Superlattices</h3>

Moir\'e superlattices from stacks of van der Waals materials offer an
exciting arena in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials science.
Typically, these moir\'e superlattices consist of materials with identical or
similar structures, and the long moir\'e period arises from a small twist angle
or lattice mismatch. In this article, we discuss that long moir\'e period
appears in a new moir\'e system by stacking two dissimilar van der Waals layers
with large lattice mismatch, resulting in couplings between moir\'e bands from
remote valleys in the momentum space. In this system, the first layer is
reconstructed using a $\sqrt{3}$ by $\sqrt{3}$ supercell that resembles the
Kekul\'e distortion in graphene, and such reconstruction becomes nearly
commensurate with the second layer. This Kekul\'e moir\'e superlattice is
realized in heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides and metal
phosphorus trichalcogenides such as MoTe$_2$/MnPSe$_3$. By first-principles
calculations, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic MnPSe$_3$ strongly
couples the otherwise degenerate Kramers' valleys of MoTe$_2$, resulting in
valley pseudospin textures that depend on N\'eel vector direction, stacking
geometry, and external fields. With one hole per moir\'e supercell, we predict
that the system can become a Chern insulator, of which the topology is tunable
by external fields.

<h3>Highly resolved spectral functions of two-dimensional systems with  neural quantum states</h3>

Spectral functions are central to link experimental probes to theoretical
models in condensed matter physics. However, performing exact numerical
calculations for interacting quantum matter has remained a key challenge
especially beyond one spatial dimension. In this work, we develop a versatile
and numerically exact approach using neural quantum states to obtain spectral
properties based on simulations of the dynamics of excitations initially
localized in real or momentum space. We apply this approach to compute the
dynamical structure factor in the vicinity of phase transitions of different
two-dimensional quantum Ising models, including one that describes the complex
density wave orders of Rydberg atom arrays. When combined with deep network
architectures we find that our method reliably describes dynamical structure
factors of arrays with up to $24\times24$ spins, including the diverging time
scales at critical points. Our approach is broadly applicable to interacting
quantum lattice models in two dimensions and consequently opens up a route to
compute spectral properties of correlated quantum matter in yet inaccessible
regimes.

<h3>How to measure work functions from aqueous solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08188" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08188</a>

The recent application of concepts from condensed-matter physics to
photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) of volatile, liquid-phase systems has enabled
the measurement of electronic energetics of liquids on an absolute scale.
Particularly, vertical ionization energies, VIEs, of liquid water and aqueous
solutions, both in the bulk and at associated interfaces, can now be routinely
determined. These IEs are referenced to the local vacuum level, which is the
appropriate quantity for condensed matter with associated surfaces, including
liquids. Here, we connect this newly accessible energy level to another
important surface property, namely, the solution work function, e$\Phi_{liq}$.
We lay out the prerequisites for and unique challenges of determining e$\Phi$
of aqueous solutions and liquids in general. We demonstrate - for a model
aqueous solution with a tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) surfactant solute -
that concentration-dependent work functions, associated with the surface
dipoles generated by the segregated interfacial layer of TBA$^+$ and I$^-$ions,
can be accurately measured under controlled conditions. We detail the nature of
surface potentials, uniquely tied to the nature of the flowing-liquid sample,
which must be eliminated or quantified to enable such measurements. This allows
us to refer measured spectra of aqueous solutions to the Fermi level and
quantitatively assign surfactant concentration-dependent spectral shifts to
competing work function and electronic-structure effects, the latter
determining, e.g., (electro)chemical reactivity. We describe the extension of
liquid-jet PES to quantitatively access concentration-dependent surface
descriptors that have so far been restricted to solid-phase measurements. These
studies thus mark the beginning of a new era in the characterization of the
interfacial electronic structure of aqueous solutions and liquids more
generally.

<h3>Stacking order effects on the energetic stability and electronic  properties of $n$-doped graphene/h-BN van der Waals heterostructures on  SiC(0001)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08191" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08191</a>

Heterostructures made of stacked 2D materials with different electronic
properties are studied for their potential in creating multifunctional devices.
Graphene (G) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) van der Waals (vdW) systems
have been extensively researched, including recent studies on synthesizing h-BN
on graphene/SiC(0001) templates. These studies suggest that h-BN encapsulation
could occur in addition to vdW epitaxy. This work presents theoretical research
on G/h-BN heterostructures on SiC(0001) with a carbon buffer layer. The results
show an energetic preference for h-BN encapsulation below a single layer of
graphene: G/h-BN/SiC in bilayer systems and G/h-BN/G/SiC in trilayer systems.
Electronic structure calculations reveal that the linear energy band dispersion
of graphene is maintained in bilayer systems but with Dirac points at different
energy positions due to the varied electron doping level of graphene. In
trilayer systems, the doping level of graphene also depends on the stacking
order. The electronic band structure of G/h-BN/G/SiC features two Dirac points
below the Fermi level but with different energies. Less stable systems like
G/G/h-BN/ and h-BN/G/G/SiC display parabolic bands near the Fermi level.
Additional structural characterizations were performed based on simulations of
C-1s core-level-shift (CLS) and carbon K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge
spectroscopy (XANES) to aid future experimental spectroscopy in these
graphene/h-BN vdW systems.

<h3>The rise and fall of Mott insulating gaps in YNiO$_3$ paramagnets as a  reflection of symmetry breaking and remaking</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08199</a>
<br>
<i>Oleksandr I. Malyi, Alex Zunger</i>
<br>
<br>
The YNiO$_3$ nickelate is a paradigm d-electron oxide that manifests the
intriguing temperature-mediated sequence of three phases transitions from (i)
magnetically ordered insulator to (ii) paramagnetic (PM) insulator and then to
(iii) PM metal. Such phenomena raised the question of the nature of the
association of magnetism and structural symmetry breaking with the appearance
in (i) and (ii) and disappearance in (iii) of insulating band gaps. It is
demonstrated here that first-principles mean-field-like density functional
theory (DFT), driven by molecular dynamics temperature evolution, can describe
not only the origin of the magnetically long-range ordered insulating phase
(i), but also the creation of an insulating paramagnet (ii) that lacks
spin-long-range order, and of a metallic paramagnet (iii) as temperature rises.
This approach provides the patterns of structural and magnetic symmetry
breaking at different temperatures, in parallel with band gaps obtained when
the evolving geometries are used as input to DFT electronic band structure
calculations. This disentangles the complex interplay among spin, charge and
orbital degrees of freedom. Analysis shows that the success in describing the
rise and fall of the insulating band gaps along the phase transition sequence
is enabled by allowing sufficient flexibility in describing diverse local
structural and magnetic motifs as input to DFT. This entails using sufficiently
large supercells that allow expressing structural disproportionation of
octahedra, as well as a description of PM phases as a distribution of local
magnetic moments. It appears that the historic dismissal of mean-field-like DFT
as being unable to describe such Mott-like transitions was premature, as it was
based on consideration of averaged crystallographic unit cells, a description
that washes out local symmetry-breaking motifs.

<h3>Thermally-driven phase transitions in freestanding low-buckled silicene,  germanene, and stanene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08237" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08237</a>
<br>
<i>John M. Davis, Gustavo S. Orozco-Galvan, Salvador Barraza-Lopez</i>
<br>
<br>
Low-buckled silicene, germanene, and stanene are group$-IV$ graphene
allotropes. They form a honeycomb lattice out of two interpenetrating ($A$ and
$B$) triangular sublattices that are vertically separated by a small distance
$\Delta_z$. The atomic numbers $Z$ of silicon, germanium, and tin are larger to
carbon's ($Z_C=6$), making them the first experimentally viable two-dimensional
topological insulators. Those materials have a twice-energy-degenerate
atomistic structure characterized by the buckling direction of the $B$
sublattice with respect to the $A$ sublattice [whereby the $B-$atom either
protrudes {\em above} ($\Delta_z>0$) or {\em below} ($\Delta_z<0$) the
$A-$atoms], and the consequences of that energy degeneracy on their elastic and
electronic properties have not been reported thus far. Here, we uncover {\em
ferroelastic, bistable} behavior on silicene, which turns into an {\em average}
planar structure at about 600 K. Further, the creation of electron and hole
puddles obfuscates the zero-temperature SOC induced band gaps at temperatures
as low as 200 K, which may discard silicene as a viable two-dimensional
topological insulator for room temperature applications. Germanene, on the
other hand, never undergoes a low-buckled to planar 2D transformation, becoming
amorphous at around 675 K instead, and preserving its SOC-induced bandgap
despite of band broadening. Stanene undergoes a transition onto a crystalline
3D structure at about 300 K, preserving its SOC-induced electronic band gap up
to that temperature. Unlike what is observed in silicene and germanene, stanene
readily develops a higher-coordinated structure with a high degree of
structural order. The structural phenomena is shown to have deep-reaching
consequences for the electronic and vibrational properties of those two
dimensional topological insulators.

<h3>Insulators at Fractional Fillings in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Partially  Aligned to Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08246</a>
<br>
<i>Dillon Wong, Kevin P. Nuckolls, Myungchul Oh, Ryan L. Lee, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ali Yazdani</i>
<br>
<br>
At partial fillings of its flat electronic bands, magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (MATBG) hosts a rich variety of competing correlated phases that show
sample to sample variations. Divergent phase diagrams in MATBG are often
attributed to the sublattice polarization energy scale, tuned by the degree of
alignment of the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates typically used in van
der Waals devices. Unaligned MATBG exhibits unconventional superconductivity
and correlated insulating phases, while nearly perfectly aligned MATBG/hBN
exhibits zero-field Chern insulating phases and lacks superconductivity. Here
we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to observe
gapped phases at partial fillings of the flat bands of MATBG in a new
intermediate regime of sublattice polarization, observed when MATBG is only
partially aligned ($\theta_{Gr-hBN}$ $\approx$ 1.65$^\circ$) to the underlying
hBN substrate. Under this condition, MATBG hosts not only phenomena that
naturally interpolate between the two sublattice potential limits, but also
unexpected gapped phases absent in either of these limits. At charge
neutrality, we observe an insulating phase with a small energy gap ($\Delta$ <
5 meV) likely related to weak sublattice symmetry breaking from the hBN
substrate. In addition, we observe new gapped phases near fractional fillings
$\nu$ = $\pm 1/3$ and $\nu$ = $\pm 1/6$, which have not been previously
observed in MATBG. Importantly, energy-resolved STS unambiguously identifies
these fractional filling states to be of single-particle origin, possibly a
result of the super-superlattice formed by two moir\'e superlattices. Our
observations emphasize the power of STS in distinguishing single-particle
gapped phases from many-body gapped phases in situations that could be easily
confused in electrical transport measurements.

<h3>High-$T_c$ superconductors as a New Playground for High-order Van Hove  singularities and Flat-band Physics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08247" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08247</a>
<br>
<i>Robert S. Markiewicz, Bahadur Singh, Christopher Lane, Arun Bansil</i>
<br>
<br>
Beyond the two-dimensional (2D) saddle-point Van Hove singularities (VHSs)
with logarithmic divergences in the density of states (DOS), recent studies
have identified higher-order VHSs with faster-than-logarithmic divergences that
can amplify electron correlation effects. Here we show that the cuprate high-Tc
superconductors harbor high-order VHSs in their electronic spectra and unveil a
new correlation that the cuprates with high-order VHSs display higher Tc. Our
analysis indicates that the normal and higher-order VHSs can provide a
straightforward new marker for identifying propensity of a material toward the
occurrence of correlated phases such as excitonic insulators and supermetals.
Our study opens up a new materials playground for exploring the interplay
between high-order VHSs, superconducting transition temperatures and electron
correlation effects in the cuprates and related high-Tc superconductors.

<h3>Optical conductivity of bilayer dice lattices</h3>

<i>P. O. Sukhachov, D. O. Oriekhov, E. V. Gorbar</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate optical conductivity for bilayer dice lattices whose
commensurate stackings and effective models in the vicinity of band-crossing
points were considered in our previous work (arXiv:2303.01452). The inter-band
optical conductivity reveals a rich activation behavior unique for each of the
four stackings. We found that the intermediate energy band, which corresponds
to the flat band of a single-layer dice lattice, plays a different role for
different stackings. The results for effective and tight-binding models are
found to be in qualitative agreement for some of the stackings and the reasons
for the discrepancies for others are identified. Our findings propose optical
conductivity as an effective tool to distinguish between different stackings in
bilayer dice lattices.

<h3>Automated patent extraction powers generative modeling in focused  chemical spaces</h3>

Deep generative models have emerged as an exciting avenue for inverse
molecular design, with progress coming from the interplay between training
algorithms and molecular representations. One of the key challenges in their
applicability to materials science and chemistry has been the lack of access to
sizeable training datasets with property labels. Published patents contain the
first disclosure of new materials prior to their publication in journals, and
are a vast source of scientific knowledge that has remained relatively untapped
in the field of data-driven molecular design. Because patents are filed seeking
to protect specific uses, molecules in patents can be considered to be weakly
labeled into application classes. Furthermore, patents published by the US
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are downloadable and have machine-readable
text and molecular structures. In this work, we train domain-specific
generative models using patent data sources by developing an automated pipeline
to go from USPTO patent digital files to the generation of novel candidates
with minimal human intervention. We test the approach on two in-class extracted
datasets, one in organic electronics and another in tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
We then evaluate the ability of generative models trained on these in-class
datasets on two categories of tasks (distribution learning and property
optimization), identify strengths and limitations, and suggest possible
explanations and remedies that could be used to overcome these in practice.

The amorphous solids can be theoretically modeled by anharmonic disordered
lattices. However, most of theoretical studies on thermal conductivity in
anharmonic disordered lattices only focus on the potentials of hard-type (HT)
anharmonicity. Here we study the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of
one-dimensional (1D) disordered lattices with both hard- and soft-type (ST)
anharmonic on-site potentials. It is found, via both direct molecular dynamic
simulations and theoretical method, that the anharmonicity dependence of
$\kappa$ in the HT model is nonmonotonous, while in the ST model is
monotonously increased. This provides a new way to enhance thermal conductivity
in disordered systems. Furthermore, $\kappa$ of the HT model is consistent with
the prediction of the quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo (QHGK) method in a wide range
of anharmonicity, while for the ST model, the numerical results seem largely
deviated from the theoretical predictions as the anharmonicity becomes soft.
This new and peculiar feature of the ST model may root in the fact that only
delocalization effect exists, different from the competing roles that both
delocalization and localization play in the counterpart HT model.

<h3>Universal Law of Coiling for a Short Elastic Strip Contacting Within a  Tube</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08304</a>
<br>
<i>Jeng Yi Lee, Hao-Yu Lu, Ray-Kuang Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We find that there exists a universal law of coiling not only for a long
elastic strip contacting within a tube but also for a short one. Here the
elastic strip we consider has the ratio of $2 < L/R \le 2\pi$ for its length
$L$ to the tube radius $R$. By varying the ratio of $L/R$, we identify four
types of deformation for such a short elastic strip, namely, two point-contact,
three point-contact, continuous-contact, and self-contact. With theoretical
formulas in closed forms and experimental demonstration, these four types are
verified for any elastic strips contacting within a tube, irrespective of
elastic properties, strip lengths, and tube radius. Our results on coiling can
be readily applied to a variety of physical systems, including thin flexible
electronic devices, van der Waals materials in scroll shape, and DNA packaging
into viral capsids.

Harnessing the causal relationships between mechanical and magnetic
properties of van der Waals materials presents a wealth of untapped opportunity
for scientific and technological advancement, from precision sensing to novel
memories. This can, however, only be exploited if the means exist to
efficiently interface with the magnetoelastic interaction. Here, we demonstrate
acoustically-driven spin-wave resonance in a crystalline antiferromagnet,
chromium trichloride, via surface acoustic wave irradiation. The resulting
magnon-phonon coupling is found to depend strongly on sample temperature and
external magnetic field orientation, and displays a high sensitivity to
extremely weak magnetic anisotropy fields in the few~mT range. Our work
demonstrates a natural pairing between power-efficient strain-wave technology
and the excellent mechanical properties of van der Waals materials,
representing a foothold towards widespread future adoption of dynamic
magneto-acoustics.

<h3>Characterization of local deformation around hydrides in Zircaloy-4  using conventional and high angular resolution electron backscatter  diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08311</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Zircaloy-4 is used as a fuel cladding material for water reactors, as it has
good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and a low thermal neutron
absorption cross section. However, the mechanical performance of Zircaloy-4 can
be reduced during service due to hydrogen uptake and hydride formation. These
hydrides are brittle, and often reduce the strength and toughness of materials
as well as increase susceptibility to delayed hydride cracking (DHC). In this
work, large grain Zircaloy-4 with hydrides was prepared and then cross
sectioned using cryo-ion beam polishing, using plasma focused ion beam (pFIB)
and broad ion beam (BIB) approaches to enable the preparation of a very high
quality flat surface with no preferential etching of either the hydride or
zirconium metal (typically metallographic polishing preferentially removes
hydrides). Conventional and high angular resolution electron backscatter
diffraction (EBSD) analysis were then used to explore morphology, deformation
fields, and orientation relationships between the zirconium matrix and
hydrides. Four maps were collected for analysis which included hydrides near
grain boundaries: (a) where the hydride smoothly decorates across two of the
connecting boundaries near a triple junction; (b) where the hydride smoothly
decorates the boundary; (c) a mixture of smooth decoration of the interface and
protrusion into the grains; (d) fine scale hydride that protrudes into one
grain. This work highlights that incompatibility of the hydride within the
zirconium matrix is strongly linked to the orientation relationship of the
hydride and matrix, and the grain boundary character. These results may enable
enhanced understanding of the role of hydrides in fracture as well as
stress-induced hydride reorientation and DHC susceptibility.

<h3>Magnetization Dynamics and Peierls Instability in Topological Josephson  Structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08321</a>
<br>
<i>Adrian Reich, Erez Berg, Jörg Schmalian, Alexander Shnirman</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a long topological Josephson junction with a ferromagnetic strip
between two superconductors. The low-energy theory exhibits a non-local in time
and space interaction between chiral Majorana fermions, mediated by the
magnonic excitations in the ferromagnet. While short ranged interactions turn
out to be irrelevant by power counting, we show that sufficiently strong and
long-ranged interactions may induce a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry breaking. This
spontaneous breaking leads to a tilting of the magnetization perpendicular to
the Majorana propagation direction and the opening of a fermionic gap (Majorana
mass). It is analogous to the Peierls instability in the commensurate
Fr\"ohlich model and reflects the nontrivial interplay between Majorana modes
and magnetization dynamics. Within a Gaussian fluctuation analysis, we estimate
critical values for the temporal and spatial non-locality of the interaction,
beyond which the symmetry breaking is stable at zero temperature -- despite the
effective one-dimensionality of the model. We conclude that non-locality, i.e.,
the stiffness of the magnetization in space and time, stabilizes the symmetry
breaking. In the stabilized regime, we expect the current-phase relation to
exhibit an experimentally accessible discontinuous jump. At nonzero
temperatures, as usual in the 1D Ising model, the long-range order is destroyed
by solitonic excitations, which in our case carry each a Majorana zero mode. In
order to estimate the correlation length, we investigate the solitons within a
self-consistent mean-field approach.

<h3>Stability of the novel interorbital-hopping mechanism for ferromagnetism  in multi-orbital Hubbard models</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Recently, it was argued that a ferromagnetic (FM) insulating phase can be
induced by a novel {\it interorbital} hopping mechanism. Here, we study the
stability range of this novel FM phase under modifications in the crystal
fields and electronic correlation strength, constructing a theoretical phase
diagram. A plethora of states is unveiled, including the FM Mott insulator
(MI), a FM orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP), several anferromagnetic (AFM)
MI phases, an AFM metallic state, and a FM metal as well. Our most interesting
result is that the FM regime, either in MI or OSMP forms, is shown to be stable
in {\it large} portions of the phase diagram, at both intermediate and strong
electronic correlations, respectively. Our results demonstrate via a detailed
example that the recently proposed novel mechanism to stabilize FM insulators
is not fragile but instead robust, and may enlarge substantially the relatively
small family of known FM insulators.

<h3>Maxwell's Demon for Quantum Transport</h3>

Maxwell's demon can be utilized to construct quantum information engines.
While most of the existing quantum information engines harness thermal
fluctuations, quantum information engines that utilize quantum fluctuations
have recently been discussed. We propose a new type of genuinely quantum
information engine that harnesses quantum fluctuations to achieve cumulative
storage of useful work and unidirectional transport of a particle. Our scheme
does not require thermalization, which eliminates the ambiguity in evaluating
the power and velocity of our proposed engine in contrast to other existing
quantum information engines that can transport a particle. We find a tradeoff
relationship between the maximum achievable power and the maximum velocity. We
also propose an improved definition of efficiency by clarifying all possible
energy flows involved in the engine cycle.

<h3>Broken Symmetry Effects due to Polarization on Resonant Tunneling  Transport in Double-Barrier Nitride Heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
The phenomenon of resonant tunneling transport through polar double-barrier
heterostructures is systematically investigated using a combined experimental
and theoretical approach. On the experimental side, GaN/AlN RTDs are grown by
MBE. In-situ electron diffraction is employed to monitor the number of
monolayers incorporated into each tunneling barrier. Using this precise
epitaxial control at the monolayer level, we demonstrate exponential modulation
of the resonant tunneling current as a function of barrier thickness. Both the
peak voltage and characteristic threshold bias exhibit a dependence on barrier
thickness as a result of the intense electric fields present in the polar
heterostructures. To get further insight into the asymmetric tunneling
injection, we present an analytical theory for tunneling transport across polar
heterostructures. A general expression for the resonant tunneling current with
contributions from coherent and sequential tunneling processes is introduced.
After applying this theory to the case of GaN/AlN RTDs, their experimental
current-voltage characteristics are reproduced over both bias polarities, with
tunneling currents spanning several orders of magnitude. This agreement allows
us to elucidate the role played by the internal polarization fields on the
magnitude of the tunneling current and broadening of the resonant line shape.
Under reverse bias, we identify new tunneling features originating from highly
attenuated resonant tunneling phenomena, which are completely captured by our
model. Our analytical model, provides a simple expression which reveals the
connection between the polar RTD design parameters and its current-voltage
characteristics. This new theory paves the way for the design of polar resonant
tunneling devices exhibiting efficient resonant current injection and enhanced
tunneling dynamics, as required in various practical applications.

<h3>Entangled Collective Spin States of Two Species Ultracold atoms in a  Ring</h3>

<br>
<i>Tomáš Opatrný, Kunal K. Das</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the general quantum Hamiltonian that can be realized with two
species of mutually interacting degenerate ultracold atoms in a ring-shaped
trap, with the options of rotation and an azimuthal lattice. We examine the
spectrum and the states with a collective spin picture in a Dicke state basis.
The system can generate states with a high degree of entanglement gauged by the
von Neumann entropy. The Hamiltonian has two components, a linear part that can
be controlled and switched on via rotation or the azimuthal lattice, and an
interaction-dependent quadratic part. Exact solutions are found for the
quadratic part for equal strengths of intra-species and the inter-species
interactions, but for generally different particle numbers in the two species.
The quadratic Hamiltonian has a degenerate ground state when the two species
have unequal number of particles, but non-degenerate when equal. We determine
the impact on the entanglement entropy of deviations from equal particle
numbers as well as deviations from the assumption of equal interaction
strengths. Limiting cases are shown to display features of a beam-splitter and
spin-squeezing that can find utility in interferometry. The density of states
for the full Hamiltonian shows features as of phase transition in varying
between linear and quadratic limits.

<h3>Effect of X-Ray Irradiation on Magnetocaloric Material,  (MnNiSi)1-x(Fe2Ge)x</h3>

<br>
<br>
(MnNiSi)1-(Fe2Ge)x composition (x=0.34) alloy was prepared by arc melting,
crushed, and sieved to approximately <32 microns. They were utilized in
examining the possible magnetic and structural changes when exposed to a dosage
of a continuous sweeping rate of ~>120 Gy/min and an absorbed dose of 35 kGy of
X-ray radiation. This study reports observable trends in X-ray diffraction and
magnetic measurements. Magnetization in the magnetization vs. temperature (both
heating and cooling) measurements showed an increase from 2.72 emu/g to 4.01
emu/g in the irradiated sample. The Magnetization vs. magnetic field loops
exhibited irradiation-induced magnetic hysteresis. The irradiated sample also
exhibited an observable change in its coercivity of {\Delta}Hc = 14.7% at 200
K. A maximum entropy change {\Delta}Smag of ~ 11.139 J/kg*K and a Tave peak of
317.5 K was achieved for the pristine sample in comparison to {\Delta}Smag of ~
11.349 J/kg*K and a Tave peak of 312.5 K for the irradiated sample. These
presented results provided deeper insights into tuning the effect of
irradiation to the magnetic properties of (MnNiSi)1-(Fe2Ge)x for composition
(x=0.34) that can be utilized in a wide range of magnetocaloric applications in
high-energy radiation environments. The irradiation applied to the sample did
not induce any structural or magnetic phase changes in the selected composition
but modified the magnetic properties marginally.

<h3>Coexistence of superconductivity with partially filled stripes in the  Hubbard model</h3>

<br>
<i>Hao Xu, Chia-Min Chung, Mingpu Qin, Ulrich Schollwöck, Steven R. White, Shiwei Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Combining the complementary capabilities of two of the most powerful modern
computational methods, we find superconductivity in both the electron- and
hole-doped regimes of the two-dimensional Hubbard model (with next nearest
neighbor hopping). In the electron-doped regime, superconductivity is weaker
and is accompanied by antiferromagnetic N\'eel correlations at low doping. The
strong superconductivity on the hole-doped side coexists with stripe order,
which persists into the overdoped region with weaker hole density modulation.
These stripe orders, neither filled as in the pure Hubbard model (no next
nearest neighbor hopping) nor half-filled as seen in previous state-of-the-art
calculations, vary in fillings between 0.6 and 0.8. The resolution of the tiny
energy scales separating competing orders requires exceedingly high accuracy
combined with averaging and extrapolating with a wide range of system sizes and
boundary conditions. These results validate the applicability of this iconic
model for describing cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

<br>
PdCrO$_2$ films are synthesized on CuCrO$_2$ buffer layers on Al$_2$O$_3$
substrates. This synthesis is accompanied by impurity phase segregation, which
hampers the synthesis of high quality PdCrO$_2$ films. The potential causes of
impurity phase segregation were studied by using a combination of experiments
and ab initio calculations. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission
electron microscopy experiments revealed impurity phases of Cu$_x$Pd$_{1-x}$
alloy and chromium oxides, Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Cr$_3$O$_4$, in PdCrO$_2$.
Calculations determined that oxygen deficiency can cause the impurity phase
segregation. Therefore, preventing oxygen release from delafossites could
suppress the impurity phase segregation. The amounts of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and
Cr$_3$O$_4$ depend differently on temperature and oxygen partial pressure. A
reasonable theory-based explanation for this experimental observation is
provided.

<h3>Efficient domain wall motion driven by the out-of-plane spin  polarization</h3>

<br>
<br>
Fast domain wall motion in systems with perpendicular magnetization is
necessary for many novel applications such as the racetrack memory, domain wall
logic devices and artificial synapses. The domain wall speed has been greatly
improved after the demonstration of current driven domain wall motion using the
spin transfer torque, and later achieved another leap due to the combined
effect of spin-Hall effect and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).
However, only Neel wall can be effectively driven in the latter system. In this
paper, we show that both Bloch and Neel domain walls can be effectively moved
by exploiting the field-like torque with the out-of-plane spin polarization,
which can be generated in materials with reduced symmetry. In addition, we find
that the Neel wall and Bloch walls stabilized by the magnetostatic energy are
easily distorted by the spin-orbit torque and they then enter the Walker
breakdown region. External magnetic field and DMI are introduced to stabilize
the domain wall, and a very high domain wall velocity over 500 m/s is obtained
at a moderate current density of $2\times 10^{11} A/m^2$. In principle, this
mechanism can be used to drive any types of domain walls. This work thus
provides new degrees of freedom in the control of domain wall motion.

The resemblance between electrons and optical waves has strongly driven the
advancement of mesoscopic physics. However, electron waves have yet to be
understood in open cavity structures which have provided contemporary optics
with rich insight towards non-Hermitian systems and complex interactions
between resonance mode. Here, we report the realization of an open cavity
resonator in a two-dimensional electronic system. We studied the resonant
electron modes within the cavity and resolved the signatures of longitudinal
and transverse quantization, showing that the modes are robust despite the
openness of the cavity being highly open to the background continuum. The
transverse modes were investigated by applying a controlled deformation to the
cavity, and their spatial distributions were further analyzed using
magnetoconductance measurements and numerical simulation. These results lay the
groundwork to exploring electronic wavefunctions in the context of modern
optical systems, such as the dielectric microcavity.

Heat conduction equation on a lattice composed of nodes and bonds is
formulated assuming the Fourier law and the energy conservation law. Based on
this equation, we propose a higher-order topological heat conduction model on
the breathing kagome lattice. We show that the temperature measurement at a
conner node can detect the corner state which causes rapid heat conduction
toward the heat bath, and that several-nodes measurement can determine the
precise energy of the corner states.

Resonant tunneling transport in polar heterostructures is intimately
connected to the polarization fields emerging from the geometric Berry-phase.
In these structures, quantum confinement results not only in a discrete
electronic spectrum, but also in built-in polarization charges exhibiting a
broken inversion symmetry along the transport direction. Thus, electrons
undergo highly asymmetric quantum interference effects with respect to the
direction of current flow. By employing doping to counter the broken symmetry,
we deterministically control the resonant transmission through GaN/AlN resonant
tunneling diodes and experimentally demonstrate the recovery of symmetric
resonant tunneling injection across the noncentrosymmetric double-barrier
potential.

Magnomechanical devices, in which magnetic excitations couple to mechanical
vibrations, have been discussed as efficient and broadband microwave signal
transducers in the classical and quantum limit. We experimentally investigate
the magnetoelastic coupling between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modes in
a metallic Co$_{25}$Fe$_{75}$ thin film, featuring ultra-low magnetic damping
as well as sizable magnetostriction, and standing transverse elastic phonon
modes in sapphire, silicon and gadolinium gallium garnet by performing
broadband FMR spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. For all these substrate
materials, we observe an interaction between the resonant acoustic and magnetic
modes, which can be tailored by the propagation direction of the acoustic mode
with respect to the crystallographic axes. We identify these phonon modes as
transverse shear waves propagating with slightly different velocities with
relative magnitudes of $\Delta v/v\simeq10^{-5}$, i.e., all substrates show
phononic birefringence. Upon appropriately choosing the phononic mode, the
hybrid magnomechanical system enters the Purcell enhanced coupling regime.

<h3>Accurate determination of band tail properties in amorphous  semiconductor thin film with Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy</h3>

<br>

Amorphous oxide semiconductors are receiving significant attention due to
their relevance for large area electronics. Their disordered microscopic
structure causes the formation of band tails in the density of states (DOS)
that strongly affect charge transport properties. Bandtail properties are
crucial to understand for optimizing thin film device performance. Among the
available techniques to measure the DOS, KPFM is exceptional as it enables
precise local electronic investigations combined with microscopic imaging.
However, a model to interpret KPFM spectroscopy data on amorphous
semiconductors of finite thickness is lacking. To address this issue, we
provide an analytical solution to the Poisson's equation for a
metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junction interacting with the AFM tip. The
solution enables us to fit experimental data for semiconductors with finite
thickness and obtain the DOS parameters, such as band tail width (E_t), doping
density (N_D), and flat band potential. To demonstrate our method, we perform
KPFM experiments on Indium-Gallium-Zinc Oxide (IGZO) thin film transistors
(IGZO-TFTs). DOS parameters compare well to values obtained with photocurrent
spectroscopy. We demonstrate the potentials of the developed method by
investigating the impact of ionizing radiation on DOS parameters and TFT
performance. Our results provide clear evidence that the observed shift in
threshold voltage is caused by static charge in the gate dielectric leading to
a shift in flat band potential. Band-tails and doping density are not affected
by the radiation. The developed methodology can be easily translated to
different semiconductor materials and paves the way towards quantitative
microscopic mapping of local DOS parameters in thin film devices.

<h3>Symmetry-protected difference between spin Hall and anomalous Hall  effects of a periodically driven multiorbital metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonequilibrium quantum states can be controlled via the driving field in
periodically driven systems. Such control, which is called Floquet engineering,
has opened various phenomena, such as the light-induced anomalous Hall effect.
There are expected to be some essential differences between the anomalous Hall
and spin Hall effects of periodically driven systems because of the difference
in time-reversal symmetry. However, these differences remain unclear due to the
lack of Floquet engineering of the spin Hall effect. Here we show that when the
helicity of circularly polarized light is changed in a periodically driven
$t_{2g}$-orbital metal, the spin current generated by the spin Hall effect
remains unchanged, whereas the charge current generated by the anomalous Hall
effect is reversed. This difference is protected by the symmetry of a time
reversal operation. Our results offer a way to distinguish the spin current and
charge current via light and could be experimentally observed in pump-probe
measurements of periodically driven Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$.

SrVO3 (SVO) is a prospective candidate to replace the conventional
indium-tin-oxide (ITO) among the new transparent conducting oxide (TCO)
generation. In this study, the structural, electrical, and optical properties
of SVO thin films, both epitaxial and polycrystalline, are determined during
and after heat treatments in the 150-250 {\deg}C range and under ambient
environment in order to explore the chemical stability of this material. The
use of these relatively low temperatures speeds up the natural ageing of the
films, and allows to follow the evolution of their related properties. The
combination of techniques rather sensitive to the film surface and of
techniques sampling the film volume will emphasize the presence of a surface
oxidation evolving in time at low annealing temperatures, whereas the
perovskite phase is destroyed throughout the film for treatments above 200
{\deg}C. The present study is designed to understand the thermal degradation
and long-term stability issues of vanadate-based TCOs, and to identify
technologically viable solutions for the application of this group as new TCOs.

In this paper, two improvements to the theory of transition from brittle to

drastic temperature rise near the crack tip, the temperature dependence of the
shear modulus is included to better quantify the thermally sensitive

identified by the large scale least squares method. The comparison between the
fracture toughness predicted by the theory and the values obtained in Gumbsch's

1D chains with non-reciprocal tunneling realizing the non-Hermitian skin
effect (NHSE) have attracted considerable interest in the last years whereas
their experimental realization in real space remains limited to a few examples.
In this work, we propose a new generic way of implementing non-reciprocity
based on a combination of the Rashba-Dresshlauss spin-orbit coupling, existing
for electrons, cold atoms, and photons, and a lifetime imbalance between two
spin components. We show that one can realize the Hatano-Nelson model, the
non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and even observe the NHSE in a 1D
potential well without the need for a lattice. We further demonstrate the
practical feasibility of this proposal by considering the specific example of a
photonic liquid crystal microcavity. This platform allows one to switch on and
off the NHSE by applying an external voltage to the microcavity.

<br>
<br>
We evaluate the terahertz (THz) detectors based on field effect transistor
(FET) with the graphene channel {GC} and a floating metal gate (MG) separated
from the GC by a black-phosphorus (b-P) or black-arsenic (b-As) barrier layer
(BL). The operation of these GC-FETs is associated with the heating of the
two-dimensional electron gas in the GC by impinging THz radiation leading to
thermionic emission of the hot electrons from the GC to the MG. This results in
the variation of the floating gate potential, which affects the source-drain
current. At the THz radiation frequencies close to the plasmonic resonance
frequencies in the gated GC, the variation of the source-drain current and,
hence, the detector responsivity can be resonantly large.

<br>
<br>
We analyze the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) heating by the incident
terahertz (THz) radiation in the field-effect transistor (FET) structures with
the graphene channels (GCs) and the black-phosphorus and black-arsenic gate
barrier layers (BLs). Such GC-FETs can operate as bolometric THz detectors
using the thermionic emission of the hot electrons from the GC via the BL into
the gate. Due to the excitation of plasmonic oscillations in the GC by the THz
signals, the GC-FET detector response can be pronouncedly resonant, leading to
elevated values of the detector responsivity. The lateral thermal conductivity
of the 2DEG can markedly affect the GC-FET responsivity, in particular, its
spectral characteristics. This effect should be considered for the optimization
of the GC-FET detectors.

Understanding the mechanisms of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling within
multiferroic structures is paramount from a fundamental as well as an applied
point of view. We report here that the magnetoelectric properties, as well as
the magnetization, of BaTiO$_3$-BiFeO$_3$ superlattices can be tuned by varying
the BiFeO$_3$ layer thickness. The magnetoelectric voltage coefficient
($\alpha_{ME}$) reaches its maximum of 60.2 Vcm$^{-1}$Oe$^{-1}$ at 300 K, one
of the highest values reported so far, for a sample with a BiFeO$_3$ thickness
of 5 nm and a BaTiO$_3$ thickness of 10 nm. To gain deeper insight into the
increased magnetoelectric coupling, and both the local and macroscopic magnetic
properties, samples with varying BiFeO$_3$ thicknesses have been investigated.
Correlations were established between the hyperfine field (HFF), the
magnetoelectric voltage coefficient and the magnetization. The possible
mechanisms responsible for the strong magnetoelectric coupling are discussed.

<br>
This work deals with matter-wave bright soliton molecules in spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensates described by three-component Gross-Pitaevskii
equations with non-autonomous nonlinearities that can be tuned by Feshbach
resonance management. Notably, it portrays the possibility of generating bright
bound soliton molecules with the help of an exact analytic solution under a
controlled velocity resonance mechanism. Results show that these soliton
molecules experience the effects of time-varying nonlinearities and modulate
themselves during propagation by keeping their stable properties.
Significantly, the chosen periodic and kink-like nonlinearities expose the
snaking, bending, compression, and amplification of multi-structured soliton
molecules along with appreciable changes in their amplitude, velocity, width,
and oscillations of the molecule profiles. The present results will add
significant knowledge to a complete understanding beyond the known interaction
dynamics of matter-wave bright solitons in spinor condensates.

Here we report the anisotropic magnetotransport properties in the
superconducting state of Sn$_4$Au single crystal. Sn$_4$Au single crystal is
synthesized through an easy melt growth method. Superconducting properties are
evidenced by resistivity vs. temperature and DC magnetization measurements.
Isothermal magnetization measurements hint toward type-II superconductivity in
Sn$_4$Au. In-plane and out-of-plane resistivity measurements show anisotropic
behavior of the upper critical field at temperatures below superconducting
transition (T$_c$ = 2.3 K). The observed anisotropy is more elucidated in
resistivity measurements performed below Tc at different tilt angles. The
anisotropy parameter is found to be 1.26. The observed results show the
presence two-fold anisotropic superconducting state in Sn$_4$Au single crystal,
which may be induced due to the layered structure of synthesized Sn$_4$Au
single crystal.

Mg-based alloys are industrially used for structural applications, both as
solid solutions alloys and as composites containing intermetallic compounds.
However, a further development in terms of mechanical properties requires the
investigation of underlying causalities between synthesis, processing and
microstructure to adjust the mechanical and the corrosion properties, ideally
down to the near atomic scale. Such fundamental scientific investigations with
high resolution characterisation techniques require model materials of
exceptionally high purity and strictly controlled microstructure e.g. with
respect to grain size, morphology, chemical homogeneity as well as content and
size of oxide inclusions. In this context, the Mg-Al-Ca system appears
exceptionally challenging from a metallurgical perspective due to the high
reactivity and high vapor pressures, so that conventional industrial techniques
cannot be successfully deployed. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of
various scientific synthesis methods from arc melting over solution growth to
diffusion couples, extending to effects and parameters for thermo-mechanical
processing. Suitable pathways to overcome the specific challenges of the
Mg-Al-Ca system are demonstrated, as well as the persistent limitations of the
current state of the art laboratory metallurgy technology.

<h3>Effect of nitrogen introduced at the SiC/SiO$_2$ interface and SiC side  on the electronic states by first-principles calculation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08527</a>
<br>
<i>Keita Tachiki, Yusuke Nishiya, Jun-ichi Iwata, Yu-ichiro Matsushita</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, using first-principles calculations, we investigate the
behavior of electrons at the SiC/SiO$_2$ interface when nitrogen is introduced
as a dopant within a few nm of the SiC surface. When a highly doped nitrogen
layer (5$\times$10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$) is introduced within a few nm of the
SiC(11$\bar{2}$0) surface, the electronic state is not significantly affected
if the doping region is less than 4 nm. However, if the doping region exceeds 4
nm, the effect of quantum confinement decreases, which increases the electron
density induced in the inversion layer. As for the wave function, even when an
electric field is applied, the peak shifts toward the direction in which the
electrons are pulled away from the interface. This reduces the effect of
electron scattering at the interface and improves electron mobility.

<h3>Instability of magnetic skyrmion strings induced by longitudinal spin  currents</h3>

<br>
<i>Shun Okumura, Volodymyr P. Kravchuk, Markus Garst</i>
<br>
<br>
It is well established that spin-transfer torques exerted by in-plane spin
currents give rise to a motion of magnetic skyrmions resulting in a skyrmion
Hall effect. In films of finite thickness or in three-dimensional bulk samples
the skyrmions extend in the third direction forming a string. We demonstrate
that a spin current flowing longitudinally along the skyrmion string instead
induces a Goldstone spin wave instability. Our analytical results are confirmed
by micromagnetic simulations of both a single string as well as string lattices
suggesting that the instability eventually breaks the strings. A longitudinal
current is thus able to melt the skyrmion string lattice via a dynamical phase
transition. For films of finite thickness or in the presence of disorder a
threshold current will be required, and we estimate the latter assuming weak
collective pinning.

<br>
We study analytically the relaxation eigenmodes of a simple Monte Carlo
algorithm, corresponding to a particle in a box which moves by uniform random
jumps. Moves outside of the box are rejected. At long times, the system
approaches the equilibrium probability density, which is uniform inside the
box. We show that the relaxation towards this equilibrium is unusual: for a
jump length comparable to the size of the box, the number of relaxation
eigenmodes can be surprisingly small, one or two. We provide a complete
analytic description of the transition between these two regimes. When only a
single relaxation eigenmode is present, a suitable choice of the symmetry of
the initial conditions gives a localizing decay to equilibrium. In this case,
the deviation from equilibrium concentrates at the edges of the box where the
rejection probability is maximal. Finally, in addition to the relaxation
analysis of the master equation, we also describe the full eigen-spectrum of
the master equation including its sub-leading eigen-modes.

<br>
A variant of the U-Net convolutional neural network architecture is proposed
to estimate linear elastic compatibility stresses in a-Zr (hcp) polycrystalline
grain structures. Training data was generated using VGrain software with a
regularity alpha of 0.73 and uniform random orientation for the grain
structures and ABAQUS to evaluate the stress welds using the finite element
method. The initial dataset contains 200 samples with 20 held from training for
validation. The network gives speedups of around 200x to 6000x using a CPU or
GPU, with signifcant memory savings, compared to finite element analysis with a
modest reduction in accuracy of up to 10%. Network performance is not
correlated with grain structure regularity or texture, showing generalisation
of the network beyond the training set to arbitrary Zr crystal structures.
Performance when trained with 200 and 400 samples was measured, finding an
improvement in accuracy of approximately 10% when the size of the dataset was
doubled.

<h3>Electric-field-induced topological changes in multilamellar and in  confined lipid membranes</h3>

<br>

It is well known that lipid membranes respond to a threshold transmembrane
electric field through a reversible mechanism called electroporation, where
hydrophilic water pores form across the membrane, an effect widely used in
biological systems. The effect of such fields on interfacially-confined
(stacked or supported) lipid membranes, on the other hand, which may strongly
modulate interfacial properties, has not to our knowledge been previously
studied. Motivated by recent surface forces experiments showing a striking
effect of electric fields on lubrication by confined lipid bilayers, we carried
out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of such membranes under transverse
electric fields. We find that in addition to electroporation, a new feature
emerges of locally merged bilayers which act to bridge the confining
interfaces. These features shed light on the remodelling of confined lipid
membrane stacks by electric fields, and provides insight into how such fields
may modulate frictional and more generally surface interactions in the presence
of lipid-based boundary layers.

<h3>Tuning friction via topologically electro-convoluted lipid-membrane  boundary layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08555" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08555</a>
<br>
<i>Di Jin, Jacob Klein</i>
<br>
<br>
It was recently discovered that friction between surfaces bearing
phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers can be increased by two orders of
magnitude or more via an externally-applied electric field, and that this
increase is fully reversible when the field is switched off. While this
striking effect holds promising application potential, its molecular origin
remains unknown due to difficulty in experimentally probing confined membrane
structure at a molecular level. Our earlier molecular dynamics simulations
revealed the equilibrium electroporated structure of such confined lipid
membranes under an electric field; here we extend this approach to study the
associated sliding friction between two solid surfaces across such PC bilayers.
We identify the enhanced friction in the field as arising from membrane
undulations due to the electroporation; this leads to some dehydration at the
lipid-water interfaces, leading to closer contact and thus increased attraction
between the zwitterionic headgroups, which results in increased frictional
dissipation between the bilayers as they slide past each other. Additionally,
the electric field facilitates formation of lipid bridges spanning the
intersurface gap; at the sliding velocities of the experiments, these bridges
increase the friction by topologically-forcing the slip-plane to pass through
the acyl tail-tail interface, associated with higher dissipation during
sliding. Our results account quantitatively for the experimentally-observed
electro-modulated friction with boundary lipid bilayers, and indicate more
generally how they may affect interactions between contacting surfaces, where
high local transverse fields may be ubiquitous.

<h3>Combined investigation of collective amplitude and phase modes in a  quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave system over a wide spectral range</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate experimentally both the amplitude and phase channels of the
collective modes in the quasi-1D charge-density-wave (CDW) system, K0.3MoO3, by
combining (i) optical impulsive-Raman pump-probe and (ii) terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS), with high resolution and a detailed analysis of the
full complex-valued spectra in both cases. This allows an unequivocal
assignment of the observed bands to CDW modes across the THz range up to 9 THz.
We revise and extend a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to account for the
observed temperature dependence of the modes, where the combination of both
amplitude and phase modes allows one to robustly determine the bare-phonon and
electron-phonon coupling parameters. While the coupling is indeed strongest for
the lowest-energy phonon, dropping sharply for the immediately subsequent
phonons, it grows back significantly for the higher-energy phonons,
demonstrating their important role in driving the CDW formation. We also
include a reassessment of our previous analysis of the lowest-lying phase
modes, whereby assuming weaker electronic damping for the phase channel results
in a qualitative picture more consistent with quantum-mechanical treatments of
the collective modes, with a strongly coupled amplitudon and phason as the
lowest modes.

<br>
<br>
Coherent light-matter interactions mediated by opto-magnetic phenomena like
the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) are expected to provide a non-thermal pathway
for ultrafast manipulation of magnetism on timescales as short as the
excitation pulse itself. As the IFE scales with the spin-orbit coupling
strength of the involved electronic states, photo-exciting the strongly
spin-orbit coupled core-level electrons in magnetic materials appears as an
appealing method to transiently generate large opto-magnetic moments. Here, we
investigate this scenario in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy by using intense and
circularly polarized pulses of extreme ultraviolet radiation. Our results
reveal ultrafast and strong helicity-dependent magnetic effects which are in
line with the characteristic fingerprints of an IFE, corroborated by ab initio
opto-magnetic IFE theory and atomistic spin dynamics simulations.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we report the successful synthesis of a Fe-based novel
half-metallic quaternary Heusler alloy FeMnVGa and its structural, magnetic and
transport properties probed through different experimental methods and
theoretical technique. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed
on different types of structure reveal that Type-2 ordered structure (space
group: F-43m, Ga at 4a, V at 4b, Mn at 4c and Fe at 4d) possess minimum energy
among all the ordered variants. Ab-initio simulations in Type 2 ordered
structure further reveal that the compound is half-metallic ferromagnet (HMF)
having a large spin-polarization (89.9 %). Neutron diffraction reveal that the
compound crystalizes in disordered Type-2 structure (space group: Fm-3m) in
which Ga occupy at 4a, V at 4b and Fe/Mn occupy 4c/4d sites with 50:50
proportions. The structural disorder is further confirmed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS),57Fe Mossbauer
spectrometry results and DFT calculations. Magnetisation studies suggest that
the compound orders ferromagnetically below TC ~ 293 K and the saturation
magnetization follows Slater-Pauling rule. Mossbauer spectrometry, along with
neutron diffraction suggest that Mn is the major contributor to the total
magnetism in the compound consistent with the theoretical calculations. First
principle calculations indicate that spin-polarization remain high (81.3 %)
even in the presence of such large atomic disorder. The robustness of the HMF
property in presence of disorder is a quite unique characteristic over other
reported HMF in literature and make this compound quiet promising for
spintronics applications.

We re-examine the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions on the collective
amplitude and phase modes in the incommensurate charge-density wave ground
state of quasi-one-dimensional conductors. Using an effective action approach
we show that the longitudinal acoustic phonon protects the gapless linear
dispersion of the lowest phase mode in the presence of long-range Coulomb
interactions. Moreover, in Gaussian approximation amplitude fluctuations are
not affected by long-range Coulomb interactions. We also calculate the
collective mode dispersions at finite temperatures and compare our results with
the measured energies of amplitude and phase modes in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$. With
the exception of the lowest phase mode, the temperature dependence of the
measured mode energies can be quantitatively described within a multi-phonon
Fr\"{o}hlich model neglecting long-range Coulomb interactions.

<br>
<br>
The Josephson dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensation with Raman-induced
spin-orbit coupling is investigated. A quasi-1D trap is divided into two
reservoirs by an optical barrier. Before the tunneling between the reservoirs
is turned on, the system stays in its equilibrium ground state. For different
spin-orbit coupling parameters and interaction strengthes, the ground state
displays a rich phase diagram. In this work we focus on the plane wave phase
and the stripe phase. Our calculation shows that, when the tunneling is turned
on, the plane wave phase evolves into a dynamical stripe phase, that is, the
density of the particle changes from uniform to periodically modulated.
Basically, this stripe is described by a sine function and the wave length, the
amplitude and the initial phase of the function are all varying with time. If
the system stays in stripe phase initially, the stripes become ``sliding" when
the tunneling is turned on, which reflects the running of one of the phases of
the wave function.

<h3>Decoherent phonon effects in fast atom-surface scattering</h3>

<i>L. Frisco, M. S. Gravielle</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding the influence of phonon-mediated processes on grazing-incidence
fast atom diffraction (GIFAD) patterns is relevant for its use as a surface
analysis technique. In this work, we apply the Phonon-Surface Initial Value
Representation (P0-SIVR) approximation to study lattice vibration effects on
GIFAD patterns for the He-LiF(001) system at room temperature. The P0-SIVR
approach is a semiquantum method that describes the zero-phonon atom-surface
scattering including the contribution of intermediate phonon transitions. The
main features introduced by thermal lattice vibrations in the angular
distributions of the scattered helium atoms are investigated by considering
normal energies in the 0.1 -3 eV range. In all the cases, thermal fluctuations
introduce a wide polar spread that transforms the interference maxima into
elongated strips. We found that the polar width of these fringes does not
depend on the normal energy, as it was experimentally observed. In addition,
when the normal energy increases, not only the relative intensities of
interference peaks are affected by the crystal vibrations, but also the
visibility of the interference structures, which disappear completely for
normal energies approximately equal to or higher than 3 eV. These findings
agree fairly well with the experimental data reported in Phys. Chem. Chem.
Phys. 237615 (2021). However, it should be noticed that the simulated polar
widths underestimate the experimentally-derived limit, suggesting that there
are other mechanisms, such as inelastic phonon processes, that contribute to
the polar dispersion of the GIFAD patterns.

In this paper, we report the theoretical investigation and experimental
realization of a new spin-gapless semiconductor (SGSs) compound CoFeMnSn
belonging to the family of quaternary Heusler alloys. Through the use of
several ground-state energy calculations, the most stable structure has been
identified. Calculations of the spin-polarized band structure in optimized
structure's reveals the SGS nature of the compound. The compound form in an
ordered crystal structure and exhibit a high ferromagnetic transition
temperature (T$_{\rm C}$ = 560 K), making the material excellent for room
temperature applications. Adherence of saturation magnetization to the
Slater-Pauling rule, together with the nearly temperature-independent
resistivity, conductivity, and carrier concentration of the compound in the
temperature regime 5$-$300 K along with the low value of anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC) further confirms the SGS nature. Theoretical calculations
also reveal the robustness of the SGS state due to lattice contraction and one
can obtain a high value of intrinsic AHC using hole doping. Combined SGS and
topological properties of the compound make CoFeMnSn suitable for spintronics
and magneto-electronics devices.

We investigated the vortex phase diagram of needle shaped high quality NiBi3
single crystals by transport measurements. The current is applied along the
crystalline b-axis of this intermetallic quasi-1D BCS superconductor. The
single crystals show a Ginzburg-Levanchuk (Gi) parameter few orders of
magnitude larger than other low Tc BCS superconductors. Vortex phase diagram,
critical currents and pinning forces have been extracted from the experimental
data. The main findings are: 1) Enhancement of the vortex liquid phase in
comparison with low Tc superconductors, 2) reentrance of the liquid phase at
low fields and 3) deviation of the pinning force vs field from the usual
pinning mechanisms. The interplay between weak pinning, due to quenched
disorder, and the quasi-1D character of the material could be a hint to explain
the lack of a single pinning mechanism.

In this work, we have carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
techniques to study the diffusion coefficient of interlayer molecules at
different temperature. Within the wider context of water dynamics in soils, and
with a particular emphasis on clays, we present here the translational dynamics
of water in clays, in a bi-hydrated states. We focus on temperatures between
293 K and 350 K, i.e., the range relevant to the environmental waste packages.
A natural hectorite clay of interest is modified as a synthetic clay, which
allows us to understand the determinantal parameters from MD simulations
through a comparison with the experimental values. The activation energy E a
determined by our simulation is [8.50 - 16.62] KJ/mol. The calculated diffusive
constants are in the order of 10^{-5} {cm^{2}}/s. The simulation results are in
good agreement with experiments for the relevant set of conditions, and they
give more insight into the origin of the observed dynamics.

Charge density wave (CDW) is a spontaneous spatial modulation of electric
charges in solids whose general microscopic descriptions are yet to be
completed. Layered kagome metals of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) provide a
unique chance to realize its emergence intertwined with dimensional effects as
well as their special lattice. Here, based on a state-of-the-art molecular
dynamics simulation, we uncover that the phase transition to charge ordered
states in kagome metals is a condensation process of incoherently preformed
CDWs. We demonstrate that charge modulation first preforms on each kagome layer
at a well defined temperature but its phase fluctuation proliferates across the
entire layers with a $10^5$ times slower frequency than typical phonon
vibrations until reaching its freezing temperature. We find that the
fluctuation is not random but confined to a limited number of states as a
consequence of unavoidable degeneracy in stacking layered charge orders. As the
size of interfacial alkali atom increases, the fluctuating phases are shown to
counterbalance the condensation of orderings, resulting in a maximized
transition temperature for RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results resolve several
controversial observations on their CDW formations and highlight a crucial role
of interlayer interactions for the charge ordering in kagome metals.

Analytic mathematical models for the static spin ($G_-$) and density ($G_+$)
local field factors for the uniform electron gas (UEG) as functions of
wavevector and density are presented. These models closely fit recent quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) data and satisfy exact asymptotic limits. This model for
$G_-$ is available for the first time, and the present model for $G_+$ is an
improvement over previous work. The QMC-computed $G_\pm$ are consistent with a
rapid crossover between theoretically-derived small-$q$ and large-$q$
expansions of $G_\pm$. These expansions are completely determined by
$r_\mathrm{s}$, the UEG correlation energy per electron, and the UEG on-top
pair distribution function. We demonstrate their utility by computing uniform
electron gas correlation energies over a range of densities. These models,
which hold over an extremely wide range of densities, are recommended for use
in practical time-dependent density functional theory calculations of simple
metallic systems. A revised model of the spin susceptibility enhancement is
developed that fits QMC data, and does not show a ferromagnetic instability at
low density.

The emerging interest in tin-halide perovskites demands a robust
understanding of the fundamental properties of these materials starting from
the earliest steps of their synthesis. In a first-principles work based on
time-dependent density-functional theory, we investigate the structural,
energetic, electronic, and optical properties of 14 tin-iodide solution
complexes formed by the SnI$_2$ unit tetracoordinated with molecules of common
solvents, which we classify according to their Gutmann's donor number. We find
that all considered complexes are energetically stable and their formation
energy expectedly increases with the donating ability of the solvent. The
energies of the frontier states are affected by the choice of the solvent with
their absolute values decreasing with the donor number. The occupied orbitals
are predominantly localized on the tin-iodide unit while the unoccupied ones
are distributed also on the solvent molecules. Owing to this partial
wave-function overlap, the first optical excitation is generally weak, although
the spectral weight is red-shifted by the solvent molecules being coordinated
to SnI$_2$ in comparison to the reference obtained for this molecule alone.
Comparisons with results obtained on the same level of theory on Pb-based
counterparts corroborate our analysis. The outcomes of this study provide
quantum-mechanical insight into the fundamental properties of tin-iodide
solution complexes. This knowledge is valuable in the research on lead-free
halide perovskites and their precursors.

Alumina is historically a difficult material to characterize as a result of
both its amorphous nature and the large range of densities and local atomic
coordination topologies present. Alumina is ubiquitously employed as a
high-dielectric-constant material in electronic devices, thus understanding the
microscopic physics governing its structural and heat-transport properties is
of key relevance for e.g. the design of heat management in these devices. Here
we rely on first-principles techniques to characterize the structural,
vibrational, and thermal properties of amorphous alumina across a wide range of
densities, ranging from the record-low value of 2.28 g/cm^3 to the record-high
value of 3.49 g/cm^3. We show that the large variety of atomic coordination
topologies coexisting in this material are responsible for the emergence of
significant structural disorder at the sub-nanometer length scale. We apply the
recently developed Wigner formulation of thermal transport in solids to
characterize how the interplay between such strong topological disorder and
anharmonicity affects heat transport, showing that topological disorder
dominates over anharmonicity in determining the thermal conductivity of
amorphous alumina.

We investigate the one-magnon dynamics of the antiferromagnetic delta chain
as a paradigmatic example of tunable equilibration. Depending on the ratio of
nearest and next-nearest exchange interactions the spin system exhibits a flat
band in one-magnon space - in this case equilibration happens only partially,
whereas it appears to be complete with dispersive bands as generally expected
for generic Hamiltonians. We provide analytical as well as numerical insight
into the phenomenon.

<br>
<br>
Geometrical frustration and the enhancement of strong quantum fluctuations in
two-dimensional triangular antiferromagnets can lead to various intriguing
phenomena. Here, we studied the spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet
NdAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$. Thermodynamic and transport properties, such as magnetization
and specific heat together with the resistivity measurements were performed. In
zero field, two successive phase transitions were observed at $T_{\rm
N1}=1.75\pm 0.02$ K and $T_{\rm N2}=0.49\pm 0.02$ K, respectively. Under
magnetic field, $\rm XXZ$-type anisotropy was revealed, with the moments
pointing along the easy $c$ axis. For $B\parallel c$, multiple field-induced
states were observed, and the magnetic phase diagram was established based on
the specific heat and magnetization data. The temperature-dependent resistivity
measurements indicate that NdAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ is a good metal. It is very likely
that both the long-range RKKY interactions and the geometrical frustration play
an important roles in this case.

<br>
<br>
In this report, we investigated a new rare earth based one-dimensional Ising
spin chain magnet~\DNG~by means of magnetization, specific heat and powder
neutron diffraction measurements. Due to the crystalline electrical field
splitting, the magnetic Dy ions share an Ising like ground doublet state.
Owning to the local point symmetry, these Ising moments form into two canted
magnetic sublattices, which were further confirmed by the angle-dependent
magnetization measurement. In zero fields, two successive antiferromagnetic
phase transitions were found at temperatures $T_{\mathrm{N1}}=6~\rm K$ and
$T_{\mathrm{N2}}=5~\rm K$, respectively. Only part of the moments are
statically ordered in this intermediate state between $T_{\mathrm{N1}}$ and
$T_{\mathrm{N2}}$. Powder neutron diffraction experiments at different
temperatures were performed as well. An incommensurate magnetic propagation
vector of $\mathbf{k_{\rm m}}=(0.5,0.4,0.5)$ was identified. The refined spin
configurations through the irreducible representation analysis confirmed that
these Ising spins are canted in the crystal $ab$~plane.

<h3>Intrinsic optical absorption in Dirac metals</h3>

A Dirac metal is a doped (gated) Dirac material with the Fermi energy
($E_\text{F}$) lying either in the conduction or valence bands. In the
non-interacting picture, optical absorption in gapless Dirac metals occurs only
if the frequency of incident photons ($\Omega$) exceeds the direct (Pauli)
frequency threshold, equal to $2E_\text{F}$. In this work, we study, both
analytically and numerically, the role of electron-electron ($ee$) and
electron-hole ($eh$) interactions in optical absorption of two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) Dirac metals in the entire interval of frequencies
below $2E_\text{F}$. We show that, for $\Omega\ll E_\text{F}$, the optical
conductivity, $\Re\sigma(\Omega)$, arising from the combination of $ee$ and
certain $eh$ scattering processes, scales as $\Omega^2\ln\Omega$ in 2D and as
$\Omega^2$ in 3D, respectively, both for short-range (Hubbard) and long-range
(screened Coulomb) interactions. Another type of $eh$ processes, similar to
Auger-Meitner (AM) processes in atomic physics, starts to contribute for
$\Omega$ above the direct threshold, equal to $E_\text{F}$. Similar to the case
of doped semiconductors with parabolic bands studied in prior literature, the
AM contribution to $\Re\sigma(\Omega)$ in Dirac metals is manifested by a
threshold singularity, $\Re\sigma(\Omega)\propto (\Omega-E_\text{F})^{d+2}$,
where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality and $0<\Omega-E_\text{F}\ll
E_\text{F}$. In contrast to doped semiconductors, however, the AM contribution
in Dirac metals is completely overshadowed by the $ee$ and other $eh$
contributions. Numerically, $\Re\sigma(\Omega)$ happens to be small in almost
the entire range of $\Omega<2E_\text{F}$. This finding may have important
consequences for collective modes in Dirac metals lying below $2E_\text{F}$.

We apply a perturbative Doi--Peliti field-theoretical analysis to the
stochastic spatially extended symmetric Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) and
May--Leonard (ML) models, in which three species compete cyclically. Compared
to the two-species Lotka--Volterra predator-prey (LV) model, according to
numerical simulations, these cyclical models appear to be less affected by
intrinsic stochastic fluctuations. Indeed, we demonstrate that the qualitative
features of the ML model are insensitive to intrinsic reaction noise. In
contrast, and although not yet observed in numerical simulations, we find that
the RPS model acquires significant fluctuation-induced renormalizations in the
perturbative regime, similar to the LV model. We also study the formation of
spatio-temporal structures in the framework of stability analysis and provide a
clearcut explanation for the absence of spatial patterns in the RPS system,
whereas the spontaneous emergence of spatio-temporal structures features
prominently in the LV and the ML models.

<h3>Tuning the anomalous Nernst and Hall effects with shifting the chemical  potential in Fe-dope and Ni-doped Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is believed to be a magnetic Weyl semimetal. It displays
large anomalous Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects with a remarkably large
anomalous Hall angle. Here, we present a comprehensive study of how
substituting Co by Fe or Ni affects the electrical and thermoelectric
transport. We find that doping alters the amplitude of the anomalous transverse
coefficients. The maximum decrease in the amplitude of the low-temperature
anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma^A_{ij}$ is twofold. Comparing our results
with theoretical calculations of the Berry spectrum assuming a rigid shift of
the Fermi level, we find that given the modest shift in the position of the
chemical potential induced by doping, the experimentally observed variation
occurs five times faster than expected. Doping affects the amplitude and the
sign of the anomalous Nernst coefficient. Despite these drastic changes, the
amplitude of the $\alpha^A_{ij}/\sigma^A_{ij}$ ratio at the Curie temperature
remains close to $\approx 0.5 k_B/e$, in agreement with the scaling
relationship observed across many topological magnets.

<h3>Absence of near-ambient superconductivity in LuH$_{2\pm\text{x}}$N$_y$</h3>

<br>

Recently near-ambient superconductivity was claimed in N-doped lutetium
hydride [1]. This induces a worldwide fanaticism about the dream of room
temperature superconductivity under low pressures. By using a high pressure and
high temperature synthesis technique, we have successfully obtained the
nitrogen doped lutetium hydride (LuH$_{2\pm\text{x}}$N$_y$) with a dark-bluish
color and a structure with the space group of $Fm\bar{3}m$ evidenced by x-ray
diffraction. This structure is the same as that reported in Ref. [1]. The
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the existence of nitrogen
in some areas of the samples. At ambient pressure, we witness a kink of
resistivity and magnetization at about 300 K, which may correspond to a
rearrangement of hydrogen/nitrogen atoms, namely a structural transition.
However, by applying a pressure from 1 GPa to 6 GPa, we have seen a
progressively optimized metallic behavior without showing superconductivity
down to 10 K. Temperature dependence of magnetization shows a flat feature
between 100 and 320 K, and the magnetization increases with magnetic field at
100 K, all these are not expected for superconductivity at 100 K. Thus, we
conclude the absence of near-ambient superconductivity in this nitrogen-doped
lutetium hydride under pressures below 6 GPa.

<h3>Diffusiophoresis and medium structure control macroscopic particle  transport in porous media</h3>

In this letter, we show that pore-scale diffusiophoresis of colloidal
particles along local salt gradients manifests in the macroscopic dispersion of
particles in a porous medium. Despite is transient character, this microscopic
phenomenon controls large-scale particle transport by altering their
partitioning between transmitting and dead-end pores. It determines the
distribution of residence and arrival times in the medium. Depending on the
diffusiophoretic mobility, particles can be mobilized from or trapped in
dead-end pores, which provides a means for the controlled manipulation of
particles in porous media.

<h3>Low-frequency quantum oscillations in LaRhIn$_5$: Dirac point or nodal  line?</h3>

<br>
<i>G.P. Mikitik, Yu.V. Sharlai</i>
<br>
<br>
In the recent paper [1], a new method based on measuring a temperature
correction to a quantum-oscillation frequency was proposed to study an
energy-band dispersion of charge carriers in small Fermi surface (FS) pockets
of crystals. To illustrate their approach, Guo et al. [1] applied it to a
number of materials and, in particular, to the multiband metal LaRhIn$_5$
which, apart from high-frequency oscillations associated with a large FS, also
exhibits the oscillations with the low frequency $F\approx 7$ T. Although the
method of Ref. [1] really detects charge carriers with a linear dispersion, it
does not distinguish between the carriers near a Dirac point and near a nodal
line, since all such quasiparticles disperse linearly. Here we ask what is the
nature of the carriers associated with the frequency $F$ in LaRhIn$_5$ and call
attention to the puzzling origin of this frequency.

<h3>Elastocaloric effect of the heavy-fermion system YbPtBi</h3>

<br>
<br>
YbPtBi is one of the heavy-fermion systems with largest Sommerfeld
coefficient $\gamma$ and is thus classified as a `super'-heavy fermion
material. In this work, we resolve the long-debated question about the
hierarchy of relevant energy scales, such as crystal-electric field (CEF)
levels, Kondo and magnetic ordering temperature, in YbPtBi. Through
measurements of the a.c. elastocaloric effect and generic symmetry arguments,
we identify an \textit{elastic level splitting} that is uniquely associated
with the symmetry-allowed splitting of a quartet CEF level. This quartet, which
we identify to be the first excited state at $\Delta/k_\text B\approx1.6\,\rm
K$ above the doublet ground state at ambient pressure, is well below the Kondo
temperature $T_\text K\approx10\,\rm K$. Thus, our analysis provides strong
support for models that predict that the heavy electron mass is a result of an
enhanced degeneracy of the CEF ground state, i.e., a quasi-sextet in YbPtBi. At
the same time, our study shows the potential of the a.c. elastocaloric effect
to control and quantify strain-induced changes of the CEF schemes, opening a
different route to disentangle the CEF energy scales from other relevant energy
scales in correlated quantum materials.

The development of Quantum Simulators, artificial platforms where the
predictions of many-body theories of correlated quantum materials can be tested
in a controllable and tunable way, is one of the main challenges of condensed
matter physics. Here we introduce artificial lattices made of lead halide
perovskite nanocubes as a new platform to simulate and investigate the physics
of correlated quantum materials. The ultrafast optical injection of quantum
confined excitons plays the role of doping in real materials. We show that, at
large photo-doping, the exciton gas undergoes an excitonic Mott transition,
which fully realizes the magnetic-field-driven insulator-to-metal transition
described by the Hubbard model. At lower photo-doping, the long-range
interactions drive the formation of a collective superradiant state, in which
the phases of the excitons generated in each single perovskite nanocube are
coherently locked. Our results demonstrate that time-resolved experiments span
a parameter region of the Hubbard model in which long-range and phase-coherent
orders emerge out of a doped Mott insulating phase. This physics is relevant
for a broad class of phenomena, such as superconductivity and charge-density
waves in correlated materials whose properties are captured by doped Hubbard
models.

We present a perturbation method to compute the out-of-time-ordered
correlator in the strongly disordered Heisenberg XXZ model in the deep
many-body localized regime. We characterize the discrete structure of the
information propagation across the eigenstates, revealing a highly structured
light cone confined by the strictly logarithmic upper and lower bounds
representing the slowest and fastest scrambling available in this system. We
explain those bounds by deriving the closed-form expression of the effective
interaction for the slowest scrambling and by constructing the effective model
of a half-length for the fastest scrambling. We extend our lowest-order
perturbation formulations to the higher dimensions, proposing that the
logarithmic upper and lower light cones may persist in two dimensions in the
limit of strong disorder and weak hopping.

We explore theoretically how the topological properties of 2D materials can
be manipulated by cavity quantum electromagnetic fields for both resonant and
off-resonant electron-photon coupling, with a focus on van der Waals moir\'e
superlattices. We investigate an electron-photon topological Chern number for
the cavity-dressed energy minibands that is well defined for any degree of
hybridization of the electron and photon states. While an off-resonant cavity
mode can renormalize electronic topological phases that exist without cavity
coupling, we show that when the cavity mode is resonant to electronic miniband
transitions, new and higher electron-photon Chern numbers can emerge.
