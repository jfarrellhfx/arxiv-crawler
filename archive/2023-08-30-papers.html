<h3>Exact mobility edges in finite-height Wannier-Stark ladders</h3>

We investigate the single-particle localization transition in one-dimensional
Wannier-Stark ladders with either a linear potential or a mosaic potential with
spacing $\kappa=2$. In both cases, we exactly determine the mobility edges
separating the Wannier-Stark localized states from extended states for a finite
potential height. Especially in the latter case, we obtain mobility edges
through a revised Lyapunov exponent, and demonstrate a rich phase diagram with
extended states, weakly Wannier-Stark localized states, and strongly
Wannier-Stark localized states. Our results also exhibit that mobility edges
are highly dependent on the height of the ladder and extended states only
survive at $E\approx0$ for the high ladder. Finally, we perform the simulation
of the dynamical evolution for possible experimental observations. These
interesting features will shed light on the study of localization phenomena in
disorder-free systems.

<h3>RKKY interaction in triplet superconductors: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type  interaction mediated by spin-polarized Cooper pairs</h3>

The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction governs the coupling
between localized spins and is strongly affected by the environment in which
these spins reside. In superconductors, this interaction becomes long-ranged
and provides information about the orbital symmetry of the superconducting
order parameter. In this work, we consider the RKKY interaction between
localized spins mediated by a $p$-wave triplet superconductor. In contrast to
the well-studied RKKY interaction in $d$-wave superconductors, we find that the
spin of the Cooper pair in a triplet state also modulates the spin-spin
coupling. We consider several different types of $p$-wave triplet states, and
find that the form of the RKKY interaction changes significantly with the
symmetries of the order parameter. For non-unitary superconducting states, two
new terms appear in the RKKY interaction: a background spin magnetization
coupling to the individual spins and, more interestingly, an effective
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. The latter term oscillates with the separation
distance between the impurity spins. Finally, we find that the finite spin
expectation value in non-unitary superconductors in concert with the
conventional RKKY interaction can lead to non-collinear magnetic ground states
even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term is negligible. The RKKY interaction in
$p$-wave triplet superconductors thus offers a way to achieve new ground state
spin configurations of impurity spins and simultaneously provides information
about the underlying superconducting state.

<h3>Chiral fluid membranes with orientational order and multiple edges</h3>

We carry out Monte Carlo simulations on fluid membranes with orientational
order and multiple edges in the presence and absence of external forces. The
membrane resists bending and has an edge tension, the orientational order
couples with the membrane surface normal through a cost for tilting, and there
is a chiral liquid crystalline interaction. In the absence of external forces,
a membrane initialized as a vesicle will form a disk at low chirality, with the
directors forming a smectic-A phase with alignment perpendicular to the
membrane surface except near the edge. At large chirality a catenoid-like shape
or a trinoid-like shape is formed, depending on the number of edges in the
initial vesicle. This shape change is accompanied by cholesteric ordering of
the directors and multiple $\pi$ walls connecting the membrane edges and
wrapping around the membrane neck. If the membrane is initialized instead in a
cylindrical shape and stretched by an external force, it maintains a nearly
cylindrical shape but additional liquid crystalline phases appear. For large
tilt coupling and low chirality, a smectic-A phase forms. For lower values of
the tilt coupling, a nematic phase appears at zero chirality with the average
director oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the membrane, while for
nonzero chirality a cholesteric phase appears. The $\pi$ walls are tilt walls
at low chirality and transition to twist walls as chirality is increased. We
construct a continuum model of the director field to explain this behavior.

<h3>Information Bounds on phase transitions in disordered systems</h3>

Information theory, rooted in computer science, and many-body physics, have
traditionally been studied as (almost) independent fields. Only recently has
this paradigm started to shift, with many-body physics being studied and
characterized using tools developed in information theory. In our work, we
introduce a new perspective on this connection, and study phase transitions in
models with randomness, such as localization in disordered systems, or random
quantum circuits with measurements. Utilizing information-based arguments
regarding probability distribution differentiation, we bound critical exponents
in such phase transitions (specifically, those controlling the correlation or
localization lengths). We benchmark our method and rederive the well-known
Harris criterion, bounding critical exponents in the Anderson localization
transition for noninteracting particles, as well as classical disordered spin
systems. We then move on to apply our method to many-body localization. While
in real space our critical exponent bound agrees with recent consensus, we find
that, somewhat surprisingly, numerical results on Fock-space localization for
limited-sized systems do not obey our bounds, indicating that the simulation
results might not hold asymptotically (similarly to what is now believed to
have occurred in the real-space problem). We also apply our approach to random
quantum circuits with random measurements, for which we can derive bounds
transcending recent mappings to percolation problems.

The experimental characterization of quantum spin liquids poses significant
challenges due to the absence of long-range magnetic order, even at absolute
zero temperature. The identification of these states of matter often relies on
the analysis of their excitations. In this paper, we propose a method for
detecting the signatures of the fractionalized excitations in quantum spin
liquids using a tunneling spectroscopy setup. Inspired by the recent
development of the quantum twisting microscope, we consider a planar tunneling
junction, in which a candidate quantum spin liquid material is placed between
two graphene layers. By tuning the relative twist angle and voltage bias
between the leads, we can extract the dynamical spin structure factor of the
tunneling barrier with momentum and energy resolution. Our proposal presents a
promising tool for experimentally characterizing quantum spin liquids in
two-dimensional materials.

<h3>Exactly Solvable Model of Randomly Coupled Twisted Superconducting  Bilayers</h3>

Motivated by recent experiments on twisted junctions of cuprate
superconductors (SC), it was proposed [1] that at zero temperature, a random
first order Josephson coupling $J_1(\textbf{r}) \cos \phi$ generates an
"effective" global second order coupling, $J_2\cos(2\phi)$, with a sign that
favors $\phi = \pm \pi/2$, i.e., spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry
(TRS). To obtain a more controlled understanding of the suggested
"disorder-induced-order" mechanism, we construct an exactly solvable lattice
mean field model and prove that when the disorder-average $\bar{J}_1=0$, the
model exhibits a TRS breaking phase for all temperatures below the SC
transition, i.e., $T_c = T_{\mathrm{TRSB}}$, regardless of the specific form of
disorder. In the presence of nonzero $\bar{J}_1\ne 0$, we show that the two
transitions split linearly for small $\bar{J}_1 \ll \kappa$ (where $\kappa$ is
the in-plane SC stiffness), and that $T_{\mathrm{TRSB}}$ vanishes for $\bar
J_1> J_c$ where $ J_c= \overline{J^2_1}/\kappa$ in the weak disorder limit.

<h3>The two critical temperatures conundrum in  La$_{1.75}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$</h3>

The in-plane and out-of-plane components of the stiffness tensor in LSCO,
show different transition temperatures, with strong variations of the
interplane stiffness on sample width. Disorder and critical finite size
corrections are too small to explain these effects. With evidence from Monte
Carlo simulations, we show that due to the high anisotropy, a three dimensional
sample approaching the transition temperature $T_c$ acts as a quasi one
dimensional Josephson array. As such, the interplane stiffness exhibits an
essential singularity $\sim exp(-A/|T-T_c|^{2\beta})$. At finite experimental
or numerical resolution, the interplane stiffness always {\it appears} to
vanish at a lower temperature than the in-plane stiffness. An analogy to
studies of helium superfluids in nanopores is made.

<h3>Nematic and stripe orders within the charge density wave state of doped  TiSe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Muñoz-Segovia, Jörn W. F. Venderbos, Adolfo G. Grushin, Fernando de Juan</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we present a theory to reconcile conflicting experimental
claims regarding the charge density wave (CDW) state in TiSe$_2$, including
whether there is a single or multiple CDW transitions and the occasional
observation of rotation symmetry breaking. Using a
$\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ model coupled to the CDW order parameter,
we show how commonplace conduction band doping $x$ must cause a transition from
the $C_3$-symmetric $3Q$ state to a $C_3$-breaking $1Q$ stripe state at a
critical doping $x_{1Q}$. In addition, for sufficient ellipticity of the
conduction bands, as displayed by the realistic band stucture of TiSe$_2$, a
new nematic $3Q$ state also emerges in a region with $x < x_{1Q}$. We then show
how both stripe and nematic states emerge from a minimal interacting
tight-binding model, for both positive and negative initial gaps. Our theory
clarifies a long-standing puzzle and its predictions can be verified with a
variety of probes including transport, photoemission and tunneling.

<h3>$\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric topological phases with Pontryagin  index in three spatial dimensions</h3>

<br>

We report on a certain class of three-dimensional topological insulators and
semimetals protected by spinless $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, hosting an
integer-valued bulk invariant. We show using homotopy arguments that these
phases host multi-gap topology, providing a realization of a single
$\mathbb{Z}$ invariant in three spatial dimensions that is distinct from the
Hopf index. We identify this invariant with the Pontryagin index, which
describes BPST instantons in particle physics contexts and corresponds to a
3-sphere winding number. We study naturally arising multi-gap linked nodal
rings, topologically characterized by split-biquaternion charges, which can be
removed by non-Abelian braiding of nodal rings, even without closing a gap. We
additionally connect the describing winding number in terms of gauge-invariant
combinations of non-Abelian Berry connection elements, indicating relations to
Pontryagin characteristic class in four dimensions. These topological
configurations are furthermore related to fully non-degenerate multi-gap phases
that are characterized by a pair of winding numbers relating to two isoclinic
rotations in the case of four bands and can be generalized to an arbitrary
number of bands. From a physical perspective, we also analyze the edge states
corresponding to this Pontryagin index as well as their dissolution subject to
the gap-closing disorder. Finally, we elaborate on the realization of these
novel non-Abelian phases, their edge states and linked nodal structures in
acoustic metamaterials and trapped-ion experiments.

<h3>The structure of quasiparticles in a local Fermi liquid</h3>

Conduction electrons interacting with a dynamic impurity can give rise to a
local Fermi liquid. The latter has the same low energy spectrum as an ideal
Fermi gas containing a static impurity. The Fermi liquids's elementary
excitations are however not bare electrons. In the vicinity of the impurity,
they are dressed by virtual particle-hole pairs. Here we study this dressing.
Among other things, we construct a mode-resolved measure of dressing. To
evaluate it in position representation, we have to circumvent the limitations
of the Numerical Renormalization Group, which discretizes the conduction band
logarithmically. We therefore extend Natural Orbital methods, that successfully
characterize the ground state, to describe excitations. We demonstrate that the
dressing profile shows nontrivial powerlaw decay at large distances. Our
Natural Orbital methodology could lay the foundation for calculating the
properties of local Fermi liquid quasiparticles in nontrivial geometries such
as disordered hosts or mesoscopic devices.

<h3>Giant elastocaloric effect at low temperatures in TmVO$_4$ and  implications for cryogenic cooling</h3>

<br>
<br>
Adiabatic decompression of para-quadrupolar materials has significant
potential as a cryogenic cooling technology. We focus on TmVO$_4$, an
archetypal material that undergoes a continuous phase transition to a
ferroquadrupole-ordered state at 2.15 K. Above the phase transition, each Tm
ion contributes an entropy of $k_B \ln{2}$ due to the degeneracy of the crystal
electric field groundstate. Owing to the large magnetoelastic coupling, which
is a prerequisite for a material to undergo a phase transition via the
cooperative Jahn-Teller effect, this level splitting, and hence the entropy,
can be readily tuned by externally-induced strain. Using a dynamic technique in
which the strain is rapidly oscillated, we measure the adiabatic elastocaloric
coefficient of single-crystal TmVO$_4$, and thus experimentally obtain the
entropy landscape as a function of strain and temperature. The measurement
confirms the suitability of this class of materials for cryogenic cooling
applications, and provides insight to the dynamic quadrupole strain
susceptibility.

<h3>Identifying Constitutive Parameters for Complex Hyperelastic Solids  using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</h3>

<br>

Identifying constitutive parameters in engineering and biological materials,
particularly those with intricate geometries and mechanical behaviors, remains
a longstanding challenge. The recent advent of Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) offers promising solutions, but current frameworks are often limited to
basic constitutive laws and encounter practical constraints when combined with
experimental data. In this paper, we introduce a new PINN-based framework
designed to identify material parameters for soft materials, specifically those
exhibiting complex constitutive behaviors, under large deformation in plane
stress conditions. Distinctively, our model emphasizes training PINNs with
multi-modal time-dependent experimental datasets consisting of full-field
deformation and loading history, ensuring algorithm robustness even amidst
noisy data. Our results reveal that our framework can accurately identify
constitutive parameters of the incompressible Arruda-Boyce model for samples
with intricate geometries, maintaining an error below 5%, even with an
experimental noise level of 5%. We believe our framework sets the stage for a
transformative approach in modulus identification for complex solids,
especially for those with geometrical and constitutive intricate.

<h3>A differential approach to investigate universal scaling in  far-from-equilibrium quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15646" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15646</a>
<br>
<i>L. Madeira, A.D. García-Orozco, M.A. Moreno-Armijos, A.R. Fritsch, V.S. Bagnato</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent progress in out-of-equilibrium closed quantum systems has
significantly advanced the understanding of mechanisms behind their evolution
towards thermalization. Notably, the concept of non-thermal fixed points
(NTFPs) - responsible for the emergence of spatio-temporal universal scaling in
far-from-equilibrium systems - has played a crucial role in both theoretical
and experimental investigations. In this work, we introduce a differential
equation that has the universal scaling associated with NTFPs as a solution.
The advantage of working with a differential equation, rather than only with
its solution, is that we can extract several insightful properties not
necessarily present in the solution alone. Employing two limiting cases of the
equation, we determined the universal exponents related to the scaling using
the distributions near just two momentum values. We established a strong
agreement with previous investigations by validating this approach with three
distinct physical systems. This consistency highlights the universal nature of
scaling due to NTFPs and emphasizes the predictive capabilities of the proposed
differential equation. Moreover, under specific conditions, the equation
predicts a power-law related to the ratio of the two universal exponents,
leading to implications concerning particle and energy transport. This suggests
that the observed power-laws in far-from-equilibrium turbulent fluids could be
related to the universal scaling due to NTFPs, potentially offering new
insights into the study of turbulence.

<h3>Statistical methods for resolving poor uncertainty quantification in  machine learning interatomic potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15653</a>
<br>
<i>Emil Annevelink, Venkatasubramanian Viswanathan</i>
<br>
<br>
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are promising surrogates for
quantum mechanics evaluations in ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations due
to their ability to reproduce the energy and force landscape within chemical
accuracy at four orders of magnitude less cost. While developing uncertainty
quantification (UQ) tools for MLIPs is critical to build production MLIP
datasets using active learning, only limited progress has been made and the
most robust method, ensembling, still shows low correlation between high error
and high uncertainty predictions. Here we develop a rigorous method rooted in
statistics for determining an error cutoff that distinguishes regions of high
and low UQ performance. The statistical cutoff illuminates that a main cause of
the poor UQ performance is due to the machine learning model already describing
the entire dataset and not having any datapoints with error greater than the
statistical error distribution. Second, we extend the statistical analysis to
create an interpretable connection between the error and uncertainty
distributions to predict an uncertainty cutoff separating high and low errors.
We showcase the statistical cutoff in active learning benchmarks on two
datasets of varying chemical complexity for three common UQ methods:
ensembling, sparse Gaussian processes, and latent distance metrics and compare
them to the true error and random sampling, showing that the statistical cutoff
is generalizable to a variety of different UQ methods and protocols and
performs similarly to using the true error. Importantly, we conclude that
utilizing this uncertainty cutoff enables using significantly lower cost
uncertainty quantification tools such as sparse gaussian processes and latent
distances compared to ensembling approaches for generating MLIP datasets at a
fraction of the cost.

A quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator breaks reciprocity by combining
magnetic polarization and spin-orbit coupling to generate a unidirectional
transmission of signals in the absence of an external magnetic field. Such
behavior makes QAH materials a good platform for the innovation of circulator
technologies. However, it remains elusive as to how the wavelength of the
chiral edge plasmon relates to its frequency and how the plasmon wave packet is
excited in the time domain in a QAH insulator. Here, we investigate the edge
magnetoplasmon (EMP) resonances in Cr-(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ by frequency and time
domain measurements. From disk shaped samples with various dimensions, we
obtain the dispersion relation of EMPs and extract the drift velocity of the
chiral edge state. From the time-resolved transport measurements, we identify
the velocity of the plasmon wave packet and observe a transition from the edge
to bulk transport at an elevated temperature. We show that the frequency and
time domain measurements are well modeled by loss from the microwave induced
dissipative channels in the bulk area. Our results demonstrate that the EMP
decay rate can be significantly reduced by applying a low microwave power and
fabricating devices of larger diameter $\ge100~\mu$m. In a $R=125~\mu$m sample,
a non-reciprocity of 20 dB has been realized at 1.3 GHz, shining light on using
QAH insulators to develop on-chip non-reciprocal devices.

The rising interest in Dirac materials, condensed matter systems where
low-energy electronic excitations are described by the relativistic Dirac
Hamiltonian, entails a need for microscopic effective models to analytically
describe their transport properties. Specifically, for the study of quantum
transport, these effective models must take into account the effect of
atomic-scale interfaces and the presence of well-defined edges while
reproducing the correct band structure. We develop a general method to
analytically compute the microscopic Green's function of Dirac materials valid
for infinite, semi-infinite, and finite two-dimensional layers with zigzag or
armchair edge orientations. We test our method by computing the density of
states and scattering probabilities of germanene and some transition metal
dichalcogenides, obtaining simple analytical formulas. Our results provide a
useful analytical tool for the interpretation of transport experiments on Dirac
materials and could be extended to describe additional degrees of freedom like
extra layers, superconductivity, etc.

<br>
<br>
In this study, we compare the performance of two phases of MoS$_2$
monolayers: 1T' and 2H, about their ability to adsorb lithium and sodium ions.
Employing the density functional theory and molecular dynamics, we include the
ion concentration to analyze the electronic structure, ion kinetics, and
battery performance. The pristine 2H-MoS$_2$ monolayer is the ground state.
However, the charge transfer effects above a critical ion concentration yields
a stability change, where the 1T'-MoS$_2$ monolayer with adsorbed ions becomes
more stable thanthe 2H counterpart. The diffusion of ions onto the 1T'
monolayer is anisotropic, being more efficient at ion adsorption than the 2H
phase. Finally, we calculate the open circuit voltage and specific capacity,
confirming that the 1T'-MoS$_2$ phase has great potential for developing
lithium/sodium ion batteries.

<br>
<br>
$GdTe_{3}$ is a layered antiferromagnet belonging to the family of rare-earth
square net tritellurides which has recently attracted much attention due to its
exceptionally high mobility, the presence of a novel unidirectional
incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) state, superconductivity under
pressure, and a cascade of magnetic transitions between 12 and 7 K, whose order
parameters are as yet unknown. Since the itinerant electrons and localized
moments reside on different crystalline planes in this family of compounds,
spin-charge interactions could potentially result in unexpected phases in this
system. In this work, we use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to
directly image the charge and magnetic orders in $GdTe_{3}$. Below 7 K, we find
a striped antiferromagnetic phase with twice the periodicity of the Gd lattice
and perpendicular to the CDW order. Intriguingly, between 7 and 12 K, we
discover a spin density wave which has the same periodicity as the CDW. Using a
minimal Landau free energy model we show that the spin density wave can arise
from a bulk incipient antiferromagnetic order oriented along the
$\textit{c}$-axis that couples to the CDW order. Our work reveals the order
parameters of the cascade of low temperature magnetic phases in $GdTe_{3}$ and
shows how the interplay between the charge and spin sectors can generate
multiple coexisting magnetic orders in this class of materials.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their structural uniqueness, exceptional
properties, and wide-ranging applications, show unprecedented prospects in
fundamental physics research and industrial applications. 2D \b{eta}-phase
cuprous iodide (\b{eta}-CuI) is a promising candidate for overcoming the
challenges of insufficient P-type transparent conductive materials, with
multiple predicted unique properties. Previous experimental results show that
\b{eta}-CuI only occurs at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675 K. Many
efforts are made to stabilize \b{eta}-CuI at room temperature through
surface/interface engineering. However, the resulting composites limit the
performance and application of pure 2D \b{eta}-CuI. Here, we demonstrate
experimentally that isolated 2D \b{eta}-CuI single crystals can exist stably
under ambient conditions, a high-temperature phase CuI found at room
temperature. We validate the simultaneous existence of {\gamma}-CuI and
\b{eta}-CuI in the synthesized CuI. The previous neglect of \b{eta}-CuI
crystals can be ascribed to factors including their low content, small
dimensions, and lack of ingenious experimental characterization. Moreover, the
theoretical calculation further confirms dynamically and thermally stable of
the monolayer \b{eta}-CuI, which has an ultra-wide direct band-gap (3.66 eV).
Our findings challenge the traditional understanding of \b{eta}-CuI as a
high-temperature phase of CuI, instead providing a new definition that 2D
\b{eta}-CuI exhibits remarkable stability under ambient conditions.

Percolation on a five-dimensional simple hypercubic (sc(5)) lattice with
extended neighborhoods is investigated by means of extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, using an effective single-cluster growth algorithm. The critical
exponents, including $\tau$ and $\Omega$, the asymptotic behavior of the

Using the bond and site percolation thresholds $p_c = 0.11817145(3)$ and
$0.14079633(4)$ respectively given by Mertens and Moore [Phys. Rev. E 98,
022120 (2018)], we find critical exponents of $\tau = 2.4177(3)$, $\Omega =
0.27(2)$ through a self-consistent process. The value of $\tau$ compares
favorably with a recent five-loop renormalization predictions $2.4175(2)$ by
Borinsky et al. [Phys. Rev. D 103, 116024 (2021)], the value 2.4180(6) that
follows from the work of Zhang et al. [Physica A 580, 126124 (2021)], and the
measurement of $2.419(1)$ by Mertens and Moore. We also confirmed the bond
threshold, finding $p_c = 0.11817150(5)$. sc(5) lattices with extended
neighborhoods up to 7th nearest neighbors are studied for both bond and site
percolation. Employing the values of $\tau$ and $\Omega$ mentioned above,
thresholds are found to high precision. For bond percolation, the asymptotic
value of $zp_c$ tends to Bethe-lattice behavior ($z p_c \sim 1$), and the
finite-$z$ correction is found to be consistent with both and $zp_{c} - 1 \sim
a_1 z^{-0.88}$ and $zp_{c} - 1 \sim a_0(3 + \ln z)/z$. For site percolation,
the asymptotic analysis is close to the predicted behavior $zp_c \sim 32\eta_c
= 1.742(2)$ for large $z$, where $\eta_c = 0.05443(7)$ is the continuum
percolation threshold of five-dimensional hyperspheres given by Torquato and
Jiao [J. Chem. Phys 137, 074106 (2015)]; finite-$z$ corrections are accounted
for by taking $p_c \approx c/(z + b)$ with $c=1.722(7)$ and $b=1$.

Ordered electronic states have been extensively explored in cuprates and
iron-based unconventional superconductors, but seldom observed in the epitaxial
FeSe/SrTiO3(001) monolayer (FeSe/STO) with an enhanced superconducting
transition temperature (Tc). Here, by using scanning tunneling microscopy/
spectroscopy (STM/STS), we reveal a checkerboard charge order in the epitaxial
FeSe/STO monolayer, with a period of four times the inter-Fe-atom distance
along two perpendicular directions of the Fe lattice. This ordered state is
uniquely present in the superconducting FeSe/STO monolayer, even at liquid
nitrogen temperature, but absent in the non-superconducting FeSe monolayer or
bilayer. Quasiparticle interference (QPI) measurements further confirm it as a
static order without an energy-dependent dispersion and gapped out within the
superconductivity gap. The intensity of the charge order shows an enhancement
near the superconducting transition temperature, thus implying a correlation
with the high-Tc superconductivity in the FeSe/STO monolayer. This study
provides a new basis for exploring the ordered electronic states and their
interplay with high-Tc superconductivity in the FeSe monolayer.

Understanding how much energy is needed and dissipated as heat for a given
computational system and for a given program is a physically interesting and
practically important problem. However, the thermodynamic costs of
computational systems are only partially understood. In this paper, we focus on
a specific logic gate, the CMOS NAND gate, operating in the sub-threshold
region and analyze the dissipated heat from two aspects. One is the general
Landauer bound, which is the change in entropy of the computational system, and
the other is a cost that depends on the difference between the initial and
steady-state distributions of the system. We find that the general Landauer
bound is the same order for different inputs to the gate, but that the another
cost has partially different order due to the difference between the initial
and steady-state distributions over output logical states. We also investigate
the interplay between the costs, time scale, and reliability of the process and
find that for different inputs, there is not always a trade-off between
reliability and dissipation of computations.

<br>
<br>
Linear complexions are stable defect states, where the stress field
associated with a dislocation induces a local phase transformation that remains
restricted to nanoscale dimensions. As these complexions are born at the
defects which control plasticity in metals, it is crucial to understand their
impact on subsequent mechanical properties. In this work, atomistic modeling is
used to understand how dislocation mechanics are altered by the presence of
nanoparticle array linear complexions in a Ni-Al alloy. Molecular dynamics
simulations are used to identify the critical shear stress needed to drive
dislocation breakaway, first for nanoparticle arrays formed by Monte
Carlo/molecular dynamics methods to represent realistic configurations and
subsequently for simplified models that allow the effects of particle spacing
and size to be varied in a controlled manner. A combined bowing and progressive
unpinning mechanism is uncovered, leading to the demonstration of a new
strength scaling law that differs in keys ways from classical Orowan bowing.

We study stochastic thermodynamics of Brownian motion in a temperature
gradient. Using the covariant formulation of over-damped Ito-Langevin theory
and the associated Fokker-Planck theory, we construct excess entropy production
both at trajectory level and at ensemble level, and relate it to the log-ratio
between path probabilities of the forward process and the backward process. We
prove both a second-law like inequality and transient fluctuation theorem for
the excess entropy production. We also simulate a Brownian particle inside a
Lennard-Jones fluid and find that the fluctuation theorem is valid both in the
over-damped regime and in the under-damped regime.

<h3>United v.s. Divided, Deconfinement of Social Tension as a Topological  Phase Transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
The proverbs "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" and alike capture the
essence of many body correlations in social relations, whose violation leads to
social tension. We study how rule-breakers, who disrespect these norms, affect
the structure and dynamics of signed social networks which tries to minimize
social tension. We find two dynamic phases. A friendly society exhibits a
"united phase" where insertion of a rule-breaker only leads to localized
rearrangement. A hostile society exhibits a "divided phase", where insertion
leads to macroscopic reorganization of social relations. In the divided phase,
starting from the utopia state, where all relations are friendly, insertion of
a {\em separatist}, a particular type of rule-breaker who makes friends with
only half of its neighbors, leads to fragmentation, where the society breaks
into many finite size, mutually antagonistic cliques. These phenomena are
described by Ising lattice gauge theory, where social tension behave as $Z_2$
topological defects, which are confined in the united phase and deconfined in
the divided phase. We further show that the connection between social dynamics
and Ising lattice gauge theory is viable independently of connectivity
structure of the social network.

<h3>Exploring GaN crystallographic orientation disparity and its origin on  bare and partly graphene-covered $m$-plane sapphire substrates</h3>

<br>
<br>
The crystallographic orientation of 3D materials grown over 2D
material-covered substrates is one of the critical factors in discerning the
true growth mechanism among competing possibilities, including remote epitaxy,
van der Waals epitaxy, and pinhole-seeded lateral epitaxy also known as
thru-hole epitaxy. However, definitive identification demands meticulous
investigation to accurately interpret experimentally observed crystallographic
orientations, as misinterpretation can lead to mistaken conclusions regarding
the underlying growth mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that GaN domains
exhibit orientation disparities when grown on both bare and partly
graphene-covered $m$-plane sapphire substrates. Comprehensive measurements of
crystallographic orientation unambiguously reveal that GaN domains adopt (100)
and (103) orientations even when grown under identical growth conditions on
bare and partly graphene-covered $m$-plane sapphire substrates, respectively.
Particularly, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy unequivocally
establishes that GaN grown over partly graphene-covered $m$-plane sapphire
substrates started to nucleate on the exposed sapphire surface. Our research
elucidates that crystallographic orientation disparities can arise even from
thru-hole epitaxy, challenging the commonly accepted notion that such
disparities cannot be attributed to thru-hole epitaxy when grown under
identical growth conditions.

<h3>Fermi level depinning via insertion of a graphene buffer layer at the  gold-2D tin monoxide contact</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15820</a>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) tin monoxide (SnO) has attracted much attention owing to
its distinctive electronic and optical properties, which render itself suitable
as a channel material in field effect transistors (FETs). However, upon contact
with metals for such applications, the Fermi level pinning effect may occur,
where states are induced in its band gap by the metal, hindering its intrinsic
semiconducting properties. We propose the insertion of graphene at the contact
interface to alleviate the metal-induced gap states. By using gold (Au) as the
electrode material and monolayer SnO (mSnO) as the channel material, the
geometry, bonding strength, charge transfer and tunnel barriers of charges, and
electronic properties including the work function, band structure, density of
states, and Schottky barriers are thoroughly investigated using
first-principles calculations for the structures with and without graphene to
reveal the contact behaviours and Fermi level depinning mechanism. It has been
demonstrated that strong covalent bonding is formed between gold and mSnO,
while the graphene interlayer forms weak van der Waals interaction with both
materials, which minimises the perturbance to the band structure of mSnO. The
effects of out-of-plane compression are also analysed to assess the performance
of the contact under mechanical deformation, and a feasible fabrication route
for the heterostructure with graphene is proposed. This work systematically
explores the properties of the Au-mSnO contact for applications in FETs and
provides thorough guidance for future exploitation of 2D materials in various
electronic applications and for selection of buffer layers to improve
metal-semiconductor contact.

Here we report the TiVNbTa medium-entropy alloy (MEA) superconductor with the
mixed 3d - 5d elements synthesized by an arc-melting method. The TiVNbTa
material has a body-centered cubic structure. The superconducting properties of
TiVNbTa were studied by resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat
measurements. The experimental results show that the bulk superconducting phase
transition temperature of TiVNbTa is about 4.65 K, and the upper and lower
critical fields are 49.3(4) mT and 5.9(5) T, respectively, which indicates
TiVNbTa is a type-II superconductor. First-principles calculations show that
the d electrons of Ti, V, Nb, and Ta atoms play a significant role near the
Fermi level. The results show TiVNbTa is a traditional s-wave superconductor.

<h3>Anomalous scaling corrections and quantum phase diagram of the  Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the spatially anisotropic honeycomb lattice</h3>

<br>

Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the ground
state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the
honeycomb lattice for the most generic case of three varying interaction
strengths along the different lattice directions. We identify continuous
quantum phase transition lines that separate the long-range ordered
antiferromagnetic regime from three distinct quantum-disordered phases, each
characterized by dominant dimer-singlet formations. The finite-size behavior
along these phase transition lines exhibits anomalously large corrections to
scaling, which we relate to similar recent findings in certain dimerized
quantum spin systems and to singular one-dimensional limits in the model
parameter space. We also comment more generally on the non-universality of
critical cumulant ratios in anisotropic systems and attempts to restore
universality by varying the aspect ratio.

<h3>Machine-Learning-Assisted Construction of Ternary Convex Hull Diagrams</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
In the search for novel intermetallic ternary alloys, much of the effort goes
into performing a large number of ab-initio calculations covering a wide range
of compositions and structures. These are essential to build a reliable convex
hull diagram. While density functional theory (DFT) provides accurate
predictions for many systems, its computational overheads set a throughput
limit on the number of hypothetical phases that can be probed. Here, we
demonstrate how an ensemble of machine-learning spectral neighbor-analysis
potentials (SNAPs) can be integrated into a workflow for the construction of
accurate ternary convex hull diagrams, highlighting regions fertile for
materials discovery. Our workflow relies on using available binary-alloy data
both to train the SNAP models and to create prototypes for ternary phases. From
the prototype structures, all unique ternary decorations are created and used
to form a pool of candidate compounds. The SNAPs are then used to pre-relax the
structures and screen the most favourable prototypes, before using DFT to build
the final phase diagram. As constructed, the proposed workflow relies on no
extra first-principles data to train the machine-learning surrogate model and
yields a DFT-level accurate convex hull. We demonstrate its efficacy by
investigating the Cu-Ag-Au and Mo-Ta-W ternary systems.

We consider a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) with on-site
double-well potentials and study the effect of nearest-neighbor repulsion and
cavity-mediated long-range interactions by calculating the ground-state phase
diagrams with quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that when the intra-well
repulsion is as strong as the on-site repulsion a dimerized Mott insulator
phase appears at the tip of the dimerized Density Wave phase for a density of
one particle per double well. Furthermore, we find a dimerized Haldane
insulator phase in the double-well BHM with nearest-neighbor interaction, which
is identical to a dimerized BHM with repulsive interactions up to the third
neighbor.

In situ interfacial rheology and numerical simulations are used to
investigate microgel monolayers in a wide range of packing fractions,
$\zeta_{2D}$. The heterogeneous particle compressibility determines two flow
regimes characterized by distinct master curves. To mimic the microgel
architecture and reproduce experiments, a potential combining a soft shoulder
with the Hertzian model is introduced. In contrast to bulk conditions, the
measured elastic moduli vary non-monotonically with $\zeta_{2D}$ at the
interface, confirming long-sought predictions of reentrant behavior for
Hertzian-like systems.

<h3>Quantum Plasmons in Double Layer Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15937</a>
<br>
<i>Luis Brey, H.A.Fertig</i>
<br>
<br>
Plasmons are fundamental excitations of metals which can be described in
terms of electron dynamics, or in terms of the electromagnetic fields
associated with them. In this work we develop a quantum description of plasmons
in a double layer structure, treating them as confined electromagnetic modes of
the structure. The structure of the resulting bosonic Hamiltonian indicates the
presence of virtual plasmons of the individual layers which appear as quantum
fluctuations in the ground state. For momenta smaller than the inverse
separation between layers, these modes are in the ultrastrong coupling regime.
Coherence terms in the Hamiltonian indicate that modes with equal and opposite
momenta are entangled. We consider how in principle these entangled modes might
be accessed, by analyzing a situation in which the conductivity of one of the
two layers suddenly drops to zero. The resulting density matrix has a large
entanglement entropy at small momenta, and modes at $\pm \mathbf{q}$ that are
inseparable. More practical routes to releasing and detecting entangled
plasmons from this system are considered.

<h3>Mechanism of cathodic protection of iron and steel in porous media</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cathodic protection (CP) was introduced two centuries ago and since has found
widespread application in protecting structures such as pipelines, offshore
installations, and bridges from corrosion. Despite its extensive use, the
fundamental working mechanism of CP remains debated, particularly for metals in
porous media such as soil. Here, we offer resolution to the long-standing
debate by employing in-situ and ex-situ characterisation techniques coupled
with electrochemical measurements to characterise the spatio-temporal changes
occurring at the steel-electrolyte interface. We show that upon CP, the
interfacial electrolyte undergoes alkalinisation and deoxygenation, and that
depending on polarisation conditions, an iron oxide film can simultaneously
form on the steel surface. We further demonstrate that these changes in
interfacial electrolyte chemistry and steel surface state result in altered
anodic and cathodic reactions and their kinetics. We propose a mechanism of CP
that integrates the long debated theories, based on both concentration and
activation polarisation, complimentarily. Implications of this coherent
scientific understanding for enhancing corrosion protection technologies and
the safe, economic, and environmental-friendly operation of critical
steel-based infrastructures are discussed.

We propose a polariton-moir\'e coupled system to realize an exact solvable
model of strongly correlated superconductors. The polariton condensate induces
intervalley attraction between moir\'e electrons in quasi-flat topological
bands, leading to emergent SU(2) symmetry and exactly solutions of the
many-body ground state. This system expands the condensate-induced
superconductivity to the strong-correlation regime, enabling superconductivity
at elevated temperatures and allowing the study of non-Fermi liquid states with
a solvable, predictive model. It is promising as a versatile platform for
emulating unconventional superconductivity and other strongly correlated
phenomena in complex, correlated materials.

Quantum dots exhibit a variety of strongly correlated effects, e.g., when
tuned to emulate localized magnetic impurities that form a Kondo singlet with
their surrounding environment. Interestingly, in double-dots setups, the
magnetic impurities couple to each other by direct
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which wins over the Kondo
physics. In this work, we investigate a double-dot device where the dots are
coupled via off-resonant ballistic whispering gallery modes, dubbed electronic
cavity modes. Within this cavity-double-dot system, we study, using variational
matrix product state techniques, the competition between Kondo formation and
the coherent RKKY-like interaction that the cavity facilitates. Specifically,
we find that (i) Kondo can win and form on each dot individually, or (ii) the
cavity can win and mediate between the two dots either a singlet or a novel
nonlocal Kondo-like effect phase, which we call "cat Kondo". We systematically
study the quantum phase transitions between the different many-body states. Our
discoveries lay the foundation for the experimental observation of
unconventional nonlocal magnetic impurities.

When a colloidal probe is forced through a viscoelastic fluid which is
characterized by a long stress-relaxation time, the fluid is excited out of
equilibrium. This is leading to a number of interesting effects including a
non-trivial recoil of the probe when the driving force is removed. Here, we
experimentally and theoretically investigate the transient recoil dynamics of
non-spherical particles, i.e., colloidal dumbbells. In addition to a
translational recoil of the dumbbells, we also find a pronounced angular
reorientation which results from the relaxation of the surrounding fluid. Our
findings are in good agreement with a Langevin description based on the
symmetries of a director (dumbbell) as well as a microscopic bath-rod model.
Remarkably, we find a frustrated state with amplified fluctuations when the
dumbbell is oriented perpendicular to the direction of driving. Our results
demonstrate the complex behavior of non-spherical objects within a relaxing
environment which are of immediate interest for the motion of externally but
also self-driven asymmetric objects in viscoelastic fluids.

Manganite perovskites host emerging physical properties of

freedom. Using epitaxial lift-off technique, we report enhancement of
saturation magnetization and ferromagnetic transition temperature of the
freestanding La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 membrane compared with the as-grown film on SrTiO3
substrate involving lateral tensile strain. Structural analysis reveals
shrinkage of unit-cell volume by tensile strain relaxation in the freestanding
membrane, which causes enhancement of the ferromagnetic interaction. The impact
of the microscopic lattice deformation on the ferromagnetism of La2/3Sr1/3MnO3
indicates a high potential of this material for flexible electronics
application with intriguing functionalities in strongly-correlated electron

<h3>Chemical heterogeneity enhances hydrogen resistance in high-strength  steels</h3>

<br>
<br>
When H, the lightest, smallest and most abundant atom in the universe, makes
its way into a high-strength alloy (>650 MPa), the material's load-bearing
capacity is abruptly lost. This phenomenon, known as H embrittlement, was
responsible for the catastrophic and unpredictable failure of large engineering
structures in service. The inherent antagonism between high strength
requirements and H embrittlement susceptibility strongly hinders the design of
lightweight yet reliable structural components needed for carbon-free
hydrogen-propelled industries and reduced-emission transportation solutions.
Inexpensive and scalable alloying and microstructural solutions that enable
both, an intrinsically high resilience to H and high mechanical performance,
must be found. Here we introduce a counterintuitive strategy to exploit
typically undesired chemical heterogeneity within the material's microstructure
that allows the local enhancement of crack resistance and local H trapping,
thereby enhancing the resistance against H embrittlement. We deploy this
approach to a lightweight, high-strength steel and produce a high-number
density Mn-rich zones dispersed within the microstructure. These solute-rich
buffer regions allow for local micro-tuning of the phase stability, arresting
H-induced microcracks thus interrupting the H-assisted damage evolution chain,
regardless of how and when H is introduced and also regardless of the
underlying embrittling mechanisms. A superior H embrittlement resistance,
increased by a factor of two compared to a reference material with a
homogeneous solute distribution within each microstructure constituent, is
achieved at no expense of the material's strength and ductility.

Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY)-based materials represent an intriguing
class of two-dimensional (2D) carbon-rich networks with tunable structures and
properties surpassing those of graphene. However, the challenge of fabricating
atomically well-defined crystalline GY/GDY-based systems largely hinders
detailed electronic structure characterizations. Here, we report the emergence
of an unconventional band structure in mesoscopically regular (~1 {\mu}m)
metallated GDY sheets featuring a honeycomb lattice on Ag(111) substrates.
Employing complementary scanning tunnelling and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopies, electronic band formation with a gap of 2.5 eV is rigorously
determined in agreement with real-space electronic characteristics. Extensive
density functional theory calculations corroborate our observations as well as
recent theoretical predictions that doubly degenerate frontier molecular
orbitals on a honeycomb lattice give rise to flat, Dirac and Kagome bands close
to Fermi level. These results illustrate the tremendous potential of
engineering novel band structures via molecular orbital and lattice symmetries
in atomically precise 2D carbon scaffolds.

We observe spin rotations caused by atomic collisions in a non-equilibrium
Bose-condensed gas of $^{87}$Rb. Reflection from a pseudomagnetic barrier
creates counterflow in which forward- and backward-propagating matter waves
have partly transverse spin directions. Even though inter-atomic interaction
strengths are state-independent, the indistinguishability of parallel spins
leads to spin dynamics. A local magnetodynamic model, which captures the
salient features of the observed spin textures, highlights an essential
connection between four-wave mixing and collisional spin rotation. The observed
phenomenon has previously been thought to exist only in nondegenerate gases;
our observations and model clarify the nature of these effective-magnetic spin
rotations.

Piezoelectricity of organic polymers has attracted increasing interest
because of several advantages they exhibit over traditional inorganic ceramics.
While most organic piezoelectrics rely on the presence of intrinsic local
dipoles, a highly nonlocal electronic polarization can be foreseen in
conjugated polymers, characterised by delocalized and highly responsive
${\pi}$-electrons. These 1D systems represent a physical realization of a
Thouless pump, a mechanism of adiabatic charge transport of topological nature
which results, as shown in this work, in anomalously large dynamical effective
charges, inversely proportional to the band gap energy. A structural
(ferroelectric) phase transition further contributes to an enhancement of the
piezoelectric response reminiscent of that observed in piezoelectric
perovskites close to morphotropic phase boundaries. First-principles Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed in two representative conjugated
polymers using hybrid functionals, show that state-of-the-art organic
piezoelectric are outperformed by piezoelectric conjugated polymers, mostly
thanks to strongly anomalous effective charges of carbon, larger than 5e -
ordinary values being of the order of 1e - and reaching the giant value of 30e
for band gaps of the order of 1 eV.

Schmid transition was introduced first as a superconductor-insulator
transition in the zero-frequency response of a shunted Josephson junction in
equilibrium at zero temperature. As it is typical for a quantum impurity
problem, at finite frequencies the transition is broadened to a crossover.
Modern attempts to find Schmid transition rely on finite-frequency measurements
of a quantum circuit. We predict the frequency dependence of the admittance and
reflection phase shift for a high-impedance transmission line terminated by a
Josephson junction for a wide variety of devices, from a charge qubit to a
transmon. Our results identify the circuit parameters allowing for the
universal scaling of the responses with frequency, thus helping to identify the
Schmid transition from the finite-frequency measurements.

In a recent work [Reible {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Res. {\bf 5}, 023156, 2023],
it has been shown that the mean particle-particle interaction across an ideal
surface that divides a system into two parts, can be employed to estimate the
size dependence for the thermodynamic accuracy of the system. In this work we
propose its application to systems with short range interactions that models a
dense quantum gases and derive an approximate size-dependence scaling law. In
addition, we show that the application of the criterion is equivalent to the
determination of a free energy response to a perturbation. The latter result
comfirms the complementarity of the criterion to other estimates of finite-size
effects based on direct simulations and empirical structure or energy
convergence criteria.

This study describes computer simulations of carbonization and graphite
formation, including the effects of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. We
introduce a novel technique to simulate carbonization, "Simulation of Thermal
Emission of Atoms and Molecules (STEAM)," designed to elucidate the removal of
volatiles and density variations in carbonization residue. The investigation
extensively analyzes the functional groups that endure through high-temperature
carbonization and examines the graphitization processes in carbon-rich
materials containing non-carbon "impurity elements". The physical, vibrational,
and electronic attributes of impure amorphous graphite are analyzed, and the
impact of nitrogen on electronic conduction is investigated, revealing its
substitutional integration into the sp$^2$ layered network.

Majorana bound states (MBSs) are building blocks for topological quantum
computing. They can be generated via the combination of electronic topology and
superconductivity. To achieve logic operations via Majorana braiding,
positional control of the MBS must be established. To this end, exotic
co-existing phases or collective modes in an intrinsic topological
superconductor can provide a tuning knob to manipulate the MBS. Here we report
the observation of a striped surface charge order coexisting with
superconductivity and its controllable tuning of the MBS in the topological
superconductor 2M-WS2 using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By
applying an out-of-plane magnetic field, we observe that MBS is absent in
vortices in the region with strong stripe order. This is in contrast to
adjacent underlaying layers without charge order where vortex-bound MBSs are
observed. Via theoretical simulations, we show that the surface stripe order
does not destroy the bulk topology, but it can effectively modify the spatial
distribution of MBS, i.e., it pushes them downward away from the 2M-WS2
surface. Our findings demonstrate that the interplay of charge order and
topological superconductivity can be used to manipulate the positions of the
MBS, and to explore of new states of matter.

<h3>Strengthening from dislocation restructuring and local climb at platelet  linear complexions in Al-Cu alloys</h3>

Stress-driven segregation at dislocations can lead to structural transitions
between different linear complexion states. In this work, we examine how
platelet array linear complexions influence dislocation motion and quantify the
associated strengthening effect in Al-Cu alloys using atomistic simulations.
The presence of platelet complexions leads to faceting of the dislocations,
with nanoscale segments climbing upwards along the platelet growth direction,
resulting in a complex non-planar configuration that restricts subsequent
dislocation motion. Upon deformation, the leading partial dislocation must
climb down from the platelet complexions first, followed by a similar sequence
at the trailing partial dislocation, in order to overcome the precipitates and
commence plastic slip. The dislocation depinning mechanism of linear
complexions is strikingly different from traditional precipitation-strengthened
alloys, where dislocations overcome obstacles by either shearing through or
looping around obstacles. The critical shear stress required to unpin
dislocations from platelet complexions is found to be inversely proportional to
precipitate spacing, which includes not just the open space (as observed in
Orowan bowing) but also the region along the platelet particle where climb
occurs. Thus, platelet linear complexions provide a new way to modify
dislocation structure directly and improve the mechanical properties of metal
alloys.

Here we present the family of titanium-based kagome metals of the form
LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ (Ln: La...Gd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{2+}$, Yb$^{2+}$). Single crystal
growth methods are presented alongside detailed magnetic and thermodynamic
measurements. The orthorhombic (\textit{Fmmm}) LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ family of
compounds exhibit slightly distorted titanium-based kagome nets interwoven with
zig-zag lanthanide-based (Ln) chains. Crystals are easily exfoliated parallel
to the kagome sheets and angular resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements
highlight the intricacy of the electronic structure in these compounds, with
Dirac points existing at the Fermi level. The magnetic properties and the
associated anisotropy emerge from the quasi-1D zig-zag chains of Ln, and impart
a wide array of magnetic ground states ranging from anisotropic ferromagnetism
to complex antiferromagnetism with a cascade of metamagnetic transitions.
Kagome metals continue to provide a rich direction for the exploration of
magnetic, topologic, and highly correlated behavior. Our work here introduces
the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ compounds to augment the continuously expanding suite of
complex and interesting kagome materials.

Dispersed impurities in diamond present a flourishing platform for research
in quantum informatics, spintronics and single phonon emitters. Based on the
vast pool of experimental and theoretical work describing impurity atoms in
diamond, we review the configurations by the chemical element discussing the
relevant atomic configurations and most important properties. Dopant structures
expand from single to co-doping configurations, also combined with carbon
vacancies. Despite of their importance, not much is known about the exact
atomic configurations associated with the dopant structures beyond
computational models, partially due to difficulties in their microscopic
observation. To assess the visibility of these structures, we carry out image
simulations to show that the heavier dopants may be easily discernible in
scanning transmission electron microscopy annular dark field images, with a
window of visibility of up to over $\pm$ 10 nm in defocus. We further present
the first atomic resolution images of an impurity atom configuration
(substitutional Er atom) in the diamond lattice, confirmed by a comparison to
the simulated images. Overall, our results demonstrate that there is a vast
research field waiting for the microscopy community in resolving the exact
atomic structure of various impurity atom configurations in diamond.

We present a generalization of AEMD approach, routinely applied to estimate
thermal conductivity, to the more general case in which Soret and Dufour
effects determine a coupled heat-mass transfer. We show that, by starting from
microscopical definitions of heat and mass currents, conservation laws dictates
the form of the differential equations governing the time evolution. In
particular, we focus to the well specific case in which a closed-form solution
of the system is possible and derive the analytical form of time-evolution of
temperature and concentration scalar fields in the case in which step-like
initial profiles are imposed across a rectangular simulation cell. The validity
of this new generalized expression is finally validated using as benchamrk
system a two-component Lennard-Jones liquid system, for which generalized
diffusivities are estimated in different reduced temperature and density region
of phase diagram.

Segregation engineering has emerged as a promising pathway towards designing
thermally stable nanocrystalline alloys with enhanced mechanical properties.
However, the compositional and processing space for solute stabilized
microstructures is vast, thus the application of high-throughput techniques to
accelerate optimal material development is increasingly attractive. In this
work, combinatorial synthesis is combined with high-throughput characterization
techniques to explore microstructural transitions through annealing of a
nanocrystalline ternary Al-base alloy containing a transition metal (TM=Ni) and
rare earth dopant (RE=Y). A down-selected optimal composition with the highest
thermal stability is annealed through in situ transmission electron microscopy,
revealing that the removal of the RE species is correlated to a reduction in
the microstructural stability at high temperatures as a result of variations in
intermetallic phase formation. Results demonstrate the benefits of
co-segregation for enhancing mechanical hardness and delaying the onset of
microstructural instability.
