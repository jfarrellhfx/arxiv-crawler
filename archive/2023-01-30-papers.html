<h3>Introduction to the Fifth-rung Density Functional Approximations:  Concept, Formulation, and Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12119" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12119</a>
<br>
<i>Igor Ying Zhang, Xinguo Ren</i>
<br>
<br>
The widespread use of (generalized) Kohn-Sham density functional theory
(KS-DFT) lies in the fact that hierarchical sets of approximations of the
exchange-correlation (XC) energy functional can be designed, offering versatile
choices to satisfy different levels of accuracy needs. The XC functionals
standing on the fifth (top) rung of the Jacob's ladder incorporate the
information of unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals, and by doing so can describe
seamlessly non-local electron correlations that the lower-rung functionals fail
to capture. The doubly hybrid approximations (DHAs) and random phase
approximation (RPA) based methods are two representative classes of fifth-rung
functionals that have been under active development over the past two decades.
In this review, we recapitulate the basic concepts of DHAs and RPA, derive
their underlying theoretical formulation from the perspective of
adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theory, and describe the
implementation algorithms based on the resolution-of-identity technique within
an atomic-orbital basis-set framework. Illustrating examples of practical
applications of DHAs and RPA are presented, highlighting the usefulness of
these functionals in resolving challenging problems in computational materials
science. The most recent advances in the realms of these two types of
functionals are briefly discussed.

<h3>Towards a liquid-state theory for active matter</h3>

In equilibrium, the collective behaviour of particles interacting via steep,
short-ranged potentials is well captured by the virial expansion of the free
energy at low density. Here, we extend this approach beyond equilibrium to the
case of active matter with self-propelled particles. Given that active systems
do not admit any free-energy description in general, our aim is to build the
dynamics of the coarse-grained density from first principles without any
equilibrium assumption. Starting from microscopic equations of motion, we
obtain the hierarchy of density correlations, which we close with an ansatz for
the two-point density valid in the dilute regime at small activity. This
closure yields the nonlinear dynamics of the one-point density, with
hydrodynamic coefficients depending explicitly on microscopic interactions, by
analogy with the equilibrium virial expansion. This dynamics admits a spinodal
instability for purely repulsive interactions, a signature of motility-induced
phase separation. Therefore, although our approach should be restricted to
dilute, weakly-active systems a priori, it actually captures the features of a
broader class of active matter.

<h3>Dynamics of imbalanced quasi-one-dimensional binary Bose-Einstein  condensate in external potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12220" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12220</a>
<br>
<i>K. K. Ismailov, B. B. Baizakov, F. Kh. Abdullaev, M. Salerno</i>
<br>
<br>
In the framework of coupled 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equations, we explore the
dynamics of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate where the intra-component
interaction is repulsive, while the inter-component one is attractive. The
existence regimes of stable self-trapped localized states in the form of
symbiotic solitons have been analyzed. Imbalanced mixtures, where the number of
atoms in one component exceeds the number of atoms in the other component, are
considered in parabolic potential and box-like trap. When all the intra-species
and inter-species interactions are repulsive, we numerically find a new type of
symbiotic solitons resembling dark-bright solitons. A variational approach has
been developed which allows us to find the stationary state of the system and
frequency of small amplitude dynamics near the equilibrium. It is shown that
the strength of inter-component coupling can be retrieved from the frequency of
the localized state's vibrations.

<h3>Corbino magnetoresistance in neutral graphene</h3>

We explore magnetohydrodynamics of Dirac fermions in neutral graphene in the
Corbino geometry. Based on the fully consistent hydrodynamic description
derived from a microscopic framework and taking into account all peculiarities
of graphene-specific hydrodynamics, we report results of a comprehensive study
of the interplay of viscosity, disorder-induced scattering, recombination,
energy relaxation, and interface-induced dissipation. In the clean limit,
magnetoresistance of a Corbino sample is determined by viscosity. Hence the
Corbino geometry could be used to measure the viscosity coefficient in neutral
graphene.

<h3>Three-Dimensional Low-Density Fermions in Planckian Limit: Entropy and  Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12657" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12657</a>
<br>
<i>Shao-Jian Jiang, Fei Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
In this Letter, we explore dynamics in a three-dimensional strongly
interacting liquid. In quantum liquids discussed below, thermodynamic
properties such as pressure and thermal energies are fully characterized by
$s(T)$, the entropy density of the liquid (that is also directly proportional
to the hydrodynamic viscosity). We obtain a universal fermion spectral function
$A(\omega, {\bf k})$ that is distinctly specified by $\hbar / T$, a Planckian
time scale. These phenomena can emerge in strongly interacting many-body states
with a finite fermion density $\rho$ at temperatures $T^*$ where the chemical
potential of fermions $\mu(\rho, T=T^*)$ approaches zero and can be thought as
many-body simulations of certain aspects of Planckian dynamics.

<h3>Necking and failure of a colloidal gel arm: signatures of yielding on  different length scales</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12735" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12735</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Colloidal gels consist of percolating networks of interconnected arms. Their
mechanical properties depend on the individual arms, and on their collective
behaviour. We use numerical simulations to pull on a single arm, built from a
model colloidal gel-former with short-ranged attractive interactions. Under
elongation, the arm breaks by a necking instability. We analyse this behaviour
at three different length scales: a rheological continuum model of the whole
arm; a microscopic analysis of the particle structure and dynamics; and the
local stress tensor. Combining these different measurements gives a coherent
picture of the necking and failure: the neck is characterised by plastic flow
that occurs for stresses close to the arm's yield stress. The arm has an
amorphous local structure and has large residual stresses from its
initialisation. We find that neck formation is associated with increased
plastic flow, a reduction in the stability of the local structure, and a
reduction in the residual stresses; this indicates that {the} system loses its
solid character and starts to behave more like a viscous fluid. We discuss the
implications of these results for the modelling of gel dynamics.

<h3>Temporal response of the conductivity of electrolytes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12871</a>
<br>
<i>Haggai Bonneau, Vincent Démery, Élie Raphaël</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the temporal response of the electric current in an electrolyte
under a sudden switch on or switch off of an external electric field of
arbitrary magnitude. We use Stochastic Density Functional Theory including
hydrodynamic interactions to express the current as a function of the ionic
correlations. Assuming small density fluctuations, we linearize the field
theory to compute the correlations in the transient regime. We first show that
the correlations do not follow the same trajectory when the field is switched
on or switched off. Accordingly, the behavior of the current differs in the two
cases: it decays exponentially when the field is switched off, but it relaxes
algebraically to its stationnary value when the field is switched on. This
difference is a non-linear effect since an exponential relaxation is recovered
in both cases in the weak field limit.

<h3>Network physics of attractive colloidal gels: Resilience, Rigidity, and  Phase Diagram</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13027" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13027</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Nabizadeh, Farzaneh Nasirian, Xinzhi Li, Yug Saraswat, Rony Waheibi, Lilian C. Hsiao, Dapeng Bi, Babak Ravandi, Safa Jamali</i>
<br>
<br>
Attractive colloidal gels exhibit solid-like behavior at vanishingly small
fractions of solids, owing to ramified space-spanning networks that form due to
particle-particle interactions. These networks give the gel its rigidity, and
as the attraction between the particles grows, so does the elasticity of the
colloidal network formed. The emergence of this rigidity can be described
through a mean field approach; nonetheless, fundamental understanding of how
rigidity varies in gels of different attraction strengths is lacking. Moreover,
recovering an accurate gelation phase diagram based on the system's variables
have been an extremely challenging task. Understanding the nature of these
fractal clusters, and how rigidity emerges from their connections is key to
controlling and designing gels with desirable properties. Here, we employ
well-established concepts of network science to interrogate and characterize
the network of colloidal gels. We construct a particle-level network, having
all the spatial coordinates of colloids with different attraction levels, and
also identify polydisperse rigid fractal clusters using a Gaussian Mixture
Model, to form a coarse-grained cluster network that distinctly shows main
physical features of the colloidal gels. A simple mass-spring model then is
used to recover quantitatively the elasticity of colloidal gels from these
cluster networks. Interrogating the resilience of these gel networks show that
the elasticity of a gel (a dynamic property) is directly correlated to its
cluster network's resilience (a static measure). Finally, we use the resilience
investigations to devise [and experimentally validate] a fully resolved phase
diagram for colloidal gelation, with a clear solid-liquid phase boundary using
a single volume fraction of particles well beyond this phase boundary.

<h3>Light, Matter, Action: Shining light on active matter</h3>

Light carries energy and momentum. It can therefore alter the motion of
objects from atomic to astronomical scales. Being widely available, readily
controllable and broadly biocompatible, light is also an ideal tool to propel
microscopic particles, drive them out of thermodynamic equilibrium and make
them active. Thus, light-driven particles have become a recent focus of
research in the field of soft active matter. In this perspective, we discuss
recent advances in the control of soft active matter with light, which has
mainly been achieved using light intensity. We also highlight some first
attempts to utilize light's additional degrees of freedom, such as its
wavelength, polarization, and momentum. We then argue that fully exploiting
light with all of its properties will play a critical role to increase the
level of control over the actuation of active matter as well as the flow of
light itself through it. This enabling step will advance the design of soft
active matter systems, their functionalities and their transfer towards
technological applications.

<h3>Theoretical model of membrane protrusions driven by curved active  proteins</h3>

Eukaryotic cells intrinsically change their shape, by changing the
composition of their membrane and by restructuring their underlying
cytoskeleton. We present here further studies and extensions of a minimal
physical model, describing a closed vesicle with mobile curved membrane protein
complexes. The cytoskeletal forces describe the protrusive force due to actin
polymerization which is recruited to the membrane by the curved protein
complexes. We characterize the phase diagrams of this model, as function of the
magnitude of the active forces, nearest-neighbor protein interactions and the
proteins' spontaneous curvature. It was previously shown that this model can
explain the formation of lamellipodia-like flat protrusions, and here we
explore the regimes where the model can also give rise to filopodia-like
tubular protrusions. We extend the simulation with curved components of both
convex and concave species, where we find the formation of complex ruffled
clusters, as well as internalized invaginations that resemble the process of
endocytosis and macropinocytosis. We alter the force model representing the
cytoskeleton to simulate the effects of bundled instead of branched structure,
resulting in shapes which resemble filopodia.

<h3>Effect of transverse confinement on a quasi-one dimensional dipolar Bose  gas</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a gas of bosonic dipolar atoms in the presence of a transverse
harmonic trapping potential by using an improved variational Bethe ansatz,
which includes the transverse width of the atomic cloud as a variational
parameter. Our calculations show that the system behavior evolves from
quasi-one dimensional to a strictly one-dimensional one by changing the
atom-atom interaction, or the axial density, or the frequency of the transverse
confinement. Quite remarkably, in the droplet phase induced by the attractive
dipolar interaction the system becomes sub-one dimensional when the transverse
width is smaller than the characteristic length of the transverse harmonic
confinement.

<h3>Viscoelastic response of an active particle under the action of magnetic  field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13179" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13179</a>
<br>
<i>M Muhsin, F Adersh, M. Sahoo</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the dynamics of a charged inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
particle in a viscoelastic suspension under the action of an uniform magnetic
field. With the help of both numerical simulation and analytical framework, we
exactly investigate the viscoelastic response of the particle to the magnetic
field by means of particle trajectories, mean displacement, and mean square
displacement (MSD) calculations. The simulated particle trajectories and MSD
calculations reveal that the steady state response of a confined harmonic
particle to the magnetic field show interesting features due to the complex
interplay of underlying physical processes such as elastic dissipation and
active fluctuations in the medium. When the activity time scale of the dynamics
is larger than the elastic dissipation timescale (or vice-versa), the steady
state MSD shows an enhancement (or suppression) with increase in the field
strength. In both the cases, for very strong magnetic field the MSD
interestingly approaches the value at the equilibrium limit where the
generalized fluctuation dissipation relation is satisfied and the particle
behaves like an inertial passive Brownian particle. Thus, for a finite magnetic
field, the system exhibits a re-entrant type transition from active to passive
and then to active behaviour with persistence of elastic dissipation in the
medium. However, for a free particle, the overall displacement covered always
gets suppressed with increase in the strength of the magnetic field and finally
approaches zero for a very strong magnetic field.

<h3>Machine learning assisted discovery of exotic criticality in a planar  quasicrystal</h3>

Our understanding of universality and phase transitions is deeply rooted in
the notion of scaling. Indeed continuous phase transitions typically exhibit
scale-invariant behavior facilitating the use of standard renormalization group
(RG) techniques. Some critical systems, however, evade full scale invariance,
in that observables reproduce themselves only under a set of discrete scale
factors $\delta^n$. Such discrete scale invariance (DSI) presents a conceptual
challenge as many of our theoretical tools fail to be directly applicable.
Here, we report on a discovery of emergent degrees of freedom for the recently
studied classical dimer model on the quasiperiodic Ammann-Beenker tiling. Using
a machine learning assisted approach we establish that their statistics can be
expressed in terms of emergent large-scale super-dimers. Moreover, the result
reveals an emergent discrete scale invariance, where the same dimer problem is
re-appearing at successive discrete coarse-grained levels, demonstrating
proximity to an RG fixed point. Our findings not only provide a rare example of
successfully applying RG to a strongly-correlated system on a two-dimensional
quasicrystal, but, owing to the generality of the approach, delineate a new
paradigm in analysis and a practical tool for discovering coarse-grained
representations in quasiperiodic and other non-homogeneous systems.

<h3>Phonon-induced localization of excitons in molecular crystals from first  principles</h3>

The spatial extent of excitons in molecular systems underpins their
photophysics and utility for optoelectronic applications. Phonons are reported
to lead to both exciton localization and delocalization. However, a microscopic
understanding of phonon-induced (de)localization is lacking, in particular how
localized states form, the role of specific vibrations, and the relative
importance of quantum and thermal nuclear fluctuations. Here we present a
first-principles study of these phenomena in solid pentacene, a prototypical
molecular crystal, capturing the formation of bound excitons, exciton-phonon
coupling to all orders, and phonon anharmonicity, using density functional
theory, the \emph{ab initio} $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, finite
difference, and path integral techniques. We find that for pentacene zero-point
nuclear motion causes uniformly strong localization, with thermal motion
providing additional localization only for Wannier-Mott-like excitons.
Anharmonic effects drive temperature-dependent localization, and while such
effects prevent the emergence of highly delocalized excitons, we explore the
conditions under which these might be realized.

<h3>Pseudo-Goldstone modes and dynamical gap generation from  order-by-thermal-disorder</h3>

Accidental ground state degeneracies -- those not a consequence of global
symmetries of the Hamiltonian -- are inevitably lifted by fluctuations, often
leading to long-range order, a phenomenon known as "order-by-disorder" (ObD).
The detection and characterization of ObD in real materials currently lacks
clear, qualitative signatures that distinguish ObD from conventional energetic
selection. We show that for order-by-thermal-disorder (ObTD) such a signature
exists: a characteristic temperature dependence of the fluctuation-induced
pseudo-Goldstone gap. We demonstrate this in a minimal two-dimensional model
that exhibits ObTD, the ferromagnetic Heisenberg-compass model on a square
lattice. Using spin-dynamics simulations and self-consistent mean-field
calculations, we determine the pseudo-Goldstone gap, $\Delta $, and show that
at low temperatures it scales as the square root of temperature, $\sqrt{T} $.
We establish that a power-law temperature dependence of the gap is a general
consequence of ObTD, showing that all key features of this physics can be
captured in a simple model of a particle moving in an effective potential
generated by the fluctuation-induced free energy.

<h3>Magnetic Amplification at Yb3+ "Designer Defects" in the van der Waals  Ferromagnet, CrI3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11949" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11949</a>

<br>
<br>
The two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3 has been doped with
the magnetic optical impurity Yb3+ to yield materials that display sharp
multi-line Yb3+ photoluminescence (PL) controlled by the magnetism of CrI3.
Magneto-PL shows that Yb3+ magnetization is pinned to the magnetization of
CrI3. An effective internal field of ~10 T at Yb3+ is estimated, attributed to
strong in-plane Yb3+-Cr3+ superexchange coupling. The anomalously low energy of
Yb3+ PL in CrI3 reflects relatively high Yb3+-I- covalency, contributing to
Yb3+-Cr3+ superexchange coupling. The Yb3+ PL energy and linewidth both reveal
the effects of spontaneous zero-field CrI3 magnetic ordering within 2D layers
below TC, despite the absence of net magnetization in multilayer samples. These
results illustrate the use of optical impurities as "designer defects" to
introduce unique functionality to 2D magnets.

<h3>Topological structures in unconventional scenario for 2D cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11951" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11951</a>
<br>
<i>A.S. Moskvin, Yu.D. Panov</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a minimal model to describe the charge degree of freedom in
cuprates with the on-site Hilbert space reduced to only the three valence
states CuO$_4^{7-,6-,5-}$ (nominally Cu$^{1+,2+,3+}$) and make use of the S=1
pseudospin formalism. The formalism constitutes a powerful method to study
complex phenomena in interacting quantum systems characterized by the
coexistence and competition of various ordered states. Overall, such a
framework provides a simple and systematic methodology to predict and discover
new kinds of orders. In particular, the pseudospin formalism provides the most
effective way to describe different topological structures, in particular, due
to a possibility of a geometrical two-vector description of the on-site states.
We introduce and analyze effective pseudospin Hamiltonian with on-site and
inter-site charge correlations, two types of a correlated one-particle transfer
and two-particle, or the composite boson transfer. The 2D S=1 pseudospin system
is prone to a creation of different topological structures, which form
topologically protected inhomogeneous distributions of the eight local S=1
pseudospin order parameters. We present a short overview of localized
topological structures, typical for S=1 (pseudo)spin systems, focusing on
unexpected antiphase domain walls in parent cuprates and so-called quadrupole
skyrmion, which are believed to be candidates for a topological charge
excitation in parent or underdoped cuprates. Puzzlingly, these unconventional
structures can be characterized by an uniform distribution of the mean on-site
charge, that makes these invisible for X-rays. Quasiclassical approximation and
computer simulation are applied to analyze localized topological defects and
evolution of the domain structures in "negative-$U$" model under charge
order-superfluid phase transition.

I present a critical overview of so-called "{\it ab initio}" DFT (density
fuctional theory) based calculation schemes for the description of the
electronic structure, energy spectrum, and optical response for strongly
correlated 3$d$ oxides, in particular, crystal-field and charge transfer
transitions as compared with an "old"\, cluster model that does generalize
crystal-field and ligand-field theory. As a most instructive illustration of
validity of numerous calculation techniques I address the prototypical 3$d$

<h3>A semi-analytical model to simulate the spin-diode effect and accelerate  its use in neuromorphic computing</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin-diode effect is studied both experimentally and with our original
semi-analytical method. The latter is based on an improved version of the
Thiele equation approach (TEA) that we combine to micromagnetic simulation data
to accurately model the non-linear dynamics of spin-torque vortex oscillator
(STVO). This original method, called data-driven Thiele equation approach
(DD-TEA), absorbs the difference between the analytical model and micromagnetic
simulations to provide a both ultra-fast and quantitative model. The DD-TEA
model predictions also agree very well with the experimental data. The reversal
of the spin-diode effect with the chirality of the vortex, the impact of the
input current and the origin of a variation at half of the STVO frequency are
presented as well as the ability of the model to reproduce the experimental
behavior. Finally, the spin-diode effect and its simulation using the DD-TEA
model are discussed as a promising perspective in the framework of neuromorphic
computing.

Computational studies of liquid water and its phase transition into vapor
have traditionally been performed using classical water models. Here we utilize
the Deep Potential methodology -- a machine learning approach -- to study this
ubiquitous phase transition, starting from the phase diagram in the
liquid-vapor coexistence regime. The machine learning model is trained on ab
initio energies and forces based on the SCAN density functional which has been
previously shown to reproduce solid phases and other properties of water. Here,
we compute the surface tension, saturation pressure and enthalpy of
vaporization for a range of temperatures spanning from 300 to 600 K, and
evaluate the Deep Potential model performance against experimental results and
the semi-empirical TIP4P/2005 classical model. Moreover, by employing the
seeding technique, we evaluate the free energy barrier and nucleation rate at
negative pressures for the isotherm of 296.4 K. We find that the nucleation
rates obtained from the Deep Potential model deviate from those computed for
the TIP4P/2005 water model, due to an underestimation in the surface tension
from the Deep Potential model. From analysis of the seeding simulations, we
also evaluate the Tolman length for the Deep Potential water model, which is
(0.091 $\pm$ 0.008) nm at 296.4 K. Lastly, we identify that water molecules
display a preferential orientation in the liquid-vapor interface, in which H
atoms tend to point towards the vapor phase to maximize the enthalpic gain of
interfacial molecules. We find that this behaviour is more pronounced for
planar interfaces than for the curved interfaces in bubbles. This work
represents the first application of Deep Potential models to the study of
liquid-vapor coexistence and water cavitation.

Recently discovered kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit
exotic bulk and surface physical properties such as charge-density wave (CDW)
and chirality, whereas their origins remain unresolved. By using micro-focused
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that AV3Sb5 commonly
exhibits two distinct polar surfaces depending on the termination; electron-
and hole-doped ones for the A- and Sb-termination, respectively. We observed
that the kagome-derived band shows a clear splitting in the A-terminated
surface while it is absent in the Sb-terminated counterpart, indicative of the
polarity-dependent CDW at the surface. Close comparison of the band-dependent
splitting reveals that the three-dimensional CDW structure of the K-terminated
surface is different from that of the Rb- or Cs-terminated surface, suggesting
the diversity of the CDW ground state. These results provide important insight
into the origin of CDW in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5.

We study photoinduced dynamics triggered by an inhomogeneity due to
competition between charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity. As a
simple example, we consider the superconducting (SC) interface between two CDW
domains with opposite signs. The real-time dynamics are calculated within the
time-dependent Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov framework, where the order parameter
dynamics and the nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions are
studied. We also calculate the various dynamical response functions within a
generalized random phase approximation. Through comparisons between the real
time dynamics and the analysis of the response functions, it is found that the
photo-driven SC interface can emit collective modes of the SC order parameter.
This is analogous to the spin wave emission from the magnetic domain wall in an
antiferromagnet, particularly in the case of a low driving frequency, where the
order parameters can be mapped onto the pseudospin picture. In the
high-frequency case, we find a domain wall melting caused by changes in the
quasiparticle distribution, which induces superconductivity in the whole
system.

The process of design and discovery of new materials can be significantly
expedited and simplified if we can learn effectively from available data. Deep
learning (DL) approaches have recently received a lot of interest for their
ability to speed up the design of novel materials by predicting material
properties with precision close to experiments and ab-initio calculations. The
application of deep learning to predict materials properties measured by
experiments are valuable yet challenging due to the limited amount of
experimental data. Most of the existing approaches to predict properties from
computational data have also been directed towards specific material
properties. In this work, we extend this approach, by proposing Landscape
Crystal Graph Convolution Network(LCGCN), an accurate and transferable deep
learning framework based on graph convolutional networks. LCGCN directly learns
the potential energy surface (PES) from atomic configurations. This approach
can enable transferable models that can predict different material properties.
We apply this framework to bulk crystals (i.e. Al2O3), and test it by
calculating potential energy surfaces at different temperatures and across
different phases of crystal.

The characterization of finite-time thermodynamic processes is of crucial
importance for extending equilibrium thermodynamics to nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. The central issue is to quantify responses of thermodynamic
variables and irreversible dissipation associated with non-quasistatic changes
of thermodynamic forces applied to the system. In this study, we derive a
simple formula that incorporates the non-quasistatic response coefficients with
Onsager's kinetic coefficients, where the Onsager coefficients characterize the
relaxation dynamics of fluctuation of extensive thermodynamic variables of
semi-macroscopic systems. Moreover, the dissipated availability that quantifies
the efficiency of the irreversible thermodynamic process is formulated in terms
of the derived non-quasistatic response coefficients. The present results are
demonstrated by using an ideal gas model. The present results are, in
principle, verifiable through experiments and are thus expected to provide a
guiding principle for the nonequilibrium control of macroscopic thermodynamic
systems.

The second-order nonlinear Hall effect illuminates a frequency-doubling
transverse current emerging in quantum materials with broken inversion symmetry
even when time-reversal symmetry is preserved. This nonlinear response
originates from both the Berry curvature dipole and the chiral Bloch electron
skew scatterings, reflecting various information of the lattice symmetries,
band dispersions, and topology of the electron wavefunctions. Even though many
efforts have been put in detecting the nonlinear Hall effect in diverse
condensed matter systems, effective manipulation of the two principal
mechanisms in a single system has been lacking, and the reported response is
relatively weak. Here, we report effective manipulation of the nonlinear Hall
effect and realization of a colossal second-order Hall conductivity, $\sim500
{\mu}mSV^{-1}$, orders of magnitudes higher than the reported values, in AB-BA
stacked twisted double bilayer graphene. A Berry-curvature-dipole-dominated
nonlinear Hall effect, as well as its controllable transition to
skew-scattering-dominated response, is identified near the band edge. The
colossal response, on the other hand, is detected near the van Hove
singularities, mainly determined by the skew scattering of the chiral Bloch
electrons. Our findings establish electrically tunable moir\'e systems
promising for nonlinear Hall effect manipulations and applications.

The supermoir\'e lattice, built by stacking two moir\'e patterns, provides a
platform for creating flat mini-bands and studying electron correlations. An
ultimate challenge in assembling a graphene supermoir\'e lattice is in the
deterministic control of its rotational alignment, which is made highly
probabilistic due to the random nature of the edge chirality and crystal
symmetry of each component layer. In this work, we present an experimental
strategy to overcome this challenge and realize the controlled alignment of
double-aligned hBN/graphene/hBN supermoir\'e lattice, where graphene is
precisely aligned with both top hBN and bottom hBN. Remarkably, we find that
the crystallographic edge of neighboring graphite can be used to better guide
the stacking alignment, as demonstrated by the controlled production of 20
moir\'e samples with an accuracy better than 0.2 degree. Employing this
technique, we are first time to fabricate the perfect double-aligned graphene
supermoir\'e lattice and to observe the sharp resistivity peaks at band filling
of 0, -4 and -8 electrons per moir\'e unit cell. Finally, we extend our
technique to other strongly correlated electron systems, such as low-angle
twisted bilayer graphene and ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, providing a
strategy for flat-band engineering in these moir\'e materials.

Endocytosis is a key cellular process involved in the uptake of nutrients,
pathogens or the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. Most studies have focused
on spherical objects, whereas biologically relevant shapes can be highly
anisotropic. In this letter, we use an experimental model system based on Giant
Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) and dumbbell-shaped colloidal particles to mimic
and investigate the first stage of the passive endocytic process: engulfment of
an anisotropic object by the membrane. Our model has specific ligand-receptor
interactions realized by mobile receptors on the vesicles and immobile ligands
on the particles. Through a series of experiments, theory and molecular
dynamics simulations, we quantify the wrapping process of anisotropic dumbbells
by GUVs and identify distinct stages of the wrapping pathway. We find that the
strong curvature variation in the neck of the dumbbell as well as membrane
tension are crucial in determining both the speed of wrapping and the final
states.

The deformation mechanisms of an extruded Mg-5Y-0.08Ca (wt. %) alloy were
analyzed by means of micropillar compression tests on single crystals along
different orientations -- selected to activate specific deformation modes -- as
well as slip trace analysis, transmission electron microscopy and transmission
Kikuchi diffraction. The polycrystalline alloy presented a remarkable ductility
in tension (~32%) and negligible differences in the yield strength between
tension and compression. It was found that the presence of Y and Ca in solid
solution led to a huge increase in the CRSS for <a> basal slip (29 $\pm$ 5
MPa), <c+a> pyramidal slip (203 $\pm$ 7 MPa) and tensile twin nucleation (above
148 MPa), while the CRSS for <a> prismatic slip only increases up to 105 $\pm$
4 MPa. The changes in the CRSS for slip and tensile twinning in Mg-Y-Ca alloys
expectedly modify the dominant deformation mechanisms in polycrystals. In
particular, tensile twinning is replaced by <a> prismatic slip during
compressive deformation along the a-axis. The reduction of twinning (which
generally induces strong anisotropy in the plastic deformation in textured
alloys), and the activation of <a> prismatic slip (which provides an additional
plastic deformation mechanism with limited hardening) were responsible for the
large tensile ductility of the alloy.

<h3>Perspective: How to overcome dynamical density functional theory</h3>

We argue in favour of developing a comprehensive dynamical theory for
rationalizing, predicting, and machine learning nonequilibrium phenomena that
occur in soft matter. To give guidance for navigating the theoretical and
practical challenges that lie ahead, we discuss and exemplify the limitations
of dynamical density functional theory. Instead of the implied adiabatic
sequence of equilibrium states that this approach provides as a makeshift for
the true time evolution, we posit that the pending theoretical tasks lie in
developing a systematic understanding of the dynamical functional relationships
that govern the genuine nonequilibrium physics. While static density functional
theory gives a comprehensive account of the equilibrium properties of many-body
systems, we argue that power functional theory is the only present contender to
shed similar insights into nonequilibrium dynamics, including the recognition
and implementation of exact sum rules that result from the Noether theorem. As
a demonstration of the power functional point of view, we consider an idealized
steady sedimentation flow of the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones fluid and
machine-learn the kinematic map from the mean motion to the internal force
field. This proof of concept demonstrates the significant potential of machine
learning the inherent functional relationships that govern nonequilibrium
many-body physics.

<h3>Simple Realistic Model of Spin Reorientation in 4f-3d Compounds</h3>

Spin reorientation is an important phenomenon of rare-earth perovskites,
orthoferrites and orthochromites. In this study, we consider a simple but
realistic microscopic theory of the spontaneous spin-reorientation transitions
induced by the 4f-3d interaction, more specifically, the interaction of the
main Kramers doublet or non-Kramers quasi-doublet of the 4f ion with an
effective magnetic field induced by the 3d sublattice. The obtained results
indicate that the cause of both the temperature and the character of the
spin-reorientation transition is a competition between the second and fourth
order spin anisotropy of the 3d sublattice, the crystal field for 4f ions, and
the 4f-3d interaction.

We investigate the rigidity transition associated with shear jamming in
frictionless, as well as frictional, disk packings in the quasi-static regime
and at low shear rates. For frictionless disks, the transition is under
quasistatic shear is discontinuous, with an instantaneous emergence of a system
spanning rigid cluster at the jamming transition. For frictional systems, the
transition appears continuous for finite shear rates, but becomes sharper for
lower shear rates. In the quasi-static limit, it is discontinuous as in the
frictionless case. Thus, our results show that the rigidity transition
associated with shear jamming is discontinuous, as demonstrated in a past for
isotropic jamming of frictionless particles, and therefore a unifying feature
of the jamming transition in general.

The density of states of a quantum system can be calculated from its
definition but, in some cases, this approach is quite cumbersome.
Alternatively, the density of states can be deduced from the microcanonical
entropy or from the canonical partition function. After discussing the
relationship among these procedures, we suggest a simple numerical method,
which is equivalent in the thermodynamic limit to perform a Legendre
transformation, to obtain the density of states from the Helmholtz free energy.
We apply this method to determine the many-body density of states of the
unitary Fermi gas, a very dilute system of identical fermions interacting with
divergent scattering length. The unitary Fermi gas is highy symmetric due to
the absence of any internal scale except for the average distance between two
particles and, for this reason, its equation of state is called universal. In
the last part of the paper, by using the same thermodynamical techniques, we
review some properties of} the density of states of a Schwarzschild black hole,
which shares with the unitary Fermi gas the problem of finding the density of
states directly from its definition.

performed for the first time; there are no corresponding experimental data for

The Dirac equation combines the two cornerstones of modern physics-quantum
mechanics and relativity. There are several manifestations of the Dirac
equation in condensed matter systems, such as the quasiparticle dispersion in
graphene, topological insulators, Dirac semimetals (DSMs), Weyl semimetals, and
d-wave high-temperature superconductors. In a DSM, the massless Dirac fermion
has zero chirality, leading to surface states connected adiabatically to a
topologically trivial surface state as well as vanishing anomalous Hall effect
(AHE). Recently, it is predicted that in the nonrelativistic limit of certain
antiferromagnets, there exists a type of chiral 'Dirac-like' fermion, whose
dispersion manifests four-fold degenerate crossing points formed by doubly
degenerate linear bands, with topologically protected Fermi arcs. Such
unconventional chiral fermion, protected by a hidden SU(2) symmetry in the
hierarchy of an enhanced crystallographic group, namely spin space group, is
not experimentally verified yet. Here, by combining neutron diffraction,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we
reveal the existence of the Fermi-arc surface states induced by chiral
Dirac-like fermions in collinear antiferromagnet CoNb3S6, which caught great
interest due to its surprisingly large AHE. Our transport measurements and
theoretical calculations provide a scenario that large Berry curvature embedded
in the chiral fermions and weak symmetry breaking are responsible for the
emergent AHE. Our work evidences the existence of chiral Dirac-like fermion in
CoNb3S6, paving an avenue for exploring new emergent phenomena in quantum
materials with unconventional quasiparticle excitations.

Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide are endowed with
intrinsic
valley-orbit coupling between their center-of-mass motion and valley
pseudospin.
When trapped in a confinement potential, e.g., generated by strain field, we
find
that intralayer excitons are valley and orbital
angular momentum (OAM) entangled. By tuning trap profile and external
magnetic
field, one can engineer the exciton states at ground state, and realize a
series of valley-OAM entangled states. We further show that the OAM of
excitons can be
transferred to emitted photons, and these novel
exciton states can naturally serve as polarization-OAM locked single photon
emitters, which under certain circumstance become polarization-OAM entangled,
highly tunable by strain trap and magnetic field. Our proposal
demonstrates a novel scheme to generate polarization-OAM locked/entangled
photons at nanoscale with high degree of integrability and tunability,
pointing to exciting
opportunities for quantum information applications.

Nanomechanical spectroscopy (NMS) is a recently developed approach to
determine optical absorption spectra of nanoscale materials via mechanical
measurements. It is based on measuring changes in the resonance frequency of a
membrane resonator vs. the photon energy of incoming light. This method is a
direct measurement of absorption, which has practical advantages compared to
common optical spectroscopy approaches. In the case of two-dimensional (2D)
materials, NMS overcomes limitations inherent to conventional optical methods,
such as the complications associated with measurements at high magnetic fields
and low temperatures. In this work, we develop a protocol for NMS of 2D
materials that yields two orders of magnitude improved sensitivity compared to
previous approaches, while being simpler to use. To this end, we use electrical
sample actuation, which simplifies the experiment and provides a reliable
calibration for greater accuracy. Additionally, the use of low-stress silicon
nitride membranes as our substrate reduces the noise-equivalent power to $NEP =
890 fW/\sqrt{Hz}$, comparable to commercial semiconductor photodetectors. We
use our approach to spectroscopically characterize a two-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenide (WS$_2$), a layered magnetic semiconductor (CrPS$_4$), and
a plasmonic supercrystal consisting of gold nanoparticles.

The valley Zeeman physics of excitons in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides provides valuable insight into the spin and orbital degrees of
freedom inherent to these materials. Being atomically-thin materials, these
degrees of freedom can be influenced by the presence of adjacent layers, due to
proximity interactions that arise from wave function overlap across the 2D
interface. Here, we report 60 T magnetoreflection spectroscopy of the A- and B-
excitons in monolayer WS$_2$, systematically encapsulated in monolayer
graphene. While the observed variations of the valley Zeeman effect for the A-
exciton are qualitatively in accord with expectations from the bandgap
reduction and modification of the exciton binding energy due to the
graphene-induced dielectric screening, the valley Zeeman effect for the B-
exciton behaves markedly different. We investigate prototypical WS$_2$/graphene
stacks employing first-principles calculations and find that the lower
conduction band of WS$_2$ at the $K/K'$ valleys (the $CB^-$ band) is strongly
influenced by the graphene layer on the orbital level. This leads to variations
in the valley Zeeman physics of the B- exciton, consistent with the
experimental observations. Our detailed microscopic analysis reveals that the
conduction band at the $Q$ point of WS$_2$ mediates the coupling between $CB^-$
and graphene due to resonant energy conditions and strong coupling to the Dirac
cone. Our results therefore expand the consequences of proximity effects in
multilayer semiconductor stacks, showing that wave function hybridization can
be a multi-step process with different bands mediating the interlayer
interactions. Such effects can be exploited to resonantly engineer the
spin-valley degrees of freedom in van der Waals and moir\'e heterostructures.

Recently, deformed quantum systems gather lots of attention in the
literature. Dunkl formalism differs from others by containing the
difference-differential and reflection operator. It is one of the most
interesting deformations since it let us discuss the solutions according to the
even and odd solutions. In this work, we studied the ideal Bose gas and the
blackbody radiation via the Dunkl formalism. To this end, we made a liaison
between the coordinate and momentum operators with the creation and
annihilation operators which allowed us to obtain the expressions of the
partition function, the condensation temperature, and the ground state
population of the Bose gas. We found that Dunkl-condensation temperature
increases with increasing $\theta$ value. In the blackbody radiation phenomena,
we found how the Dunkl formalism modifies total radiated energy. Then, we
examined the thermal quantities of the system. We found that the Dunkl
deformation causes an increase in entropy and specific heat functions as well
as in the total radiation energy. However, we observed a decrease in the
Dunk-corrected Helmholtz free energy in this scenario. Finally, we found that
the equation of state is invariant even in the considered formalism.

The Arrhenius crossover temperature, $T_{A}$, corresponds to a thermodynamic
state wherein the atomistic dynamics of a liquid becomes heterogeneous and
cooperative; and the activation barrier of diffusion dynamics becomes
temperature-dependent at temperatures below $T_{A}$. The theoretical estimation
of this temperature is difficult for some types of materials, especially
silicates and borates. In these materials, self-diffusion as a function of the
temperature $T$ is reproduced by the Arrhenius law, where the activation
barrier practically independent on the temperature $T$. The purpose of the
present work was to establish the relationship between the Arrhenius crossover
temperature $T_{A}$ and the physical properties of liquids directly related to
their glass-forming ability. Using a machine learning model, the crossover
temperature $T_{A}$ was calculated for silicates, borates, organic compounds
and metal melts of various compositions. The empirical values of the glass
transition temperature $T_{g}$, the melting temperature $T_{m}$, the ratio of
these temperatures $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the fragility index $m$ were applied as
input parameters. It has been established that the temperatures $T_{g}$ and
$T_{m}$ are significant parameters, whereas their ratio $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the
fragility index $m$ do not correlate much with the temperature $T_{A}$. An
important result of the present work is the analytical equation relating the
temperatures $T_{g}$, $T_{m}$ and $T_{A}$, and that, from the algebraic point
of view, is the equation for a second-order curved surface. It was shown that
this equation allows one to correctly estimate the temperature $T_{A}$ for a
large class of materials, regardless of their compositions and glass-forming
abilities.

<h3>Strong Anharmonic Phonon Renormalization and Dominant Role of Wave-like  Tunnelling of Phonons in Thermal Transport in Lead-free Halide Double  Perovskites</h3>

We thoroughly investigate the microscopic mechanisms of anharmonic lattice
dynamics and thermal transport in lead-free halide double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6
by coupling a first principles-based self-consistent phonon calculation with
bubble diagram correction and a unified theory of lattice thermal transport
considering both the particle-like phonon propagation and wave-like tunnelling
of phonons. This methodology predicts an ultra-low thermal conductivity (e.g.,
~0.21 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K) with extremely weak temperature dependence following
~T-0.45, in sharp contrast to the conventionally predicted ~T-1 dependence.
Particularly, we find that the vibrational properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 are
featured by strong anharmonicity and wave-like tunnelling of phonons. On one
hand, anharmonic phonon renormalization from both the cubic and quartic
anharmonicities are essential in precisely predicting the experimentally
measured phase transition temperature in Cs2AgBiBr6. On the other hand, the
thermal conductivity contribution of the wavelike tunnelling channel surpasses
that of the particle-like propagation channel above around 340 K, indicating
the breakdown of the particle-like phonon picture conventionally used in the
Peierls-Boltzmann Transport Equation (PBTE). Importantly, for thermal transport
in Cs2AgBiBr6, considering only three-phonon or both three- and four-phonon
scattering processes in phonon scattering rates will result in completely
different heat conductance mechanisms, revealing the importance of four-phonon
processes. Our work highlights the importance of lattice anharmonicity and
wave-like tunnelling of phonons in predicting ultra-low thermal conductivity of
Cs2AgBiBr6.

In this paper we give a physically transparent picture of singular-continuous
spectrum in disordered systems which possess a non-ergodic extended phase. We
present a simple model of identically and independently distributed level
spacing in the spectrum of local density of states and show how a fat tail
appears in this distribution at the broad distribution of eigenfunction
amplitudes. For the model with a power-law local spacing distribution we derive
the correlation function $K(\omega)$ of the local density of states and show
that depending on the relation between the eigenfunction fractal dimension
$D_{2}$ and the spectral fractal dimension $D_{s}$ encoded in the power-law
spacing distribution, a singular continuous spectrum of a random Cantor set or
that of an isolated mini-band may appear. In the limit of an infinite number of
degrees of freedom the function $K(\omega)$ in the non-ergodic extended phase
is singular at $\omega=0$ with the branch-cut singularity for the case of a
random Cantor set and with the $\delta$-function singularity for the case of an
isolated mini-band. For an absolutely continuous spectrum $K(\omega)$ tends to
a finite limit as $\omega\rightarrow 0$. For an arbitrary local spacing
distribution function we formulated a criterion of fractality of local spectrum
and tested it on simple examples.

The grand canonical density functional theory for inhomogeneous systems of
interacting bosons is developed in the effective action approach. The Legendre
transform of the generating functional for Green's functions is used to define
the effective action as a functional of both the particle density and the order
parameter. Expanding the thermal effective action in powers of the Planck
constant we obtain a systematic approximation scheme, which practically
implements the Kohn-Sham idea: the problem of interacting bosons is reduced to
a single-particle system in a fictitious external potential. The Kohn-Sham
potential, the density and the order parameter have to be determined
self-consistently in a given order approximation.

<h3>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and generalizations: particle's dynamics  under comb constraints and stochastic resetting</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is interpreted as Brownian motion in a
harmonic potential. This Gaussian Markov process has a bounded variance and
admits a stationary probability distribution, in contrast to the standard
Brownian motion. It also tends to a drift towards its mean function, and such a
process is called mean-reverting. Two examples of the generalized
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process are considered. In the first one, we study the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a comb model, as an example of the harmonically
bounded random motion in the topologically constrained geometry. The main
dynamical characteristics (as the first and the second moments) and the
probability density function are studied in the framework of both the Langevin
stochastic equation and the Fokker-Planck equation. The second example is
devoted to the study of the effects of stochastic resetting on the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, including stochastic resetting in the comb
geometry. Here, the non-equilibrium stationary state is the main question in
task, where the two divergent forces, namely the resetting and the drift
towards the mean, lead to compelling results both in the case of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with resetting and its generalization on the two
dimensional comb structure.

We report on the epitaxial growth, structural and electrical properties of
metallic pyrochlore bismuth ruthenate heterostructures grown along both the
[001] and [111] directions. Ordered pyrochlore thin films were obtained with
highly oriented texture along the [001] and [111] crystallographic directions.
Density functional theory calculations of the electronic band structure and
density of states indicated that Bi$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is semimetallic and that
hybridization of the Ru 4$d$ and Bi 6$p$ orbitals via the anion network at the
Fermi energy was responsible for the metallicity. Electrical conductivity
measurements confirmed that the compound is weakly metallic in agreement with
the reported conductivity for the stoichiometric bulk compound. The carrier
concentration and mobility of the electrons compared favorably with previous
reports on bulk material and indicate strong electron-electron interactions.
The measured and computed optical conductivities were found to share coincident
spectral features and confirm the electronic correlation. Comparison of the
electrical and optical properties of the two distinct orientations indicates
differences that cannot be attributed to differences in crystalline quality or
dislocations and may indicate anisotropy in the electronic structure of
Bi$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$. This study will enable access to the kagome lattice arising
naturally in the {111} planes of the pyrochlore B cation sublattice which may
be used to uncover emergent topological properties.

<h3>Stabilizing hydrogen-rich superconductor around ambient pressure by  charge transfer modulated virtual high-pressure effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
Applying pressure around megabar is indispensable in the synthesis of
high-temperature superconducting hydrides, such as SH$_3$ and LaH$_{10}$.
Stabilizing the high-pressure phase of hydride around ambient condition is a
severe challenge. Based on the density-functional theory calculations, we give
the first example that the structure of hydride CaBH$_5$ predicted above 280
GPa, can maintain its dynamical stability with pressure down to 1 GPa, by
modulating the charge transfer from metal atoms to hydrogen atoms via the
replacement of Ca with alkali metal atoms e.g. Cs, in which the [BH$_5$]$^{2-}$
anion shrinks along $c$ axis and expands in the $ab$ plane, experiencing an
anisotropic virtual high pressure. This mechanism, namely charge transfer
modulated virtual high pressure effect, plays a vital role in enhancing the
structural stability and leading to the reemergence of
ambient-pressure-forbidden [BH$_5$]$^{2-}$ anion around 1 GPa in CsBH$_5$.
Moreover, we find that CsBH$_5$ is a strongly coupled superconductor, with
transition temperature as high as 98 K, well above the liquid-nitrogen
temperature. Our findings provide a novel mechanism to reduce the critical
pressure required by hydrogen-rich compound without changing its crystal
structure, and also shed light on searching ambient-pressure high-temperature
superconductivity in metal borohydrides.

<h3>Cubic C$_{20}$: An intrinsic superconducting carbon allotrope</h3>

<br>
Finding new phases of carbon is an interesting topic. Based on density
functional first-principles calculations, we propose the first cubic metallic
carbon allotrope, namely sc-C$_{20}$. The elastic properties, electronic
structure, lattice dynamics, and phonon-mediated superconductivity of
sc-C$_{20}$ are systematically studied. It is found that the metallicity
originates from the $p$ orbitals of carbon atoms, which are perpendicular to
the $sp^2$-bonding planes. The electron-phonon coupling is accurately computed
with Wannier interpolation method. By solving the isotropic Eliashberg
equations self-consistently, we predict that sc-C$_{20}$ is an intrinsic carbon
superconductor, without introducing any guest atoms or doping, whose transition
temperature is determined to be 24.6 K. Moreover, the formation energy of
sc-C$_{20}$ is lower than those of body-centered-cubic C$_8$ and T-carbon which
have been synthesized. In combination with the dynamical stability ascertained
by phonon spectrum, we believe there is a high probability to obtain
sc-C$_{20}$ in experiment.

<h3>Nonlocal Kondo effect and two-fluid picture revealed in an exactly  solvable model</h3>

Understanding the nature of local-itinerant transition of strongly correlated
electrons is one of the central problems in condensed matter physics. Heavy
fermion systems describe the f-electron delocalization through Kondo
interactions with conduction electrons. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to
the so-called Kondo-destruction scenario, which predicts a dramatic
local-to-itinerant quantum phase transition of f-electrons at zero temperature.
On the other hand, two-fluid behaviors have been observed in many materials,
suggesting coexistence of local and itinerant f-electrons over a broad
temperature range but lacking a microscopic theoretical description. To
elucidate this fundamental issue, here we propose an exactly solvable
Kondo-Heisenberg model in which the spins are defined in the momentum space and
the k-space Kondo interaction corresponds to a highly nonlocal spin scattering
in the coordinate space. Its solution reveals a continuous evolution of the
Fermi surfaces with Kondo interaction and two-fluid behaviors similar to those
observed in real materials. The electron density violates the usual Luttinger's
theorem, but follows a generalized one allowing for partially enlarged Fermi
surfaces due to partial Kondo screening in the momentum space. Our results
highlight the consequence of nonlocal Kondo interaction relevant for strong
quantum fluctuation regions, and provide important insight into the microscopic
description of two-fluid phenomenology in heavy fermion systems.

oxygen was verified using density-functional theory. Dissociation and diffusion
barriers have been calculated in order to understand surface and pore oxidation
and its electronic properties at the atomic scale, which opens the path for
future investigations of MoS$_2$ pores in a realistic environment.

The magnetic response is a state-defining property of superconductors. The
magnetic flux penetrates type-II bulk superconductors by forming quantum
vortices when the enclosed magnetic flux is equal to the magnetic flux quantum.
The flux quantum is the universal quantity that depends only on the ratio of
fundamental constants: the electron charge and the Planck constant. This work
investigates the vortex state in the hole-overdoped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$
by using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometry. We observed quantum vortices that carry only a fraction of the
flux quantum, which vary continuously with temperature. This finding
establishes the phenomenon that superconductors support quantum vortices with
non-universally quantized magnetic flux. Furthermore, the demonstrations of the
mobility of the fractional vortices and the manipulability of their positions
open up a route for future fluxonics applications.

The present paper deals with the results of a research work on the optical
properties of colloidal InP/ZnS nanocrystals stabilized with a
heterobifunctional polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer. We have analyzed the
absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the samples as solutions with
various concentrations and deposited films, as well as the patterns of their
temperature changes in the range of 6.5 - 296 K. An inhomogeneous broadening of
exciton optical bands has been observed to be related to a wide distribution of
nanocrystals in size. A temperature shift of the exciton absorption and
emission maxima has been found to be due to the interaction with acoustic
phonons. It has been shown that the quenching of defect-related luminescence is
carried out through local energy levels of dangling bonds of phosphorus atoms
involved at the core-shell interface, and the temperature stability of exciton
emission is determined by the thickness of the ZnS shell.

We investigate the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of nanostructured
Nd0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (NSMO) thin films grown on (100) oriented SrTiO3 (STO)
substrates. The thin films fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition
technique have been found to possess two distinct surface morphologies:
granular and nano rod type. Magnetization measurements have revealed that the
films with rod-type morphology exhibit improved in-plane magnetic anisotropy.
Magnetotransport studies have revealed that the granular thin films display a
characteristic butterfly-shaped low-field magneto-resistive (LFMR) behavior.
Furthermore, we investigate the anisotropic magneto-resistive (AMR) phenomenon
in the samples and we find that morphology greatly affects AMR. Thin films with
rod-type morphology show an enhanced AMR %. Such morphology dependent
tunability in magnetoresistance properties over a wide temperature range is
potentially interesting for developing oxide-based sensors and devices.

<br>
<br>
In rare-earth compounds with valence fluctuation, the proximity of the 4f
level to the Fermi energy leads to instabilities of the charge configuration
and the magnetic moment. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence for an
induced magnetic polarization of the Eu$^{3+}$ atomic shell with J=0, due to
intra-atomic exchange and spin-orbital coupling interactions with Eu$^{2+}$
atomic shell. By applying external pressure, a transition from
antiferromagnetic to a fluctuating behavior in a EuNiGe$_3$ single crystals is
probed. Magnetic polarization is observed for both valence states of Eu$^{2+}$
and Eu$^{3+}$ across the entire pressure range. The anomalous magnetism is
discussed in terms of a homogeneous intermediate valence state where frustrated
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings are enhanced by the onset of spin-orbital
interaction and engender a chiral spin-liquid-like precursor.

<br>
<br>
Sn thin films were deposited at $\SI{-193}{\degree C}$ in ultra high vacuum
on InSb(110) substrates. Cryogenic cooling ensured controllable crystallinity
and homogeneous thickness of thin films below $\SI{15}{\nm}$. We employed
different $in-situ$ capping strategies immediately after Sn deposition to
minimize likelihood of dewetting of the thin films. X-ray diffraction show how
the Sn crystalline structure is influenced by the different cappings. The film
is predominantly in the cubic Sn phase ($\alpha$-Sn), is epitaxial on InSb and
presents very low mosaicity. However, we identified a correlation between
alumina capping and the abundance of the tetragonal Sn phase ($\beta$-Sn).
Heating by the alumina e-beam source is a potential reason for the partial
crystalline phase transition in the Sn layer. The presence of the $\beta$-Sn
phase caused the superconducting behavior of the films by percolation effect.
Finally, this work showed that ultra-thin films of Sn on InSb substrates can be
produced controllably, with perspectives for quantum computing platforms.

The Josephson vortex formed in a superconductor-insulator-superconductor
(SIS) junction can affect the quantum mechanics of quasiparticles by creating
an effective adiabatic potential determined by the inhomogeneous distribution
of the phase difference of the order parameter along the junction. Starting
from the quasiclassical version of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) theory, we
found the quasiparticle spectrum and the local density of states (DOS) both for
the isolated Josephson vortex and the vortex chain. The spatially resolved DOS
reveals a peculiar two-peak structure for each Josephson vortex, which can be
detected experimentally using the scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy
techniques.

Within the framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory we show
that circularly polarized THz or far-infrared radiation induces a dc
supercurrent that influences the dynamics of vortex-antivortex pair formation
in a mesoscopic superconductor undergoing rapid thermal quenching. The Lorentz
force arising from the supercurrents promotes vortex-antivortex separation and
allows survival of the vortex polarity defined by the helicity of light. Based
on this idea, we propose a two-stage irradiation scheme that provides a
powerful method for controlled all-optical generation of Abrikosov vortices.

The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations
mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated
systems. A recent work [Science \textbf{375}, 417 (2022)] made a remarkable
breakthrough in the sign problem and suggested a positive connection between
the sign and phase transition. How general this argument is can be crucial in
various fields related to many-body systems, such as condensed matter physics,
quantum chemistry, and nuclear physics. Based on universal analyses of typical
examples and numerical simulations from different approaches, we discuss when
and how studying the sign can provide helpful information on phase transitions
in general systems independent of specific models and algorithms. While our
results support that the notorious sign offers new angles in exploring quantum
many-body problems, we also notice that taking advantage of the sign can even
be as challenging as neutralizing the sign problem itself in unknown systems.

We analyze results of a recent experiment [D. Razmadze et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett., 125, 116803 (2020)] on transport through a quantum dot between two
full-shell nanowires and show that the observed effects are caused by the Kondo
effect enhancement due to a nontrivial geometry (magnetic flux in a full-shell
nanowire) rather than the presence of Majorana bound states. Moreover, we
propose that such a setup presents a unique and convenient system to study the
competition between superconductivity and the Kondo effect and has significant
advantages in comparison to other known approaches, as the important parameter
is controlled by the magnetic flux through the full-shell nanowire, which can
be significantly varied with small changes of magnetic field, and does not
require additional gates. This competition is of fundamental interest as it
results in a quantum phase transition between an unscreened doublet and a
many-body Kondo singlet ground states of the system.

<h3>The escape transition in a self-avoiding walk model of linear polymers</h3>

A linear polymer grafted to a hard wall and underneath an AFM tip can be
modelled in a lattice as a grafted lattice polymer (or self-avoiding walk)
compressed underneath a piston approaching the wall. As the piston approaches
the wall the increasingly confined polymer escapes from the confined region to
explore conformations beside the piston. This conformational change is believed
to be a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit, and has been argued to be
first order, based on numerical results in reference [12]. In this paper a
lattice self-avoiding walk model of the escape transition is constructed. It is
proven that this model has a critical point in the thermodynamic limit
corresponding to the escape transition of grafted linear polymers being
compressed by a piston. This result relies on the analysis of ballistic
self-avoiding walks in slits and slabs in the square and cubic lattices.
Additionally, numerical estimates of the location of the escape transition
critical point is reported based on Monte Carlo simulations of self-avoiding
walks in slits and in slabs.

A vast array of phenomena, ranging from chemical reactions to phase
transformations, are analysed in terms of a free energy surface defined with
respect to a single or multiple order parameters. Enhanced sampling methods are
typically used, especially in the presence of large free energy barriers, to
estimate free energies using biasing protocols and sampling of transition
paths. Kinetic reconstructions of free energy barriers of intermediate height
have been performed, with respect to a single order parameter, employing the
steady state properties of unconstrained simulation trajectories when barrier
crossing is achievable with reasonable computational effort. Considering such
cases, we describe a method to estimate free energy surfaces with respect to
multiple order parameters from a steady state ensemble of trajectories. The
approach applies to cases where the transition rates between pairs of order
parameter values considered is not affected by the presence of an absorbing
boundary, whereas the macroscopic fluxes and sampling probabilities are. We
demonstrate the applicability of our prescription on different test cases of
random walkers executing Brownian motion in order parameter space with an
underlying (free) energy landscape and discuss strategies to improve numerical
estimates of the fluxes and sampling. We next use this approach to reconstruct
the free energy surface for supercooled liquid silicon with respect to the
degree of crystallinity and density, from unconstrained molecular dynamics
simulations, and obtain results quantitatively consistent with earlier results
from umbrella sampling.

<h3>Magnetic field effect on tunneling through triple barrier in AB bilayer  graphene</h3>

We investigate electrons tunneling in AB bilayer graphene through a triple
electrostatic barrier in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. By way
of the transfer matrix method and using the continuity conditions at the
different interfaces, transmission probability is determined. Additional
resonances appear for two-band tunneling and at normal incidence, and their
number is proportional to the value of $U_4$ in cases where $U_2<U_4$ is
present. However, when $U_2>U_4$, anti-Klein tunneling increases with $U_2$.
The transmission probability exhibits an interesting oscillatory behavior when
$U_3>U_2=U_4$ and $U_3 <U_2=U_4$. For fixed energy $E=0.39\gamma_1$, increasing
barrier widths increases the number of oscillations and decreases Klein
tunneling. An interlayer bias creates a gap for: $U_2<U_3<U_4$ and
$U_3>U_2=U_4$. In the four-band tunneling case, transmission decreases in
$T^+_+$, $T^-_+$ and $T^-_-$ channels in comparison with the single barrier
case. It does, however, increase for $T^+_-$ when compared to the single

bias is introduced. Our results are relevant for electron confinements in AB

The inclusion of long-range couplings in the Kitaev chain is shown to modify
the universal scaling of topological states close to the critical point. By
means of the scattering approach, we prove that the Majorana states soften,
becoming increasingly delocalised at a universal rate which is only determined
by the interaction range. This edge mechanism can be related to a change in the
value of the bulk topological index at criticality, upon careful redefinition
of the latter. The critical point turns out to be topologically akin to the
trivial phase rather than interpolating between the two phases. Our treatment
moreover showcases how various topological aspects of quantum models can be
investigated analytically.

In this paper, we develop the mathematical framework to describe the physical
phenomenon behind the equilibrium configuration joining two antiferromagnetic
domains. We firstly define the total energy of the system and deduce the
governing equations by minimizing it with respect to the field variables. Then,
we solve the resulting system of nonlinear PDEs together with proper initial
and boundary conditions by varying the orientation of the 90$^{\circ}$ domain
wall (DW) configuration along the sample. Finally, the angular dependence of
elastic and magnetoelastic energies as well as of incompatibility-driven volume
effects is computed.

The mechanical behavior of porous materials depends strongly on porosity and
pore geometry, but also on morphological parameters characterizing the spatial
arrangement of pores. Here we use bond-based peridynamics to study effects of
disorder on the deformation and failure behavior of brittle porous solids both
in the quasi-static limit and in case of dynamic loading scenarios. We show
that structural disorder, which has a strong influence on stiffness, strength
and toughness in the quasi-static limit, becomes less relevant under dynamic
loading conditions.

Size-invariant shape transformation gives rise to the so-called quantum shape
effect in strongly confined systems. While quantum size and shape effects are
often thought to be difficult to distinguish because of their coexistence, it
is actually possible to separate them and focus solely on the shape effect. In
fact, quantum shape effect is a quite different phenomenon from quantum size
effects, as it can have the opposite influence on the physical properties of
nanoscale systems. Here we explore the origin of the quantum shape effect by
theoretically investigating the simplest system that can produce the same
physics: quantum particles in a box separated by a moving partition. The
partition moves quasistatically from one end of the box to the other, allowing
the system to remain in equilibrium with a reservoir throughout the process.
The partition and the boundaries are impenetrable by particles, forming two
effectively interconnected regions. Position of the partition becomes the shape
variable. We investigate quantum shape effect on the thermodynamic properties
of confined particles. In addition, we applied a new analytical model based on
dimensional transitions to accurately predict thermodynamic properties under
the quantum shape effect. A fundamental understanding of quantum shape effects
could pave the way for employing them to engineer physical properties and
design better materials at nanoscale.

<br>
<br>
The Josephson effect of inter-layer s-wave pairing in a double layer of two
chiral metals is considered. We employ the duality relation between
electron-electron and electron-hole double layers to discuss the zero-energy
eigenmodes at a domain wall and their coupling to the superfluid state. This is
described in terms of the quasiparticle current and the supercurrent. It turns
out that the degeneracy of the zero-energy eigenmodes is resolved by the
coupling to the supercurrent. The duality relation between the
electron-electron and electron-hole double layers leads to the same current
distribution in both systems but to different zero-energy modes.

<br>
<br>
Magnons are quantized collective spin-wave excitations in magnetically
ordered systems. Revealing their interactions among these collective modes is
crucial for the understanding of fundamental many-body effects in such systems
and the development of high-speed information transport and processing devices
based on them. Nevertheless, identifying couplings between individual magnon
modes remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we observe unambiguous
spectroscopic fingerprints of anharmonic coupling between distinct magnon modes
in an antiferromagnet, as evidenced by coherent photon emission at the sum and
difference frequencies of the two modes. This discovery is enabled by driving
two magnon modes coherently with a pair of tailored terahertz fields and then
disentangling a mixture of nonlinear responses with different origins,
symmetries, and field dependences in a two-dimensional frequency-frequency
correlation map. Our approach provides a new platform for generating nonlinear
magnon-magnon mixings and establishes a systematic means of unveiling intricate
couplings among distinct low-energy collective modes.

Monatomic antimony thin films have recently attracted attention for
applications in phase change memory, nanophotonics, and 2D materials. Although
some promising results have been reported, the true potential of Sb thin films
is still hindered by the scalability issue and the lack of reliable bottom-up
production. Here we demonstrate the growth of Sb thin films on a
lattice-matching and amorphous substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD).
C-axis out-of-plane textured Sb thin films were successfully deposited on
Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and SiO$_2$\Si$_3$N$_4$ substrates. In the case of growth on
Sb$_2$Te$_3$, we show that an intermediate phase is formed at the
Sb$_2$Te$_3$-Sb interface playing a crucial role in forming a solid coupling
and thus maintaining epitaxy leading to the production of high-quality Sb thin
films. A 3 - 4 nm amorphous Sb seed layer was used to induce texture and
suitable surface termination for the growth of Sb thin films on amorphous
substrates. The deposition parameters were fine-tuned, and the growth was
monitored in situ by a Reflective High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED).
Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscopy (S/TEM) unveiled the local structure
of produced films showing the formation of $\beta$-phase Sb thin films. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility to produce very smooth high-quality
antimony thin films with uniform coverage, from few layers to large
thicknesses, using pulsed laser deposition. We believe the results of our work
on scalable and controllable Sb growth have the potential to open up research
on phase-change materials and optoelectronics research.

Coherent optical manipulation of electronic bandstructures via Floquet
Engineering is a promising means to control quantum systems on an ultrafast
timescale. However, the ultrafast switching on/off of the driving field comes
with questions regarding the limits of validity of the Floquet formalism, which
is defined for an infinite periodic drive, and to what extent the transient
changes can be driven adibatically. Experimentally addressing these questions
has been difficult, in large part due to the absence of an established
technique to measure coherent dynamics through the duration of the pulse. Here,
using multidimensional coherent spectroscopy we explicitly excite, control, and
probe a coherent superposition of excitons in the $K$ and $K^\prime$ valleys in
monolayer WS$_2$. With a circularly polarized, red-detuned, pump pulse, the
degeneracy of the $K$ and $K^\prime$ excitons can be lifted and the phase of
the coherence rotated. We demonstrate phase rotations during the 100 fs driving
pulse that exceed $\pi$, and show that this can be described by a combination
of the AC-Stark shift of excitons in one valley and Bloch-Siegert shift of
excitons in the opposite valley. Despite showing a smooth evolution of the
phase that directly follows the intensity envelope of the pump pulse, the
process is not perfectly adiabatic. By measuring the magnitude of the
macroscopic coherence as it evolves before, during, and after the pump pulse we
show that there is additional decoherence caused by power broadening in the
presence of the pump. This non-adiabaticity may be a problem for many
applications, such as manipulating q-bits in quantum information processing,
however these measurements also suggest ways such effects can be minimised or
eliminated.

A coherent Ising machine (CIM) is known to deliver the low-energy states of
the Ising model. Here, we investigate how well the CIM simulates the
thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model.
Assuming that the spin sets sampled by the CIM can be regarded as a canonical
ensemble, we estimate the effective temperature of the spins represented by
degenerate optical parametric oscillator pulses by using maximum likelihood
estimation. With the obtained temperature, we confirmed that the thermodynamic
quantities obtained with the CIM exhibited a phase-transition-like behavior
that better matches the analytical and numerical results than the mean field
one.

The paradigm of classifying three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators
into strong and weak ones (STI and WTI) opens the door for the discovery of
various topological phases of matter protected by different symmetries and
defined in different dimensions. However, in contrast to the vast realization
of STIs, very few materials have been experimentally identified as being close
to WTI. Even amongst those identified, none exists with topological surface
states (TSS) exposed in a global bulk band gap that is stable at all
temperatures. Here we report the design and observation of an ideal WTI in a
quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) bismuth halide, Bi$_{4}$I$_{1.2}$Br$_{2.8}$
(BIB). Via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we identify that
BIB hosts TSS on the (100)$\prime$ side surface in the form of two anisotropic
$\pi$-offset Dirac cones (DCs) separated in momentum while topologically dark
on the (001) top surface. The ARPES data fully determine a unique side-surface
Hamiltonian and thereby identify two pairs of non-degenerate helical saddle
points and a series of four Lifshitz transitions. The fact that both the
surface Dirac and saddle points are in the global bulk band gap of 195 meV,
combined with the small Dirac velocities, nontrivial spin texture, and the
near-gap chemical potential, qualifies BIB to be not only an ideal WTI but also
a fertile ground for topological many-body physics.

We developed a generalized model that considers light as energy contributed
through the thermalization of excited carriers to generate
excitation-intensity- and temperature-dependent phase diagrams. We find that
the model replicates the light-induced phase segregation behavior of the
MAPb(I,Br)3 system. From there, we sought to study how best to design new,
stable, mixed-halide alloys. The resultant first-principles predictions show
that the pseudo halide anion BF4- suppresses phase segregation in
FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, resulting in enhanced operating stability. The
findings reveal that photostability is linked with the structure and electronic
properties of materials and may be overcome using informed alloying strategies.

Multiple-$Q$ states manifest themselves in a variety of noncollinear and
noncoplanar magnetic structures depending on the magnetic interactions and
lattice structures. In particular, cubic-lattice systems can host a plethora of
multiple-$Q$ states, such as magnetic skyrmion and hedgehog lattices. We here
classify momentum-dependent anisotropic exchange interactions in the
cubic-lattice systems based on the magnetic representation analysis. We
construct an effective spin model for centrosymmetric cubic space groups,
$Pm\bar{3}m$ and $Pm\bar{3}$, and noncentrosymmetric ones, $P\bar{4}3m$,
$P432$, and $P23$: The former include the symmetric anisotropic exchange
interaction, while the latter additionally include the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. We demonstrate that the anisotropic exchange interaction becomes
the origin of the multiple-$Q$ states by applying the anisotropic spin model to
the case under $Pm\bar{3}$. We show several multiple-$Q$ instabilities in the
ground state by performing simulated annealing. Our results will be a reference
for not only exploring unknown multiple-$Q$ states but also understanding the
origin of the multiple-$Q$ states observed in both noncentrosymmetric and
centrosymmetric magnets like EuPtSi and SrFeO$_3$.

<br>
Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
such as MoS$_2$, are promising candidates for nanoscale photonics because of
strong-light matter interactions. However, Fermi level pinning due to
metal-induced gap (MIGS) states at the metals-monolayer MoS$_2$ interface
limits the application of optoelectronic devices based on conventional metals
because of the high contact resistance of the Schottky contacts. On the other
hand, a semimetal-TMD-semimetal device can overcome this limitation, where the
MIGS are sufficiently suppressed and can result in ohmic contacts. Here we
demonstrate the optoelectronic performance of a bismuth-monolayer (1L)
MoS$_2$-bismuth device with ohmic electrical contacts and extraordinary
optoelectronic properties. To address the wafer-scale production, we grew full
coverage 1L MoS$_2$ by using chemical vapor deposition method. We measured high
photoresponsivity of 300 A/W in the UV regime at 77 K, which translates into an
external quantum efficiency (EQE) ~ 1000 or $10^5$%. We found that the 90% rise
time of our devices at 77 K is 0.1 ms, which suggests that the current devices
can operate at the speed of ~ 10 kHz. The combination of large-array device
fabrication, high sensitivity, and high-speed response offers great potential
for applications in photonics that includes integrated optoelectronic circuits.

Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit a broad palette of
unique and superlative properties, including high electrical and thermal
conductivities, paired with the ability to exfoliate or grow and transfer
single layers onto a variety of substrates thanks to the relatively weak vdW
interlayer bonding. However, the same vdW bonds also lead to relatively low
thermal boundary conductance (TBC) between the 2D layer and its 3D substrate,
which is the main pathway for heat removal and thermal management in devices,
leading to a potential thermal bottleneck and dissipation-driven performance
degradation. Here we use first-principles phonon dispersion with our 2D-3D
Boltzmann phonon transport model to compute the TBC of 156 unique 2D/3D
interface pairs, many of which are not available in the literature. We then
employ machine learning (ML) to develop streamlined predictive models, of which
Neural Network and Gaussian process display the highest predictive accuracy
(RMSE $<$ 5 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and $R^2>$0.99) on the complete descriptor set.
Then we perform sensitivity analysis to identify the most impactful
descriptors, consisting of the vdW spring coupling constant, 2D thermal
conductivity, ZA phonon bandwidth, the ZA phonon resonance gap, and the
frequency of the first van Hove singularity or Boson peak. On that reduced set,
we find that a decision-tree algorithm can make accurate predictions (RMSE $<$
20 MWm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$ and $R^2>$0.9) on materials it has not been trained on by
performing a transferability analysis. Our model allows optimal selection of
2D-substrate pairings to maximize heat transfer and will improve thermal
management in future 2D nanoelectronics.

imaging with a boron vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) defects array in hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) with a few 10 nm thickness. V$_\text{B}^-$ sensor spots with a
size of (100~nm)$^2$ are arranged periodically with nanoscale precision using a
helium ion microscope and attached tightly to a gold wire. The sensor array
allows us to visualize the magnetic field induced by the current in the wire
with a spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Each sensor exhibits a
practical sensitivity of $73.6~\mu\text{T/Hz}^{0.5}$, suitable for quantum

Optimizing magnetic thin films for nanotechnologies often requires imaging
nanoscale magnetic domain patterns via magnetic microscopy. The finite size of
the image may however significantly affect the characterization of the observed
magnetic states. We evaluated finite image size effects on the characterization
of a variety of stripe and bubble domain patterns exhibited by ferromagnetic
Co/Pt multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, where the domain size
(stripe width and bubble diameter) is around 100 nm. If the image size is too
small, below ~ 5 microns, it may cause a significant underestimation of average
domain size and overestimation of domain density by up to a factor 5 when
reducing the image size from about 20 microns to about a 1 microns. Using a
criterion based on how the excess density evolves with image size, we found
that to obtain reliable statistical estimates of domain density and average
domain size, the image needs to be large enough, and include at least about 100
stripes or about 2500 bubbles.

Using molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we report on the
solvation process in water and in cyclohexane of seven polypeptides (GLY, ALA,
ILE, ASN, LYS, ARG, GLU). The polypeptides are selected to cover the full
hydrophobic scale while varying their chain length from tri- to
undeca-homopeptides provide indications on possible non-additivity effects as
well as the role of the peptide backbone in the overall stability of the
polypeptides. The use of different solvents and different polypeptides allows
us to investigate the relation between solvent quality -- the capacity of a
given solvent to fold a given biopolymer often described on a scale ranging
from "good" to "poor", and solvent polarity -- related to the specific
interactions of any solvent with respect to a reference solvent. Undeca-glycine
is found to be the only polypeptides to have a proper stable collapse in water
(polar solvent), with the other hydrophobic polypetides displaying in water
repeated folding and unfolding events and with polar polypeptides presenting a
even more complex behavior. By contrast, all polypeptides but none are found to
keep an extended conformation in cyclohexane, irrespective of their polarity.
All considered polypeptides are also found to have a favorable solvation free
energy independently of the solvent polarity and their intrinsic
hydrophobicity, clearly highlighting the prominent stabilizing role of the
peptide backbone, with the solvation process largely enthalpically dominated in
polar polypeptides and partially entropically driven for hydrophobic
polypeptides. Our study thus reveals the complexity of the solvation process of
polypeptides defying the common view " like dissolves like", with the solute
polarity playing the most prominent role. The absence of a mirror symmetry upon
the inversion of polarities of both the solvent and the polypeptides is
confirmed.

Nanocomposite membranes are an emerging filtration material in the production
of clean water. Recently, the fabrication of porous nanocomposite membranes via
solvent transfer induced phase separation (STrIPS) was introduced. During
STrIPS, the phase separation of two immiscible liquids is arrested by the
attachment of nanoparticles at the liquid-liquid interface, generating a porous
particle-stabilized membrane template. STrIPS nanocomposite membranes, however,
have so far only been produced as hollow fibers. To overcome this, we designed
a roll-to-roll (R2R)-process for the continuous fabrication of flat-sheet
nanocomposite membranes via STrIPS. We produce the STrIPS membrane by printing
the membrane precursor on a carrier substrate. This allows for the continuous
collection of STrIPS membranes with control over the membrane dimensions.
Contact angle measurements elucidate the wetting dynamics of the STrIPS
membrane on the substrate. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over the
membrane pore structure by varying the precusor liquid composition and by
changing the particle modification and loading in the membrane. With this, the
R2R-approach may stimulate further advancements in the fabrication of
flat-sheet nanocomposite membranes via STrIPS.

There is a long-standing question of whether it is possible to extend the
formalism of equilibrium thermodynamics to the case of non-equilibrium systems
in steady states. We have made such an extension for an ideal gas in a heat
flow [Ho\l{}yst \emph{et al.}, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 194108 (2022)]. Here we
investigate whether such a description exists for the system with interactions:
the Van der Waals gas in a heat flow. We introduce the parameters of state,
each associated with a single way of changing energy. The first law of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics follows from these parameters. The internal
energy $U$ for the non-equilibrium states has the same form as in equilibrium
thermodynamics. For the Van der Waals gas, $U(S^*, V, N, a^*,b^* )$ is a
function of only 5 parameters of state (irrespective of the number of
parameters characterizing the boundary conditions): the entropy $S^*$, volume
$V$, number of particles $N$, and the rescaled Van der Waals parameters $a^*$,
$b^*$. The state parameters, $a^*$, $b^*$, together with $S^*$, determine the
net heat exchange with the environment.

Silicon is indispensable in semiconductor industry. Understanding its
high-temperature thermodynamic properties is essential both for theory and
applications. However, first-principle description of high-temperature
thermodynamic properties of silicon (thermal expansion coefficient and specific
heat) is still incomplete. Strong deviation of its specific heat at high
temperatures from the Dulong-Petit law suggests substantial contribution of
anharmonicity effects. We demonstrate, that anharmonicity is mostly due to two
transverse phonon modes, propagating in (111) and (100) directions, and can be
quantitatively described with formation of the certain type of nanostructured
planar defects of the crystal structure. Calculation of these defects'
formation energy enabled us to determine their input into the specific heat and
thermal expansion coefficient. This contribution turns out to be significantly
greater than the one calculated in quasi-harmonic approximation.

microstructure and to draw inspiration for the design of impact-resistant
biomimetic materials. Less is known regarding the dynamic behavior related to
their structure at multiple scales. Here, we present a combined experimental
and numerical study of the shells of two different species of gastropod sea
snail belonging to the Turritellidae family, featuring a peculiar helicoconic
shape with hierarchical spiral elements. The proposed procedure involves the
use of micro-Computed Tomography scans for the accurate determination of
geometry, Atomic Force Microscopy and Nanoindentation to evaluate local
mechanical properties, surface morphology and heterogeneity, as well as
Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy coupled with Finite Element Analysis
simulations to determine global modal behavior. Results indicate that the
specific features of the considered shells, in particular their helicoconic and
hierarchical structure, can also be linked to their vibration attenuation
behavior. Moreover, the proposed investigation method can be extended to the
study of other natural systems, to determine their structure-related dynamic
properties, ultimately aiding the design of bioinspired metamaterials and of
structures with advanced vibration control.

<h3>Four terminal quantum dot as an efficient rectifier of heat and charge  currents</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We propose an efficient method of heat rectification in a simple system
consisting of a quantum dot asymmetrically coupled to four mutually
perpendicular electrodes. In such a device the Hall-like charge and heat
currents appear in response to the voltage bias or temperature difference
between one pair of electrodes. Even though both longitudinal (along the bias)
and Hall-like (perpendicular to the bias) currents are rectified under
appropriate conditions, the rectification factor is typically much bigger for
the latter currents. This is true for heat and charge flow. The Hall-like
currents are predicted to exist in linear as well as non-linear transport
regimes and require broken mirror symmetry but not time reversal symmetry. The
linear effect exists only in geometry which breaks two inversion symmetries
along two pairs of electrically coupled terminals. The proposed system is
attainable within current technology and provides novel platform of
simultaneous heat and charge management at the nanoscale.

<h3>Synthetic magnetism for solitons in optomechanical array</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a synthetic magnetism to generate and to control solitonic waves
in $\rm{1D}-$optomechanical array. Each optomechanical cavity in the array
couples to its neighbors through photon and phonon coupling. We create the
synthetic magnetism by modulating the phonon hopping rate through a modulation
frequency, and a modulation phase between resonators at different sites. When
the synthetic magnetism effect is not taken into account, the mechanical
coupling play a scrucial role of controlling and switching the waves from
bright to dark solitons, and it even induces rogue wave-like a shape in the
array. For enough mechanical coupling strength, the system enters in a strong
coupling regime through splitting/crossing of solitonic waves leading to
multiple waves propagation in the array. Under the synthetic magnetism effect,
the phase of the modulation enables a good control of the wave propagation, and
it also switches soliton shape from bright to dark, and even induces rogue
waves as well. Similarly to the mechanical coupling, the synthetic magnetism
offers another flexible way to generate plethora of solitonic waves for
specific purposes. This work opens new avenues for optomechanical platforms and
sheets light on their potentiality of controlling and switching solitonic waves
based on synthetic magnetism.

<h3>Designing light rare-earth intermetallic compounds for magnetocaloric  hydrogen liquefaction covering the temperature range of 77 ~ 20 K</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction could be a "game-changer" for liquid
hydrogen industry. Although heavy rare-earth-based magnetocaloric materials
show strong magnetocaloric effects in the temperature range required by
hydrogen liquefaction (77 ~ 20 K), the high resource criticality of the heavy
rare-earth elements is a major obstacle for upscaling this emerging
liquefaction technology. In contrast, the higher abundances of the light
rare-earth elements make their alloys highly appealing for magnetocaloric
hydrogen liquefaction. Via a mean-field approach, it is demonstrated that
tuning the Curie temperature ($T_C$) of an idealized light rare-earth-based
magnetocaloric material towards lower cryogenic temperatures leads to larger
maximum magnetic and adiabatic temperature changes ($\Delta S_T$ and $\Delta
T_{ad}$). Especially in the vicinity of the condensation point of hydrogen (20
K), $\Delta S_T$ and $\Delta T_{ad}$ of the optimized light rare-earth-based
material are predicted to show significantly large values. Following the
mean-field approach and taking the chemical and physical similarities of the
light rare-earth elements into consideration, a method of designing light
rare-earth intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction is proposed:
tunning $T_C$ of a rare-earth alloy to approach 20 K by mixing light rare-earth
elements with different de Gennes factors. By mixing Nd and Pr in Laves phase
$(Nd,Pr)Al_2$, and Pr and Ce in Laves phase $(Pr,Ce)Al_2$, a fully light
rare-earth intermetallic series with large magnetocaloric effects covering the
temperature range required by hydrogen liquefaction is developed, demonstrating
a competitive maximum effect compared to the heavy rare-earth compound
$DyAl_2$.

<br>
<br>
The photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskite
semiconductors are controlled by excitons, so that investigation of their
fundamental properties is of critical importance. The exciton Land\'e or
g-factor g_X is the key parameter, determining the exciton Zeeman spin
splitting in magnetic fields. The exciton, electron and hole carrier g-factors
provide information on the band structure, including its anisotropy, and the
parameters contributing to the electron and hole effective masses. We measure
g_X by reflectivity in magnetic fields up to 60 T for lead halide perovskite
crystals. The materials band gap energies at a liquid helium temperature vary
widely across the visible spectral range from 1.520 up to 3.213 eV in hybrid
organic-inorganic and fully inorganic perovskites with different cations and
halogens: FA_{0.9}Cs_{0.1}PbI_{2.8}Br_{0.2], MAPbI_{3}, FAPbBr_{3}, CsPbBr_{3},
and MAPb(Br_{0.05}Cl_{0.95})_{3}. We find the exciton g-factors to be nearly
constant, ranging from +2.3 to +2.7. Thus, the strong dependences of the
electron and hole g-factors on the band gap roughly compensate each other when
combining to the exciton g-factor. The same is true for the anisotropies of the
carrier g-factors, resulting in a nearly isotropic exciton g-factor. The
experimental data are compared favorably with model calculation results.

<h3>Vibrationally Induced Magnetism in Supramolecular Aggregates</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic phenomena are in chemistry and condensed matter physics considered
to be associated with low temperatures. That a magnetic state, or order, is
stable below a critical temperature as well as becoming stronger the lower the
temperature is a nearly unquestioned paradigm. It is, therefore, surprising
that recent experimental observation made on supramolecular aggregates suggest
that, for instance, the magnetic coercivity may increase with increasing
temperature, as well as the chiral induced spin selectivity effect may be
enhanced. Here, a mechanism for vibrationally stabilized magnetism is proposed
and a theoretical model is introduced with which the qualitative aspects of the
recent experimental findings can be explained. It is argued that anharmonic
vibrations, which become increasingly occupied with increasing temperature,
enables nuclear vibrations to both stabilize and sustain magnetic states. The
theoretical proposal, hence, pertains to structures without inversion and/or
reflection symmetries, for instance, chiral molecules and crystals.

Closed shell molecular structures are under normal conditions time-reversal
invariant. Experimental evidences point, however, towards that this invariance
may be locally violated when the structure is in contact with a particle
reservoir. The mechanisms behind such local symmetry breaking are not clear by
any means. By considering a minimal model for a closed shell structure, here we
propose that the symmetry breaking may result from a combination of internal
and/or external interactions. It is shown that a magnetic moment of a localized
electron level can be generated and maintained under the influence of such
combination. The theoretical results should cast new light on the mechanisms
that may form magnetic properties in molecular compounds.

Computational material modeling using advanced numerical techniques speeds up
the design process and reduces the costs of developing new engineering
products. In the field of multiscale modeling, huge computation efforts are
expected for modeling heterogeneous materials while trying to reach high
accuracy levels. In this work, a machine learning approach, namely the
convolutional neural network (CNN), is developed as a solution providing a high
level of accuracy, while being computationally efficient. The input for the CNN
model consists of two-/three-dimensional images of artificial periodic and
biphasic microstructures in the form of nonoverlapping and overlapping, mono-
and polydisperse circular/spherical disk systems, which are generated by a
random sequential inhibition process. These correspond to Statistical Volume
Elements (SVE). Considering linear magnetostatics at the microscale, the output
is the apparent permeability of the SVE. Training and testing data for the
apparent properties is produced with finite element method-based two-scale
asymptotic homogenization. The model efficiency is revealed by employing some
representative examples in two- and three-dimensional settings. In this regard,
the performance of the CNN model is assessed with the applied computational
homogenization method relating to the accuracy and computational efficiency.
The results with the CNN model show high accuracy in predicting the homogenized
permeability and a significant decrease in computation time.

Using computer simulations, we have studied the percolation and the
electrical conductance of two-dimensional, random percolating networks of
curved, zero-width metallic nanowires. We mimicked the curved nanowires using
circular arcs. The percolation threshold decreased as the aspect ratio of the
arcs increased. Comparison with published data on the percolation threshold of
symmetric quadratic B\'{e}zier curves suggests that, when the percolation of
slightly curved wires is simulated, the particular choice of curve to mimic the
shape of real-world wires is of little importance. Considering the electrical
properties, we took into account both the nanowire resistance per unit length
and the junction (nanowire/nanowire contact) resistance. Using a mean-field
approximation (MFA), we derived the total electrical conductance of the
nanowire-based networks as a function of their geometrical and physical
parameters. The MFA predictions have been confirmed by our Monte Carlo
numerical simulations. For our random homogeneous and isotropic systems of
conductive curved wires, the electric conductance decreased as the wire shape
changed from a stick to a ring when the wire length remained fixed.

<h3>Investigation of Ultrafast Demagnetization and Gilbert Damping and their  Correlation in Different Ferromagnetic Thin Films Grown Under Identical  Conditions</h3>

<i>Suchetana Mukhopadhyay, Sudip Majumder, Surya Narayan Panda, Anjan Barman</i>
<br>
<br>
Following the demonstration of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization in
ferromagnetic nickel, several theoretical and phenomenological propositions
have sought to uncover its underlying physics. In this work we revisit the
three temperature model (3TM) and the microscopic three temperature model
(M3TM) to perform a comparative analysis of ultrafast demagnetization in
20-nm-thick cobalt, nickel and permalloy thin films measured using an
all-optical pump-probe technique. In addition to the ultrafast dynamics at the
femtosecond timescales, the nanosecond magnetization precession and damping are
recorded at various pump excitation fluences revealing a fluence-dependent
enhancement in both the demagnetization times and the damping factors. We
confirm that the Curie temperature to magnetic moment ratio of a given system
acts as a figure of merit for the demagnetization time, while the
demagnetization times and damping factors show an apparent sensitivity to the
density of states at the Fermi level for a given system. Further, from
numerical simulations of the ultrafast demagnetization based on both the 3TM
and the M3TM, we extract the reservoir coupling parameters that best reproduce
the experimental data and estimate the value of the spin flip scattering
probability for each system. We discuss how the fluence-dependence of
inter-reservoir coupling parameters so extracted may reflect a role played by
nonthermal electrons in the magnetization dynamics at low laser fluences.

<h3>Information dynamics emerging from memory and adaptation in  non-equilibrium sensing of living systems</h3>

<br>

Living systems process information at different scales and exhibit dynamical
adaptation to their environment. Informed both by experimental observations and
theoretical constraints, we propose a chemical model for sensing that
incorporates energy consumption, information storage, and negative feedback. We
show that these minimal mechanisms lead to the emergence of dynamical memory
and adaptation. Crucially, adaptation is associated with both an increase in
the mutual information between external and internal variables and a reduction
of dissipation of the internal chemical processes. By simultaneously optimizing
energy consumption and information dynamical features, we find that
far-from-equilibrium sensing dominates in the low-noise regime. Our results, in
principle, can be declined at different biological scales. We employ our model
to shed light on large-scale neural adaptation in zebrafish larvae under
repeated visual stimulation. We find striking similarities between predicted
and observed behaviors, capturing the emergent adaptation of neural response.
Our framework draws a path toward the unraveling of the essential ingredients
that link information processing, adaptation, and memory in living systems.

<br>
<br>
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with sub-micrometer spatial
resolution ({\mu}-ARPES), has become a powerful tool for studying quantum
materials. To achieve sub-micrometer or even nanometer-scale spatial
resolution, it is important to focus the incident light beam (usually from the
synchrotron radiation) using X-ray optics such as the zone plate or ellipsoidal
capillary mirrors. Recently, we developed a laser-based {\mu}-ARPES with
spin-resolution (LMS-ARPES). The 177 nm laser beam is achieved by frequency
doubling a 355 nm beam using a KBBF crystal and subsequently focused using an
optical lens with a focal length of about 16 mm. By characterizing the focused
spot size using different methods and performing spatial-scanning photoemission
measurement, we confirm the sub-micron spatial resolution of the system.
Compared with the {\mu}-ARPES facilities based on synchrotron radiation, our
LMS-ARPES system is not only more economical and convenient but also with
higher photon flux (> 5E13 photons/s), thus enabling the high-resolution and
high-statistics measurements. Moreover, the system is equipped with a
two-dimensional spin detector based on exchange scattering at a
surface-passivated iron film grown on a W(100) substrate. We investigate the
spin structure of the prototype topological insulator Bi2Se3 and reveal a high
spin-polarization rate, confirming its spin-momentum locking property. This
lab-based LMS-ARPES will be a powerful research tool for studying the local
fine electronic structures of different condensed matter systems, including
topological quantum materials, mesoscopic materials and structures, and
phase-separated materials.

Transition metal diborides crystallise in the $\alpha$, $\gamma$, or $\omega$
type structure, in which pure transition metal layers alternate with pure boron
layers stacked along the hexagonal [0001] axis. Here we view the prototypes as
different stackings of the transition metal planes and suppose they can
transform from one into another by a displacive transformation. Employing
first-principles calculations, we simulate sliding of individual planes in the
group IV-VII transition metal diborides along a transformation pathway
connecting the $\alpha$, $\gamma$, and $\omega$ structure. Chemistry-related
trends are predicted in terms of energetic and structural changes along a
transformation pathway, together with mechanical and dynamical stability of the
different stackings. Our results suggest that MnB$_2$ and MoB$_2$ possess the
overall lowest sliding barriers among the investigated TMB$_2$s.

Lorentz symmetry is commonly assumed to be an intrinsic requirement of the
(2+1)d deconfined quantum phase transition (DQPT), and the conformal field
theory (CFT) can be utilized. The dynamics of DQPT in the Kagome lattice are
explored by using a combination of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations
and stochastic analytic continuation. In the valence-bonded solid phase, the
fragmentation of a nearly flat band with a finite energy gap is observed around
the K point. At the deconfined quantum critical point, besides the linear
dispersion at the $\Gamma$ point, another one is found at the K point.
Counterintuitively, these two gapless modes take different speeds equal to
0.319(8) and 0.101(9), indicating the absence of Lorentz symmetry. After
carefully inspecting the snapshot of the simulation, we discovered the fast
mode at $\Gamma$ point corresponding to the deconfinement of spinons
(fractional charges), and the slow mode at K point is related to the quantum
string ( generalized symmetry). Our work will extend the understanding of phase
transition, and intrigue the field of topological quantum field theory.

with the dot semiconductor. The resulting radial electron-hole separation is
evidenced by several distinct effects which occur in the presence of ZnSe
shell, including: the optical emission redshift of about 250 meV, a significant
decrease of the emission intensity, the increase of the excitonic lifetime by
one order of magnitude and the increase of the biexciton binding energy. The
type II nanowire quantum dots where electrons and holes are radially separated

<h3>Clausius Implies That Nearly Anything Can Be A Thermometer</h3>

<br>
<i>Wayne M. Saslow</i>
<br>
<br>
There are three types of thermometries. Two are proxies, such as the purely
phenomenological resistivity, and those based on statistical mechanics, such as
the ideal gas law. The third type is a class of previously described
thermodynamic temperature scales based on Clausius and heat flow $dQ$. Such
temperature scales are determined by heat inputs $dQ$ satisfying the Clausius
condition $\oint dQ/T = 0$ for every closed path in a given region $\Omega$ of
$p,V$ space. Thus any stable material can be used as a thermometer. Although a
discretized grid $i$ (from which such paths can be composed) leaves $T(p,V)$
underdetermined, even after a temperature $T_0(p_0,V_0)$ is specified, the
temperature $T(p,V)$ everywhere within $\Omega$ can be determined by a
root-mean-square minimization of $\sum_{i} (\oint_i dQ/T_n)^2$ for some trial
temperature function $T_n$. If the Clausius-based method gives a temperature
scale of lower accuracy than the best proxy temperature scale, then that proxy
temperature scale can be employed with the rms Clausius condition method to
improve the accuracy of (i.e., raise the standards for) the dQ measurements to
the accuracy of the proxy-based temperature scale.

<br>
<br>
Low-frequency 1/f noise in electronics is a conductance fluctuation, that has
been expressed in terms of a mobility "$\alpha$-noise" by Hooge and
Kleinpenning. Understanding this noise in graphene is a key towards
high-performance electronics. Early investigations in diffusive graphene have
pointed out a deviation from the standard Hooge formula, with a modified
expression where the free-carrier density is substituted by a constant density
$n_\Delta\sim10^{12}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We investigate hBN-encapsulated
graphene transistors where high mobility gives rise to the non-linear
velocity-saturation regime. In this regime, the $\alpha$-noise is accounted for
by substituting conductance by differential conductance $G$, ressulting in a
bell-shape dependence of flicker noise with bias voltage $V$. The same analysis
holds at larger bias in the Zener regime, with two main differences: the first
one is a strong enhancement of the Hooge parameter reflecting the hundred-times
larger coupling of interband excitations to the hyperbolic phonon-polariton
(HPhP) modes of the mid-infrared Reststrahlen (RS) bands of hBN. The second is
an exponential suppression of this coupling at large fields, which we attribute
to decoherence effects. We also show that the HPhP bands control the amplitude
of flicker noise according to the graphene-hBN thermal coupling estimated with
microwave noise thermometry. The phenomenology of $\alpha$-noise in graphene
supports a quantum-coherent bremsstrahlung interpretation of flicker noise.

Intracellular fluids can self-organize into phase-separated condensates as a
result of evolved biomolecular interactions. However, the extent to which the
equilibrium phase behavior of a complex fluid can be controlled by tuning such
interactions remains unclear. Here we apply convex optimization to design
fluids that demix into phases with prescribed compositions at thermodynamic
equilibrium. We then show how multicomponent phase diagrams can differ
qualitatively from those of simple fluids. Our approach enables the rational
design of multicomponent fluids with phase diagrams of arbitrary complexity.

In the usual perception, surface superconductivity is associated with the
surface nucleation of a superconducting condensate above the upper critical
field in type-II superconductors or with a rearrangement of phonon properties
and the electron-phonon coupling near surfaces/interfaces. Recently, it has
been found that there is another example when the surface superconducting
temperature is increased up to 20-25% as compared to the bulk one due to
constructive interference of superconducting pair states. In the present work,
we demonstrate that in fact, such an interferenceinduced enhancement can be
much more pronounced, up to nearly 70%. Furthermore, here it is shown that such
an interference enhancement persists over a wide range of microscopic
parameters.

We analyze the effect of circuit parameter variation on the performance of
Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (JTWPAs). Specifically, the
JTWPA concept we investigate is using flux-biased nonhysteretic rf-SQUIDs in a
transmission line configuration, which harnesses the three-wave mixing (3WM)
regime. Dispersion engineering enables phasematching to achieve power gain of
$\sim$20 dB, while suppressing the generation of unwanted mixing processes. Two
dispersion engineering concepts using a 3WM-JTWPA circuit model, i.e., resonant
phase-matching (RPM) and periodic capacitance modulation (PCM), are discussed,
with results potentially also applicable to four-wave-mixing (4WM) JTWPAs. We
propose suitable circuit parameter sets and evaluate amplifier performance with
and without circuit parameter variance using transient circuit simulations.
This approach inherently takes into account microwave reflections, unwanted
mixing products, imperfect phasematching, pump depletion, etc. In the case of
RPM the resonance frequency spread is critical, while PCM is much less
sensitive to parameter spread. We discuss degrees of freedom to make the JTWPA
circuits more tolerant to parameter spread. Finally, our analysis shows that
the flux-bias point where rf-SQUIDs exhibit Kerr-free nonlinearity is close to
the sweet spot regarding critical current spread.

S(x,z)\vert^2\psi(x,z)$, where $S(x,z)$ is a complex Gaussian random field, $z$
and $x$ respectively are the axial and transverse coordinates, with $0\le z\le
L$, and both $m\ne 0$ and $g>0$ are real parameters. We perform the first
instanton analysis of the corresponding Martin-Siggia-Rose action, from which
it is found that the realizations of $S$ concentrate onto long filamentary
instantons, as $U\to +\infty$. The tail of $p(U)$ is deduced from the
statistics of the instantons. The critical value of $g$ above which $\langle
U\rangle$ diverges is checked to coincide with the one obtained by the
completely different approach developed in Mounaix et al. 2006 {\it Commun.
Math. Phys.} {\bf 264} 741 (and Erratum 2008 {\it Commun. Math. Phys.} {\bf
280} 281). Analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations that
clearly show the statistical bias of $S$ towards the instanton, at large $U$.
For the biased realizations of $S$, the high maxima -- or `hot spots' -- of
$\vert S(x,z)\vert^2$ tend to cluster in the instanton region.

<h3>Heavy quasiparticles and cascades without symmetry breaking in twisted  bilayer graphene</h3>

Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits a plethora of electronic phases.
Among the variety of correlated states, the cascades in the spectroscopic
properties and in the compressibility happen in a much larger energy, twist
angle and temperature range than other effects, pointing to a hierarchy of
phenomena. In this work, by applying a self-consistent Dynamical Mean Field
Theory + Hartree approximation to a multi-orbital model for TBG, we show that
the spectral weight reorganization associated to the formation of local moments
and heavy quasiparticles, and not a symmetry breaking process, is responsible
for the cascade phenonema. Due to the fragile topology of TBG, a strong
momentum differentiation is found in the incoherent spectral weight. The
phenomena reproduced here include the cascade flow of spectral weight, the
oscillations of the remote band energies and the asymmetric jumps of the
inverse compressibility.

<h3>The destiny of obstructed atomic insulator under correlation</h3>

The obstructed atomic insulators are insulators with both atomic limits and
boundary states. In this work, we study the obstructed atomic insulators under
correlation. We use the symmetry indicators by constructing many-body
wavefunctions in momentum space to prove the obstruction properties in
different models including the SSH chain, anisotropic square lattice model, the
quadrupole insulator model and etc. We demonstrate that the obstruction
properties with boundary modes persist at large $U$ where the charge freedom is
well-gapped, namely, this insulator phase can smoothly connect to its Mott
phase without Mott transition.

<h3>Mean-field theory is exact for Ising spin glass models with Kac  potential in non-additive limit on Nishimori line</h3>

<br>
<i>Manaka Okuyama, Masayuki Ohzeki</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, Mori [Phys. Rev. E 84, 031128 (2011)] has conjectured that the free
energy of Ising spin glass models with the Kac potential in the non-additive
limit, such as the power-law potential in the non-additive regime, is exactly
equal to that of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the thermodynamic limit.
In this study, we prove that his conjecture is true on the Nishimori line at
any temperature in any dimension. One of the key ingredients of the proof is
the use of the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality on the Nishimori line. We also
consider the case in which the probability distribution of the interaction is
symmetric, where his conjecture is true at any temperature in one dimension but
is an open problem in the low-temperature regime in two or more dimensions.

We report the growth of $\alpha-Ga_2O_3$ on $m$-plane $Al_2O_3$ by
conventional plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and In-mediated
metal-oxide-catalyzed epitaxy (MOCATAXY). We report a growth-rate-diagram for
$\alpha-Ga_2O_3$ (10-10), and observe (i) a growth rate increase, (ii) an
expanded growth window, and (iii) reduced out-of-lane mosaic spread when
MOCATAXY is employed for the growth of $\alpha-Ga_2O_3$. Through the use of
In-mediated catalysis, growth rates over $0.2\,\mu\text{m}\,\text{hr}^{-1}$ and
rocking curves with full width at half maxima of $\Delta\omega \approx
0.45^{\circ}$ are achieved. Faceting is observed along the $\alpha-Ga_2O_3$
film surface and is explored through scanning transmission electron microscopy.

<h3>Ensemble dependence of information-theoretic contributions to the  entropy production</h3>

The entropy production of an open system coupled to a reservoir initialized
in a canonical state can be expressed as a sum of two microscopic
information-theoretic contributions: the system-bath mutual information and the
relative entropy measuring the displacement of the environment from
equilibrium. We investigate whether this result can be generalized to
situations where the reservoir is initialized in a microcanonical or in a
certain pure state (e.g., an eigenstate of a nonintegrable system), such that
the reduced dynamics and thermodynamics of the system are the same as for the
thermal bath. We show that while in such a case the entropy production can
still be expressed as a sum of the mutual information between the system and
the bath and a properly redefined displacement term, the relative weight of
those contributions depends on the initial state of the reservoir. In other
words, different statistical ensembles for the environment predicting the same
reduced dynamics for the system give rise to the same total entropy production
but to different information-theoretic contributions to the entropy production.

<br>
Photon Bose-Einstein condensation and photon thermalisation have been largely
studied with molecular gain media in optical cavities. Their observation with
semiconductors has remained elusive despite a large body of experimental
results and a very well established theoretical framework. We use this
theoretical framework as a convenient platform to revisit photon Bose-Einstein
condensation in the driven-dissipative regime and compare with the lasing
regime. We discuss the thermalisation figures of merit and the different
experimental procedures to asses thermalization. We compare the definitions of
lasing and condensation thresholds. Finally, we explore the fluctuations of the
system and their relation to the different regimes.

<h3>A sluggish random walk with subdiffusive spread</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a one-dimensional sluggish random walk with space-dependent
transition probabilities. Motivated by trap models of slow dynamics, we
consider a model in which the trap depth increases logarithmically with
distance from the origin. This leads to a random walk which has symmetric
transition probabilities that decrease with distance $|k|$ from the origin as
$1/|k|$ for large $|k|$. We show that the typical position after time $t$
scales as $t^{1/3}$ with a nontrivial scaling function for the position
distribution which has a trough (a cusp singularity) at the origin. Therefore
biased random motion emerges even though the transition probabilities are
symmetric. We also compute the survival probability of the walker in the
presence of a sink at the origin and show that it decays as $t^{-1/3}$ at late
times. Furthermore we compute the distribution of the maximum position, $M(t)$,
to the right of the origin up to time $t$, and show that it has a nontrivial
scaling function. Finally we provide a generalisation of this model where the
transition probabilities decay as $1/|k|^\alpha$ with $\alpha >0$.

<br>
<br>
Hematite is a canted antiferromagnetic insulator, promising for applications
in spintronics. Here, we present ab initio calculations of the tensorial
exchange interactions of hematite and use them to understand its magnetic
properties by parameterizing a semiclassical Heisenberg spin model. Using
atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we calculate the equilibrium properties
and phase transitions of hematite, most notably the Morin transition. The
computed isotropic and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions result in a N\'eel
temperature and weak ferromagnetic canting angle that are in good agreement
with experimental measurements. Our simulations show how dipole-dipole
interactions act in a delicate balance with first and higher-order on-site
anisotropies to determine the material's magnetic phase. Comparison with
spin-Hall magnetoresistance measurements on a hematite single-crystal reveals
deviations of the critical behavior at low temperatures. Based on a mean-field
model, we argue that these differences result from the quantum nature of the
fluctuations that drive the phase transitions.

<h3>Charge density wave-templated spin cycloid in topological semimetal  $NdSb_{x}Te_{2-x-δ}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic topological semimetals present open questions regarding the
interplay of crystal symmetry, magnetism, band topology, and electron
correlations. $LnSb_{x}Te_{2-x-\delta}$ (Ln= lanthanide) is a family of
square-net-derived topological semimetals that allows compositional control of
band filling, and access to different topological states via an evolving charge
density wave (CDW) distortion. Previously studied Gd and Ce members containing
a CDW have shown complex magnetic phase diagrams, which implied that spins
localized on Ln interact with the CDW, but to this date, no magnetic structures
have been solved within the CDW regime of this family of compounds. Here, we
report on the interplay of the CDW with magnetism in $NdSb_{x}Te_{2-x-\delta}$,
by comparing the undistorted square net member $NdSb_{0.94}Te_{0.92}$ with the
CDW-distorted phase $NdSb_{0.48}Te_{1.37}$, via single-crystal x-ray
diffraction, magnetometry, heat capacity, and neutron powder diffraction.
$NdSb_{0.94}Te_{0.92}$ is a collinear antiferromagnet with $T_N$ $\sim$ 2.7 K,
where spins align antiparallel to each other, but parallel to the square net of
the nuclear structure. $NdSb_{0.48}Te_{1.37}$ exhibits a nearly five-fold
modulated CDW ($q_{CDW}=0.18b^*$), isostructural to other
$LnSb_{x}Te_{2-x-\delta}$ at similar x. $NdSb_{0.48}Te_{1.37}$ displays more
complex magnetism with $T_N = 2.3 K$, additional metamagnetic transitions, and
an elliptical cycloid magnetic structure with $q_{mag}=-0.41b^*$.The magnitudes
of $q_{CDW}$ and $q_{mag}$ exhibit a integer relationship,
$1+2q_{mag}=q_{CDW}$, implying a coupling between the CDW and magnetic
structure. Given that the CDW is localized within the nonmagnetic distorted
square net, we propose that conduction electrons "template" the spin modulation
via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction.

<h3>Improving the prediction of glassy dynamics by pinpointing the local  cage</h3>

<br>

The relationship between structure and dynamics in glassy fluids remains an
intriguing open question. Recent work has shown impressive advances in our
ability to predict local dynamics using structural features, most notably due
to the use of advanced machine learning techniques. Here we explore whether a
simple linear regression algorithm combined with intelligently chosen
structural order parameters can reach the accuracy of the current, most
advanced machine learning approaches for predicting dynamic propensity. To do
this we introduce a method to pinpoint the cage state of the initial
configuration -- i.e. the configuration consisting of the average particle
positions when particle rearrangement is forbidden. We find that, in comparison
to both the initial state and the inherent state, the structure of the cage
state is highly predictive of the long-time dynamics of the system. Moreover,
by combining the cage state information with the initial state, we are able to
predict dynamic propensities with unprecedentedly high accuracy over a broad
regime of time scales, including the caging regime.

We propose a novel way of modulating exceptional topology by implementing
Floquet engineering in non-hermitian (NH) systems. We introduce Floquet
exceptional topological insulator which results from shining light on a
conventional three-dimensional NH topological insulator. Lightmatter
interaction facilitates the quantum phases of matter to exhibit a novel
phenomenon, where, the point gaps in the bulk host surface states. These
distinct surface states either fill the point gap in the complex eigenspectrum
or exhibit exceptional points in the presence of a magnetic field. We also
highlight the existence of a quantum anomaly generated by photo-induced
modulation. The existence of the Floquet biorthogonal Chern number and spectral
winding number show that the momentum slices exhibit NH skin effect, even
though the system as a whole does not. We also employ wave-dynamics evolution
to illustrate the NH surface skin effect.

<h3>$H_{3}S$ is a high-$κ$ superconductor with columnar pinning defects</h3>

Recently, the existence of superconductivity in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ and other
high-pressure hydrides is called into question, because of some flawed magnetic
measurements. In Ref.[1] the SCPC model is proposed, where strong pinning of
vortices is due to long columnar defects in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ - with lengths
$\mathrm{L}$ of the order of vortex lengths $\mathrm{L_{v}}$. Two relevant type
of experiments in magnetic fields are explained by this model: (1) Reduction
(with respect to standard superconductors) of the thermal broadening of
resistance ($\mathit{TBR}$) in magnetic field $\mathrm{h=H/H_{c2}}$,
$\mathrm{\mathrm{\delta t_{c}(h)}}$, is governed by the small parameter
$\mathrm{C=}$$\mathrm{\xi_{0}}/\mathrm{L}$. The $\mathit{TBR}$ measurements
give, that in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ there is a large shift of the irreversible line
$\mathrm{B_{irr}(T)}$ towards the $\mathrm{B_{c2}(T)}$ line. (2) In ZFC (zero
field cooled) experiments on penetration of the magnetic field ($\mathit{PMF}$)
in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ [3], the latter reaches the center of a superconducting
disk at much larger external fields, i. e. for $\mathrm{B_{0}\gg B_{c1}}$. The
later is due to the pronounced pinning of vortices, but not to the Meissner
effect. The calculated $\mathrm{T}$- dependence of the penetrated,
perpendicular $\mathrm{B_{\perp}(T)}$ and parallel
$\mathrm{B_{\parallel}}(\mathrm{T})$, magnetic field into the sample is in
satisfactory agreement with the experimental results for $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ in
[3], where $\mathrm{B_{\perp}>B_{\parallel}}$. Problems related to measurements
of the Meissner effect in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ are also discussed. The SCPC model,
applied on the bulk $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ sample, predicts, that the latter is a
high-$\kappa$ superconductor.

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a bulk-processable quasi-amorphous 2D
material with broad spectral coverage and fast electronic response. rGO sheets
are suspended in a polymer matrix and sequentially photoreduced while measuring
the evolving optical spectra and ultrafast electron relaxation dynamics.
Photoreduced rGO yields optical absorption spectra that fit with the same Fano
lineshape parameters as monolayer graphene. With increasing photoreduction
time, rGO transient absorption kinetics accelerate monotonically, reaching an
optimal point that matches the hot electron cooling in graphene. All stages of
rGO ultrafast kinetics are simulated with a hot-electron cooling model mediated
by disorder-assisted supercollisions. While the rGO room temperature 0.31
ps$^{-1}$ electronic cooling rate matches monolayer graphene, subsequent
photoreduction can rapidly increase the rate by ~10-12$\times$. Such
accelerated supercollision rates imply a reduced mean-free scattering length
caused by photoionized point-defects on the rGO sp$^2$ sub-lattice. For visible
range excitations of rGO, photoreduction shows three increasing spectral peaks
that match graphene quantum dot (GQD) transitions, while a broad peak from
oxygenated defect edge states shrinks. These three confined GQD states donate
their hot carriers to the graphene sub-lattice with a 0.17 ps rise-time that
accelerates with photoreduction. Collectively, many desirable photophysical
properties of 2D graphene are replicated through selectively reducing rGO
scaffolded within a 3D bulk polymeric network.

<h3>Effect of crystal field engineering and Fermi level optimization on  thermoelectric properties of Ge$_{1.01}$Te: Experimental investigation and  theoretical insight</h3>

This study shows a method of enhancing the thermoelectric properties of
GeTe-based materials by Ti and Bi co-doping on cation sites along with
self-doping with Ge via simultaneous optimization of electronic (via crystal
field engineering, and precise Fermi level optimization) and thermal (via
point-defect scattering) transport properties. The pristine GeTe possesses high
carrier concentration ($n$) due to intrinsic Ge vacancies, low Seebeck
coefficient ($\alpha$), and high thermal conductivity ($\kappa$). The Ge
vacancy optimization and crystal field engineering results in an enhanced
$\alpha$ via excess Ge and Ti doping, which is further improved by band
structure engineering through Bi doping. As a result of improved $\alpha$ and
optimized Fermi level (carrier concentration), an enhanced power factor
($\alpha^2\sigma$) is obtained for Ti--Bi co-doped Ge$_{1.01}$Te. These
experimental results are also evidenced by theoretical calculations of band
structure, and thermoelectric parameters using density functional theory and
Boltztrap calculations, respectively. A significant reduction in the phonon
thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$) from $\sim$ 3.5 W.m$^{-1}$.K$^{-1}$ to
$\sim$ 1.06 W.m$^{-1}$.K$^{-1}$ at 300\,K for Ti--Bi co-doping in GeTe,
attributed to point-defect scattering due to mass and strain field fluctuation,
in line with the Debye-Callaway model. The phonon dispersion calculations show
a decreasing group velocity in Ti--Bi co-doped GeTe, supporting the obtained
reduced $\kappa_{ph}$. The strategies used in the present study can
significantly increase the effective mass, optimize the carrier concentration,
and decrease phonon thermal conductivity while achieving an impressive maximum
zT value of 1.75 at 773\,K and average zT (zT$_{av}$) of 1.03 for
Ge$_{0.91}$Ti$_{0.02}$Bi$_{0.08}$Te over a temperature range of 300-773\,K.
