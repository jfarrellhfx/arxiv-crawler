<h3>Effect of Spin Orbit Coupling in non-centrosymmetric half-Heusler alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03760" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03760</a>
<br>
<i>Kunal Dutta, Subhadeep Bandyopadhyay, Indra Dasgupta</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit coupled electronic structure of two representative non-polar
half-Heusler alloys, namely 18 electron compound CoZrBi and 8 electron compound
SiLiIn have been studied in details. An excursion through the Brillouin zone of
these alloys from one high symmetry point to the other revealed rich local
symmetry of the associated wave vectors resulting in non-trivial spin splitting
of the bands and consequent diverse spin textures in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling. Our first principles calculations supplemented with low energy
$\boldsymbol{k.p}$ model Hamiltonian revealed the presence of linear
Dresselhaus effect at the X point having $D_{2d}$ symmetry and Rashba effect
with both linear and non-linear terms at the L point with $C_{3v}$ point group
symmetry. Interestingly we have also identified non-trivial Zeeman spin
splitting at the non-time reversal invariant W point and a pair of
non-degenerate bands along the path $\Gamma$ to L displaying vanishing spin
polarization due to the non-pseudo polar point group symmetry of the wave
vectors. Further a comparative study of CoZrBi and SiLiIn suggest, in addition,
to the local symmetry of the wave vectors, important role of the participating
orbitals in deciding the nature and strength of spin splitting. Our
calculations identify half-Heusler compounds with heavy elements displaying
diverse spin textures may be ideal candidate for spin valleytronics where spin
textures can be controlled by accessing different valleys around the high
symmetry k-points.

<h3>Rotation and Oblique Irradiation Effects on Phototactic Algal Suspension  Instability</h3>

In this study, we aim to explore the behavior of microorganisms in response
to natural lighting conditions, considering the off-normal angles at which the
sun strikes the Earth's surface. To achieve this, we investigate the effect of
oblique irradiation on a rotating medium, as this combination represents a more
realistic scenario in the natural environment. Our primary focus is on
understanding the phototactic behavior of microorganisms, which refers to their
movement towards or away from light. Under conditions of low light,
microorganisms tend to exhibit positive phototaxis, moving towards the light
source, while in intense light, they display negative phototaxis, moving away
from the light source. By studying a suspension that is illuminated by oblique
collimated flux with a constant radiation intensity applied to the top surface,
we can gain insights into how microorganisms respond to varying light
conditions and rotation. The stability analysis is conducted using linear
perturbation theory, which allows us to predict both the stationary and
oscillatory characteristics of the bio-convective instability at the onset of
bioconvection. Through this analysis, we observe that rotation plays a
significant stabilizing role in the system, while oblique irradiation has a
destabilizing effect on the suspension.

Honeycomb layered frameworks with metallophilic bilayers have garnered
traction in various disciplines due to their unique configuration and numerous
physicochemical and topological properties, such as fast ionic conduction,
coordination chemistry, and structural defects. These properties make them
attractive for energy storage applications, leading to increased attention
towards their metallophilic bilayer arrangements. This Review focuses on recent
advancements in this field, including characterisation techniques like X-ray
absorption spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,
particularly for silver-based oxides. It also highlights strategies related to
cationic-deficient phases induced by topology or temperature, expanding the
compositional space of honeycomb layered frameworks with a focus on cationic
bilayer architectures. The Review further discusses theoretical approaches for
understanding the bilayered structure, especially concerning critical phenomena
at the monolayer-bilayer phase transition. Honeycomb layered frameworks are
described as optimised lattices within the congruent sphere packing problem,
equivalent to a specific two-dimensional conformal field theory. The
monolayer-bilayer phase transition involves a 2D-to-3D crossover. Overall, this
Review aims to provide a panoramic view of honeycomb layered frameworks with
metallophilic bilayers and their potential applications in the emerging field
of quantum matter. It is valuable for recent graduates and experts alike across
diverse fields, extending beyond materials science and chemistry.

Recently, two arXiv preprints (arXiv:2307.12008, arXiv:2307.12037) reported
signatures of superconductivity above room temperature and at ambient pressure,
striking worldwide experimental research efforts to replicate the results3-7,
as well as theoretical attempts to explain the purported superconductivity8-12.
The material of interest has chemical formula Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O,
where $x \approx 1$, and was named by the authors as LK-99. It belongs to lead
apatite family, and was synthesised from two precursors, lanarkite
(PbSO$_4\cdot$PbO) and copper phosphide (Cu$_3$P). Here we performed a
systematic study on LK-99, starting from solid-state synthesis, followed by
characterisation and transport measurements. We did not observe any signatures
of superconductivity in our samples of LK-99.

<h3>Emergence of nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles across the transition from  the pseudogap metal to the d-wave superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03835</a>

We model the pseudogap state of the hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a
metal with hole and/or electron pocket Fermi surfaces. In the absence of
long-range antiferromagnetism, such Fermi surfaces violate the Luttinger
requirement of enclosing the same area as free electrons at the same density.
Using the Ancilla theory of such a pseudogap state, we describe the onset of
conventional $d$-wave superconductivity by the condensation of a charge e Higgs
boson transforming as a fundamental under the emergent SU(2) gauge symmetry of
a background $\pi$-flux spin liquid. In all cases, we find that the $d$-wave
superconductor has gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points on the
Brillouin zone diagonals with significant velocity anisotropy, just as in the
BCS state. This includes the case of the electron-doped pseudogap metal with
only electron pockets centered at wavevectors $(\pi, 0)$, $(0, \pi)$, and an
electronic gap along the zone diagonals. Remarkably, in this case too, gapless
nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge within the gap at 4 points along the
zone diagonals upon the onset of superconductivity.

<h3>Edge states of 2D time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors  with strong interactions and disorder: A view from the lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03836" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03836</a>
<br>
<i>Jun Ho Son, Jason Alicea, Olexei I. Motrunich</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors host
helical Majorana fermions at their boundary. We study the fate of these edge
states under the combined influence of strong interactions and disorder, using
the effective 1D lattice model for the edge introduced by Jones and Metlitski
[Phys. Rev. B 104, 245130 (2021)]. We specifically develop a strong-disorder
renormalization group analysis of the lattice model and identify a regime in
which time-reversal is broken spontaneously, creating random magnetic domains;
Majorana fermions localize to domain walls and form an infinite-randomness
fixed point, identical to that appearing in the random transverse-field Ising
model. While this infinite-randomness fixed point describes a fine-tuned
critical point in a purely 1D system, in our edge context there is no obvious
time-reversal-preserving perturbation that destabilizes the fixed point. Our
analysis thus suggests that the infinite-randomness fixed point emerges as a
stable phase on the edge of 2D topological superconductors when strong disorder
and interactions are present.

<h3>Strongly Interacting Phases in Twisted Bilayer Graphene at the Magic  Angle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03843</a>
<br>
<i>Khagendra Adhikari, Kangjun Seo, K. S. D. Beach, Bruno Uchoa</i>
<br>
<br>
Twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle is known to have a cascade of
insulating phases at integer filling factors of the low-energy bands. In this
Letter we address the nature of these phases through an unrestricted,
self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation on the lattice that accounts for
\emph{all} electronic bands. Using numerically unbiased methods, we show that
Coulomb interactions screened only by metallic gates produce ferromagnetic
insulating states at integer fillings $\nu\in[-4,4]$ with maximal spin
polarization $M_{\text{FM}}=4-|\nu|$. With the exception of the $\nu=0,-2$
states, all other integer fillings have insulating phases with additional
sublattice symmetry breaking and antiferromagnetism in the \emph{remote} bands.
Valley polarization is found away from half filling. Odd filling factors
$|\nu|=1,3$ have anomalous quantum Hall states with Chern number
$|\mathcal{C}|=1$, whereas the $|\nu|=3$ states show strong particle-hole
\emph{asymmetry} in the small-gap regime. We map the metal-insulator
transitions of these phases as a function of the background dielectric
constant.

<h3>Measurement induced criticality in quasiperiodic modulated random hybrid  circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03844</a>
<br>
<i>Gal Shkolnik, Aidan Zabalo, Romain Vasseur, David A. Huse, J. H. Pixley, Snir Gazit</i>
<br>
<br>
We study one-dimensional hybrid quantum circuits perturbed by quenched
quasiperiodic (QP) modulations across the measurement-induced phase transition
(MIPT). Considering non-Pisot QP structures, characterized by unbounded
fluctuations, allows us to tune the wandering exponent $\beta$ to exceed the
Luck bound $\nu \ge 1/(1-\beta)$ for the stability of the MIPT where $\nu\cong
4/3$. Via large-scale numerical simulations of random Clifford circuits
interleaved with local projective measurements, we find that sufficiently large
QP structural fluctuations destabilize the MIPT and induce a flow to a broad
family of critical dynamical phase transitions of the infinite QP type that is
governed by the wandering exponent, $\beta$. We numerically determine the
associated critical properties, including the correlation length exponent
consistent with saturating the Luck bound, and a universal activated dynamical
scaling with activation exponent $\psi \cong \beta$, finding excellent
agreement with the conclusions of real space renormalization group
calculations.

<h3>Attractive Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard Model on a Square Lattice Away  from Half-Filling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03846</a>
<br>
<i>Bo Xing, Chunhan Feng, Richard Scalettar, G. George Batrouni, Dario Poletti</i>
<br>
<br>
The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, with bond phonons modulating electron
tunneling, is a paradigmatic electron-phonon model that hosts an
antiferromagnetic order to bond order transition at half-filling. In the
presence of repulsive Hubbard interaction, the antiferromagnetic phase is
enhanced, but the phase transition remains first-order. Here we explore the
physics of the SSH model with attractive Hubbard interaction, which hosts an
interesting interplay among charge order, s-wave pairing, and bond order. Using
the numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we show that both
charge order, present at weak electron-phonon coupling, and bond order, at
large coupling, give way to s-wave pairing when the system is doped.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SSH electron-phonon interaction competes
with the attractive Hubbard interaction and reduces the s-wave pairing
correlation.

<h3>Quantum Carousel: The Fate of a Bound State Attached to a Linear Rotor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03852" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03852</a>
<br>
<i>Tibor Dome, Artem G. Volosniev, Areg Ghazaryan, Laleh Safari, Richard Schmidt, Mikhail Lemeshko</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the angulon problem -- a linear rotor in a bosonic bath -- in the
regime where attractive impurity-boson interactions can support a shallow bound
state. To study the fate of the angulon in the vicinity of bound-state
formation, we formulate a beyond-linear-coupling model. First, we consider
attractive, spherically symmetric impurity-boson interactions for which the
linear rotor can be mapped onto a static impurity. The well-known polaron
formalism provides an adequate description in this limit. For anisotropic
potentials, the presence of a shallow bound state with pronounced anisotropic
character leads to a many-body instability that washes out the angulon
dynamics.

Phyllosilicates emerge as a promising class of large bandgap lamellar
insulators. Their applications have been explored from fabrication of
graphene-based devices to 2D heterostructures based on transition metal
dicalcogenides with enhanced optical and polaritonics properties. In this
review, we provide an overview on the use of IR s-SNOM for studying nano-optics
and local chemistry of a variety of 2D natural phyllosilicates. Finally, we
bring a brief update on applications that combine natural lamellar minerals
into multifunctional nanophotonic devices driven by electrical control.

<h3>Hall Coefficient and Resistivity in the Doped Bilayer Hubbard Model</h3>

Finding and understanding non-Fermi liquid transport behaviors are at the
core of condensed matter physics. Most of the existing studies were devoted to
the monolayer Hubbard model, which is the simplest model that captures
essential features of high-temperature superconductivity. Here we discover a
new type of non-Fermi liquid behavior emergent in the hole-doped bilayer
Hubbard model, using dynamical mean-field theory with a full consideration of
the short-range interlayer electron correlation. We find that at low
temperatures, the Hall coefficient has a strong nonmonotonic dependence on
temperature, leading to a double or quadruple reversal of its sign depending on
the doping level. At the same time, the resistivity exhibits two plateaus
rather than linearity in its temperature dependence. We show that these
intriguing transport behaviors stem from the formation of coherent interlayer
singlets, which scatter off gapped collective modes arising from short-range
interlayer antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

<h3>A first-principles approach to closing the "10-100 eV gap" for  charge-carrier thermalization in semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03893" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03893</a>

The present work is concerned with studying accurately the energy-loss
processes that control the thermalization of hot electrons and holes that are
generated by high-energy radiation in wurtzite GaN, using an ab initio
approach. Current physical models of the nuclear/particle physics community
cover thermalization in the high-energy range (kinetic energies exceeding ~100
eV), and the electronic-device community has studied extensively carrier
transport in the low-energy range (below ~10 eV). However, the processes that
control the energy losses and thermalization of electrons and holes in the
intermediate energy range of about 10-100 eV (the "10-100 eV gap") are poorly
known. The aim of this research is to close this gap, by utilizing density
functional theory (DFT) to obtain the band structure and dielectric function of
GaN for energies up to about 100 eV. We also calculate charge-carrier
scattering rates for the major charge-carrier interactions (phonon scattering,
impact ionization, and plasmon emission), using the DFT results and first-order
perturbation theory. With this information, we study the thermalization of
electrons starting at 100 eV using the Monte Carlo method to solve the
semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. Full thermalization of electrons
and holes is complete within ~1 and 0.5 ps, respectively. Hot electrons
dissipate about 90% of their initial kinetic energy to the electron-hole gas
(90 eV) during the first ~0.1 fs, due to rapid plasmon emission and impact
ionization at high energies. The remaining energy is lost more slowly as phonon
emission dominates at lower energies (below ~10 eV). During the thermalization,
hot electrons generate pairs with an average energy of ~8.9 eV/pair (11-12
pairs per hot electron). Additionally, during the thermalization, the maximum
electron displacement from its original position is found to be on the order of
100 nm.

<h3>Chirality manipulation of ultrafast phase switchings in a correlated  CDW-Weyl semimetal</h3>

A recently emerging concept for quantum phase discovery is the controlled
gapping of linear band crossings in topological semimetals. For example,
achieving topological superconducting and charge-density-wave (CDW) gapping
could introduce Majorana zero modes and axion electrodynamics, respectively.
Light engineering of correlation gaps in topological materials provides a new
avenue of achieving exotic topological phases inaccessible by conventional
tuning methods such as doping and straining. Here we demonstrate a light
control of correlation gaps and ultrafast phase switchings in a model CDW and
polaron insulator (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I recently predicted to be an axion insulator.
Our ultrafast terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy reveals a two-step,
non-thermal melting of polarons and electronic CDW gap via studying the fluence
dependence of a {\em longitudinal} circular photogalvanic current. The
helicity-dependent photocurrent observed along the propagation of light reveals
continuous ultrafast switchings from the polaronic state, to the CDW (axion)
phase, and finally to a hidden Weyl phase as the pump fluence increases. Other
distinguishing features corroborating with the light-induced switchings
include: mode-selective coupling of coherent phonons to polaron and CDW
modulation, and the emergence of a {\em non-thermal} chiral photocurrent above
pump threshold of CDW-related phonons. The ultrafast chirality control of
correlated topological states revealed here is important to realize axion
electrodynamics and quantum computing.

<h3>Charge Polarization around Impurities in Strained Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03899" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03899</a>
<br>
<i>Mohamed M. Elsayed, Sang Wook Kim, Juan M. Vanegas, Valeri N. Kotov</i>
<br>
<br>
Introducing quasiparticle anisotropy in graphene via uniaxial strain has a
profound effect on the polarization charge density induced by external
impurities, both Coulomb and short-range. In particular the charge distribution
induced by a Coulomb impurity exhibits a power law tail modulated by a
strain-dependent admixture of angular harmonics. The appearance of distributed
charge is in sharp contrast to the response in pristine/isotropic graphene,
where for subcritical impurities the polarization charge is fully localized at
the impurity position. It is also interesting to note that our results are
obtained strictly at zero chemical potential, and the behavior is fundamentally
distinct from the typical Friedel oscillations observed at finite chemical
potential. For weak to moderate strain, the $d$-wave symmetry is dominant. The
presence of Dirac cone tilt, relevant to some 2D materials beyond graphene, can
also substantially affect the induced charge distribution. Finally we consider
impurities with short range potentials, and study the effect of strain on the
charge response. Our results were obtained in the continuum via perturbation
theory valid for weak (subcritical) potentials, and supported by numerical
lattice simulations based on density functional theory.

<h3>Mu-Metal Enhancement of Effects in Electromagnetic Fields Over Single  Emitters Near Topological Insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
We focus on the transmission and reflection coefficients of light in systems
involving of topological insulators (TI). Due to the electro-magnetic coupling
in TIs, new mixing coefficients emerge leading to new components of the
electromagnetic fields of propagating waves. We have discovered a simple
heterostructure that provides a 100-fold enhancement of the mixing coefficients
for TI materials. Such effect increases with the TI's wave impedance. We also
predict a transverse deviation of the Poynting vector due to these mixed
coefficients contributing to the radiative electromagnetic field of an electric
dipole. Given an optimal configuration of the dipole-TI system, this deviation
could amount to $0.18\%$ of the Poynting vector due to emission near not
topological materials, making this effect detectable.

<h3>Amorphous shear bands in crystalline materials as drivers of plasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03937</a>
<br>
<i>Xuanxin Hu, Nuohao Liu, Vrishank Jambur, Siamak Attarian, Ranran Su, Hongliang Zhang, Jianqi Xi, Hubin Luo, John Perepezko, Izabela Szlufarska</i>
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, the formation of amorphous shear bands (SBs) in crystalline
materials has been undesirable, because SBs can nucleate voids and act as
precursors to fracture. They also form as a final stage of accumulated damage.
Only recently SBs were found to form in undefected crystals, where they serve
as the primary driver of plasticity without nucleating voids. Here, we have
discovered trends in materials properties that determine when amorphous shear
bands will form and whether they will drive plasticity or lead to fracture. We
have identified the materials systems that exhibit SB deformation, and by
varying the composition, we were able to switch from ductile to brittle
behavior. Our findings are based on a combination of experimental
characterization and atomistic simulations, and they provide a potential
strategy for increasing toughness of nominally brittle materials.

<h3>High Temperature Superconductivity with Strong Correlations and  Disorder: Possible Relevance to Cu-doped Apatite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03948</a>
<br>
<i>Maciej Fidrysiak, Andrzej P. Kądzielawa, Józef Spałek</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the properties of topological strongly correlated superconductor
with bond disorder on triangular lattice and demonstrate that our theoretical
($t$-$J$-$U$) model exhibits some unique features of the Cu-doped apatite
$\mathrm{Pb_{10-\mathit{x}}Cu_\mathit{x}(PO_4)_{6}O}$. Namely, the paired state
appears only for carrier concentration $0.8 \lesssim x < 1$ and is followed by
a close-by phase separation into the superconducting and Mott insulating parts.
Furthermore, a moderate amount of the bond disorder ($\Delta t / t \lesssim 20
\%$) does not alter essentially the topology with robust Chern number $C=2$
which diminishes beyond that limit. A room-temperature superconductivity is
attainable only for the exchange to hopping ratio $J/|t| \ge 1$ if one takes
the bare bandwidth suggested by current DFT calculations. The admixture of
$s$-wave pairing component is induced by the disorder. The results have been
obtained within statistically consistent variational approximation (SGA).

<h3>Atomistic theory of hot carrier relaxation in large plasmonic  nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, there has been significant interest in harnessing hot carriers
generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic
nanoparticles for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics and sensing. In
this work, we present an atomistic approach to predict the population of hot
carriers under continuous wave illumination in large nanoparticles. For this,
we solve the equation of motion of the density matrix taking into account both
excitation of hot carriers as well as subsequent relaxation effects. We present
results for spherical Au and Ag nanoparticles with up to $250,000$ atoms. We
find that the population of highly energetic carriers depends both on the
material and the nanoparticle size. We also study the increase in the
electronic temperature upon illumination and find that Ag nanoparticles exhibit
a much larger temperature increase than Au nanoparticles. Finally, we
investigate the effect of using different models for the relaxation matrix but
find that qualitative features of the hot-carrier population are robust.

<h3>Free energy conservation in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and  homogeneous melt nucleation</h3>

The Z method is a popular atomistic simulation method for determining the
melting temperature of solids by using a sequence of molecular dynamics(MD)
runs in the microcanonical(NVE) ensemble to target the lowest system energy
where the solid always melts. Homogeneous melting at the superheating critical
limit($T_h$), is accompanied by a temperature drop to the equilibrium melting
temperature($T_m$). Implementation of the Z method interfaced with modern {\it
ab initio} electronic structure packages use Hellman-Faynman dynamics to
propagate the ions in the NVE ensemble with the Mermin free energy plus the
ionic kinetic energy conserved. So the electronic temperature($T_{el}$) is kept
fixed along the trajectory which may introduce some spurious ion-electron
interactions in MD runs with large temperature changes. We estimate possible
systematic errors in evaluating melting temperature with different choices of
$T_{el}$. MD runs with the $T_{el}$ = $T_h$ and $T_{el}$ = $T_m$ shows that the
difference in melting temperature can be 200-300 K (3-5\% of the melting
temperature) for our two test systems. Our results are in good agreement with
previous studies with different methods, suggesting the CaSiO$_3$ and SiO$_2$
melts at around 6500 at 100 GPa and 6000 K at 160 GPa. The melting temperature
decreases with increasing $T_{el}$ due to the increasing entropic stabilisation
of the liquid and the system melts about 3 times faster with $T_{el} = T_h$
than with $T_{el} = T_m$. A careful choice of $T_{el}$ in BOMD is essential for
the critical evaluation of the Z method especially at very high temperatures.
Inspection of the homogeneous melting process shows that melting occurs via a
two-step mechanism: 1) melting of the anion sublattice is accompanied by a
small drop in temperature and 2) the formation of small defects which trigger
the formation of small liquid clusters and fully melted.

<h3>Blocking particle dynamics in diamond chain with spatially increasing  flux</h3>

Spatial non-uniformity in tight-binding models serves as a source of rich
phenomena. In this paper, we study a diamond-chain tight-binding model with a
spatially-modulated magnetic flux at each plaquette. In the numerical studies
with various combinations of the minimum and maximum flux values, we find the
characteristic dynamics of a particle, namely, a particle slows down when
approaching the plaquette with $\pi$-flux. This originates from the fact that
the sharply localized eigenstates exist around the $\pi$-flux plaquette. These
localized modes can be understood from a squared model of the original one.
This characteristic blocked dynamics will be observed in photonic waveguides or
cold atoms.

Electronic structure calculations based on Density Functional Theory have
successfully predicted numerous ground state properties of a variety of
molecules and materials. However, exchange and correlation functionals
currently used in the literature, including semi-local and hybrid functionals,
are often inaccurate to describe the electronic properties of heterogeneous
solids, especially systems composed of building blocks with large dielectric
mismatch. Here, we present a dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid
functional, SE-RSH, for the investigation of heterogeneous materials. We define
a spatially dependent fraction of exact exchange inspired by the static
Coulomb-hole and screened-exchange (COHSEX) approximation used in many body
perturbation theory, and we show that the proposed functional accurately
predicts the electronic structure of several non-metallic interfaces, three-
and two-dimensional, pristine and defective solids and nanoparticles.

We calculate the perpendicular electrical conductivity in twisted
three-dimensional graphite (rotationally-stacked graphite pieces) by using the
effective continuum model and the recursive Green's function method. In the low
twist angle regime $(\theta \lesssim 2^\circ)$, the conductivity shows a
non-monotonous dependence with a peak and dip structure as a function of the
twist angle. By analyzing the momentum-resolved conductance and the local
density of states, this behavior is attributed to the Fano resonance between
continuum states of bulk graphite and interface-localized states, which is a
remnant of the flat band in the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We also
apply the formulation to the high-angle regime near the commensurate angle
$\theta \approx 21.8^\circ$, and reproduce the conductance peak observed in the
experiment.

<h3>Delocalized polaron and Burstein-Moss shift induced by Li in  $α$-$\textrm{V}_{2}\textrm{O}_{5}$: DFT+DMFT study</h3>

We performed density functional theory (DFT)+$U$ and dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) calculations with continuous time quantum Monte Carlo impurity
solver to investigate the electronic properties of V$_2$O$_5$ and
Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ ($x$ = 0.125 and 0.25). Pristine V$_2$O$_5$ is a
charge-transfer insulator with strong O $p$-V $d$ hybridization, and exhibits a
large band gap ($E_{\textrm{gap}}$) as well as non-zero conduction band (CB)
gap. We show that the band gap, the number of $d$ electrons of vanadium, $N_d$,
and conduction band (CB) gap for V$_2$O$_5$ obtained from our DMFT calculations
are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. While the DFT+$U$
approach replicates the experimental band gap, it overestimates the value of
$N_d$ and underestimates the CB gap. In the presence of low Li doping, the
electronic properties of V$_2$O$_5$ are mainly driven by a polaronic mechanism,
the electron spin resonance and electron nuclear double resonance
spectroscopies observed the coexistence of free and bound polarons. Notably,
our DMFT results identify both polaron types, with the bound polaron being
energetically preferred, while DFT+$U$ method predicts only the free polaron.
Our DMFT analysis also reveals that increased Li doping leads to electron
filling in the conduction band, shifting the Fermi level, this result
consistent with the observed Burstein-Moss shift upon enhanced Li doping and we
thus demonstrate that the DFT+DMFT approach can be used for accurate and
realistic description of strongly correlated materials.

<h3>Superradiant Transition to a Fermionic Quasicrystal in a Cavity</h3>

Recently, the steady state superradiance in degenerate Fermi gases has been
realized in a cavity, following the previous discovery of the Dicke transition
in Bose gases. The most prominent signature of fermionic Dicke transition is
its density dependence, which is manifested as the Fermi surface nesting effect
and the Pauli blocking effect. We study the superradiant transition in
one-dimensional Fermi gases in a cavity with the presence of an incommensurate
dipolar lattice. We find a first-order Dicke transition induced by indirect
resonance effect, which is a resonance between two atomic levels by the level
repulsion from a third level, and causes extra gap opening. By formulating a
phenomenological theory, we find that the critical pumping strength for this
first-order Dicke transition shows a linear V-shape kink near a particular
indirect resonance modified filling $\nu_{\rm IRM}$. The presence and the
unique density dependence of this transition manifest the fermionic nature and
verify the mechanism of the quasicrystal superradiant transition.

Recently, robustness of superconductivity (transition temperature, Tc) under
high pressures has been observed in high-entropy alloy (HEA), bcc-type
Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta, and HEA-type compounds (Ag,In,Sn,Pb,Bi)Te with a NaCl-type
structure. Since those materials have three-dimensional crystal structure,
investigation on the pressure dependence of Tc of low-dimensional materials is
needed to understand the phenomena. Here, we investigated the superconducting
properties and the crystal structure of BiS2-based layered system
REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Although the robustness of Tc was induced in MTe with
increasing M-site configurational entropy, the increase in RE-site
configurational entropy does not induce robustness of Tc under high pressures
in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The crystal structure of HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 was
confirmed as monoclinic P21/m, which is the same space group as the
zero-entropy counterpart LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The results suggest that an increase
in configurational entropy at blocking layers do not affect crystal structure
and superconducting properties under high pressures in the BiS2-based layered
system.

Electronic properties of spin polarized antiferromagnetic ACrO3 (A = La, Y)
are explored with Hubbard Model using Density Functional Theory (DFT). These
two isostructural systems are investigated using the different Hubbard energy
and analyzed the hybridization of chromium 3d orbitals and oxygen 2p orbitals
and the change in energy band gaps against the Hubbard energy. The bond length
and bond angle affect significantly the orbital contributions of Cr-3d and O-2p
electrons for both the system. We noticed that the Cr-O hybridization affects
the orbital degeneracy and is substantiated with partial density of states.
These results emphasize the contribution of Hubbard energy in correlated
electron systems.

Many systems, when initially placed far from equilibrium, exhibit surprising
behavior in their attempt to equilibrate. Striking examples are the Mpemba
effect and the cooling-heating asymmetry. These anomalous behaviors can be
exploited to shorten the time needed to cool down (or heat up) a system.
Though, a strategy to design these effects in mesoscopic systems is missing. We
bring forward a description that allows us to formulate such strategies, and,
along the way, makes natural these paradoxical behaviors. This is exemplified
with the one-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field.

Supramolecular chemistry protocols applied on surfaces offer compelling
avenues for atomic scale control over organic-inorganic interface structures.
In this approach, adsorbate-surface interactions and two-dimensional
confinement can lead to morphologies and properties that differ dramatically
from those achieved via conventional synthetic approaches. Here, we describe
the bottom-up, on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional coordination
nanostructures based on an iron (Fe)-terpyridine (tpy) interaction borrowed
from functional metal-organic complexes used in photovoltaic and catalytic
applications. Thermally activated diffusion of sequentially deposited ligands
and metal atoms, and intra-ligand conformational changes, lead to Fe-tpy
coordination and formation of these nanochains. Low-temperature Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy and Density Functional Theory were used to elucidate the
atomic-scale morphology of the system, providing evidence of a linear tri-Fe
linkage between facing, coplanar tpy groups. Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy
reveals highest occupied orbitals with dominant contributions from states
located at the Fe node, and ligand states that mostly contribute to the lowest
unoccupied orbitals. This electronic structure yields potential for hosting
photo-induced metal-to-ligand charge transfer in the visible/near-infrared. The
formation of this unusual tpy/tri-Fe/tpy coordination motif has not been
observed for wet chemistry synthesis methods, and is mediated by the bottom-up
on-surface approach used here.

<h3>Parallel Learning by Multitasking Neural Networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Elena Agliari, Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</i>
<br>
<br>
A modern challenge of Artificial Intelligence is learning multiple patterns
at once (i.e.parallel learning). While this can not be accomplished by standard
Hebbian associative neural networks, in this paper we show how the Multitasking
Hebbian Network (a variation on theme of the Hopfield model working on sparse
data-sets) is naturally able to perform this complex task. We focus on systems
processing in parallel a finite (up to logarithmic growth in the size of the
network) amount of patterns, mirroring the low-storage level of standard
associative neural networks at work with pattern recognition. For mild dilution
in the patterns, the network handles them hierarchically, distributing the
amplitudes of their signals as power-laws w.r.t. their information content
(hierarchical regime), while, for strong dilution, all the signals pertaining
to all the patterns are raised with the same strength (parallel regime).
Further, confined to the low-storage setting (i.e., far from the spin glass
limit), the presence of a teacher neither alters the multitasking performances
nor changes the thresholds for learning: the latter are the same whatever the
training protocol is supervised or unsupervised. Results obtained through
statistical mechanics, signal-to-noise technique and Monte Carlo simulations
are overall in perfect agreement and carry interesting insights on multiple
learning at once: for instance, whenever the cost-function of the model is
minimized in parallel on several patterns (in its description via Statistical
Mechanics), the same happens to the standard sum-squared error Loss function
(typically used in Machine Learning).

Based on a positive semidefinite operator technique, exact ground states are
deduced for the non-integrable conducting polymers possessing pentagon type of
unit cell. The study is done in the presence of many-body spin-orbit
interaction (SOI), local and nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion (NNCR) and
presence of external $E$ electric and $B$ magnetic fields, such that the
effects of $B$ on both orbital and spin degrees of freedom is considered. The
SOI, NNCR, and presented external field configurations presence in exact
conducting polymer ground states is a novelty, so the development of the
technique for the treatment possibility of such strongly correlated cases is
presented in details. The deduced ground states show a broad spectrum of
physical characteristics ranging from charge density waves, metal-insulator
transitions, to interesting external field driven effects as e.g. modification
possibility of a static charge distribution by a static external magnetic
field.

We carry out a theoretical investigation of the low-temperature phase diagram
of muonium hydride in two dimensions, using numerical simulations. It is shown
that the phase diagram of this substance is qualitatively different in two and
three dimensions. Specifically, while in three dimensions it has been shown to
be essentially identical to that of parahydrogen, i.e., only displaying a
single (crystalline) phase, in two dimensions it is very similar to that of
He-4, with an equilibrium liquid phase that turns superfluid at a temperature
as high as ~ 2.2 K, and that crystallizes under applied pressure. To our
knowledge, this is the first well-described case of a condensed matter system
whose phase diagram is drastically altered by dimensional reduction.

Donor spins in silicon-28 ($^{28}$Si) are among the most performant qubits in
the solid state, offering record coherence times and gate fidelities above 99%.
Donor spin qubits can be fabricated using the semiconductor-industry compatible
method of deterministic ion implantation. Here we show that the precision of
this fabrication method can be boosted by implanting molecule ions instead of
single atoms. The bystander ions, co-implanted with the dopant of interest,
carry additional kinetic energy and thus increase the detection confidence of
deterministic donor implantation employing single ion detectors to signal the
induced electron-hole pairs. This allows the placement uncertainty of donor
qubits to be minimised without compromising on detection confidence. We
investigate the suitability of phosphorus difluoride (PF$_2^+$) molecule ions
to produce high quality P donor qubits. Since $^{19}$F nuclei have a spin of $I
= 1/2$, it is imperative to ensure that they do not hyperfine couple to P donor
electrons as they would cause decoherence by adding magnetic noise. Using
secondary ion mass spectrometry, we confirm that F diffuses away from the
active region of qubit devices while the P donors remain close to their
original location during a donor activation anneal. PF$_2$-implanted qubit
devices were then fabricated and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements
were performed on the P donor electron. A pure dephasing time of $T_2^* = 20.5
\pm 0.5$ $\mu$s and a coherence time of $T_2^{Hahn} = 424 \pm 5$ $\mu$s were
extracted for the P donor electron-values comparable to those found in previous
P-implanted qubit devices. Closer investigation of the P donor ESR spectrum
revealed that no $^{19}$F nuclear spins were found in the vicinity of the P
donor. Molecule ions therefore show great promise for producing high-precision
deterministically-implanted arrays of long-lived donor spin qubits.

One of the most exciting applications of AI is automated scientific discovery
based on previously amassed data, coupled with restrictions provided by the
known physical principles, including symmetries and conservation laws. Such
automated hypothesis creation and verification can assist scientists in
studying complex phenomena, where traditional physical intuition may fail. Of
particular importance are complex dynamic systems where their time evolution is
strongly influenced by varying external parameters. In this paper we develop a
platform based on a generalised Onsager principle to learn macroscopic
dynamical descriptions of arbitrary stochastic dissipative systems directly
from observations of their microscopic trajectories. We focus on systems whose
complexity and sheer sizes render complete microscopic description impractical,
and constructing theoretical macroscopic models requires extensive domain
knowledge or trial-and-error. Our machine learning approach addresses this by
simultaneously constructing reduced thermodynamic coordinates and interpreting
the dynamics on these coordinates. We demonstrate our method by studying
theoretically and validating experimentally, the stretching of long polymer
chains in an externally applied field. Specifically, we learn three
interpretable thermodynamic coordinates and build a dynamical landscape of
polymer stretching, including (1) the identification of stable and transition
states and (2) the control of the stretching rate. We further demonstrate the
universality of our approach by applying it to an unrelated problem in a
different domain: constructing macroscopic dynamics for spatial epidemics,
showing that our method addresses wide scientific and technological
applications.

Broken time-reversal symmetry in the absence of spin order indicates the
presence of unusual phases such as orbital magnetism and loop currents. The
recently discovered family of kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb,
or Cs), hosting an exotic charge-density wave (CDW) state, has emerged as a
strong candidate for this phase. While initial experiments suggested that the
CDW phase breaks time-reversal symmetry, this idea is being intensely debated
due to conflicting experimental data. In this work we use laser-coupled
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. STM data shows that
the Fourier intensities of all three CDW peaks are different, implying that the
CDW breaks rotational and mirror symmetries. By applying linearly polarized
light along high-symmetry directions, we show that the relative intensities of
the CDW peaks can be reversibly switched, implying a substantial
electro-striction response, indicative of strong non-linear electron-phonon
coupling. A similar CDW intensity switching is observed with perpendicular
magnetic fields, which implies an unusual piezo-magnetic response that, in
turn, requires time-reversal symmetry-breaking. We show that the simplest CDW
that satisfies these constraints and reconciles previous seemingly
contradictory experimental data is an out-of-phase combination of bond charge
order and loop currents that we dub congruent CDW flux phase. Our laser-STM
data opens the door to the possibility of dynamic optical control of complex
quantum phenomenon in correlated materials.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) are considered
highly promising platforms for next-generation optoelectronic devices. Owing to
its atomically thin structure, device performance is strongly impacted by a
minute amount of defects. Although defects are usually considered to be
disturbing, defect engineering has become an important strategy to control and
design new properties of 2D materials. Here, we produce single S vacancies in a
monolayer of MoS$_2$ on Au(111). Using a combination of scanning tunneling and
atomic force microscopy, we show that these defects are negatively charged and
give rise to a Kondo resonance, revealing the presence of an unpaired electron
spin exchange coupled to the metal substrate. The strength of the exchange
coupling depends on the density of states at the Fermi level, which is
modulated by the moir\'e structure of the MoS$_2$ lattice and the Au(111)
substrate. In the absence of direct hybridization of MoS$_2$ with the metal
substrate, the S vacancy remains charge-neutral. Our results suggest that
defect engineering may be used to induce and tune magnetic properties of
otherwise non-magnetic materials.

Cold atomic gases provide a remarkable testbed to study the physics of
interacting many-body quantum systems. They have started to play a major role
as quantum simulators, given the high degree of control that is possible. A
crucial element is given by the necessarily non-zero temperature. However
cooling to the required ultralow temperatures or even simply measuring the
temperature directly on the system can prove to be very challenging tasks.
Here, we implement thermometry on strongly interacting two- and one-dimensional
Bose gases with high sensitivity in the nano-Kelvin temperature range. Our
method is aided by the fact that the decay of the first-order correlation
function is very sensitive to the temperature when interactions are strong. We
find that there may be a significant temperature variation when the
three-dimensional quantum gas is cut into two-dimensional slices or into
one-dimensional tubes. Strikingly, the temperature for the one-dimensional case
can be much lower than the initial temperature. Our findings show that this
decrease results from the interplay of dimensional reduction and strong
interactions.

In the work, we investigated a generalized model of the fermionic lattice gas
in the form of the extended Hubbard model with intersite Ising-like
interactions (both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic) at the atomic limit on
the triangular lattice. In the ground state, we find the exact phase diagram as
a function of $\mu$. Within the mean-field decoupling of the intersite term and
exact treatment of onsite interaction, we found also the diagrams for $T\geq 0$
including metastable phases. For antiferromagnetic coupling, we find that
nontrival ordered phase can exist with coexistence of charge and metamagnetic
ordering. The transition between the ordered phase and the nonordered phase can
be discontinuous as well continuous depending on the model parameters.
Moreover, the ordered phase can coexist with the nonordered phase in phase
separated states for fixed electron concentration. Additionally, the ranges of
phases metastability are determined in the neighborhood of the discontinuous
transitions.

We investigate the statistics of the fluctuations of the energy transfer
between an overdamped Brownian particle, whose motion is confined by a
stationary harmonic potential, and a surrounding viscoelastic fluid at constant
temperature. We derive an analytical expression for the probability density
function of the energy exchanged with the fluid over a finite time interval,
which implicitly involves the friction memory kernel that encodes the coupling
with such a non-Markovian environment, and reduces to the well known expression
for the heat distribution in a viscous fluid. We show that, while the odd
moments of this distribution are zero, the even moments can be explicitly
expressed in terms of the auto-correlation function of the particle position,
which generally exhibits a non-mono-exponential decay when the fluid bath is
viscoelastic. Our results are verified by experimental measurements for an
optically-trapped colloidal bead in semidilute micellar and polymer solutions,
finding and excellent agreement for all time intervals over which the energy
exchange takes place.

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with bcc(001)-type structures such as
Fe(001)/MgO(001)/Fe(001), have been widely used as the core of various
spintronic devices such as magnetoresistive memories; however, the limited
material selection of (001)-type MTJs hinders the further development of
spintronic devices. Here, as an alternative to the (001)-type MTJs, an
fcc(111)-type MTJ using a fully epitaxial CoFe/rock-salt MgAlO (MAO)/CoFe is
explored to introduce close-packed lattice systems into MTJs. Using an
atomically flat Ru(0001) epitaxial buffer layer, fcc(111) epitaxial growth of
the CoFe/MAO/CoFe trilayer is achieved. Sharp CoFe(111)/MAO(111) interfaces are
confirmed due to the introduction of periodic dislocations by forming a 5:6
in-plane lattice matching structure. The fabricated (111) MTJ exhibits a tunnel
magnetoresistance ratio of 37% at room temperature (47% at 10 K). Symmetric
differential conductance curves with respect to bias polarity are observed,
indicating the achievement of nearly identical upper and lower MAO interface
qualities. Despite the charge-uncompensated (111) orientation for a
rock-salt-like MAO barrier, the achievement of flat, stable, and spin-polarized
barrier interfaces opens a promising avenue for expanding the design of MTJ
structures.

Achieving highly transmitting molecular junctions through resonant transport
at low bias is key to the next-generation low-power molecular devices.
Although, resonant transport in molecular junctions was observed by connecting
a molecule between the metal electrodes via chemical anchors by applying a high
source-drain bias (> 1V), the conductance was limited to < 0.1 G$_0$, G$_0$
being the quantum of conductance. Here, we report electronic transport
measurements by directly connecting a Ferrocene molecule between Au electrodes
at the ambient condition in a mechanically controllable break junction setup
(MCBJ), revealing a conductance peak at ~ 0.2 G$_0$ in the conductance
histogram. A similar experiment was repeated for Ferrocene terminated with
amine (-NH2) and cyano (-CN) anchors, where conductance histograms exhibit an
extended low conductance feature including the sharp high conductance peak,
similar to pristine ferrocene. Statistical analysis of the data along with
density functional theory-based transport calculation suggests the possible
molecular conformation with a strong hybridization between the Au electrodes
and Fe atom of Ferrocene molecule is responsible for a near-perfect
transmission in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, leading to the resonant
transport at a small applied bias (< 0.5V). Moreover, calculations including
Van der Waals/dispersion corrections reveal a covalent like organometallic
bonding between Au and the central Fe atom of Ferrocene, having bond energies
of ~ 660 meV. Overall, our study not only demonstrates the realization of an
air-stable highly transmitting molecular junction, but also provides an
important insight about the nature of chemical bonding at the
metal/organo-metallic interface.

Using Brownian vibrators, we conducted a study on the structures and dynamics
of quasi-2d granular materials with packing fractions ($\phi$) ranging from
0.111 to 0.832. Our observations revealed a remarkable large-scale collective
motion in hard granular disk systems, encompassing four distinct phases:
granular fluid, collective fluid, poly-crystal, and crystal. The collective
motion emerge at $\phi=$0.317, coinciding with a peak in local density
fluctuations. However, this collective motion ceased to exist at $\phi=$0.713
when the system transitioned into a crystalline state. While the poly-crystal
and crystal phases exhibited similarities to equilibrium hard disks, the first
two phases differed significantly from the equilibrium systems and previous
experiments involving uniformly driven spheres. This disparity suggests that
the collective motion arises from a competition controlled by volume fraction.
Specifically, it involves an active force and an effective attractive
interaction resulting from inelastic particle collisions. Remarkably, these
findings align with recent theoretical research on the flocking motion of
spherical active particles without alignment mechanisms.

<br>
<br>
Nonlocal spin polarization phenomena are thoroughly investigated in the
devices made of chiral metallic single crystals of CrNb$_3$S$_6$ and NbSi$_2$
as well as of polycrystalline NbSi$_2$. We demonstrate that simultaneous
injection of charge currents in the opposite ends of the device with the
nonlocal setup induces the switching behavior of spin polarization in a
controllable manner. Such a nonlocal spin polarization appears regardless of
the difference in the materials and device dimensions, implying that the
current injection in the nonlocal configuration splits spin-dependent chemical
potentials throughout the chiral crystal even though the current is injected
into only a part of the crystal. We show that the proposed model of the spin
dependent chemical potentials explains the experimental data successfully. The
nonlocal double-injection device may offer significant potential to control the
spin polarization to large areas because of the nature of long-range nonlocal
spin polarization in chiral materials.

<h3>Interplay of the complete-graph and Gaussian fixed-point asymptotics in  finite-size scaling of percolation above the upper critical dimension</h3>

<br>
<br>
Percolation has two mean-field theories, the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) and
the Landau mean-field theory or the complete graph (CG) asymptotics. By
large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically study the interplay of
the GFP and CG effects to the finite-size scaling of percolation above the
upper critical dimension $d_c = 6$ with periodic, free, and cylindrical
boundary conditions. Our results suggest that, with periodic boundaries, the
\emph{unwrapped} correlation length scales as $L^{d/6}$ at the critical point,
diverging faster than $L$ above $d_c$. As a consequence, the scaling behaviours
of macroscopic quantities with respect to the linear system size $L$ follow the
CG asymptotics. The distance-dependent properties, such as the short-distance
behaviour of the two-point correlation function and the Fourier transformed
quantities with non-zero modes, are still controlled by the GFP. With free
boundaries, since the correlation length is cutoff by $L$, the finite-size
scaling at the critical point is controlled by the GFP. However, some
quantities are observed to exhibit the CG aysmptotics at the low-temperature
pseudo-critical point, such as the sizes of the two largest clusters. With
cylindrical boundaries, due to the interplay of the GFP and CG effects, the
correlation length along the axial direction of the cylinder scales as $\xi_L
\sim L^{(d-1)/5}$ within the critical window of size $O(L^{-2(d-1)/5})$,
distinct from both periodic and free boundaries. A field-theoretical
calculation for deriving the scaling of $\xi_L$ is also presented. Moreover,
the one-point surface correlation function along the axial direction of the
cylinder is observed to scale as ${\tau}^{(1-d)/2}$ for short distance but then
enter a plateau of order $L^{-3(d-1)/5}$ before it decays significantly fast.

Glasses and gels, widely encountered amorphous solids with diverse industrial
and everyday applications, share intriguing similarities such as rigidity
without crystalline order and dynamic slowing down during aging. However, the
underlying differences between these two fascinating materials have remained
elusive. Here we uncover distinct elastic properties concerning observation and
aging times in glasses and gels, while delving into the underlying mechanisms.
In glasses, we observe a gradual decrease in the shear modulus, while the bulk
modulus remains constant throughout the observation time. In contrast, gels
exhibit a decrease in both the shear and bulk moduli over the observation time.
Additionally, during aging, glasses exhibit a steady trend of stiffening, while
gels demonstrate initial stiffening followed by softening. By unravelling the
intricate relationship between structure, dynamics, and elasticity, we
attribute these differences to mechanisms that minimize free energy: structural
ordering in glasses and interface reduction in gels. Our work not only uncovers
the distinct behaviors of glasses and gels but also sheds light on the origin
and evolution of elasticity in non-equilibrium disordered solids, offering
significant implications for the application and design of amorphous materials.

<h3>Shock-driven nucleation and self-organization of dislocations in the  dynamical Peierls model</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Dynamic nucleation of dislocations caused by a stress front ('shock') of
amplitude $\sigma_{\rm a}$ moving with speed $V$ is investigated by solving
numerically the Dynamic Peierls Equation with an efficient method. Speed $V$
and amplitude $\sigma_{\rm a}$ are considered as independent variables, with
$V$ possibly exceeding the longitudinal wavespeed $c_{\rm L}$. Various
reactions between dislocations take place such as scattering, dislocation-pair
nucleation, annihilation, and crossing. Pairs of edge dislocation are always
nucleated with speed $v\gtrsim c_{\rm L}$ (and likewise for screws with $c_{\rm
L}$ replaced by $c_{\rm S}$, the shear wavespeed). The plastic wave exhibits
self-organization, forming distinct `bulk' and `front' zones. Nucleations occur
either within the bulk or at the zone interface, depending on the value of $V$.
The front zone accumulates dislocations that are expelled from the bulk or from
the interface. In each zone, dislocation speeds and densities are measured as
functions of simulation parameters. The densities exhibit a scaling behavior
with stress, given by $((\sigma_a/\sigma_{\rm th})^2-1)^\beta$, where
$\sigma_{\rm th}$ represents the nucleation threshold and $0<\beta<1$.

Generalizing response theory of open systems far from equilibrium is a
central quest of nonequilibrium statistical physics. Using stochastic
thermodynamics, we develop an algebraic method to study the response of
nonequilibrium steady state to arbitrary perturbations. This allows us to
derive explicit expressions for the response of edge currents as well as
traffic to perturbations in kinetic barriers and driving forces. We also show
that these responses satisfy very simple bounds. For the response to energy
perturbations, we straightforwardly recover results obtained using nontrivial
graph-theoretical methods.

Ferrimagnets have received renewed attention as a promising platform for
spintronic applications. Of particular interest is the Mn4N from the
${\epsilon}$-phase of the manganese nitride as an emergent rare-earth-free
spintronic material due to its perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, small
saturation magnetization, high thermal stability, and large domain wall
velocity. We have achieved high-quality (001)-ordered Mn$_{4}$N thin film by
sputtering Mn onto ${\eta}$-phase Mn$_{3}$N$_{2}$ seed layers on Si substrates.
As the deposited Mn thickness varies, nitrogen ion migration across the
Mn$_{3}$N$_{2}$/Mn layers leads to a continuous evolution of the layers to
Mn$_{3}$N$_{2}$/Mn$_{2}$N/Mn$_{4}$N, Mn$_{2}$N/Mn$_{4}$N, and eventually
Mn$_{4}$N alone. The ferrimagnetic Mn$_{4}$N indeed exhibits perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy, and forms via a nucleation-and-growth mechanism. The
nitrogen ion migration is also manifested in a significant exchange bias, up to
0.3 T at 5 K, due to the interactions between ferrimagnetic Mn$_{4}$N and
antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$N$_{2}$ and Mn$_{2}$N. These results demonstrate a
promising all-nitride magneto-ionic platform with remarkable tunability for
device applications.

<br>
<br>
Ni is the second most abundant element in the Earth's core. Yet, its effects
on the inner core's structure and formation process are usually disregarded
because of its similar atomic numbers with Fe. Using ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations, we find that the bcc phase can spontaneously crystallize
in liquid Ni at temperatures above Fe's melting point at inner core pressures.
The melting temperature of Ni is shown to be 700-800 K higher than that of Fe
at 323-360 GPa. Phase relations among hcp, bcc, and liquid differ between Fe
and Ni. Ni can be a bcc stabilizer for Fe at high temperatures and inner core
pressures. A small amount of Ni can accelerate Fe's crystallization under core
pressure. These results suggest Ni may substantially impact the structure and
formation process of the solid inner core.

We present results of the first investigations on the correlated nature of
electronic states that cross the Fermi level in Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O aka LK-99
obtained within the DFT + DMFT approach. Coulomb correlations between Cu-$d$
electrons led to the opening of the band gap between the extra-O $p$ and Cu
$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ states. We state that oxygen $p$ states play a significant role
in the electronic properties of LK-99. We also assume that doping with
electrons is necessary to turn the stoichiometric Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O into
conducting state.

Infrared and Raman spectroscopies are ubiquitous techniques employed in many
experimental laboratories, thanks to their fast and non-destructive nature able
to capture materials' features as spectroscopic fingerprints. Nevertheless,
these measurements frequently need theoretical support in order to
unambiguously decipher and assign complex spectra. Linear-response theory
provides an effective way to obtain the higher-order derivatives needed, but
its applicability to modern exchange-correlation functionals remains limited.
Here, we devise an automated, open-source, user-friendly approach based on
ground-state density-functional theory and the electric enthalpy functional to
allow seamless calculations of first-principles infrared and Raman spectra. By
employing a finite-displacement and finite-field approach, we allow for the use
of any functional, as well as an efficient treatment of large low-symmetry
structures. Additionally, we propose a simple scheme for efficiently sampling
the Brillouin zone with different electric fields. To demonstrate the
capabilities of our approach, we provide illustrations using the ferroelectric
LiNbO$_3$ crystal as a paradigmatic example. We predict infrared and Raman
spectra using various (semi)local, Hubbard corrected, and hybrid functionals.
Our results also show how PBE0 and extended Hubbard functionals yield in this
case the best match in term of peak positions and intensities, respectively.

<br>
Multiferroic materials have undergone extensive research in the past two
decades in an effort to produce a sizable room-temperature magneto-electric
(ME) effect in either exclusive or composite materials for use in a variety of
electronic or spintronic devices. These studies have looked into the ME effect
by switching the electric polarization by the magnetic field or switching the
magnetism by the electric field. Here, an innovative way is developed to knot
the functional properties based on the tremendous modulation of electronics and
magnetization by the electric field of the topotactic phase transitions (TPT)
in heterostructures composed of metallic-magnet/TPT-material. It is divulged
that application of a nominal potential difference of 2-3 Volts induces
gigantic changes in magnetization by 100-250% leading to colossal Voltomagnetic
effect, which would be tremendously beneficial for low-power consumption
applications in spintronics. Switching electronics and magnetism by inducing
TPT through applying an electric field requires much less energy, making such
TPT-based systems promising for energy-efficient memory and logic applications
as well as opening a plethora of tremendous opportunities for applications in
different domains.

<h3>Unraveling the unusually high electrical conductivity of the delafossite  metal PdCoO$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The prototypical delafossite metal PdCoO$_2$ has been the subject of intense
interest for hosting exotic transport properties. Using first-principles
transport calculations and theoretical modeling, we reveal that the high
electrical conductivity of PdCoO$_2$ at room temperature originates from the
contributions of both high Fermi velocities, enabled by Pd $4d_{z^2}-5s$
hybridization, and exceptionally weak electron-phonon coupling, which leads to
a coupling strength ($\lambda=0.057$) that is nearly an order of magnitude
smaller than those of common metals. The abnormally weak electron-phonon
coupling in PdCoO$_2$ results from a low electronic density of states at the
Fermi level, as well as the large and strongly facetted Fermi surface with
suppressed Umklapp electron-phonon matrix elements. We anticipate that our work
will inform the design of unconventional metals with superior transport
properties.

The recent report of superconductivity in the Cu-doped PbPO compound
stimulates the extensive researches on its physical properties. Herein, the
detailed atomic and electronic structures of this compound are investigated,
which are the necessary information to explain the physical properties,
including possible superconductivity. By the first-principles electronic
structure calculations, we find that the partial replacement of Pb at $4f$ site
by Cu atom, instead of Pb at $6h$ site, plays a crucial role in dominating the
electronic state at Fermi energy. The $3d$ electronic orbitals of Cu atom
emerge near the Fermi energy and exhibit strong spin-polarization, resulting in
the local moment around the doped Cu atom. Particularly, the ground state of
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O (x = 1) is determined to be a semiconducting
phase, in good agreement with the experimental measurements.

<h3>Chirality-induced spin splitting in 1D InSeI</h3>

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in chiral materials can induce chirality-dependent
spin splitting, enabling electrical manipulation of spin polarization. Here, we
use first-principles calculations to investigate the electronic states of
chiral one-dimensional (1D) InSeI, which has two enantiomorphic configurations
with left- and right-handedness. We find that opposite spin states exist in the
left- and right-handed 1D InSeI with significant spin splitting. Although the
spin states at the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM)
are both degenerate, a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition occurs when a
moderate tensile strain ($\sim$4%) is applied along the 1D chain direction,
leading to chirality-dependent and collinear spin-momentum locking at the CBM.
These findings indicate that 1D InSeI is a promising material for chiral
spintronics.

Lee et al. reported that the compound LK99, with a chemical formula of
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O ($0.9<x<1.1$), exhibits room-temperature
superconductivity under ambient pressure. In this study, we investigated the
transport and magnetic properties of pure Cu$_2$S and LK-99 containing Cu$_2$S.
We observed a sharp superconducting-like transition and a thermal hysteresis
behavior in the resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. However, we did not
observe zero-resistivity below the transition temperature. We argue that the
so-called superconducting behavior in LK-99 is most likely due to a reduction
in resistivity caused by the first order structural phase transition of Cu$_2$S
at around 385 K, from the $\beta$ phase at high temperature to the $\gamma$
phase at low temperature.

<h3>Resonant multiple-phonon-assisted single-photon anti-Stokes  photoluminescence in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted intense scrutiny due to
their unusual interactions with light. They exhibit near-unity
photoluminescence quantum yields, cooperative superfluorescence in colloidal
superlattices, and possibly refrigerate optically when excited below gap. For
the latter, multiple-phonon-assisted energy up-conversion to the band edge is
followed by emission of higher energy, band gap photons. Unexpectedly strong
electron-phonon interactions, however, are needed to explain near-unity
up-conversion efficiencies wherein multiple-phonon absorption rates become
competitive with multiple-phonon-emission mediated non-radiative relaxation.
Here, we resolve this seeming contradiction to rationalize near-unity
anti-Stokes photoluminescence efficiencies ($\eta_{ASPL}$) in CsPbBr3
nanocrystals as the consequence of resonant multiple-phonon absorption by
polarons. The theory self-consistently explains paradoxically large
efficiencies for intrinsically-disfavored, multiple-phonon-assisted anti-Stokes
photoluminescence in nanocrystals. It also explains observed non-Arrhenius
$\eta_{ASPL}$ temperature and energy detuning dependencies. Beyond this, the
developed microscopic mechanism has immediate and important implications for
applications of anti-Stokes photoluminescence towards condensed phase optical
refrigeration, radiation-balanced lasers, and the development of ultra-stable
optical cavities.

<br>
<br>
Cerium is a fascinating element due to its diverse physical properties, which
include forming various crystal structures ($\gamma$, $\alpha$, $\alpha^{'}$,
$\alpha^{''}$ and $\epsilon$), mixed valence behavior and superconductivity,
making it an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between different
electronic states. Here, we present a comprehensive transport study of cerium
under hydrostatic pressures up to 54 GPa. Upon applying pressure, cerium
undergoes the $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $\alpha^{''}$ transition at around 4.9
GPa, which is accompanied by the appearance of superconductivity with $T_{\rm
c}$ of 0.4 K, and $T_{\rm c}$ slightly increases to 0.5 K at 11.4 GPa. At 14.3
GPa, $T_{\rm c}$ suddenly increases when the $\alpha^{''}$ phase transforms
into the $\epsilon$ phase, reaching a maximum value of 1.25 K at around 17.2
GPa. Upon further increasing the pressure, $T_{\rm c}$ monotonically decreases.
Together with the results of previous studies, our findings suggest that the
evolution of superconductivity in cerium is closely correlated with the
multiple pressure-induced structural transitions and corresponding unusual
electronic structures.

Active matter, an ensemble of self-propelled entities, exhibits various
nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this paper, we construct a non-Hermitian
quantum many-body model in one dimension analogous to the Vicsek model, a
prototypical model of active matter, and investigate its quantum phase
transitions. The model consists of two-component hard-core bosons undergoing
ferromagnetic interactions and with activity: spin-dependent asymmetric
hopping. Numerical results show the emergence of a ferromagnetic order induced
by the activity, which is a quantum counterpart of flocking in classical
examples, and it even survives without the ferromagnetic interaction. We find
through perturbation theory and solving the two-particle case that the
non-Hermitian skin effect at the two-particle level is crucial for this
flocking phase. To take this effect into account, we employ a two-site
mean-field theory and qualitatively reproduce the numerically obtained phase
diagram. We further numerically study a variant of our model, where the
hard-core condition is relaxed, and confirm the robustness of the ferromagnetic
order.
