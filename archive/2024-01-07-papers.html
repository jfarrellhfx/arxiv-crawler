<h3>Information limit of 15 pm achieved with bright-field ptychography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02439</a>

<i>Haozhi Sha, Jizhe Cui, Wenfeng Yang, Rong Yu</i>
<p>It is generally assumed that a high spatial resolution of a microscope
requires a large numerical aperture of the imaging lens or detector. In this
study, the information limit of 15 pm is achieved in transmission electron
microscopy using only the bright-field disk (small numerical aperture) via
multislice ptychography. The results indicate that high-frequency information
has been encoded in the electrons scattered to low angles due to the multiple
scattering of electrons in the objects, making it possible to break the
diffraction limit of imaging via bright-field ptychography.

<h3>SPD deformation of pearlitic, bainitic and martensitic steels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02497" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02497</a>
<br>
<i>M. W. Kapp, A. Hohenwarter, A. Bachmaier, T. Mueller, R. Pippan</i>
<p>The deformation behavior of nearly fully pearlitic, bainitic and martensitic
steels during severe plastic deformation is summarized in this paper. Despite
their significantly different yield stresses and their microstructures, their
hardening behavior during SPD is similar. Due to the enormous hardening
capacity the SPD deformation is limited by the strength of the tool materials.
The microstructure at the obtainable limit of strain are quite similar, which
is a nanocrystalline structure in the order of 10 nm, dependent on the
obtainable strain. The nanograins are partially supersaturated with carbon and
the grain boundaries are stabilized by carbon. Another characteristic feature
is the anisotropy in grain shape which results in an anisotropy of strength,
ductility and fracture toughness. The results are important for the development
of ultra-strong materials and essential for this type of steels which are
frequently used for application where the behavior under rolling contact and
sliding contact is important.

<h3>Andreev bound states at nonmagnetic impurities in  superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02512" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02512</a>
<br>
<i>G. A. Bobkov, I.V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov, A. A. Golubov</i>
<p>Andreev bound states can occur at single impurities in superconductors if the
impurities suppress superconductivity for a given system. In particular,
well-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states occur at magnetic impurities in conventional
s-wave superconductors. Here we demonstrate that nonmagnetic impurities in S/AF
heterostructures with conventional intraband s-wave pairing also produce
Andreev bound states. Analogously to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states the
bound states in S/AF bilayers are spin split, but the spin of a particular
bound state is determined by the sublattice to which the impurity belongs. The
standard decay of the bound state LDOS is superimposed by atomic oscillations
related to the staggered character of the exchange field in the host material
and by another oscillating pattern produced by finite-momentum Neel triplet
pairing generated at the impurity.

<h3>Conformal invariance and composite operators: A strategy for improving  the derivative expansion of the nonperturbative renormalization group</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02517" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02517</a>
<br>
<i>Bertrand Delamotte, Gonzalo De Polsi, Matthieu Tissier, Nicolás Wschebor</i>
<p>It is expected that conformal symmetry is an emergent property of many
systems at their critical point. This imposes strong constraints on the
critical behavior of a given system. Taking them into account in theoretical
approaches can lead to a better understanding of the critical physics or
improve approximation schemes. However, within the framework of the
non-perturbative or functional renormalization group and, in particular, of one
of its most used approximation schemes, the Derivative Expansion (DE),
non-trivial constraints only apply from third order (usually denoted
$\mathcal{O}(\partial^4)$), at least in the usual formulation of the DE that
includes correlation functions involving only the order parameter. In this
work, we implement conformal constraints on a generalized DE including
composite operators and show that new constraints already appear at second
order of the DE (or $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$). We show how these constraints
can be used to fix nonphysical regulator parameters.

<h3>Liouvillian recursion method for the electronic Green's function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02527</a>
<br>
<i>Alexandre Foley</i>
<p>In this paper, we present a framework for the recursion method applied within
the Liouvillian formalism, enabling the computation of response functions for a
wide range of quantum operators. Indeed, unlike most previous literature on the
Liouvillian recursion method, this framework readily computes electronic
Green's function. We demonstrate the method by showcasing its application to a
temperature dependence study of a $2\times2$ Hubbard model. Our results show
that the recursion method accurately computes response functions and provides
valuable insights into quantum many-body systems. While the method has already
been successfully applied to study of condensed matter, further efforts are
required to develop efficient algorithms for larger and more realistic systems.
Tensor network methods and other variational techniques hold promise for
tackling these challenges. Overall, the recursion method offers a flexible
approach for investigating strongly correlated system.

<h3>Stiffer alginate gels deposit more efficiently in microchannel flows</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02530" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02530</a>
<br>
<i>Barrett T Smith, Sara M Hashmi</i>
<p>The behavior of crosslinking polymer solutions as they transition from
liquid-like to solid-like material in flow determines success or failure in
several applications, from 3D printing to oil recovery in the earth's
subsurface to a wide variety of biological flows. Dilute polymer solutions flow
easily, while concentrated polymers or crosslinked polymer gels can clog pores,
nozzles, or channels. We have recently uncovered and described a third regime
of flow dynamics in polymers that occurs when crosslinking happens during flow:
intermittent flows. In a model system of alginate and calcium meeting at a
Y-shaped junction in a microfluidic channel, a persistent and regular pattern
of intermittent flow occurs when driven at a constant volume flow rate. At the
junction, calcium crosslinks alginate to form an alginate gel, which
subsequently deposits on the channel wall. As gel continues to deposit, it
obstructs the channel, causing the driving pressure to increase to maintain a
constant flow rate. At a critical pressure, corresponding to a critical shear
stress, the fluid pulls the gel from the wall, removing the gel from the device
and resulting in a clear channel. The gel deposit begins again, and the process
then repeats as long as flow continues. Chemical concentrations and flow rate
control both the frequency of ablation and the critical shear stress. In this
work, we provide an analytical framework to quantitatively describe the
intermittent behavior as a result of diffusively driven deposition in a high
Peclet number flow where convection dominates. Fitting the experimental data to
the model allows estimation of the deposition efficiency, or the fraction of
flowing material that sticks to the channel walls. By correlating the results
of the model with bulk rheology measurements, we find that deposition
efficiency increases with the stiffness of the gel formed in flow.

<h3>Emergent transverse-field Ising model in $\boldsymbol{d}^\mathbf{4}$  spin-orbit Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02532</a>
<br>
<i>Jiří Chaloupka</i>
<p>Mott-insulating transition metal oxides containing $t_{2g}^4$ ions with
strong spin-orbit coupling were recently demonstrated to display unusual
magnetism due to a dynamical mixing of the low-energy multiplet states via
exchange processes. Here we derive exchange interactions in the situation where
a tetragonal or trigonal crystal field selects a single relevant excited state
on top of the singlet ionic ground state, producing an effective
spin-$\frac12$. We show that these moments universally obey antiferromagnetic
transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with an intrinsic transverse field
generated by the splitting of the two ionic singlets. Using Ru$^{4+}$ as a
example ion, we provide quantitative estimates of the exchange and illustrate
the emergent TFIM physics based on phase diagrams and excitation spectra
obtained for several 2D lattices - square, honeycomb, as well as for the
frustrated triangular lattice.

<h3>Poly-dispersity and deformation effects on pore throat size in granular  beds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02534</a>
<br>
<i>Dhairya R. Vyas, Song Gao, Paul B. Umbanhowar, Julio M. Ottino, Richard M. Lueptow</i>
<p>Static granular packings play a central role in numerous industrial
applications and natural settings. In these situations, fluid or fine particle
flow through a bed of static particles is heavily influenced by the narrowest
passage connecting the pores of the packing, commonly referred to as pore
throats or constrictions. Existing studies predominantly assume monodisperse
rigid particles, but this is an oversimplification of the problem. In this
work, we illustrate the connection between pore throat size, polydispersity,
and particle deformation. Simple analytical expressions are provided to link
these properties of the packing, followed by examples from Discrete Element
Method (DEM) simulations of fine particle percolation demonstrating the impact
of polydispersity and particle deformation. Our intent is to emphasize the
substantial impact of polydispersity and particle deformation on constriction
size, underscoring the importance of accounting for these effects in particle
transport in granular packings.

<h3>DISO: A Domain Ontology for Modeling Dislocations in Crystalline  Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02540" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02540</a>
<br>
<i>Ahmad Zainul Ihsan, Said Fathalla, Stefan Sandfeld</i>
<p>Crystalline materials, such as metals and semiconductors, nearly always
contain a special defect type called dislocation. This defect decisively
determines many important material properties, e.g., strength, fracture
toughness, or ductility. Over the past years, significant effort has been put
into understanding dislocation behavior across different length scales via
experimental characterization techniques and simulations. This paper introduces
the dislocation ontology (DISO), which defines the concepts and relationships
related to linear defects in crystalline materials. We developed DISO using a
top-down approach in which we start defining the most general concepts in the
dislocation domain and subsequent specialization of them. DISO is published
through a persistent URL following W3C best practices for publishing Linked
Data. Two potential use cases for DISO are presented to illustrate its
usefulness in the dislocation dynamics domain. The evaluation of the ontology
is performed in two directions, evaluating the success of the ontology in
modeling a real-world domain and the richness of the ontology.

<h3>On topological order in higher composites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02551</a>
<br>
<i>Egor Babaev</i>
<p>The recent experiments reported observation of a state with symmetry-breaking
appearing at the level of four-electron order parameter (electronic quadruplets
condensation) in a multicomponent system. This is in contrast to the
conventional case where order appears at the level of electron pairing fields.
Related states were theoretically demonstrated in mixtures of ultracold atoms.
Here, we discuss the topological counterparts of this concept, i.e.,
topological order appearing only in higher-than-usual composites under somewhat
related circumstances in multicomponent systems.

<h3>Bundling by volume exclusion in non-equilibrium spaghetti</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02579" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02579</a>
<br>
<i>I. Bonamassa, B. Ráth, M. Pósfai, M. Abért, D. Keliger, B. Szegedy, J. Kertész, L. Lovász, A.-L. Barabási</i>
<p>In physical networks, like the brain or metamaterials, we often observe local
bundles, corresponding to locally aligned link configurations. Here we
introduce a minimal model for bundle formation, modeling physical networks as
non-equilibrium packings of hard-core 3D elongated links. We show that growth
is logarithmic in time, in stark contrast with the algebraic behavior of lower
dimensional random packing models. Equally important, we find that this slow
kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict an algebraic growth
due to the spontaneous formation of bundles. Our results offer a mechanism for
bundle formation resulting purely from volume exclusion, and provide a
benchmark for bundling activation and growth during the assembly of physical
networks.

<h3>Thermal transport of confined water molecules in quasi-one-dimensional  nanotubes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02595" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02595</a>
<br>
<i>Shun Imamura, Yusei Kobayashi, Eiji Yamamoto</i>
<p>Dimensions and molecular structure play pivotal roles in the principle of
heat conduction. The dimensional characteristics of solution within nanoscale
systems depend on the degrees of confinement. However, the influence of such
variations on heat transfer remains inadequately understood. Here, we perform
quasi-one-dimensional non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to
calculate the thermal conductivity of water molecules confined in carbon
nanotubes. The structure of water molecules is determined depending on the
nanotube radius, forming a single-file, a single-layer, and a double-layer
structure, corresponding to an increasing radius order. We reveal that the
thermal conductivity of liquid water has a sublinear dependency on nanotube
length exclusively when water molecules form a single file. Stronger
confinement leads to behavioral and structural characteristics closely
resembling a one-dimensional nature. Moreover, single-layer-structure water
molecules exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity. We elucidate that this is due
to the minor vibration of water molecules perpendicular to the heat flux
direction and the absence of transitions to another layer that occurs in the
system in which they form a double layer in relatively large radius nanotubes.

<h3>Tracking Surface Charge Dynamics on Single Nanoparticles</h3>

Summers, Aiichiro Nakano, Priya Vashishta, Fuyuki Shimojo, Jian Wu, Cesar Costa Vera, Stefan A. Maier, Emiliano Cortés, Boris Bergues, Matthias F. Kling</i>
<p>Surface charges play a fundamental role in physics and chemistry,
particularly in shaping the catalytic properties of nanomaterials. Tracking
nanoscale surface charge dynamics remains challenging due to the involved
length and time scales. Here, we demonstrate real-time access to the nanoscale
charge dynamics on dielectric nanoparticles employing reaction nanoscopy. We
present a four-dimensional visualization of the non-linear charge dynamics on
strong-field irradiated single SiO$_2$ nanoparticles with femtosecond-nanometer
resolution and reveal how surface charges affect surface molecular bonding with
quantum dynamical simulations. We performed semi-classical simulations to
uncover the roles of diffusion and charge loss in the surface charge
redistribution process. Understanding nanoscale surface charge dynamics and its
influence on chemical bonding on a single nanoparticle level unlocks an
increased ability to address global needs in renewable energy and advanced
healthcare.

<h3>Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Phase Transitions in Potts model and  Interacting Ehrenfest urn model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02632</a>

<i>Chi-Ho Cheng, Pik-Yin Lai</i>
<p>We show that the recently proposed interacting Ehrenfest M-urn model at
equilibrium can be exactly mapped to a mean-field M-state Potts model. By
exploiting this correspondence, we show that the M-state Potts model with M >=
3, with transition rates motivated by the non-equilibrium urn model, can
exhibit rich non-equilibrium spin dynamics such as non-equilibrium steady
states and non-equilibrium periodic states. Monte Carlo simulations of the
3-state Potts model are performed to demonstrate explicitly the first-order
transitions for the equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states, as well as
the far-from-equilibrium periodic states.

<h3>Signatures of room-temperature superconductivity emerging in  two-dimensional domains within the new Bi/Pb-based ceramic cuprate  superconductors at ambient pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02642</a>
<br>
<i>S. Dzhumanov, D.D. Gulamova, Sh.S. Djumanov</i>
<p>We predict the possibility of realizing room-temperature superconductivity in
different 2D domains within the ceramic high-Tc cuprates at ambient pressure
and experimentally confirm this prediction of 2D room-temperature
superconductivity in the newly derived Bi/Pb-based ceramic cuprates containing
many grain boundaries, interfaces and multiplate blocks. We argue that, in
these high-Tc materials, besides bulk superconductivity in 3D domains there is
also strongly enhanced 2D superconductivity emerging in the 3D-2D crossover
region well above the superconducting transition temperature Tc. We study the
possibility of the existence of distinct 3D and 2D superconducting phases in
high-Tc ceramic cuprates, in which the unconventional Cooper pairs behave like
bosons and condense below certain critical temperatures into 3D and 2D Bose
superfluids in 3D and 2D domains. We show that the superconducting transition
temperature in 2D domains is much higher than in 3D domains and can reach up to
room temperature. We report signatures of room-temperature superconductivity
occurring at different grain boundaries and 3D/2D interfaces and in multiplate
blocks within the ceramic superconductors, synthesized by using the new melt
technology in a large solar furnace. The samples of these materials synthesized
under the influence of concentrated solar energy have the bulk Tc values
ranging from 100 K to about 140 K and the more higher superconducting
transition temperatures, possibly even as high as room temperature in the 3D-2D
crossover region. The remnant 2D superconductivity in newly derived Bi/Pb-based
ceramic cuprate superconductors is observed at temperatures 200-300 K well
above the bulk Tc and the onset of room-temperature superconductivity is
evidenced by the observations of a sharp step-like drop in the resistance and a
well-detectable partial Meissner effect at around 300 K and ambient pressure.

<h3>Spin-Lattice Coupling Induced Rich Magnetic States in CrF$_3$ monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02671</a>
<br>
<i>Fawei Zheng, Yong Lu</i>
<p>We systematically studied the spin-lattice couplings in the CrF$_3$
monolayer. Our study reveals that the spin exchange constants between the
nearest neighbors are notably affected by these couplings. Specifically, the
couplings arise predominantly from three distinct phonon modes, namely the
covariant, rotation, and stretch of the Cr-F-Cr-F rhombus. By integrating out
the phonon degrees of freedom, we derived an effective spin Hamiltonian
featuring four-spin product terms, which yields a remarkably intricate magnetic
phase diagram. Significantly, numerous plateau states characterized by
fractional magnetizations, including 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 1/5, 5/8, 1/9, and
2/9, emerge in the vicinity of the phase transition boundary separating
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. These findings show the profound
influence of spin-lattice couplings on magnetic properties near the magnetic
phase boundaries, and the predicted plateau states are expected to be
observable in future experiments.

<h3>Scaling Laws Governing the Elastic Properties of 3D-Graphenes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02689" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02689</a>
<br>
<i>Ming Li, Guo Lu, Haodong Yu, Menglei Li, Fawei Zheng</i>
<p>In this study, we have comprehensively investigated the scaling law for
elastic properties of three-dimensional honeycomb-like graphenes (3D-graphenes)
using hybrid neural network potential based molecular dynamics simulations and
theoretical analyses. The elastic constants as functions of honeycomb hole
size, denoted by the graphene wall length $L$, were provided. All five
independent elastic constants in the large $L$ limit are proportional to
$L^{-1}$. The associated coefficients are combinations of two-dimensional
graphene's elastic constants. High-order terms including $L^{-2}$ and $L^{-3}$
emerge for finite $L$ values. They have three origins, the distorted areas
close to the joint lines of 3D-graphenes, the variation of solid angles between
graphene plates, and the bending distortion of graphene plates. Significantly,
the chirality becomes essential with the decreasing of $L$, because the joint
line structures are different between the armchair and zigzag type
3D-graphenes. Our findings provide insights into the elastic properties of
graphene-based superstructures and can be used for further studies on
graphene-based materials.

<h3>Interlayer magnetic interactions and ferroelectricity in $π$/3-twisted  CrX$_2$ (X = Se, Te) bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02693</a>
<br>
<i>Wenqi Yang, Xinlong Yang, Menglei Li, Lin Hu, Fawei Zheng</i>
<p>Recently, two-dimensional (2D) bilayer magnetic systems have been widely
studied. Their interlayer magnetic interactions play a vital role in the
magnetic properties. In this paper, we theoretically studied the interlayer
magnetic interactions, magnetic states and ferroelectricity of $\pi$/3-twisted
CrX$_2$ (X = Se, Te) bilayers ($\pi$/3-CrX$_2$). Our study reveals that the
lateral shift could switch the magnetic state of the $\pi$/3-CrSe$_2$ between
interlayer ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, while just tuning the strength
of the interlayer antiferromagnetic interactions in $\pi$/3-CrTe$_2$.
Furthermore, the lateral shift can alter the off-plane electric polarization in
both $\pi$/3-CrSe$_2$ and $\pi$/3-CrTe$_2$. These results show that stacking is
an effective way to tune both the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of
1T-CrX$_2$ bilayers, making the 1T-CrX$_2$ bilayers hold promise for 2D
spintronic devices.

<h3>Single Crystal Growth and Transport Properties of van der Waals  Materials $AB$Te$_\mathbf{4}$ ($A/B$ = Ti, Zr, Hf)</h3>

<i>Yuto Hasuo, Takahiro Urata, Masaaki Araidai, Yuji Tsuchiya, Satoshi Awaji, Hiroshi Ikuta</i>
<p>Monolayers of $AB$Te$_4$ ($A$/$B$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) were theoretically predicted
to be two-dimensional topological insulators, but little has been known about
the physical properties of these compounds. Here, we report on the single
crystal growth, bulk transport properties, and band structure calculations of
these compounds. The magnetotransport properties indicate that all three
compounds are multi-carrier systems. The experimental results of ZrTiTe$_4$ and
HfTiTe$_4$ can be well fitted by the multi-carrier formula assuming two types
of carriers, while three carrier components were necessary for HfZrTe$_4$.
Interestingly, one of the carrier mobilities of HfZrTe$_4$ exceeded 1000
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, which was nearly one order in magnitude larger than the
carrier mobilities of ZrTiTe$_4$ and HfTiTe$_4$. Our band structure
calculations showed that all three compounds are semimetals consistent with the
magnetotransport properties. The band structure around the $\Gamma$-point of
HfZrTe$_4$ exhibits features that are distinct from the other two compounds,
which is likely the reason of the different carrier properties.

<h3>Distance dependence of the energy transfer mechanism in WS$_2$-graphene  heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02716</a>
<br>
<i>David Tebbe, Marc Schütte, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten, Lutz Waldecker</i>
<p>We report on the mechanism of energy transfer in van der Waals
heterostructures of the two-dimensional semiconductor WS$_2$ and graphene with
varying interlayer distances, achieved through spacer layers of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN). We record photoluminescence and reflection spectra at interlayer
distances between 0.5 nm and 5.8 nm (0-16 hBN layers). We find that the energy
transfer is dominated by states outside the light cone, indicative of a
F\"orster transfer process, with an additional contribution from a Dexter
process at 0.5 nm interlayer distance. We find that the measured dependence of
the luminescence intensity on interlayer distances above 1 nm can be
quantitatively described using recently reported values of the F\"orster
transfer rates of thermalized charge carriers. At smaller interlayer distances,
the experimentally observed transfer rates exceed the predictions and
furthermore depend on excess energy as well as on excitation density. Since the
transfer probability of the F\"orster mechanism depends on the momentum of
electron-hole pairs, we conclude that at these distances, the transfer is
driven by non-thermalized charge carrier distributions.

<h3>Critical and tricritical singularities from small-scale Monte Carlo  simulations: The Blume-Capel model in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02720</a>
<br>
<i>Leïla Moueddene, Nikolaos G Fytas, Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna, Bertrand Berche</i>
<p>We show that the study of critical properties of the Blume-Capel model at two
dimensions can be deduced from Monte Carlo simulations with good accuracy even
for small system sizes when one analyses the behaviour of the zeros of the
partition function. The phase diagram of the model displays a line of
second-order phase transitions ending at a tricritical point, then a line of
first-order transitions. We concentrate on critical and tricritical properties
and compare the accuracy achieved via standard finite-size scaling of
thermodynamic quantities with that from the zeros analysis. This latter
analysis showcases spectacular precision, even for systems as small as 64
spins! We also show that the zeros are very sensitive to subtle crossover
effects.

<h3>Compression-induced crossovers for the ground-state of classical dipole  lattices on a Möbius strip</h3>

<br>
<i>Ansgar Siemens, Felipe Augusto Oliveira Silveira, Peter Schmelcher</i>
<p>We explore the ground state properties of a lattice of classical dipoles
spanned on the surface of a M\"{o}bius strip. The dipole equilibrium
configurations depend significantly on the geometrical parameters of the
M\"{o}bius strip, as well as on the lattice dimensions. As a result of the
variable dipole spacing on the curved surface of the M\"{o}bius strip, the
ground state can consist of multiple domains with different dipole orientations
which are separated by domain walls. We analyze in particular the dependence of
the ground state dipole configuration on the width of the M\"{o}bius strip and
highlight two crossovers in the ground state that can be correspondingly tuned.
A first crossover changes the dipole lattice from a phase which resists
compression to a phase that favors it. The second crossover leads to an
exchange of the topological properties of the two involved domains. We conclude
with a brief summary and an outlook on more complex topologically intricate
surfaces.

<h3>Macromolecular crowding in chiral assembly of ellipsoidal nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02767</a>
<br>
<i>Jiaxin Hou, William Sampson, Ahu Gümrah Dumanli</i>
<p>Anisotropic colloidal particles have the ability to self-assemble into
cholesteric structures. We used molecular dynamics to simulate the
self-assembly of ellipsoidal particles with the objective to establish a
general framework to reveal the primary factors driving chiral interactions. To
characterize these interactions, we introduce a characteristic parameter
following the crowding factor (CF) theory. Our simulations and statistical
analysis showed good agreement with the CF theory; at the early stages of the
assembly process, the ellipsoidal particles go through a critical aggregation
point followed by further clustering towards nematic order. Further, we
demonstrate that in high CF conditions, small initial clusters may induce a
chiral twist which subsequently forms a cholesteric structure with no
directional preference in higher organization states.

<h3>Detecting Phase Transitions through Nonequilibrium Work Fluctuations</h3>

<i>Matteo Colangeli, Antonio Di Francesco, Lamberto Rondoni</i>
<p>We show how averages of exponential functions of path dependent quantities,
such as those of Work Fluctuation Theorems, detect phase transitions in
deterministic and stochastic systems. State space truncation -- the restriction
of the observations to a subset of state space with prescribed probability --
is introduced to obtain that result. Two stochastic processes undergoing
first-order phase transitions are analyzed both analytically and numerically:
the Ehrenfest urn model and the 2D Ising model subject to a magnetic field. In
presence of phase transitions, we prove that even minimal state space
truncation makes averages of exponentials of path dependent variables sensibly
deviate from full state space values. Specifically, in the case of
discontinuous phase transitions, this approach is strikingly effective in
locating the critical transition value of the control parameter. As this
approach works even with variables different from those of fluctuation
theorems, it provides a new recipe to identify order parameters in the study of
nonequilibrium phase transitions, profiting from the often incomplete
statistics that are available.

<p>The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic
structures was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field
up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial
increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation vector
of the antiferromagnetic phase, responsible for the significant increase in
magnetoelectric coupling, i.e., stronger changes of ferroelectric polarization
with applied magnetic field than in other multiferroic materials. This shows
that even a small 2% substitution of $Mn^{3+}$ by $Fe^{3+}$ significantly
enhances the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic
cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T.

<h3>Two Displacive Ferroelectric Phase Transitions in Multiferroic Quadruple  Perovskite $BiMn_{7}O_{12}$</h3>

<i>A. Maia, M. Kempa, V. Bovtun, R. Vilarinho, C. Kadlec, J. Agostinho Moreira, A. A. Belik, P. Proschek, S. Kamba</i>
<p>We report on the microwave, terahertz (THz), infrared and Raman spectroscopic
studies of $BiMn_{7}O_{12}$ ceramics, shedding more light into the nature of
two structural phase transitions and their possible relation with
ferroelectricity in this compound. We observed a softening of one polar phonon
in the THz range on cooling towards 460 and 300 K, i.e., temperatures at which
$BiMn_{7}O_{12}$ undergoes subsequent structural phase transitions from
monoclinic $\textit{I2/m}$ to polar monoclinic $\textit{Im}$ and triclinic
$\textit{P1}$ phases. The soft phonon causes dielectric anomalies typical for
displacive ferroelectric phase transitions. Microwave measurements performed at
5.8 GHz up to 400 K qualitatively confirmed not only the dielectric anomaly at
300 K, but also revealed two other weak dielectric anomalies near the magnetic
phase transitions at 60 K and 28 K. This evidences the multiferroic nature of
the low-temperature phases, although the relatively high conductivity in the
kHz and Hz spectral range prevented us from directly measuring the permittivity
and ferroelectric polarization. Some Raman modes sense the magnetic phase
transitions occurring near 60 and 25 K, showing that spin-phonon coupling is
relevant in this compound and in this temperature range. The deviation of the
Mn-O stretching mode frequency from the anharmonic temperature behavior was
successfully explained by the spin correlation function calculated from the
magnetic contribution to the specific heat.

<h3>Integrated ab initio modelling of atomic order and magnetic anisotropy  for rare-earth-free magnet design: effects of alloying additions in  $\mathrm{L}1_0$ FeNi</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02809" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02809</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher D. Woodgate, Laura H. Lewis, Julie B. Staunton</i>
<p>We describe an integrated modelling approach to accelerate the search for
novel, single-phase, multicomponent materials with high magnetocrystalline
anisotropy (MCA). For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering,
its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the
consequent MCA. Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio
description of the material's electronic structure determines both aspects. We
demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions
in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometry Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$,
including $X = $ Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on
adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich
and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to
establish the tetragonal $\mathrm{L}1_0$ order suited for significant MCA. Our
results show that when alloying additions are included in this material,
annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie
temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect
on the predicted MCA.

<h3>Fluctuation theorems and distribution functions for polar molecules in  an electric field</h3>

<br>
<i>Debra J. Searles, Stephen Sanderson</i>
<p>In this perspective we consider how modern statistical mechanics and response
theory can be applied to understand the response of polar molecules to an
applied electric field and the fluctuations in these systems. Results that are
consistent with thermodynamics and physical expectations are derived, as well
as a new fluctuation relation that is tested in molecular simulations. It is
demonstrated that a deterministic approach leads to distribution functions that
continually evolve, even when system properties have relaxed, which has
implications for treatment of nonequilibrium steady states.

<h3>Selection of Alternative Local Interconnect Metals: Beyond Traditional  Criteria Towards Sustainable and Secure Supply Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02864" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02864</a>
<br>
<i>Lizzie Boakes, Lars-Åke Ragnarsson, Cédric Rolin, Christoph Adelmann</i>
<p>In response to aggressive scaling demands in semiconductor manufacturing and
the growing need to apply sustainable practices, this paper presents a holistic
sustainability assessment framework for evaluating alternative metals for
advanced applications. The framework, consisting of seven sustainability
aspects, aims to guide researchers and industry stakeholders towards decisions
fostering a more sustainable and secure future for microelectronics. This study
applies the framework to assess the sustainability of alternative local
interconnect metals. The framework identifies five metals (Ti, Al, Ni, Co, and
Mo) with relatively favourable performance in at least six out of nine specific
indicators, while others (Pt, Ru, Ir, Rh, and Pd) exhibit poorer sustainability
metrics. The study recommends further analyses, suggesting the incorporation of
case-specific functional units and the use of normalization and weighting
factors for a comprehensive evaluation. Coupled with traditional technological
assessments, this framework equips decision-makers with essential tools to
broaden criteria for selecting alternative metals, aligning semiconductor
manufacturing with broader sustainability objectives.

<h3>Spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet: Machine learning discovery  of the spinon pair density wave ground state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02866</a>
<br>
<i>Tanja Duric, Jia Hui Chung, Bo Yang, Pinaki Sengupta</i>
<p>Spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) is one of the most studied models in
frustrated magnetism since it is a promising candidate to host exotic spin
liquid states. However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and
numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations
in this system remain elusive. This is related to the difficulty in determining
the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our
investigation of the Kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant
convolutional neural networks - an advanced machine learning technique for
studying strongly frustrated models. The approach, combined with variational
Monte Carlo, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results
accuracy in comparison with approaches based on other neural network
architectures that lack generalization quality for frustrated spin systems.
Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, that
predicted Z_2 or U(1) Dirac spin liquid states, our results strongly indicate
that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair
density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice
symmetries. The found state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing
instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum and
resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of
underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase. The
state has significantly lower energy than the lowest energy states found by the
SU(2) symmetric density matrix renormalization group calculations and other
methods.

<p>Rydberg excitons (analogues of Rydberg atoms in condensed matter systems) are
highly excited bound electron-hole states with large Bohr radii. The
interaction between them as well as exciton coupling to light may lead to
strong optical nonlinearity, with applications in sensing and quantum
information processing. Here, we achieve strong effective photon-photon
interactions (Kerr-like optical nonlinearity) via the Rydberg blockade
phenomenon and the hybridisation of excitons and photons forming polaritons in
a Cu$_2$O-filled microresonators. Under pulsed resonant excitation polariton
resonance frequencies are renormalised due to the reduction of the
photon-exciton coupling with increasing exciton density. Theoretical analysis
shows that the Rydberg blockade plays a major role in the experimentally
observed scaling of the polariton nonlinearity coefficient as $\propto n^{4.4
\pm 1.8}$ for principal quantum numbers up to n = 7. Such high principal
quantum numbers studied in a polariton system for the first time are essential
for realisation of high Rydberg optical nonlinearities, which paves the way
towards quantum optical applications and fundamental studies of
strongly-correlated photonic (polaritonic) states in a solid state system.

<h3>Hard-sphere model of the B2 to B19' phase transformation, and its  application to predict the B19' structure in NiTi alloys and the B19  structures in other binary alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02871</a>
<br>
<i>Cyril Cayron</i>
<p>The pseudoelastic and pseudoplastic properties of NiTi alloys result from the
closeness of the structures between the B2 cubic austenite and the B19'
monoclinic martensite, and the facility to transform one into each other. Until
now, the paths followed by the atoms during the B2 to B19' transformation were
imagined as independent shears and shuffles. Here, we propose a simplified
hard-sphere atomistic model of phase transformation decomposed into three
distinct types of atomic movements. The model's inputs are the Ti and Ni atomic
or ionic diameters and the monoclinic angle beta. The outputs are the lattice
parameters of the B19' phase and the atomic positions. The results are
remarkably close to those reported in the literature from X-ray diffraction
experiments or DFT simulations. The hard-sphere model explains the change of
enthalpy by the formation of short Ti-Ti bonds in B19'. It is also shown that
the value of the monoclinic angle beta close to 97.9 degrees corresponds to the
highest molar volume among all the possible hard-sphere monoclinic B19'
structures; which suggests that it could be a consequence of a maximization of
the vibrational entropy. The hard-sphere model was applied in the special case
of absence of monoclinicity to predict the B19 structure. The calculations do
not agree well with the B19 structure reported in NiTi alloys; they are however
in excellent agreement with the B19 structures reported in other binary alloys,
such as in AuTi, PdTi, and AuCd.

<h3>GW Theory of Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02872</a>
<br>
<i>Jihang Zhu, Iacopo Torre, Marco Polini, Allan H. MacDonald</i>
<p>Strong correlations occur in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)
when the octet of flat moir\'e minibands centered on charge neutrality (CN) is
partially occupied. The octet consists of a single valence band and a single
conduction band for each of four degenerate spin-valley flavors. Motivated by
the importance of Hartree electrostatic interactions in determining the
filling-factor dependent band structure, we use a time-dependent Hartree (GW)
approximation to gain insight into electronic correlations. We find that the
electronic compressibility is dominated by Hartree interactions, that
paramagnetic states are stable over a range of density near CN, and that the
dependence of energy on flavor polarization is strongly overestimated by
mean-field theory.

<h3>Inversion Ring in Chromonic Twisted Hedgehogs: Theory and Experiment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02893" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02893</a>
<br>
<i>Federica Ciuchi, Maria Penelope De Santo, Silvia Paparini, Lorenza Spina, Epifanio G. Virga</i>
<p>Twisted hedgehogs are defects in spherical cavities with homeotropic
anchoring for the nematic director that arise when twist distortions are
sufficiently less energetic than splay (and bend) distortions. They bear a
characteristic inversion ring, where the director texture changes the sense it
spirals about the center of the cavity. This paper applies a quartic twist
theory recently proposed to describe the elasticity of chromonics to explain a
series of inversion rings observed in aqueous solutions of SSY at two different
concentrations. The theory features a phenomenological length a, whose measure
is extracted from the data and shown to be fairly independent of the cavity
radius, as expected for a material constant.

<h3>Temperature dependence of microwave losses in lumped-element resonators  made from superconducting nanowires with high kinetic inductance</h3>

<br>
<i>Ermes Scarano, Elisabet K. Arvidsson, August K. Roos, Erik Holmgren, David B. Haviland</i>
<p>We study the response of several microwave resonators made from
superconducting NbTiN thin-film meandering nanowires with large kinetic
inductance, having different circuit topology and coupling to the transmission
line. Reflection measurements reveal the parameters of the circuit and analysis
of their temperature dependence in the range 1.7-6 K extract the
superconducting energy gap and critical temperature. The lumped-element LC
resonator, valid in our frequency range of interest, allows us to predict the
quasiparticle contribution to internal loss, independent of circuit topology
and characteristic impedance. Our analysis shows that the internal quality
factor is limited not by thermal-equilibrium quasiparticles, but an additional
temperature-dependent source of internal microwave loss.
