<h3>Yukawa interactions at Large Charge</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05839v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05839v1</a>
<br>
<i>Oleg Antipin, Jahmall Bersini, Pantelis Panopoulos</i>

<br>
We extend the fixed-charge semiclassical method by computing anomalous
dimensions of fixed-charge scalar operators in models with Yukawa interactions.
In particular, we discuss the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-Yukawa theory as well as an
asymptotically safe gauge-Yukawa model in four dimensions. In the weakly
coupled regime, we cross-check our results to the respective maximum known
orders of perturbation theory in these models and predict higher order terms
for future comparisons with other computational methods. In the strongly
coupled regime, we match our results to the predictions of the large-charge
effective field theory which can be compared to future Monte Carlo and lattice
studies.

<h3>A versatile platform for graphene nanoribbon synthesis, electronic decoupling, and spin polarized measurements</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05760v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05760v1</a>

The on-surface synthesis of nano-graphenes has led the charge in prototyping
structures with perspectives beyond silicon-based technology. Following reports
of open-shell systems in graphene-nanoribbons (GNR), a flurry of research
activities is directed at investigating their magnetic properties with a keen
eye for spintronic applications. Although the synthesis of nano-graphenes is
usually straightforward on gold, it is difficult to use it for electronic
decoupling and spin-polarized measurements. Using a binary alloy Cu3Au(111), we
show how to combine the efficient gold-like nano-graphene formation with spin
polarization and electronic decoupling known from copper. We prepare copper
oxide layers, demonstrate thermally and tip-assisted synthesis of GNR and grow
thermally stable magnetic Co islands. We functionalize the tip of a scanning
tunneling microscope with carbon-monoxide, nickelocene, or attach Co clusters
for high-resolution imaging, magnetic sensing, or spin-polarized measurements.
This versatile platform will be a valuable tool in the advanced study of
magnetic nano-graphenes.

<h3>Electron magnetic moment of chiral phonons</h3>

High intensity THz lasers allow for the coherent excitation of individual
phonon modes. The ultrafast control of emergent magnetism by means of phonons
opens up new tuning mechanisms for functional materials. While theoretically
predicted phonon magnetic moments are tiny, recent experiments hint towards a
significant magnetization in various materials. To explain these phenomena, we
derive a coupling mechanism between the phonon angular momentum and the
electron spin. This coupling introduces the transient level-splitting of
spin-up and spin-down channels and a resulting magnetization. We estimate this
magnetization on the example of the lowest infrared active mode in the
perovskite KTaO$_3$. Our results show an electronic magnetic moment of $\approx
0.2$ $\mu_B$ per unit cell, depending on the doping level and electron
temperature.

<h3>Ferromagnetism and Skyrmions in the Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05960v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05960v1</a>
<br>
<i>Felix A. Palm, Mert Kurttutan, Annabelle Bohrdt, Ulrich Schollwck, Fabian Grusdt</i>
<br>
<br>
Strongly interacting fermionic systems host a variety of interesting quantum
many-body states with exotic excitations. For instance, the interplay of strong
interactions and the Pauli exclusion principle can lead to Stoner
ferromagnetism, but the fate of this state remains unclear when kinetic terms
are added. While in many lattice models the fermions' dispersion results in
delocalization and destabilization of the ferromagnet, flat bands can restore
strong interaction effects and ferromagnetic correlations. To reveal this
interplay, here we propose to study the Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model using
ultracold atoms. We demonstrate, by performing large-scale DMRG simulations,
that this model exhibits a lattice analog of the quantum Hall ferromagnet at
magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$. We reveal the nature of the low energy
spin-singlet states around $\nu\approx1$ and find that they host
quasi-particles and quasi-holes exhibiting spin-spin correlations reminiscent
of skyrmions. Finally, we predict the breakdown of flat-band ferromagnetism at
large fields. Our work paves the way towards experimental studies of lattice
quantum Hall ferromagnetism, including prospects to study many-body states of
interacting skyrmions and explore the relation to high-$T_{\rm c}$
superconductivity.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05953v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05953v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jian Kang, Oskar Vafek</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the method developed in the companion paper, we construct the effective
continuum theories for two different microscopic tight binding models of the
twisted bilayer graphene at the twist angle of $1.05^\circ$, one Slater-Koster
based and the other ab-initio Wannier based. The energy spectra obtained from
the continuum theory -- either for rigid twist or including lattice relaxation
-- are found to be in nearly perfect agreement with the spectra from the tight
binding models when the gradient expansion is carried out to second order,
demonstrating the validity of the method. We also analyze the properties of the
Bloch states of the resulting narrow bands, finding non-negligible
particle-hole symmetry breaking near the $\Gamma$ point in our continuum theory
constructed for the ab-initio based microscopic model due to a term in the
continuum theory that was previously overlooked. This reveals the difference
with all existing continuum models where the particle-hole symmetry of the
narrow band Hilbert space is nearly perfect.

</body><h3>Direct observation of non-local fermion pairing in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard gas</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05948v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05948v1</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Hartke, Botond Oreg, Carter Turnbaugh, Ningyuan Jia, Martin Zwierlein</i>
<br>
<br>
Pairing of fermions lies at the heart of superconductivity, the hierarchy of
nuclear binding energies and superfluidity of neutron stars. The Hubbard model
of attractively interacting fermions provides a paradigmatic setting for
fermion pairing, featuring a crossover between Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
of tightly bound pairs and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity of
long-range Cooper pairs, and a "pseudo-gap" region where pairs form already
above the superfluid critical temperature. We here directly observe the
non-local nature of fermion pairing in a Hubbard lattice gas, employing spin-
and density-resolved imaging of $\sim$1000 fermionic ${}^{40}$K atoms under a
bilayer microscope. Complete fermion pairing is revealed by the vanishing of
global spin fluctuations with increasing attraction. In the strongly correlated
regime, the fermion pair size is found to be on the order of the average
interparticle spacing. We resolve polaronic correlations around individual
spins, resulting from the interplay of non-local pair fluctuations and
charge-density-wave order. Our techniques open the door toward in-situ
observation of fermionic superfluids in a Hubbard lattice gas.

</body><h3>Formation of spin and charge ordering in the extended Hubbard model during a finite-time quantum quench</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05945v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05945v1</a>
<br>
<i>Isaac M. Carvalho, Helena Bragana, Walber H. Brito, Maria C. O. Aguiar</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the formation of charge and spin ordering by starting from a
non-interacting state and studying how it evolves in time under a Hamiltonian
with finite electronic interactions. We consider the one-dimensional,
half-filled extended Hubbard model, which we solve within time-dependent
density matrix renormalization group. By employing linear finite-time quenches
in the onsite and nearest-neighbor interactions, we find the existence of
impulse, intermediate, and adiabatic regimes of time evolution. For the
quenches we analyze, we observe that the adiabatic regime is reached with
distinct ramping time scales depending on whether the charge density wave (CDW)
or the spin density wave (SDW) is formed. The former needs to be slower than
the latter to prevent entangled excited states from being accessed during the
quench. More interestingly, in the intermediate regime, we observe an
enhancement of the entanglement entropy with respect to its initial value,
which precedes the formation of the CDW ordering; a similar enhancement is not
seen in the quench towards SDW. Our findings also show that the breaking of the
system integrability, by turning on the nearest-neighbor interactions, does not
give rise to significant changes in the non-equilibrium behavior within the
adiabatic approximation.

</body><h3>Trion magnetic polarons in (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mn,Mg)Te quantum wells</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05943v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05943v1</a>
<br>
<i>F. Godejohann, R. R. Akhmadullin, K. V. Kavokin, D. R. Yakovlev, I. A. Akimov, B. R. Namozov, Yu. G. Kusrayev, G. Karczewski, T. Wojtowicz, M. Bayer</i>
<br>
<br>
A trion magnetic polaron formed by the exchange interaction of a positively
charged exciton (trion) with localized spins of Mn$^{2+}$ ions is found
experimentally in a 4\,nm wide
Cd$_{0.98}$Mn$_{0.02}$Te/Cd$_{0.78}$Mn$_{0.02}$Mg$_{0.2}$Te quantum well
containing resident holes. The experiment is performed at a temperature of 1.6
K using resonant excitation of the trion with circularly polarized light. The
trion is formed from a resident hole, which is in a hole magnetic polaron
state, and a photogenerated electron-hole pair. The dynamical evolution from
the hole magnetic polaron to the trion magnetic polaron is accompanied by a
spin-flip of the electron, which results in negative circular polarization of
the photoluminescence. The degree of circular polarization reaches $-8\%$ at
zero magnetic field and strongly decreases in transverse magnetic fields
exceeding 0.2 T. Our model considerations show that different localization
sizes of the resident and photogenerated holes and the resulting difference in
their exchange interaction with the Mn$^{2+}$ spins maintains Mn spin
polarization. The resulting exchange field of Mn acting on the electron
provides a robust spin polarization of the trion magnetic polaron. We evaluate
the electron exchange energy in the T$^+$MP to be 0.19~meV, and the T$^+$MP
binding energy to be about 0.5 - 1 meV.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05937v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05937v1</a>
<br>
<i>Indranil Mukherjee, Adarsh Raghu, P. K. Mohanty</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and study a model of hardcore particles obeying run-and-tumble
dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice, where particles run in either +ve or -ve
$x$-direction with an effective speed $v$ and tumble (change their direction of
motion) with a constant rate $\omega.$ We show that the coarse-grained dynamics
of the system can be mapped to a beads-in-urn model called misanthrope process
where particles are identified as urns and vacancies as beads that hop to a
neighbouring urn situated in the direction opposite to the current. The hop
rate, same as the magnitude of the current, depends on the total number of
beads present in the departure and the arrival urn; we calculate it
analytically and show that it does not satisfy the criteria required for a
phase separation transition. Tumbling is generally detrimental to the stability
of jamming; thus, our results for this restricted tumbling model strongly
suggest that motility induced phase separation transition can not occur in one
dimension.

</body><h3>Continuum effective Hamiltonian for graphene bilayers for an arbitrary smooth lattice deformation from microscopic theories</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05933v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05933v1</a>
<br>
<i>Oskar Vafek, Jian Kang</i>
<br>
<br>
We provide a systematic real space derivation of the continuum Hamiltonian
for a graphene bilayer starting from a microscopic lattice theory, allowing for
an arbitrary inhomogeneous smooth lattice deformation, including a twist. Two
different microscopic models are analyzed: first, a Slater-Koster like model
and second, ab-initio derived model. We envision that our effective Hamiltonian
can be used in conjunction with an experimentally determined atomic lattice
deformation in twisted bilayer graphene in a specific device to predict and
compare the electronic spectra with scanning tunneling spectroscopy
measurements. As a byproduct, our approach provides electron-phonon couplings
in the continuum Hamiltonian from microscopic models for any bilayer stacking.
In the companion paper we analyze in detail the continuum models for relaxed
atomic configurations of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene.

</body><h3>Critical slowing down of fermions near a magnetic quantum phase transition</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05932v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05932v1</a>
<br>
<i>Chia-Jung Yang, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Johann Kroha, Manfred Fiebig, Shovon Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
A universal phenomenon in phase transitions is critical slowing down (CSD) -
systems, after an initial perturbation, take an exceptionally long time to
return to equilibrium. It is universally observed in the dynamics of bosonic
excitations, like order-parameter collective modes, but it is not generally
expected to occur for fermionic excitations because of the half-integer nature
of the fermionic spin. Direct observation of CSD in fermionic excitations or
quasiparticles would therefore be of fundamental significance. Here, we observe
fermionic CSD in the heavy-fermion (HF) compound YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ by terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy. HFs are compound objects with a strongly enhanced
effective mass, composed of itinerant and localized electronic states. We see
that near the quantum phase transition in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ the build-up of
spectral weight of the HFs towards the Kondo temperature $T_K\approx 25$ K is
followed by a logarithmic rise of the quasiparticle excitation rate on the
heavy-Fermi-liquid side of the quantum phase transition below $10$ K. A
critical two-band HF liquid theory shows that this is indicative of fermionic
CSD. This CSD is a clear indication that the HF quasiparticles experience a
breakdown near the quantum phase transition, and the critical exponent of this
breakdown introduces a classification of fermionic quantum phase transitions
analogous to thermodynamic phase transitions - solution to a long-standing
problem.

</body><h3>Photoemission "experiments" on holographic lattices</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05920v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05920v1</a>
<br>
<i>Filip Herek, Vladan Gecin, Mihailo ubrovi</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct a 2D holographic ionic lattice with hyperscaling-violating
infrared geometry and study single-electron spectral functions ("ARPES
photoemission curves") on this background. The spectra typically show a
three-peak structure, where the central peak undergoes a crossover from a sharp
but not Fermi-liquid-like quasiparticle to a wide incoherent maximum, and the
broad side peaks resemble the Hubbard bands. These findings are partially
explained by a perturbative near-horizon analysis of the bulk Dirac equation.
Comparing the holographic Green functions in imaginary frequency with the Green
functions of the Hubbard model obtained from quantum Monte Carlo, we find that
the holographic model provides a very good fit to the Hubbard Green function.
However, the information loss when transposing the holographic Green functions
to imaginary frequencies implies that a deeper connection to Hubbard-like
models remains questionable.

</body><h3>Reversible canted persistent spin textures with large spin splitting in two-dimensional ferroelectric bilayer WTe$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05902v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05902v1</a>
<br>
<i>Moh. Adhib Ulil Absor, Iman Santoso</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of materials hosting persistent spin texture (PST) opens
an avenue for the realization of energy-saving spintronics since they support
an extraordinarily long spin lifetime. However, the stability of the PST is
sensitively affected by symmetry breaking of the crystal induced by external
perturbation such as the electric field. In this paper, through
first-principles calculations supplemented by symmetry analysis, we report the
emergence of the robust and stable PST with large spin splitting in the
two-dimensional ferroelectric bilayer WTe$_{2}$. Due to the low symmetry of the
crystal ($C_{s}$ point group), we observe a canted PST in the spin-split bands
around the Fermi level displaying a unidirectional spin configuration tilted
along the $yz$ plane in the first Brillouin zone. Such a typical PST can be
effectively reversed by out-of-plane ferroelectric switching induced by
interlayer sliding along the in-plane direction. We further demonstrated that
the reversible PST is realized by the application of an out-of-plane external
electric field. Thus, our findings uncover the possibility of an electrically
tunable PST in the 2D materials, offering a promising platform for highly
efficient spintronics devices.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05899v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05899v1</a>
<br>
<i>Keisuke Totsuka</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the ground-state properties of the SU(N)-generalization of the
Kondo-lattice model in one dimension when the Kondo coupling J_K (both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic) is sufficiently strong. Both cases can be
realized using alkaline-earth-like cold gases in optical lattices.
Specifically, we first carry out the strong-coupling expansion and identify two
insulating phases (one of which is the SU(N)-analogue of the well-known gapped
Kondo singlet phase). We then rigorously establish that the ground state in the
low-density (for J_K<0) or the high-density (for J_K>0) region is
ferromagnetic. The results are accounted for by generalizing the
double-exchange mechanism to SU(N) "spins". Possible realizations of Bose-Fermi
supersymmetry SU(N|1) in the (generalized) SU(N) Kondo-lattice model are
discussed as well.

For a four stroke asymmetrically driven quantum Otto engine with working
medium modeled by a single qubit, we study the bounds on non-equilibrium
fluctuations for work and heat. We find strict relations between the
fluctuations of work and individual heat for hot and cold reservoirs in
arbitrary operational regime. Focusing on the engine regime, we show that the
ratio of non-equilibrium fluctuations for output work and input heat from the
hot reservoir is both upper and lower bounded. As a consequence, we establish
interesting hierarchical relation between the relative fluctuations of work and
heat for both cold and hot reservoirs and further make a connection with the
thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We discuss the fate of these bounds also in
the refrigerator regime. The reported bounds, for such asymmetrically driven
engines, emerge once both the time-forward and the corresponding reversed
cycles of the engine are considered on an equal footing. We also extend our
study and report bounds for a parametrically driven harmonic oscillator Otto
engine.

The Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory started with the pioneering
work of Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai and Wolynes. It leverages the methods and
advances of the theory of disordered systems. It fares remarkably well at
reproducing the salient experimental facts of super-cooled liquids. Yet, direct
and indisputable experimental validations are missing. In this short survey, we
will review recent investigations that broadly support all static aspects of
RFOT, but also those for which the standard dynamical extension of the theory
appears to be struggling, in particular in relation with facilitation effects.
We discuss possible solutions and open issues.

We extend the fixed-charge semiclassical method by computing anomalous
dimensions of fixed-charge scalar operators in models with Yukawa interactions.
In particular, we discuss the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-Yukawa theory as well as an
asymptotically safe gauge-Yukawa model in four dimensions. In the weakly
coupled regime, we cross-check our results to the respective maximum known
orders of perturbation theory in these models and predict higher order terms
for future comparisons with other computational methods. In the strongly
coupled regime, we match our results to the predictions of the large-charge
effective field theory which can be compared to future Monte Carlo and lattice
studies.

The electronic structures of the iron-based superconductors have been
intensively studied by using angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).
A considerable amount of research has been focused on the LaFeAsO family,
showing the highest transition temperatures, where previous ARPES studies have
found much larger Fermi surfaces than bulk theoretical calculations would
predict. The discrepancy has been attributed to the presence of
termination-dependent surface states. Here, using photoemission spectroscopy
with a sub-micron focused beam spot (nano-ARPES) we have successfully measured
the electronic structures of both the LaO and FeAs terminations in LaFeAsO. Our
data reveal very different band dispersions and core-level spectra for
different surface terminations, showing that previous macro-focus ARPES
measurements were incomplete. Our results give direct evidence for the
surface-driven electronic structure reconstruction in LaFeAsO, including
formation of the termination-dependent surface states at the Fermi level. This
new experimental technique, which we have shown to be very powerful when
applied to this prototypical compound, can now be used to study various
materials with different surface terminations.

<br>

In the last decades, dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and its diagrammatic
extensions have been successfully applied to describe local and nonlocal
correlation effects in correlated electron systems. Unfortunately, except for
the exact solution, it is impossible to fulfill both the Pauli principle and
conservation laws at the same time. Consequently, fundamental observables such
as the kinetic and potential energies are ambiguously defined. In this work we
propose an approach to overcome the ambiguity in the calculation of the
potential energy within the ladder dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A)
by introducing an effective mass renormalization parameter in both the charge
and the spin susceptibility of the system. We then apply our method to the half
filled single-band Hubbard model on a three-dimensional cubic lattice. We find:
(i) at weak-to-intermediate coupling a reasonable modification of the
transition temperature $T_\text{N}$ to the antiferromagnetic ordered state with
respect to previous ladder D$\Gamma$A calculations without charge
renormalization. This is in good agreement with dual fermion and Monte Carlo
results; (ii) the renormalization of charge fluctuations in our new approach
leads to a unique value for the potential energy which is substantially lower
than corresponding ones from DMFT and non-selfconsistent ladder D$\Gamma$A;
(iii) the hierarchy of the kinetic energies between the DMFT and the ladder
D$\Gamma$A in the weak coupling regime is restored by the consideration of
charge renormalization.

Studies on polyhydrides are attracting growing attentions recently due to
their potential high temperature superconductivity (SC). We here report the
discovery of SC in hafnium polyhydrides at high pressures. The hafnium
superhydrides are synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions
using diamond anvil cell in combination with in-situ high pressure laser
heating technique. The SC was investigated by in-situ high pressure resistance
measurements in applied magnetic fields. A superconducting transition with
onset Tc ~83 K was observed at 243 GPa. The upper critical field Hc2(0) was
estimated to be 24 Tesla by GL theory and the consequent superconducting
coherent length to be ~37 Angstroms. Our results suggest that the
superconducting phase is from C2/m-HfH14. This is the first 5d transition metal
polyhydride superconductor with Tc above the liquid nitrogen temperature.

The AC Josephson effect predicted in 1962 and observed experimentally in 1963
as quantised voltage steps (the Shapiro steps) from photon assisted tunnelling
of Cooper pairs is among the most fundamental phenomena of quantum mechanics
and is vital for metrological quantum voltage standards. The physically dual
effect, the AC coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), photon assisted tunnelling
of magnetic fluxes through a superconducting nanowire, is envisaged to reveal
itself as quantised current steps. The basic physical significance of the AC
CQPS is also complemented by practical importance in future current standards;
a missing element for closing the Quantum Metrology Triangle. In 2012, the CQPS
was demonstrated as superposition of magnetic flux quanta in superconducting
nanowires. However the direct sharp current steps in superconductors; the only
unavailable basic effect of superconductivity to date, was unattainable due to
lack of appropriate materials and challenges in circuit engineering. Here we
report the direct observation of the dual Shapiro steps in a superconducting
nanowire. The sharp steps are clear up to 26 GHz frequency with current values
8.3 nA and limited by the present setup bandwidth. The current steps have been
theoretically predicted in small Josephson junctions (JJs) 30 years ago.
However, broadening unavoidable in JJs prevents their direct experimental
observation. We solve this problem by placing a thin NbN nanowire in an
inductive environment.

The on-surface synthesis of nano-graphenes has led the charge in prototyping
structures with perspectives beyond silicon-based technology. Following reports
of open-shell systems in graphene-nanoribbons (GNR), a flurry of research
activities is directed at investigating their magnetic properties with a keen
eye for spintronic applications. Although the synthesis of nano-graphenes is
usually straightforward on gold, it is difficult to use it for electronic
decoupling and spin-polarized measurements. Using a binary alloy Cu3Au(111), we
show how to combine the efficient gold-like nano-graphene formation with spin
polarization and electronic decoupling known from copper. We prepare copper
oxide layers, demonstrate thermally and tip-assisted synthesis of GNR and grow
thermally stable magnetic Co islands. We functionalize the tip of a scanning
tunneling microscope with carbon-monoxide, nickelocene, or attach Co clusters
for high-resolution imaging, magnetic sensing, or spin-polarized measurements.
This versatile platform will be a valuable tool in the advanced study of
magnetic nano-graphenes.

</body><h3>Universal behavior of magnon-mediated spin transport in disordered NM/NM/FI heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05759v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05759v1</a>
<br>
<i>Gaoyang Li, Fuming Xu, Jian Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically investigate the magnon-mediated spin transport and scaling
behaviors of a nonmagnetic metal/nonmagnetic metal/ferromagnetic insulator
(NM/NM/FI) heterostructure in the presence of Anderson disorders. For the
two-dimensional (2D) NM/NM/FI system, an enhancement of spin conductance in the
weak disorder regime is found due to the increasing of the interfacial density
of states (DOS) at NM/FI interface. As a result, a new scaling regime is
uncovered in the metallic regime where the spin conductance fluctuation rms(G)
scales linearly with the average spin conductance <G>, independent of system
parameters such as Fermi energies and temperatures. The competition between the
disorder-enhanced interfacial DOS and disorder-suppressed spin transport
results in a non-monotonic dependence of average spin conductance on disorder
strength. In the localized regime, the variance of lnG for different system
parameters follows a universal function that depends linearly on the average of
logarithm of spin conductance <lnG>.The distribution of lnG in the localized
regime is non-Gaussian whose deviation from Gaussian can be characterized by
the third and fourth order cumulants of lnG, denoted as k3 and k4,
respectively. We find that k3~<-lnG>^3/2 and k4~<lnG>^2. This suggests that the
spin conductance mediated by magnon in NM/NM/FI hybrid systems belongs to a
different universality class. For fixed <lnG>, the lnG distribution in the
localized regime for different system parameters is found to collapse onto a
single curve, suggesting the distribution P(lnG;<lnG>) is a universal function
that depends only on <lnG>. Furthermore, spin thermopower S in the presence of
disorder is studied and the variance of lnS is found to scale linearly with
<lnS> for different system parameters in the localized regime. Spin conductance
and spin thermopower for 1D NM/NM/FI are also studied.

<br>
<i>Arnob Kumar Ghosh, Tanay Nag, Arijit Saha</i>
<br>

We propose a practically feasible time-periodic sinusoidal drive protocol in
onsite mass term to generate the two-dimensional~(2D) Floquet second-order
topological superconductor, hosting both the regular $0$- and anomalous
$\pi$-Majorana corner modes~(MCMs) while starting from a static 2D topological
insulator/$d$-wave superconductor heterostructure setup. We theoretically study
the local density spectra and the time dynamics of MCMs in the presence of such
drive. The dynamical MCMs are topologically characterized by employing the
average quadrupolar motion. Furthermore, we employ the Floquet perturbation
theory~(FPT) in the strong driving amplitude limit to provide analytical
insight into the problem. We compare our exact (numerical), and the FPT results
in terms of the eigenvalue spectra and the time dynamics of the MCMs. We
emphasize that the agreement between the exact numerical and the FPT results
are more prominent in the higher frequency regime.

<br>
<i>R. Matthias Geilhufe, Wolfram Hergert</i>
<br>
<br>
High intensity THz lasers allow for the coherent excitation of individual
phonon modes. The ultrafast control of emergent magnetism by means of phonons
opens up new tuning mechanisms for functional materials. While theoretically
predicted phonon magnetic moments are tiny, recent experiments hint towards a
significant magnetization in various materials. To explain these phenomena, we
derive a coupling mechanism between the phonon angular momentum and the
electron spin. This coupling introduces the transient level-splitting of
spin-up and spin-down channels and a resulting magnetization. We estimate this
magnetization on the example of the lowest infrared active mode in the
perovskite KTaO$_3$. Our results show an electronic magnetic moment of $\approx
0.2$ $\mu_B$ per unit cell, depending on the doping level and electron
temperature.

<br>
<i>Dmytro Tarasevych, Andreas Rckriegel, Savio Keupert, Vasilios Mitsiioannou, Peter Kopietz</i>
<br>
<br>
We use our recently developed functional renormalization group (FRG) approach
for quantum spin systems to investigate the phase diagram of the frustrated
$J_{1}J_{2}J_{3}$ quantum Heisenberg model on a cubic lattice. From a simple
truncation of the hierarchy of FRG flow equations for the irreducible
spin-vertices which retains only static spin fluctuations and neglects the flow
of the four-spin interaction, we can estimate the critical temperature with a
similar accuracy as the numerically more expensive pseudofermion FRG. In the
regime where the ground state exhibits either ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic order, a more sophisticated truncation including the
renormalization of the four-spin interaction as well as dynamic spin
fluctuations reveals the underlying renormalization group fixed point and
yields critical temperatures which deviate from the accepted values by at most
4%.
