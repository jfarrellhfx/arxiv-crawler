<h3>Fabrication of optically smooth Sn thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19826" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19826</a>
<br>
<i>Vamsi Borra, Daniel G. Georgiev, Corey R. Grice</i>
<br>
<br>
The fabrication of optically smooth thin Sn films by vacuum or
electrodeposition techniques is usually challenging. Little has been published
on how to address this challenge mainly because very few applications require
such smooth Sn surfaces. The excitation of surface plasmon polaritons on Sn
surfaces by prism-based methods represents a case that requires very smooth
surfaces and has motivated this work. It is shown that the deposition rate and
the substrate temperature of a vacuum evaporation method can be optimized to
obtain very smooth Sn films and this is supported by direct imaging evidence
from atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.

<h3>Sn whisker growth mitigation by using NiO sublayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19827" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19827</a>
<br>
<i>Vamsi Borra, Srikanth Itapu, Daniel G. Georgiev</i>
<br>
<br>
The potential of NiO sublayers for whisker growth mitigation has been
examined. A thin NiO film was applied on a Cu-coated substrate before the
deposition of a thicker Sn layer. The growth of Sn whiskers was then followed
by optical and scanning electron microscopy and was compared with the whisker
growth on a control sample without the NiO sublayer. No whiskers were observed
on the sample with the NiO layer even after 12 months, whereas the control
sample developed whiskers of size and density that is generally expected, based
on the vast amount of published work on the topic. The mechanisms of whisker
growth and whisker growth suppression are briefly discussed as well.

<h3>Metal whisker growth induced by localized, high-intensity DC electric  fields</h3>

<br>
<i>Vamsi Borra, Osama Oudat, Daniel G. Georgiev, Victor G. Karpov, Diana Shvydka</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, a very high, locally applied electric field was used to induce
whisker nucleation on an Sn film. The field was generated by using a conductive
AFM tip and applying a voltage bias between the sample and the conductive
cantilever>The tip-sample separation distance was thus controllable, and any
dielectric breakdown could be avoided. At locations where the AFM tip was
positioned for an extended period, minuscule whiskers were observed, whose
growth direction matched vertical orientation of the field.

<h3>Tight-binding theory of spin-spin interactions, Curie temperatures, and  quantum Hall effects in topological (Hg,Cr)Te in comparison to  non-topological (Zn,Cr)Te, and (Ga,Mn)N</h3>

Earlier theoretical results on $p$-$d$ and $d$-$d$ exchange interactions for
zinc-blende semiconductors with Cr$^{2{+}}$ and Mn$^{3{+}}$ ions are revisited
and extended by including contributions beyond the dominating ferromagnetic
(FM) superexchange term [i.e., the interband Bloembergen-Rowland-Van Vleck
contribution and antiferromagnetic (AFM) two-electron term], and applied to
topological Cr-doped HgTe and non-topological (Zn,Cr)Te and (Ga,Mn)N in
zinc-blende and wurtzite crystallographic structures. From the obtained values
of the $d$-$d$ exchange integrals $J_{ij}$, and by combining the Monte-Carlo
simulations with the percolation theory for randomly distributed magnetic ions,
we determine magnitudes of Curie temperatures $T_{\text{C}}(x)$ for
$\mathrm{Zn}_{1-x}\mathrm{Cr}_x\mathrm{Te}$ and
$\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\mathrm{Mn}_x\mathrm{N}$ and compare to available
experimental data. Furthermore, we find that competition between FM and AFM
$d$-$d$ interactions can lead to a spin-glass phase in the case of
$\mathrm{Hg}_{1-x}\mathrm{Cr}_x\mathrm{Te}$. This competition, along with a
relatively large magnitude of the AF $p$-$d$ exchange energy $N_0\beta$ can
stabilize the quantum spin Hall effect, but may require the application of a
tilted magnetic field to observe the quantum anomalous Hall effect in HgTe
quantum wells doped with Cr.

<h3>Universal Correlations as Fingerprints of Transverse Quantum Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19875" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19875</a>
<br>
<i>Anatoly Kuklov, Lode Pollet, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Leo Radzihovsky, Boris Svistunov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study universal off-diagonal correlations in transverse quantum fluids
(TQF) -- a new class of quasi-one-dimensional superfluids featuring
long-range-ordered ground states. These exhibit unique self-similar space-time
relations scaling with $x^2/D\tau$ that serve as fingerprints of the specific
states. The results obtained with the effective field theory are found to be in
perfect agreement with {\it ab initio} simulations of hard-core bosons on a
lattice -- a simple microscopic realization of TQF. This allows an accurate
determination -- at nonzero temperature and finite system size -- of such key
ground-state properties as the condensate and superfluid densities, and
characteristic parameter $D$.

<h3>Connecting the avoided quantum critical point to the magic-angle  transition in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19876" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19876</a>
<br>
<i>J. H. Pixley, David A. Huse, Justin H. Wilson</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the interplay of short-ranged random and quasiperiodic
static potentials on the low-energy properties of three-dimensional Weyl
semimetals. This setting allows us to investigate the connection between the
semimetal to diffusive metal "magic-angle" phase transition due to
quasiperiodicity and the rare-region induced crossover at an avoided quantum
critical point (AQCP) due to disorder. We show that in the presence of both
random and quasiperiodic potentials the AQCP becomes lines of crossovers, which
terminate at magic-angle critical points in the quasiperiodic, disorder-free
limit. We analyze the magic-angle transition by approaching it along these
lines of avoided transitions, which unveils a rich miniband structure and
several AQCPs. These effects can be witnessed in cold-atomic experiments
through potential engineering on semimetallic band structures.

<h3>Magnetotransport in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric and Weyl  metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19877</a>
<br>
<i>Gautham Varma K, Azaz Ahmad, Sumanta Tewari, G. Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, chiral anomaly (CA) has been proposed to occur in spin-orbit
coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs), motivating CA to be a Fermi
surface property rather than a Weyl node property. Although the nature of the
anomaly is similar in both SOC-NCMs and Weyl systems, here we point out
significant fundamental differences between the two. We show that the different
nature of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) in the two systems leads to
non-trivial consequences -- particularly the sign of the longitudinal
magnetoconductance always remains positive in a SOC non-centrosymmetric metal,
unlike a Weyl metal that displays either sign. Furthermore,we investigate the
planar Hall effect and the geometrical contribution to the Hall effect in the
two systems and point out significant differences in the two systems. We
conduct our analysis for magnetic and non-magnetic impurities, making our study
important in light of current and upcoming experiments in both SOC-NCMs and
Weyl metals.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of the 3D Ising Transition on the Fuzzy  Sphere</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19880</a>
<br>
<i>Johannes S. Hofmann, Florian Goth, Wei Zhu, Yin-Chen He, Emilie Huffman</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating the 3D
phase transition on the recently proposed fuzzy sphere [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009
(2023)]. By introducing an additional $SU(2)$ layer degree of freedom, we
reformulate the model into a form suitable for sign-problem-free QMC
simulation. From the finite-size-scaling, we show that this QMC-friendly model
undergoes a quantum phase transition belonging to the 3D Ising universality
class, and at the critical point we compute the scaling dimensions from the
state-operator correspondence, which largely agrees with the prediction from
the conformal field theory. These results pave the way to construct
sign-problem-free models for QMC simulations on the fuzzy sphere, which could
advance the future study on more sophisticated criticalities.

<h3>Electrical Tuning of Neutral and Charged Excitons with 1-nm Gate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19895</a>

<br>
<br>
Electrical control of individual spins and photons in solids is key for
quantum technologies, but scaling down to small, static systems remains
challenging. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale electrical tuning of neutral and
charged excitons in monolayer WSe2 using 1-nm carbon nanotube gates.
Electrostatic simulations reveal a confinement radius below 15 nm, reaching the
exciton Bohr radius limit for few-layer dielectric spacing. In situ
photoluminescence spectroscopy shows gate-controlled conversion between neutral
excitons, negatively charged trions, and biexcitons at 4 K. Important for
quantum information processing applications, our measurements indicate gating
of a local 2D electron gas in the WSe2 layer, coupled to photons via trion
transitions with binding energies exceeding 20 meV. The ability to
deterministically tune and address quantum emitters using nanoscale gates
provides a pathway towards large-scale quantum optoelectronic circuits and
spin-photon interfaces for quantum networking.

<h3>Free fermions with no Jordan-Wigner transformation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19897" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19897</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Fendley, Balazs Pozsgay</i>
<br>
<br>
The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum
spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is
bilinear in fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum follows
from the eigenvalues of a matrix typically growing only linearly with the size
of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a Jordan-Wigner
transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of free-fermion
spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models can be found
exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising and lowering
operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of such spin
chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant graph-theory
construction to our model. We also explain how this family admits an $N$=2
lattice supersymmetry.

<h3>Quantum to classical crossover in generalized spin systems -- the  temperature-dependent spin dynamics of FeI$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19905" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19905</a>
<br>
<i>D. Dahlbom, D. Brooks, M. S. Wilson, S. Chi, A. I. Kolesnikov, M. B. Stone, H. Cao, Y.-W. Li, K. Barros, M. Mourigal, C. D. Batista, X. Bai</i>
<br>
<br>
Simulating quantum spin systems at finite temperatures is an open challenge
in many-body physics. This work studies the temperature-dependent spin dynamics
of a pivotal compound, FeI$_2$, to determine if universal quantum effects can
be accounted for by a phenomenological renormalization of the dynamical spin
structure factor $S(\mathbf{q}, \omega)$ measured by inelastic neutron
scattering. Renormalization schemes based on the quantum-to-classical
correspondence principle are commonly applied at low temperatures to the
harmonic oscillators describing normal modes. However, it is not clear how to
extend this renormalization to arbitrarily high temperatures. Here we introduce
a temperature-dependent normalization of the classical moments, whose magnitude
is determined by imposing the quantum sum rule, i.e. $\int d\omega d\mathbf{q}
S(\mathbf{q}, \omega) = N_S S (S+1)$ for $N_S$ dipolar magnetic moments. We
show that this simple renormalization scheme significantly improves the
agreement between the calculated and measured $S(\mathbf{q}, \omega)$ for
FeI$_{2}$ at all temperatures. Due to the coupled dynamics of dipolar and
quadrupolar moments in that material, this renormalization procedure is
extended to classical theories based on SU(3) coherent states, and by
extension, to any SU(N) coherent state representation of local multipolar
moments.

<h3>Pair-density wave signature observed by x-ray scattering in La-based  high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19907" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19907</a>
<br>
<i>Jun-Sik Lee, Steven A. Kivelson, Tong Wang, Yoichi Ikeda, Takanori Taniguchi, Masaki Fujita, Chi-Chang Kao</i>
<br>
<br>
Suggestive, but indirect evidence of the existence of pair-density wave (PDW)
order in several high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates has been reported. As this
constitutes a new quantum phase of matter, it is important to {\it establish}
its existence at least somewhere in the phase diagram. However, a direct
correspondence between experiment and theory has remained elusive. Here, we
report the observation of a theoretically predicted PDW {\it bulk} signature in
two La-based cuprates, Sr-doped La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ and Fe-doped
La$_{1.87}$Sr$_{0.13}$CuO$_4$, through a comprehensive study that incorporates
zero-magnetic field x-ray scattering, neutron scattering, and transport
measurements. Specifically, we observe the emergence of so-called "1Q" order,
which is to say subharmonic order associated with the charge-density wave (CDW)
stripes, in a range of temperatures in which independent evidence suggests the
co-existence of PDW long-range order and fluctuating uniform superconducting
order. The subharmonic order is most pronounced around a half-integer
$l$-vector, where the CDW diffraction peak is also strongest. This is
consistent with the theoretical proposal that the cancellation of the Josephson
coupling ("layer-decoupling"), is a signature of PDW order and that it is
commensurately locked to the density wave stripes that are known to alternate
orientation between adjacent layers. Even if the PDW is not the "mother of all
state", it is at least a close relative -- possibly a second cousin.

<h3>Stochastic resetting with refractory periods: pathway formulation and  exact results</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19913</a>
<br>
<i>Gregorio GarcÃ­a-Valladares, Deepak Gupta, Antonio Prados, Carlos A. Plata</i>
<br>
<br>
We look into the problem of stochastic resetting with refractory periods. The
model dynamics comprises diffusive and motionless phases. The diffusive phase
ends at random time instants, at which the system is reset to a given position
-- where the system remains at rest for a random time interval, termed the
refractory period. A pathway formulation is introduced to derive exact
analytical results for the relevant observables in a broad framework, with the
resetting time and the refractory period following arbitrary distributions. For
the paradigmatic case of Poissonian distributions of the resetting and
refractory times, in general with different characteristic rates, results are
obtained in closed-form. Finally, we focus on the single-target search problem,
in which the survival probability and the mean first passage time to the target
can be exactly computed. Therein, we also discuss optimal strategies, which
show a non-trivial dependence on the refractory period.

<h3>Non-bosonic moirÃ© excitons</h3>

<br>
<i>Tsung-Sheng Huang, Peter Lunts, Mohammad Hafezi</i>
<br>
<br>
Optical excitations in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers lead
to the creation of excitons, as electron-hole bound states, that are
generically considered within a Bose-Hubbard framework. Here, we demonstrate
that these composite particles obey an angular momentum commutation relation
that is generally non-bosonic. This emergent spin description of excitons
indicates a limitation to their occupancy on each site, which is substantial in
the weak electron-hole binding regime. The effective exciton theory is
accordingly a spin Hamiltonian, which further becomes a Hubbard model of
emergent bosons subject to an occupancy constraint after a Holstein-Primakoff
transformation. We apply our theory to three commonly studied bilayers
(MoSe2/WSe2, WSe2/WS2, and WSe2/MoS2) and show that in the relevant parameter
regimes their allowed occupancies never exceed three excitons. Our systematic
theory provides guidelines for future research on the many-body physics of
moir\'e excitons.

<h3>Dynamic, viscoelasticity-driven shape change of elastomer bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19954</a>
<br>
<i>Wenya Shu, C. Nadir Kaplan, Justin R. Barone</i>
<br>
<br>
Thin bilayers made of elastic sheets with different strain recoveries can be
used for dynamic shape morphing through ambient stimuli, such as temperature,
mass diffusion, and light. As a fundamentally different approach to designing
temporal shape change, constituent polymer molecular features (rather than
external fields) are leveraged, specifically the viscoelasticity of gelatin
bilayers, to achieve dynamic three-dimensional (3D) curls and helical twists.
After stretching and releasing, the acquired 3D shape recovers its original
flat shape on a timescale originating from the polymer viscoelasticity. The
bilayer time-dependent curvature can be accurately predicted from hyperelastic
and viscoelastic functions using finite element analysis (FEA). FEA reveals the
nonlinear shape dynamics in space and time in quantitative agreement with
experiments. The findings present a new frontier in dynamic biomimetic
shape-morphing by exploiting intrinsic material properties in contrast with
state-of-the-art methods relying on external field variations, moving one step
closer to acquiring autonomous shape-shifting capabilities of biological
systems.

<h3>Influence of Electrode Structuring Techniques on the Performance of  All-Solid-State Batteries</h3>

All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) offer a promising route to safer batteries
with superior energy density compared to conventional Li-ion batteries (LIBs).
However, the design of the composite cathode and optimization of the underlying
microstructure is one of the aspects requiring intensive research. Achieving
both high energy and power density remains challenging due to limitations in
ionic conductivity and active material loading. Using structure-resolved
simulations, we investigate the potential of perforated and layered electrode
designs to enhance ASSB performance. Design strategies showing significant
performance increase in LIBs are evaluated regarding their application to
ASSBs. Composite cathodes with solid electrolyte channels in the structure do
not significantly increase cell performance compared to unstructured
electrodes. However, the design with a two-layer cathode proves promising. The
layered structure effectively balances improved ionic transport due to
increased solid electrolyte fraction at the separator side and substantial
active material loading through increased active material fraction at the
current collector side of the cathode. Our research highlights key challenges
in ASSB development and provides a clear direction for future studies in the
field.

<h3>Connection between partial pressure, volatility, and the Soret effect  elucidated using simulations of non-ideal liquid mixtures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20005" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20005</a>
<br>
<i>Brandon Fields, Patrick K. Schelling</i>
<br>
<br>
Building on recent simulation work, it is demonstrated using
molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of two-component liquid mixtures that the
chemical contribution to the Soret effect in two-component non-ideal fluid
mixtures arises due to differences in how the partial pressures of the
components respond to temperature and density gradients. Further insight is
obtained by reviewing the connection between activity and deviations from
Raoult's law in the measurement of the vapor pressure of a liquid mixture. A
new parameter gamma, defined in a manner similar to the activity coefficient,
is used to characterize differences deviations from ``ideal'' behavior. It is
then shown that the difference gamma2-gamma1 is predictive of the sign of the
Soret coefficient and is correlated to its magnitude. We hence connect the
Soret effect to the relative volatility of the components of a liquid mixture,
with the more volatile component enriched in the low-density, high-temperature
region, and the less volatile component enriched in the high-density,
low-temperature region. Because gamma is closely connected to the activity
coefficient, this suggests the possibility that measurement of partial vapor
pressures might be used to indirectly determine the Soret coefficient. It is
proposed that the insight obtained here is quite general and should be
applicable to a wide range of materials systems. An attempt is made to
understand how these results might apply to other materials systems including
interstitials in solids and multicomponent solids with interdiffusion occurring
via a vacancy mechanism.

<h3>Active-parameter polydispersity in the 2d ABP Yukawa model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20015</a>
<br>
<i>Shibu Saw, Lorenzo Costigliola, Jeppe C. Dyre</i>
<br>
<br>
The most commonly studied kind of parameter polydispersity is that of varying
particles size. This paper investigates by simulations the effects of
introducing polydispersity in other parameters of the two-dimensional Active
Brownian Particles model with Yukawa pair interactions. Polydispersity is
introduced separately in the translational and rotational diffusion
coefficients, as well as in the persistence speed $v_0$. Uniform and binary
parameter distributions are considered in both the homogeneous and the
motility-induced phase-separation (MIPS) phases. We find only minute changes in
the structure and dynamics upon the introduction of parameter polydispersity,
even for situations involving up to 50% polydispersity. The reason for this is
not clear. An exception is the case of $v_0$ polydispersity for which the
average radial distribution function shows significant changes in the MIPS
phase with increasing polydispersity. Even in this case, however, the dynamics
is only modestly affected. As a possible application of these findings, we
suggest that the temporal introduction of polydispersity into single-component
active-matter models characterized by a very long equilibration time, i.e., a
glass-forming active system, may be used to equilibrate the system efficiently
by particle swaps.

Understanding the exotic properties of quantum materials, including
high-temperature superconductors, remains a formidable challenge that demands
direct insights into electronic conductivity. Current methodologies either
capture a bulk average or near-atomically-resolved information, missing direct
measurements at the critical intermediate length scales. Here, using the
superconductor Fe(Se,Te) as a model system, we use low-temperature conductive
atomic force microscopy (cAFM) to bridge this gap. Contrary to the uniform
superconductivity anticipated from bulk assessments, cAFM uncovers micron-scale
conductive intrusions within a relatively insulating matrix. Subsequent
compositional mapping through atom probe tomography, shows that differences in
conductivity correlated with local changes in composition. cAFM, supported by
advanced microscopy and microanalysis, represents a methodological breakthrough
that can be used to navigate the intricate landscape of high-temperature
superconductors and the broader realm of quantum materials. Such fundamental
information is critical for theoretical understanding and future guided design.

<h3>Merging Dipolar Supersolids in a Double-Well Potential</h3>

<br>
<i>Hui Li, Eli Halperin, Shai Ronen, John L. Bohn</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the merging behaviour of two identical
supersolids through dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates confined within a
double-well potential. By adiabatically tuning the barrier height and the
spacing between the two wells for specific trap aspect ratios, the two
supersolids move toward each other and lead to the emergence of a variety of
ground state phases, including a supersolid state, a macrodroplet state, a ring
state, and a labyrinth state. We construct a phase diagram that characterizes
various states seen during the merging transition. Further, we calculate the
force required to pull the two portions of the gas apart, finding that the
merged supersolids act like a deformable plastic material. Our work paves the
way for future studies of layer structure in dipolar supersolids and the
interaction between them in experiments.

<h3>Schwinger mechanism of magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic  field inhomogeneities and the bosonic Klein effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20035</a>

<i>T. C. Adorno, S. P. Gavrilov, D. M. Gitman</i>
<br>
<br>
Effective field theory of low-energy exitations-magnons that describes
antiferromagnets is mapped into scalar electrodynamics of a charged scalar
field interacting with an external electromagnetic potential. In the presence
of a constant inhomogeneous external magnetic field the latter problem is
technically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation from the vacuum
by an electric potential step (x-step). Magnetic moment plays here the role of
the electric charge, and magnons and antimagnons differ from each other in the
sign of the magnetic moment. In the framework of such a consideration, it is
important to take into account the vacuum instability (the Schwinger effect)
under the magnon-antimagnon production on magnetic field inhomogeneities (an
analog of pair creation from the vacuum by electric-like fields). We
demonstrate how to use the strong field QED with x-steps developed by the
authors (SPG and DMG) to study the magnon-antimagnon pair production on
magnetic field inhomogeneities. Characteristics of the vacuum instability
obtained for some magnetic steps that allows exact solving the Klein-Gordon
equation are presented. In particular, we consider examples of magnetic steps
with very sharp field derivatives that correspond to a regularization of the
Klein step. In the case of smooth-gradient steps, we describe an universal
behavior of the flux density of created magnon pairs. We also note that since
the low-energy magnons are bosons with small effective mass, then for the first
time maybe the opportunity will arise to observe the Schwinger effect in the
case of the Bose statistics, in particular, the bosonic Klein effect in
laboratory conditions. Moreover, it turns out that in the case of the Bose
statistics appears a new mechanism for amplifying the effect of the pair
creation, which we call statistically-assisted Schwinger effect.

We show that Rashba spin-orbit coupling modifies electron-electron
interaction vertex leading to a number of novel phenomena. First, the
spin-orbit-modified Coulomb interactions induce p-wave superconducting order,
without any other mediators of attraction. Second, a sufficiently strong
spin-orbit coupling results in a ferromagnetic order, associated with a
Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface. Such
topology-changing transition leads to distinct experimentally observable
consequences. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, the
ferromagnetism may coexist with the p-wave superconductivity.

<br>

We describe a first-principles statistical mechanics method to calculate the
free energies of crystalline alloys that depend on temperature, composition,
and strain. The approach relies on an extension of the alloy cluster expansion
to include an explicit dependence on homogeneous strain in addition to site
occupation variables that track the degree of chemical ordering. The method is
applied to the Si-Ge binary alloy and is used to calculate free energies that
describe phase stability under arbitrary epitaxial constraints. We find that
while the incoherent phase diagram (in which coexisting phases are not affected
by coherency constraints) hosts a miscibility gap, coherent phase equilibrium
predicts ordering and negative enthalpies of mixing. Instead of chemical
instability, the chemo-mechanical free energy exhibits instabilities along
directions that couple the composition of the alloy with a volumetric strain
order parameter. This has fundamental implications for phase field models of
spinodal decomposition as it indicates the importance of gradient energy
coefficients that couple gradients in composition with gradients in strain.

<br>
My model, it has three layers, Three layers is nematic. And had it just two
layers, it would be a smectic.
We study a reduced model of the smectic transition in two dimensions where
the particles occupy three equally spaced layers. The role of particle geometry
comes in through the interactions between particles on the central layer and
those above and below. The system is understood to be smectic when the central
layer is empty, and nematic when all three are equally occupied. It is possible
to compute the free energies of these states exactly. We find that the free
energy of the nematic can only exceed that of the smectic if the particle tips
are sufficiently wide, mirroring the fact that ellipsoids do not make a smectic
but sphero-cylinders do.

<h3>Rectification of Random Walkers Induced by Energy Flow at Boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20115" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20115</a>
<br>
<i>Vidyesh Rao Anisetti, Sharath Ananthamurthy, J. M. Schwarz</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore rectification phenomena in a system where two-dimensional random
walkers interact with a funnel-shaped ratchet under two distinct classes of
reflection rules. The two classes include the angle of reflection exceeding the
angle of incidence ($\theta_{reflect} > \theta_{incident}$), or vice versa
($\theta_{reflect} < \theta_{incident}$). These generalized boundary reflection
rules are indicative of non-equilibrium conditions due to the introduction of
energy flows at the boundary. Our findings reveal that the nature of such
particle-wall interactions dictates the system's behavior: the funnel either
acts as a pump, directing flow, or as a collector, demonstrating a ratchet
reversal. Importantly, we provide a geometric proof elucidating the underlying
mechanism of rectification, thereby offering insights into why certain
interactions lead to directed motion, while others do not.

In the field of correlated electron materials, the relation between the
resonating spin singlet and antiferromagnetic states has long been an
attractive topic for understanding of the interesting macroscopic quantum
phenomena, such as the ones emerging from magnetic frustrated materials,
antiferromagnets and high-temperature superconductors. SrCu2(BO3)2 is a
well-known quantum magnet, and it is theoretically expected to be the candidate
of correlated electron material for clarifying the existence of a
pressure-induced deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), featured by a
continuous quantum phase transition, between the plaquette-singlet (PS) valence
bond solid phase and the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. However, the real nature
of the transition is yet to be identified experimentally due to the technical
challenge. Here we show the experimental results for the first time, through
the state-of-the-art high-pressure heat capacity measurement, that the PS-AF
phase transition of the pressurized SrCu2(BO3)2 at zero field is clearly a
first-order one. Our result clarifies the more than two-decade long debates
about this key issue, and resonates nicely with the recent quantum entanglement
understanding that the theoretically predicted DQCPs in representative lattice
models are actually a first-order transition. Intriguingly, we also find that
the transition temperatures of the PS and AF phase meet at the same
pressure-temperature point, which signifies a bi-critical point as those
observed in Fe-based superconductor and heavy-fermion compound, and constitutes
the first experimental discovery of the pressure-induced bi-critical point in
frustrated magnets. Our results provide fresh information for understanding the
evolution among different spin states of correlated electron materials under
pressure.

<h3>Rashba spin splitting based on trilayer graphene systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20136" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20136</a>
<br>
<i>Xinjuan Cheng, Liangyao Xiao, Xuechao Zhai</i>
<br>
<br>
We establish a general Rashba Hamiltonian for trilayer graphene (TLG) by
introducing an extrinsic layer-dependent Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
arising from the off-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Our results indicate
that the band spin splitting depends strongly on the layer-distribution and
sign of Rashba SOC as well as the ABA or ABC stacking order of TLG. We find
that spin splitting is significantly enhanced as the number of layers of the
Rashba SOC with the same sign and magnitude increases. For the
spatially-separated two Rashba SOCs of the same magnitude but the opposite
sign, no spin splitting arises in ABC-TLG due to the preservation of inversion
symmetry that ensures the complete cancellation of contributions from the
opposite layers, whereas nonzero spin splitting is observed for ABA-TLG due to
its own lack of inversion symmetry. We further illustrate that gate voltage is
effective to modulate the spin-polarized states near the band edges. Moreover,
we use density functional theory calculations to verify the Rashba splitting
effect in the example of TLG interfaced by Au layer(s), which induce
simultaneously the effective terms of Rashba SOC and gate voltage. Our results
demonstrate the significance of layer and symmetry in manipulating spin and can
be extended to multilayer graphene or other van der Waals interface systems.

<h3>Tunnel Valley Current Filter in the Partially Overlapped Graphene under  the Vertical Electric Field</h3>

<br>
The tunnel current (TC) and valley current (VC) are crucial in realizing
high-speed and energy-saving in next-generation devices. This paper presents
the TC and VC link in the partially overlapped graphene. Under the vertical
electric field, the two graphene layers have the opposite AB sublattice
symmetry, followed by a block on the intravalley transmission. In the allowed
intervalley transmission, the difference in the phase of the decay factor
prefers only one of the valleys in the output according to the overlapped
length. These results suggest that the band gap with no edge state is a new
platform of valleytronics.

<h3>Highly Anisotropic Elastic Properties of Suspended Black Arsenic  Nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<br>
Anisotropy, as an exotic degree of freedom, enables us to discover the
emergent two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials with low in-plane symmetry
and to explore their outstanding properties and promising applications. 2D
black arsenic (b-As) with puckered structure has garnered increasing attention
these years owing to its extreme anisotropy with respect to the electrical,
thermal, and optical properties. However, the investigation on mechanical
properties of 2D b-As is still lacking, despite much effort on theoretical
simulations. Herein, we report the highly anisotropic elastic properties of
suspended b-As nanoribbons via atomic force microscope-based nanoindentation.
It was found that the extracted Young's modulus of b-As nanoribbons exhibits
remarkable anisotropy, which approximates to 72.2 +- 5.4 and 44.3 +- 1.4 GPa
along zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. The anisotropic ratio
reaches up to ~ 1.6. We expect that these results could lay a solid foundation
for the potential applications of 2D anisotropic nanomaterials in the
next-generation nanomechanics and optoelectronics.

<br>
Polaritonic lattice configurations in dimensions $D=2$ are used as simulators
of topological phases, based on symmetry class A Hamiltonians. Numerical and
topological studies are performed in order to characterise the bulk topology of
insulating phases, which is predicted to be connected to non-trivial edge mode
states on the boundary. By using spectral flattened Hamiltonians on specific
lattice geometries with time reversal symmetry breaking, e.g. Kagome lattice,
we obtain maps from the Brillouin zone into Grassmannian spaces, which are
further investigated by the topological method of space fibrations. Numerical
evidence reveals a connection between the sum of valence band Chern numbers and
the index of the projection operator onto the valence band states. Along these
lines, we discover an index formula which resembles other index theorems and
the classical result of Atiyah-Singer, but without any Dirac operator and from
a different perspective. Through a combination of different tools, in
particular homotopy and homology-cohomology duality, we provide a comprehensive
mathematical framework, which fully addresses the source and structure of
topological phases in coupled polaritonic array systems. Based on these
results, it becomes possible to infer further designs and models of
two-dimensional single sheet Chern insulators, implemented as polariton
simulators.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered magnets, such as iron chalcogenides, have
emerged these years as a new family of unconventional superconductor and
provided the key insights to understand the phonon-electron interaction and
pairing mechanism. Their mechanical properties are of strategic importance for
the potential applications in spintronics and optoelectronics. However, there
is still lack of efficient approach to tune the elastic modulus despite the
extensive studies. Herein, we report the modulated elastic modulus of 2D
magnetic FeTe and its thickness-dependence via phase engineering. The grown 2D
FeTe by chemical vapor deposition can present various polymorphs, i.e.
tetragonal FeTe (t-FeTe, antiferromagnetic) and hexagonal FeTe (h-FeTe,
ferromagnetic). The measured Young's modulus of t-FeTe by nanoindentation
method showed an obvious thickness-dependence, from 290.9+-9.2 to 113.0+-8.7
GPa when the thicknesses increased from 13.2 to 42.5 nm, respectively. In
comparison, the elastic modulus of h-FeTe remains unchanged. Our results could
shed light on the efficient modulation of mechanical properties of 2D magnetic
materials and pave the avenues for their practical applications in nanodevices.

<h3>Enhanced dendrite nucleation and Li-clustering at vacancies on graphene</h3>

<i>Jonathon Cottom, Qiong Cai, Emilia Olsson</i>
<br>
<br>
An ever present challenge for Li-ion batteries is the formation of metallic
dendrites on cycling that dramatically reduces cycle life and leads to the
untimely failure of the cell. In this work we investigate the modes of
Li-cluster formation on pristine and defective graphene. Firstly, we
demonstrate that on a defect free surface the cluster formation is impeded by
the thermodynamic instability of \ce{Li_2} and \ce{Li_3} clusters. In contrast,
the presence of a vacancy dramatically favours clustering. This provides
insights into the two modes of Li-growth observed: for the pristine basal plane
if the Li-Li repulsion of the small clusters can be overcome then plating type
behaviour would be predicted (rate / voltage dependent and at any point on the
surface); whilst dendritic growth would be predicted to nucleate from vacancy
sites, either pre-existing in the material or formed as a result of processing.

<br>
<br>
We develop a transferable machine learning model which predicts structural
relaxation from amorphous supercooled liquid structures. The trained networks
are able to predict dynamic heterogeneity across a broad range of temperatures
and time scales with excellent accuracy and transferability. We use the network
transferability to predict dynamic heterogeneity down to the experimental glass
transition temperature, $T_g$, where structural relaxation cannot be analyzed
using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that the strength,
the geometry and the characteristic length scale of the dynamic heterogeneity
evolve much more slowly near $T_g$ compared to their evolution at higher
temperatures. Our results show that machine learning techniques can provide
physical insights on the nature of the glass transition that cannot be gained
using conventional simulation techniques.

Our understanding of three basic states of matter (solids, liquids and gases)
is based on temperature and pressure phase diagrams with three phase transition
lines: solid-gas, liquid-gas and solid-liquid lines. There are analytical
expressions P(T) for the first two lines derived on purely general-theoretical
thermodynamic basis. In contrast, there exists no similar function for the
third, melting, line (ML). Here, we show a general-theoretical derivation of
the differential equation for the ML. The solution is in agreement with
experimental MLs of different system types.

We study statistical properties of matrix elements entering the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis by studying the observables written in the energy
eigenbasis of generic quantum systems and truncated to small microcanonical
windows. We put forward a picture, that below certain energy scale collective
statistical properties of matrix elements exhibit emergent unitary symmetry. In
particular, below this scale the spectrum of the microcanonically truncated
operator exhibits universal behavior for which we introduce readily testable
criteria. We support this picture by numerical simulations and demonstrate
existence of emergent unitary symmetry scale for all considered operators in
chaotic many-body quantum systems. We discuss operator and system-size
dependence of this energy scale and put our findings into context of previous
works exploring emergence of random-matrix behavior in narrow energy windows.

We determined the complex dielectric functions of $\varepsilon$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
using optical transmittance and reflectance spectroscopies at temperatures from
10 K to room temperature. The measured dielectric-function spectra reveal
distinct structures at a bandgap energy. We fitted a model dielectric function
based on the electronic energy-band structure to these experimental data. We
analyzed the temperature dependence of the band-gap with a model based on
phonon dispersion effects. One could explain it in terms of phonon-related
parameters such as the optical phonon temperature. We compare phonon-related
properties of $\varepsilon$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ with those of a large variety of
element and binary semiconductors.

We propose an exactly solvable lattice model, motivated by the significance
of the extended Hubbard model ($t-U-V$ model) and inspired by the work of
Hatsugai and Kohmoto. The ground state exhibits a diverse array of phases,
including the charge-$4e$ condensed phase, the charge-$2e$ superconducting
phase, the half-filled insulating phase, the quarter-filled insulating phase,
the metallic phase, and an unconventional metallic phase. Among them, the
unconventional metallic phase could be of particular significance, for the
coexistence of electrons and pairs at zero energy. These findings are poised to
advance our understanding and exploration of strongly correlated physics.

<h3>Emergent topological ordered phase for the Ising-XY Model revealed by  cluster-updating Monte-Carlo method</h3>

<br>
<i>Heyang Ma, Wanzhou Zhang, Chengxiang Ding, Youjin Deng</i>
<br>
<br>
The two-component cold atom systems with anisotropic hopping amplitudes can
be phenomenologically described by a two-dimensional Ising-XY coupled model
with spatial anisotropy. At low temperatures, theoretical predictions [Phys.
Rev. A 72, 053604 (2005)] and [arXiv:0706.1609] indicate the existence of a
topological ordered phase characterized by Ising and XY disorder but with 2XY
ordering. However, due to ergodic difficulties faced by Monte Carlo methods at
low temperatures, this topological phase has not been numerically explored. We
propose a linear cluster updating Monte Carlo method, which flips spins without
rejection in the anisotropy limit but does not change the energy. Using this
scheme and conventional Monte Carlo methods, we succeed in revealing the nature
of topological phases with half-vortices and domain walls. In the constructed
global phase diagram, Ising and XY type transitions are very close to each
other and differ significantly from the schematic phase diagram reported
earlier. We also propose and explore a wide range of quantities, including
magnetism, superfluidity, specific heat, susceptibility, and even percolation
susceptibility, and obtain consistent results. Furthermore, we observe
first-order transitions characterized by common intersection points in
magnetizations for different system sizes, as opposed to the conventional phase
transition where Binder cumulants of various sizes share common intersections.
The results are useful to help cold atom experiments explore the half-vortex
topological phase.

<br>
<br>
We investigate phonon lifetimes in VO2 single crystals. We do so in the
metallic state above the metal-insulator transition (MIT), where strong
structural fluctuations are known to take place. By combining inelastic X-ray
scattering and Raman spectroscopy, we track the temperature dependence of
several acoustic and optical phonon modes up to 1000 K. Contrary to what is
commonly observed, we find that phonon lifetimes decrease with decreasing
temperature. Our results show that pre-transitional fluctuations in the
metallic state give rise to strong electron-phonon scattering that onsets
hundreds of degrees above the transition and increases as the MIT is
approached. Notably, this effect is not limited to specific points of
reciprocal space that could be associated with the structural transition.

Quantum oscillations originating from the quantization of the electron
cyclotron orbits provide ultrasensitive diagnostics of electron bands and
interactions in novel materials. We report on the first direct-space nanoscale
imaging of the thermodynamic magnetization oscillations due to the de Haas-van
Alphen effect in moir\'e graphene. Scanning by SQUID-on-tip in Bernal bilayer
graphene crystal-axis-aligned to hBN reveals abnormally large magnetization
oscillations with amplitudes reaching 500 {\mu}_B/electron in weak magnetic
fields, unexpectedly low frequencies, and high sensitivity to the superlattice
filling fraction. The oscillations allow us to reconstruct the complex band
structure in exquisite detail, revealing narrow moir\'e bands with multiple
overlapping Fermi surfaces separated by unusually small momentum gaps. We
identify distinct sets of oscillations that violate the textbook Onsager Fermi
surface sum rule, signaling formation of exotic broad-band particle-hole
superposition states induced by coherent magnetic breakdown.

<br>
Transition-metal honeycomb compounds are capturing scientific attention due
to their distinctive electronic configurations, underscored by the
triangular-lattice spin-orbit coupling and competition between multiple
interactions, paving the way for potential manifestations of phenomena such as
Dirac semimetal, superconductivity, and quantum spin liquid states. These
compounds can undergo discernible pressure-induced alterations in their
crystallographic and electronic paradigms, as exemplified by our high-pressure
(HP) synthesis and exploration of the honeycomb polymorph of ReO3 (P6322). This
HP-P6322 polymorph bears a phase transition from P6322 to P63/mmc upon cooling
around Tp = 250 K, as evidenced by the evolution of temperature-dependent
magnetization (M-T curves), cell dimension, and conductivity initiated by an
inherent bifurcation of the oxygen position in the ab plane. Insightful
analysis of its band structure positions suggests this HP-P6322 polymorph being
a plausible candidate for Dirac semimetal properties. This phase transition
evokes anomalies in the temperature-dependent variation of paramagnetism
(non-linearity) and a crossover from semiconductor to temperature-independent
metal, showing a temperature independent conductivity behavior below ~200 K.
Under increasing external pressure, both the Tp and resistance of this
HP-polymorph is slightly magnetic-field dependent and undergo a "V"-style
evolution (decreasing and then increasing) before becoming pressure independent
up to 20.2 GPa. Theoretical calculations pinpoint this anionic disorder as a
probable catalyst for the decrement in the conductive efficiency and muted
temperature-dependent conductivity response.

<br>
<br>
The fluctuation-dissipation relation for the classical definition of work is
extended to thermally isolated systems, in classical and quantum realms. From
this, the optimal work variance is calculated, showing it achieves its minimum
possible value, independent of the rate of the process, in a so-called
quasistatic variance, related to the difference between the quasistatic work
and the difference of Helmholtz's free energy of the system. The result is
corroborated by the example of the classical and driven harmonic oscillator,
whose probability density function of the work distribution is non-Gaussian and
constant for different rates. The optimal variance is calculated for the
quantum Ising chain as well, showing its finiteness if the linear response
validity criterion is complied with. A stronger definition of the arbitrary
constant for the relaxation function of thermally isolated systems is obtained
along the work.

Non-trivial electronic states are attracting intense attention in
low-dimensional physics. Though chirality has been identified in charge states
with a scalar order parameter, its intertwining with charge density waves
(CDW), film thickness and the impact on the electronic behaviors remain less
well understood. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy, we report a 2 x 2
chiral CDW as well as a strong suppression of the Te-5p hole-band
backscattering in monolayer 1T-TiTe2. These exotic characters vanish in bilayer
TiTe2 with a non-CDW state. Theoretical calculations approve that chirality
comes from a helical stacking of the triple-q CDW components and therefore can
persist at the two-dimensional limit. Furthermore, the chirality renders the
Te-5p bands an unconventional orbital texture that prohibits electron
backscattering. Our study establishes TiTe2 as a promising playground for
manipulating the chiral ground states at the monolayer limit and provides a
novel path to engineer electronic properties from an orbital degree.

<br>
<br>
When modeling microstructures, the computational resource requirements
increase rapidly as the simulation domain becomes larger. As a result,
simulating a small representative fraction under periodic boundary conditions
is often a necessary simplification. However, the truncated structures leave
nonphysical boundaries, which are detrimental to numerical modeling. Here, we
propose a self-stitching algorithm for generating periodic structures,
demonstrated in a grain structure. The main idea of our algorithm is to
artificially add structural information between mismatched boundary pairs,
using the hierarchical spatial predictions of the U-Net. The algorithm provides
an automatic and unbiased way to obtain periodic boundaries in grain structures
and can be applied to porous microstructures in a similar way.

We calculate the (restricted) free energy as a function of polarization for

constants in the range 0 < J2 < 1/2 at J1 = - 1, for which the ground state is
ferromagnetic (or N{\'e}el antiferromagnetic when J1 = 1). Within RLFA, a
metastable state with zero polarization is present in the ordered phase, which
was recently discussed by V.A. Abalmasov and B.E. Vugmeister, Phys. Rev. E 107,
034124 (2023). In addition, the free energy calculated within RLFA indicates a
geometric slab-droplet phase transition at low temperature, which cannot be
detected in the mean field approximation. In turn, exact calculations of the
free energy for the sample size L = 6 and MC simulations for L = 10 reveal
metastable states with a wide range of polarization values in the ordered
phase, the origin of which we discuss. The calculations also reveal additional
slab-droplet transitions (at J2 > 0.25). These findings enrich our knowledge of
the J1-J2 Ising model and the RLFA as a useful theoretical tool to study phase
transitions in spin systems.

Recently, canted antiferromagnets offer great potential for fundamental
research and applications due to their unique properties. The presence of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to the existence of a weak
ferromagnetic moment at room temperature. We study both theoretically and
experimentally microwave spin pumping by the quasi-ferromagnetic mode from a
canted easy plane antiferromagnet with weak ferromagnetism FeBO3. The
conversion of a microwave signal into the constant voltage is realized using
the inverse spin Hall effect in an iron borate/heavy metal heterostructure. We
use an additional bias magnetic field to selectively tune the resonance
frequency of such a microwave detector over a wide range up to 43.5 GHz with
potential sensitivity near 2.5 microV/W. We confirm the pure spin current
nature by changing polarity of the detected via inverse spin Hall effect
voltage by switching the direction of the bias magnetic field. We believe that
our results will be useful for the development of highly tunable, portable and
sensitive microwave antiferromagnet-based functional devices.

Traditionally, increasing compositional complexity and chemical diversity of
high entropy alloy ceramics whilst maintaining a stable single-phase solid
solution has been a primary design strategy for the development of new
ceramics. However, only a handful have shown properties that justify the
increased alloying content. Here, we unveil a groundbreaking strategy based on
deviation from conventional equimolar composition towards non-equimolar
composition space, enabling tuning the metastability level of the
supersaturated single-phase solid solution. By employing high-temperature
micromechanical testing of refractory metal-based high entropy nitrides, we
found that the activation of an additional strengthening mechanism upon
metastable phase decomposition propels the yield strength of a non-equimolar
nitride at 1000 C to a staggering 6.9 GPa, that is 30 % higher than the most
robust equimolar nitride. We show that the inherent instability triggers the
decomposition of the solid solution with non-equimolar composition at high
temperatures, inducing strengthening due to the coherency stress of a
spinodally modulated structure, combined with the lattice resistance of the
product solid solution phase. In stark contrast, the strength of equimolar
systems, boasting diverse chemical compositions, declines as a function of
temperature due to the weakening of the lattice resistance and the absence of
other strengthening mechanisms.

<h3>Inducing Stratification of Colloidal Mixtures with a Mixed Binary  Solvent</h3>

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to demonstrate that a binary solvent
can be used to stratify colloidal mixtures when the suspension is rapidly
dried. The solvent consists of two components, one more volatile than the
other. When evaporated at high rates, the more volatile component becomes
depleted near the evaporation front and develops a negative concentration
gradient from the bulk of the mixture to the liquid-vapor interface while the
less volatile solvent is enriched in the same region and exhibit a positive
concentration gradient. Such gradients can be used to drive a binary mixture of
colloidal particles to stratify if one is preferentially attracted to the more
volatile solvent and the other to the less volatile solvent. During solvent
evaporation, the fraction of colloidal particles preferentially attracted to
the less volatile solvent is enhanced at the evaporation front, whereas the
colloidal particles having stronger attractions with the more volatile solvent
are driven away from the interfacial region. As a result, the colloidal
particles show a stratified distribution after drying, even if the two colloids
have the same size.

Spatiotemporal patterns in multicellular systems are important to
understanding tissue dynamics, for instance, during embryonic development and
disease. Here, we use a multiphase field model to study numerically the
behavior of a near-confluent monolayer of deformable cells with intercellular
friction. Varying friction and cell motility drives a solid-liquid transition,
and near the transition boundary, we find the emergence of nematic order of
cell deformation driven by shear-aligning cellular flows. Intercellular
friction endows the monolayer with a finite viscosity, which significantly
increases the spatial correlation in the flow and, concomitantly, the extent of
nematic order. We also show that hexatic and nematic order are tightly coupled
and propose a mechanical-geometric model for the colocalization of +1/2 nematic
defects and 5-7 disclination pairs, which are the structural defects in the
hexatic phase. Such topological defects coincide with regions of high cell-cell
overlap, suggesting that they may mediate cellular extrusion from the
monolayer, as found experimentally. Our results delineate a mechanical basis
for the recent observation of nematic and hexatic order in multicellular
collectives in experiments and simulations and pinpoint a generic pathway to
couple topological and physical effects in these systems.

<h3>Quantum DNA Sequencing using Gaussian Amplitude Amplification</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we explore how quantum pathfinding algorithm called Gaussian
Amplitude Amplification (GAA) can be used to solve the DNA sequencing problem.
To do this, sequencing by hybridization was assumed wherein short fragments of
the nucleic acids called oligonucleotides of length l were gathered and were
then assembled. The process of reassembling the sequence was then abstracted
into a graph problem of finding the Hamiltonian path with the least cost. The
constructed directed graph was then converted into sequential bipartite graphs
in order to use GAA. The results of our simulation revealed that for the case
where l = 2 and spectrum size of |S| = 4, the probability of finding the
optimal solution (with the least cost) is approximately 70.92% - a significant
improvement compared to 4.17% when the path is chosen randomly. While this
study only focused on the ideal scenario where there are no errors in the
spectrum, the outcomes presented here demonstrate the plausibility of using GAA
as a genome sequencing method.

Al$_x$Sc$_{1-x}$ thin films have been studied with compositions around
Al$_3$Sc ($x = 0.75$) for potential interconnect metallization applications.
As-deposited 25 nm films were x-ray amorphous but crystallized at 190{\deg}C
with a recrystallization observed at 440{\deg}C. After annealing at 500{\deg}C,
24 nm thick stoichiometric Al$_3$Sc showed a resistivity of 12.6
${\mu}{\Omega}$cm, limited by a combination of grain boundary and point defect
(disorder) scattering. Together with ab initio calculations that found a mean
free path of the charge carriers of 7 nm for stoichiometric Al$_3$Sc, these
results indicate that Al$_3$Sc bears promise for future interconnect
metallization schemes. Challenges remain in minimizing the formation of
secondary phases as well as in the control of the non-stoichiometric surface
oxidation and interfacial reaction with the underlying dielectrics.

<h3>Truncated stochastically switching processes</h3>

<br>
<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
There are a large variety of hybrid stochastic systems that couple a
continuous process with some form of stochastic switching mechanism. In many
cases the system switches between different discrete internal states according
to a finite-state Markov chain, and the continuous dynamics depends on the
current internal state. The resulting hybrid stochastic differential equation
(hSDE) could describe the evolution of a neuron's membrane potential, the
concentration of proteins synthesized by a gene network, or the position of an
active particle. Another major class of switching system is a search process
with stochastic resetting, where the position of a diffusing or active particle
is reset to a fixed position at a random sequence of times. In this case the
system switches between a search phase and a reset phase, where the latter may
be instantaneous. In this paper, we investigate how the behavior of a
stochastically switching system is modified when the maximum number of
switching (or reset) events in a given time interval is fixed. This is
motivated by the idea that each time the system switches there is an additive
energy cost. We first show that in the case of an hSDE, restricting the number
of switching events is equivalent to truncating a Volterra series expansion of
the particle propagator. Such a truncation significantly modifies the moments
of the resulting renormalized propagator. We then investigate how restricting
the number of reset events affects the diffusive search for an absorbing
target. In particular, truncating a Volterra series expansion of the survival
probability, we calculate the splitting probabilities and conditional MFPTs for
the particle to be absorbed by the target or to exceed a given number of
resets, respectively.

<h3>Hidden Real Topology and Unusual Magnetoelectric Responses in Monolayer  Antiferromagnetic Cr$_2$Se$_2$O</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20510</a>
<br>
<i>Jialin Gong, Yang Wang, Yilin Han, Zhenxiang Cheng, Xiaotian Wang, Zhi-Ming Yu, Yugui Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, the real topology has been attracting widespread interest in two
dimensions (2D). Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical
analysis, we reveal the monolayer Cr$_2$Se$_2$O (ML-CrSeO) as the first
material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator (RCI)
with topologically protected corner states. Unlike previous RCIs, we find that
the real topology of the ML-CrSeO is rooted in one certain mirror subsystem of
the two spin channels, and can not be directly obtained from all the valence
bands in each spin channel as commonly believed. In particular, due to
antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in ML-CrSeO exhibit strong
corner-contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin-corner coupling (SCC).
This SCC enables a direct connection between spin space and real space.
Consequently, large and switchable net magnetization can be induced in the
ML-CrSeO nanodisk by electrostatic means, such as potential step and in-plane
electric field, and the corresponding magnetoelectric responses behave like a
sign function, distinguished from that of the conventional multiferroic
materials. Our work considerably broadens the candidate range of RCI materials,
and opens up a new direction for topo-spintronics and 2D AFM materials
research.

<h3>Semipermeable interfaces and the target problem</h3>

<br>
<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
In this chapter, we review our recent work on first passage time (FPT)
problems for absorption by a target whose interface is semipermeable. For
pedagogical reasons, we focus on a single Brownian particle searching for a
single target in a bounded domain. We begin by writing down the forward
diffusion equation for the target problem, and define various quantities of
interest such as the survival probability, absorption flux, and the FPT
density. We also present a general method of solution based on Green's
functions and the spectral decomposition of so-called Dirichlet-to-Neumann
(D-to-N) operators. We then use an encounter-based approach to extend the
theory to the case of non-Markovian absorption within the target interior.
Encounter-based models consider the joint probability density or generalized
propagator for particle position and the amount of particle-target contact time
prior to absorption. In the case of a partially absorbing target interior, the
contact time is given by a Brownian functional known as the occupation time.
Finally, we develop a more general probabilistic model of single-particle
diffusion through semi-permeable interfaces, by combining the encounter-based
approach with so-called snapping out Brownian motion (BM). Snapping out BM sews
together successive rounds of partially absorbing BMs that are restricted to
either the interior or the exterior of the semipermeable interface. The rule
for terminating each round is implemented using encounter-based model of
partially absorbing BM. We show that this results in a time-dependent
permeability that can be heavy-tailed.

<h3>Berry Curvature Dipole and its Strain Engineering in Layered Phosphorene</h3>

<br>
<br>
The emergence of the fascinating non-linear Hall effect intrinsically depends
on the non-zero value of the Berry curvature dipole. In this work, we predict
that suitable strain engineering in layered van der Waals material phosphorene
can give rise to a significantly large Berry curvature dipole. Using symmetry
design principles, and a combination of feasible strain and staggered on-site
potentials, we show how a substantial Berry curvature dipole may be engineered
at the Fermi level. We discover that monolayer phosphorene exhibits the most
intense Berry curvature dipole peak near 11.8% strain, which is also a critical
point for the topological phase transition in pristine phosphorene.
Furthermore, we have shown that the necessary strain value to achieve
substantial Berry curvature dipole can be reduced by increasing the number of
layers. We have revealed that strain in these van der Waals systems not only
alters the magnitude of Berry curvature dipole to a significant value but
allows control over its sign. We are hopeful that our predictions will pave way
to realize the non-linear Hall effect in such elemental van der Waals systems.

<h3>On the structure-viscoelasticity relationship of a dually crosslinked  reversible polymer network</h3>

<i>Mounika Gosika, Angel J. Moreno</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform equilibrium Langevin dynamics simulations to understand the
structure-viscoelasticity relationship of a dually crosslinked reversible
polymer network. The cross-linking is achieved by introducing orthogonal
crosslinkers (A and B) in to the polymer backbone, where only intra-species
bonds (A-A or B-B) are allowed to be formed. We study the systems at infinite
dilution and above the overlap concentration of the chains. We find the dually
cross-linked chains to be more compact compared to the singly cross-linked
chains at infinite dilution. At the finite concentration, we also explored the
role of weak (A-A) vs. strong (B-B) bonds in tuning the stress relaxation
behavior of the networks, by systematically varying the relative composition of
A monomers (x) while keeping the total fraction of crosslinks as constant.
Interestingly, we find a non-monotonic trend in the diffusivity and hence in
the stress auto-correlation function of the system w.r.t. x. Furthermore, we
find that in the dynamics in the plateau regime of the stress relaxation
function is dictated by the strength of the weak bonds, whereas the terminal
relaxation behavior of the stress auto-correlation function depends on the
strength of the strong bonds. We also study the influence of the distribution
of the A and B on the stress relaxation by carrying out additional simulations
for a symmetric distribution of the chains. Interestingly, we find the
inter-molecular bonds to be significantly lower in the symmetric case which
makes it to have a faster stress relaxation compared to its random counterpart.
Our study highlight the influence of the composition, distribution, and the
bond energy disparity of the crosslinking monomers in tuning the
viscoelasticity of the dual networks.

<h3>Finite Temperature Entanglement Negativity of Fermionic Symmetry  Protected Topological Phases and Quantum Critical Points in One Dimension</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the logarithmic entanglement negativity of symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) phases and quantum critical points (QCPs) of one-dimensional
noninteracting fermions at finite temperatures. In particular, we consider a
free fermion model that realizes not only quantum phase transitions between
gapped phases but also an exotic topological phase transition between quantum
critical states in the form of the fermionic Lifshitz transition. We find that
the bipartite entanglement negativity between adjacent fermion blocks reveals
the crossover boundary of the quantum critical fan near the QCP between two
gapped phases. Along the critical phase boundary between the gapped phases, the
sudden decrease in the entanglement negativity signals the fermionic Lifshitz
transition responsible for the change in the topological nature of the QCPs. In
addition, the tripartite entanglement negativity between spatially separated
fermion blocks counts the number of topologically protected boundary modes for
both SPT phases and topologically nontrivial QCPs at zero temperature. However,
the long-distance entanglement between the boundary modes vanishes at finite
temperatures due to the instability of SPTs, the phases themselves.

Nontrivial topological superconductivity has received enormous research
attentions due to its potential for diverse applications in topological quantum
computing. The intrinsic issue concerning the correlation between a topological
insulator and a superconductor is, however, still widely open. Here, we
systemically report an emergent superconductivity in a cross-junction composed
of a magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 and a conventional superconductor
NbSe2. Remarkably, the interface indicates existence of a reduced
superconductivity at surface of NbSe2 and a proximity-effectinduced
superconductivity at surface of MnBi2Te4. Furthermore, the in-plane
angular-dependent magnetoresistance measurements reveal the fingerprints of the
paring symmetry behaviors for these superconducting gaps as a unconventional
nature. Our findings extend our views and ideas of topological
superconductivity in the superconducting heterostructures with time-reversal
symmetry breaking, offering an exciting opportunity to elucidate the
cooperative effects on the surface state of a topological insulator aligning a
superconductor.

<h3>Electronic structure study of YNbTiO$_6$ vs. CaNb$_2$O$_6$ with U, Pu  and minor actinide substitutions using compound-tunable embedding potential  method</h3>

<br>
The compound-tunable embedding potential (CTEP) method is applied to study
actinide substitutions in the niobate crystals YNbTiO$_6$ and CaNb$_2$O$_6$.
Two one-center clusters centered on Ca and Y are built and 20 substitutions of
Ca and Y with U, Np, Pu, Am, and Cm in four different oxidation states were
made for each cluster. Geometry relaxation is performed for each resulting
structure, and electronic properties are analyzed by evaluating the spin
density distribution and X-ray emission spectra chemical shifts. Though the
studied embedded clusters with actinides having the same oxidation state are
found in general to yield similar local structure distortions, for Am and Cm in
high "starting" oxidation states the electron transfer from the environment was
found, resulting in decrease of their oxidation states, while for "starting"
U$^{\rm III}$ state the electron transfer goes in the opposite direction,
resulting in increase of its oxidation state to U$^{\rm IV}$.
The U substitutions are additionally studied with the use of multi-center
models, which can provide both more structural and electronic relaxation and
also include charge-compensating vacancies. For "starting" U$^{\rm VI}$ case,
the decrease in oxidation state similar to that of Am$^{\rm VI}$ and Cm$^{\rm
VI}$ in one-center clusters is observed in our calculations but in a different
way.
Since the really synthesized YNbTiO$_6$ structures can not be considered as
perfect (periodic) crystals because the Nb and Ti atoms are statistically
distributed within them occupying the same Wyckoff positions, different Ti
$\leftrightarrow$ Nb substitutions are studied and corresponding structural
changes are estimated.

Nonequilibrium dynamics in spin systems is a topic currently under intense
investigation as it provides fundamental insights into thermalization,
universality, and exotic transport phenomena. While most of the studies have
been focused on ideal closed quantum many-body systems such as ultracold atomic
quantum gases and one-dimensional spin chains, driven-dissipative Bose gases in
steady states away from equilibrium in classical systems also lead to
intriguing nonequilibrium physics. In this work, we theoretically investigate
out-of-equilibrium dynamics of magnons in a gapped Heisenberg quantum
antiferromagnet based on Boltzmann transport theory. We show that, by treating
scattering terms beyond the relaxation time approximation in the Boltzmann
transport equation, energy and particle number conservation mandate that
nonequilibrium magnons cannot relax to equilibrium, but decay to other
nonequilibrium stationary states, partially containing information about the
initial states. The only decay channel for these stationary states back to
equilibrium is through the non-conserving interactions such as boundary or
magnon-phonon scattering. At low temperatures, these non-conserving
interactions are much slower processes than intrinsic magnon-magnon interaction
in a gapped spin system. Using magnon-phonon interaction as a quintessential
type of non-conserving interaction, we then propose that nonequilibrium steady
states of magnons can be maintained and tailored using periodic driving at
frequencies faster than relaxation due to phonon interactions. These findings
reveal a class of classical material systems that are suitable platforms to
study nonequilibrium statistical physics and macroscopic phenomena such as
classical Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles and magnon supercurrents
that are relevant for spintronic applications.

Polarization-resolved electronic Raman spectroscopy is an important
experimental tool to investigate collective excitations in superconductors. In
this work, we present a general theory that allows us to study the evolution of
all Raman active collective modes in multiple symmetry channels across a
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconducting transition. This
comprehensive approach reveals that multiple modes belonging to different
symmetry channels show a tendency to soften, even when the interactions in the
subleading channel are held constant. This indicates an increased competition
induced by the proximity to the TRS breaking transition. The entry into the TRS
broken phase is marked by the introduction of an additional mode into the gap
in multiple symmetry channels. These new modes have a phase character
complementary to the ones that are already present. Even though all the modes
in the TRS broken phase acquire an amplitude character, we explicitly
demonstrate that the coupling to the Raman probe is exclusively through the
phase sector. We demonstrate that the Raman spectrum collected in lower
symmetry channels shows a selective sensitivity to the sign of the ground state
order parameters and the sign of the interband interactions. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of an interaction induced selection rule that
clearly explains the spectral weights of various modes in various irreps,
including the possible of $``$dark$"$ Leggett and Bardasis-Schrieffer modes.

We demonstrate how to devise a Matsubara-formalism based one-loop
approximation to the flow of the functional renormalization group (FRG) that
reproduces identically the leading-logarithmic parquet approximation. This
construction of a controlled fermionic FRG approximation in a regime not
accessible by perturbation theory generalizes a previous study from the
real-time zero-temperature formalism to the Matsubara formalism and thus to the
de facto standard framework used for condensed-matter FRG studies. Our
investigation is based on a simple model for the absorption of x-rays in
metals. It is a core part of our construction to exploit that in a suitable
leading-logarithmic approximation the values of the particle-hole
susceptibility on the real and on the imaginary frequency axis are identical.

We study the microscopic model of electrons in the partially-filled lowest
Landau level interacting via the Coulomb potential by the diagrammatic theory
within the GW approximation. In a wide range of filling fractions and
temperatures, we find a homogeneous non-Fermi liquid (nFL) state similar to
that found in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with logarithmic corrections
to the anomalous dimension. In addition, the phase diagram is qualitatively
similiar to that of SYK: a first-order transition terminating at a critical
end-point separates the nFL phase from a band insulator that corresponds to the
fully-filled Landau level. This critical point, as well as that of the SYK
model -- whose critical exponents we determine more precisely -- are shown to
both belong to the Van der Waals universality class. The possibility of a
charge density wave (CDW) instability is also investigated, and we find the
homogeneous nFL state to extend down to the ground state for fillings $0.2
\lesssim \nu \lesssim 0.8$, while a CDW appears outside this range of fillings
at sufficiently low temperatures. Our results suggest that the SYK-like nFL
state should be a generic feature of the partially-filled lowest Landau level
at intermediate temperatures.

The phenomenon of percolation is one of the core topics in statistical
mechanics. It allows one to study the phase transition known in real physical
systems only in a purely geometrical way. And three things are unavoidable:
death, paying taxes, and excepting universal formula for percolation
thresholds. Anyway, in this paper, we try to solve the third of the enumerated
problems and determine thresholds $p_c$ for random site percolation in
triangular and honeycomb lattices for all available neighborhoods containing
sites from the sixth coordination zone. The results obtained (together with the
percolation thresholds gathered from the literature also for other complex

$p_c\propto(\zeta/K)^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma=0.526(11)$, $0.5439(63)$ and
$0.5932(47)$, for honeycomb, square, and triangular lattice, respectively, and
$p_c\propto\zeta^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma=0.5546(67)$ independently on the
underlying lattice. The index $\zeta=\sum_i z_i r_i$ stands for an average
coordination number weighted by distance, that is, depending on the
coordination zone number $i$, the neighborhood coordination number $z_i$ and
the distance $r_i$ to sites in $i$-th coordination zone from the central site.
The number $K$ indicates lattice connectivity, that is, $K=3$, 4 and 6 for the
honeycomb, square and triangular lattice, respectively. We do not claim that
these results are one giant leap for mankind in searching for such a formula,
but rather they are one small step of a man in that way.

The two-dimensional Coulomb gas is a one-parameter family of random point
processes, depending on the inverse temperature $\beta$. It is proposed as a
simple statistical measure to quantify the intra- and interspecies repulsion
among three different highly territorial birds of prey, by comparing to the
spacing between their nests in the plane. Using data from the area of the
Teutoburger Wald over 20 years, we fit the nearest and next-to-nearest
neighbour spacing distributions between the respective nests of Goshawk, Eagle
Owl and the previously examined Common Buzzard to $\beta$ of the Coulomb gas.
Within each species, the repulsion measured in this way deviates significantly
from the Poisson process of independent points in the plane. In contrast, the
repulsion amongst each of two species is found to be considerably lower and
closer to Poisson. Methodologically we investigate the influence of the
terrain, of a shorter interaction range given by the two-dimensional Yukawa
interaction, and the statistical independence of the time moving average we use
for the yearly ensembles of occupied nests. A simple, approximate analytical
expression for the nearest neighbour spacing distribution derived from
non-Hermitian random matrix theory proves to be very useful, being valid for
the two-dimensional Coulomb gas close to Poisson at $\beta=0$.

Moir\'e structures, along with line-graph-based $d$-electron systems,
represent a setting to realize flat bands. One form of the associated strong
correlation physics is the Kondo effect. Here, we address the Kondo-driven
heavy fermion state and its destruction in AB-stacked hetero-bilayer transition
metal dichalcogenide with tunable filling factor and perpendicular displacement
field. In an extended range of the tunable displacement field, the relative
filling of the more correlated orbital is enforced to be $\nu_d \approx 1$ by
the interaction, which agrees with the experimental observation. We also argue
that the qualitative behavior of the crossover associated with the Kondo
picture in an extended correlation regime provides the understanding of the
energy scales that have been observed in this system. Our results set the stage
to address the amplified quantum fluctuations that the Kondo effect may produce
in these structures and new regimes that the systems open up for
Kondo-destruction quantum criticality.

Antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AFM TIs), which host magnetically
gapped Dirac-cone surface states and exhibit many exotic physical phenomena,
have attracted great attention. The coupling between the top and bottom surface
states becomes significant and plays a crucial role in its low-energy physics,
as the thickness of an AFM TI film decreases. Here, we find that the coupled
surface states can be intertwined to give birth to a set of $2n$ brand new
Dirac cones, dubbed \emph{intertwined Dirac cones}, through the anisotropic
coupling due to the $n$-fold crystalline rotation symmetry $C_{nz}$ ($n=2, 3,
4, 6$) in the presence of an out-of-plane electric field. Interestingly, we
also find that the warping effect further drives the intertwined Dirac-cone
state into a quantum anomalous Hall phase with a high Chern number ($C=n$).
Then, we demonstrate the emergent six intertwined Dirac cones and the
corresponding Chern insulating phase with a high Chern number ($C=3$) in
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$$/$(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_{\mathrm{m}}/$MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ heterostructures
through first-principles calculations. This work discovers a new intertwined
Dirac-cone state in AFM TI thin films and also reveals a new mechanism for
designing the quantum anomalous Hall state with a high Chern number.

<h3>Universal localization-delocalization transition in chirally-symmetric  Floquet drives</h3>

Periodically driven systems often exhibit behavior distinct from static
systems. In single-particle, static systems, any amount of disorder generically
localizes all eigenstates in one dimension. In contrast, we show that in
topologically non-trivial, single-particle Floquet loop drives with chiral
symmetry in one dimension, a localization-delocalization transition occurs as
the time $t$ is varied within the driving period ($0 \le t \le
T_\text{drive}$). We find that the time-dependent localization length
$L_\text{loc}(t)$ diverges with a universal exponent as $t$ approaches the
midpoint of the drive: $L_\text{loc}(t) \sim (t - T_\text{drive}/2)^{-\nu}$
with $\nu=2$. We provide analytical and numerical evidence for the universality
of this exponent within the AIII symmetry class.
