<h3>Positing the problem of stationary distributions of active particles as third-order differential equation</h3>

In this work, we obtain third order linear differential equation for
stationary distributions of run-and-tumble particles in two-dimensions in a
harmonic trap. The equation represents the condition $j=0$ where $j$ is a flux.
Since the analogous equation for passive Brownian particles is first order, a
second and third order term are features of active motion. This manner of
formulating the problem allows us to make advancements in theoretical treatment
and understanding of active particles, given that exact results even for basic
models are elusive. Third order equations are less common in physics and
solutions are more challenging to get. Often such solutions cannot be
represented in a closed form. Such is the case for systems considered in this
work. The formulation of the problem as third order equation can offer insights
into the origin of this elusiveness and play a classifying role. For example,
one of the results established in this work is that an equation and its
solution for one- and two-dimensional system can be scaled onto each other.

<h3>Thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation: properties and an information-theoretic interpretation</h3>

Universal relations that characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium
systems are of fundamental importance. The thermodynamic and kinetic
uncertainty relations impose upper bounds on the precision of currents solely
by total entropy production and dynamical activity, respectively. Recently, a
tighter bound that imposes on the precision of currents by both total entropy
production and dynamical activity has been derived (referred to as the TKUR).
In this paper, we show that the TKUR gives the tightest bound of a class of
inequalities that imposes an upper bound on the precision of currents by
arbitrary functions of the entropy production, dynamical activity, and time
interval. Furthermore, we show that the TKUR can be rewritten as an inequality
between two Kullback-Leibler divergences. One comes from the ratio of entropy
production to dynamical activity, the other comes from the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between two probability distributions defined on two-element set,
which are characterized by the ratio of precision of the time-integrated
current to dynamical activity.
