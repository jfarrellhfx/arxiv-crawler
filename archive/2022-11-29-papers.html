<h3>Single active particle in a harmonic potential: non-existence of the  Jarzynski relation</h3>

The interest in active matter stimulates the need to generalize thermodynamic
description and relations to active matter systems, which are intrinsically out
of equilibrium. One important example is the Jarzynski relation, which links
the exponential average of work done in an arbitrary process connecting two
equilibrium states with the difference of the free energies of these states.
Using a simple model system, a single thermal active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
particle in a harmonic potential, we show that if the standard stochastic
thermodynamics definition of work is used, the Jarzynski relation is not
generally valid for processes between stationary states of active matter
systems.

<h3>Improving estimation of entropy production rate for run-and-tumble  particle systems by high-order thermodynamic uncertainty relation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15973</a>

Abstract Entropy production plays an important role in the regulation and
stability of active matter systems, and its rate quantifies the nonequilibrium
nature of these systems. However, entropy production is hard to be
experimentally estimated even in some simple active systems like molecular
motors or bacteria, which may be modeled by the run-and-tumble particle (RTP),
a representative model in the study of active matters. Here we resolve this
problem for an asymmetric RTP in one-dimension, firstly constructing a finite
time thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for a RTP, which works well in
the short observation time regime for entropy production estimation.
Nevertheless, when the activity dominates,i.e., the RTP is far from
equilibrium, the lower bound for entropy production from TUR turns to be
trivial. We address this issue by introducing a recently proposed high-order
thermodynamic uncertainty relation (HTUR), in which the cumulant generating
function of current serve as a key ingredient. To exploit the HTUR, we adopt a
novel method to analytically obtain the cumulant generating function of the
current we study, with no need to explicitly know the time-dependent
probability distribution. The HTUR is demonstrated to be able to estimate the
steady state energy dissipation rate accurately because the cumulant generating
function covers higher-order statistics of the current, including rare and
large fluctuations besides its variance. Compared to the conventional TUR, the
HTUR could give significantly improved estimation of energy dissipation, which
can work well even in the far-from equilibrium regime. We also provide a
strategy based on the improved bound to estimate the entropy production from
moderate amount of trajectory data for experimental feasibility.

The FeRh alloy is an attractive material for studies of magnetic first-order
phase transitions. The phase transition in FeRh from an antiferromagnetic to
the ferromagnetic state is accompanied by the nucleation, growth, and merging
of ferromagnetic clusters. The ferromagnetic phase evolution is studied in
detail, and its various stages are distinguished. Both static properties and
phase transition kinetics (time dependences of magnetization) are investigated.
A comprehensive analysis allows us to determine the ferromagnetic phase
nucleation regions and the main features of phase growth. In addition, the
mechanisms that lead to a change in the ferromagnetic phase growth rate (the
limitation effect and the magnetocaloric effect) were determined. The variation
of phase transition evolution dominant mechanisms depending on the sample
microstructure was shown.

<h3>Activity induced trapping in a saw-tooth ratchet potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15994" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15994</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider an inertial active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle self-propelling in
a saw-tooth ratchet potential. Using the Langevin simulation and matrix
continued fraction method, the particle transport, steady state diffusion, and
coherence in transport are investigated throughout the ratchet. Spatial
asymmetry is found to be the key criterion for the possibility of directed
transport in the ratchet. Interestingly, the simulated particle trajectories
and the corresponding position and velocity distribution functions reveal that
the system passes through an activity-induced transition in the transport from
the running phase to the locked phase with the self-propulsion/activity time of
the dynamics. This is further corroborated by the mean square displacement
(MSD) calculation. The MSD gets suppressed with increase in the persistence of
activity in the medium and finally approaches zero for very large value of self
propulsion time, reflecting a kind of trapping of the particle by the ratchet
for longer persistent of activity in the medium. The non-monotonic behaviour of
the particle current and Peclet number with self propulsion time confirms that
the particle transport and it's coherence can be enhanced or reduced by fine
tuning the persistent duration of activity. Moreover, for an intermediate range
of self-propulsion time in the dynamics as well as for an intermediate range of
mass of the particle, even though the particle current shows a pronounced
unusual maximum with mass, there is no enhancement in the Peclet number,
instead the Peclet number decreases with mass, confirming the degradation of
coherence in transport. Finally, from the analytical calculations, it is
observed that for a highly viscous medium, where the inertial influence is
negligibly small, the particle current approaches the current in the over
damped regime.

<h3>Atomistic simulations of the crystalline-to-amorphous transformation of  gamma-Al2O3 nanoparticles: delicate interplay between lattice distortions,  stresses, and space charges</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16081</a>
<br>
<i>Simon Gramatte, Lars P.H. Jeurgens, Olivier Politano, Jose Antonio Simon Greminger, Florence Baras, Angelos Xomalis, Vladyslav Turlo</i>
<br>
<br>
The size-dependent phase stability of gamma-Al2O3 was studied by large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations over a wide temperature range from 300 to 900 K.
For the gamma-Al2O3 crystal, a bulk transformation to alpha-Al2O3 by an
FCC-to-HCP transition of the O sublattice is still kinetically hindered at 900
K. However, local distortions of the FCC O-sublattice by the formation of
quasi-octahedral Al local coordination spheres become thermally activated, as
driven by the partial covalency of the Al-O bond. On the contrary, spherical
gamma-Al2O3 NPs (with sizes of 6 and 10 nm) undergo a crystalline-to-amorphous
transformation at 900 K, which starts at the reconstructed surface and
propagates into the core through collective displacements of anions and
cations, resulting in the formation of 7- and 8-fold local coordination spheres
of Al. In parallel, the reconstructed Al-enriched surface is separated from the
stoichiometric core by a diffuse Al-depleted transition region. This
compositional heterogeneity creates a disbalance of charges inside the NP,
which induces a net attractive Coulombic force that is strong enough to reverse
the initial stress state in the NP core from compressive to tensile. These
findings disclose the delicate interplay between lattice distortions, stresses,
and space-charge regions in oxide nanosystems. A fundamental explanation for
the reported expansion of metal-oxide NPs with decreasing size is provided,
which has significant implications for e.g. heterogeneous catalysis, NP
sintering, and additive manufacturing of NP-reinforced metal matrix composites.

<h3>Dynamic and Thermodynamic Origins of Motility-Induced Phase Separation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16084" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16084</a>
<br>
<i>Jie Su, Zhiyu Cao, Jin Wang, Huijun Jiang, Zhonghuai Hou</i>
<br>
<br>
Active matter systems are inherently out of equilibrium and break the
detailed balance (DB) at the microscopic scale, exhibiting vital collective
phenomena such as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). Here, we introduce
a coarse-grained mapping method to probe DB breaking in the density-energy
phase space, which allows us to reveal the dynamic and thermodynamic origins of
MIPS based on nonequilibrium potential and flux landscape theory. Hallmarks of
nonequilibrium properties are manifested by identifying the visible probability
flux in the coarse-grained phase space. Remarkably, the flux for the system
with the activity lower than the MIPS threshold tends to ``tear up" the single
potential well of the uniform-density phase to create two wells of phases with
different densities, presenting directly that the nonequilibrium flux is the
dynamic origin of MIPS. Moreover, we find that the obtained entropy production
rate (EPR) of the system undergoes a transition from nearly independent of
activity to increasing proportionally as activity increases after the single
well is "teared up". The transition of EPR's scaling behavior might provide a
hint of the thermodynamic origin of MIPS in the coarse-grained space. Our
findings propose a new route to explore the nonequilibrium nature of active
systems, and provide new insights into dynamic and thermodynamic properties of
MIPS.

<h3>Computational modelling of passive transport of functionalized  nanoparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16181" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16181</a>
<br>
<i>Daniela Moreno-Chaparro, Nicolas Moreno, Florencio Balboa-Usabiaga, Marco Ellero</i>
<br>
<br>
Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) are complex objects present in a variety
of systems ranging from synthetic grafted nanoparticles to viruses. The
morphology and number of the decorating groups can vary widely between systems.
Thus, the modelling of functionalized NPs typically considers simplified
spherical objects as a first-order approximation. At the nanoscale label,
complex hydrodynamic interactions are expected to emerge as the morphological
features of the particles change, and they can be further amplified when the
NPs are confined or near walls. Direct estimation of these variations can be
inferred via diffusion coefficients of the NPs. However, the evaluation of the
coefficients requires an improved representation of the NPs morphology to
reproduce important features hidden by simplified spherical models. Here, we
characterize the passive transport of free and confined functionalized
nanoparticles using the Rigid Multi-Blob (RMB) method. The main advantage of
RMB is its versatility to approximate the mobility of complex structures at the
nanoscale with significant accuracy and reduced computational cost. In
particular, we investigate the effect of functional groups distribution, size
and morphology over nanoparticle translational and rotational diffusion. We
identify that the presence of functional groups significantly affects the
rotational diffusion of the nanoparticles, moreover, the morphology of the
groups and number induce characteristic mobility reduction compared to
non-functionalized nanoparticles. Confined NPs also evidenced important
alterations in their diffusivity, with distinctive signatures in the
off-diagonal contributions of the rotational diffusion. These results can be
exploited in various applications, including biomedical, polymer nanocomposite
fabrication, drug delivery, and imaging

<h3>Persistent currents in a strongly interacting multicomponent Bose gas on  a ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16194" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16194</a>
<br>
<i>Giovanni Pecci, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Mathias Albert, Patrizia Vignolo, Anna Minguzzi</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a two-component Bose-Bose mixture at strong repulsive
interactions in a tightly confining, one-dimensional ring trap and subjected to
an artificial gauge field. By employing the Bethe Ansatz exact solution for the
many-body wavefunction, we obtain the ground state energy and the persistent
currents. For each value of the applied flux, we then determine the symmetry of
the state under particles exchange. We find that the ground-state energy and
the persistent currents display a reduced periodicity with respect to the case
of non-interacting particles, corresponding to reaching states with fractional
angular momentum per particle. We relate this effect to the change of symmetry
of the ground state under the effect of the artificial gauge field. Our results
generalize the ones previously reported for fermionic mixtures with both
attractive and repulsive interactions and highlight the role of symmetry in
this effect

<h3>Optimal power extraction from active particles with hidden states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16377" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16377</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Cocconi, Jacob Knight, Connor Roberts</i>
<br>
<br>
We identify generic protocols achieving optimal power extraction from a
single active particle subject to continuous feedback control under the
assumption that the instantaneous velocity, but not the fluctuating
self-propulsion velocity, is accessible to direct observation. Our Bayesian
approach draws on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism and is
exemplified in the cases of free run-and-tumble and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
dynamics in one dimension. Such optimal protocols extract positive work even in
models characterised by time-symmetric positional trajectories and thus
vanishing informational entropy production rates. We argue that the theoretical
bounds derived in this work are those against which the performance of
realistic active matter engines should be compared.

<h3>Kondo lattice model in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15682</a>
<br>
<i>Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
We systematically study emergent Kondo lattice models from magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene using the topological heavy fermion representation. At
the commensurate fillings, we demonstrate a series of symmetric strongly
correlated metallic states driven by the hybridization between a triangular
lattice of $SU(8)$ local moments and delocalized fermions. In particular, a
(fragile) topological Dirac Kondo semimetal can be realized, providing a
potential explanation for the symmetry-preserving correlated state at $\nu=0$.
We further investigate the stability of the Dirac Kondo semimetal by
constructing a quantum phase diagram showing the interplay between Kondo
hybridization and magnetic correlation. The destruction of Kondo hybridization
suggests that the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene may be on the verge of a
solid-state quantum simulator for the $SU(8)$ Heisenberg model on a triangular
lattice. Experimental implications are also discussed.

<h3>Bulk-boundary correspondence and singularity-filling in long-range  free-fermion chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15690" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15690</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The bulk-boundary correspondence relates topologically-protected edge modes
to bulk topological invariants, and is well-understood for short-range
free-fermion chains. Although case studies have considered long-range
Hamiltonians whose couplings decay with a power-law exponent $\alpha$, there
has been no systematic study for a free-fermion symmetry class. We introduce a
technique for solving gapped, translationally invariant models in the 1D BDI
and AIII symmetry classes with $\alpha>1$, linking together the quantized
winding invariant, bulk topological string-order parameters and a complete
solution of the edge modes. The physics of these chains is elucidated by
studying a complex function determined by the couplings of the Hamiltonian: in
contrast to the short-range case where edge modes are associated to roots of
this function, we find that they are now associated to singularities. A
remarkable consequence is that the finite-size splitting of the edge modes
depends on the topological winding number, which can be used as a probe of the
latter. We furthermore generalise these results by (i) identifying a family of
BDI chains with $\alpha<1$ where our results still hold, and (ii) showing that
gapless symmetry-protected topological chains can have topological invariants
and edge modes when $\alpha -1$ exceeds the dynamical critical exponent.

<h3>Kagome Chiral Spin Liquid in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Moiré  Bilayers</h3>

<i>Johannes Motruk, Dario Rossi, Dmitry A. Abanin, Louk Rademaker</i>
<br>
<br>
At $n=3/4$ filling of the moir\'e flat band, transition metal dichalcogenide
moir\'e bilayers will develop kagome charge order. We derive an effective spin
model for the resulting localized spins and study its phase diagram using
density matrix renormalization group simulations. Using realistic model
parameters relevant for WSe$_2$/WS$_2$, we show that this material can realize
the exotic chiral spin liquid phase and the highly debated kagome spin liquid.
Our work thus shows that the frustration and strong interactions present in TMD
heterobilayers provide an exciting platform to study spin liquid physics.

<h3>Competing topological superconducting phases in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$</h3>

<i>Chang Xu, Ka Ho Wong, Eric Mascot, Dirk K. Morr</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that recent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy
experiments provide strong evidence for the existence of two competing
topological superconducting phases in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. The coupling of
their underlying microscopic mechanisms -- one based on a three-dimensional
topological insulator, one based on two-dimensional superconductivity --
stabilizes topological superconductivity over a wide range of parameters, and
gives rise to two disjoint topological regions in the phase diagram of
FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. We show that the topological origin of these regions
can be identified by considering the form of Majorana edge modes at domain
walls.

The Hall coefficient exhibits anomalous behavior in lightly doped Mott
insulators. For strongly interacting electrons its computation has been
challenged by analytical and numerical obstacles. We calculate the leading
contributions in the recently derived thermodynamic formula for the Hall
coefficient. We obtain its doping and temperature dependence for the square
lattice tJ-model at high temperatures. The second order corrections are
evaluated to be negligible. Quantum Monte Carlo sampling extends our results to
lower temperatures. We find a divergence of the Hall coefficient toward the
Mott limit and a sign reversal relative to Boltzmann equation's weak scattering
prediction. The Hall current near the Mott phase is carried by a low density of
spin-entangled vacancies, which should constitute the Cooper pairs in any
superconducting phase at lower temperatures.

<h3>Spin superfluidity</h3>

The phenomenon of superfluidity (superconductivity) is a possibility of
transport of mass (charge) on macroscopical distances without essential
dissipation. In magnetically ordered media with easy-plane topology of the
order parameter space the superfluid transport of spin is also possible despite
the absence of the strict conservation law for spin. The article addresses
three key issues in the theory of spin superfluidity: topology of the order
parameter space, Landau criterion for superfluidity, and decay of superfluid
currents via phase slip events, in which magnetic vortices cross current
streamlines. Experiments on detection of spin superfluidity are also surveyed.

<h3>Dynamical susceptibility of Skyrmion crystal</h3>

<br>
<i>V. E. Timofeev, D. N. Aristov</i>
<br>
<br>
Using stereographic projection approach we develop a theory for calculation
of dynamical susceptibility tensor of Skyrmion crystals (SkX), formed in thin
ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and in the external
magnetic field. Staying whenever possible within analytical framework, we
employ the model anzats for static SkX configuration and discuss small
fluctuations around it. The obtained formulas are numerically analyzed in the
important case of uniform susceptibility, accessible in magnetic resonance (MR)
experiments. We show that, in addition to three characteristic MR frequencies
discussed earlier both theoretically and experimentally, one should also expect
several resonances of smaller amplitude at somewhat higher frequencies.

<h3>Detection of phonon helicity with Raman scattering in nonchiral crystals</h3>

Recently, it has been predicted that the Berry curvature of electrons can
produce an angular momentum for phonons. In systems with time-reversal
symmetry, the direction of the phonon angular momentum is locked to the phonon
wave vector. Accordingly, this phenomenon has received the name of ``phonon
helicity". Here, we present a theory to unveil the signatures of such phonon
helicity using Raman scattering. We show that the intensity of Raman scattering
for circularly polarized light in BaMnSb$_2$ (a prototypical nonchiral Dirac
insulator) changes under a reversal of the phonon wave vector, and that the
phonon helicity can be inferred from that change. We compare our results to
recent predictions of Raman-based detection of phonon angular momentum in
chiral crystals.

<h3>A ductility-strength metric for chemically complex alloys</h3>

Local lattice distortions (LLD) $-$ relative to average (x-ray) lattice
positions $-$ are expected in multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to the
varying complex chemical environments. We suggest a dimensionless metric to
characterize ductility in MPEAs using LLD. With its innate quantum-mechanical
origins, ductility is clearly affected by LLD arising from increased atomic
charge transfer due to electronegativity differences in each local environment
(often designated by valence electron count (VEC)). To test this metric, we
chose body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory alloys that exhibit a range of
ductility$-$brittleness. The metric was established by combining the
weighted$-$average VEC ($\Delta{w}_{VEC}$) and intrinsic parameters
($\Delta{u}$,$\sqrt{(\Delta{u})^2}$) related to distortion from the average
lattice. The electronic-structure results were calculated using
density-functional theory (DFT) methods. The quantitative rank ordering of
ductile$-$to$-$brittle MPEAs shows good agreement with recent mean-field
estimates and experiments. Our results permit a quick ductility assessment to
guide the design of more ductile high-temperature MPEAs, and potentially
accelerated further if combined with machine-learning.

<h3>Entropy engineering and tunable magnetic order in the spinel high  entropy oxide</h3>

Spinel oxides are an ideal setting to explore the interplay between
configurational entropy, site selectivity, and magnetism in high entropy
oxides. In this work we characterize the magnetic properties of the spinel
(Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni)$_3$O$_4$ and study the evolution of its magnetism as a
function of non-magnetic gallium substitution. Across the range of compositions
studied here, from 0% to 40% Ga, magnetic susceptibility and powder neutron
diffraction measurements show that ferrimagnetic order is robust in the spinel
HEO. However, we also find that the ferrimagnetic order is highly tunable, with
the ordering temperature, saturated and sublattice moments, and magnetic
hardness all varying significantly as a function of Ga concentration. Through
x-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, we are able to correlate this
magnetic tunability with strong site selectivity between the various cations
and the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel structure. In
particular, we find that while Ni and Cr are largely unaffected by the
substitution with Ga, the occupancies of Mn, Co, and Fe are each significantly
redistributed. Ga substitution also requires an overall reduction in the
transition metal valence, and this is entirely accommodated by Mn. Finally, we
show that while site selectivity has an overall suppressing effect on the
configurational entropy, over a certain range of compositions, Ga substitution
yields a striking increase in the configurational entropy and may confer
additional stabilization. Spinel oxides can be tuned seamlessly from the
low-entropy to the high-entropy regime, making this an ideal platform for
entropy engineering.

<h3>Spin contribution to the inverse Faraday effect of non-magnetic metals</h3>

We formulate the spin contribution to the inverse Faraday effect of
non-magnetic metals. We deal with the role of the inversion symmetry, which
forces all electronic bands to be at least twice degenerate at every point in
the Brillouin zone. We show both analytically and numerically that our
formulation of the inverse Faraday effect is invariant under unitary rotation
within the doubly degenerate set of bands. In addition, we show the importance
of resonance-like features in the band structure for the inverse Faraday
effect. Our first-principles computed spin component of the inverse Faraday
effect in a simple metal such as Au is reminiscent of its optical absorption,
with a characteristic d-s resonance in the optical spectrum.

Rare-earth monopnictide (RE-V) semimetal crystals subject to hydrostatic
pressure have shown interesting trends in magnetoresistance, magnetic ordering,
and superconductivity, with theory predicting pressure-induced band inversion.
Yet, thus far, there have been no direct experimental reports of interchanged
band order in RE-Vs due to strain. This work studies the evolution of band
topology in biaxial strained GdSb (001) epitaxial films using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). We find
that biaxial strain continuously tunes the electronic structure from
topologically trivial to nontrivial. Compressive biaxial strain eliminates the
gap between the hole and the electron bands dispersing along the [001]
direction. Using a simple tight-binding model accounting for the orbital
symmetry of each band, we reproduce trends seen in DFT calculations and ARPES
measurements and elucidate the origin of conduction and valence band shifts.
Finally, we discuss the effect of biaxial strain on carrier compensation and
magnetic ordering temperature.

Temperature ($T$) dependent conductance $G = G(T)$ data measured in molecular

present paper emphasizes that this is not necessarily the case. A curve of $\ln
G$ versus $1/T$ decreasing almost linearly (Arrhenius-like regime) and
eventually switching to a nearly horizontal plateau (Sommerfeld regime), or
possessing a slope gradually decreasing with increasing $1/T$ is fully
compatible with a single-step tunneling mechanism. The results for the
dependence of $G$ on $T$ presented include both analytical exact and accurate
approximate formulas and numerical simulations. These theoretical results are
general, also in the sense that they are not limited, e.g., to the (single
molecule electromigrated (SET) or large area EGaIn) fabrication platforms,
which are chosen for exemplification merely in view of the available
experimental data needed for analysis. To be specific, we examine in detail
transport measurements for molecular junctions based on ferrocene (Fc). As a
particularly important finding, we show how the present analytic formulas for
$G=G(T)$ can be utilized to compute the ratio $f = A_{\text{eff}} / A_n$
between the effective and nominal areas of large area Fc-based junctions with
an EGaIn top electrode. Our estimate of $f\approx 0.6 \times 10^{-4}$ is
comparable with previously reported values \ib{based on completely different
methods} for related large area molecular junctions.

Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic materials which are attracting
growing interest for their adapatbility to living systems. To describe their
elastic properties, the classical Oseen-Frank theory requires anomalously small
twist constants and (comparatively) large saddle-splay constants, so large as
to violate one of Ericksen's inequalities, which guarantee that the Oseen-Frank
stored-energy density is bounded below. While such a violation does not prevent
the existence and stability of equilibrium distortions in problems with fixed
geometric confinement, the study of free-boundary problems for droplets has
revealed a number of paradoxical consequences. Minimizing sequences driving the
total energy to negative infinity have been constructed by employing ever
growing needle-shaped tactoids incorporating a diverging twist [Phy. Rev. E
106, 044703 (2022)]. To overcome these difficulties, we propose here a novel
elastic theory that extends for chromonics the classical Oseen-Frank stored
energy by adding a quartic twist term. We show that the total energy of
droplets is bounded below in the quartic twist theory, so that the known
paradoxes are ruled out. The quartic term introduces a phenomenological length
$a$ in the theory; this affects the equilibrium of chromonics confined within
capillary tubes. Use of published experimental data allows us to estimate $a$.

Dislocation dynamic is a typically gradient flow problem, and most of work
solves it just as ODE, which means that the interacting energy of dislocations
is ignored. We take the interaction energy into account and use it to introduce
new methods to speed up the simulation. The non-singular stress field theory is
used to make sure that the interacting energy between dislocations is finite
and computational, and using this the two dimensional discrete dislocation
dynamics can be rewritten into optimal problems. Based on it, the new problems
from 2D dislocation dynamics can be solved by conjugate gradient method and
other optimal methods. We introduce several methods into dislocation dynamics
from the energy point of view and some numerical experiments are presented to
compare different numerical methods, which show that the new methods are able
to speed up relaxation procedures of dislocation dynamics. Those new approaches
help to get the stable states of dislocations more quickly and speed up the
simulations of dislocation dynamics.

<h3>Second magnetization peak, anomalous field penetration, and Josephson  vortices in KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ bilayer pnictide superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15855</a>
<br>
<i>P. V. Lopes, Shyam Sundar, S. Salem-Sugui, Jr., Wenshan Hong, Huiqian Luo, L. Ghivelder</i>
<br>
<br>
We performed magnetization measurements in a single crystal of the
anisotropic bilayer pnictide superconductor KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$, with
$T_c$ $\simeq$ 34 K, for $H$$\parallel$$c$-axis and $H$$\parallel$$ab$-planes.
A second magnetization peak (SMP) was observed in the isothermal $M(H)$ curves
measured below 16 K for $H$$\parallel$$ab$-planes. A peak in the temperature
variation of the critical current density, $J_{c}$($T$), at 16 K, strongly
suggests the emergence of Josephson vortices at lower temperatures, which leads
to the SMP in the sample. In addition, it is noticed that the appearance of
Josephson vortices below 16 K renders easy magnetic flux penetration. A
detailed vortex dynamics study suggests that the SMP can be explained in terms
of elastic pinning to plastic pinning crossover. Furthermore, contrary to the
common understanding, the temperature variation of the first peak field, $H_1$,
below and above 16 K, behaves non-monotonically. A highly disordered vortex
phase, governed by plastic pinning, has been observed between 17 K and 23 K,
within a field region around an extremely large first peak field. Pinning force
scaling suggests that the point defects are the dominant source of pinning for
$H$ $\parallel$$ab$-planes, whereas, for H $\parallel$$c$-axis, point defects
in addition to surface defects are at play. Such disorder contributes to the
pinning due to the variation in charge carrier mean free path,
$\delta$$l$-pinning. Moreover, the large $J_c$ observed in our study is
consistent with the literature, which advocates this material for high magnetic
field applications.

<h3>Yukawa Friedel-Tail pair potentials for warm dense matter applications</h3>

<br>
<br>
Accurate equations of state (EOS) and plasma transport properties are
essential for numerical simulations of warm dense matter encountered in many
high-energy-density situations. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a simulation method
that generates EOS and transport data using an externally provided potential to
dynamically evolve the particles without further reference to the electrons. To
minimize computational cost, pair potentials needed in MD may be obtained from
the neutral-pseudoatom (NPA) approach, a form of single-ion density functional
theory (DFT), where many-ion effects are included via ion-ion correlation
functionals. Standard $N$-ion DFT-MD provides pair potentials via the force
matching technique but at much greater computational cost. Here we propose a
simple analytic model for pair potentials with physically meaningful parameters
based on a Yukawa form with a thermally damped Friedel tail (YFT) applicable to
systems containing free electrons. The YFT model accurately fits NPA pair
potentials or the non-parametric force-matched potentials from $N$-ion DFT-MD,
showing excellent agreement for a wide range of conditions. The YFT form
provides accurate extrapolations of the NPA or force-matched potentials for
small and large particle separations within a physical model. Our method can be
adopted to treat plasma mixtures, allowing for large-scale simulations of
multi-species warm dense matter.

<br>
<br>
We study the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic spinel
$\mathrm{Hg}\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{Se}_4$ by soft-x-ray angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) and first-principles calculations. While
a theoretical study has predicted that this material is a magnetic Weyl
semimetal, SX-ARPES measurements give direct evidence for a semiconducting
state in the ferromagnetic phase. Band calculations based on the density
functional theory with hybrid functionals reproduce the experimentally
determined band gap value, and the calculated band dispersion matches well with
ARPES experiments. We conclude that the theoretical prediction of a Weyl
semimetal state in $\mathrm{Hg}\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{Se}_4$ underestimates the
band gap, and this material is a ferromagnetic semiconductor.

Oxidation states are the charges of atoms after their ionic approximation of
their bonds, which have been widely used in charge-neutrality verification,
crystal structure determination, and reaction estimation. Currently only
heuristic rules exist for guessing the oxidation states of a given compound
with many exceptions. Recent work has developed machine learning models based
on heuristic structural features for predicting the oxidation states of metal
ions. However, composition based oxidation state prediction still remains
elusive so far, which is more important in new material discovery for which the
structures are not even available. This work proposes a novel deep learning
based BERT transformer language model BERTOS for predicting the oxidation
states of all elements of inorganic compounds given only their chemical
composition. Our model achieves 96.82\% accuracy for all-element oxidation
states prediction benchmarked on the cleaned ICSD dataset and achieves 97.61\%
accuracy for oxide materials. We also demonstrate how it can be used to conduct
large-scale screening of hypothetical material compositions for materials
discovery.

<br>
<br>
Dielectric capacitors are widely used in pulsed power electronic devices due
to their ultrahigh power densities and extremely fast charge/discharge speed.
To achieve enhanced energy storage density, both maximum polarization (Pmax)
and breakdown strength (Eb) need to be improved simultaneously. However, these
two key parameters are inversely correlated. In this study, order-disorder
transition induced polar nanoregions (PNRs) have been achieved in PbZrO3 thin
films by making use of the low-energy ion implantation, enabling us overcome
the trade-off between high polarizability and breakdown strength, which leads
to the tripling of the energy storage density from 20.5 J/cm3 to 62.3 J/cm3 as
well as the great enhancement of breakdown strength. This approach could be
extended to other dielectric oxides to improve the energy storage performance,
providing a new pathway for tailoring the oxide functionalities.

<h3>Realization and Topological Properties of Third-Order Exceptional Lines  Embedded in Exceptional Surfaces</h3>

<i>Weiyuan Tang, Kun Ding, Guancong Ma</i>
<br>
<br>
As the counterpart of Hermitian nodal structures, the geometry formed by
exceptional points (EPs), such as exceptional lines (ELs), entails intriguing
spectral topology. We report the experimental realization of order-3
exceptional lines (EL3) that are entirely embedded in order-2 exceptional
surfaces (ES2) in a three-dimensional periodic synthetic momentum space. The
EL3 and the concomitant ES2, together with the topology of the underlying
space, prohibit the evaluation of their topology in the eigenvalue manifold by
prevailing topological characterization methods. We resolve this issue by
defining a winding number that associates with the resultants of the
Hamiltonian. This resultant winding number detects EL3 but ignores the ES2,
allowing the diagnosis of the topological currents carried by the EL3, which
enables the prediction of their evolution under perturbations. Our results
exemplify unprecedented topology of higher-order exceptional geometries and may
inspire new non-Hermitian topological applications.

<br>
The exploration of magnetism in two-dimensional layered materials has
attracted extensive research interest. For the monoclinic phase CrI3 with
interlayer antiferromagnetism, finding a static and robust way of realizing the
intrinsic interlayer ferromagnetic coupling is desirable. In this Letter, we
study the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the nonmagnetic
element (e.g., O, S, Se, N, P, As and C) doped bi- and triple-layer CrI3
systems via first-principles calculations. Our results demonstrate that O, P,
S, As, and Se doped CrI3 bilayer can realize interlayer ferromagnetism. Further
analysis shows that the interlayer ferromagnetic coupling in the doped
few-layer CrI3 is closely related to the formation of localized spin-polarized
state. This finding indicates that insulated interlayer ferromagnetism can be
realized at high doping concentration (larger than 8.33%). When the doping
concentration is less than 8.33%, but larger than 2.08%, an insulator-metal
phase transition can occur since the localized spin-polarized states percolate
to form contiguous grids in few-layer CrI3.

<h3>Dynamics of the Geometric Phase in Inhomogeneous Quantum Spin Chains</h3>

<br>
<br>
The dynamics of the geometric phase are studied in inhomogeneous quantum spin
chains after a quench. Analytic expressions of the Pancharatnam geometric phase
(PGP) are derived, for both the period-two quantum Ising chain (QIC) and the
disordered QIC. In the period-two QIC, due to the period modulation, PGP
changes with time at the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and consequently, the
winding number based on PGP is not quantized anymore. Therefore, PGP and its
winding number are not topological. Nevertheless, they have non-analytic
singularities at the critical times of the dynamical quantum phase transitions
(DQPTs). This relation between PGP and DQPT is further confirmed in the
disordered QIC by decomposing PGP for each quasi-particle mode. The critical
time of DQPT induced by weak disorder is also accompanied by the non-analytic
singularity of PGP. From these observations and analysis, a simple mathematical
theory is suggested to explain the non-analytic behavior of PGP at the critical
time of DQPT, which clarifies that PGP needs not to be topological in the
general case.

<br>
The results of fabrication and characterization of atomic structure of
nanocrystalline thin layers of Y2O3 in cubic and monoclinic phases is reported.
Experimental data demonstrate crystalline ordering in nanocrystalline films
with average grain size of ~10-14 nm both for cubic and monoclinic studied
structures. Density Functional Theory (DFT) based simulations demonstrate
insignificant differences of electronic structure of these phases in the bulk
and on the surfaces. Theoretical modeling also pointed out the significant
broadening of valence and conductive bands caused by means of energy levels
splitting in agreement with experimental data (X-ray photoelectron and
photoluminescence spectra). The presence of various intrinsic and extrinsic
defects (including surface adsorption of carbon mono- and dioxide) does not
promote visible changes in electronic structure of Y2O3 surface for both
studied phases. Optical absorption and luminescence measurements indicate
insignificant bandgap reduction of Y2O3 nanocrystalline layers and the very
little contribution from defect states. Simulation of extrinsic compression and
expanding demonstrate stability of the electronic structure of nanocrystalline
Y2O3 even under significant strain. Results of comprehensive studies
demonstrate that yttrium oxide based nanocrystalline layers are prospective for
various optical applications as a stable material.

<h3>Long-range permeation of wave function and superficial surface state due  to strong quantum size effects in topological Bi/BiSb heterojunctions</h3>

The quantum size effect has a significant impact on electrons, such that it
can even change their topologically protected properties. An example of this
phenomenon is the gap opening in the topologically protected gapless surface
state in finite-thickness topological-insulator films. However, much is not
known about the quantum size effect in topological heterojunctions. In this
study, by calculating the single-particle spectrum of Bi/Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$
based on the well-known Liu-Allen model, we found that the strong quantum size
effect in topological heterojunctions yields an unexpected band alignment. The
wave functions permeate each other through the attached materials, and this
occurs even in 80-nm-thick heterojunctions. Furthermore, we theoretically found
that one of the two major spectra obtained from the Bi surface does not
represent the true surface state of Bi. This finding may overturn the previous
understanding of the topological surface state of Bi.

The gap opening mechanism of a topological insulator, the quantum anomalous
Hall effect and the axion physics are still pressing open questions and a
microscopic viewpoint to further understand the role of magnetism in topology
is highly desirable. In this work we have performed a microscopic
investigation, by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) along with
complementary bulk measurements, on the chalcogenide
(Bi$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$)$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ ($x$ = 0, 0.001, 0.002 and 0.006). Our
analysis of the Gd$^{3+}$ spin dynamics reveal no significant change of the
Fermi surface as a function of Gd$^{3+}$ concentration, which indicates that
the 4$f$ magnetism is different from the non-local effects induced by
transition metals ($d$ electrons) substitutions. Additionally, we observe an
unusual evolution of the Gd$^{3+}$ ESR spectra as a function of the applied
magnetic field, which we discuss considering the magnetic interaction between
Gd$^{3+}$ 4$f$ electrons and impurity centers such as Se vacancies. This
interaction would give rise to a local weak antilocalization effect surrounding
the Gd$^{3+}$ ions. Such mechanism is observable due to particular details of
the Gd$^{3+}$ 4$f$ electrons magnetism in this system compared to $d$
electrons. Our work points out that rare earth substitutions in this model
topological insulator is a promising path to explore the axion insulating
systems.

<br>
In this work, the rich ground-state structure of orthogonally-coupled
symmetric all-antiferromagnetic junctions with easy-plane anisotropy is
reported. Spin reorientation process rather than the traditional spin flop (SF)
occurs, resulting in a novel phase in which N\'{e}el vectors preserve the
mirror-reflection symmetry (termed as ``MRS phase"). The phase transitions
between SF and MRS phases can be either the first- or second-order. After
disturbed by external stimuli, magnons with different parities emerge. For
in-plane dc fields, no couplings between magnons occur. When dc fields become
oblique, coherent couplings between magnons with opposite parity emerge,
leading to anticrossings in resonance frequencies. However, self-hybridization
among magnons with the same parity never happens. More interestingly, spin
waves based on MRS phase are linearly polarized and their polarization
directions can be fine controlled.

We perform numerical simulations of a model micromachine driven by catalytic
chemical reactions. Our model includes a mechano-chemical coupling between the
structural variables and the nonequilibrium variable describing the catalytic
reactions. The time-correlation functions of the structural variables are
calculated and further analyzed in terms of odd Langevin dynamics. We obtain
the effective odd elastic constant that manifests the broken time-reversal
symmetry of a catalytic micromachine. Within the simulation, we separately
estimate the quantity called nonreciprocality and show that its behavior is
similar to that of the odd elasticity. Combining the obtained odd elasticity
and nonreciprocality, we calculate the power efficiency of a micromachine and
discuss how it is influenced by the catalytic chemical reactions. Our approach
suggests a method to extract nonequilibrium properties of a micromachine only
by measuring its structural dynamics when the nonequilibrium variable is a
hidden variable.

We derive and study a spin-orbital model for ions with $d^1$ electronic
configuration on a honeycomb lattice. In this system, the directional character
of $t_{2g}$ orbital leads to extensively degenerate dimerized ground states. We
find that additional interactions from charge transfer processes completely
lift the degeneracy and stabilize the Kekule spin-orbit dimerized phase where
dimers form a kagome superlattice. For such phase, the triplon band spectrum
resembles the electronic band structure of the kagome lattice and becomes
topologically non-trivial in the presence of inter-dimer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions. As an experimental verification of the Kekule dimerized phase, we
propose the thermal Hall experiment, which can directly uncover the topological
profile of the corresponding triplon band spectrum.

Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can exhibit a range of spectacular phenomena
such as the Klein-tunneling-induced quasibound states1-6 and Berry-phase-tuned
energy spectra7-15. According to previous studies, all these interesting
quantum phenomena seem to be well understood in the free electron picture1-15.
However, electronic motion in the GQDs is reduced to quantized orbits by
quantum confinement, which implies that the kinetic energy may be comparable to
or even smaller than the Coulomb energy of the quasiparticles, possibly
resulting in exotic correlated phases in the GQDs. Here we present a scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study of gate-tunable GQDs in
graphene/WSe2 heterostructure devices and report for the first time the
observation of electron-electron interaction and correlation-induced
spin-charge separation in the GQDs. Gating allows us to precise characterize
effects of the electron-electron interaction on the energy spectra of the GQDs.
By measuring density of states as a function of energy and position, we
explicitly uncover two density waves with different velocities in the GQDs,
attributing to spin-charge separation in real space.

In this letter, we have studied the spin torque based magnetization
oscillations and switching in presence of Rashba - Zeeman (RZ), Ruderman -
Kittel - Kasuya - Yoside (RKKY) and Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya (DM) interactions
in a double barrier RZ$|$Heavy Metal (HM)$|$RZ magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).
The system has stable magnetization oscillations and can work as an oscillator
or a switcher for a significant difference in the strength of RKKY and DM
interaction under suitable spin transfer torque (STT). For the proposed system
with same order of RKKY and DM interaction, a nonlinear characteristic of the
magnetization oscillation is observed. However, this nonlinearity of
oscillations can be reduced by an external magnetic field or considering a
material with suitable RZ interaction. In addition to this, our study reveals
the magnetization switching can be tuned by using suitable STT. A dependence of
switching time on layer thickness is also observed. Also, the switching speed
increases with the thickness for systems having either same order of RKKY and
DM interaction or dominated by RKKY interaction. An opposite characteristic is
seen when DM interaction dominates over RKKY interaction.

We study the cubic fixed point for $N=3$ and $4$ by using finite size scaling
applied to data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of the $N$-component
$\phi^4$ model on the simple cubic lattice. We generalize the idea of improved
models to a two-parameter family of models. The two-parameter space is scanned
for the point, where the amplitudes of the two leading corrections to scaling
vanish. To this end, a dimensionless quantity is introduced that monitors the
breaking of the $O(N)$-invariance. For $N=4$, we determine the correction
exponents $\omega_1=0.763(24)$ and $\omega_2=0.082(5)$. In the case of $N=3$,
we obtain $Y_4=0.0142(6)$ for the RG-exponent of the cubic perturbation at the
$O(3)$-invariant fixed point, while the correction exponent
$\omega_2=0.0133(8)$ at the cubic fixed point. Simulations close to the
improved point result in the estimates $\nu=0.7202(7)$ and $\eta=0.0371(2)$ of
the critical exponents of the cubic fixed point for $N=4$. For $N=3$, at the
cubic fixed point, the $O(3)$-symmetry is only mildly broken and the critical
exponents differ only by little from those of the $O(3)$-invariant fixed point.
We find $-0.00001 \lessapprox \eta_{cubic}- \eta_{O(3)} \lessapprox 0.00007$
and $\nu_{cubic}-\nu_{O(3)} =-0.00061(10)$.

<h3>Effects of mortality on stochastic search processes with resetting</h3>

We study the first-passage time to the origin of a mortal Brownian particle,
with mortality rate $\mu$, diffusing in one dimension. The particle starts its
motion from $x>0$ and it is subject to stochastic resetting with constant rate
$r$. We first show that the probability of reaching the target is closely
related to the mean first-passage time of the corresponding problem in absence
of mortality. We then consider the mean and the variance of the first-passage
time conditioned on the event that the particle reaches the target before
dying. When the average lifetime $\tau_\mu=1/\mu$ satisfies
$\tau_\mu>\alpha\tau_D$, where $\tau_D=x^2/(4D)$ is the diffusive time scale
and $\alpha\approx1.575$ is a constant, there is a resetting rate $r_\mu^*$
that maximizes the probability, and there may also be a different rate $r_m$
that minimizes the average time of a successful search; on the other hand, for

progressively eliminates slower search processes, resulting in decreasing mean
first-passage times but also decreasing the probability of success.

Excitons in thin layers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
are highly subject to the strong Coulomb electron-hole interaction in these
materials. Therefore, they do not follow the model system of a two-dimensional
hydrogen atom. We investigate experimentally and theoretically excitonic
properties in both the monolayer (ML) and the bilayer (BL) of MoSe$_2$
encapsulated in hexagonal BN. The measured magnetic field evolutions of the
reflectance contrast spectra of the MoSe$_2$ ML and BL allow us to determine
$g$-factors of intralayer A and B excitons, as well as the so-called
"interlayer" exciton. Furthermore, the dependence of $g$-factors on the number
of layers and excitation state can be explained from first principles
calculations. We demonstrate that the experimentally measured ladder of
excitonic $s$ states in the ML can be reproduced using the $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$
approach with the Rytova-Keldysh potential that describes the electron-hole
interaction. The analogous calculations for the BL case require taking into
account the out-of-plane dielectric response of the MoSe$_2$ BL.

<h3>Do Machine-Learning Atomic Descriptors and Order Parameters Tell the  Same Story? The Case of Liquid Water</h3>

Machine-learning (ML) has become a key workhorse in molecular simulations.
Building an ML model in this context, involves encoding the information of
chemical environments using local atomic descriptors. In this work, we focus on
the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) and their application in studying
the properties of liquid water both in the bulk and at the hydrophobic
air-water interface. By using a statistical test aimed at assessing the
relative information content of different distance measures defined on the same
data space, we investigate if these descriptors provide the same information as
some of the common order parameters that are used to characterize local water
structure such as hydrogen bonding, density or tetrahedrality to name a few.
Our analysis suggests that the ML description and the standard order parameters
of local water structure are not equivalent. In particular, a combination of
these order parameters probing local water environments can predict SOAP
similarity only approximately, and viceversa, the environments that are similar
according to SOAP are not necessarily similar according to the standard order
parameters. We also elucidate the role of some of the metaparameters entering
in the SOAP definition in encoding chemical information.

Solid-state electrolytes (SSE) with high ion conductivity are pivotal for the
development and large-scale adoption of green-energy conversion and storage
technologies such as fuel cells, electrocatalysts and solid-state batteries.
Yet, SSE are extremely complex materials for which general rational design
principles remain indeterminate. Here, we unite first-principles materials
modelling, computational power and modern data analysis techniques to advance
towards the solution of such a fundamental and technologically pressing
problem. Our data-driven survey reveals that the correlations between ion
diffusivity and other materials descriptors in general are monotonic, although
not necessarily linear, and largest when the latter are of vibrational nature
and explicitly incorporate anharmonic effects. Surprisingly, principal
component and k-means clustering analysis show that elastic and vibrational
descriptors, rather than the usual ones related to chemical composition and ion
mobility, are best suited for reducing the high complexity of SSE and
classifying them into universal classes. Our findings highlight the need of
considering databases that incorporate temperature effects to improve our
understanding of SSE and point towards a generalized approach to the design of
energy materials.

Charge carrier dynamics essentially determine the performance of various
optoelectronic applications of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. Among
them, two-dimensional nanoplatelets provide new adjustment freedom for their
unique core/crown heterostructure. Herein, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning
the core size and the lateral quantum confinement, the charge carrier transfer
rate from the crown to the core can be varied by one order of magnitude in
CdSe/CdSeS core/alloy-crown nanoplatelets. In addition, the transfer can be
affected by a carrier blocking mechanism, i.e., the filled carriers hinder
further possible transfer. Furthermore, we found that the biexciton interaction
is oppositely affected by quantum confinement and electron delocalization,
resulting in a non-monotonic variation of the biexciton binding energy with the
emission wavelength. This work provides new observations and insights into the
charge carrier transfer dynamics and exciton interactions in colloidal
nanoplatelets and will promote their further applications in lasing, display,
sensing, etc.

<h3>Rapid Activation of Non-Oriented Mechanophores via Shock Loading and  Spallation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Mechanophores, stimuli-responsive molecules that respond chromatically to
mechanochemical reactions, are important for understanding the coupling between
mechanics and chemistry as well as in engineering applications. However, the
atomic-level understanding of their activation originates from gas phase
studies or under simple linear elongation forces directly on molecules or
polymer chains containing mechanophores. The effect of many-body distortions,
pervasive in condensed-phase applications, is not understood. Therefore, we
performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of a PMMA-spiropyran
co-polymer under dynamic mechanical loading and studied the activation of the
mechanophore under various conditions from dynamical compression to tension
during unloading. Detailed analysis of the all-atom MD trajectories shows that
the mechanophore blocks experience significant many-body intra-molecular
distortion that can significantly decrease the activation barrier as compared
to when deformation rates are slow relative to molecular relaxation timescales.
We find that the reactivity of mechanophores under material compression states
is governed by many-body effects of intra-molecular torsions, whereas under
tension the reactions are governed by tensile stresses.

<h3>Comparative study of first-principles approaches for effective Coulomb  interaction strength $U_{\rm eff}$ between localized $f$-electrons:  lanthanide metals as example</h3>

Since the correlation strength has key influence on the simulation of
strongly correlated materials, many approaches have been proposed to obtain the
parameters using first-principles calculation. However, the comparison of the
different Coulomb strength from these approaches and investigation of the
mechanism behind are still needed. Taking lanthanide metals as example, we
research the factors which affect the effective Coulomb interaction strength
$U_{\rm eff}$ by local screened Coulomb correction (LSCC), linear response (LR)
and constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA) in VASP. The $U^{\rm
LSCC}_{\rm eff}$ value increases from 4.75 eV to 7.78 eV, $U^{\rm LR}_{\rm
eff}$ is almost stable at about 6.0 eV (except for Eu, Er and Lu), and $U^{\rm
cRPA}_{\rm eff}$ shows a two-stage decreasing trend in light lanthanides and
heavy lanthanides. To investigate these difference, we established a scheme to
analyze coexistence and competition between the orbital localization and the
screening effect. We find that LSCC and cRPA are dominated by the orbital
localization and the screening effect respectively, while LR shows a balance of
the competition between the two factors. Additionally, the performance of these
approaches are influenced by different starting points from PBE and PBE+$U$,
especially for cRPA. All these results give useful knowledge for the $U_{\rm
eff}$ of lanthanide materials, and similar analysis can also be used in the
research of other correlation strength simulation approaches.

We prove two rigorous results about the asymptotic behaviour of the numbers
of polygons and self-avoiding walks confined to a square on the square lattice.
Specifically we prove that the dominant asymptotic behaviour of polygons
confined to an LxL square is identical to that of self-avoiding walks that
cross an LxL square from one corner vertex to the opposite corner vertex. We
also prove a result about the subdominant asymptotic behaviour of self-avoiding
walks crossing a square and extend this result to self-avoiding walks crossing
a hypercube in the d-dimensional hypercubic lattice.

Under applied stress, the viscosity of many dense particulate suspensions
increases drastically, a response known as discontinuous shear-thickening
(DST). In some cases, the applied stress can even transform the suspension into
a solid-like shear jammed state. Although shear jamming (SJ) has been probed
for dense suspensions with particles having well-defined shapes, such a
phenomenon for fractal objects has not been explored. Here, using rheology and
in situ optical imaging, we study the flow behaviour of ultra-dilute fractal
suspensions of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) under confinement. We show
a direct transition from flowing to SJ state without a precursory DST in
fractal suspensions at an onset volume fraction, $\phi \sim$ 0.5\%,
significantly lower than that of conventional dense suspensions ($\phi \sim$
55\%). The ultra-low concentration enables us to demonstrate the fragility and
associated contact dynamics of the SJ state, which remain experimentally
unexplored in suspensions. Furthermore, using a generalized Wyart-Cates model,
we propose a generic phase diagram for fractal suspensions that captures the
possibility of SJ without prior DST over a wide range of shear stress and
volume fractions.

The long search for insulating materials that possess low-energy
quasiparticles carrying electron's quantum numbers except charge - inspired by
the neutral spin-1/2 excitations, the so-called spinons, exhibited by
Anderson's resonating-valence-bond state - seems to have reached a turning
point after the discovery of several Mott insulators displaying same thermal
and magnetic properties as metals, including quantum oscillations in a magnetic
field. Here, we show that such anomalous behaviour is not inconsistent with
Landau's Fermi liquid theory of quasiparticles at a Luttinger surface. That is
the manifold of zeros within the Brillouin zone of the single-particle Green's
function at zero frequency, and which thus defines the spinon Fermi surface
conjectured by Anderson.

<h3>Strong gate-tunability of flat bands in bilayer graphene due to moiré  encapsulation between hBN monolayers</h3>

When using hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) as a substrate for graphene, the
resulting moir\'e pattern creates secondary Dirac points. By encapsulating a
multilayer graphene within aligned hBN sheets the controlled moir\'e stacking
may offer even richer benefits. Using advanced tight-binding simulations on
atomistically-relaxed heterostructures, here we show that the gap at the
secondary Dirac point can be opened in selected moir\'e-stacking
configurations, that is independent of any additional vertical gating of the
heterostructure. On the other hand, gating can broadly tune the gap at the
principal Dirac point, and may thereby strongly compress the first moir\'e
mini-band in width against the moir\'e-induced gap at the secondary Dirac
point. We reveal that in hBN-encapsulated bilayer graphene this novel mechanism
can lead to bands flatter than 10meV under moderate gating, hence presents a
convenient pathway towards electronically-controlled strongly-correlated states
on demand.

Thermo-osmotic flows - generated at liquid-solid interfaces by thermal
gradients - can be used to produce electric currents from waste heat on charged
surfaces. The two key parameters controlling the current are the surface charge
and the interfacial enthalpy excess due to liquid-solid interactions. While it
has been shown that the contribution from water to the enthalpy excess can be
critical, how this contribution is affected by surface charge remained to be
understood. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the
impact of surface charge density on the interfacial enthalpy excess, for
different distributions of the surface charge, and two different wetting
conditions. We observe that surface charge has a strong impact on enthalpy
excess, and that the dependence of enthalpy excess on surface charge depends
largely on the surface charge distribution. In contrast, wetting has a very
small impact on the charge-enthalpy coupling. We rationalize the results with
simple analytical models, which can be used as guidelines to search for systems
providing optimal waste heat recovery performance.

This note addresses the problem of computing fermion propagators in a broad
variety of strongly correlated systems that can be mapped onto the theory of
fermions coupled to an (over)damped bosonic mode. A number of the previously
applied approaches and their results are reviewed, including the conventional
diagrammatic resummation and eikonal technique, as well as the 'experimental'
higher dimensional bosonization and generalized (i.e., 'bottom-up' or
'non-AdS/non-CFT') holographic conjecture. It appears that, by and large, those
results remain either in conflict or incomplete, thereby suggesting that the
ultimate solution to this ubiquitous problem is yet to be found.

A family of magnetic halide double perovskites (HDPs) have recently attracted
attention due to their potential to broaden application areas of halide double
perovskites into e.g. spintronics. Up to date the theoretical modelling of
these systems have relied on primitive approximations to the density functional
theory (DFT). In this paper, we study structural, electronic and magnetic
properties of the Fe$^{3+}$-containing HDPs Cs$_2$AgFeCl$_6$ and
Cs$_2$NaFeCl$_6$ using a combination of more advanced DFT-based methods,
including DFT+U, hybrid-DFT and treatments of various magnetic states. We
examine the effect of varying the effective Hubbard parameter, U$_{eff}$, in
DFT+U and the mixing-parameter, $\alpha$, in hybrid DFT on the electronic
structure and structural properties. Our results reveal a set of localized
Fe(d) states that are highly sensitive to these parameters. Cs$_2$AgFeCl$_6$
and Cs$_2$NaFeCl$_6$ are both antiferromagnets with Ne\'el temperatures well
below room temperature and are thus in their paramagnetic (PM) state at the
external conditions relevant to most applications. Therefore, we have examined
the effect of disordered magnetism on the electronic structure of these systems
and find that while Cs$_2$NaFeCl$_6$ is largely unaffected, Cs$_2$AgFeCl$_6$
shows significant renormalization of its electronic band structure.

Van der Waals assembly enables exquisite design of electronic states in
two-dimensional (2D) materials, often by superimposing a long-wavelength
periodic potential on a crystal lattice using moir\'e superlattices. Here we
show that electronic states in three-dimensional (3D) crystals such as graphite
can also be tuned by the superlattice potential arising at the interface with
another crystal, namely, crystallographically aligned hexagonal boron nitride.
Such alignment is found to result in a multitude of Lifshitz transitions and
Brown-Zak oscillations for near-surface 2D states whereas, in high magnetic
fields, fractal states of Hofstadter's butterfly extend deep into graphite's
bulk. Our work shows a venue to control 3D spectra by using the approach of 2D
twistronics.

Quantum many-body systems with spin degree of freedom may exhibit novel
phases and emergent phenomena that can only described beyond mean-field
theories. In this work, we present a generic and systematic method to fully
determine the variational perturbations of a mean-field solution of interacting
spinor systems with rotational symmetry. The method is based in a
generalization of the Majorana stellar representation for quantum mixed states
and group symmetry arguments. We apply the approach using the system of the
spinor Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin 1 and 2. To further exemplify
the advantages of the method, we calculate the phase diagram of a spin-2 BEC at
finite temperatures.

Superconductivity has been previously observed in magic-angle twisted stacks
of monolayer graphene but conspicuously not in twisted stacks of bilayer
graphene, although both systems host topological flat bands and symmetry-broken
states. Here, we report the discovery of superconductivity in twisted double
bilayer graphene (TDBG) in proximity to WSe$_2$. Samples with twist angles
1.24$^\circ$ and 1.37$^\circ$ superconduct in small pockets of the gate-tuned
phase diagram within the valence and conduction band, respectively.
Superconductivity emerges from unpolarized states near van Hove singularities
and next to regions with broken isospin symmetry, showing the correlation
between a high density of states and the emergence of superconductivity in TDBG
while revealing a possible role for isospin fluctuations in the pairing.

Layered crystalline materials that consist of transition metal atoms laid out
on a kagome network emerged as a versatile platform to study novel electronic
phenomena. Within this realm, vanadium-based kagome superconductors AV3Sb5
(A=K, Cs, Rb) recently attracted a large interest for various exotic electronic
states. These states arise within a parent charge density wave (CDW) phase that
appears to simultaneously break both the translational and the rotational
symmetry of the lattice. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling
microscopy to study a newly synthesized kagome metal CsTi3Bi5, which is
isostructural to AV3Sb5 but with a titanium atom kagome network. In sharp
contrast to its vanadium-based counterpart, CsTi3Bi5 does not exhibit
detectable CDW states. By imaging the scattering and interference of electrons,
we obtain momentum-space information about the low-energy electronic structure
of CsTi3Bi5. A comparison to our density functional theory calculations reveals
substantial electronic correlation effects at low-energies in this material.
Remarkably, by comparing the amplitudes of scattering wave vectors along
different directions, we discover a pronounced electronic anisotropy that
breaks the six-fold symmetry of the lattice, arising from both in-plane and
out-of-plane titanium-derived d orbitals. Our experiments reveal the emergence
of a genuine electronic nematic order in CsTi3Bi5, the first among the "135"
family of kagome metals, which is in contrast to the vanadium-based AV3Sb5
where rotation symmetry breaking appears to be intertwined with the CDW. Our
work also uncovers the significant role of electronic orbitals in the kagome
metal CsTi3Bi5, suggestive of a hexagonal analogue of the nematic bond order in
Fe-based superconductors.

Computational catalysis is playing an increasingly significant role in the
design of catalysts across a wide range of applications. A common task for many
computational methods is the need to accurately compute the minimum binding
energy - the adsorption energy - for an adsorbate and a catalyst surface of
interest. Traditionally, the identification of low energy adsorbate-surface
configurations relies on heuristic methods and researcher intuition. As the
desire to perform high-throughput screening increases, it becomes challenging
to use heuristics and intuition alone. In this paper, we demonstrate machine
learning potentials can be leveraged to identify low energy adsorbate-surface
configurations more accurately and efficiently. Our algorithm provides a
spectrum of trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, with one balanced
option finding the lowest energy configuration, within a 0.1 eV threshold,
86.63% of the time, while achieving a 1387x speedup in computation. To
standardize benchmarking, we introduce the Open Catalyst Dense dataset
containing nearly 1,000 diverse surfaces and 87,045 unique configurations.
