<h3>Active Spherical Model</h3>

The spherical model is a popular solvable model and has been applied to
describe several critical phenomena such as the ferromagnetic transition,
Bose-Einstein condensation, spin-glass transition, glass transition, jamming
transition, and so on. Motivated by recent developments of active matter, here
we consider the spherical model driven by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type noise
with persistent time $\tau_p$. We show that for finite $\tau_p$, the model has
the same universality of that of the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase
transition. In the limit $\tau_p\to\infty$, on the contrary, the model shows
the random field Ising universality.

<h3>Generalized Higgs mechanism in long-range interacting quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10487v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10487v1</a>

The physics of long-range interacting quantum systems is currently living a
renaissance driven by the fast progress in quantum simulators. In these systems
many paradigms of statistical physics do not apply and also the universal
long-wavelength physics gets substantially modified by the presence of
long-ranged forces. Here we explore the low-energy excitations of several
long-range interacting quantum systems, including spin models and interacting
Bose gases, in the ordered phase associated with the spontaneous breaking of
U(1) and SU(2) symmetries. Instead of the expected Goldstone modes, we find
three qualitatively different regimes, depending on the range of the
interaction. In one of these regimes the Goldstone modes are gapped, via a
generalization of the Higgs mechanism. Moreover, we show how this effect is
realized in current experiments with ultracold atomic gases in optical
cavities.

A superfluid spontaneously breaks the usual $U(1)$ symmetry because of
condensation. In this article, we illustrate six classes of emergent $U(1)$
symmetries naturally appear in infrared limits in a broad class of gapless
topological superfluids (that either belong to a stable phase or are quantum
critical). In gapless states we have considered, emergent $U(1)$ symmetry
groups are embedded in an $Spin(4)=SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ group that are
algebraically isomorphic to an $SO(4)$ group. All $U(1)$ charges associated
with symmetries are further invariant under an $SU(2)$ spin group or an
equivalent of it but always break pre-existing higher space-time Lorentz
symmetry of $SO(3,1)$ group. Emergent $U(1)$ symmetries can be further
spontaneously broken only if interactions are strong enough and resultant
strong coupling states become fully gapped. However if states remain gapless,
emergent $U(1)$ symmetries are always present, despite that these states may
exhibit much lower space-time symmetries compared to their weakly interacting
gapless Lorentz symmetric counter parts. In the limit of our interests, we have
identified all possible gapless real fermions with or without Lorentz
symmetries and find that they all display emergent $U(1)$ symmetries in the
infrared limit.We argue emergent $U(1)$ symmetries in infrared are intrinsic in
a broad class of interacting gapless superfluid or superconducting states and
are typically well defined in high dimensions where there are infrared stable
fixed points dictating emergent properties.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10485v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10485v1</a>

<i>Hongqin Liu</i>

<br>
In this work the interface system of the van der Waals fluid is investigated
by using the density gradient theory incorporated with the mean-field theory.
Based on the mean-field dividing interface generated by the Maxwell
construction, we propose a highly accurate density profile model for the
density gradient theory, which facilitates reliable predictions of various
properties for the interface region. It is found that the local intrinsic
Helmholtz free energy peaks at the interface and that the maximum difference of
the normal and tangential components of the pressure tensor corresponds to the
maximum of the intrinsic Gibbs free energy. It is found that the entire phase
space is divided into gas-like and liquid-like regions by the single line
composed of the mean-field interface and the Widom line. The two-fluid feature
of the supercritical fluid is hence inherited from the coexistence region.
Phase diagrams extended into the coexistence region in all the
temperature-pressure-volume planes are thus completed with the solutions to the
vapor-liquid equilibrium problem by the van der Waals equation of state.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10446v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10446v1</a>
<br>

<br>
We define a new mass transport model on a one-dimensional lattice of size $N$
with continuous masses at each site. The lattice is connected to mass
reservoirs of different `chemical potentials' at the two ends. The mass
transfer dynamics in the bulk is equivalent to the dynamics of the gaps between
particles in the Random Average Process. In the non-equilibrium steady state,
we find that the multi-site arbitrary order cumulants of the masses can be
expressed as an expansion in powers of $1/N$ where at each order the cumulants
have a scaling form. We introduce a novel operator approach which allows us to
compute these scaling functions at different orders of $1/N$. Moreover, this
approach reveals that, to express the scaling functions for higher order
cumulants completely one requires all lower order multi-site cumulants. This is
in contrast to the Wick's theorem in which all higher order cumulants are
expressed solely in terms of two-site cumulants. We support our results with
evidence from Monte-Carlo simulations.

<br>
<br>
Unconventional fermions in the immensely studied topological semimetals are
the source for rich exotic topological properties. Here, using symmetry
analysis and first-principles calculations, we propose the coexistence of
multiple topological nodal structure in LaSb2, including topological nodal
surfaces, nodal lines and in particular eightfold degenerate nodal points,
which have been scarcely observed in a single material. Further, utilizing high
resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with
Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations measurements, we confirm the existence
of nodal surfaces and eightfold degenerate nodal points in LaSb2, and extract
the {\pi} Berry phase proving the non-trivial electronic band structure
topology therein. The intriguing multiple topological nodal structure might
play a crucial role in giving rise to the large linear magnetoresistance. Our
work renews the insights into the exotic topological phenomena in LaSb2 and its
analogous.

<br>
<br>
Quantum transport measurements are performed in gate-defined, high-quality,
two-dimensional hole and electron systems in an undoped InSb quantum well. For
both polarities, the carrier systems show tunable spin-orbit interaction as
extracted from weak anti-localization measurements. The effective mass of InSb
holes strongly increases with carrier density as determined from the
temperature dependence of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Coincidence
measurements in a tilted magnetic field are performed to estimate the spin
susceptibility of the InSb two-dimensional hole system. The g-factor of the
two-dimensional hole system decreases rapidly with increasing carrier density.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10420v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10420v1</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Coretti, Sebastian Falkner, Phillip Geissler, Christoph Dellago</i>
<br>
<br>
Generative models are a promising tool to address the sampling problem in
multi-body and condensed-matter systems in the framework of statistical
mechanics. In this work, we show that normalizing flows can be used to learn a
transformation to map different liquid systems into each other allowing at the
same time to obtain an unbiased equilibrium distribution through a reweighting
process. Two proof-of-principles calculations are presented for the
transformation between Lennard-Jones systems of particles with different depths
of the potential well and for the transformation between a Lennard-Jones and a
system of repulsive particles. In both numerical experiments, systems are in
the liquid state. In future applications, this approach could lead to efficient
methods to simulate liquid systems at ab-initio accuracy with the computational
cost of less accurate models, such as force field or coarse-grained
simulations.

<a href = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.045103">http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.045103</a>
<br>
<i>S. Malick, J. Singh, A. Laha, V. Kanchana, Z. Hossain, D. Kaczorowski</i>
<br>
<br>
High-quality single crystals of EuAuAs were studied by means of powder x-ray
diffraction, magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, electrical
resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements. The compound crystallizes with
a hexagonal structure of the ZrSiBe type (space group $P6_3/mmc$). It orders
antiferromagnetically below 6 K due to the magnetic moments of divalent Eu
ions. The electrical resistivity exhibits metallic behavior down to 40 K,
followed by a sharp increase at low temperatures. The magnetotransport
isotherms show a distinct metamagnetic-like transition in concert with the
magnetization data. The antiferromagnetic ground state in \mbox{EuAuAs} was
corroborated in the \textit{ab initio} electronic band structure calculations.
Most remarkably, the calculations revealed the presence of nodal line without
spin-orbit coupling and Dirac point with inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. The
\textit{Z}$_2$ invariants under the effective time reversal and inversion
symmetries make this system nontrivial topological material. Our findings,
combined with experimental analysis, makes EuAuAs a plausible candidate for an
antiferromagnetic topological nodal-line semimetal.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10401v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10401v1</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Li, Zhipeng Sun, Yingze Su, Haiqing Lin, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li</i>
<br>
<br>
The calculation of response functions in correlated electronic systems is one
of the most important problems in the condensed matter physics. To obtain a
physical response function, preserving both the Ward-Takahashi identity and the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem are crucial. Here we propose a self-consistent
many body method within the GW framework to calculate the response functions
based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which also satisfies the
Ward-Takahashi identity. The validity of this methodology is demonstrated on
the two-dimensional one-band Hubbard model, where both the Ward-Takahashi
identity and fluctuation-dissipation theorem are verified numerically.
Moreover, comparing to the accurate spin susceptibility of the determinantal
Monte Carlo approach, the results obtained from our method are quite
satisfactory and the computational cost are greatly reduced.

<br>
<br>
The electronic and structural properties of atomically thin materials can be
controllably tuned by assembling them with an interlayer twist. During this
process, constituent layers spontaneously rearrange themselves in search of a
lowest energy configuration. Such relaxation phenomena can lead to unexpected
and novel material properties. Here, we study twisted double trilayer graphene
(TDTG) using nano-optical and tunneling spectroscopy tools. We reveal a
surprising optical and electronic contrast, as well as a stacking energy
imbalance emerging between the moir\'e domains. We attribute this contrast to
an unconventional form of lattice relaxation in which an entire graphene layer
spontaneously shifts position during fabrication. We analyze the energetics of
this transition and demonstrate that it is the result of a non-local relaxation
process, in which an energy gain in one domain of the moire lattice is paid for
by a relaxation that occurs in the other.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10381v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10381v1</a>
<br>
<i>Masaru Onoda</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive the analytical solutions of surface states in a series of lattice
models for three-dimensional topological insulators and their nontopological
counterparts based on an ansatz. A restriction on the spin-flip matrices in
nearest-neighbor hopping characterizes the series. This restriction affords the
ansatz and favors analytical solvability of surface-state eigenvectors. Despite
the restriction, the series retains sufficient designability to describe
various types of surface states. We also mention how it can serve as a
tractable tool for elucidating unique phenomena on topological surfaces.

Strongly interacting electrons in layered materials give rise to a plethora
of emergent phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity. heavy
fermions, and spin textures with non-trivial topology. Similar effects can also
be observed in bulk materials, but the advantage of two dimensional (2D)
systems is the combination of local accessibility by microscopic techniques and
tuneability. In stacks of 2D materials, for example, the twist angle can be
employed to tune their properties. However, while material choice and twist
angle are global parameters, the full complexity and potential of such
correlated 2D electronic lattices will only reveal itself when tuning their
parameters becomes possible on the level of individual lattice sites. Here, we
discover a lattice of strongly correlated electrons in a perfectly ordered 2D
supramolecular network by driving this system through a cascade of quantum
phase transitions using a movable atomically sharp electrostatic gate. As the
gate field is increased, the molecular building blocks change from a
Kondo-screened to a paramagnetic phase one-by-one, enabling us to reconstruct
their complex interactions in detail. We anticipate that the supramolecular
nature of the system will in future allow to engineer quantum correlations in
arbitrary patterned structures.

We have analytically explored artificial magnetism of 3-D spin-polarized
harmonically trapped ideal Fermi gas of electrically neutral particles exposed
to a constant synthetic magnetic field. We have unified the artificial Landau
diamagnetism and the artificial de Haas-van Alphen effect in a single framework
for all temperatures as well as for all possible values of the synthetic
magnetic field. Our prediction is testable in the present-day experimental
setup.

<br>
<br>
A-site ordered perovskites, CaCu$_3$B$_4$O$_{12}$, which are derivatives of
conventional ABO$_3$ perovskites, exhibit varying electronic and magnetic
properties. With the objective of examining the role of Cu in this work, we
have studied CaCu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$ and CaCu$_3$Zr$_4$O$_{12}$ and presented
the cause of the crystallization of A-site ordered perovskite from conventional
ABO$_3$ perovskite and the underlying mechanism leading to the stabilization of
non-trivial and experimentally estabilished G-type antiferromagnetic (G-AFM)
ordering in these systems. The first-principles electronic structure
calculations supplemented with phonon studies show that the formation of A-site
ordered perovskite is driven by Jahn-Teller distortion of the CuO$_{12}$
icosahedron. The crystal orbital Hamiltonian population analysis and magnetic
exchange interactions estimated using spin dimer analysis infers that the
nearest and next-nearest-neighbor interactions (J$_1$ and J$_2$) are direct and
weakly ferromagnetic whereas the third-neighbor interaction (J$_3$) is
unusually strong and antiferromagnetic driven by indirect superexchange
mechanism. The structural geometry reveals that stabilization of G-AFM requires
J$_1$ $<$ 2J$_2$, J$_1$ $<$ 2J$_3$. The experimental and theoretical values of
Neel Temperature agrees well for $U$ $\approx$ 7 eV, highlighting the role of
strong correlation. The magnetic ordering is found to be robust against
pressure and strain.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10314v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10314v1</a>
<br>
<i>Yongjian Wang, Thomas Boemerich, Jinhong Park, Henry F. Legg, A. A. Taskin, Achim Rosch, Yoichi Ando</i>
<br>
<br>
In a nodal-line semimetal (NLSM), the crossing of the conduction and valence
bands leaves an extended loop of band-touching points, called a nodal line.
Together with three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals,
NLSMs belong to the family of topological semimetals and their low-energy
physics is described by a Dirac equation with additional symmetry-breaking
terms. Intriguingly, it has been theoretically show that in NLSMs, ultra-flat
bands generically emerge as a result of Landau quantization in magnetic fields
parallel to the nodal-line plane. Here we report that in the NLSM ZrTe$_5$,
when the current and the magnetic field are both along the crystallographic $a$
axis, the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics presents a pronounced
nonlinearity. We argue that this nonlinear transport in ZrTe$_5$ is likely due
to the combined effect of flat bands and charge puddles, the latter appear due
to very low carrier densities. In particular, the magnetic-field dependence of
the nonlinear coefficient is well explained by the Boltzmann theory for
flat-band transport. The emergence of flat bands makes NLSM an interesting
platform to pursue strong correlation physics in a topological material.

A quantum two-level system immersed in a sub-Ohmic bath experiences enhanced
low-frequency quantum statistical fluctuations which render the nonequilibrium
quantum dynamics highly non-Markovian. Upon using the numerically exact
time-evolving matrix product operator approach, we investigate the phase
diagram of the polarization dynamics. In addition to the known phases of damped
coherent oscillatory dynamics and overdamped decay, we identify a new third
region in the phase diagram for strong coupling showing an aperiodic behaviour.
We determine the corresponding phase boundaries. The dynamics of the quantum
two-state system herein is not coherent by itself but slaved to the oscillatory
bath dynamics.

All-atom simulations have become increasingly popular to study conformational
and dynamical properties of nucleic acids as they are accurate and provide high
spatial and time resolutions. This high resolution however comes at a heavy
computational cost and within the time scales of simulations nucleic acids
weakly fluctuate around their ideal structure exploring a limited set of
conformations. We introduce the RBB-NA algorithm which is capable of
controlling rigid base parameters in all-atom simulations of Nucleic Acids.
With suitable biasing potentials this algorithm can "force" a DNA or RNA
molecule to assume specific values of the six rotational (tilt, roll, twist,
buckle, propeller, opening) and/or the six translational parameters (shift,
slide, rise, shear, stretch, stagger). The algorithm enables the use of
advanced sampling techniques to probe the structure and dynamics of locally
strongly deformed Nucleic Acids. We illustrate its performance showing some
examples in which DNA is strongly twisted, bent or locally buckled. In these
examples RBB-NA reproduces well the unconstrained simulations data and other
known features of DNA mechanics, but it also allows one to explore the
anharmonic behavior characterizing the mechanics of nucleic acids in the high
deformation regime.

Transport in disordered media, such as those involving charge carriers in
amorphous semiconductors, or contaminants in hydrogeological systems, are often
described by time scale-free processes. We study the statistical properties of
the first passage time of biased processes in different models, and employ the
big jump principle that shows the dominance of the maximum trapping time on the
first passage time. Inspired by the restart paradigm, we demonstrate that the
removal of this maximum significantly expedites transport. As the disorder
increases, the system enters a phase where the removal shows a dramatic effect.
Our results show how we may speed up transport in strongly disordered systems
exploiting scale invariance.

<br>
<br>
We show that topological superconductivity can be generally induced in a
magnetic metal through the superconducting proximity effect. In this case, the
topological superconductivity originates from band degeneracies controlled by
crystalline symmetries. We demonstrate this general scheme in a model with a
4-fold band degeneracy protected by the space group P4=nmm. We show that first
order or second-order topological superconductivity can be realized in the
presence of a ferromagnetic order or an antiferromagnetic order respectively.
We derive the corresponding topological invariants and analyze Majorana modes.
Our study provides a general method to realize topological superconductivity
and help to identify new platforms to generate Majorana zero modes.

Laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization is a phenomenon of utmost interest
and attracts significant attention because it enables potential applications in
ultrafast optoelectronics and spintronics. As a spin-orbit coupling assisted
magnetic insulator, $\alpha$-$RuCl_3$ provides an attractive platform to
explore the physics of electronic correlations and related unconventional
magnetism. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we explore the
ultrafast laser-induced dynamics of the electronic and magnetic structures in
$\alpha$-$RuCl_3$. Our study unveils that laser pulses can introduce ultrafast
demagnetizations in $\alpha$-$RuCl_3$, accompanied by an out-of-equilibrium
insulator-to-metal transition in a few tens of femtoseconds. The spin response
significantly depends on the laser wavelength and polarization on account of
the electron correlations, band renormalizations and charge redistributions.
These findings provide physical insights into the coupling between the
electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom in $\alpha$-$RuCl_3$ and shed light
on suppressing the long-range magnetic orders and reaching a proximate spin
liquid phase for two-dimensional magnets on an ultrafast timescale.

We consider the problem of the first passage time to the origin, starting
from an initial site $ x_0 $, of a spatially non-homogeneous random walk with a
position-dependent drift, known as the Gillis random walk, in the presence of a
stochastic resetting mechanism which, with fixed probability $ r $, at each
time step may relocate the particle to a given site $ x_r $. From a general
perspective, we first derive a series of results regarding the first and the
second moment of the first hitting time distribution, valid for a wide class of
processes, including random walks lacking the property of translational
invariance; we then apply these results to the specific model and corroborate
the theoretical findings with numerical simulations.

We perform a polarization-resolved magnetoluminescence study of excitons in
ReS$_2$. We observe that two linearly polarized Rydberg series of excitons are
accompanied by two other Rydberg series of dark excitons, brightened by an
in-plane magnetic field. All series extrapolate to the same single-electron
bandgap, indicating that the observed excitons originate either from the same
valley or from two valleys related by the inversion symmetry, and are split by
exchange interaction. To interpret our observations of the magnetic
brightening, we have to assume the dominant spin-orbit coupling to be
Ising-like, which hints at an approximate symmetry of the electronic states in
ReS$_2$ which is higher than the crystal symmetry $C_i$.

In the single-source sandpile model, a number $N$ grains of sand are
positioned at a central vertex on the 2-dimensional grid $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We
study the stabilisation of this configuration for a stochastic sandpile model
based on a parameter $M \in \mathbb{N}$. In this model, if a vertex has at
least $4M$ grains of sand, it topples, sending $k$ grains of sand to each of
its four neighbours, where $k$ is drawn according to some random distribution
$\gamma$ with support $\{1,\cdots,M\}$. Topplings continue, a new random number
$k$ being drawn each time, until we reach a stable configuration where all the
vertices have less than $4M$ grains. This model is a slight variant on the one
introduced by Kim and Wang.
  We analyse the stabilisation process described above as $N$ tends to infinity
(for fixed $M$), for various probability distributions $\gamma$. We focus on
two global parameters of the system, referred to as radius and avalanche
numbers. The radius number is the greatest distance from the origin to which
grains are sent during the stabilisation, while the avalanche number is the
total number of topplings made. Our simulations suggest that both of these
numbers have fairly simple asymptotic behaviours as functions of $\gamma$, $N$
and $M$ as $N$ tends to infinity. We also provide a more detailed analysis in
the case where $\gamma$ is the binomial distribution with parameter $p$, in
particular when $p$ tends to $1$. We exhibit a phase transition in that regime
at the scale $p \sim 1/N$.

The spherical model is a popular solvable model and has been applied to
describe several critical phenomena such as the ferromagnetic transition,
Bose-Einstein condensation, spin-glass transition, glass transition, jamming
transition, and so on. Motivated by recent developments of active matter, here
we consider the spherical model driven by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type noise
with persistent time $\tau_p$. We show that for finite $\tau_p$, the model has
the same universality of that of the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase
transition. In the limit $\tau_p\to\infty$, on the contrary, the model shows
the random field Ising universality.
