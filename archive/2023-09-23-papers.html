<h3>Rotational and translational drags of a Janus particle close to a wall  and a lipid membrane</h3>

Hypothesis: Measuring rotational and translational Brownian motion of single
spherical particles reveals dissipations due to the interaction between the
particle and the environment. Experiments: In this article, we show experiments
where the in-plane translational and two rotational drag coefficients of a
single spherical Brownian particle can be measured. These particle drags are
functions of the particle size and the particle-wall distance, and of the
viscous dissipations at play. We measure drag coefficients for Janus particles
close to a solid wall and close to a lipid bilayer membrane. Findings: For a
particle close to wall, we show that according to hydrodynamic models,
particlewall distance and particle size can be determined. For a particle
partially wrapped by lipid membranes, in absence of strong binding
interactions, translational and rotational drags are significantly larger than
the ones of non-wrapped particles. Beside the effect of the membrane viscosity,
we show that dissipations in the deformed membrane cap region strongly
contribute to the drag coefficients.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a U(1) symmetry leads to superfluidity of a
corresponding conserved charge. We generalize the superfluidity to systems with
U(1) symmetries acting on both matter fields and two-dimensional spatial
coordinates. Such systems can be effectively realized in easy-plane
ferromagnetic systems with spin-orbit coupling where the conserved charge is a
total angular momentum. We clarify that under a steady injection of spin
angular momentum, the superfluid of the total angular momentum shows spacetime
oscillations of the spin density and geometry-dependent spin hydrodynamics.
Though a stability analysis shows that the superfluid under the spin injection
is nonideal, the proposed spin transport persists with weak dissipation of the
spin angular momentum. Our study broadens the comprehension of superfluidity
and sheds new light on the interplay between symmetries and phases of matter.

Fluid-structure interactions between active and passive components are
important for many biological systems to function. A particular example is
chromatin in the cell nucleus, where ATP-powered processes drive coherent
motions of the chromatin fiber over micron lengths. Motivated by this system,
we develop a multiscale model of a long flexible polymer immersed in a
suspension of active force dipoles as an analog to a chromatin fiber in an
active fluid -- the nucleoplasm. Linear analysis identifies an orientational
instability driven by hydrodynamic and alignment interactions between the fiber
and the suspension, and numerical simulations show activity can drive coherent
motions and structured conformations. These results demonstrate how active and
passive components, connected through fluid-structure interactions, can
generate coherent structures and self-organize on large scales.

Here we report the first time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(TR-ARPES) with the new Fermiologics "FeSuMa" analyzer. The new experimental
setup has been commissioned at the Artemis laboratory of the UK Central Laser
Facility. We explain here some of the advantages of the FeSuMa for TR-ARPES and
discuss how its capabilities relate to those of hemispherical analyzers and
momentum microscopes. We have integrated the FeSuMa into an optimized
pump-probe beamline that permits photon-energy- (i.e., kz-) dependent scanning,
using probe energies generated from high harmonics in a gas jet. The advantages
of using the FeSuMa in this situation include the possibility of taking
advantage of its "fisheye" mode of operation.

<h3>On the dynamical stability of copper-doped lead apatite</h3>

The recent claim of room temperature superconductivity in a copper-doped lead
apatite compound, called LK-99, has sparked remarkable interest and
controversy. Subsequent experiments have largely failed to reproduce the
claimed superconductivity, while theoretical works have identified multiple key
features including strong electronic correlation, structural instabilities, and
dopability constraints. A puzzling claim of several recent theoretical studies
is that both parent and copper-doped lead apatite structures are dynamically
unstable at the harmonic level, questioning decades of experimental reports of
the parent compound structures and the recently proposed copper-doped
structures. In this work, we demonstrate that both parent and copper-doped lead
apatite structures are dynamically stable at room temperature. Anharmonic
phonon-phonon interactions play a key role in stabilizing some copper-doped
phases, while most phases are largely stable even at the harmonic level. We
also show that dynamical stability depends on both volume and correlation
strength, suggesting controllable ways of exploring the copper-doped lead
apatite structural phase diagram. Our results fully reconcile the theoretical
description of the structures of both parent and copper-doped lead apatite with
experiment.

Mechanisms for suppressing thermalization in disorder-free many-body systems,
such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars, have recently
attracted much interest in foundations of quantum statistical physics and
potential quantum information processing applications. However, their
sensitivity to realistic effects such as finite temperature remains largely
unexplored. Here, we have utilized IBM's Kolkata quantum processor to
demonstrate an unexpected robustness of quantum many-body scars at finite
temperatures when the system is prepared in a thermal Gibbs ensemble. We
identify such robustness in the PXP model, which describes quantum many-body
scars in experimental systems of Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold atoms in
tilted Bose--Hubbard optical lattices. By contrast, other theoretical models
which host exact quantum many-body scars are found to lack such robustness, and
their scarring properties quickly decay with temperature. Our study sheds light
on the important differences between scarred models in terms of their algebraic
structures, which impacts their resilience to finite temperature.

<h3>Magnetic imaging and domain nucleation in CrSBr down to the 2D limit</h3>

Recent advancements in 2D materials have revealed the potential of van der
Waals magnets, and specifically of their magnetic anisotropy that allows
applications down to the 2D limit. Among these materials, CrSBr has emerged as
a promising candidate, because its intriguing magnetic and electronic
properties have appeal for both fundamental and applied research in spintronics
or magnonics. Here, nano SQUID-on-tip (SOT) microscopy is used to obtain direct
magnetic imaging of CrSBr flakes with thicknesses ranging from monolayer (N=1)
to few-layer (N=5). The ferromagnetic order is preserved down to the monolayer,
while the antiferromagnetic coupling of the layers starts from the bilayer
case. For odd layers, at zero applied magnetic field, the stray field resulting
from the uncompensated layer is directly imaged. The progressive spin
reorientation along the out-of-plane direction (hard axis) is also measured
with a finite applied magnetic field, allowing to evaluate the anisotropy
constant, which remains stable down to the monolayer and is close to the bulk
value. Finally, by selecting the applied magnetic field protocol, the formation
of N\'eel magnetic domain walls is observed down to the single layer limit.

<h3>Distinct quasiparticle excitations in single-particle spectral function</h3>

Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements have observed a
multi-peak energy structure on the positive bias side in dilute-hole-doped
cuprates, where tightly-bound hole pairs are identified as the building blocks
that can continuously persist into the superconducting regime. In this work, we
study the single-particle spectral function based on a two-hole ground state
wavefunction [Phys. Rev. X 12, 011062 (2022)], which can provide a consistent
understanding of the experimental results. Here the wavefunction structure with
a dichotomy of $d$-wave Cooper pairing and $s$-wave ``twisted hole'' pairing
will lead to two branches in the local spectral function where the low-lying
one corresponds to a conventional nodal quasiparticle, and a higher energy
branch is associated with a ``twisted'' quasiparticle above the pair breaking
or ``pseudogap'' energy. These energies can be further extended into energy
spectra in the momentum space, in which the low-energy dispersion agrees
excellently with the Quantum Monte Carlo numerical result. The implications for
the STM spectra in the superconducting state will also be discussed.

<h3>Tailoring higher-order van Hove singularities in non-Hermitian interface  systems via Floquet engineering</h3>

We propose a non-Hermitian (NH) interface system formed between two NH nodal
line semimetals driven by optical fields as a platform for generation and
tailoring of higher-order van Hove singularities (VHS). Through an analytical
analysis of the density of states (DOS), we find VHS with logarithmic
divergences in the Hermitian limit. Upon introducing NH terms, four exceptional
rings on two sides of the Fermi line are formed. By tuning the NH parameters
and the light amplitude, we find a situation when one exceptional ring crosses
the Fermi line, where a saddle point appears and results in a paired VHS around
the origin. In contrast, when an exceptional contour resides at the Fermi
energy, the saddle points critically get destroyed and we obtain a single peak
in the DOS, with power-law divergences. These higher-order divergences that
appear in an NH system have a different origin than that of the higher-order
VHS in Hermitian systems, where no saddle point merging is noted. Our results
suggest NH interfaces to be promising avenues for exploring higher-order VHS.

<h3>Constraints between entropy production and its fluctuations in  nonthermal engines</h3>

We analyze a mesoscopic conductor autonomously performing a thermodynamically
useful task, such as cooling or producing electrical power, in a part of the
system -- the working substance -- by exploiting another terminal or set of
terminals -- the resource -- that contains a stationary nonthermal
(nonequilibrium) distribution. Thanks to the nonthermal properties of the
resource, on average no exchange of particles or energy with the working
substance is required to fulfill the task. This resembles the action of a
demon, as long as only average quantities are considered. Here, we go beyond a
description based on average currents and investigate the role of fluctuations
in such a system. We show that a minimum level of entropy fluctuations in the
system is necessary, whenever one is exploiting a certain entropy production in
the resource terminal to perform a useful task in the working substance. For
concrete implementations of the demonic nonthermal engine in three- and
four-terminal electronic conductors in the quantum Hall regime, we compare the
resource fluctuations to the entropy production in the resource and to the
useful engine output (produced power or cooling power).

<h3>Evidence of thermodynamic driving forces in the contact charging of  insulating polymers</h3>

<br>
Contact electrification, or contact charging, refers to the process of static
charge accumulation after rubbing, or even simple touching, of two materials.
Despite its relevance in static electricity, various natural phenomena, and
numerous technologies, contact charging remains poorly understood. For
insulating materials, even the species of charge carrier may be unknown, and
the direction of charge-transfer lacks firm molecular-level explanation. We use
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate whether thermodynamics
can explain contact charging between insulating polymers. Building on prior
work implicating water-ions (e.g., hydronium and hydroxide) as potential charge
carriers, we predict preferred directions of charge-transfer between polymer
surfaces according to the free energy of water-ions within water droplets on
such surfaces. Broad agreement between our predictions and experimental
triboelectric series indicate that thermodynamically driven ion-transfer likely
influences contact charging of polymers. Importantly, simulation analyses
reveal how specific interactions of water and water-ions proximate to the
polymer-water interface explains observed trends. This study establishes
relevance of thermodynamic driving forces in contact charging of insulators
with new evidence informed by molecular-level interactions. These insights have
direct implications for future mechanistic studies and applications of contact
charging involving polymeric materials.

<h3>Superconducting triangular islands as a platform for manipulating  Majorana zero modes</h3>

Current proposals for topological quantum computation (TQC) based on Majorana
zero modes (MZM) have mostly been focused on coupled-wire architecture which
can be challenging to implement experimentally. To explore alternative building
blocks of TQC, in this work we study the possibility of obtaining robust MZM at
the corners of triangular superconducting islands, which often appear
spontaneously in epitaxial growth. We first show that a minimal three-site
triangle model of spinless $p$-wave superconductor allows MZM to appear at
different pairs of vertices controlled by a staggered vector potential, which
may be realized using coupled quantum dots and can already demonstrate
braiding. For systems with less fine-tuned parameters, we suggest an
alternative structure of a "hollow" triangle subject to uniform supercurrents
or vector potentials, in which MZM generally appear when two of the edges are
in a different topological phase from the third. We also discuss the
feasibility of constructing the triangles using existing candidate MZM systems
and of braiding more MZM in networks of such triangles.

<h3>Spatially Inhomogeneous Linear and Nonlinear Electromagnetic Response in  Periodic Solids: A General Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11658</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear electromagnetic response functions have reemerged as a crucial tool
for studying quantum materials. Most attention has been paid to responses to
spatially uniform electric fields, relevant to optical experiments in
conventional materials. However, magnetic and magnetoelectric phenomena are
naturally connected by responses to spatially varying electric fields due to
Maxwell's equations. Furthermore, in moir\'{e} materials, characteristic
lattice scales are much longer, allowing spatial variation of optical electric
fields to potentially have a measurable effect in experiments. To address these
issues, we develop a formalism for computing linear and nonlinear responses to
spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields. Starting with the continuity
equation, we derive an expression for the second-quantized current operator
that is manifestly conserved and model independent. Crucially, our formalism
makes no assumptions on the form of the microscopic Hamiltonian and so is
applicable to model Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding or ab initio
calculations. We then develop a diagrammatic Kubo formalism for computing the
wavevector dependence of linear and nonlinear conductivities, using Ward
identities to fix the value of the diamagnetic current order-by-order in the
vector potential. We apply our formula to compute the magnitude of the Kerr
effect at oblique incidence for a model of a moir\'{e} Chern insulator and
demonstrate the experimental importance of spatially inhomogeneous fields in
these systems. We further show how our formalism allows us to compute the
(orbital) magnetic multipole moments and magnetic susceptibilities in
insulators. We next use our formalism to compute the second-order transverse
response to spatially varying transverse electric fields in our moir\'{e} Chern
insulator model, with an eye towards the next generation of experiments in
these systems.

<h3>Non-Hermitian superfluid--Mott-insulator transition in the  one-dimensional zigzag bosonic chains</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigated the behavior of non-Hermitian bosonic gases with Hubbard
interactions in the one-dimensional zigzag optical lattices through the
calculation of dynamic response functions. Our findings showed the existence of
a non-Hermitian quantum phase transition that is dependent on the
pseudo-Hermitian symmetry. The system tends to exhibit a superfluid phase, when
subjected to weak dissipation. While under strong dissipation, the
pseudo-Hermitian symmetry of the system is partially broken, leading to a
transition towards a normal liquid phase. As the dissipation increases beyond
the critical threshold, the pseudo-Hermitian symmetry is completely broken,
resulting in a Mott-insulator phase. We propose an experimental setup using
one-dimensional zigzag optical lattices containing two-electron atoms to
realize this system. Our research emphasizes the key role of non-Hermiticity in
quantum phase transitions and offers a new theoretical framework as well as
experimental methods for understanding the behavior of dissipative quantum
systems, implicating significant development of new quantum devices and
technologies.

<h3>Topological Floquet Flat Bands in Irradiated Alternating Twist  Multilayer Graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the appearance of topological Floquet flat bands in
alternating-twist multilayer graphene (ATMG) which has an alternating relative
twist angle $\pm\theta$ near the first magic angle. While the system hosts both
flat bands and a steep Dirac cone in the static case, the circularly polarized
laser beam can open a gap at the Moir\'{e} $K$ point and create Floquet flat
bands carrying non-zero Chern numbers. Considering the recent
lattice-relaxation results, we find that the topological flat band is
well-isolated for the effective interlayer tunneling in $n=3, 4, 5$ layer. Such
dynamically produced topological flat bands are potentially observed in the
experiment and thus provide a feasible way to realize the fractional Chern
insulator.

<h3>Thermoelectric effect in kagome lattice enhanced at van Hove  singularities</h3>

<i>Kaiki Shibata, Naoya Yamaguchi, Hikaru Sawahata, Fumiyuki Ishii</i>
<br>
<br>
We have performed first-principles calculations using density functional
theory on a kagome lattice model with a chiral spin state, as a representative
example demonstrating significant longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric
properties. The results revealed that the saddle-point-type van Hove
singularity (VHS) enhances thermoelectric effects. The longitudinal
thermoelectric conductivity $\alpha_{xx}$ was large at the chemical potentials
tuned close to the band at the symmetry points, K (lower band edge), $\Gamma$
(upper band edge), and M (saddle point), where the VHSs of the density of
states (DOS) were at the corresponding band energies. The transverse
thermoelectric conductivity $\alpha_{xy}$ was large at the chemical potential
of saddle-point-type VHS. A large anomalous Nernst coefficient of about 10
$\mu$V/K at 50 K was expected.

<h3>A local criterion of topological phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11738" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11738</a>
<br>
<i>Yangfan Hu</i>
<br>
<br>
A local criterion of topological phase transitions is established based on
the Morse theory: a topological phase transition occurs when the count of Morse
critical points of the order function changes. The locations in space where
this change occurs are referred to as spatial critical points of the
topological phase transition. In cases of continuous topological phase
transitions, these spatial critical points are identified through the emergence
of degenerate Morse critical points, where local maxima and minima of the order
function split or merge. This resembles the formation and annihilation of a
particle-antiparticle pair. The wide-ranging applicability of this criterion is
demonstrated through three case studies that explore topological phase
transitions in both configuration space and reciprocal space. Every topological
phase transition is linked to a localized physical process that cannot be
comprehended solely by studying changes in a global quantity, such as a
topological invariant.

<br>
<br>
The phenomenon of self-assembly of constituent elements to form molecules at
low temperatures appears ubiquitously in transition metal compounds with
orbital degrees of freedom. Recent progress in local structure studies using
synchrotron radiation x-rays is shifting the interest in structural studies in
such molecule-forming systems from the low-temperature ordered phase to the
short-range order that appears like a precursor at high temperatures. In this
study, we discuss both experimentally and theoretically the relationship
between the trimer structure that appears in the layered LiV$X_2$ ($X$ = O, S,
Se) system with a two-dimensional triangular lattice of vanadium and the zigzag
chain-like local structure that appears near the phase transition boundary
where molecular formation occurs. The vanadium trimerization that persistently
appears in both low-temperature phases of LiVO$_2$ and LiVS$_2$ disappears in
LiVSe$_2$, and a regular triangular lattice is thought to be realized in
LiVSe$_2$, but this study reveals that the zigzag chain local distortion
appears with a finite correlation length. This zigzag chain state local
distortions are similar to the motif of local distortions in the
high-temperature phase of LiVS$_2$, indicating that the local distortions are
persistent away from the trimer phase transition boundary. On the other hand,
it is concluded that the zigzag chain order appearing in LiVSe$_2$ is more
stable than that in LiVS$_2$ in terms of the temperature variation of atomic
displacement and correlation length. The zigzag chain order is considered to be
competitive with the trimer order appearing in the LiV$X_2$ system. In this
paper, we discuss the similarities and differences between the parameters that
stabilize these electronic phases and the local distortions that appear in
other molecular formation systems.

<br>
Monte Carlo techniques play a central role in statistical mechanics
approaches for connecting macroscopic thermodynamic and kinetic properties to
the electronic structure of a material. This paper describes the implementation
of Monte Carlo techniques for the study multicomponent crystalline materials
within the Clusters Approach to Statistical Mechanics (CASM) software suite,
and demonstrates their use in model systems to calculate free energies and
kinetic coefficients, study phase transitions, and construct first-principles
based phase diagrams. Many crystal structures are complex, with multiple
sublattices occupied by differing sets of chemical species, along with the
presence of vacancies or interstitial species. This imposes constraints on
concentration variables, the form of thermodynamic potentials, and the values
of kinetic transport coefficients. The framework used by CASM to formulate
thermodynamic potentials and kinetic transport coefficients accounting for
arbitrarily complex crystal structures is presented and demonstrated with
examples applying it to crystal systems of increasing complexity. Additionally,
a new software package is introduced, casm-flow, which helps automate the
setup, submission, management, and analysis of Monte Carlo simulations
performed using CASM.

<h3>Unexpected Reversed Piezoelectric Response in Elemental Sb and Bi  Monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11762" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11762</a>

<i>Yunfei Hong, Junkai Deng, Qi Kong, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Sun, Jefferson Zhe Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Sb and Bi monolayers, as single-elemental ferroelectric materials with
similar atomic structure, hold intrinsic piezoelectricity theoretically, which
makes them highly promising for applications in functional nano-devices such as
sensors and actuators. Here, using first-principles calculations, we
systematically explore the piezoelectric response of Sb and Bi monolayers. Our
findings reveal that Sb exhibits a negative piezoelectric response, whereas Bi
displays a positive one. This discrepancy is attributed to the dominant role of
different atomic internal distortions (internal-strain terms) in response to
applied strain. Further electron-density distribution analysis reveals that the
atomic bonding in Sb tends to be covalent, while the atomic bonding in Bi leans
more towards ionic. Compared to the Sb monolayer, the Bi monolayer is
distinguished by its more pronounced lone-pair orbitals electrons and
associated larger Born effective charges. The Coulomb repulsions between
lone-pair orbitals electrons and the chemical bonds lead to the Bi monolayer
possessing more prominent atomic folds and, consequently, more significant
atomic distortion in the z-direction under strain. These differences result in
a considerable difference in internal-strain terms, ultimately leading to the
reversed piezoelectric response between Sb and Bi monolayers. The present work
provides valuable insights into the piezoelectric mechanism of 2D ferroelectric
materials and their potential applications in nano-electronic devices.

<h3>A Series Expansion Study for Large Negative Quantum Renormalization of  Magnon Spectra in the $S=1/2$ Kagome-Lattice Heisenberg Antiferromagnet  Cs$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$SnF$_{12}$</h3>

The series expansion method is used to study magnon spectra of the kagome
system with nearest-neighbor exchange interaction $J$ and out-of-plane
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction $D^{\parallel}$, which is a minimal
model for Cs$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$SnF$_{12}$. Compared to the magnon spectra by the
linear spin wave (LSW) theory, we find that dispersions at high energy part
suffer downward deformation, which is similar to the triangle lattice case, in
addition to the reduction of the energy scale of about 40\% as pointed out in a
neutron-scattering study by Ono {\it et al.} Using a reliable estimation

Cs$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$SnF$_{12}$, we use $D^{\parallel}$ as the fitting parameter to
reproduce the experimental magnon spectra and obtain $D^{\parallel}=0.12J$. We
also report that a roton-like minimum occurs at the M point and a maximum at
points somewhat away from the $\Gamma$ point. Compression of the LSW magnon
band is commonly seen in the kagome and triangular-lattice systems, which may
be viewed as being pushed from above by the spinon continuum.

The quest to understand the nature of superconductivity in cuprates has
spotlighted the pair density wave (PDW) -- a superconducting state
characterized by a spatially modulated order parameter. Despite significant
advances in understanding PDW properties, conclusively demonstrating its
presence in systems pertinent to cuprate superconductors remains elusive. In
this study, we present a systematic density-matrix renormalization group study
to investigate the Emery model (or the three-band Hubbard model) on two-leg
square cylinders with negative electron hopping term $t_{pp}$ between adjacent
oxygen sites. Kinetic frustration - introduced by changing the sign of
oxygen-oxygen hopping - leads to a much reduced Cu-Cu antiferromagnetic
exchange along with an enlarged charge transfer energy that changes the local
properties of the model. At light doping levels, our findings reveal a ground
state remarkably consistent with a PDW, exhibiting mutually commensurate
superconducting (SC), charge and spin density wave correlations. Intriguingly,
the dominant SC pairing is observed between neighboring oxygen sites, diverging
from the expected Cu sites in the positive $t_{pp}$ case. When the system
incorporates moderate near-neighbor interactions, particularly an attractive
$V_{pp}$ between adjacent oxygen sites, the SC correlations become
quasi-long-ranged, accompanied by a pronounced divergence in the PDW
susceptibility. When further increase the attractive $V_{pp}$, the system gives
ways to an unconventional $d$-wave superconductivity.

Hydrogels are promising systems for separation applications due to their
structural characteristics (i.e. hydrophilicity and porosity). In our study, we
investigate the permeation of suspensions of rigid latex particles of different
sizes through free-standing hydrogel membranes prepared by photopolymerization
of a mixture of poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and large poly
(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains of 300 000 g.mol-1 in the presence of a
photoinitiator. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cryoscanning electron
microscopy (cryoSEM) were employed to characterize the structure of the
hydrogel membranes. We find that the 20 nm particle permeation depends on both
the PEGDA/PEG composition and the pressure applied during filtration. In
contrast, we do not measure a significant permeation of the 100 nm and 1 $\mu$m
particles, despite the presence of large cavities of 1 $\mu$m evidenced by
cryoSEM images. We suggest that the PEG chains induce local nanoscale defects
in the cross-linking of PEGDA-rich walls separating the micron size cavities,
that control the permeation of particles and water. Moreover, we discuss the
decline of the permeation flux observed in the presence of latex particles,
compared to that of pure water. We suggest that a thin layer of particles forms
on the surface of the hydrogels.

<h3>Microscopic contributions to the entropy production at all times: From  nonequilibrium steady states to global thermalization</h3>

Based on exact integration of the Schr\"odinger equation, we numerically
study microscopic contributions to the entropy production for the single
electron transistor, a paradigmatic model describing a single Fermi level
tunnel coupled to two baths of free fermions. To this end, we decompose the
entropy production into a sum of information theoretic terms and study them
across all relevant time scales, including the nonequilibrium steady state
regime and the final stage of global thermalization. We find that the entropy
production is dominated for most times by microscopic deviations from
thermality in the baths and the correlation between (but not inside) the baths.
Despite these microscopic deviations from thermality, the temperatures and
chemical potentials of the baths thermalize as expected, even though our model
is integrable. Importantly, this observation is confirmed for both initially
mixed and pure states. We further observe that the bath-bath correlations are
quite insensitive to the system-bath coupling strength contrary to intuition.
Finally, the system-bath correlation, small in an absolute sense, dominates in
a relative sense and displays pure quantum correlations for all studied
parameter regimes.

<h3>Quantum Annealing in Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass in Presence of  Time-Dependent Longitudinal Field</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent development of quantum technology using quantum
annealing technique and the recent works on the static properties of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, we study quantum annealing of
the spin glass model by tuning both transverse and longitudinal fields. We
solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of the total Hamiltonian when
both the fields are made time-dependent and eventually vanish at the same time.
We have computed the time-evolution of the probability of finding the system in
one of two degenerate ground states of the classical spin glass. At the end of
annealing, using the configuration averaged probability, we have shown a clear
advantage while the longitudinal field is annealed rather than keeping it
constant throughout the process of quantum annealing. We further investigate
the order parameter distribution of a quantum SK spin glass in presence of a
small longitudinal field and indicate the speeding up of the ergodicity as
compared to the zero longitudinal field case. Our speculation is that this
emergent ergodicity is responsible for the advantage in quantum annealing with
annealed longitudinal field.

Anisotropic hybrid nanostructures stand out as promising therapeutic agents
in photothermal conversion-based treatments. Accordingly, understanding local
heat generation mediated by light-to-heat conversion of absorbing
multicomponent nanoparticles at the single particle level have both forthwith
become a subject of broad and current interest. Nonetheless, evaluating
reliable temperature profiles around a single trapped nanoparticle is
challenging from all experimental, computational, and fundamental viewpoints.
Committed to filling this gap, the heat generation of an anisotropic hybrid
nanostructure is explored by means of two different experimental approaches
from which the local temperature is measured in a direct or indirect way, all
in the context of the hot Brownian motion theory. The results were compared
with analytical results supported by the numerical computation of the
wavelength-dependent absorption efficiencies in the discrete dipole
approximation for scattering calculations, which has been here extended to
inhomogeneous nanostructures. Overall, we provide a consistent and
comprehensive view of the heat generation in optical traps of highly absorbing
particles under the viewpoint of the hot Brownian motion theory.

<h3>Tuning brittleness in multi-component metallic glasses through chemical  disorder aging</h3>

Shear localization in slowly-driven bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is typically
accompanied by a sharp drop in the bulk stress response as a signature of the
plastic yielding transition. It is also observed that the sharpness of this
elastic-plastic dynamical transition depends on the extent of local chemical
and microstructural orders, as well as the glass preparation protocol ( ie.
thermal annealing). Here, we investigate sheared multi-element BMGs in
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and demonstrate that glass aging,
implemented through a hybrid Monte-Carlo(MC)-MD process, sharpens the
elastic-plastic transition through a distinct crossover, seen in strain
patterns that gradually shift from diffuse features in as-quenched samples to
localized (yet system-spanning) patterns in well-annealed glasses. This effect
of glass aging on the elastic-plastic transition is found to be correlated to
the inherent interplay between aging-induced icosahedra ordering and
co-operative formation of shear transformation zones. The observed crossover is
quantified through a measure of the age-dependent susceptibility to plastic
rearrangements, exhibiting strong (anti-)correlations to local ordering
features, and the corresponding spatial correlation length grows with the aging
timescale.

<h3>Cuprate universal electronic spin response and the pseudogap from NMR</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11874" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11874</a>

<i>Daniel Bandur, Jakob Nachtigal, Stefan Tsankov, Abigail Lee, Juergen Haase</i>
<br>
<br>
It is shown that three independently measured NMR shifts in the cuprates in
their whole temperature dependence are linearly related to each other with a
doping and family dependent, but temperature independent constant. It is the Cu
shift anisotropy that changes in proportion to the planar O shift for all
materials found in the literature, independent of sample origin or details of
the measurements. Such a relation involving three shifts rules out a single
spin component description of the cuprates. It is argued that the relation is
so robust since it depends for Cu on ($A_\perp-A_\parallel$), the hyperfine
coefficient $A_\alpha$ for the Cu $3d(x^2-y^2)$ hole, and not on the isotropic
Cu term $B$ from transferred spin. The Cu $3d(x^2-y^2)$ spin together with a
second spin that determines the planar O shift can explain the data. For
overdoped metallic samples, both become temperature dependent only at the
critical temperature of superconductivity, $T_\mathrm{c}$, where both begin to
decrease. However, the Cu spin component turns increasingly negative until the
second spin has disappeared. In the presence of a small pseudogap the onset
temperature of this process coincides with the onset of the temperature
dependence of the shifts, which is now above $T_\mathrm{c}$. As the pseudogap
increases further, the behavior does not change even as $T_\mathrm{c}$ begins
to decrease again. The temperature independent constant in the linear
relationship describing the negative spin is related to the size of the
uncoupled spin components and depends on the planar oxygen hole content that is
known to correlate with the maximum $T_\mathrm{c}$. The Cu spin component does
not appear to carry significant entropy as the nuclear relaxation ceases in the
condensed state.

<h3>Conformal field theory approach to parton fractional quantum Hall trial  wave functions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11910</a>
<br>
<i>Greg J. Henderson, G. J. Sreejith, Steven H. Simon</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that all lowest Landau level projected and unprojected chiral parton
type fractional quantum Hall ground and edge state trial wave functions, which
take the form of products of integer quantum Hall wave functions, can be
expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlation functions, where we can
associate a chiral algebra to each state which defines a CFT that is the
``smallest'' such CFT that can generate the corresponding ground and edge state
trial wave functions. A field-theoretic generalisation of Laughlin's plasma
analogy, known as generalised screening, is formulated for these states. If
this holds, along with an additional assumption, we argue that the inner
products of edge state trial wave functions, for parton states with a unique
densest wave function, can be expressed as matrix elements of an exponentiated
local action operator of the CFT, generalising the result of Dubail et al. [PRB
85, 11531 (2012)], which implies the equality between edge state and
entanglement level counting to state counting in the CFT. We numerically test
this result in the case of the unprojected $\nu = 2/5$ composite fermion state
and the bosonic $\nu = 1$ $\phi_2^2$ parton state. We discuss how Read's
arguments [PRB 79, 045308 (2009)] still apply, implying that conformal blocks
of the CFT defined by the given chiral algebra are valid quasi-hole trial wave
functions, with the adiabatic braiding statistics given by the monodromy of
these functions. It is shown that all chiral composite fermion wave functions
can be expressed as CFT correlation functions without explicit symmetrisation
and that the ground, edge, and quasi-hole trial wave functions of the
$\phi_n^m$ parton states can be expressed as the conformal blocks of the $U(1)
\otimes SU(n)_m$ WZW models. We discuss the $\phi_2^k$ series in detail, where
several examples of quasi-hole braiding statistics calculations are given.

An effective quantum field theory of the 2D Hubbard model on a square lattice
near half-filling is presented and studied. This effective model describes
so-called nodal and antinodal fermions, and it is derived from the lattice
model using a certain partial continuum limit. It is shown that the nodal
fermions can be bosonized, which leads to spin-charge separation and a 2D
analogue of a Wess-Zumino-Witten model. A bosonization formula for the nodal
fermion field operator is obtained, and an exactly solvable model of
interacting 2D fermions is identified. Different ways of treating the antinodal
fermions are also proposed.

We report a detailed investigation of the magnetic order in 192 stable
magnetic two-dimensional materials from the Computational 2D Materials Database
having one magnetic atom in the unit cell. The calculations are based on a
systematic workflow that employs spin spiral calculations and yields the
magnetic order in terms of a two-dimensional ordering vector $\mathbf{Q}$. We
then include spin-orbit coupling to extract the easy and hard axes for
collinear structures and the orientation of spiral planes in non-collinear
structures. Finally, for all predicted ferromagnets we compute the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and determine whether or not these are
strong enough to overcome the magnetic anisotropy and stabilise a chiral spin
spiral ground state. These steps completely determines the ground state order
within the spiralling ansatz. We find 58 ferromagnets, 21 collinear
anti-ferromagnets, and 85 non-collinear ground states of which 15 are chiral
spin spirals driven by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The results show
that non-collinear order is in fact as common as collinear order in these
materials and emphasise the need for detailed investigation of the magnetic
ground state when reporting magnetic properties of new materials. Furthermore,
non-collinear order typically breaks symmetries inherent to the lattice and may
give rise to emergent properties such as multiferroicity, magnetoelectricity or
second order optical effects that would be predicted as absent based on a
collinear assumption.

Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is a strongly-correlated material that exhibits
insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) near room temperature, which makes it a
promising candidate for applications in nanophotonics or optoelectronics.
However, creating VO$_2$ nanostructures with the desired functionality can be
challenging due to microscopic inhomogeneities that can significantly impact
the local optical and electronic properties. Thin lamellas, produced by focused
ion beam milling from a homogeneous layer, provide a useful prototype for
studying VO$_2$ at the truly microscopic level using a scanning transmission
electron microscope (STEM). High-resolution imaging is used to identify
structural inhomogeneities while electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)
supported by statistical analysis helps to detect V$_x$O$_y$ stoichiometries
with a reduced oxidation number of vanadium at the areas of thickness below 70
nm. On the other hand, the thicker areas are dominated by vanadium dioxide,
where the signatures of IMT are detected in both core-loss and low-loss EELS
experiments with in-situ heating. The experimental results are interpreted with
ab-initio and semi-classical calculations. This work shows that structural
inhomogeneities such as pores and cracks present no harm to the desired optical
properties of VO$_2$ samples.

<br>
<br>
Solid phase epitaxy is a crystallization technique used to produce high
quality thin films. Lateral solid phase epitaxy furthermore enables the
realization of non-planar structures, which are interesting, e.g., in the field
of spintronics. Here, we demonstrate lateral solid phase epitaxy of yttrium
iron garnet over an artificial edge, such that the crystallization direction is
perpendicular to the initial seed. We use single crystalline garnet seed
substrates partially covered by a \ch{SiO_x} film to study the lateral
crystallization over the \ch{SiO_x} mesa. The yttrium iron garnet layer retains
the crystal orientation of the substrate not only when in direct contact with
the substrate, but also across the edge on top of the \ch{SiO_x} mesa. By
controlling the crystallization dynamics it is possible to almost completely
suppress the formation of polycrystals and to enable epitaxial growth of single
crystalline yttrium iron garnet on top of mesas made from arbitrary materials.
From a series of annealing experiments, we extract an activation energy of
\SI{2.8}{eV} and a velocity prefactor of \SI{5.1e13}{nm/s} for the lateral
epitaxial crystallization along the <$100$> direction. Our results pave the way
to engineer single crystalline non-planar yttrium iron garnet structures with
controlled crystal orientation.

This letter investigates low frequency 1/ f noise in hBN encapsulated
graphene device in a dual gated geometry. The noise study is performed as a
function of top gate carrier density (nT G) at different back gate densities
(nBG). The noise at low nBG is found to be independent of top gate carrier
density. With increasing nBG, noise value increases and a noise peak is
observed near charge inhomogeneity of the device. Further increase in nBG leads
to decrease in noise magnitude. The shape of the noise is found to be closely
related to charge inhomogeneity region of the device. Moreover, the noise and
conductivity data near charge neutrality shows clear evidence of noise
emanating from combination of charge number and mobility fluctuation

We study the effect of a local potential shift induced by a side electrode on
the edge modes at the boundary between gapped and ungapped bilayer graphene. A
potential shift close to the gapped-ungapped boundary causes the emergence of
unprotected edge modes, propagating in both directions along the boundary.
These counterpropagating edge modes allow edge backscattering, as opposed to
the case of valley-momentum-locked edge modes. We then calculate the
conductance of a bilayer graphene wire in presence of finger-gate electrodes,
finding strong asymmetries with energy inversion and deviations from
conductance quantization that can be understood with the gate-induced
unprotected edge modes.

<h3>VO$_2$ under hydrostatic pressure: Isostructural phase transition close  to a critical end-point</h3>

<br>
<br>
The high-pressure behavior of monoclinic VO$_2$ is revisited by a combination
of Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction on a single crystal under
hydrostatic conditions at room temperature. A soft mode is observed up to P$_c$
= 13.9(1) GPa. At this pressure, an isostructural phase transition between two
monoclinic phases M$_1$ and M$_1$' hinders this instability. The features of
this transformation (no apparent volume jump) indicate that the compression at
ambient temperature passes close to a critical point. An analysis based on the
Landau theory of phase transitions gives a complete description of the P-T
phase diagram. The M1' is characterized by spontaneous displacements of the
oxygen sub-lattice without any strong modification of the VV dimers distances
nor the twist angle of vanadium chains. The spontaneous displacements of oxygen
and the spontaneous deformations of the ($b_{M1}$, $c_{M1}$) plane follow the
same quadratic dependence with pressure and scales with spontaneous shifts of
the Raman phonons located at 225, 260 and 310 cm$^{-1}$. Pressure-induced
shifts of the Raman peaks allows for new assignment of several Raman modes. In
particular, the A$_g$(1)+B$_g$(1) modes at 145 cm$^{-1}$ are identified as the
vanadium displacive phonons. A second transformation in the metallic phase X,
which is found triclinic (P$\bar1$) is observed starting at 32 GPa, with a wide
coexistence region (up to 42 GPa). Upon decompression, phase X transforms,
between 20 GPa and 3 GPa, to another phase that is neither the M$_1$' nor M$_1$
phase. The structural transitions identified under pressure match with all the
previously reported electronic modifications confirming that lattice and
electronic degrees of freedom are closely coupled in this correlated material.

The formation of persistent charge currents in mesoscopic systems remains an
interesting and actual topic of condensed matter research. Here, we analyze the
formation of spontaneous arising persistent currents of charged fermions in
2-dimensional electron-hole ribbons on the top and bottom of a 3-dimensional
topological insulator. In such a device the two-dimensional Dirac fermions with
opposite chiralities are spatially separated that allows these currents to flow
in the opposite directions without compensating each other. The nature of this
phenomenon is based on the interference of the quasiparticle quantum waves
which are scattered with asymmetric scattering phases at the lateral n-p chiral
junction and then reflected back by the external boundaries of the ribbon. As a
result quasiparticles in the ribbon are shown to be in unified electron-hole
quantum states carrying the persistent current.

Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have emerged as powerful quantum
simulators of translationally invariant systems with many applications in e.g.
strongly-correlated and topological systems. However, the ability to locally
tune all Hamiltonian parameters remains an outstanding goal that would enable
the simulation of a wider range of quantum phenomena. Motivated by recent
advances in quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezers, we here show
theoretically how local control over individual tunnelling links in an optical
lattice can be achieved by incorporating local time-periodic potentials. We
propose to periodically modulate the on-site energy of individual lattice sites
and employ Floquet theory to demonstrate how this can result in full individual
control over the tunnelling amplitudes in one dimension. We provide various
example configurations realising interesting topological models such as
extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models that would be challenging to realize by
other means. Extending to two dimensions, we present that local periodic
driving in a three-site plaquette allows for full simultaneous control over the
relative tunnelling amplitudes and the gauge-invariant flux piercing the
plaquette, providing a clear stepping stone in building a fully programmable 2D
tight-binding model. This local modulation scheme is applicable to many
different lattice geometries.

Nonmagnetic impurity scattering is known to shift up the Ginzburg-Landau
parameter $\kappa$ of a superconductor. In this case, when the system is
initially in type I, it can change its magnetic response, crossing the
intertype domain with $\kappa \sim 1$ between the two standard
superconductivity types and arriving at type II. In the present work we
demonstrate that the impact of disorder can be much more profound in the
presence of the multiband structure of the charge carrier states. In
particular, when the band diffusivities differ from each other, the intertype
domain tends to expand significantly, including points with $\kappa \gg 1$ that
belong to deep type-II in conventional single-band superconductors. Our finding
sheds light on the nontrivial disorder effect and significantly complements
earlier results on the enlargement of the intertype domain in clean multiband
superconductors.

Spectral data is routinely broadened in order to improve appearance,
approximate a higher sampling level or model experimental measurement effects.
While there has been extensive work in the signal processing field to develop
efficient methods for the application of fixed-width broadening functions,
these are not suitable for all scientific applications -- for example, the
instrumental resolution of inelastic neutron scattering measurements varies
along the energy-transfer axis. Na\"ive application of a kernel to every point
has $O(N \times M)$ complexity and scales poorly for a high-resolution spectrum
over many data points. Here we present an approximate method with complexity
$O(N + W\times M \log M)$, where $W$ scales with the range of required
broadening widths; in practice the number and cost of mathematical operations
is drastically reduced to $N$ polynomial evaluations and a modest number of
discrete Fourier transforms. Applications are demonstrated for Gaussian
interpolation of density-of-states data and to instrumental resolution
functions. We anticipate that these performance improvements will assist
application of resolution functions inside fitting procedures and interactive
tools.

Dynamical correlations and non-local contributions beyond static mean-field
theories are of fundamental importance for describing the electronic structure
of correlated metals. Their effects are usually described with many-body
approaches and non-local dynamical self-energies. We suggest here a class of
simple model self-energies that are a generalization of the static DFT +
Hubbard approach. This formulation, for simplicity called DFT+U({\omega})+V,
provides an intuitive physical picture, a lightweight implementation, and
displays very good agreement with experimental data.

<h3>A new generation of effective core potentials: selected Lanthanides and  heavy elements</h3>

<br>
We construct correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for a
selected set of heavy atoms and f-elements that are of significant current
interest in materials and chemical applications, including Y, Zr, Nb, Rh, Ta,
Re, Pt, Gd, and Tb. As customary, ccECPs consist of spin-orbit averaged
relativistic effective potential (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms.
For the AREP part, our constructions are carried out within a relativistic
coupled-cluster framework while also taking into objective function
one-particle characteristics for improved convergence in optimizations. The
transferability is adjusted using binding curves of hydride and oxide
molecules. We address the difficulties encountered with f-elements, such as the
presence of large cores and multiple near-degeneracies of excited levels. For
these elements, we construct ccECPs with core-valence partitioning that
includes 4f-subshell in the valence space. The developed ccECPs achieve an
excellent balance between accuracy, size of the valence space, and
transferability and are also suitable to be used in plane wave codes with
reasonable energy cutoffs.

<br>
<br>
The vastness of the space of possible multicomponent metal alloys is hoped to
provide improved structural materials but also challenges traditional,
low-throughput materials design efforts. Computational screening could narrow
this search space if models for materials stability and desired properties
exist that are sufficiently inexpensive and accurate to efficiently guide
experiments. Towards this effort, here we develop a method to rapidly assess
the thermodynamic stability of a metal alloy composition of arbitrary number of
elements, stoichiometry, and temperature based on density functional theory
(DFT) data. In our model, the Gibbs free energy of the solid solution contains
binary enthalpy contributions and ideal configurational entropy, whereas only
enthalpy is considered for intermetallic competing phases. Compared to a past
model for predicting the formation of single-phase high-entropy alloys [Phys.
Rev. X 5, 011041 (2015)], our method is similarly inexpensive, since it
assesses enthalpies based on existing DFT data, but less heuristic, more
broadly applicable, and more accurate (70--75%) compared to experiment.

Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy is becoming a premier
method for the nanoscale optical investigation of materials well beyond the
diffraction limit. A number of popular numerical methods exist to predict the
near-field contrast for axisymmetric configurations of scatterers on a surface
in the quasi-electrostatic approximation. Here, a fully electrodynamic approach
is given for the calculation of near-field contrast of several scatterers in
arbitrary configuration, based on the generalized Mie scattering method.
Examples for the potential of this new approach are given by showing the
coupling of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride layers and
showing enhanced scattering in core-shell systems. In general, this method
enables the numerical calculation of the near-field contrast in a variety of
strongly resonant scatterers and is able to accurately recreate spatial
near-field maps.

<h3>Dynamical percolation transition in vegetation patterns from satellite  images</h3>

We analyze the vegetation growth dynamics with a stochastic cellular automata
model and in real-world data obtained from satellite images. We look for areas
where vegetation breaks down into clusters, comparing it to a percolation
transition that happens in the cellular automata model and is an early warning
signal of land degradation. We use satellite imagery data such as the
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). We
consider the periodic effect of seasons as a periodic environmental stress, and
show numerically how the vegetation can be resilient to high stress during
seasonal fluctuations. We qualitatively recognize these effects in real-world
vegetation images. Finally, we qualitatively evaluate the environmental stress
in land images by considering both the vegetation density and its
clusterization.

<h3>Electrical operation of hole spin qubits in planar MOS silicon quantum  dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
Silicon hole quantum dots have been the subject of considerable attention
thanks to their strong spin-orbit coupling enabling electrical control. The
physics of silicon holes is qualitatively different from germanium holes and
requires a separate theoretical description. In this work, we theoretically
study the electrical control and coherence properties of silicon hole dots with
different magnetic field orientations. We discuss possible experimental
configurations to optimize the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) Rabi time,
the phonon relaxation time, and the dephasing due to random telegraph noise.
Our main findings are: (i) The in-plane $g$-factor is strongly influenced by
the presence of the split-off band, as well as by any shear strain. The
$g$-factor is a non-monotonic function of the top gate electric field, in
agreement with recent experiments. This enables coherence sweet spots at
specific values of the top gate field and specific magnetic field orientations.
(ii) Even a small ellipticity (aspect ratios $\sim 1.2$) causes significant
anisotropy in the in-plane $g$-factor, which can vary by $50\% - 100\%$ as the
magnetic field is rotated in the plane. (iii) EDSR Rabi frequencies are
comparable to Ge, and the ratio between the relaxation time and the EDSR Rabi
time $\sim 10^5$. For an out-of-plane magnetic field the EDSR Rabi frequency is
anisotropic with respect to the orientation of the driving electric field,
varying by $\approx 20\%$ as the driving field is rotated in the plane. Our
work aims to stimulate experiments by providing guidelines on optimizing
configurations and geometries to achieve robust, fast and long-lived hole spin
qubits in silicon.

<h3>Thermodynamically Informed Priors for Uncertainty Propagation in  First-Principles Statistical Mechanics</h3>

This work demonstrates how first-principles thermodynamic research within a
Bayesian framework can quantify and propagate uncertainties to downstream
thermodynamic calculations. To address the issue of Bayesian prior selection,
knowledge of zero Kelvin ground states in the material system of interest is
incorporated into the prior. The effectiveness of this framework is shown by
creating a phase diagram for the FCC Zirconium Nitride system, including
confidence intervals on phase boundary regions of interest.

<h3>Phase Ordering Kinetics of the Asymmetric Coulomb Glass Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12256" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12256</a>
<br>
<i>Preeti Bhandari, Vikas Malik, Sanjay Puri</i>

We present results for phase ordering kinetics in the {\it Coulomb glass}
(CG) model, which describes electrons on a lattice with unscreened Coulombic
repulsion. The filling factor is denoted by $K \in [0,1]$. For a square lattice
with $K=0.5$ (symmetric CG), the ground state is a checkerboard with
alternating electrons and holes. In this paper, we focus on the asymmetric CG
where $K \lesssim 0.5$, i.e., the ground state is checkerboard-like with excess
holes distributed uniformly. There is no explicit quenched disorder in our
system, though the Coulombic interaction gives rise to frustration. We find
that the evolution morphology is in the same dynamical universality class as
the ordering ferromagnet. Further, the domain growth law is slightly slower
than the {\it Lifshitz-Cahn-Allen} law, $L(t) \sim t^{1/2}$, i.e., the growth
exponent is underestimated. We speculate that this could be a signature of
logarithmic growth in the asymptotic regime.

<h3>Competition between Neel, Haldane nematic, plaquette valence bond solid,  and $(π,π)$ valence bond solid phases in SU(N) analogs of $S=1$  square-lattice antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>

We use stochastic series expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to
study the phases and transitions displayed by a class of sign-free designer
Hamiltonians for SU($N$) analogs of spin $S=1$ quantum antiferromagnets on the
square lattice. The SU($N$) spins are generators of the single-row two-column
representation (complex conjugate of single-row two-column representation) on
$A$ ($B$) sublattices of the square lattice, and the Hamiltonian is designed to
explore the competition between the nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic
exchange couplings $J$ and four-spin interactions $Q$ that favor a
plaquette-ordered valence bond solid (p-VBS) ground state. We find that this
state is indeed established at large $Q/J$ for all $N > 3$. For $3< N \leq 9$,
the ground state exhibits a direct first order quantum phase transition from a
small-$Q/J$ N\'eel ordered antiferromagnetic state to this large-$Q/J$ p-VBS
state. The ground state at $Q/J=0$ for $N \geq 10$ has been previously reported
to be a valence bond nematic state, dubbed the Haldane nematic in recent
literature. For small nonzero $Q/J$ and $N \geq 10$, we additionally find an
unusual intermediate state in which the bond energy has a Bragg peak at
wavevector $(\pi,\pi)$ with no accompanying Bragg peaks at wavevectors
$(\pi,0)$ and $(0, \pi)$. This $(\pi, \pi)$ state also appears to be metastable
at $Q/J =0$, as evidenced by low temperature histograms of the Haldane nematic
and $(\pi, \pi)$ order parameters. Deep in the p-VBS phase of the ground state
phase diagram, we find the temperature-driven melting of the p-VBS order is in
the Ashkin-Teller universality class. In this regime, we identify an
interesting signature of Ashkin-Teller criticality in bond correlations at
wavevector $(\pi, \pi)$; this is in addition to the expected critical
fluctuations of the conventional p-VBS order parameter at wavevectors $(\pi,0)$
and $(0,\pi)$.

<h3>Energy-space random walk in a driven disordered Bose gas</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the experimental observation [1] that driving a non-interacting
Bose gas in a 3D box with weak disorder leads to power-law energy growth, $E
\propto t^{\eta}$ with $\eta=0.46(2)$, and compressed-exponential momentum
distributions that show dynamic scaling, we perform systematic numerical and
analytical studies of this system. Schr\"odinger-equation simulations reveal a
crossover from $\eta \approx 0.5$ to $\eta \approx 0.4$ with increasing
disorder strength, hinting at the existence of two different dynamical regimes.
We present a semi-classical model that captures the simulation results and
allows an understanding of the dynamics in terms of an energy-space random
walk, from which a crossover from $E \propto t^{1/2}$ to $E \propto t^{2/5}$
scaling is analytically obtained. The two limits correspond to the random walk
being limited by the rate of the elastic disorder-induced scattering or the
rate at which the drive can change the system's energy. Our results provide the
theoretical foundation for further experiments.

<h3>Model non-Hermitian topological operators without skin effect</h3>

We propose a general principle of constructing non-Hermitian (NH) operators
for insulating and gapless topological phases in any dimension ($d$) that over
an extended NH parameter regime feature real eigenvalues and zero-energy
topological boundary modes, when in particular their Hermitian cousins are also
topological. However, the topological zero modes disappear when the NH
operators accommodate complex eigenvalues. These systems are always devoid of
NH skin effects, thereby extending the realm of the bulk-boundary
correspondence to NH systems in terms of solely the left or right zero-energy
boundary localized eigenmodes. We showcase these general and robust outcomes
for NH topological insulators in $d=1,2$ and $3$, encompassing their
higher-order incarnations, as well as for NH topological Dirac, Weyl and
nodal-loop semimetals. Possible realizations of proposed NH topological phases
in designer materials, optical lattices and classical metamaterials are
highlighted.

<h3>Minimal Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
Minimal Kitaev chains composed of two semiconducting quantum dots coupled via
a grounded superconductor have emerged as a promising platform to realize and
study Majorana bound states (MBSs). We propose a hybrid qubit based on a
Josephson junction between two such double quantum dots (DQDs) embedded in a
superconducting qubit geometry. The qubit makes use of the $4{\pi}$-Josephson
effect in the Kitaev junction to create a subspace based on the even/odd
fermionic parities of the two DQD arrays hosting MBSs. Deep in the transmon
regime, we demonstrate that by performing circuit QED spectroscopy on such
hybrid Kitaev-Transmon "Kitmon" qubit one could observe distinct MBS features
in perfect agreement with precise analytical predictions in terms of DQD
parameters only. This agreement allows to extract the Majorana polarization in
the junction from the microwave response.
