<h3>Strongly correlated exciton-polarons in twisted homo-bilayer  heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09360" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09360</a>

<i>Giacomo Mazza, Adriano Amaricci</i>
<br>
We consider dressing of excitonic properties by strongly correlated electrons
in gate controlled twisted homo-bilayer heterostructures. The combined effect
of the moir\'e potential and the Coulomb interaction supports the formation of
different strongly correlated phases depending on the filling, including
charge-ordered metals or incompressible insulators at integer occupation. The
coupling between excitons and electrons results in a splitting of the excitonic
resonance into an attractive and a repulsive polaron peak. Analyzing the
properties of the exciton-polarons across the different phases of the system,
we reveal a discontinuous evolution of the spectrum with the formation of a
double-peak structure in the repulsive polaron branch. The double-peak
structure emerges for non-integer fillings and it is controlled by the energy
separation between the quasi-particle states close to the Fermi level and the
high-energy doublons excitations. Our results demonstrate that exciton-polarons
carry a clear hallmark of the electronic correlations and, thus, provide a
direct signature of the formation of correlation driven insulators in gate
controlled heterostructures.

<h3>Exciton optics, dynamics and transport in atomically thin semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09533</a>
<br>
<i>Raul Perea-Causin, Daniel Erkensten, Jamie M. Fitzgerald, Joshua J. P. Thompson, Roberto Rosati, Samuel Brem, Ermin Malic</i>
<br>
Atomically thin semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
monolayers exhibit a very strong Coulomb interaction, giving rise to a rich
exciton landscape. This makes these materials highly attractive for efficient
and tunable optoelectronic devices. In this article, we review the recent
progress in the understanding of exciton optics, dynamics and transport, which
crucially govern the operation of TMD-based devices. We highlight the impact of
hBN-encapsulation, which reveals a plethora of many-particle states in optical
spectra, and we outline the most novel breakthroughs in the field of
exciton-polaritonics. Moreover, we underline the direct observation of exciton
formation and thermalization in TMD monolayers and heterostructures in recent
time-resolved ARPES studies. We also show the impact of exciton density, strain
and dielectric environment on exciton diffusion and funneling. Finally, we put
forward relevant research directions in the field of atomically thin
semiconductors for the near future.

<h3>Entropy production of non-reciprocal interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09721" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09721</a>
<br>
<i>Ziluo Zhang, Rosalba Garcia-Millan</i>
<br>
Non-reciprocal interactions, in general, break detailed balance. We study an
active particle system where activity originates from asymmetric, pairwise
interaction forces that result in an injection of energy at the microscopic
scale. Using a field theory that captures microscopic dynamics, we calculate
correlation functions and the entropy production to characterise the
non-equilibrium properties of this many-particle active system in the
stationary state. We support our analytical results with numerical simulations.

<h3>Pair density wave order from electron repulsion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09254</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ming Wu, P. A. Nosov, Aavishkar A. Patel, S. Raghu</i>
<br>
A pair density wave (PDW) is a superconductor whose order parameter is a
periodic function of space, without an accompanying spatially-uniform
component. Since PDWs are not the outcome of a weak-coupling instability of a
Fermi liquid, a generic pairing mechanism for PDW order has remained elusive.
We describe and solve models having robust PDW phases. To access the
intermediate coupling limit, we invoke large $N$ limits of Fermi liquids with
repulsive BCS interactions that admit saddle point solutions. We show that the
requirements for long range PDW order are that the repulsive BCS couplings must
be non-monotonic in space and that their strength must exceed a threshold
value. We obtain a phase diagram with both finite temperature transitions to
PDW order, and a $T=0$ quantum critical point, where non-Fermi liquid behavior
occurs.

<h3>Resolving diverse oxygen transport pathways across Sr-doped lanthanum  ferrite and metal-perovskite heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09302</a>

<br>
Perovskite structured transition metal oxides are important technological
materials for catalysis and solid oxide fuel cell applications. Their
functionality often depends on oxygen diffusivity and mobility through complex
oxide heterostructures, which can be significantly impacted by structural and
chemical modifications, such as doping. Further, when utilized within
electrochemical cells, interfacial reactions with other components (e.g. Ni-
and Cr-based alloy electrodes and interconnects) can influence the perovskite's
reactivity and ion transport, leading to complex dependencies that are
difficult to control in real-world environments. Here we use isotopic tracers
and atom probe tomography to directly visualize oxygen diffusion and transport
pathways across perovskite and metal-perovskite heterostructures, i.e. (Ni-Cr
coated) Sr-doped lanthanum ferrite (LSFO). Annealing in 18O2(g) results in
elemental and isotopic redistributions through oxygen exchange (OE) in the LSFO
while Ni-Cr undergoes oxidation via multiple mechanisms and transport pathways.
Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations at experimental
conditions provide rationale for OE reaction mechanisms and reveal a complex
interplay of different thermodynamic and kinetic drivers. Our results shed
light on the fundamental coupling of defects and oxygen transport in an
important class of catalytic materials.

<h3>Eigenvalue crossing as a phase transition in relaxation dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09307" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09307</a>
<br>
<i>Gianluca Teza, Ran Yaacoby, Oren Raz</i>
<br>
When a system's parameter is abruptly changed, a relaxation towards the new
equilibrium of the system follows. We show that a crossing between the second
and third eigenvalues of the relaxation matrix results in a relaxation
trajectory singularity, which is analogous to a first-order equilibrium phase
transition. We demonstrate this in a minimal 4-state system and in the
thermodynamic limit of the 1D Ising model.

<h3>Cavity-mediated superconductor$\unicode{x2013}$ferromagnetic insulator  coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09308" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09308</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas T.G. Janssønn, Henning G. Hugdal, Arne Brataas, Sol H. Jacobsen</i>
<br>
A recent proof of concept showed that cavity photons can mediate
superconducting (SC) signatures to a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) over a
macroscopic distance [Phys. Rev. B, 102, 180506(R) (2020)]. In contrast with
conventional proximity systems, this facilitates long-distance
FI$\unicode{x2013}$SC coupling, local subjection to different drives and
temperatures, and studies of their mutual interactions without proximal
disruption of their orders. Here we derive a microscopic theory for these
interactions, with an emphasis on the leading effect on the FI, namely, an
induced anisotropy field. In an arbitrary practical example, we find an
anisotropy field of $14 \unicode{x2013} 16$ $\mu$T, which is expected to yield
an experimentally appreciable tilt of the FI spins for low-coercivity FIs such
as Bi-YIG. We discuss the implications and potential applications of such a
system in the context of superconducting spintronics.

<h3>Topological magnetic textures and long-range orders in Tb-based  quasicrystal and approximant</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09335</a>
<br>
<i>Shinji Watanabe</i>
<br>
The quasicrystal (QC) possesses a unique lattice structure with rotational
symmetry forbidden in periodic crystals. The electric property is far from
complete understanding. It has been a long-standing issue whether magnetic
long-range order is realized in the QC. Here we report our theoretical
discovery of the ferromagnetic long-range order in the Tb-based QC. The
difficulty in past theoretical studies on the QC was lack of the microscopic
theory of the crystalline electric field (CEF), which is crucially important in
the rare-earth systems. By analyzing the CEF in the Tb-based QC, we clarify
that magnetic anisotropy plays a key role in realizing unique magnetic textures
in the Tb-based QC and approximant crystal (AC). By constructing the minimal
model, we show that various magnetic textures on the icosahedron at whose
vertices Tb atoms are located. We find that the hedgehog state is characterized
by the topological charge of one and the whirling-moment state is characterized
by unusually large topological charge of three. The hedgehog and
whirling-moment states are shown to be realized as antiferromagnetic orders
transcribed as the emergent monopole and antimonopole in the 1/1 AC. We find
that these states exhibit the topological Hall effect under applied magnetic
field accompanied by the topological as well as metamagnetic transition. Our
model and the determined phase diagram are expected to be relevant to the broad
range of the rare-earth based QCs and ACs with strong magnetic anisotropy,
which are useful not only to understand magnetism but also to explore novel
topological properties.

<h3>Mechanical Properties Of Fluctuating Elastic Membranes Under Uni-Axial  Tension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09350" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09350</a>
<br>
<i>Mohamed El Hedi Bahri, Siddhartha Sarkar, Andrej Košmrlj</i>
<br>
Atomically thin sheets, such as graphene, are widely used in nanotechnology.
Recently they have also been used in applications including kirigami and
self-folding origami, where it becomes important to understand how they respond
to external loads. Motivated by this, we investigate how isotropic sheets
respond to uniaxial tension by employing the self-consistent screening analysis
method and molecular dynamics simulations. Previously, it was shown that for
freely suspended sheets thermal fluctuations effectively renormalize elastic
constants, which become scale-dependent beyond a characteristic thermal length
scale (a few nanometers for graphene at room temperature), beyond which the
bending rigidity increases, while the in-plane elastic constants reduce with
universal power law exponents. For sheets under uniaxial tension,
$\sigma_{11}$, we find that beyond a stress-dependent length scale, the
effective in-plane elastic constants become strongly anisotropic and scale
differently along the axis of uni-axial stress and orthogonal to it. The
bending rigidities on the other hand will not exhibit any anomalous behavior
beyond this stress-dependent length scale. In addition, for moderate tensions
we find a universal non-linear stress-strain relation. For large uni-axial
tensions, the Young's modulus of the bare elastic material is recovered.

<h3>Unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance in light metal/ferromagnet  bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09355</a>
<br>
<i>Shilei Ding, Paul Noël, Gunasheel Kauwtilyaa Krishnaswamy, Pietro Gambardella</i>
<br>
We report the observation of a unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) that
originates from the nonequilibrium orbital momentum induced by an electric
current in a naturally oxidized Cu/Co bilayer. The orbital-UMR scales with the
torque efficiency due to the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect upon changing the
Co thickness and temperature, reflecting their common origin. We attribute the
UMR to orbital-dependent electron scattering and orbital-to-spin conversion in
the ferromagnetic layer. In contrast to the spin-current induced UMR, the
magnon contribution to the orbital-UMR is absent in thin Co layers, which we
ascribe to the lack of coupling between low energy magnons and orbital current.
The magnon contribution to the UMR emerges in Co layers thicker than about 5
nm, which is comparable to the orbital-to-spin conversion length. Our results
provide insight into orbital-to-spin momentum transfer processes relevant for
the optimization of spintronic devices based on light metals and orbital
transport.

<h3>Ferroelectric Nematic Droplets in their Isotropic Melt</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09363</a>
<br>
<i>Kelum Perera, Rony Saha Pawan Nepal, Rohan Dharmarathna, Md Sakhawat Hossain, Md Mostafa, Alex Adaka, Ronan Waroquet, Robert J. Twieg, Antal Jakli</i>
<br>
The isotropic to ferroelectric nematic liquid transition had been
theoretically studied over one hundred years ago, but its experimental studies
are rare. Here we present polarizing optical microscopy studies and theoretical
considerations of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal droplets coexisting with
the isotropic melt. We find that the droplets have flat pancake-like shapes
that are thinner than the sample thickness as long as there is a room to
increase the lateral droplet size. In the center of the droplets a wing shaped
defect with low birefringence is present that moves perpendicular to a weak
in-plane electric field, and then extends and splits in two at higher fields.
Parallel to the defect motion and extension, the entire droplet drifts along
the electric field with speed that is independent of the size of the droplet
and is proportional to the amplitude of the electric field. After the field is
increased above 1V/mm the entire droplet gets deformed and oscillates with the
field. These observations led us to determine the polarization field and
revealed the presence of a pair of positive and negative bound electric charge
due to divergences of polarization around the defect volume.

<h3>Single Crystal Growth Tricks and Treats</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09370</a>
<br>
<i>Tanya Berry, Nicholas Ng, Tyrel M. McQueen</i>
<br>
Single crystal growth is a widely explored method of synthesizing materials
in the solid state. The last few decades have seen significant improvements in
the techniques used to synthesize single crystals, but there has been
comparatively little discussion on ways to disseminate this knowledge. We aim
to change that. Here we describe the principles of known single crystal growth
techniques as well as lesser-known variations that have assisted in the
optimization of defect control in known materials. We offer a perspective on
how to think about these synthesis methods in a grand scheme. We consider the
temperature interdependence with the reaction time as well as ways to carry out
synthesis to scale up and address some outstanding synthesis challenges. We
hope our descriptions will aid in technological advancements as well as further
developments to gain even better control over synthesis.

<h3>Dimensionless Fluctuation Balance Principle: New Statistical  Perspectives Applied to Boltzmann, Planck, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein and  Schrödinger Distributions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09384</a>
<br>
<i>Marceliano Oliveira, George Valadares, Francisco Rodrigues, Márcio Freire</i>
<br>
In this work we propose a completely new way to obtain statistics
distributions from fluctuations balance. By dimensionless fluctuation analysis
we obtain Boltzmann, Planck, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein and Schr\"odinger
Distributions using the same fundamental principle. Our result point to a
general foundation that was successful verified to principal Physics
Distributions. We name it as Dimensionless Fluctuation Balance Principle. This
is a great achievement which enable us to discuss exchange between different
physical quantities, like we do when treat energy conservation when some type
of energy is converted to another, but with more generality, because we can
exchange one physical quantity to any other. All physics model which needs
distribution can take advantage of methodology presented in this paper
including: Statistical Physics, Schr\"odinger's Quantum Mechanics,
Nanomaterials, Thin Films and New Materials Modeling. Keywords: Fluctuations,
PDEs, Boltzmann, Planck, Entropy, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, Schr\"odinger,

<h3>Helical Luttinger liquid on the edge of a 2-dimensional topological  antiferromagnet</h3>

<i>Yang Feng, Jinjiang Zhu, Weiyan Lin, Zichen Lian, Yongchao Wang, Hao Li, Hongxu Yao, Qiushi He, Yinping Pan, Yang Wu, Jinsong Zhang, Yayu Wang, Xiaodong Zhou, Jian Shen, Yihua Wang</i>
<br>
Boundary helical Luttinger liquid (HLL) with broken bulk time-reversal
symmetry belongs to a unique topological class which may occur in
antiferromagnets (AFM). Here, we search for signatures of HLL on the edge of a
recently discovered topological AFM, MnBi2Te4 even-layer. Using scanning
superconducting quantum interference device, we directly image helical edge
current in the AFM ground state appearing at its charge neutral point. Such
helical edge state accompanies an insulating bulk which is topologically
distinct from the ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase as revealed in a magnetic
field driven quantum phase transition. The edge conductance of the AFM order
follows a power-law as a function of temperature and source-drain bias which
serves as strong evidence for HLL. Such HLL scaling is robust at finite fields
below the quantum critical point. The observed HLL in a layered AFM
semiconductor represents a highly tunable topological matter compatible with
future spintronics and quantum computation.

<h3>Probabilistic Generative Transformer Language models for Generative  Design of Molecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09406" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09406</a>
<br>
<i>Lai Wei, Nihang Fu, Yuqi Song, Qian Wang, Jianjun Hu</i>
<br>
Self-supervised neural language models have recently found wide applications
in generative design of organic molecules and protein sequences as well as
representation learning for downstream structure classification and functional
prediction. However, most of the existing deep learning models for molecule
design usually require a big dataset and have a black-box architecture, which
makes it difficult to interpret their design logic. Here we propose Generative
Molecular Transformer (GMTransformer), a probabilistic neural network model for
generative design of molecules. Our model is built on the blank filling
language model originally developed for text processing, which has demonstrated
unique advantages in learning the "molecules grammars" with high-quality
generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. Benchmarked on the MOSES
datasets, our models achieve high novelty and Scaf compared to other baselines.
The probabilistic generation steps have the potential in tinkering molecule
design due to their capability of recommending how to modify existing molecules
with explanation, guided by the learned implicit molecule chemistry. The source
code and datasets can be accessed freely at

<h3>Trajectory-Resolved Weiss Fields for Quantum Spin Dynamics</h3>

<br>
We explore the dynamics of quantum spin systems in two and three dimensions
using an exact mapping to classical stochastic processes. In recent work we
explored the effectiveness of sampling around the mean field evolution as
determined by a stochastically averaged Weiss field. Here, we show that this
approach can be significantly extended by sampling around the instantaneous
Weiss field associated with each stochastic trajectory taken separately. This
trajectory-resolved approach incorporates sample to sample fluctuations and
allows for longer simulation times. We demonstrate the utility of this approach
for quenches in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional quantum Ising model.
We show that the method is particularly advantageous in situations where the
average Weiss-field vanishes, but the trajectory-resolved Weiss fields are
non-zero. We discuss the connection to the gauge-P phase space approach, where
the trajectory-resolved Weiss field can be interpreted as a gauge degree of
freedom.

<h3>Electronic Manipulation of Magnon Topology by Chirality Injection from  Boundaries</h3>

<br>
Magnon bands are known to exhibit nontrivial topology in ordered magnets
under suitable conditions, engendering topological phases referred to as
magnonic topological insulators. Conventional methods to drive a magnonic
topological phase transition are bulk magnetic or thermal operations such as
changing the direction of an external magnetic field or varying the temperature
of the system, which are undesired in device applications of magnon topology.
In this work, we lift the limitation of the magnon topology control on the bulk
non-electronic manipulation by proposing a scheme to manipulate magnonic
topological phases by electronic boundary operations of spin chirality
injection. More specifically, we consider a ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice and
show that a finite spin chirality injected from the boundary of the system via
the spin Hall effects introduces a tunable sublattice-symmetry-breaking mass
term to the bosonic counterpart of the Haldane model for the Chern insulators
and thereby allows us to electronically manipulate the bulk topology of magnons
from the boundary. The "shoulder" in the thermal Hall conductivity profile is
proposed as an experimental probe of the chirality-induced topological phase
transition. The scheme for the boundary manipulation of the magnon topology is
shown to work for a honeycomb antiferromagnet as well. We envisage that the
interfacial chirality injection may offer a nonintrusive electronic means to
tune the static and the dynamical bulk properties of general magnetic systems.

<h3>Stabilizing polar phases in binary metal oxides by hole doping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09436</a>
<br>

<br>
The recent observation of ferroelectricity in the metastable phases of binary
metal oxides (BMOs), such as HfO2, ZrO2, Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ga2O3, has garnered a
lot of attention. These metastable ferroelectric phases are typically
stabilized using epitaxial strain or alloying or through defect engineering.
Here, we propose hole doping as an alternative route to stabilize polar phases
in BMOs that have two different oxygen sublattices. Using first-principles
density-functional-theory calculations, we show that holes in these BMOs mainly
occupy one of the two oxygen sublattices. This hole localization, which is more
pronounced in the polar phase than in the nonpolar phase, lowers the
electrostatic energy of the system, and makes the polar phase more stable at
sufficiently large concentrations. We find that this behavior is also observed
for aliovalent alloying with elements that introduce holes to the system such
as La and N. Finally, we show that the spontaneous polarization in HfO2 is
robust to hole doping, and a large polarization can persist even under a high
concentration of holes.

<br>
Energy-efficient hardware implementation of machine learning algorithms for
quantum computation requires nonvolatile and electrically-programmable devices,
memristors, working at cryogenic temperatures that enable in-memory computing.
Magnetic topological insulators are promising candidates due to their tunable
magnetic order by electrical currents with high energy efficiency. Here, we
utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic
topological memristors) and introduce a chiral edge state-based cryogenic
in-memory computing scheme. On the one hand, the chiral edge state can be tuned
from left-handed to right-handed chirality through spin-momentum locked
topological surface current injection. On the other hand, the chiral edge state
exhibits giant and bipolar anomalous Hall resistance, which facilitates the
electrical readout. The memristive switching and reading of the chiral edge
state exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability, and low stochasticity. We
achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four
magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and
circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks based on magnetic
topological memristors demonstrate a software-level accuracy and lower energy
consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with
existing memristor technologies. Our results may inspire further topological
quantum physics-based novel computing schemes.

<br>
Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) sols have been synthesized from SnCl2.2H2O precursor
solution by applying two different processing conditions. The prepared sols
were then deposited on UV-Ozone treated quartz and soda lime glass (SLG)
substrates by spin coating. The as-synthesized film was soft-baked at about 100
deg. C. for 10 min. This process was repeated five times to get a compact film,
followed by air-annealing at 250 deg. C. for 2 h. The pristine and annealed
films were characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, Grazing Incident X-Ray
Diffraction (GIXRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM).
The effect of substrate surface was investigated by measuring the contact
angles with De-Ionized (DI) water. UV-Ozone treatment of substrate provides a
cleaner surface to grow a homogeneous film. The electrical resistivity of
annealed thin films was carried out by a four-point-collinear probe employing
the current reversal technique and found in the range of approx. 2x10^3 to
3x10^3 Ohm.cm. Film thickness was found in the range of approx. 137-285 nm,
measured by a stylus profilometer. UV-Vis-NIR Transmission data revealed that
all the thin film samples showed maximum (82-89) % transmission in the visible
range. The optical bandgap of the thin films was estimated to be approx. 3.75
to 4.00 eV and approx. 3.78 to 4.35 eV for the films grown on SLG and quartz
substrates, respectively.

<h3>Accurate quantification of lattice temperature dynamics from ultrafast  electron diffraction of single-crystal films using dynamical scattering  simulations</h3>

<br>
In ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) experiments, accurate retrieval of
time-resolved structural parameters such as atomic coordinates and thermal
displacement parameters requires an accurate scattering model. Unfortunately,
kinematical models are often inaccurate even for relativistic electron probes,
especially for dense, oriented single crystals where strong channeling and
multiple scattering effects are present. This article introduces and
demonstrates dynamical scattering models tailored for quantitative analysis of
UED experiments performed on single-crystal films. As a case study, we examine
ultrafast laser heating of single-crystal gold films. Comparison of kinematical
and dynamical models reveals the strong effects of dynamical scattering within
nm-scale films and their dependence on sample topography and probe kinetic
energy. Applied to UED experiments on an 11 nm thick film using 750 keV
electron probe pulses, the dynamical models provide a tenfold improvement over
a comparable kinematical model in matching the measured UED patterns. Also, the
retrieved lattice temperature rise is in very good agreement with predictions
based on previously measured optical constants of gold, whereas fitting the
Debye-Waller factor retrieves values that are more than three times lower.
Altogether, these results show the importance of dynamical scattering theory
for quantitative analysis of UED, and demonstrate models that can be
practically applied to single-crystal materials and heterostructures.

<h3>Edge and corner states in 2D non-Abelian topological insulators from an  eigenvector frame rotation perspective</h3>

<br>
<i>Tianshu Jiang, Ruo-Yang Zhang, Qinghua Guo, Biao Yang, C. T. Chan</i>
<br>
We propose the concept of 2D non-Abelian topological insulator which can
explain the energy distributions of the edge states and corner states in
systems with parity-time symmetry. From the viewpoint of non-Abelian band
topology, we establish the constraints on the 2D Zak phase and polarization. We
demonstrate that the corner states in some 2D systems can be explained as the
boundary mode of the 1D edge states arising from the multi-band non-Abelian
topology of the system. We also propose the use of off-diagonal Berry phase as
complementary information to assist the prediction of edge states in
non-Abelian topological insulators. Our work provides an alternative approach
to study edge and corner modes and this idea can be extended to 3D systems.

<h3>(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$: an antiferromagnetic triangular  Ising lattice with itinerant magnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09467</a>
<br>
<i>Xunwu Hu, Dao-Xin Yao, Kun Cao</i>
<br>
Based on first-principles calculations, an antiferromagnetic Ising model on a
triangular lattice has been proposed to interpret the order of Fe$(1)$-Ge pairs
and the formation of $\sqrt{3}$ $\times $ $\sqrt{3}$ superstructures in the
Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ (F5GT), as well as to predict the existence of similar
superstructures in Ni doped F5GT (Ni-F5GT). Our study suggests that F5GT
systems may be considered as a structural realization of the well known
antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice. Based on the
superstructures, a Heisenberg-Landau Hamiltonian, taking into account both
Heisenberg interactions and longitudinal spin fluctuations, is implemented to
describe magnetism in both F5GT and Ni-F5GT. We unveil that frustrated magnetic
interactions associated with Fe(1), tuned by a tiny Ni doping ($x \leq 0.2 $),
is responsible for the experimentally observed enhancement of the $T_c$ to 478
K in Ni-F5GT. Our calculations show that at low doping levels, monolayer
Ni-F5GT has almost the same magnetic phase diagram as that of the bulk, which
indicates a pervasive beyond room temperature ferromagnetism in this Ni doped
two-dimensional system.

<h3>Universal asymptotic correlation functions for point group  $\boldsymbol{C_{6v}}$ and an observation for triangular lattice  $\boldsymbol{Q}$-state Potts model</h3>

<br>
<i>Masafumi Fujimoto, Hiromi Otsuka</i>
<br>
We investigate universal forms for asymptotic correlation functions of
off-critical systems that possess $C_{6v}$ symmetry following the argument for
$C_{4v}$ symmetry in Phys.~Rev.~E{\bf 102},~032141. Unlike the $C_{4v}$ case, a
minimal form exists that contains only two free parameters: the normalization
constant and modulus. Using this form as a building block, we can construct
next asymptotic forms to the minimal one. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo
simulations of the triangular lattice $Q$-state Potts model above the
transition temperature and successfully obtain numerical evidence to support a
wide applicability of the minimal form to lattice models, including unsolvable
ones. From the calculated minimal form, we derive the universal shape of
equilibrium crystals in the honeycomb lattice Potts model described by an
algebraic curve of genus 1. Although the curve differs from those obtained in
the $C_{4v}$ case, the latters also have genus 1. We indicate that the
birational equivalence concept can play an important role in comparing
asymptotic forms for different point group symmetries, for example, $C_{6v}$
and $C_{4v}$.

<h3>Heavy fermion representation for twisted bilayer graphene systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Hao Shi, Xi Dai</i>
<br>
We construct a heavy fermion representation for twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) systems. Two local orbitals (per spin/valley) are analytically found,
which are exactly the maximally localized zero modes of the continuum
Hamiltonian near the AA-stacking center. They have similar properties to the
Wannier functions in [arXiv:2111.05865v2], but also have a clear interpretation
as the zeroth pseudo Landau levels (ZLL) of Dirac fermions under the uniform
strain field created by twisting [arXiv:1810.03103v3]. The electronic states of
TBG can be viewed as the hybridization between these ZLL orbitals and other
itinerant states which can be obtained following the standard procedure of
orthogonalized plane wave method. The "heavy fermion" model for TBG separates
the strongly correlated components from the itinerant components and provides a
solid base for the comprehensive understanding of the exotic physics in TBG.

<br>
Various mechanisms have been proposed for hydrogen embrittlement, but the
causation of hydrogen-induced material degradation has remained unclear. This
work shows hydrogen embrittlement due to phase instability (decomposition).
In-situ diffraction measurements revealed metastable hydrides formed in
stainless steel, typically declared as a non-hydride forming material. Hydride
formation is possible by increasing the hydrogen chemical potential during
electrochemical charging and low defect formation energy of hydrogen
interstitials. Our findings demonstrate that hydrogen-induced material
degradation can only be understood if measured in situ and in real-time during
the embrittlement process.

<br>
The long-wavelength behavior of vibrational modes plays a central role in
carrier transport, phonon-assisted optical properties, superconductivity, and
thermomechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials. Here, we present
general invariance and equilibrium conditions of the lattice potential; these
allow to recover the quadratic dispersions of flexural phonons in
low-dimensional materials, in agreement with the phenomenological model for
long-wavelength bending modes. We also prove that for any low-dimensional
material the bending modes can have a purely out-of-plane polarization in the
vacuum direction and a quadratic dispersion in the long-wavelength limit. In
addition, we propose an effective approach to treat invariance conditions in
crystals with non-vanishing Born effective charges where the long-range
dipole-dipole interactions induce a contribution to the lattice potential and
stress tensor. Our approach is successfully applied to the phonon dispersions
of 158 two-dimensional materials, highlighting its critical relevance in the
study of phonon-mediated properties of low-dimensional materials.

<h3>Thermodynamic performance of hot-carrier solar cells: A quantum  transport model</h3>

<br>
<i>Ludovico Tesser, Robert S. Whitney, Janine Splettstoesser</i>
<br>
In conventional solar cells, photogenerated carriers lose part of their
energy before they can be extracted to make electricity. The aim of hot-carrier
solar cells is to extract the carriers before this energy loss, thereby turning
more energy into electrical power. This requires extracting the carriers in a
nonequilibrium (nonthermal) energy distribution. Here, we investigate the
performance of hot-carrier solar cells for such nonequilibrium distributions.
We propose a quantum transport model in which each energy-loss process (carrier
thermalization, relaxation, and recombination) is simulated by a B\"uttiker
probe. We study charge and heat transport to analyze the hot-carrier solar
cell's power output and efficiency, introducing partial efficiencies for
different loss processes and the carrier extraction. We show that producing
electrical power from a nonequilibrium distribution has the potential to
improve the output power and efficiency. Furthermore, in the limit where the
distribution is thermal, we prove that a boxcar-shaped transmission for the
carrier extraction maximizes the efficiency at any given output power.

<h3>General nonlinear Hall current in magnetic insulators beyond the quantum  anomalous Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Kaplan, Tobias Holder, Binghai Yan</i>
<br>
Can a generic magnetic insulator exhibit a Hall current? The quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is one example of an insulating bulk carrying a
quantized Hall conductivity and other insulators (with zero Chern number)
present zero Hall conductance in the linear response regime. Here, we find that
a general magnetic insulator possesses a nonlinear Hall conductivity quadratic
to the electric field if the system breaks inversion symmetry. This
conductivity originates from an induced orbital magnetization due to virtual
interband transitions. We identify three contributions to the wavepacket
motion, a velocity shift, a positional shift, and a Berry curvature
renormalization. In contrast to the crystalline solid, we find that this
nonlinear Hall conductivity vanishes for Landau levels of a 2D electron gas,
indicating a fundamental difference between the QAHE and the Integer quantum
Hall effect.

<br>
The particle motion associated to the {\alpha}-relaxation in supercooled
liquids is still challenging scientists due to its difficulty to be probed
experimentally. By combining synchrotron techniques, we found the existence of
microscopic structure-dynamics relationships in Pt42.5Cu27Ni9.5P21 and
Pd42.5Cu27Ni9.5P21 liquids which allows us to disentangle structural and
kinetic contributions to the {\alpha}-process. While the two alloys show
similar kinetic fragilities, their structural fragilities differ and correlate
with the temperature dependence of the stretching parameter describing the
decay of the density fluctuations. This implies that the evolution of dynamical
heterogeneities in supercooled alloys is determined by the rigidity of the melt
structure. We find also that the atomic motion not only reflects the
topological order but also the chemical short-range order, which can lead to a
surprising slowdown of the {\alpha}-process at the mesoscopic length scale.
These results will contribute to the comprehension of the glass transition,
which is still missing.

<br>
The low-temperature quasi-universal behavior of amorphous solids has been
attributed to the existence of spatially-localized tunneling defects found in
the low-energy regions of the potential energy landscape. Computational models
of glasses can be studied to elucidate the microscopic nature of these defects.
Recent simulation work has demonstrated the means of generating stable glassy
configurations for models that mimic metallic glasses using the swap Monte
Carlo algorithm. Building on these studies, we present an extensive exploration
of the glassy metabasins of the potential energy landscape of a variant of the
most widely used model of metallic glasses. We carefully identify tunneling
defects and reveal their depletion with increased glass stability. The density
of tunneling defects near the experimental glass transition temperature appears
to be in good agreement with experimental measurements.

<br>
We consider high-harmonic generation (HHG) in the Rice-Mele model to study
the role of the intraband current originating from the change of the intraband
dipole via interband transition. This contribution, which has been often
neglected in previous works, is necessary for the consistent theoretical
formulation of the light-matter coupling. We demonstrate that the contribution
becomes crucial when the gap is smaller than or comparable to the excitation
frequency and the system is close to the half filling.

<h3>Tunneling processes between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states</h3>

<br>
Very recent experiments have reported the tunneling between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
(YSR) bound states at the atomic scale. These experiments have been realized
with the help of a scanning tunneling microscope where a superconducting tip is
functionalized with a magnetic impurity and is used to probe another magnetic
impurity deposited on a superconducting substrate. In this way it has become
possible to study for the first time the spin-dependent transport between
individual superconducting bound states. Motivated by these experiments, we
present here a comprehensive theoretical study of the tunneling processes
between YSR bound states in a system in which two magnetic impurities are
coupled to superconducting leads. Our theory is based on a combination of an
Anderson model with broken spin degeneracy to describe the impurities and
nonequilibrium Green's function techniques to compute the current-voltage
characteristics. This combination allows us to describe the spin-dependent
transport for an arbitrary strength of the tunnel coupling between the
impurities. We first focus on the tunnel regime and show that our theory
naturally explains the experimental observations of the appearance of current
peaks in the subgap region due to both the direct and thermal tunneling between
the YSR states in both impurities. Then, we study in detail the case of
junctions with increasing transparency, which has not been experimentally
explored yet, and predict the occurrence of a large variety of (multiple)
Andreev reflections mediated by YSR states that give rise to a very rich
structure in the subgap current. In particular, we predict the occurrence of
multiple Andreev reflections that involve YSR states in different impurities.
These processes have no analogue in single-impurity junctions and they are
manifested as current peaks with negative differential conductance for subgap
voltages.

<br>
We formulate a self-consistent model of the integer quantum Hall effect on an
infinite strip, using boundary conditions to investigate the influence of
finite-size effects on the Hall conductivity. By exploiting the translation
symmetry along the strip, we determine both the general spectral properties of
the system for a large class of boundary conditions respecting such symmetry,
and the full spectrum for (fibered) Robin boundary conditions. In particular,
we find that the latter introduce a new kind of states with no classical
analogues, and add a finer structure to the quantization pattern of the Hall
conductivity. Moreover, our model also predicts the breakdown of the quantum
Hall effect at high values of the applied electric field.

<br>
Optimal engine performances are accomplished by quantum effects. Here we
explore two routes towards ideal engines, namely (1) quantum systems that
operate as hybrid machines being able to perform more than one useful task and
(2) the suppression of fluctuations in doing such tasks. For classical devices,
the absence of fluctuations is conditioned by a high entropy production as
dictate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Here we generalize such
relations for multiterminal conductors that operate as hybrid thermal machines.
These relations are overcome in quantum conductors as we demonstrate for a
double quantum dot contacted to normal metals and a reservoir being a generator
of entangled Cooper pairs.

Ferroelectric van der Waals heterostructures provide a natural platform to
design a variety of electrically controllable devices. In this work, we
demonstrate that AB bilayer graphene encapsulated in MoTe$_2$ acts as a valley
valve that displays a switchable built-in topological gap, leading to
ferroelectrically driven topological channels. Using a combination of ab initio
calculations and low energy models, we show that the ferroelectric order of
MoTe$_2$ allows the control of the gap opening in bilayer graphene and leads to
topological channels between different ferroelectric domains. Moreover, we
analyze the effect that the moir\'e modulation between MoTe$_2$ and graphene
layers has in the topological modes, demonstrating that the edge states are
robust against moir\'e modulations of the ferroelectrically-induced electric
potential. Our results put forward ferroelectric/graphene heterostructures as
versatile platforms to engineer switchable built-in topological channels
without requiring an external electric bias.

The dynamical transition occurring in spin-glass models with one step of
Replica-Symmetry-Breaking is a mean-field artifact that disappears in finite
systems and/or in finite dimensions. The critical fluctuations that smooth the
transition are described in the $\beta$ regime by dynamical stochastic
equations. The quantitative parameters of the dynamical stochastic equations
have been computed analytically on the 3-spin Bethe lattice Spin-Glass by means
of the (static) cavity method and the equations have been solved numerically.
The resulting parameter-free dynamical predictions are shown here to be in
excellent agreement with numerical simulation data for the correlation and its

<br>
Thermal conductivity is a critical property for materials in many practical
applications, such as thermoelectric devices and heat dissipation. It has
become an issue of great concern how thermal conductivity can be effectively
manipulated. In this work, we manipulate the thermal conductivities of graphene
and graphene nanoribbon via targeted phonon quantal excitation. Ab initio
calculations show that the thermal conductivity of graphene can be tailored in
the range of 45% to 155%, compared with the intrinsic value. Molecular dynamics
simulations also exhibit a similar trend (82%-124%) for graphene nanoribbon.
This strategy provides a new way for manipulating thermal conductivity in-situ
without changing the composition of materials.

Bose-condensation in a system of 2D quasiparticles is considered in the scope
of a microscopic model. Mean-field dynamical equations are derived with the
help of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We show that the main features of
condensate interaction with the reservoir of non-condensed particles may be
captured by a simple memory term with an exponential kernel. By analysing
stationary solutions of this equation, we obtain the phase diagram of
quasiparticle gas, finding a bistability region in the parameter space of the
system. Finally, as an application of our theory, we study the phase diagram of
exciton-polariton condensate.

<i>Hikaru Okuma, Yumiko Katayama, Kazunori Ueno</i>
<br>
To elucidate the spin relaxation mechanism of SrNbO3 (SNO) ultrathin films,
the transport properties of a series of SNO films with various thicknesses were
measured on both sides of the metal insulator transition. The spin orbit
scattering time was deduced from the analysis of the magnetoresistance with
weak antilocalization theory, and it was found that the spin orbit scattering
time was inversely proportional to the momentum scattering time. This result
was explained in terms of the D`Yakonov Perel` mechanism, indicative of the
dominant Rashba effect. The values of the Rashba parameter were largest in the
values reported for other ultrathin films of metallic oxides.

<br>
The $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic bond-alternating spin chain with
the anisotropy on the ferromagnetic exchange interaction in magnetic field is
investigated using the numerical diagonalization and the density matrix
renormalization group analyses. It is found that the nematic-spin-dominant
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase is induced by the external magnetic field for
sufficiently large anisotropy. The phase diagram with respect to the anisotropy
and the magnetization is presented.

<h3>Tunable spectral narrowing enabling the functionality of graphene qubit  circuits at room temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09747" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09747</a>
<br>
<i>S. E. Shafraniuk</i>
<br>
Electrically controllable quantum coherence in quantum dot clusters and
arrays based on graphene stripes with zigzag atomic edges (ZZ-stripes) is
studied using the Dirac equation and S-matrix technique. We find that
respective multiqubit circuits promise stable operation up to room temperatures
when the coherence time is prolonged up by a few orders of magnitude through
the intrinsic spectral narrowing owing to electron transport between at bands
in adjacent sections. Respectively, the coupling of qubits to a noisy
environment is diminished, while the inelastic electron-phonon scattering is
suppressed. The Stark splitting technique enables a broad range of operations
such as all{electrical tuning of the energy level positions and width, level
splitting, controlling of the inter-qubit coupling, and the coherence time. At
the resonant energies, the phase coherence spreads over thousands of periods.
Such phenomena potentially can be utilized in quantum computing and
communication applications at room temperature.

<h3>Floquet Engineering of Nonequilibrium Valley-Polarized Quantum Anomalous  Hall Effect with Tunable Chern Number</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09753" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09753</a>
<br>
<i>Fangyang Zhan, Junjie Zeng, Zhuo Chen, Xin Jin, Jing Fan, Tingyong Chen, Rui Wang</i>
<br>
Numerous attempts have been studied so far to explore the quantum anomalous
Hall effect (QAHE), but the ultralow observed temperature strongly hinders its
practical applications. Hence, it is of great interest to go beyond the
existing paradigm of QAHE. Here, we propose that Floquet engineering offers a
strategy to realize the QAHE in nonequilibrium via hybridization of
Floquet-Bloch bands. Based on first-principles calculations and Floquet
theorem, we unveil that valley-polarized QAHE (VP-QAHE), independent of
magnetic orders, is widely present in ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic members of
two-dimensional family materials $M$Si$_2$Z$_4$ ($M$ = Mo, W, V; $Z$ = N, P,
As) by irradiating circularly polarized light (CPL). Remarkably, by tuning the
frequency, intensity, and handedness of incident CPL, the Chern number of
VP-QAHE is highly tunable and up to $\mathcal{C}=\pm 4$. We reveal that such
Chern number tunable VP-QAHE attributes to light-induced trigonal warping and
multiple band inversion at different valleys. The valley-resolved chiral edge
states and quantized plateau of Hall conductance, which facilitates the
experimental measurement, are visible inside the global band gap. Our work not
only realizes Floquet Engineering of nonequilibrium VP-QAHE with tunable Chern
number in realistic materials, but also provides a promising avenue to explore
emergent topological phases under light irradiation.

<h3>Multiscale modeling of solute diffusion in triblock copolymer membranes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09755</a>
<br>
<i>Anthony J. Cooper, Michael P. Howard, Sanket Kadulkar, David Zhao, Kris T. Delaney, Venkat Ganesan, Thomas M. Truskett, Glenn H. Fredrickson</i>
<br>
We develop a multiscale simulation model for diffusion of solutes through
porous triblock copolymer membranes. The approach combines two techniques:
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to predict the structure of the
self-assembled, solvated membrane and on-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC)
simulations to model diffusion of solutes. Solvation is simulated in SCFT by
constraining the glassy membrane matrix while relaxing the brush-like membrane
pore coating against the solvent. The kMC simulations capture the resulting
solute spatial distribution and concentration-dependent local diffusivity in
the polymer-coated pores; we parameterize the latter using particle-based
simulations. We apply our approach to simulate solute diffusion through
nonequilibrium morphologies of a model triblock copolymer, and we correlate
diffusivity with structural descriptors of the morphologies. We also compare
the model's predictions to alternative approaches based on simple lattice
random walks and find our multiscale model to be more robust and systematic to
parameterize. Our multiscale modeling approach is general and can be readily
extended in the future to other chemistries, morphologies, and models for the
local solute diffusivity and interactions with the membrane.

<h3>Single-crystalline PbTe film growth through reorientation</h3>

<br>
<i>Jason Jung, Sander G. Schellingerhout, Orson A.H. van der Molen, Wouter H.J. Peeters, Marcel A. Verheijen, Erik P.A.M. Bakkers</i>
<br>
Heteroepitaxy enables the engineering of novel properties, which do not exist
in a single material. Two principle growth modes are identified for material
combinations with large lattice mismatch, Volmer-Weber and Stranski-Krastanov.
Both lead to the formation of three-dimensional islands, hampering the growth
of flat defect-free thin films. This limits the number of viable material
combinations. Here, we report a distinct growth mode found in molecular beam
epitaxy of PbTe on InP initiated by pre-growth surface treatments. Early
nucleation forms islands analogous to the Volmer-Weber growth mode, but film
closure exhibits a flat surface with atomic terracing. Remarkably, despite
multiple distinct crystal orientations found in the initial islands, the final
film is single-crystalline. This is possible due to a reorientation process
occurring during island coalescence, facilitating high quality heteroepitaxy
despite the large lattice mismatch, difference in crystal structures and
diverging thermal expansion coefficients of PbTe and InP. This growth mode
offers a new strategy for the heteroepitaxy of dissimilar materials and expands
the realm of possible material combinations.

<h3>Brownian non-Gaussian diffusion of self-avoiding walks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09771" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09771</a>
<br>
<i>Boris Marcone, Sankaran Nampoothiri, Enzo Orlandini, Flavio Seno, Fulvio Baldovin</i>
<br>
Three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations provide a striking confirmation to
a recent theoretical prediction: the Brownian non-Gaussian diffusion of
critical self-avoiding walks. Although the mean square displacement of the
polymer center of mass grows linearly with time (Brownian behavior), the
initial probability density function is strongly non-Gaussian and crosses over
to Gaussianity only at large time. Full agreement between theory and
simulations is achieved without the employment of fitting parameters. We
discuss simulation techniques potentially capable of addressing the study of
anomalous diffusion under complex conditions like adsorption- or
Theta-transition.

<h3>Enhanced Dirac node separation in strained Cd3As2 topological semimetal</h3>

<i>Gauthier Krizman, Joaquin Bermejo-Ortiz, Manik Goyal, Alexander C. Lygo, Jiashu Wang, Zhan Zhang, Badih A. Assaf, Susanne Stemmer, Louis-Anne de Vaulchier, Yves Guldner</i>
<br>
In topological semimetals, nodes appear at symmetry points in the Brillouin
zone as a result of band inversion, and yield quasi-relativistic massless
fermions at low energies. Cd3As2 is a three-dimensional topological semimetal
that hosts two Dirac cones responsible for a variety of quantum phenomena. In
this work, we demonstrate the strain tuning of the Dirac nodes of Cd3As2
through a combination of magnetooptical infrared spectroscopy and
high-resolution X-ray diffraction studies performed on epitaxial films. In
these thin films, we observe a giant enhancement of the node separation in
momentum space by close to a factor of 4. A combination of experimental
measurements and theoretical modelling allows relate the origin of this
enhancement to a strengthening of the topological band inversion driven by
lattice strain. Our results demonstrate how strain can be used as a knob to
tune the topological properties of semimetals and to potentially enhance their
performance and response for various applications.

<h3>Reaction-limited quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09784" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09784</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriele Perfetto, Federico Carollo, Juan P. Garrahan, Igor Lesanovsky</i>
<br>
We consider the quantum nonequilibrium dynamics of systems where fermionic
particles coherently hop on a one-dimensional lattice and are subject to
dissipative processes analogous to those of classical reaction-diffusion
models. Particles can either annihilate in pairs, $A+A \to \emptyset$,
coagulate upon contact, $A+A \to A$, and possibly also branch, $A \to A+A$. In
classical settings, the interplay between these processes and particle
diffusion leads to critical dynamics as well as to absorbing state phase
transitions. Here, we analyze the impact of coherent hopping and of quantum
superposition, focusing on the so-called reaction-limited regime. Here, spatial
density fluctuations are quickly smoothed out due to fast hopping, which for
classical systems is described by a mean-field approach. By exploiting the
time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method, we demonstrate that quantum
coherence and destructive interference play a crucial role in these systems and
are responsible for the emergence of locally protected dark states and
collective behavior beyond mean-field. This can manifest both at stationarity
and during the relaxation dynamics. Our results highlight fundamental
differences between classical reaction-diffusion dynamics and their quantum
counterpart and show that quantum effects indeed change collective universal
behavior.

<h3>Tailoring negative pressure by crystal defects: Crack induced hydride  formation in Al alloys</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Tehranchi, P. Chakraborty, M. L. Freixes, E. McEniry, B. Gault, T. Hickel, J. Neugebauer</i>
<br>
Climate change motivates the search for non-carbon-emitting energy generation
and storage solutions. Metal hydrides show promising characteristics for this
purpose. They can be further stabilized by tailoring the negative pressure of
microstructural and structural defects. Using systematic ab initio and
atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that an enhancement in the formation of
hydrides at the negatively pressurized crack tip region is feasible by
increasing the mechanical tensile load on the specimen. The theoretical
predictions have been used to reassess and interpret atom probe tomography
experiments for a high-strength 7XXX-aluminium alloy that show a substantial
enhancement of hydrogen concentration at structural defects near a
stress-corrosion crack tip. These results contain important implications for
enhancing the capability of metals as H-storage materials.

<h3>Tuning the hysteresis loop for the anomalous Hall effect in Pt ultrathin  films on $\rm{CoFe_2O_4}$ by electrolyte gating</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09797" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09797</a>
<br>
<i>Leon Sakakibara, Yumiko Katayama, Tomohiro Koyama, Daichi Chiba, Kazunori Ueno</i>
<br>
Pt ultrathin films on ferromagnetic insulators have been widely studied for
spintronics applications, and magnetic moments of interface Pt atoms were
considered to be ferromagnetically ordered due to a magnetic proximity effect
(MPE). An anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is usually used to examine an
out-of-plane magnetic moments of the Pt layer. To tune ferromagnetic properties
of an Pt ultrathin film, we fabricated electric double layer transistors on Pt
thin films with thicknesses of 5.9 nm and 7.0 nm on a $\rm{CoFe_2O_4}$ (CFO)
ferrimagnetic insulator. For the Pt (7.0 nm)/CFO sample, a hysteresis loop was
observed in the anomalous Hall resistivity without the gate bias, and the
coercive field was tuned by applying the gate bias. For the Pt (5.9 nm)/CFO
sample, a hysteresis loop was not observed without a gate bias, but was opened
by applying a gate bias ($V\rm{_G} =$ $\pm$3 V). This indicated that the
long-range ferromagnetic ordering of magnetic moments in the Pt film was
switched on and off by the electric field effect. The hysteresis loop was
observed up to 19.5 K for a $V\rm{_G}$ of +3 V, while the AHE was observed up
to approximately room temperature.

<h3>Thermalization without eigenstate thermalization</h3>

<br>
<i>Aram W. Harrow, Yichen Huang</i>
<br>
In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, we
study the thermalization of a subsystem, treating the rest of the system as a
bath. In this setting, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) was
proposed to explain thermalization. Consider a nearly integrable
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body
interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model. When the
subsystem size is larger than the square root of but is still a vanishing
fraction of the system size, we prove thermalization if the system is
initialized in a random product state, while almost all eigenstates violate the
ETH. In this sense, the ETH is not a necessary condition for thermalization.

<h3>The actual pressure and temperature at the melt of elemental vanadium</h3>

<br>
<i>Joseph Gal, Lonia Friedlander</i>
<br>
It is claimed that all of the pressure scales of the reported melting curves
derived by diamond anvil cell experiments require a correction which takes into
account the pressure thermal shift, where vanadium is an illustrative example.
The linear behavior of the thermal pressure (Pth) vs. the temperature, as
predicted by first principles theoretical assumptions is then experimentally
confirmed. This allows extrapolation to determine of the actual pressure and
thermal temperature at the melt. Accounting for the role of the pressure
transmitting media in diamond anvil cell experiments, the analysis of elemental
vanadium melting curve is presented. It is shown that the appropriate
correction of shock waves melting data which takes into account the radiation
absorbed by the LiF window, applies only to vanadium metal. The correct
pressure scale of vanadium metal as derived by diamond anvil cell is presented.

<br>
We have studied the superconducting properties of the ternary
noncentrosymmetric superconductors TaXSi (X = Re, Ru), with the help of muon
spin rotation/relaxation ({\mu}SR) and density functional theory calculations.
Our transverse-field {\mu}SR measurements reveal isotropic s-wave
superconductivity in TaReSi and multi-gap superconductivity with gap nodes in
TaRuSi. Zero-field {\mu}SR measurements, highly sensitive to very small
magnetic fields find no evidence for spontaneous fields in the superconducting
state of TaReSi, whereas we observe spontaneous fields which onset with
superconductivity indicating broken time reversal symmetry (TRS)
superconductivity in TaRuSi. Broken TRS in weakly coupled TaRuSi can be
attributed to a non-unitary triplet pairing state, while in TaReSi, this state
is suppressed due to strong anti-symmetric spin orbital coupling. Our results
in TaXSi demonstrate that the strength of spin orbit coupling can be
responsible for stabilizing unconventional superconductivity.

<h3>Detecting symmetry fractionalization in gapped quantum spin liquids by  magnetic impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09853</a>
<br>
<i>Shuangyuan Lu, Yuan-Ming Lu</i>
<br>
We study the Kondo effect of spin-1/2 magnetic impurities in gapped Z2 spin
liquids on two-dimensional lattices. We find that if the impurity is placed at
a high-symmetry location, a nontrivial spinon fractionalization class of the
impurity site symmetry group will necessarily lead to a non-Kramers doublet in
the Kondo screening regime, protected by associated crystalline symmetries.
This is in sharp contrast to a featureless screening phase in the usual Kondo
effect. We demonstrate this symmetry-protected topological degeneracy by an
exactly solvable model and by the large-N theory. Based on this effect, we
discuss how thermodynamic measurements in the limit of dilute magnetic
impurities can be used to detect symmetry fractionalization in gapped Z2 spin
liquids.

<h3>Characteristics of a Nickel Vanadium redox flow battery Based on COMSOL</h3>

<br>
<i>Anupam Saha, Shinthia Binte Eskender</i>
<br>
The overpotential, dissociation rate, electrode potential distributions and
current density are suggested in this study to analyze the Nickel Vanadium
Redox Flow Battery (NVRFB). Due to its large capacity and ecofriendly
properties, NVRFB may be a viable option in the present state of energy
constraint and environmental pollution. Due to their low cost and high energy
density, nickel-based flow batteries have gained popularity. This study
demonstrates that the Ni2+/Ni+ and V5+/V4+ ions have a higher rate of
dissociation at the membrane and a lower rate at the inlet, where the
electrolyte flow velocity is greater; Because the membrane undergoes more
oxidation-reduction reactions, the electrolyte flow rate is critical in the
redox flow cell; Additionally, we see that when electrode thickness is reduced,
current density and electrode potential increase while overpotential decreases;
the model's equations are solved using the finite-element method in the COMSOL
Multiphysics program. An electrolyte-electrode interface connection is used to
simulate the reaction. The dissociation rate indicates that the
oxidation-reduction process happens at a lower membrane potential. Improving
the electrolyte flow rate enhances battery performance. Compression of the
electrodes enhances conductivity and battery performance.

<h3>Random packing fraction of binary similar particles: Onsager's model  revisited</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09873</a>
<br>
<i>H.J.H. Brouwers</i>
<br>
In this article a closed-form equation is derived for the binary random
packing fraction of similar particles with size ratios from unity to well over
2. To this end, the classic excluded volume model for spherocylinders and
cylinders by Onsager [1] is revisited and employed to derive an asymptotically
correct expression for these binary packings. From second-order perturbation it
follows that the packing fraction increase by binary polydispersity equals
2f1(1 - f1)X1(1 - X1)(u - 1)^2 +O((u - 1)^3), with f1 as monosized packing
fraction (which depends on particle shape and densification), X1 the number
fraction of a component, and u the size ratio of the two particles. This
equation has been found to be in excellent in agreement with a semi-empirical
expression provided by Mangelsdorf and Washington [2] for random close packing
of spheres, applicable to size ratios from unity to almost 2. The expression
also agrees with computer simulations of binary random close sphere packings
with size ratios up 2.5. Inserting the theoretical result based on Onsager's
model, a general equation for binary packings is proposed, applicable to size
ratios well over 2. This is expression is extensively compared with computer
simulations of binary random loose sphere packings (1 < u < 2). The derived
general closed-form equation, which contains monosized void fraction, size
ratio and composition only, again appears to be in excellent agreement with
this collection of computer-generated packing data.

<h3>Calculating interface transport parameters at finite temperatures:  Nonmagnetic interfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Kriti Gupta, Ruixi Liu, Rien J. H. Wesselink, Zhe Yuan, Paul J. Kelly</i>
<br>
First-principles scattering calculations are used to investigate spin
transport through interfaces between diffusive nonmagnetic metals where the
symmetry lowering leads to an enhancement of the effect of spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) and to a discontinuity of the spin currents passing through the
interfaces. From the conductance and local spin currents calculated for
nonmagnetic bilayers, we extract values of the room temperature interface
resistance $R_{\rm I}$, of the spin memory loss parameter $\delta$ and of the
interface spin Hall angle $\Theta_{\rm I}$ for nonmagnetic Au$|$Pt and Au$|$Pd
interfaces using a frozen thermal disorder scheme to model finite temperatures.
Substantial values of all three parameters are found with important
consequences for experiments involving nonmagnetic spacer and capping layers.
The temperature dependence of the interface parameters is determined for
Au$|$Pt.

<i>Anupam Saha1, Md. Shahjahan</i>
<br>
The purpose of this research is to generate wheat straw based super absorbent
which is eco-friendly. The chemical approach of graft-copolymerization is used
to create this novel super absorbent polymer. Polyacrylic acid is the building
block polymer that is utilized in the production of highly absorbent polymer.
Furthermore, water absorption capabilities of these environmentally friendly
absorbents are investigated in a variety of conditions and then compared to one
another. The polymer is then tested for absorbency. It is discovered that
several optimized factors, such as the time span of the immersed sample, the
effect of different solutions, and the temperature, has an impact on the
absorbencies of the super absorbent. Optical microscope pictures provided proof
of the morphological characteristics. The excellent product is achieved with
absorbencies of 251 percent in distilled water and 528.34 percent in a 4-weight
percent sodium hydroxide solution, respectively. It is also discovered that the
absorbency increased in accordance with the increase in temperature. At 80
degrees Celsius, the maximum absorbency is observed in water, at 548.6 percent.

<h3>Elastostatics of star-polygon tile-based architectured planar lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Celal Soyarslan, Andrew Gleadall, Jiongyi Yan, Hakan Argeso, Emrah Sozumert</i>
<br>
We showed a panoptic view of architectured planar lattices based on
star-polygon tilings. Four star-polygon-based lattice sub-families were
investigated numerically and experimentally. Finite element-based
homogenization allowed computation of Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus, shear
modulus, and planar bulk modulus. A comprehensive understanding of the range of
properties and micromechanical deformation mechanisms was developed. By
adjusting the star angle from $0^\circ$ to the uniqueness limit ($120^\circ$ to
$150^\circ$), our results showed an over 250-fold range in elastic modulus,
over a 10-fold range in density, and a range of $-0.919$ to $+0.988$ for
Poisson's ratio. Additively manufactured lattices showed good agreement in
properties. The additive manufacturing procedure for each lattice is available
on www.fullcontrol.xyz/#/models/1d3528. Three of the four sub-families
exhibited in-plane elastic isotropy. One showed high stiffness with auxeticity
at low density with a primarily axial deformation mode as opposed to bending
deformation for the other three lattices. The range of achievable properties,
demonstrated with property maps, proves the extension of the conventional
material-property space. Lattice metamaterials with Triangle-Triangle, Kagome,
Hexagonal, Square, Truncated Archimedean, Triangular, and Truncated Hexagonal
topologies have been studied in the literature individually. We show that all
these structures belong to the presented overarching lattices.
