<h3>Translation-invariant relativistic Langevin equation derived from first  principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18327" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18327</a>

<br>
The relativistic Langevin equation poses a number of technical and conceptual
problems related to its derivation and underlying physical assumptions.
Recently, a method has been proposed in [A. Petrosyan and A. Zaccone, J. Phys.
A: Math. Theor. 55 015001 (2022)] to derive the relativistic Langevin equation
from a first-principles particle-bath Lagrangian. As a result of the
particle-bath coupling, a new ``restoring force'' term appeared, which breaks
translation symmetry. Here we revisit this problem aiming at deriving a fully
translation-invariant relativistic Langevin equation. We successfully do this
by adopting the renormalization potential protocol originally suggested by
Caldeira and Leggett. The relativistic renormalization potential is derived
here and shown to reduce to Caldeira and Leggett's form in the non-relativistic
limit. The introduction of this renormalization potential successfully removes
the restoring force and a fully translation-invariant relativistic Langevin
equation is derived for the first time. The physically necessary character of
the renormalization potential is discussed in analogy with non-relativistic
systems, where it emerges due to the renormalization of the tagged particle
dynamics due to its interaction with the bath oscillators (a phenomenon akin to
level-repulsion or avoided-crossing in condensed matter). We discuss the
properties that the corresponding non-Markovian friction kernel has to satisfy,
with implications ranging from transport models of the quark-gluon plasma, to
relativistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations, and to electrons in graphene.

We consider the relaxation of an initial non-equilibrium state in a
one-dimensional fluid of hard rods. Since it is an interacting integrable
system, we expect it to reach the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) at long
times for generic initial conditions. Here we show that there exist initial
conditions for which the system does not reach GGE even at very long times and
in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we consider an initial condition of
uniformly distributed hard-rods in a box with the left half having particles
with a singular velocity distribution (all moving with unit velocity) and the
right half particles in thermal equilibrium. We find that the density profile
for the singular component does not spread to the full extent of the box and
keeps moving with a fixed effective speed at long times. We show that such
density profiles can be well described by the solution of the Euler equations
almost everywhere except at the location of the shocks, where we observe slight
discrepancies due to dissipation arising from the initial fluctuations of the
thermal background. To demonstrate this effect of dissipation analytically, we
consider a second initial condition with a single particle at the origin with
unit velocity in a thermal background. We find that the probability
distribution of the position of the unit velocity quasi-particle has diffusive
spreading which can be understood from the solution of the Navier-Stokes
equation of the hard rods. Finally, we consider an initial condition with a
spread in velocity distribution for which we show convergence to GGE. Our
conclusions are based on molecular dynamics simulations supported by analytical
arguments.

<h3>Ultrafast Electron Diffuse Scattering as a Tool for Studying Phonon  Transport: Phonon Hydrodynamics and Second Sound Oscillations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18793" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18793</a>

<i>Laurenz Kremeyer, Tristan L. Britt, Bradley J. Siwick, Samuel C. Huberman</i>
<br>
<br>
Hydrodynamic phonon transport phenomena, like second sound, have been
observed in liquid Helium temperatures more than 50 years ago. More recently
second sound has been observed in graphite at over 200\,K using transient
thermal grating techniques. In this work we explore the signatures of second
sound in ultrafast electron diffuse scattering (UEDS) patterns. We use density
functional theory and solve the Boltzmann transport equation to determine
time-resolved non-equilibrium phonon populations and subsequently calculate
one-phonon structure factors and diffuse scattering patterns to simulate
experimental data covering the regimes of ballistic, diffusive, and
hydrodynamic phonon transport. For systems like graphite, UEDS is capable of
extracting time-dependent phonon occupancies across the entire Brillouin zone
and ultimately lead to a more fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamic
phonon transport regime.

<h3>Microscopic theory of a Janus motor in a non-equilibrium fluid: Surface  hydrodynamics and boundary conditions</h3>

We present a derivation from first principles of the coupled equations of
motion of an active self-diffusiophoretic Janus motor and the hydrodynamic
densities of its fluid environment that are nonlinearly displaced from
equilibrium. The derivation makes use of time-dependent projection operator
techniques defined in terms of slowly varying coarse-grained microscopic
densities of the fluid species number, total momentum, and energy. The exact
equations of motion are simplified using time-scale arguments, resulting in
Markovian equations for the Janus motor linear and angular velocities with
average forces and torques that depend on the fluid densities. For a large
colloid, the fluid equations are separated into bulk and interfacial
contributions, and the conditions under which the dynamics of the fluid
densities can be accurately represented by bulk hydrodynamic equations subject
to boundary conditions on the colloid are determined. We show how the results
for boundary conditions based on continuum theory can be obtained from the
molecular description and provide Green-Kubo expressions for all transport
coefficients, including the diffusiophoretic coupling and the slip coefficient.

<h3>Rescaling invariance and anomalous energy transport in a small vertical  column of grains</h3>

It is well known that energy dissipation and finite size can deeply affect
the dynamics of granular matter, often making usual hydrodynamic approaches
problematic. Here we report on the experi-mental investigation of a small model
system, made of ten beads constrained into a 1-d geometry by a narrow vertical
pipe and shaken at the base by a piston excited by a periodic wave. Recording
the beads motion with high frame rate camera allows to investigate in detail
the microscopic dynamics and test hydrodynamic and kinetic models. Varying the
energy we explore different regimes from fully fluidized to the edge of
condensation, observing good hydrodynamic behavior down to the edge of
fluidization, despite the small system size. Density and temperature fields for
different system energies can be collapsed by suitable space and time
rescaling, and the expected constitutive equation holds very well when the
particle diameter is considered. At the same time the balance between
dissipated and fed energy is not well described by commonly adopted dependence,
due to the up-down symmetry breaking. Our observations, supported by the
measured particle velocity distributions, show a different phenomenological
temperature dependence, which yields equation solutions in agreement with
experimental results.

<h3>Comparison of grain growth mean-field models regarding predicted grain  size distributions</h3>

Mean-field models have the ability to predict grain size distribution
evolution occurring through thermomechanical solicitations. This article
focuses on a comparison of mean-field models under grain growth conditions.
Different microstructure representations are considered and discussed,
especially regarding the consideration of topology in the neighborhood
construction. Experimental data obtained with a heat treatment campaign on a
316L austenitic stainless steel are used for material parameters identification
and as a reference for model comparisons. Mean-field models are also confronted
to both mono- and bimodal initial grain size distributions to investigate the
interest of introducing neighborhood topology in microstructure predictions
models. This article exposes that improvements in the predictions are obtained
in monomodal cases for topological models. In bimodal test, no comparison with
experimental data were performed as no data were available. But relative
comparisons between models indicate few differences in predictions. The
interest of neighborhood topology in grain growth mean-field models gives
overall small improvements compared to classical mean-field models when
comparing implementation complexity.

<h3>Highly Conductive RuO2 Thin Films from Novel Facile Aqueous Chemical  Solution Deposition</h3>

Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) thin films were synthesized by Chemical Solution
Deposition (CSD) on silicon substrates using only water and acetic acid as
solvents. The microstructure, phase-purity, electrical and optical properties
as well as the thermal stability of the thin films have been characterized. The
microstructure of the thin films strongly depends on the annealing temperature:
A smooth thin film was achieved at an annealing temperature of 600{\deg}C.
Higher annealing temperatures (800{\deg}C) led to radial grain growth and an
inhomogeneous thin film. A very low resistivity of 0.89 {\Omega}m was measured
for a 220 nm-thick thin film prepared at 600{\deg}. The resistivity of the thin
films increases with temperature, which indicates metallic behavior.
Phase-purity of the thin films was confirmed with X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
measurements, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy.
Transmission and reflectivity measurements indicate that RuO2 efficiently
blocks the UV-VIS and IR wavelengths. The optical constants determined via
spectroscopic ellipsometry show high absorption in the near-IR region as well
as a lower one in the UV-VIS region. The thermal stability was investigated by
post-annealing, confirming that the thin films are stable up to 750{\deg}C in
synthetic air.

<h3>Exciton-exciton interactions in van der Waals heterobilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Exciton-exciton interactions are key to understanding non-linear optical and
transport phenomena in van der Waals heterobilayers, which emerged as versatile
platforms to study correlated electronic states. We present a combined
theory-experiment study of excitonic many-body effects based on first-principle
band structures and Coulomb interaction matrix elements. Key to our approach is
the explicit treatment of the fermionic substructure of excitons and dynamical
screening effects for density-induced energy renormalization and dissipation.
We demonstrate that dipolar blue shifts are almost perfectly compensated by
many-body effects, mainly by screening-induced self-energy corrections.
Moreover, we identify a crossover between attractive and repulsive behavior at
elevated exciton densities. Theoretical findings are supported by experimental
studies of spectrally-narrow interlayer excitons in atomically-reconstructed,
hBN-encapsulated MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. Both theory and experiment
show energy renormalization on a scale of a few meV even for high injection
densities in the vicinity of the Mott transition. Our results revise the
established picture of dipolar repulsion dominating exciton-exciton
interactions in van der Waals heterostructures and open up opportunities for
their external design.

<h3>The fundamental unit of quantum conductance and quantum diffusion for a  gas of massive particles</h3>

By analogy with the fundamental quantum units of electrical conductance
$G_0^e=\frac{2 e^2}{h}$ and thermal conductance $K_0^t=\frac{2 K_B^2 T}{h}$ we
define a fundamental quantum unit of conductance, $G_0^m$, and diffusion of a
massive gas of atomic particles, respectively given by $$ G_0^m=\frac{m^2}{h} \
, \ D_0=\frac{h}{m}$$ with $h$ the Planck constant, $K_B$ the Boltzmann
constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, $e$ the unit charge and $m$ the mass of
the atomic gas particle that move balistically in a one dimensional medium of
length $L$. The effect of scattering can be accounted for by introducing an
appropriate transmission probability in analogy with the quantum electrical
conductance model introduced by Landauer in 1957. For an electron gas
$G_0^m=1.25 \times 10^{-27} \ Kg^2/(J s)$ and $D_0 = 7.3 \times 10^{-3} \
m^2/s$, and we found a quantum expression for the generalized Einstein relation
that writes $$G_0^e = \frac{2e^2m}{h^2} D_0 $$

The Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice may provide a robust topological
quantum memory platform, but finding a material that realizes the unique spin
liquid phase remains a considerable challenge. We demonstrate that an effective
Kitaev Hamiltonian can arise from a half-filled Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian where
each site can experience a magnetic field in a different direction. As such, we
provide a method for realizing the Kitaev spin liquid on a single hexagonal
plaquette made up of twelve quantum dots. Despite the small system size, there
are clear signatures of the Kitaev spin-liquid ground state, and there is a
range of parameters where these signatures are predicted, allowing a potential
platform where Kitaev spin-liquid physics can be explored experimentally in
quantum dot plaquettes.

<h3>Isotropic 3D topological phases with broken time reversal symmetry</h3>

Axial vectors, such as current or magnetization, are commonly used order
parameters in time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. These vectors also break
isotropy in three dimensional systems, lowering the spatial symmetry. We
demonstrate that it is possible to construct a fully isotropic and
inversion-symmetric three-dimensional medium where time-reversal symmetry is
systematically broken. We devise a cubic crystal with scalar time-reversal
symmetry breaking, implemented by hopping through chiral magnetic clusters
along the crystal bonds. The presence of only the spatial symmetries of the
crystal -- finite rotation and inversion symmetry -- is sufficient to protect a
topological phase. The realization of this phase in amorphous systems with
average continuous rotation symmetry yields a statistical topological insulator
phase. We demonstrate the topological nature of our model by constructing a
bulk integer topological invariant, which guarantees gapless surface spectrum
on any surface with several overlapping Dirac nodes, analogous to crystalline
mirror Chern insulators. We also show the expected transport properties of a
three-dimensional statistical topological insulator, which remains critical on
the surface for odd values of the invariant.

<h3>High-Pressure Reentrant Ferroelectricity in PbTiO$_3$ Revisited</h3>

<i>R. E. Cohen, Muhtar Ahart, Russell J. Hemley</i>
<br>
<br>
We study ferroelectricity in the classic perovskite ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$
to very high pressures with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental
diamond anvil techniques. We use second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy
to detect lack of inversion symmetry, if present. Consistent with early
understanding and experiments, we find that ferroelectricity disappears at
moderate pressures. However, the DFT calculations show that the disappearance
arises from the overtaking of zone boundaries instabilities, and not to the
squeezing out of the off-centering ferroelectric displacements with pressure,
as previously thought. Our computations also predict a dramatic double
reentrance of ferroelectricity at higher pressures, not yet seen in
experiments.

<h3>Central role of filler-polymer interplay in nonlinear reinforcement of  elastomeric nanocomposites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18433</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre Kawak, Harshad Bhapkar, David S. Simmons</i>
<br>
<br>
Nanoparticles can greatly enhance the mechanical response of elastomeric
polymers essential to a wide range of applications, yet their precise molecular
mechanisms of high-strain reinforcement remain largely unresolved. Here we
show, based on molecular dynamics simulations, that high-strain reinforcement
emerges from an interplay between granular nanoparticulate compressive behavior
in the normal direction and polymer incompressibility. This feedback loop,
which is initiated by a mismatch in the Poisson ratios of nanofiller and
polymer, invokes a contribution from the polymer's bulk modulus to the
elongational stress, while the tendency of the polymer to contract in the
normal direction maintains a near-jammed filler state. This effect persists
even once the direct filler elongational contribution becomes dissipative after
the 'Payne effect' yield. These results indicate that direct particle-particle
contact effects, even in the absence of potential augmenting mechanisms such as
glassy polymer bridges, can drive the mechanical reinforcement effects typical
of experimental systems.

<h3>Machine learning detecting Majorana Zero Mode from Zero Bias Peak  measurements</h3>

<br>
<br>
Majorana zero modes (MZMs), emerging as exotic quasiparticles that carry
non-Abelian statistics, hold great promise for achieving fault-tolerant
topological quantum computation. A key signature of the presence of MZMs is the
zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) from tunneling differential conductance. However, the
identification of MZMs from ZBPs has faced tremendous challenges, due to the
presence of topological trivial states that generate spurious ZBP signals. In
this work, we introduce a machine-learning framework that can discern MZM from
other signals using ZBP data. Quantum transport simulation from tight-binding
models is used to generate the training data, while persistent cohomology
analysis confirms the feasibility of classification via machine learning. In
particular, even with added data noise, XGBoost classifier reaches $85\%$
accuracy for 1D tunneling conductance data and $94\%$ for 2D data incorporating
Zeeman splitting. Tests on prior ZBP experiments show that some data are more
likely to originate from MZM than others. Our model offers a quantitative
approach to assess MZMs using ZBP data. Furthermore, our results shed light on
the use of machine learning on exotic quantum systems with
experimental-computational integration.

<h3>Grain Boundary Segregation Predicted by Quantum-Accurate Segregation  Spectra but not by Classical Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18447</a>

In alloys, solute segregation at grain boundaries is classically attributed
to three driving forces: a high solution enthalpy, a high size mismatch, and a
high difference in interfacial energy. These effects are generally cast into a
single scalar segregation energy and used to predict grain boundary solute
enrichment or depletion. This approach neglects the physics of segregation at
many competing grain boundary sites, and can also miss electronic effects that
are energetically significant to the problem. In this paper, we demonstrate
that such driving forces cannot explain, nor thus predict, segregation in some
alloys. Using quantum-accurate segregation spectra that have recently become
available for some polycrystalline alloys, we predict strong segregation for
gold in aluminum, a solvent-solute combination that does not conform to
classical driving forces. Our experiments confirm these predictions and reveal
gold enrichment at grain boundaries that is two orders of magnitude over the
bulk lattice solute concentration.

<h3>Understanding the effect of curvature on the magnetization reversal of  three-dimensional nanohelices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Comprehending the interaction between geometry and magnetism in
three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures is of importance to understand the
fundamental physics of domain wall (DW) formation and pinning. Here, we use
focused electron beam-induced deposition to fabricate magnetic nanohelices with
increasing helical curvature with height. Using electron tomography and Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy, we reconstruct the 3D structure and
magnetization of the nanohelices. The surface curvature, helical curvature and
torsion of the nanohelices are then quantified from the tomographic
reconstructions. Furthermore, by using the experimental 3D reconstructions as
inputs for micromagnetic simulations we can reveal the influence of surface and
helical curvature on the magnetic reversal mechanism. Hence, we can directly
correlate the magnetic behavior of a 3D nanohelix to its experimental
structure. These results demonstrate how control of geometry in nanohelices can
be utilized in the stabilization of DWs and control of the response of the
nanostructure to applied magnetic fields.

We propose to use a recently introduced Totimorphic metamaterial for
constructing morphable space structures. As a first step to investigate the
feasibility of this concept, we present a method for morphing such structures
autonomously between different shapes using physically plausible actuations,
guaranteeing that the material traverses through valid configurations only
while morphing. With this work, we aim to lay a foundation for exploring a
promising and novel class of multi-functional, reconfigurable space structures.

Weyl fermions are hypothetical chiral particles that can also manifest as
excitations near three-dimensional band crossing points in lattice systems.
These quasiparticles are subject to the Nielsen-Ninomiya "no-go" theorem when
placed on a lattice, requiring the total chirality across the Brillouin zone to
vanish. This constraint results from the topology of the (orientable) manifold
on which they exist. Here, we ask to what extent the concepts of topology and
chirality of Weyl points remain well-defined when the underlying manifold is
non-orientable. We show that the usual notion of chirality becomes ambiguous in
this setting, allowing for systems with a non-zero total chirality.
Furthermore, we discover that Weyl points on non-orientable manifolds carry an
additional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant which satisfies a different
no-go theorem. We implement such Weyl points by imposing a non-symmorphic
symmetry in the momentum space of lattice models. Finally, we experimentally
realize all aspects of their phenomenology in a photonic platform with
synthetic momenta. Our work highlights the subtle but crucial interplay between
the topology of quasiparticles and of their underlying manifold.

With the ubiquitous acceptance of PVs, the number of devices manufactured
annually is following an exponential trend. Yet, the manufacturing process of
important brands of thin film solar cells involves a tedious and expensive step
of laser scribing. The time-consuming and technologically involved laser
scribing method remains widely used to contact the device electrodes. This work
examines an alternative method (threshold switching phenomenon) to create an
enduring conductive path in cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV, which eliminates the
pitfalls in conventional scribing technology. The samples undergoing threshold
switching show a promising sign of the conductive path compared to the control
samples. This method could potentially lead to the manufacturing technology
saving time, money, and raw materials along with added reliability and
efficiency.

We report on the modification of tin (Sn) film surfaces under a laser beam
irradiation that triggers surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitations. The
observed surface features in the form of small raised grains, with well-defined
rooting, look similar to tin whisker nodules. We attribute the appearance of
those features to the field-induced nucleation caused by the SPP related strong
electric field. Possible implications of our findings include accelerated-life
testing for tin whisker growth-related reliability as well as applications to
nanoparticle nucleation.

We study open boundary conditions for the $D^{(2)}_3$ spin chain, which
shares connections with the six-vertex model, under staggering, and also to the
antiferromagnetic Potts model. By formulating a suitable transfer matrix, we
obtain an integrable, open Hamiltonian, hence allowing for us to classify
different regions of the underlying conformal field theory from eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian.

This work presents a preliminary experimental study on the possibility to
initiate growth of whiskers on the surfaces of some technologically important
metals utilizing the enhanced electric field of surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs). The results provide evidence that a relatively high concentration of
what appear to be whisker nuclei form in the region where SPPs were excited,
whereas no such changes are observed on the untreated surface.

We report on the impact of the magnetic domain stripe configuration on the
critical velocity of vortices in superconducting/ferromagnetic bilayers. Using
a 23 nm thick Mo$_2$N film, covered by a 48 nm FePt layer with tunable
nanosized striped domains, we demonstrate that flux instability at low magnetic
fields depends on the orientation of the stripes. When the stripes are
perpendicular to the applied current and act as vortex guides, the velocity
values reach 5 km/s, duplicating those found when configured parallel to the
current, creating winding vortex paths. Our results indicate that vortex
critical velocities can be tuned by configuring different domain structures,
providing a platform to understand vortex dynamics in superconducting
microstrips.

<h3>Nonuniform Bose-Einstein condensate. I. An improvement of the  Gross-Pitaevskii method</h3>

<br>
<br>
A nonuniform condensate is usually described by the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)
equation, which is derived with the help of the c-number ansatz $\hat{
\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)=\Psi (\mathbf{r},t)$. Proceeding from a more accurate
operator ansatz $\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)=\hat{a}_{0}\Psi (\mathbf{r},t)
\sqrt{N}$, we find the equation $i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi
(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\hbar ^{2}}{2m}\frac{\partial ^{2}\Psi
(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial \mathbf{r}^{2}}+\left( 1-\frac{1}{N}\right) 2c\Psi
(\mathbf{r},t)|\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)|^{2}$ (the GP$_{N}$ equation). It differs
from the GP equation by the factor $\left( 1-\frac{1}{N}\right) $, where $N$ is
the number of Bose particles. We compare the accuracy of the GP and GP$_{N}$
equations by analyzing the ground state of a one-dimensional system of point
bosons with repulsive interaction ($c>0$) and zero boundary conditions. Both
equations are solved numerically, and the system energy $E$ and the particle
density profile $\rho (x)$ are determined for various values of~$N$, the mean
particle density $\bar{\rho}$, and the coupling constant $\gamma
=c/\bar{\rho}$. The solutions are compared with the exact ones obtained by the
Bethe ansatz. The results show that in the weak coupling limit ($N^{-2}\ll
\gamma \lesssim 0.1$), the GP and GP$_{N}$ equations describe the system
equally well if $N\gtrsim 100$. For few-boson systems ($N\lesssim 10$) with
$\gamma \lesssim N^{-2}$ the solutions of the GP$_{N}$ equation are in
excellent agreement with the exact ones. That is, the multiplier $\left(
1-\frac{1}{N}\right) $ allows one to describe few-boson systems with high
accuracy. This means that it is reasonable to extend the notion of
Bose-Einstein condensation to few-particle systems.

<h3>Prediction of Yield Surface of Single Crystal Copper from Discrete  Dislocation Dynamics and Geometric Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18539</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A yield surface of a material is a set of critical stress conditions beyond
which macroscopic plastic deformation begins. For crystalline solids, plastic
deformation occurs by the motion of dislocations, which can be captured by
discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. In this paper, we predict the
yield surfaces and strain-hardening behaviors using DDD simulations and a
geometric manifold learning approach. The yield surfaces in the
three-dimensional space of plane stress are constructed for single-crystal
copper subjected to uniaxial loading along the $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions,
respectively. With increasing plastic deformation under $[100]$ loading, the
yield surface expands nearly uniformly in all directions, corresponding to
isotropic hardening. In contrast, under $[110]$ loading, latent hardening is
observed, where the yield surface remains nearly unchanged in the orientations
in the vicinity of the loading direction itself, but expands in other
directions, resulting in an asymmetric shape. This difference in hardening
behaviors is attributed to the different dislocation multiplication behaviors
on various slip systems under the two loading conditions.

<h3>Einstein-de Haas torque as a discrete spectroscopic probe allows  nanomechanical measurement of a magnetic resonance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18546</a>
<br>
<i>K.R. Fast, J.E. Losby, G. Hajisalem, P.E. Barclay, M.R. Freeman</i>
<br>
<br>
The Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect is a fundamental, mechanical consequence of
any temporal change of magnetism in an object. EdH torque results from
conserving the object's total angular momentum: the angular momenta of all the
specimen's magnetic moments, together with its mechanical angular momentum.
Although the EdH effect is usually small and difficult to observe, it increases
in magnitude with detection frequency. We explore the frequency-dependence of
EdH torque for a thin film permalloy microstructure by employing a ladder of
flexural beam modes (with five distinct resonance frequencies spanning from 3
to 208 MHz) within a nanocavity optomechanical torque sensor via magnetic
hysteresis curves measured at mechanical resonances. At low DC fields the
gyrotropic resonance of a magnetic vortex spin texture overlaps the 208 MHz
mechanical mode. The massive EdH mechanical torques arising from this
co-resonance yield a fingerprint of vortex core pinning and depinning in the
sample. The experimental results are discussed in relation to mechanical
torques predicted from both macrospin (at high DC magnetic field) and
finite-difference solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. A
global fit of the LLG solutions to the frequency-dependent data reveals a
statistically significant discrepancy between the experimentally observed and
simulated torque phase behaviours at spin texture transitions that can be
reduced through the addition of a time constant to the conversion between
magnetic cross-product torque and mechanical torque, constrained by experiment
to be in the range of 0.5 - 4 ns.

<h3>Local atomic and magnetic structure of multiferroic (Sr,Ba)(Mn,Ti)O$_3$</h3>

<i>Braedon Jones, Christiana Z. Suggs, Elena Krivyakina, V. Ovidiu Garlea, Omar Chmaissem, Benjamin A. Frandsen</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a detailed study of the local atomic and magnetic structure of the
type-I multiferroic perovskite system (Sr,Ba)MnO$_3$ using x-ray and neutron
pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, polarized neutron scattering, and
muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques. The atomic PDF analysis reveals
widespread nanoscale tetragonal distortions of the crystal structure even in
the paraelectric phase with average cubic symmetry, corresponding to incipient
ferroelectricity in the local structure. Magnetic PDF analysis, polarized
neutron scattering, and $\mu$SR likewise confirm the presence of short-range
antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state, which grow in
magnitude as the temperature approaches the magnetic transition. We show that
these short-range magnetic correlations coincide with a reduction of the
tetragonal (i.e. ferroelectric) distortion in the average structure, suggesting
that short-range magnetism can play an important role in magnetoelectric and/or
magnetostructural phenomena even without genuine long-range magnetic order. The
reduction of the tetragonal distortion scales linearly with the local magnetic
order parameter, pointing to spontaneous linear magnetoelectric coupling in
this system. These findings provide greater insight into the multiferroic
properties of (Sr,Ba)(Mn,Ti)O$_3$ and demonstrate the importance of
investigating the local atomic and magnetic structure to gain a deeper
understanding of the intertwined degrees of freedom in multiferroics.

<h3>Quantum Interactions in Topological R166 Kagome Magnet</h3>

Kagome magnet has been found to be a fertile ground for the search of exotic
quantum states in condensed matter. Arising from the unusual geometry, the
quantum interactions in the kagome lattice give rise to various quantum states,
including the Chern-gapped Dirac fermion, Weyl fermion, flat band and van Hove
singularity. Here we review recent advances in the study of the R166 kagome
magnet (RT6E6, R = rare earths; T = transition metals; and E = Sn, Ge, etc.)
whose crystal structure highlights the transition-metal-based kagome lattice
and rare-earth sublattice. Compared with other kagome magnets, the R166 family
owns the particularly strong interplays between the d electrons on the kagome
site and the localized f electrons on the rare-earth site. In the form of
spin-orbital coupling, exchange interaction and many-body effect, the quantum
interactions play an essential role in the Berry curvature field in both the
reciprocal and real spaces of R166 family. We discuss the spectroscopic and
transport visualization of the topological electrons hosted in the Mn kagome
layer of RMn6Sn6 and the various topological effects due to the quantum
interactions, including the Chern-gap opening, the exchange-biased effect, the
topological Hall effect and the emergent inductance. We hope this work serves
as a guide for future explorations of quantum magnets.

Cyclocarbon molecules are critical in understanding the carbon structure
formation and the nature of the interaction between carbon atoms. In
cyclocarbons, light elements such as H, O and N may interplay with rings to
form doped cyclocarbon molecules. Such molecules show unique optical properties
that have never been reported before. In this study, density functional theory
with a tuned PBE functional (39% HF exchange) is employed to study the ground
and excited states of a cyclo[18] carbon molecule (C18) and its doped variants
C18M (M = H, Be, B, N, and O). The doping is shown to either make the UV-Vis
spectra of C18 blue- or red-shifted depending on the spin brought by the
dopant. Furthermore, introducing extra-atoms is found to cause the emergence of
a new set of infrared modes in the structure under investigation. Finally,
applying the molecular dynamic simulations enables one to observe the terahertz
characteristics of C18M with frequencies up to 1.5 THz due to the propagation
of a particular pattern along the carbon ring.

The two-dimensional transition metal carbide/nitride family (MXenes) has
garnered significant attention due to their highly customizable surface
functional groups. Leveraging modern material science techniques, the
customizability of MXenes can be enhanced further through the construction of
associated heterostructures. As indicated by recent research, the Mo2CTx/NiS
heterostructure has emerged as a promising candidate exhibiting superior
physical and chemical application potential. The geometrical structure of
Mo2CTx/NiS heterostructure is modeled and 6 possible configurations are
validated by Density Functional Theory simulations. The variation in functional
groups leads to structural changes in Mo2CTx/NiS interfaces, primarily
attributed to the competition between van der Waals and covalent interactions.
The presence of different functional groups results in significant band
fluctuations near the Fermi level for Ni and Mo atoms, influencing the role of
atoms and electron's ability to escape near the interface. This, in turn,
modulates the strength of covalent interactions at the MXenes/NiS interface and
alters the ease of dissociation of the MXenes/NiS complex. Notably, the
Mo2CO2/NiS(P6_3/mmc) heterostructure exhibits polymorphism, signifying that two
atomic arrangements can stabilize the structure. The transition process between
these polymorphs is also simulated, further indicating the modulation of the
electronic level of properties by a sliding operation.

<h3>Making the cut: end effects and the benefits of slicing</h3>

Cutting mechanics in soft solids have been a subject of study for several
decades, an interest fuelled by the multitude of its applications, including
material testing, manufacturing, and biomedical technology. Wire cutting is the
simplest model system to analyze the cutting resistance of a soft material.
However, even for this simple system, the complex failure mechanisms that
underpin cutting are still not completely understood. Several models that
connect the critical cutting force to the radius of the wire and the key
mechanical properties of the cut material have been proposed. An almost
ubiquitous simplifying assumption is a state of plane (and anti-plane) strain
in the material. In this paper, we show that this assumption can lead to
erroneous conclusions because even such a simple cutting problem is essentially
three-dimensional. A planar approximation restricts the analysis to the stress
distribution in the mid-plane. However, through finite element modeling, we
reveal that the maximal tensile stress - and thus the likely location of cut
initiation - is in fact located in the front plane. Friction reduces the
magnitude of this stress, but this detrimental effect can be counteracted by
large slice-to-push (shear-to-indentation) ratios. The introduction of these
end effects helps reconcile a recent controversy around the role of friction in
wire cutting, for it implies that slicing can indeed reduce required cutting
forces, but only if the slice-push ratio and the friction coefficient are
sufficiently large. Material strain-stiffening reduces the critical indentation
depth required to initiate the cut further and thus needs to be considered when
cutting non-linearly elastic materials.

<h3>Varying magnetism in the lattice distorted Y2NiIrO6 and La2NiIrO6</h3>

We investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of the newly
synthesized double perovskites Y$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$ and La$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$,
using density functional calculations, crystal field theory, superexchange
pictures, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that both systems are
antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulators, with the high-spin Ni$^{2+}$
$t_{2g}$$^{6}e_{g}$$^{2}$ ($S=1$) and the low-spin Ir$^{4+}$ $t_{2g}$$^{5}$
($S=1/2$) configurations. We address that their lattice distortion induces
$t_{2g}$-$e_{g}$ orbital mixing and thus enables the normal Ni$^{+}$-Ir$^{5+}$
charge excitation with the electron hopping from the Ir `$t_{2g}$' to Ni
`$e_g$' orbitals, which promotes the AFM Ni$^{2+}$-Ir$^{4+}$ coupling.
Therefore, the increasing $t_{2g}$-$e_{g}$ mixing accounts for the enhanced
$T_{\rm N}$ from the less distorted La$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$ to the more distorted
Y$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$. Moreover, our test calculations find that in the otherwise
ideally cubic Y$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$, the Ni$^{+}$-Ir$^{5+}$ charge excitation is
forbidden, and only the abnormal Ni$^{3+}$-Ir$^{3+}$ excitation gives a weakly
ferromagnetic (FM) behavior. Furthermore, we find that owing to the crystal
field splitting, Hund exchange, and broad band formation in the highly
coordinated fcc sublattice, Ir$^{4+}$ ions are not in the $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$
state but in the $S=1/2$ state carrying a finite orbital moment by spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). This work clarifies the varying magnetism in Y$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$
and La$_{2}$NiIrO$_{6}$ associated with the lattice distortions.

Manipulating the size and orientation of quantum materials is often used to
tune emergent phenomena, but precise control of these parameters is also
necessary from an experimental point of view. Various synthesis techniques
already exist, such as epitaxial thin film growth and chemical etching, that
are capable of producing specific sample dimensions with high precision.
However, certain materials exist as single crystals that are often difficult to
manipulate, thereby limiting their studies to a certain subset of experimental
techniques. One particular class of these materials are the lithium and sodium
iridates that are promising candidates for hosting a Kitaev quantum spin liquid
state. Here we present a controlled method of using a focused ion beam at
grazing incidence to reduce the size of a $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ single crystal
to a thickness of 1 $\mu m$. Subsequent x-ray diffraction measurements show the
lattice remains intact, albeit with a larger mosaic spread. The integrity of
the magnetic order is also preserved as the temperature dependent magnetic
diffraction peak follows the same trend as its bulk counterpart with a
transition temperature at TN = 37.5 K. Our study demonstrates a technique that
opens up the possibility of nonequilibrium experiments where submicron thin
samples are often essential.

We study the morphology of the Saturn ring defect and director structure
around a colloidal particle with normal anchoring conditions and within the
flow of the nematic host phase through a rectangular duct of comparable size to
the particle. The changes in the defect structures and director profile
influence the advection behaviour of the particle, which we compare to that in
a simple Newtonian host phase. These effects lead to a non-monotonous
dependence of the differential velocity of particle and fluid, also known as
retardation ratio, on the Ericksen number.

<br>
<br>
Inspired by the recent discovery of a successive evolutions of electronically
ordered states, we present a self-consistent theoretical analysis that treats
the interactions responsible for the chiral charge order and superconductivity
on an equal footing. It is revealed that the self-consistent theory captures
the essential features of the successive temperature evolutions of the
electronic states from the high-temperature ``triple-$Q$" $2\times 2$
charge-density-wave state to the nematic charge-density-wave phase, and finally
to the low-temperature superconducting state coexisting with the nematic charge
density wave. We provide a comprehensive explanation for the temperature
evolutions of the charge ordered states and discuss the consequences of the
intertwining of the superconductivity with the nematic charge density wave. Our
findings not only account for the successive temperature evolutions of the
ordered electronic states discovered in experiments but also provide a natural
explanation for the two-fold rotational symmetry observed in both the
charge-density-wave and superconducting states. Moreover, the intertwining of
the superconductivity with the nematic charge density wave order may also be an
advisable candidate to reconcile the divergent or seemingly contradictory
experimental outcomes regarding the superconducting properties.

Recent investigations into coalescence dynamics of complex fluid droplets
revealed the existence of sub-Newtonian behaviour for polymeric fluids (elastic
and shear thinning). We hypothesize that such delayed coalescence or
sub-Newtonian coalescence dynamics may be extended to the general class of
shear thickening fluids. To investigate this droplets of aqueous corn-starch
suspensions were chosen and its coalescence in sessile pendant configuration
was probed by high-speed real time imaging. Temporal evolution of the neck
(growth) during coalescence was quantified as a function of suspended particle
weight fraction \phi_w. The necking behaviour was found to evolve as the
power-law relation $R=at^b$ where R is neck radius with exponent $\b\le0.5$
implying it is a subset of the generic sub-Newtonian coalescence. Second
significant delay in the coalescence dynamics is observed for particle
fractions beyond the jamming fraction {\ \phi}_w>\ \phi_J\geq0.35}. Our
proposed theoretical model captures this delay implicitly through altered
suspension viscosity stemming from increased particle content.

<h3>Revisiting the work "Brownian motion with time-dependent friction and  single-particle dynamics in liquids" by Lad, Patel, and Pratap [Phys. Rev. E  105, 064107 (2022)]</h3>

<i>Vladimir Lisy, Jana Tothova</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, Lad, Patel, and Pratap (LP&P) [Phys. Rev. E 105, 064107 (2022)]
revisited a microscopic theory of molecular motion in liquids, proposed by
Glass and Rice [Phys. Rev. 176, 239 (1968)]. Coming from this theory, LP&P
derived a new equation of motion for the velocity autocorrelation function
(VAF) and argued that the friction coefficient of particles in liquids should
exponentially depend on time. The numerical solution of this equation was
fitted to the results of molecular dynamics simulations on different liquids.
In our Comment [Phys. Rev. E 108, 036107 (2023)], we showed that this solution,
obtained under the condition of zero derivative of the VAF at time t = 0, is
physically incorrect. This was evidenced by our exact analytical solution for
the VAF, not found by LP&P, and numerically, by using the same method as in the
commented work. In the Reply [Phys. Rev. E 108, 036108 (2023)], Lad, Patel,
Pratap, and Pandya claimed that our solution does not satisfy all the necessary
boundary conditions and is thus not appropriate for the description of atomic
dynamics in liquids. Until and unless proven otherwise they do not find any
reason for the reconsideration of their theory. Here we give a rebuttal to this
Reply and, returning to the original work by LP&P, show that the presented
there equation for the VAF is wrong. Due to errors in its derivation, it is,
among other inconsistencies, incompatible precisely with the boundary
conditions for the VAF which lie in the basis of their theory.

We investigate experimentally the ultrafast changes in the spectral response
of the Mott insulator $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl ($\kappa$-Cl) upon
photodoping with intense excitation at 1.6 eV and probing with continuum pulses
simultaneously covering both the terahertz and infrared (IR) ranges (from 0 to
0.6 eV). A quantitative analysis of the differential reflectivity using a
multi-band Lorentzian model provide absolute changes in spectral weights and
objective global time constants for the relaxation vs. temperature. The
transient conductivity spectra deduced from the analysis suggest that the
transient photoinduced spectral weight is dominated by a progressive closure of
the Mott gap with increasing excitation density, i.e. due to changes in the
inter-Hubbard-band absorption by the remaining singly occupied states. We
critically examine this scenario compared to that proposed previously, whereby
the low-energy spectral weight is attributed to a Drude-like response of
photoexcited doublons/holons. We also consider the observed slowing down of the
relaxation rate with increasing excitation density, and temperature dependence
of the initial doublon/holon density in terms of the phonon-mediated gap
recombination model.

Much scientific and practical interest is currently focused on the
atomic-scale mechanical behaviors of metallic nanocrystals with different
crystal structures at room temperature, while the high-temperature plastic
deformation in tungsten nanocrystals remains not well understood, due to the
technical difficulty in elevating the experimental temperature during in situ
mechanical tests in an extremely small chamber of transmission electron
microscopes. In this study, a in situ high-temperature nanomechanical testing
method is developed based on electrical-current-induced Joule heating in the
metallic nanocrystal. By this method, it is found that three distinct
deformation modes, that is deformation twinning,
body-centered-cubic-face-centered-cubic-body-centered-cubic phase
transformation and perfect dislocation slip, are sequentially activated in the
tungsten nanocrystal during high-temperature tensile test. Such ductile
behavior is related to not only the experimental temperature and but also the
loading orientation. These findings shed light on the atomic-scale plastic
deformation in body-centered cubic metals at elevated temperature.

Nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices can efficiently convert
thermal energy in the environment into random bitstreams for computational
modeling and cryptography. We recently showed that perpendicular MTJs activated
by nanosecond pulses can generate true random numbers at high data rates. Here,
we explore the dependence of probability bias - the deviations from equal
probability (50/50) 0/1 bit outcomes - of such devices on temperature, pulse
amplitude, and duration. Our experimental results and device model demonstrate
that operation with nanosecond pulses in the ballistic limit minimizes
variation of probability bias with temperature to be far lower than those
reported for other MTJ true random number generator (TRNG) device concepts.
Further, operation in the short-pulse limit reduces the bias variation with
pulse amplitude while rendering the device more sensitive to pulse duration.
These results are significant for designing TRNG MTJ circuits and establishing
operating conditions.

In this work, we used the density functional calculation (DFT) implemented in
the Quantum Espresso software, using the approximations (GGA, GGA+U) to
illustrate the electronic and magnetic properties of the perovskite CaMnO3. It
has been found that the CaMnO3 perovskite is stable in the G-AFM phase. When
expecting the total and partial DOSs, a strong contribution of the d-Mn states
has been outlined. The Coulomb correction U and the site exchange interaction J
have been implemented and then we compared the two approximations GGA and
GGA+U. It is found that the GGA+U method leads to more accurate results since
this correction takes into account the bonding effects between different atoms.
To complete this study we performed the simulations under Monte Carlo code
based on the Metropolis algorithm. In fact, we have simulated the physical
quantities: magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat of the studied
CaMnO3 material as a function of temperature.

Understanding the motion of particles with ligand-receptors is important for
biomedical applications and material design. Yet, even among a single design,
the prototypical DNA-coated colloids, seemingly similar micrometric particles
hop or roll, depending on the study. We shed light on this problem by observing
DNA-coated colloids diffusing near surfaces coated with complementary strands
for a wide array of coating designs. We find colloids rapidly switch between 2
modes: they hop - with long and fast steps - and crawl - with short and slow
steps. Both modes occur at all temperatures around the melting point and over a
wide array of designs. The particles become increasingly subdiffusive as
temperature decreases, in line with subsequent velocity steps becoming
increasingly anti-correlated. Overall, crawling (or hopping) phases are more
predominant at low (or high) temperatures; crawling is also more efficient at
low temperatures than hopping to cover large distances. We rationalize this
behavior within a simple model: at lower temperatures, the number of bound
strands increases, and detachment of all bonds is unlikely, hence, hopping is
prevented and crawling favored. We thus reveal the mechanism behind a common
design rule relying on increased strand density for long-range self-assembly:
dense strands on surfaces are required to enable crawling, possibly
facilitating particle rearrangements.

<h3>Hierarchical assembly is more robust than egalitarian assembly in  synthetic capsids</h3>

<br>
Self-assembly of complex and functional materials remains a grand challenge
in soft material science. Efficient assembly depends on a delicate balance
between thermodynamic and kinetic effects, requiring fine-tuning affinities and
concentrations of subunits. By contrast, we introduce an assembly paradigm that
allows large error-tolerance in the subunit affinity and helps avoid kinetic
traps. Our combined experimental and computational approach uses a model system
of triangular subunits programmed to assemble into T=3 icosahedral capsids
comprising 60 units. The experimental platform uses DNA origami to create
monodisperse colloids whose 3D geometry is controlled to nanometer precision,
with two distinct bonds whose affinities are controlled to kBT precision,
quantified in situ by static light scattering. The computational model uses a
coarse-grained representation of subunits, short-ranged potentials, and
Langevin dynamics. Experimental observations and modeling reveal that when the
bond affinities are unequal, two distinct hierarchical assembly pathways occur,
in which the subunits first form dimers in one case, and pentamers in another.
These hierarchical pathways produce complete capsids faster and are more robust
against affinity variation than egalitarian pathways, in which all binding
sites have equal strengths. This finding suggests that hierarchical assembly
may be a general engineering principle for optimizing self-assembly of complex
target structures.

We present a detailed electronic structure study of the non-centrosymmetric
superconductor BiPd based on our angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements and Density Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations. We
observe a high intensity distribution on the Fermi surface (FS) of this
compound resulting from various electron and hole like bands which are present
in the vicinity of the Fermi energy (Ef ). The near Ef states are primarily
composed of Bi-6p with a little admixture of Pd-4dx2-y2/zy orbitals. There are
various spin-orbit split bands involved in the crossing of Ef making a complex
FS. The FS mainly consists of multi sheets of three dimensions which disfavor
the nesting between different sheets of the FS. Our comprehensive study
elucidates that BiPd could be a s-wave multiband superconductor.

<h3>The nonlinear elastic response of bicontinuous rubber blends</h3>

Rubber blends are ubiquitous in countless technological applications. More
often than not, rubber blends exhibit complex interpenetrating microstructures,
which are thought to have a significant impact on their resulting macroscopic
mechanical properties. As a first step to understand this potential impact,
this paper presents a bottom-up or homogenization study of the nonlinear
elastic response of the prominent class of bicontinuous rubber blends, that is,
blends made of two immiscible constituents or phases segregated into an
interpenetrating network of two separate but fully continuous domains that are
perfectly bonded to one another. The focus is on blends that are isotropic and
that contain an equal volume fraction (50/50) of each phase. The
microstructures of these blends are idealized as microstructures generated by
level cuts of Gaussian random fields that are suitably constrained to be
periodic so as to allow for the construction of unit cells over which periodic
homogenization can be carried out. The homogenized or macroscopic elastic
response of such blends are determined both numerically via finite elements and
analytically via a nonlinear comparison medium method. The numerical approach
makes use of a novel meshing scheme that leads to conforming and periodic
simplicial meshes starting from a voxelized representation of the
microstructures. Results are presented for the fundamental case when both
rubber phases are Neo-Hookean, as well as when they exhibit non-Gaussian
elasticity. Remarkably, irrespective of the elastic behavior of the phases, the
results show that the homogenized response of the blends is largely insensitive
to the specific morphologies of the phases.

There is an urgent need to increase the global data storage capacity, as
current approaches lag behind the exponential growth of data generation driven
by the Internet, social media and cloud technologies. In addition to increasing
storage density, new solutions should provide long-term data archiving that
goes far beyond traditional magnetic memory, optical disks and solid-state
drives. Here, we propose a concept of energy-efficient, ultralong, high-density
data archiving based on optically active atomic-size defects in a radiation
resistance material, silicon carbide (SiC). The information is written in these
defects by focused ion beams and read using photoluminescence or
cathodoluminescence. The temperature-dependent deactivation of these defects
suggests a retention time minimum over a few generations under ambient
conditions. With near-infrared laser excitation, grayscale encoding and
multi-layer data storage, the areal density corresponds to that of Blu-ray
discs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the areal density limitation of
conventional optical data storage media due to the light diffraction can be
overcome by focused electron-beam excitation.

<br>
<br>
Engineering conduction-band valley couplings is a key challenge for Si-based
spin qubits. Recent work has shown that the most reliable method for enhancing
valley couplings entails adding Ge concentration oscillations to the quantum
well. However, ultrashort oscillation periods are difficult to grow, while long
oscillation periods do not provide useful improvements. Here, we show that the
main benefits of short-wavelength oscillations can be achieved in
long-wavelength structures through a second-order coupling process involving
Brillouin-zone folding, induced by shear strain. Moreover, we find that the
same long-wavelength period also boosts spin-orbit coupling. We finally show
that such strain can be achieved through common fabrication techniques, making
this an exceptionally promising system for scalable quantum computing.

<h3>Nature abhors a vacuum: A simple rigorous example of thermalization in  an isolated macroscopic quantum system</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We show, without relying on any unproven assumptions, that a low-density free
fermion chain exhibits thermalization in the following (restricted) sense. We
choose the initial state as a pure state drawn randomly from the Hilbert space
in which all particles are in half of the chain. This represents a
nonequilibrium state such that the half chain containing all particles is in
equilibrium at infinite temperature, and the other half chain is a vacuum. We
let the system evolve according to the unitary time evolution determined by the
Hamiltonian and, at a sufficiently large typical time, measure the particle
number in an arbitrary macroscopic region in the chain. In this setup, it is
proved that the measured number is close to the equilibrium value with
probability very close to one. Our result establishes the presence of
thermalization in a concrete model in a mathematically rigorous manner. The
most important theoretical ingredient for the proof of thermalization is the
demonstration that a nonequilibrium initial state generated as above typically
has a sufficiently large effective dimension. Here, we first give general proof
of thermalization based on two assumptions, namely, the absence of degeneracy
in energy eigenvalues and a property about the particle distribution in energy
eigenstates. We then justify these assumptions in a concrete free-fermion
model, where the absence of degeneracy is established by using number-theoretic
results. This means that our general result also applies to any lattice gas
models in which the above two assumptions are justified. To confirm the
potential wide applicability of our theory, we discuss some other models for
which the essential assumption about the particle distribution is easily
verified, and some non-random initial states whose effective dimensions are
sufficiently large.

<h3>Macroscopic emulation of microscopic magnetic particle system</h3>

In this work, it is shown that macroscopic experiments can be used to
investigate microscopic system. The macroscopic experiment allow to test the
assumptions and results obtained in theory or simulations which can not be
obtained under microscope (e.g. the orientation of the spherical particle).
To emulate dynamics of single hematite cube in water in a rotating magnetic
field, a cubic magnet is firmly positioned in the 3D printed superball shell.
The dimensionless parameter can be equalized between microscopic and
macroscopic experiment using glycerol-water mixture instead of water and by
material and infill of the 3D printed shell. The pose of the superball is
tracked using ArUco (QR code) stickers.
It was found that qualitatively macroscopic experiments coincide with
theoretical predictions. However, the reduced thermal effects in the
macroscopic experiments increase friction between the superball and the surface
which shifts the critical frequency of the system.
Since the shell is 3D printed, the given method can be extended for use of
any shape and magnetization orientation.

Prediction and discovery of new materials with desired properties are at the
forefront of quantum science and technology research. A major bottleneck in
this field is the computational resources and time complexity related to
finding new materials from ab initio calculations. In this work, an effective
and robust deep learning-based model is proposed by incorporating persistent
homology and graph neural network which offers an accuracy of 91.4% and an F1
score of 88.5% in classifying topological vs. non-topological materials,
outperforming the other state-of-the-art classifier models. The incorporation
of the graph neural network encodes the underlying relation between the atoms
into the model based on their own crystalline structures and thus proved to be
an effective method to represent and process non-euclidean data like molecules
with a relatively shallow network. The persistent homology pipeline in the
suggested neural network is capable of integrating the atom-specific
topological information into the deep learning model, increasing robustness,
and gain in performance. It is believed that the presented work will be an
efficacious tool for predicting the topological class and therefore enable the
high-throughput search for novel materials in this field.

We present our angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and density
functional theory results on quaternary topological insulator (TI)
BiSbTe1.25Se1.75 (BSTS) confirming the non-trivial topology of the surface
state bands (SSBs) in this compound. We find that the SSBs, which are are
sensitive to the atomic composition of the terminating surface have a partial
3D character. Our detailed study of the band bending (BB) effects shows that in
BSTS the Dirac point (DP) shifts by more than two times compared to that in
Bi2Se3 to reach the saturation. The stronger BB in BSTS could be due to the
difference in screening of the surface charges. From momentum density curves
(MDCs) of the ARPES data we obtained an energy dispersion relation showing the
warping strength of the Fermi surface in BSTS to be intermediate between those
found in Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 and also to be tunable by controlling the ratio of
chalcogen/pnictogen atoms. Our experiments also reveal that the nature of the
BB effects are highly sensitive to the exposure of the fresh surface to various
gas species. These findings have important implications in the tuning of DP in
TIs for technological applications.

Experimental and theoretical studies of the dynamic magnetization in swept
magnetic fields of the orthorhombic SrY$_2$O$_4$ single-crystals doped with the
Dy$^{3+}$ Kramers ions (0.01 and 0.5 at.%) with natural abundances of even and
odd Dy isotopes are presented. Impurity ions substitute for Y$^{3+}$ ions at
two nonequivalent crystallographic sites with the same local $C_s$ symmetry but
strongly different crystal fields. Well pronounced double-loop hysteresis is
observed at temperatures 2, 4, 5 and 6 K for sweeping rates of 5 and 1 mT/s.
The microscopic model of spectral, magnetic and kinetic properties of Dy$^{3+}$
ions is developed based on the results of EPR, site selective optical spectra
and magnetic relaxation measurements. The derived approach to the dynamic
magnetization in the sweeping field based on the numerical solution of
generalized master equations with time-dependent transition probabilities
induced by the electron-phonon interaction, quantum tunneling and
cross-relaxation allowed us to reproduce successfully the evolution of the
hysteresis loop shape with temperature, sweeping rate and concentration of
paramagnetic ions.

This study investigates the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the
luminescence properties of CsPbBr3 single crystals at 12 K. The luminescence at
the edge of the band gap reveals a structure attributed to free excitons,
phonon replica of the free excitons, and Rashba excitons. Changes in the
relative intensity of the free and Rashba excitons were observed with
increasing pressure, caused by changes in the probability of nonradiative
deexcitation. At pressures around 3 GPa, luminescence completely fades away.
The red shift of the energy position of the maximum luminescence of free and
Rashba excitons in pressure ranges of 0-1.3 GPa is attributed to the length
reduction of Pb-Br bonds in [PbBr6]4- octahedra, while the high-energy shift of
the Rashba excitons at pressures above 1.3 GPa is due to [PbBr6]4- octahedra
rotation and changes in the Pb-Br_Pb angle.

In this work, we present an analytical framework for studying
antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating states in the Hubbard model. We first
derive an analytical solution for the single-particle Green's functions in the
atomic limit. Within a second-order perturbation approach, we compute the
ground state energy and show that the ground state is antiferromagnetically
ordered. Then we derive an analytical solution for single-particle Green's
functions when effects of the hopping term are considered in the N\'{e}el
state. With the analytical solution, we compute and explain various properties
of antiferromagnetic Mott insulators observed both experimentally and
numerically: i) magnetic blueshift of the Mott gap; ii) spectral functions with
features comparable to observations by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy on parental compounds of cuprate high $T_c$ superconductors. This
work comprehends the electronic properties of antiferromagnetic Mott states
analytically and provides a foundation for future investigations of doped
antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, aiming for the mechanism of cuprates
high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

Correlation effects are observed strong in Iron chalcogenides superconductors
by experimental and theoretical investigations. We present a comparative study
of the influence of Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling in the electronic
structure of FeSe and FeTe. The calculation is based on density functional
theory (DFT) with local density approximation(LDA+U) framework employed in
TB-LMTO ASA code. We found the correlation effects were orbital selective due
to the strength of interorbital hybridization among different Fe-3d orbitals
mediated via chalcogen (Se/Te-p) orbitals is different in both the compounds,
however Coulomb interaction is screened significantly by Te-p bands in FeTe.
Similarly the orbital section is different in both the compounds because of the
difference in the chalcogen height.

The compressed hydrogen-rich compounds have received extensive attention as
promising candidates for room temperature superconductivity, however, the high
pressure required to stabilize such materials hinders their wide practical
application. In order to search for potential superconducting hydrides that are
stable at low pressures, we have investigated the crystal structures and
properties of quaternary hydrides, XM3Be4H32 (X, M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, La, Ac, Th)
based on the first-principles calculations. We identified eight dynamically
stable compounds at moderate pressure of 20 GPa. Strikingly, their
superconducting transition temperatures are much higher than that of liquid
nitrogen, especially CaTh3Be4H32 (124 K at 5 GPa), ThLa3Be4H32(134 K at 10 GPa)
and LaAc3Be4H32 (135 K at 20 GPa) exhibit outstanding superconductivity at mild
pressures. Metal atoms acting as pre-compressors donate abundant electrons to
hydrogen, weakening the H-H covalent bond and thus facilitating the
metallization of the hydrogen sublattice. At the same time, the appropriate
combination of metal elements with different ionic radius and electronegativity
can effectively tune the electronic structure near the Fermi level and improve
the superconductivity. These findings fully reveal the great promise of hosting
high-temperature superconductivity of quaternary hydrides at moderate pressures
and will further promote related exploration.

<br>
<br>
Specific heat can explore low-energy quasiparticle excitations of
superconductors, so it is a powerful tool for bulk measurement on the
superconducting gap structure and pairing symmetry. Here, we report an in-depth
investigation on the specific heat of the multiband superconductors
KCa$_2$(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ ($x$ = 0, 0.05, 0.13) single crystals
and the overdoped non-superconducting one with $x$ = 0.17. For the samples with
$x$ = 0 and $x$ = 0.05, the magnetic field induced specific heat coefficient
$\Delta\gamma(H)$ in the low temperature limit increases rapidly below 2 T,
then it rises slowly above 2 T. Using the non-superconducting sample with $x$ =
0.17 as a reference, and applying a mixed model that combines Debye and
Einstein modes, the specific heat of phonon background for various
superconducting samples can be fitted and the detailed information of the
electronic specific heat is obtained. Through comparative analyses, it is found
that the energy gap structure including two $s$-wave gaps and an extended
$s$-wave gap with large anisotropy can reasonably describe the electronic
specific heat data. According to these results, we suggest that at least one
anisotropic superconducting gap with a deep gap minimum should exist in this
multiband system. With the doping of Ni, the $T_c$ of the sample decreases
along with the decrease of the large $s$-wave gap, but the extended $s$-wave
gap increases due to the enlarged electron pockets via adding more electrons.
Despite these changes, the general properties of the gap structure remain
unchanged versus doping Ni. In addition, the calculation of condensation energy
of the parent and doped samples shows the rough consistency with the
correlation of $U_0 \propto {T_c}^n$ with $n$ = 3-4, which is beyond the
understanding of the BCS theory.

<h3>Quasi-static remanence as a generic-feature of spin-canting in  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction driven canted-antiferromagnets</h3>

We consistently observe a unique pattern in remanence in a number of
canted-antiferromagnets (AFM) and piezomagnets. A part of the remanence is
$\textit{quasi-static}$ in nature and vanishes above a critical magnetic field.
Present work is devoted to exploring this $\textit{quasi-static}$ remanence
($\mu$) in a series of isostructural canted-AFMs and piezomagnets that possess
progressively increasing N\'eel temperature ($T{_N}$). Comprehensive
investigation of remanence as a function of $\textit{magnetic-field}$ and
$\textit{time}$ in CoCO$_{3}$, NiCO$_{3}$ and MnCO$_{3}$ reveals that the
magnitude of $\mu$ increases with decreasing $T{_N}$, but the stability with
time is higher in the samples with higher $T{_N}$. Further to this, all three
carbonates exhibit a universal scaling in $\mu$, which relates to the
concurrent phenomenon of piezomagnetism. Overall, these data not only establish
that the observation of $\textit{quasi-static}$ remanence with
$\textit{counter-intuitive}$ magnetic-field dependence can serve as a
foot-print for spin-canted systems, but also confirms that simple remanence
measurements, using SQUID magnetometry, can provide insights about the extent
of spin canting - a non trivial parameter to determine. In addition, these data
suggest that the functional form of $\mu$ with $\textit{magnetic-field}$ and
$\textit{time}$ may hold key to isolate Dzyaloshinskii Moriya Interaction
driven spin-canted systems from Single Ion Anisotropy driven ones. We also
demonstrate the existence of $\mu$ by tracking specific peaks in neutron
diffraction data, acquired in remnant state in CoCO$_{3}$.

We theoretically investigate a novel two-dimensional decorated honeycomb
lattice framework to realize a second-order topological magnon insulator
(SOTMI) phase featuring distinct corner-localized modes. Our study emphasizes
the pivotal role of spin-magnon mapping in characterizing bosonic topological
properties, which exhibit differences from their fermionic counterparts. We
employ a symmetry indicator topological invariant to identify and characterize
this SOTMI phase, particularly for systems respecting time-reversal and
${\sf{C}}_6$ rotational symmetry. Using a spin model defined on a honeycomb
lattice geometry, we demonstrate that introducing "kekule" type distortions
yields a topological phase. In contrast, anti-kekule" distortions result in a
non-topological magnonic phase. The presence of kekule distortions manifests in
two distinct topologically protected bosonic corner modes - an "intrinsic" and
a "pseudo", based on the specific edge terminations. On the other hand,
anti-kekule distortions give rise to bond-localized boundary modes, which are
non-topological and reliant on particular edge termination. We further
investigate the effects of random out-of-plane exchange anisotropy disorder on
the robustness of these bosonic corner modes. The distinction between SOTMIs
and their fermionic counterparts arises due to the system-specific magnonic
onsite energies, a crucial feature often overlooked in prior literature. Our
study unveils exciting prospects for engineering higher-order topological
phases in magnon systems and enhances our understanding of their unique
behavior within decorated honeycomb lattices.

We present a comparative study of the valence band electronic structure of Pd
based ternary chalcogenide superconductors Nb2Pd0.95S5, Ta2Pd0.97S6 and
Ta2Pd0.97Te6 using experimental photoemission spectroscopy and density
functional based theoretical calculations. We observe a qualitatively
similarity between valence band (VB) spectra of Nb2Pd0.95S5 and Ta2Pd0.97S6.
Further, we find a pseudogap feature in Nb2Pd0.95S5 at low temperature, unlike
other two compounds. We have correlated the structural geometry with the
differences in VB spectra of these compounds. The different atomic packing in
these compounds could vary the strength of inter-orbital hybridization among
various atoms which leads to difference in their electronic structure as
clearly observed in our DOS calculations.

We report on the field-effect modulation of the charge-density-wave quantum
condensate in the top-gated heterostructure devices implemented with
quasi-one-dimensional NbS3 nanowire channels and quasi-two-dimensional h-BN
gate dielectric layers. The charge-density-wave phases and collective current
in quasi-1D NbS3 nanowires were verified via temperature dependence of the
resistivity, non-linear current-voltage characteristics, and Shapiro steps that
appeared in the device response under radio frequency excitation mixed with the
DC bias. It was demonstrated that the electric field of the applied gate bias
can reversibly modulate the collective current of the sliding
charge-density-wave condensate. The collective current reduces with more
positive bias suggesting a surface effect on the condensate mobility. The
single particle current, at small source-drain biases, shows small amplitude
fluctuation behavior, attributed to the variations in the background potential
due to the pinned or creeping charge-density-wave condensate. The knowledge of
the electric-field effect on the charge density waves in quasi-1D NbS3
nanowires is useful for potential electronic applications of such quantum
materials.

The Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo method with
directed loops is very efficient for spin and boson systems. The Heisenberg
model and its generalizations, such as $JQ_2$ models, are extensively simulated
via this method. When introducing magnetic field in these models, the SSE
method always combines the field with the diagonal part of Heisenberg
interactions (${S_i}^z{S_j}^z$) and take them as the new diagonal operators. In
general, this treatment is reasonable. However, when studying Hamiltonians
which have other interactions or even don't contain the Heisenberg
interactions, this general treatment will not be efficient or even doesn't
work. We suggest that when doing directed-loop simulations, the magnetic field
can be put into other interactions. This new treatment may improve the
simulation efficiency. Using the $JQ_2$ model with magnetic field as an
example, we here demonstrate this new SSE method with directed loops. Such new
treatment will improve the efficiency especially when $Q_2$ interactions are
strong. In addition, we argue that we can divide the magnetic field into two
parts and combine them with both $J$ and $Q$ operators respectively. The SSE
method with this treatment can be more efficient. The underlying mechanism is
that these two new SSE methods can utilize the main part or even all part of
operators in operator products to do the directed-loop updates. Such idea can
also be applied to other models with magnetic field and it will speed up the
simulations.

In the past decade, there has been a systematic investigation of
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting fermion systems.
Specifically, by utilizing the concept of equivalence classes of finite-depth
fermionic symmetric local unitary (FSLU) transformations and the decorating
symmetry domain wall picture, a large class of fixed-point wave functions have
been constructed for fermionic SPT (FSPT) phases. Remarkably, this construction
coincides with the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, enabling a complete
classification of FSPT phases. However, unlike bosonic SPT phases, the stacking
group structure in fermion systems proves to be much more intricate. The
construction of fixed-point wave functions does not explicitly provide this
information. In this paper, we employ FSLU transformations to investigate the
stacking group structure of FSPT phases. Specifically, we demonstrate how to
compute stacking FSPT data from the input FSPT data in each layer, considering
both unitary and anti-unitary symmetry, up to 2+1 dimensions. As concrete
examples, we explictly compute the stacking group structure for crystalline
FSPT phases in all 17 wallpaper groups using the fermionic crystalline
equivalence principle. Importantly, our approach can be readily extended to
higher dimensions, offering a versatile method for exploring the stacking group
structure of FSPT phases.

We present a comparative study of our valence band photoemission results on
Nb2Pd1.2Se5 and Nb2Pd0.95S5 superconductors which is supported by our DFT based
electronic structure calculations. We observe that the VB spectra of both the
compounds are qualitatively similar, except slight difference in the binding
energy position of all features between the two compounds which could be the
result of different electronegativity of Se and S atom. The calculated density
of states reveal that the VB features are mainly composed of Pd Se S hybridized
states. The nature of DOS originating from the distinctly coordinated Pd atoms
is different. Further, the involvement of the various Pd 4d and Nb 4d states in
crossing of Fermi level signifies the multiband character of these compounds.
In addition, we find a temperature dependent pseudogap in Nb2Pd0.95S5 which is
absent in Nb2Pd1.2Se5.

Nonlinear transport phenomena offer an exciting probe into the topology and
band geometry of the system. Here, we investigate the intrinsic third-order
nonlinear responses, independent of the scattering time, using the density
matrix-based quantum kinetic formalism. We predict a new intrinsic third-order
response that is dissipative and identify a novel intrinsic contribution to the
dissipationless Hall response. We demonstrate that these previously unexplored
contributions originate from the band geometric quantities such as the Berry
curvature and symplectic connection, which are finite in systems that break
time-reversal symmetry. We prescribe the symmetry dictionary for these
fundamental transport coefficients and unify our quantum kinetic results with
results from semiclassical wave-packet formalism. We illustrate our results in
antiferromagnetic monolayer SrMnBi$_2$. Our study significantly advances the
fundamental understanding of third-order responses.

Using mode coupling theory the conditions for all allowed dynamical
universality classes for the conserved modes in one-dimensional driven systems
are presented in closed form as a function of the stationary currents and their
derivatives. With a view on the search for the golden ratio universality class
the existence of some families of microscopic models is ruled out a priori by
using an Onsager-type macroscopic current symmetry. At equal mean densities of
the conserved quantities the golden modes can only appear if the currents are
antisymmetric under interchange of the conserved densities and if these
densities are correlated, but not in the symmetric case where at equal
densities one mode is always diffusive and the second may be either
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ), modified KPZ, 3/2-L\'evy, or also diffusive. We also
show that the predictions of mode coupling theory for a noisy chain of harmonic
oscillators are exact.

Design and analysis of inelastic materials requires prediction of physical
responses that evolve under loading. Numerical simulation of such behavior
using finite element (FE) approaches can call for significant time and
computational effort. To address this challenge, this paper demonstrates a deep
learning (DL) framework that is capable of predicting micro-scale
elasto-plastic strains and stresses in a two-phase medium, at a much greater
speed than traditional FE simulations. The proposed framework uses a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture with 3D
operations, to map the composite microstructure to the corresponding stress and
strain fields under a predetermined load path. In particular, the model is
applied to a two-phase fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite microstructure
subjected to a given loading-unloading path, predicting the corresponding
stress and strain fields at discrete intermediate load steps. A novel two-step
training approach provides more accurate predictions of stress, by first
training the model to predict strain fields and then using those strain fields
as input to the model that predicts the stress fields. This efficient
data-driven approach enables accurate prediction of physical fields in
inelastic materials, based solely on microstructure images and loading
information.

<h3>Observation of Dirac-like surface state bands on the top surface of BiSe</h3>

Two quintuple layers of strong topological insulator Bi2Se3 are coupled by a
Bi bilayer in BiSe crystal. We investigated its electronic structure using
angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to study its topological nature.
Dirac like linearly dispersive surface state bands are observed on the 001
surface of BiSe and Sb doped BiSe, similar to Bi2Se3. Moreover, the lower part
of the SSBs buries deep in the bulk valence band. Overlap region between the
SSBs and BVB is large in Sb doped system and the SSBs deviate from the Dirac
like linear dispersion in this region.
These results highlight the role of interlayer coupling between the Bi
bilayer and the Bi2Se3 QLs.
Furthermore, we observed a large intensity imbalance in the SSBs located at
the positive and negative k parallel directions. This asymmetry pattern
gradually reverses as the excitation energy scans from low 14eV to high 34eV
value. However, we did not observe signal of surface magnetization resulting
from the intensity imbalance in SSBs due to hole-generated uncompensated spin
accumulation in the photoexcitation process. The main reason for this could be
the faster relaxation process for photo hole due to the presence of the Bi
bilayer between the adjacent Bi2Se3 QLs. The observed photon energy dependent
intensity variation could be a signature of the mixing between the spin and the
orbit texture of the SSBs.

Narrow bandgap and its tuning are important aspects of materials for their
technological applications. In this context group IV VI semiconductors are one
of the interesting candidates. In this paper, we explore the possibility of
bandgap tuning in one of the family member of this family GeSe by using
isoelectronic Pb doping. Our study is first principles based electronic
structure calculations of GePbSe. This study reveals that the Ge-p and Se-p
states are strongly hybridized in GeSe and shows a gap in the DOS at Ef in
GeSe. This gap reduces systematically with simultaneous enhancement of the
states in the near Ef region as a function of Pb doping. This leads tuning of
the indirect bandgap in GeSe via Pb doping. The results of the indirect bandgap
decrement are consistent with the experimental findings. We propose a mechanism
where the electrostatic effect of dopant Pb cation could be responsible for
these changes in the electronic structure of GeSe.

Topological semimetal antiferromagnets provide a rich source of exotic
topological states which can be controlled by manipulating the orientation of
the N\'eel vector, or by modulating the lattice parameters through strain. We
investigate via ${ab\ initio}$ density functional theory calculations, the
effects of shear strain on the bulk and surface states n two antiferromagnetic
EuCd$_2$As$_2$ phases with out-of-plane and in-plane spin configurations. When
magnetic moments are along the $\textit{c}$-axis, a $3\%$ longitudinal or
diagonal shear strain can tune the Dirac semimetal phase to an axion insulator
phase, characterized by the parity-based invariant $\eta_{4I} = 2$. For an
in-plane magnetic order, the axion insulator phase remains robust under all
shear strains. We further find that for both magnetic orders, the bulk gap
increases and a surface gap opens on the (001) surface up to 16 meV. Because of
a nonzero $\eta_{4I}$ index and gapped states on the (001) surface, hinge modes
are expected to happen on the side surface states between those gapped surface
states. This result can provide a valuable insight in the realization of the
long-sought axion states.

<h3>Trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides within the  hyperspherical harmonics method</h3>

We develop the theoretical formalism and study the formation of valley trions
in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers within the framework of a
non-relativistic potential model using the method of hyperspherical harmonics
(HH) in four-dimensional space. We present the solution of the three-body
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Rytova-Keldysh (RK) potential by expanding
the wave function of a trion in terms of the HH. The antisymmetrization of
trions wave function is based on the electron and hole spin and valley indices.
We consider a long-range approximation when the RK potential is approximated
by the Coulomb potential and a short-range limit when this potential is
approximated by the logarithmic potential. In a diagonal approximation, the
coupled system of differential equations for the hyperradial functions is
decoupled in both limits. Our approach yields the analytical solution for
binding energy and wave function of trions in the diagonal approximation for
these two limiting cases - the Coulomb and logarithmic potentials. We obtain
exact analytical expressions for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for negatively
and positively charged trions. The corresponding energy eigenvalues can be
considered as the lower and upper limits for the trions binding energies.
The proposed theoretical approach can describe trions in TMDCs and address
the energy difference between the binding energies of $X^{-}$ and $X^{+}$ in
TMDC. Results of numerical calculations for the ground state energies with the
RK potential are in good agreement with similar calculations and in reasonable
agreement with experimental measurements of trion binding energies.

Inducing and controlling electrostatic barriers in two-dimensional (2D)
quantum materials has shown extraordinary promise to enable control of charge
carriers, and is key for the realization of nanoscale electronic and
optoelectronic devices1-10. Because of their atomically thin nature, the 2D
materials have a congenital advantage to construct the thinnest possible p-n
junctions1,3,7,9,10. To realize the ultimate functional unit for future
nanoscale devices, creating atomically wide electrostatic barriers embedded in
2D materials is desired and remains an extremely challenge. Here we report the
creation and manipulation of atomically wide electrostatic barriers embedded in
graphene WSe2 heterostructures. By using a STM tip, we demonstrate the ability
to generate a one-dimensional (1D) atomically wide boundary between 1T-WSe2
domains and continuously tune positions of the boundary because of
ferroelasticity of the 1T-WSe2. Our experiment indicates that the 1D boundary
introduces atomically wide electrostatic barriers in graphene above it. Then
the 1D electrostatic barrier changes a single graphene WSe2 heterostructure
quantum dot from a relativistic artificial atom to a relativistic artificial
molecule.

We use magnetoresistance measurements at high magnetic field (B \leq 65 T)
and low temperature (T \geq 500 mK) to gain fresh insights into the behavior of
the upper critical field, Hc2, in superconducting ultrathin FeSe films of
varying degrees of disorder, grown by molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3.
Measurements of Hc2 across samples with a widely varying superconducting
critical temperature (1.2 K \leq Tc \leq 21 K) generically show similar
qualitative temperature dependence. We analyze the temperature dependence of
Hc2 in the context of Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory. The analysis
yields parameters that indicate a strong Pauli paramagnetic pair-breaking
mechanism which is also reflected by pseudo-isotropic superconductivity in the
limit of zero temperature. In the lower Tc samples, we observe a spin-orbit
scattering driven enhancement of Hc2 above the strongly-coupled Pauli
paramagnetic limit. We also observe clear deviations from WHH theory at low
temperature, regardless of Tc. We attribute this to the multi-band
superconductivity of FeSe and possibly to the emergence of a low temperature,
high field superconducting phase.

<h3>Anomalous boundary correspondence of topological phases</h3>

Topological phases protected by crystalline symmetries and internal
symmetries are shown to enjoy fascinating one-to-one correspondence in
classification. Here we investigate the physics content behind the abstract
correspondence in three or higher-dimensional systems. We show correspondence
between anomalous boundary states, which provides a new way to explore the
quantum anomaly of symmetry from its crystalline equivalent counterpart. We
show such correspondence directly in two scenarios, including the anomalous
symmetry-enriched topological orders (SET) and critical surface states. (1)
First of all, for the surface SET correspondence, we demonstrate it by
considering examples involving time-reversal symmetry and mirror symmetry. We
show that one 2D topological order can carry the time reversal anomaly as long
as it can carry the mirror anomaly and vice versa, by directly establishing the
mapping of the time reversal anomaly indicators and mirror anomaly indicators.
Besides, we also consider other cases involving continuous symmetry, which
leads us to introduce some new anomaly indicators for symmetry from its
counterpart. (2) Furthermore, we also build up direct correspondence for (near)
critical boundaries. Again taking topological phases protected by time reversal
and mirror symmetry as examples, the direct correspondence of their (near)
critical boundaries can be built up by coupled chain construction that was
first proposed by Senthil and Fisher. The examples of critical boundary
correspondence we consider in this paper can be understood in a unified
framework that is related to \textit{hierarchy structure} of topological $O(n)$
nonlinear sigma model, that generalizes the Haldane's derivation of $O(3)$
sigma model from spin one-half system.

<h3>Collective neural network behavior in a dynamically driven disordered  system of superconducting loops</h3>

Collective properties of complex systems composed of many interacting
components such as neurons in our brain can be modeled by artificial networks
based on disordered systems. We show that a disordered neural network of
superconducting loops with Josephson junctions can exhibit computational
properties like categorization and associative memory in the time evolution of
its state in response to information from external excitations. Superconducting
loops can trap multiples of fluxons in many discrete memory configurations
defined by the local free energy minima in the configuration space of all
possible states. A memory state can be updated by exciting the Josephson
junctions to allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current
through them surpasses their critical current thresholds. Simulations performed
with a lumped element circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information
written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux
and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on a high-Tc
superconductor YBCO-based 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in
each pathway characterized by the correlations between junction firing
statistics. Neural network behavior is observed as energy barriers separating
state categories in simulations in response to multiple excitations, and
experimentally as junction responses characterizing different flux flow
patterns in the network. The state categories that produce these patterns have
different temporal stabilities relative to each other and the excitations. This
provides strong evidence for time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories, that
are dependent on the geometrical and junction parameters of the loops, as
described with a network model.

<h3>Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation</h3>

We propose a model to describe the fluctuations in the internal magnetic
field due to ion dynamics observed in the muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) by an
Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function that separates the quasi-static
and dynamic components of the correlation by a parameter $Q$ (where $0\le
Q\le1$). Our Monte Carlo simulations for this model showed that the time
evolution of muon spin polarization deviates significantly from the Kubo-Toyabe
(KT) function. To further validate the model, the results of simulations were
compared with the $\mu$SR spectra observed in a hybrid organic-inorganic
perovskite FAPbI$_3$ [with FA referring to HC(NH$_2)_2$], where local field
fluctuations associated with the rotational motion of FA molecules and
quasi-static fields from the PbI$_3$ lattice are presumed to coexist. The
least-squares curve fitting showed reasonable agreement with the model with
$Q=0.947(3)$, and the fluctuation frequency of the dynamical component was
obtained. This result opens the door to the possibility of experimentally
distinguishing fluctuations due to dynamics of ions around muons from those due
to self-diffusion of muons. Meanwhile, it suggests the need to carefully
consider the spin relaxation function when applying $\mu$SR to the issue of ion
dynamics.

When in a pristine state, gallium and its alloys have the largest interfacial
tensions of any liquid at room temperature. Nonetheless, applying as little as
0.8 V of electric potential across eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) placed
within aqueous NaOH (or other electrolyte) solution will cause the metal to
behave as if its interfacial tension is near zero. The mechanism behind this
phenomenon has remained poorly understood because NaOH dissolves the oxide
species, making it difficult to directly measure the concentration, thickness,
or chemical composition of the film that forms at the interface. In addition,
the oxide layers formed are atomically-thin. Here, we present a suite of
techniques which allow us to simultaneously measure both electrical and
interfacial properties as a function of applied electric potential, allowing
for new insights into the mechanisms which cause the dramatic decrease in
interfacial tension. A key discovery from this work is that the interfacial
tension displays hysteresis while lowering the applied potential. We combine
these observations with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to evaluate how
these changes in interfacial tension arise from chemical, electrical, and
mechanical changes on the interface, and close with ideas for how to build a
free energy model to predict these changes from first principles.

Extreme mechanical processes such as strong lattice distortion and bond
breakage during fracture are ubiquitous in nature and engineering, which often
lead to catastrophic failure of structures. However, understanding the
nucleation and growth of cracks is challenged by their multiscale
characteristics spanning from atomic-level structures at the crack tip to the
structural features where the load is applied. Molecular simulations offer an
important tool to resolve the progressive microstructural changes at crack
fronts and are widely used to explore processes therein, such as mechanical
energy dissipation, crack path selection, and dynamic instabilities (e.g.,
kinking, branching). Empirical force fields developed based on local
descriptors based on atomic positions and the bond orders do not yield
satisfying predictions of fracture, even for the nonlinear, anisotropic
stress-strain relations and the energy densities of edges. High-fidelity force
fields thus should include the tensorial nature of strain and the energetics of
rare events during fracture, which, unfortunately, have not been taken into
account in both the state-of-the-art empirical and machine-learning force
fields. Based on data generated by first-principles calculations, we develop a
neural network-based force field for fracture, NN-F$^3$, by combining
pre-sampling of the space of strain states and active-learning techniques to
explore the transition states at critical bonding distances. The capability of
NN-F$^3$ is demonstrated by studying the rupture of h-BN and twisted bilayer
graphene as model problems. The simulation results confirm recent experimental
findings and highlight the necessity to include the knowledge of electronic
structures from first-principles calculations in predicting extreme mechanical
processes.

We focus on the biorthogonal work statistics of the interacting many-body
Hatano-Nelson model after switching on the imaginary vector potential. We
introduce a generalized Loschmidt echo $G(t)$ utilizing the biorthogonal metric
operator. It is well suited for numerical analysis and its Fourier transform
yields the probability distribution of work done. The statistics of work
displays several universal features, including an exponential decay with the
square of both the system size and imaginary vector potential for the
probability to stay in the ground state. Additionally, its high energy tail
follows a universal power law with exponent $-3$. This originates from the
peculiar temporal power law decay of $G(t)$ with a time dependent exponent. The
mean and the variance of work scale linearly and logarithmically with system
size while all higher cumulants are non-extensive. Our results are relevant for
non-unitary field theories as well.

The unique discovery of magnetic exciton in van der Waals antiferromagnet
NiPS3 arises between two quantum many-body states of a Zhang-Rice singlet
excited state and a Zhang-Rice triplet ground state. Simultaneously, the
spectral width of photoluminescence originating from this exciton is
exceedingly narrow as 0.4 meV. These extraordinary properties, including the
extreme coherence of the magnetic exciton in NiPS3, beg many questions. We
studied doping effects using Ni1-xCdxPS3 using two experimental techniques and
theoretical studies. Our experimental results show that the magnetic exciton is
drastically suppressed upon a few % Cd doping. All these happen while the width
of the exciton only gradually increases, and the antiferromagnetic ground state
is robust. These results highlight the lattice uniformity's hidden importance
as a prerequisite for coherent magnetic exciton. Finally, an exciting scenario
emerges: the broken charge transfer forbids the otherwise uniform formation of
the coherent magnetic exciton in (Ni,Cd)PS3.

Solid-state electrolytes with argyrodite structures, such as
$\mathrm{Li_6PS_5Cl}$, have attracted considerable attention due to their
superior safety compared to liquid electrolytes and higher ionic conductivity
than other solid electrolytes. Although experimental efforts have been made to
enhance conductivity by controlling the degree of disorder, the underlying
diffusion mechanism is not yet fully understood. Moreover, existing theoretical
analyses based on ab initio MD simulations have limitations in addressing
various types of disorder at room temperature. In this study, we directly
investigate Li-ion diffusion in $\mathrm{Li_6PS_5Cl}$ at 300 K using
large-scale, long-term MD simulations empowered by machine learning potentials
(MLPs). To ensure the convergence of conductivity values within an error range
of 10%, we employ a 25 ns simulation using a $5\times5\times5$ supercell
containing 6500 atoms. The computed Li-ion conductivity, activation energies,
and equilibrium site occupancies align well with experimental observations.
Notably, Li-ion conductivity peaks when Cl ions occupy 25% of the 4c sites,
rather than at 50% where the disorder is maximized. This phenomenon is
explained by the interplay between inter-cage and intra-cage jumps. By
elucidating the key factors affecting Li-ion diffusion in
$\mathrm{Li_6PS_5Cl}$, this work paves the way for optimizing ionic
conductivity in the argyrodite family.

This study numerically investigates the nonlinear interaction of head-on
solitary waves in a granular chain (a nonintegrable system) and compares the
simulation results with the theoretical results in fluid (an integrable
system). Three stages (i.e., pre-in-phase traveling stage, central-collision
stage, and post-in-phase traveling stage) are identified to describe the
nonlinear interaction processes in the granular chain. The nonlinear scattering
effect occurs in the central-collision stage, which decreases the amplitude of
incident solitary waves. Compared with the leading-time phase in the incident
and separation collision processes, the lagging-time phase in the separation
collision process is smaller. This asymmetrical nonlinear collision results in
an occurrence of leading phase shifts of time and space in the post-in-phase
traveling stage. We next find that solitary wave amplitude does not influence
the immediate space-phase shift in the granular chain. The space$-$phase shift
of the post-in-phase traveling stage is only determined by measurement position
rather than wave amplitude. The results are reversed in the fluid. An increase
in solitary wave amplitude leads to decreased attachment, detachment and
residence times for granular chain and fluid. For the immediate time-phase
shift, leading and lagging phenomena appear in the granular chain and the
fluid, respectively. These results offer new knowledge for designing mechanical
metamaterials and energy-mitigating systems.

<h3>Interlayer Conductance in the Armchair Nanotube -- Zigzag Graphene  Ribbon Parallel Contact: Theoretical Proposal of Detection of Wavefunction  Growing from the Edge to the Center in the Graphene Ribbon</h3>

Sublattices A and B are opposite in the decay direction of the edge state of
the zigzag graphene ribbon (ZGR). Detecting exponential growth from the zigzag
edges to the ZGR center remains challenging. The tight-binding model
calculations in this letter reveal that interlayer conductance manifests this
growth in parallel contact with the armchair nanotube. The transfer integrals
of oblique interlayer bonds are comparable to those of vertical interlayer
bonds. However, the phase of the ZGR wave function strongly suppresses the
contribution of oblique bonds, allowing the selective detection of the growing
component.

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnetism-induced spin splittings--even without atomic spin-orbit
coupling--are promising for highly efficient spintronics applications. Although
two-dimensional (2D) centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic materials are abundant,
they have not received extensive research attention owing to PT
symmetry-enforced net zero spin polarization and magnetization. Here, we
demonstrate a paradigm to harness nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) by
twisting the bilayer of type-III centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. We predict
by first-principles simulations and symmetry analysis on prototypes MnPSe3 and
MnSe antiferromagnets (in the monolayer limit) that Rashba-Dresselhaus and
Zeeman-like NRSSs arise along specific paths in the Brillouin zone. The
strength of Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting (up to $~\sim$90 meV{\AA})
induced by twisting is comparable to that of spin-orbit coupling. The results
also demonstrate how applying biaxial strain and a perpendicular electric field
could be envisaged to tune the magnitude of NRSS. The findings reveal the
untapped potential of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets and thus expand the
materials to look for spintronics.

Molecular magnetism aims to design materials with unique properties at the
molecular level, focusing on the systematic synthesis of new chemical
compounds. In this paper, we propose an alternative route to engineer molecular
magnetic materials through plasma irradiation. Our research indicates that the
long-range magnetic order temperature in the three-dimensional
$\mathrm{\{[Mn^{II}(H_2O)_2]_2[Nb^{IV}(CN)_8]\cdot 4H_2O\}_n}$ molecular
ferrimagnet increases by 20 K after plasma treatment. The core structure of the
compound does not reveal significant changes after plasma processing, as
confirmed by the X-ray powder diffraction analysis. The observed results are
attributed to the release of crystallized water molecules. The described
procedure can serve as a viable approach to altering the magnetic properties of
the molecular systems.

<br>
<br>
The nanoscopic magnetic texture forming in a monolayer of iron on the (111)
surface of iridium, Fe/Ir(111), is spatially modulated and uniaxially
incommensurate with respect to the crystallographic periodicities. As a
consequence, a low-energy magnetic excitation is expected that corresponds to
the sliding of the texture along the incommensurate direction, i.e., a phason
mode, which we explicitly confirm with atomistic spin simulations. Using
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we succeed to observe this phason mode
experimentally. It can be excited by the STM tip, which leads to a random
telegraph noise in the tunneling current that we attribute to the presence of
two minima in the phason potential due to the presence of disorder in our
sample. This provides the prospect of a floating phase in cleaner samples and,
potentially, a commensurate-incommensurate transition as a function of external
control parameters.

<h3>Anomalous tensile strength and thermal expansion, and low thermal  conductivity in wide band gap boron monoxide monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19485</a>

<i>Bohayra Mortazavi, Fazel Shojaei, Fei Ding, Xiaoying Zhuang</i>
<br>
<br>
Most recently the formation of boron monoxide (BO) in the two-dimensional
(2D) form has been confirmed experimentally (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145,
14660). Motivated by the aforementioned finding, herein we theoretically
explore the key physical properties of the single-layer and suspended BO.
Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that BO monolayer yields a large
indirect band gap of 3.78 (2.18) eV on the basis of HSE06(PBE) functional.
Ab-initio molecular dynamics results reveal the remarkable thermal stability of
the BO monolayer at 1000 K. The thermal and mechanical properties at room
temperature are furthermore investigated using a machine learning interatomic
potential (MLIP). The developed MLIP-based model close to the ground state
could very precisely reproduce the DFT predictions for the mechanical
properties of the BO monolayer. The elastic modulus, tensile strength and
lattice thermal conductivity of the BO monolayer at room temperature are
predicted to be 107 GPa, 25 GPa and 5.6 W/mK, respectively. At the room
temperature the BO monolayer is noticeably predicted to yield an ultrahigh
negative thermal expansion coefficient, by almost 17 folds larger than that of
the single-layer graphene. The presented results reveal the large indirect
electronic band gap, decent thermal and dynamical stability, anomalously low
elastic modulus to tensile strength ratio, ultrahigh negative thermal expansion
coefficients and low lattice thermal conductivity of the BO monolayer.

<h3>Three-Dimensional Spontaneous Flow Transition in a Homeotropic Active  Nematic</h3>

<br>
<i>Vincenzo J. Pratley, Enej Caf, Miha Ravnik, Gareth P. Alexander</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the three-dimensional spontaneous flow transition of an active
nematic in an infinite slab geometry using a combination of numerics and
analytics. We show that it is determined by the interplay of two eigenmodes --
called S- and D-mode -- that are unstable at the same activity threshold and
spontaneously breaks both rotational symmetry and chiral symmetry. The onset of
the unstable modes is described by a non-Hermitian integro-differential
operator, which we determine their exponential growth rates from using
perturbation theory. The S-mode is the fastest growing. After it reaches a
finite amplitude, the growth of the D-mode is anisotropic, being promoted
perpendicular to the S-mode and suppressed parallel to it, forming a steady
state with a full three-dimensional director field and a well-defined
chirality. Lastly, we derive a model of the leading-order time evolution of the
system close to the activity threshold.

<h3>Interacting Kitaev Chain with $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supersymmetry</h3>

Lattice models with supersymmetry are known to exhibit a variety of
remarkable properties that do not exist in the relativistic models. In this
paper, we introduce an interacting generalization of the Kitaev chain of
Majorana fermions with $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry and investigate its
low-energy properties, paying particular attention to the ground-state
degeneracy and low-lying fermionic excitations. First, we establish the
existence of a phase with spontaneously broken supersymmetry and a phase
transition out of it with the help of variational arguments and the exact
ground state. We then develop, based on the superfield formalism, a simple
mean-field theory, in which the order parameters detect supersymmetry-breaking,
to understand the ground-state phases and low-lying Nambu-Goldstone fermions.
At the solvable point ({\em frustration-free point}), the exact ground state of
an open chain exhibits large degeneracy of the order of the system size, which
is attributed to the existence of a zero-energy domain wall (dubbed kink or
skink) separating the topological and trivial states of Majorana fermions. Our
results may shed new light on the intriguing ground-state properties of
supersymmetric lattice models.

Reticular materials, including metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic
frameworks, combine relative ease of synthesis and impressive range of
applications in various fields, from gas storage to biomedicine. Diverse
properties arise from the variation of building units, metal centers and
organic linkers, in an almost infinite chemical space. Such a variability
substantially complicates experimental design and promotes the use of
computational methods. In particular, the most successful artificial
intelligence algorithms for predicting properties of reticular materials are
atomic-level graph neural networks with optional domain knowledge. Nonetheless,
the data-driven inverse design utilizing such models suffers from incorporating
irrelevant and redundant features such as full atomistic graph and network
topology. In this study, we propose a new way of representing materials, aiming
to overcome the limitations of existing methods; the message passing is
performed on the coarse-grained crystal graph that comprises molecular building
units. We assess the predictive performance and energy efficiency of neural
networks built on different materials representations, including
composition-based and crystal-structure-aware models, to highlight the merits
of our approach. Coarse-grained crystal graph neural networks show decent
accuracy at low computational costs, making them a valuable alternative to
omnipresent atomic-level algorithms. Moreover, the presented models can be
successfully integrated into the inverse materials design pipeline as
estimators of the objective function. Overall, the coarse-grained crystal graph
framework aims to challenge the prevailing atomic-centric perspective on
reticular materials design.

<br>
<br>
Recent computational studies have predicted many new ternary nitrides,
revealing synthetic opportunities in this underexplored phase space. However,
synthesizing new ternary nitrides is difficult, in part because intermediate
and product phases often have high cohesive energies that inhibit diffusion.
Here, we report the synthesis of two new phases, calcium zirconium nitride
(CaZrN$_2$) and calcium hafnium nitride (CaHfN$_2$), by solid state metathesis
reactions between Ca$_3$N$_2$ and $M$Cl$_4$ ($M$ = Zr, Hf). Although the
reaction nominally proceeds to the target phases in a 1:1 ratio of the
precursors via Ca$_3$N$_2$ + $M$Cl$_4$ $\rightarrow$ Ca$M$N$_2$ + 2 CaCl$_2$,
reactions prepared this way result in Ca-poor materials (Ca$_xM_{2-x}$N$_2$,
$x<1$). A small excess of Ca$_3$N$_2$ (ca. 20 mol\%) is needed to yield
stoichiometric Ca$M$N$_2$, as confirmed by high-resolution synchrotron powder
X-ray diffraction. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies reveal that
nominally stoichiometric reactions produce Zr$^{3+}$ intermediates early in the
reaction pathway, and the excess Ca$_3$N$_2$ is needed to reoxidize Zr$^{3+}$
intermediates back to the Zr$^{4+}$ oxidation state of CaZrN$_2$. Analysis of
computationally-derived chemical potential diagrams rationalizes this synthetic
approach and its contrast from the synthesis of MgZrN$_2$. These findings
additionally highlight the utility of in situ diffraction studies and
computational thermochemistry to provide mechanistic guidance for synthesis.

<h3>Effective interaction between guest charges immersed in 2D jellium</h3>

<br>
<br>
The model under study is an infinite 2D jellium of pointlike particles with
elementary charge $e$, interacting via the logarithmic potential and in thermal
equilibrium at the inverse temperature $\beta$. Two cases of the coupling
constant $\Gamma\equiv \beta e^2$ are considered: the Debye-H\"uckel limit
$\Gamma\to 0$ and the free-fermion point $\Gamma=2$. In the most general
formulation, two guest particles, the one with charge $q e$ (the valence $q$
being an arbitrary integer) and the hard core of radius $\sigma>0$ and the
pointlike one with elementary charge $e$, are immersed in the bulk of the
jellium at distance $d\ge \sigma$. Two problems are of interest: the asymptotic
large-distance behavior of the excess charge density induced in the jellium and
the effective interaction between the guest particles. Technically, the induced
charge density and the effective interaction are expressed in terms of
multi-particle correlations of the pure (translationally invariant) jellium
system. It is shown that the separation form of the induced charge density onto
its radial and angle parts, observed previously in the limit $\Gamma\to 0$, is
not reproduced at the coupling $\Gamma=2$. Based on an exact expression for the
effective interaction between guest particles at $\Gamma=2$, oppositely
($q=0,-1,-2,\ldots$) charged guest particles always attract one another while
likely ($q=1,2,\ldots$) charged guest particles repeal one another up to a
certain distance $d$ between them and then the mutual attraction takes place up
to an infinite distance.

Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum
technologies, including quantum metrology and sensing. A promising strategy for
the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the
exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion
implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in
the diamond lattice. In this works we demonstrate an approach to increase the
density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a
hot target substrate (>550 {\deg}C). Our results show that, with respect to
room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the
vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond
to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles.
Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers was investigated on
diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions
revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and
magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.

Donor-acceptor (D-A) structured molecules are essential components in organic
electronics. The respective molecular structure of these molecules and their
synthesis are primarily determined by the intended area of application.
Typically, D-A molecules promote charge separation and transport in organic
photovoltaics (OPV) or organic field-effect transistors (OFET). D-A molecules
showing a larger twist angle between D and A units are, e.g., extremely
important for the development of high internal quantum efficiency in organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). A prototypical molecule of this D-A type is
DCzDCN (5-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)benzene-1,3-dinitrile). In most
cases, these molecules are only investigated regarding their electronic and
structural interaction in bulk aggregates but not in ultra-thin films supported
by a metallic substrate. Here, we present growth and electronic structure
studies of DCzDCN on a Cu(100) surface. In a complementary approach, through
the use of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STM and STS), we
were able to view both the adsorption geometry and the local electronic states
of the adsorbed molecules in direct comparison with the integral electronic
structure of the DCzDCN/CU(100) interface using Ultraviolet and Inverse
Photoemission Spectroscopy (UPS and IPS). The orientation of the molecules with
the donor part towards the substrate results in a chiral resolution at the
interface due to the molecular as well as the substrate symmetry and additional
strong molecular electrostatic forces. Thus, the formation of various
bulk-unlike homochiral structures and the appearance of hybrid interface states
(HIS) modifies the molecular electronic properties of the DCzDCN/Cu(100) system
significantly compared to that of a single DCzDCN molecule. This may be not
only useful for optoelectronic applications but also in organic spintronics.

In an equilibrium thermal environment, random elastic collisions between
background particles and a tracer establish the picture of Brownian motion
fulfilling the celebrated Einstein relation between diffusivity and mobility.
In nature, environments often comprise collections of autonomously moving
objects that exhibit fascinating non-equilibrium phenomena and are nowadays
termed active matter. We investigate experimentally the impact of an active
background on a passive tracer using vibrationally excited active particles.
They produce multiple correlated tapping collisions with the tracer, for which
a persistent memory emerges in the dynamics. The system is described by a
generalized active Einstein relation that constrains fluctuations, dissipation,
and effective activity, by taking the emerging tracer memory into account.
Since the resulting persistence can largely be tuned by the environmental
density and motility, our findings can be useful to engineer properties of
various active systems in biomedical applications, microfluidics, chemical
engineering, or swarm robotics.

<br>
<br>
To study the kinetics of phase separation in active matter systems, we
consider models that impose a Vicsek-type self-propulsion rule on otherwise
passive particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. Two types of
kinetics are of interest: one conserves the total momentum of all the
constituents and the other that does not. We carry out numerical simulations,
assisted by molecular dynamics, to obtain results on structural growth and
aging properties. Results from our studies, with various finite boxes, show
that there exist scalings with respect to the system sizes, in both quantities,
as in the standard passive cases. We have exploited this scaling picture to
accurately estimate the corresponding exponents, in the thermodynamically large
system size limit, for power-law time-dependences. It is shown that certain
analytical functions describe the behavior of these quantities quite
accurately, including the finite-size limits. Our results demonstrate that even
though the conservation of velocity has at best weak effects on the dynamics of
evolution in the thermodynamic limit, the finite-size behavior is strongly
influenced by the presence (or the absence) of it.

A glance at recent research on magnetism turns up a curious set of articles
discussing, or claiming evidence for, a state of matter called a quantum spin
liquid (QSL). These articles are notable in their invocation of exotic notions
of topological physics, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum numbers, anyon
statistics and gauge field theories. So what is a QSL and why do we need this
complicated technical vocabulary to describe it? Our aim in this article is to
introduce some of these concepts and provide a discussion of what a QSL is,
where it might occur in Nature and why it is of interest. As we'll see, this is
a rich subject which is still in development, and unambiguous evidence for the
realisation of the QSL state in a magnetic material remains hotly debated.
However, the payoff in terms of the special nature of quantum entanglement in
the QSL, and its diverse spectrum of unusual excitations and topological status
will (at least to some extent) justify the need to engage with some powerful,
occasionally abstract, technical material.

Counterfeiting threatens human health, social equity, national security and
global and local economies. Hardware-based cryptography that exploits physical
unclonable functions (PUFs) provides the means for secure identification and
authentication of products. While optical PUFs are among the hardest to
replicate, they suffer from low encoding capacity and often complex and
expensive read-out. Here we report PUF labels with nanoscale features and
optical responses that arise from the guided self-assembly of plasmonic
nanoparticles. Nanosphere lithography combined with DNA origami placement are
used to create tightly packed randomised nanoparticle assemblies. Nanoscale
variations within these assemblies define the scattering color of the
individual spots that are arranged in a hexagonal lattice with spacing down to
the optical resolution limit. Due to the nanoscale dimensions, the intrinsic
randomness of the particle assemblies and their resulting optical responses,
our PUFs are virtually impossible to replicate while they can be read-out with
economical 3D-printed hardware.

The absorption cross section of M\"{o}ssbauer radiation in magnetic liquids
is calculated, taking into consideration both translational and rotational
Brownian motion of magnetic nanoparticles. Stochastic reversals of their
magnetization are also regarded in the absence of external magnetic field. The
role of Brownian motion in ferrofluids is considered in the framework of the
diffusion theory, while for the magnetorheological fluids with large
nanoparticles it is done in the framework of the Langevin's approach. For
rotation we derived the equation analogous to Langevin's equation and gave the
corresponding correlation function. In both cases the equations for rotation
are solved in the approximation of small rotations during lifetime of the
excited state of M\"{o}ssbauer nuclei. The influence of magnetization
relaxations is studied with the aid of the Blume-Tjon model.

Van der Waals (vdW) magnets are promising owing to their tunable magnetic
properties with doping or alloy composition, where the strength of magnetic
interactions, their symmetry, and magnetic anisotropy can be tuned according to
the desired application. However, most of the vdW magnet based spintronic
devices are so far limited to cryogenic temperatures with magnetic anisotropies
favouring out-of-plane or canted orientation of the magnetization. Here, we
report room-temperature lateral spin-valve devices with strong in-plane
magnetic anisotropy of the vdW ferromagnet (Co0.15Fe0.85)5GeTe2 (CFGT) in
heterostructures with graphene. Magnetization measurements reveal above
room-temperature ferromagnetism in CFGT with a strong in-plane magnetic
anisotropy. Density functional theory calculations show that the magnitude of
the anisotropy depends on the Co concentration and is caused by the
substitution of Co in the outermost Fe layer. Heterostructures consisting of
CFGT nanolayers and graphene were used to experimentally realize basic building
blocks for spin valve devices such as efficient spin injection and detection.
The spin transport and Hanle spin precession measurements prove a strong
in-plane and negative spin polarization at the interface with graphene, which
is supported by the calculated spin-polarized density of states of CFGT. The
in-plane magnetization of CFGT at room temperature proves its usefulness in
graphene lateral spin-valve devices, thus opening further opportunities for
spintronic technologies.

The pursuit of achieving the maximum power in microscopic thermal engines has
gained increasing attention in recent studies of stochastic thermodynamics. We
employ the optimal control theory to study the performance of Brownian heat
engines and determine the optimal heat-engine cycles in generic damped
situation, which were previously known only in the overdamped and the
underdamped limits. These optimal cycles include two isothermal processes, two
adiabatic processes, and an extra isochoric relaxation process at the upper
stiffness constraint. Our results not only interpolate the optimal cycles
between the overdamped and the underdamped limits, but also determine the
appropriate friction coefficient of the Brownian heat engine to achieve the
maximum power. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of
high-performance Brownian heat engines in experimental setups.

<h3>Isolating the Nonlinear Optical Response of a MoS$_2$ Monolayer under  Extreme Screening of a Metal Substrate</h3>

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers, as two-dimensional (2D)
direct bandgap semiconductors, hold promise for advanced optoelectronic and
photocatalytic devices. Interaction with three-dimensional (3D) metals, like
Au, profoundly affects their optical properties, posing challenges in
characterizing the monolayer's optical responses within the semiconductor-metal
junction. In this study, using precise polarization-controlled final-state sum
frequency generation (FS-SFG), we successfully isolated the optical responses
of a MoS$_2$ monolayer from a MoS$_2$/Au junction. The resulting SFG spectra
exhibit a linear lineshape, devoid of A or B exciton features, attributed to
the strong dielectric screening and substrate induced doping. The linear
lineshape illustrates the expected constant density of states (DOS) at the band
edge of the 2D semiconductor, a feature often obscured by excitonic
interactions in week-screening conditions such as in a free-standing monolayer.
Extrapolation yields the onset of a direct quasiparticle bandgap of about
$1.65\pm0.20$ eV, indicating a strong bandgap renormalization. This study not
only enriches our understanding of the optical responses of a 2D semiconductor
in extreme screening conditions but also provides a critical reference for
advancing 2D semiconductor-based photocatalytic applications.

<h3>Dynamical renormalisation of a spin Hamiltonian via high-order nonlinear  magnonics</h3>

The macroscopic magnetic order in the ground state of solids is determined by
the spin-dependent Hamiltonian of the system. In the absence of external
magnetic fields, this Hamiltonian contains the exchange interaction, which is
of electrostatic origin, and the spin-orbit coupling, whose magnitude depends
on the atomic charge. Spin-wave theory provides a representation of the entire
spectrum of collective magnetic excitations, called magnons, assuming the
interactions to be constant and the number of magnons in the system negligible.
However, the electric field component of light is able to perturb electrostatic
interactions, charge distributions and, at the same time, can create a magnon
population. A fundamental open question therefore concerns the possibility to
optically renormalise the spin Hamiltonian. Here, we test this hypothesis by
using femtosecond laser pulses to resonantly pump electric-dipole-active pairs
of high-energy magnons near the edges of the Brillouin zone. The transient spin
dynamics reveals the activation and a surprising amplification of coherent
low-energy zone-centre magnons, which are not directly driven. Strikingly, the
spectrum of these low-energy magnons differs from the one observed in thermal
equilibrium, the latter being consistent with spin-wave theory. The light-spin
interaction thus results in a room-temperature renormalisation of the magnetic
Hamiltonian, with an estimated modification of the magnetic interactions by 10%
of their ground-state values. We rationalise the observation in terms of a
novel resonant scattering mechanism, in which zone-edge magnons couple
nonlinearly to the zone-centre modes. In a quantum mechanical model, we
analytically derive the corrections to the spectrum due to the photo-induced
magnon population, which are consistent with our experiments. Our results
present a milestone for an all-optical engineering of Hamiltonians.

While nanoscale semiconductor crystallites provide versatile fluorescent
materials for light-emitting devices, such nanocrystals suffer from the "dark
exciton"$\unicode{x2014}$an optically inactive electronic state into which the
nanocrystal relaxes before emitting. Recently, a theoretical mechanism was
discovered that can potentially defeat the dark exciton. The Rashba effect can
invert the order of the lowest-lying levels, creating a bright excitonic ground
state. To identify materials that exhibit this behavior, here we perform an
extensive high-throughput computational search of two large open-source
materials databases. Based on a detailed understanding of the Rashba mechanism,
we define proxy criteria and screen over 500,000 solids, generating 173
potential "bright-exciton" materials. We then refine this list with
higher-level first-principles calculations to obtain 28 candidates. To confirm
the potential of these compounds, we select five and develop detailed
effective-mass models to determine the nature of their lowest-energy excitonic
state. We find that four of the five solids (BiTeCl, BiTeI, Ga$_2$Te$_3$, and
KIO$_3$) can yield bright ground-state excitons. Our approach thus reveals
promising materials for future experimental investigation of bright-exciton
nanocrystals.

Y-kapellasite [Y3Cu9(OH)19Cl8] is a frustrated antiferromagnetic insulator
which remains paramagnetic down to a remarkably low N\'eel temperature of about
2 K. Having studied this material in the paramagnetic regime, in which phonons
are the only possible heat carriers, we report the observation of a planar
parallel thermal Hall effect coming unambiguously from phonons. This is an
advantage over the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidates {\alpha}-RuCl3 and
Na2Co2TeO6 where in principle other heat carriers can be involved [1-4]. As it
happens, Y-kapellasite undergoes a structural transition attributed to the
positional freezing of a hydrogen atom below about 33 K. Above this transition,
the global crystal symmetry forbids the existence of a planar parallel signal -
the same situation as in Na2Co2TeO6 and cuprates [3-5]. This points to the
notion of a local symmetry breaking at the root of the phonon Hall effect. In
this context, the advantage of Y-kapellasite over Na2Co2TeO6 (with high levels
of Na disorder and stacking faults) and cuprates (with high levels of disorder
coming from dopants and oxygen vacancies) is its clean structure, where the
only degree of freedom available for local symmetry breaking is this hydrogen
atom randomly distributed over six equivalent positions above 33 K. This
provides a specific and concrete case for the general idea of local symmetry
breaking leading to the phonon Hall effect in a wide range of insulators.

Using the Phonopy code based on VASP, calculations of phonon and thermodynamic

were determined. Electronic properties and Fermi level shifts as a result of
phase transformations of CsSnI3 were assessed using the HSE06 functional and
machine learning prediction. The values of the complex dielectric constant and
the refractive index of all phases of the CsSnI3 were determined.

Transition metal (TM) defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are a promising
platform for applications in quantum technology as some of these defects, e.g.
vanadium (V), allow for optical emission in one of the telecom bands. For other
defects it was shown that straining the crystal can lead to beneficial effects
regarding the emission properties. Motivated by this, we theoretically study
the main effects of strain on the electronic level structure and optical
electric-dipole transitions of the V defect in SiC. In particular we show how
strain can be used to engineer the g-tensor, electronic selection rules, and
the hyperfine interaction. Based on these insights we discuss optical Lambda
systems and a path forward to initializing the quantum state of strained TM
defects in SiC.

<h3>Quantum Oscillation Signatures of Fermi Arcs in Tunnel  Magnetoconductance</h3>

Fermi-arc surface states of Weyl semimetals exhibit a unique combination of
localization to a surface and connectivity to the bulk Weyl fermions that can
move along the localization direction. We predict anomalous quantum-oscillation
signatures of Fermi arcs in the tunnel mangetoconductance across an interface
between two Weyl semimetals. These oscillations stem from a momentum-space
analog of Aharonov-Bohm interference of electrons moving along the interface
Fermi arcs, driven by an external magnetic field normal to the interface. The
Fermi arcs' connectivity to the bulk enables their characterization via
transport normal to the interface, while their localization manifests in a
strong field-angle anisotropy of the oscillations. This combination
distinguishes these anomalous oscillations from conventional Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations and makes them identifiable even in complex oscillation spectra of
real materials.

We have carried out density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the
magnetic stability of both ferromagnetic (FM) and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM)
states in monolayer 1T-CrTe2. Our results show that the AFM order is lower in
energy and thus is the ground state. By tuning the lattice parameters, the AFM
order can transition to the FM order, in good agreement with experimental
observation. We observe a commensurate SDW alongside the previously predicted
CDW, and attribute the AFM order to the SDW. This results in distinct hole and
electron Fermi pockets and a pronounced optical anisotropy, suggesting
quasi-one-dimensional behavior in this material.

Due to quantum confinement, excitons in finite-sized crystals behave rather
differently than in bulk materials. We investigate the dependence of exciton
energies on the strength of the quantum confinement in finite-sized crystals.
The evolution of the energy levels of hydrogen-like excitons in the crossover
region from weak to strong parabolic confinement is analyzed for different
quantum numbers by numerical solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger
equation. The energy spectrum of hydrogen-like excitons in Cu$_{2}$O-based
rectangular quantum wells (QWs) is, in turn, numerically obtained from the
solution of the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation as a function of the
QW width. Various crossings and avoided crossings of energy levels are observed
and categorized based on the symmetry properties of the exciton wave function.
Particular attention is paid to the two limiting cases of narrow (strong
confinement) and wide quantum wells (weak confinement).

We report a set of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS)
experiments studying native defects in CVT grown 1T-TaS$_2$. Six different
sample surfaces from four bulk crystals were investigated. Wide area imaging
reveals a prevalence of nanometer-scale electronic inhomogeneities due to
native defects, with pristine regions interspersed. These inhomogeneities
appear in typical as-grown crystals and coexist with a well-formed commensurate
charge density wave of 1T-TaS$_2$ at low temperatures. Electronic
inhomogeneities show up both as variations in the apparent height in STM and in
the local density of states in STS; the bands can shift by 60 meV and the gap
varies by more than 100 meV across inhomogeneities. These inhomogeneities are
present in similar concentration across large-scale areas of all samples
studied, but do not influence the charge density wave formation on local or
global scales. The commensurate charge density wave exhibits long-range order
and remains locally intact in the presence of these inhomogeneities.

The variety of correlated phenomena in moir\'e systems is incredibly rich,
spanning effects such as superconductivity, a generalized form of
ferromagnetism, or even charge fractionalization. This wide range of quantum
phenomena is partly enabled by the large number of internal degrees of freedom
in these systems, such as the valley and spin degrees of freedom, which
interplay decides the precise nature of the ground state. Identifying the
microscopic nature of the correlated states in the moir\'e systems is, however,
challenging, as it relies on interpreting transport behavior or
scanning-tunneling microscopy measurements. Here we show how the real-space
structure of collective charge oscillations of the correlated orders can
directly encode information about the structure of the correlated state,
focusing in particular on the problem of generalized Wigner crystals in moir\'e
transition metal dichalcogenides. Our analysis builds upon our earlier result
[10.1126/sciadv.adg3262] that the presence of a generalized Wigner crystal
modifies the plasmon spectrum of the system, giving rise to new collective
modes. We focus on scanning near-field optical microscopy technique (SNOM),
fundamentally a charge-sensing-based method, and introduce a regime under which
SNOM can operate as a probe of the spin degree of freedom.

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as the transition metal
dichalcogenides, have demonstrated tremendous promise for the development of
highly tunable quantum devices. Realizing this potential requires
low-resistance electrical contacts that perform well at low temperatures and
low densities where quantum properties are relevant. Here we present a new
device architecture for 2D semiconductors that utilizes a charge-transfer layer
to achieve large hole doping in the contact region, and implement this
technique to measure magneto-transport properties of high-purity monolayer
WSe$_2$. We measure a record-high hole mobility of 80,000 cm$^2$/Vs and access
channel carrier densities as low as $1.6\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, an order of
magnitude lower than previously achievable. Our ability to realize transparent
contact to high-mobility devices at low density enables transport measurement
of correlation-driven quantum phases including observation of a low temperature
metal-insulator transition in a density and temperature regime where Wigner
crystal formation is expected, and observation of the fractional quantum Hall
effect under large magnetic fields. The charge transfer contact scheme paves
the way for discovery and manipulation of new quantum phenomena in 2D
semiconductors and their heterostructures.
