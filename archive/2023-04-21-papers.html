<h3>Label-free, in situ monitoring of viscoelastic properties of cellular  monolayers via elastohydrodynamic phenomena</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09902</a>

Recent advances recognize that the viscoelastic properties of epithelial
structures play important roles in biology and disease modeling. However,
accessing the viscoelastic properties of multicellular structures in
mechanistic or drug-screening applications face challenges in repeatability,
accuracy, and practical implementation. Here, we present a microfluidic
platform that leverages elastohydrodynamic phenomena, sensed by graphene strain
sensors, to measure the viscoelasticity of cellular monolayer in situ, without
using labels or specialized equipment. We demonstrate platform utility with two
systems: cell dissociation following trypsinization, where viscoelastic
properties change over minutes, and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
where changes occur over days. These cellular events could only be resolved
with our platforms higher signal-to-noise ratio: relaxation times of 14.5 plus
or minus 0.4 s-1 for intact epithelial monolayers versus 13.4 plus or minus
15.0 s-1 in other platforms. By rapidly assessing combined contributions from
cell stiffness and intercellular interactions, we anticipate that the platform
will hasten translation of new mechanical biomarkers.

<h3>Accelerating analysis of Boltzmann equations using Gaussian mixture  models: Application to quantum Bose-Fermi mixtures</h3>

The Boltzmann equation is a powerful theoretical tool for modeling the
collective dynamics of quantum many-body systems subject to external
perturbations. Analysis of such a model gives access to linear response
properties such as collective modes and transport coefficients that
characterize a system, but often proves intractable due to computational costs
associated with multidimensional integrals describing collision processes.
Here, we present a method to resolve this bottleneck, enabling efficient study
of the linear response of a broad class of quantum many-body systems whose
behavior can be described using a Boltzmann equation. Specifically, we
demonstrate that a Gaussian mixture model can accurately represent equilibrium
distribution functions and, when combined with the variational method of
moments framework, allows efficient computation of collision integrals. We
apply this method to investigate the collective behavior of a quantum
Bose-Fermi mixture of cold atoms in a cigar-shaped trap, focusing on monopole
and quadrupole collective modes above the Bose-Einstein transition temperature.
We find a rich phenomenology that spans interference effects between bosonic
and fermionic collective modes, dampening of these modes, and the emergence of
hydrodynamics in various parameter regimes. Typical spectral functions exhibit
Fano interference profiles, systems with dilute fermions manifest behavior
reminiscent of Bose polarons, and systems with comparable bosonic and fermionic
densities display hallmarks of hydrodynamics such as mode-locking. These
effects are readily verifiable with modern cold-atom experiments, and the
method developed here opens the door to understanding the collective behavior
of many fundamental and technologically-relevant systems.

<h3>Subsystem Non-Invertible Symmetry Operators and Defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09886</a>
<br>
<i>Weiguang Cao, Linhao Li, Masahito Yamazaki, Yunqin Zheng</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore non-invertible symmetries in two-dimensional lattice models with
subsystem $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry. We introduce a subsystem $\mathbb
Z_2$-gauging procedure, called the subsystem Kramers-Wannier transformation,
which generalizes the ordinary Kramers-Wannier transformation. The
corresponding duality operators and defects are constructed by gaugings on the
whole or half of the Hilbert space. By gauging twice, we derive fusion rules of
duality operators and defects, which enriches ordinary Ising fusion rules with
subsystem features. Subsystem Kramers-Wannier duality defects are mobile in
both spatial directions, unlike the defects of invertible subsystem symmetries.
We finally comment on the anomaly of the subsystem Kramers-Wannier duality
symmetry, and discuss its subtleties.

<h3>Vison crystals, chiral and crystalline phases in the Yao-Lee model</h3>

We study the phase diagram of the Yao-Lee model with Kitaev-type spin-orbital
interactions in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and external
magnetic fields. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model can still be solved
exactly under these perturbations due to the enlarged local Hilbert space.
Through a variational analysis, we obtain a rich ground state phase diagram
that consists of a variety of vison crystals with periodic arrangements of
background Z2 flux (i.e. visons). With an out-of-plane magnetic field, these
phases have gapped bulk and chiral edge states, characterized by a Chern number
{\nu} and an associated chiral central charge c_{-} = {\nu}/2 of edge states.
We also find helical Majorana edge states that are protected by magnetic mirror
symmetry. Our results spotlight the tunability and the accompanying rich
physics in exactly-solvable spin-orbital generalizations of the Kitaev model.

<h3>Eigenvector Correlations Across the Localisation Transition in  non-Hermitian Power-Law Banded Random Matrices</h3>

Eigenvector correlations are a central ingredient in the understanding of the
dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study such correlations
across a localisation transition in non-Hermitian quantum systems. As a
concrete setting, we consider non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices
which have emerged as a promising platform for studying localisation in
disordered, non-Hermitian systems. We show that eigenvector correlations show
marked differences between the delocalised and localised phases. In the
delocalised phase, the eigenvectors are strongly correlated as evinced by
divergent correlations in the limit of vanishingly small complex eigenvalue
spacings. On the contrary, in the localised phase, the correlations are
independent of the eigenvalue spacings. We explain our results in the
delocalised phase by appealing to the Ginibre random matrix ensemble. On the
other hand, in the localised phase, an analytical treatment sheds light on the
suppressed correlations, relative to the delocalised phase. Given that
eigenvector correlations are fundamental ingredients towards understanding
real- and imaginary-time dynamics with non-Hermitian generators, our results
open a new avenue for characterising dynamical phases in non-Hermitian quantum
many-body systems.

<h3>$\mathbb Z_2$-Nontrivial Moiré Minibands and Interaction-Driven  Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators in Topological Insulator Based Moiré  Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09907" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09907</a>

We studied electronic band structure and topological property of a
topological insulator thin film under a moir\'e superlattice potential to
search for two-dimensional (2D) $\mathbb Z_2$ non-trivial isolated mini-bands.
To model this system, we assume the Fermi energy inside the bulk band gap and
thus consider an effective model Hamiltonian with only two surface states that
are located at the top and bottom surfaces and strongly hybridized with each
other. The moir\'e potential is generated by another layer of 2D insulating
materials on top of topological insulator films. In this model, the lowest
conduction (highest valence) mini-bands can be $\mathbb Z_2$ non-trivial when
the minima (maxima) of the moir\'e potential approximately forms a hexagonal
lattice with six-fold rotation symmetry. For the nontrivial conduction
mini-band cases, the two lowest Kramers' pairs of conduction mini-bands both
have nontrivial $\mathbb Z_2$ invariant in presence of inversion, while
applying external gate voltages to break inversion leads to only the lowest
Kramers' pair of mini-bands to be topologically non-trivial. The Coulomb
interaction can drive the lowest conduction Kramers' mini-bands into the
quantum anomalous Hall state when they are half-filled, which is further
stabilized by breaking inversion symmetry. We propose the monolayer Sb$_{2}$ on
top of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ thin films to realize our model based on results from the
first principles calculations.

<h3>Network effects lead to self-organization in metabolic cycles of  self-repelling catalysts</h3>

Mixtures of particles that interact through phoretic effects are known to
aggregate if they belong to species that exhibit attractive self-interactions.
We study self-organization in a model metabolic cycle composed of three species
of catalytically-active particles that are chemotactic towards the chemicals
that define their connectivity network. We find that the self-organization can
be controlled by the network properties, as exemplified by a case where a
collapse instability is achieved by design for self-repelling species. Our
findings highlight a possibility for controlling the intricate functions of
metabolic networks by taking advantage of the physics of phoretic active
matter.

After projection to the lowest Landau level translational invariance and
particle conservation combine into dipole symmetry. We show that the new
symmetry forbids spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at zero temperature. In
the case of the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, where the translational
invariance is absent, we show that the dipole symmetry disappears and the
constraint on the symmetry breaking is lifted. We pay special attention to the
fate of the Girvin-Macdonald-Platzman algebra in the inhomogeneous magnetic
field and show that a natural generalization of it is still present even though
the dipole symmetry is not.

<h3>Robust estimation of position-dependent anisotropic diffusivity tensors  from stochastic trajectories</h3>

Materials under confinement can possess properties that deviate considerably
from their bulk counterparts. Indeed, confinement makes all physical properties
position-dependent and possibly anisotropic, and characterizing such spatial
variations and directionality is an intense area of focus in experimental and
computational studies of confined matter. While this task is fairly
straightforward for simple mechanical observables, it is far more daunting for
transport properties such as diffusivity that can only be estimated from
autocorrelations of mechanical observables. For instance, there are well
established methods for estimating diffusivity from experimentally observed or
computationally generated trajectories in the bulk. No rigorous generalizations
of such methods, however, exist for confined systems. In this work, we present
two filtered covariance estimators for computing anisotropic and
position-dependent diffusivity tensors and validate them by applying them to
stochastic trajectories generated according to known diffusivity profiles.
These estimators can accurately capture spatial variations spanning over
several orders of magnitude and assuming different functional forms. Our
approach is also very robust to implementation details such as the localization
function and time discretization and performs significantly better than
estimators that are solely based on local covariance. Moreover, the kernel
function does not have to be localized and can instead belong to a dictionary
of orthogonal functions. Therefore, the proposed estimator can be readily used
to obtain functional estimates of diffusivity rather than a tabulated
collection of pointwise estimates. Nonetheless, the susceptibility of the
proposed estimators to time discretization is higher close to hard boundaries.
We demonstrate this heightened susceptibility to be common among all
covariance-based estimators.

<h3>Parity transition of spin-singlet superconductivity using sub-lattice  degrees of freedom</h3>

Recently, a superconducting (SC) transition from low-field (LF) to high-field
(HF) SC states was reported in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, indicating the existence of
multiple SC states. It has been theoretically noted that the existence of two
Ce sites in the unit cell, the so-called sub-lattice degrees of freedom owing
to the local inversion symmetry breaking at the Ce sites, can lead to the
appearance of multiple SC phases even under an interaction inducing
spin-singlet superconductivity. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is considered as the first
example of multiple SC phases owing to this sub-lattice degree of freedom.
However, microscopic information about the SC states has not yet been reported.
In this study, we measured the SC spin susceptibility at two
crystallographically inequivalent As sites using nuclear magnetic resonance for
various magnetic fields. Our experimental results strongly indicate a
spin-singlet state in both SC phases. In addition, the antiferromagnetic phase,
which appears within the SC phase, only coexists with the LF SC phase; there is
no sign of magnetic ordering in the HF SC phase. The present work reveals
unique SC properties originating from the locally noncentrosymmetric
characteristics.

<h3>Control of conductivity in Fe-rich cobalt-ferrite thin films with  perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10048" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10048</a>

<br>
<br>
We fabricated two types of cobalt-ferrite (001) thin films, insulative
Fe-rich cobalt-ferrite CoxFe3-xO4+{\delta} (I-CFO) and conductive Fe-rich
cobalt-ferrite CoyFe3-yO4 (C-CFO), with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)
on MgO (001) substrates. Although the stoichiometric cobalt-ferrite is known as
an insulating material, it is found that the conductivity of Fe-rich
cobalt-ferrites can be controlled by changing the source materials and
deposition conditions in the pulsed laser deposition technique. The I-CFO and
C-CFO films exhibit PMA through the in-plane lattice distortion. We
investigated the Fe-ion-specific valence states in both I-CFO and C-CFO films
by M\"ossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and found
that the difference in conductivity corresponds to the abundance ratio of Fe2+
state at the octahedral B-site (Oh) in the inverse spinel structure.
Furthermore, first-principles calculations reproduce the changes in the density
of states at the Fermi level depending on the cation vacancies at the B-site,
which explains the difference in the conductivity between I-CFO and C-CFO.

Density-potential functional theory (DPFT) is an alternative formulation of
orbital-free density functional theory that may be suitable for modeling the
electronic structure of large systems. To date, DPFT has been applied mainly to
quantum gases in one- and two dimensional settings. In this work, we study the
performance of DPFT when applied to real-life systems: atoms, dimers, and
nanoparticles. We build on systematic Suzuki-Trotter factorizations of the
quantum-mechanical propagator and on the Wigner function formalism,
respectively, to derive nonlocal as well as semilocal functional approximations
in complete analogy to their well-established lower-dimensional versions --
without resorting to system-specific approximations or ad-hoc measures of any
kind. The cost for computing the associated semiclassical ground-state
single-particle density scales (quasi-)linearly with particle number. We
illustrate that the developed density formulae become relatively more accurate
for larger particle numbers, can be improved systematically, are quite
universally applicable, and, hence, may offer alternatives to existing
orbital-free methods for mesoscopic quantum systems.

<h3>Observations of $ν=1$ Quantum Hall Effect and Inter-Band Effects of  Magnetic fields on Hall Conductivity in Organic Massless Dirac Fermion System  $α$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$ under Pressure</h3>

<br>

We investigated the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in an organic
massless Dirac fermion system $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$ under pressure. The
Fermi energy of this system is slightly far away from the Dirac points, and
thus the $\nu =1$ quantum Hall state is realized in a low magnetic field at low
temperatures. Moreover, the experimental formula for chemical potential as a
function of temperature is clarified. We succeeded in detecting the inter-band
effects of the magnetic field on the Hall conductivity when the chemical
potential passes the Dirac points.

The spin-orbital entangled states are of great interest as they hold exotic
phases and intriguing properties. Here we use first-principles calculations to
investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of RuI$_{3}$ and RuCl$_{3}$
in both bulk and monolayer cases. Our results show that RuI$_{3}$ bulk is a
paramagnetic metal, which is in agreement with recent experiments. We find that
the Ru$^{3+}$ ion of RuI$_{3}$ is in the spin-orbital entangled $j_{\rm
eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ state. More interestingly, a metal-insulator transition
occurs from RuI$_{3}$ bulk to monolayer, and this is mainly due to the band
narrowing with the decreasing lattice dimensionality and to the Ru-I
hybridization altered by the I $5p$ spin-orbit coupling. In contrast,
RuCl$_{3}$ bulk and monolayer both show Mott-insulating behavior, the Ru$^{3+}$
ion is in the formal $S=\frac{1}{2}$ and $L=1$ state with a large in-plane
orbital moment, and this result well explains the experimental large effective
magnetic moment of RuCl$_{3}$ and the strong in-plane magnetization. The
present work demonstrates the contrasting spin-orbital states and the varying
properties of RuI$_{3}$ and RuCl$_{3}$.

<h3>Chern numbers associated with the periodic Toda lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The periodic Toda lattice can be solved by exploiting the spectral properties
of the Lax operator, where boundary states play an important role. We show that
such boundary states have a topological origin similar to the edge states in
topological insulators, and consequently, bulk wave functions of the Lax
operator yield nontrivial Chern numbers. This implies that the periodic Toda
lattice belongs to the same topological class as the Thouless pump. We
demonstrate that the cnoidal wave of the Toda lattice shows Chern number $-1$
per period.

Vibrational spectroscopy is the most effective, efficient and informative
method of structural analysis of amorphous materials with silica matrix and,
therefore, an indispensable tool for examining silicon oxycarbide-based
amorphous materials (SiOC). The subject of this work is a description of the
modification process of SiOC glasses with phosphate ions based on the
structural examination including mainly Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy. They
were obtained as polymer-derived ceramics based on ladder-like silsesquioxanes
synthesised via the sol-gel method. With the high phosphate's volatility, it
was decided to introduce the co-doping ions to create [AlPO4] and [BPO4] stable
structural units. As a result, several samples from the SiPOC, SiPAlOC and
SiPBOC systems were obtained with various quantities of the modifiers. All
samples underwent a detailed structural evaluation of both polymer precursors
and ceramics after high-temperature treatment with Fourier-transformed infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and magic
angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR). Obtained results proved
the efficient preparation of desired materials that exhibit structural
parameters similar to the unmodified one. They were X-ray-amorphous with no
phase separation and crystallisation. Spectroscopic measurements confirmed the
presence of the crucial Si-C bond and how modifying ions are incorporated into
the SiOC network. It was also possible to characterise the turbostratic free
carbon phase. The modification was aimed to improve the bioperformance of the
materials in the context of their future application as bioactive coatings on
metallic implants.

4th Generation high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactors (HTGR) are
regarded as possible sources of industrial heat in Poland and Europe, allowing
for a substantial reduction of the dependency on gas and coal import. It is
mainly due to their safety of use, reliability and economy in a current
energetic crisis. In this work, graphite, as a primary construction material
and neutron moderator in HTGR, was evaluated before and after ion irradiation
since its properties depend on the material's structure and purity. Commercial
graphite materials (IG-110, NBG-17) and the laboratory's in-home material were
chosen for the exemplary samples. The structural damage in HTGR was simulated
with energetic Ar+ and He+ ions with fluencies from 1E12 to 2E17 ion/cm2. Raman
imaging was chosen to assess radiation damage build-up: the crystallites'
evolution, occurrence and types of defects. The recorded evolution showed
stronger disordering of the material with heavier Ar+ ions than with He+.

<h3>Magnetic and transport anomalies and large magnetocaloric effect in  cubic R4PtAl (R = Ho and Er)</h3>

<br>
We report the electronic properties of R4PtAl (R = Ho, and Er), which
contains 3 sites for R, by the measurements of magnetization (ac and dc),
heat-capacity, transport, and magnetoresistance (MR). Dc magnetization data
reveal antiferromagnetic order below 19 K and 12 K in Ho and Er compounds,
respectively. Additional features observed at lower temperatures (12 K for
Ho4PtAl and 5 K for Er4PtAl) are akin to cluster spin-glass phase. Resistivity
data exhibit a weak minimum at a temperature marginally higher than their
respective N\'eel temperature (T_N) which is unusual for such rare-earths with
well localized 4f states. Isothermal magnetization and magnetoresistance data
well below T_N exhibit signatures of a subtle field-induced magnetic transition
for a small magnetic field (less than 10 kOe). Notably, the isothermal entropy
change at T_N has the largest peak value within this rare-earth family; for a
field change from zero to 50 kOe, the entropy change is about 14.5 J/kg K
(Ho4PtAl) and 21.5 J/kg K (Er4PtAl) suggesting a role of anisotropy of 4f
orbital in determining this large value. The results provide some clues for the
advancement of the field of magnetocaloric effect. The magnetocaloric property
of Er4PtAl is nonhysteretic meeting a challenge to find materials with
reversible magnetocaloric effect.

containing 3 sites for rare-earth (R), by several bulk measurements down to 1.8
K. This work is motivated by the fact that the isostructural Dy compound in the
R4PtAl family surprisingly orders ferromagnetically unlike other members of
this series, which order antiferromagnetically. The results reveal that the
title compound undergoes antiferromagnetic order at about 18 K, similar to
other heavy R members of R4RhAl family, unlike its Pt counterpart, indicating a
subtle difference in the role of conduction electrons to decide magnetism of
these compounds. Besides, spin-glass features coexisting with antiferromagnetic
order could be observed, which could mean cluster antiferromagnetism. The
electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance behaviours in the magnetically
ordered state are typical of magnetic materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic
gap. Features attributable to spin-reorientation as a function of temperature
and magnetic field can be seen in the magnetization data.

The Haldane-spin chain compound, Tb2BaNiO5, has been known to be an exotic
multiferroic system, exhibiting antiferromagnetic anomalies at T_N1= 63 K and
T_N2= 25 K, with ferroelectricity appearing below T_N2 only. Previous reports
in addition established that, interestingly, Tb ions play a direct and decisive
role to lead to multiferroic properties with a critical canting angle of
magnetic moments, unlike other well-known multiferroics. Here, we report the
results of temperature dependent neutron powder diffraction studies on Tb_2-x
Y_x BaNiO_5, to get an insight into the critical canting angle for multiferroic
behavior. While multiferroic transition temperature decreases linearly with Y
concentration, there is an abrupt drop of relative canting angle (of Tb and Ni
magnetic moments) with respect to that in parent compound for an initial
substitution ofx = 0.5 in the multiferroic region, without any notable change
thereafter. We therefore infer that this critical canting angle is made up of
two components - cooperative (long-range) and local (short-range)
contributions.

<h3>Renormalization theory of disordered contact processes with heavy-tailed  dispersal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by long-range dispersal in ecological systems, we formulate and
apply a general strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) framework to
describe one-dimensional disordered contact processes with heavy-tailed, such
as power law, stretched exponential, and log-normal dispersal kernels, widely
used in ecology. The focus is on the close-to-critical scaling of the order
parameters, including the commonly used density, as well as the less known
persistence, which is non-zero in the inactive phase. Our analytic and
numerical results obtained by SDRG schemes at different levels of approximation
reveal that the more slowly decaying dispersal kernels lead to more smoothly
vanishing densities as the critical point is approached. The persistence,
however, shows an opposite tendency: the broadening of the dispersal makes its
decline more singular at the critical point, becoming discontinuous for the
extreme case of power-law dispersal. The SDRG schemes presented here also
describe the quantum phase transition of random transverse-field Ising chains
with ferromagnetic long-range interactions, the density corresponding to the
magnetization of this model.

We study the liquid--hexatic transition of soft disks with massively parallel
simulations and determine the equation of state as a function of system size.
For systems with interactions decaying as the inverse $m$th power of the
separation, the liquid--hexatic phase transition is continuous for $m = 12$ and
$m=8$, while it is of first order for $m = 24$. The critical power $m$ for the
transition between continuous and first-order behavior is larger than
previously reported. The continuous transition for $ m=12 $ implies that the
two-dimensional Lennard-Jones model has a continuous liquid--hexatic transition
at high temperatures. We also study the Weeks--Chandler--Andersen model and
find a continuous transition at high temperatures, that is consistent with the
soft-disk case for $m=12$. Pressure data as well as our implementation are
available from an open-source repository.

Semiconductor quantum dot molecules are considered as promising candidates
for quantum technological applications due to their wide tunability of optical
properties and coverage of different energy scales associated with charge and
spin physics. While previous works have studied the tunnel-coupling of the
different excitonic charge complexes shared by the two quantum dots by
conventional optical spectroscopy, we here report on the first demonstration of
a coherently controlled inter-dot tunnel-coupling focusing on the quantum
coherence of the optically active trion transitions. We employ ultrafast
four-wave mixing spectroscopy to resonantly generate a quantum coherence in one
trion complex, transfer it to and probe it in another trion configuration. With
the help of theoretical modelling on different levels of complexity we give an
instructive explanation of the underlying coupling mechanism and dynamical
processes.

<br>
The magnetic, noncollinear parametrization of Dudarev's DFT+$U$ method is
generalized to fully-relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials. We present the
definition of the DFT+$U$ total energy functional, and the calculation of
forces and stresses in the case of orthogonalized atomic orbitals defining the
localised Hubbard manifold, where additional contributions arising from the
derivative of the inverse square root of the overlap matrix appear. We further
extend the perturbative calculation of the Hubbard $U$ parameters within
density-functional perturbation theory to the noncollinear relativistic case,
by exploiting an existing and recently developed theoretical approach that
takes advantage of the time-reversal operator to solve a second Sternheimer
equation. We validate and apply the new scheme by studying the electronic
structure and the thermodynamics of the binary compounds EuX (where X = O, S,
Se, Te is a chalcogen atom), as representative simple crystals, and of the
pyrochlore Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$, representative of a more structurally complex
oxide.

Cubic chiral magnets exhibit a remarkable diversity of two-dimensional
topological magnetic textures, including skyrmions. However, the experimental
confirmation of topological states localized in all three spatial dimensions
remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate a three-dimensional
topological state called a heliknoton, which is a hopfion embedded into a helix
or conic background. We explore the range of parameters at which the heliknoton
can be stabilized under realistic conditions using micromagnetic modeling,
harmonic transition state theory, and stochastic spin dynamics simulations. We
present theoretical Lorentz TEM images of the heliknoton, which can be used for
experimental comparison. Additionally, we discuss the stability of the
heliknoton at finite temperatures and the mechanism of its collapse. Our study
offers a pathway for future experimental investigations of three-dimensional
topological solitons in magnetic crystals.

<br>
<br>
PbTe nanowires coupled to a superconductor have recently been proposed as a
potential Majorana platform. The hallmark of the one-dimensional nature of
ballistic nanowires is their quantized conductance. Here, we report the
observation of conductance plateaus at multiples of the quantized value
$2e^2/h$ in PbTe nanowires at finite magnetic fields. The quantized plateaus,
as a function of source-drain bias and magnetic field, allow for the extraction
of the Land\'e $g$-factor, sub-band spacing and effective mass. The coefficient
of 2 in the plateau conductance indicates the presence of valley degeneracy
arising from the crystal orientation of the nanowires, which are grown on a
(001) substrate. Occasionally, this degeneracy can be lifted by a gate voltage
that breaks the mirror symmetry. Our results demonstrate the one-dimensionality
of PbTe nanowires and fulfill one of the necessary conditions for the
realization of Majorana zero modes.

<br>
<br>
The insulator-metal transition in Mott insulators, known as the Mott
transition, is usually accompanied with various novel quantum phenomena, such
as unconventional superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid behavior and colossal
magnetoresistance. Here, based on high-pressure electrical transport and XRD
measurements, and first-principles calculations, we find that a unique
pressure-induced Mott transition from an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator to a
ferromagnetic Weyl metal in the iron oxychalcogenide La2O3Fe2Se2 occurs around
37 GPa without structural phase transition. Our theoretical calculations reveal
that such an insulator-metal transition is mainly due to the enlarged bandwidth
and diminishing of electron correlation at high pressure, fitting well with the
experimental data. Moreover, the high-pressure ferromagnetic Weyl metallic
phase possesses attractive electronic band structures with six pairs of Weyl
points close to the Fermi level, and its topological property can be easily
manipulated by the magnetic field. The emergence of Weyl fermions in
La2O3Fe2Se2 at high pressure may bridge the gap between nontrivial band
topology and Mott insulating states. Our findings not only realize
ferromagnetic Weyl fermions associated with the Mott transition, but also
suggest pressure as an effective controlling parameter to tune the emergent
phenomena in correlated electron systems.

<br>
One of the key challenges for spintronic and novel quantum technologies is to
achieve active control of the spin angular momentum of electrons in nanoscale
materials on ultrafast, femtosecond timescales. While conventional
ferromagnetic materials and materials supporting spin texture suffer both from
conceptional limitations in miniaturization and in efficiency of optical and
electronic manipulation, non-magnetic centrosymmetric layered materials with
hidden spin polarization may offer an alternative pathway to manipulate the
spin degree of freedom by external stimuli. Here we demonstrate a novel
approach to generate transient spin polarization on a femtosecond timescale in
the otherwise spin-unpolarized band structure of the centrosymmetric 2H-stacked
group VI transition metal dichalcogenide WSe$_{2}$. Using ultrafast optical
excitation of a fullerene layer grown on top of WSe$_{2}$, we trigger an
ultrafast interlayer electron transfer from the fullerene layer into the
WSe$_{2}$ crystal. The resulting transient charging of the C$_{60}$/WSe$_{2}$
interface leads to a substantial interfacial electric field that by means of
spin-layer-valley locking ultimately creates ultrafast spin polarization
without the need of an external magnetic field. Our findings hence open a novel
pathway for optically engineering spin functionalities such as the
sub-picosecond generation and manipulation of ultrafast spin currents in 2D
heterostructures.

<h3>Extending intergranular normal-stress distributions using symmetries of  isotropic linear-elastic polycrystalline materials</h3>

<i>S. El Shawish</i>
<br>
<br>
Intergranular normal stresses (INS) are critical in the initiation and
evolution of grain boundary damage in polycrystalline materials. To model the
effects of such microstructural damage on a macroscopic scale, knowledge of INS
is usually required statistically at each representative volume element
subjected to various loading conditions. However, calculating INS distributions
for different stress states can be time-consuming. This study proposes a new
method to extend existing INS distributions to arbitrary loading conditions
using the symmetries of isotropic linear-elastic polycrystalline materials. The
method relies on a fact that INS distributions can be accurately reproduced
from the first (typically) ten statistical moments, which depend trivially on
just two deviatoric-stress invariants and a few material invariants due to
assumed isotropy and linearity of the polycrystalline model. While these
material invariants are complex averages, they can be extracted numerically
from a few existing INS distributions and tabulated for later use. Practically,
only two such INS distributions at properly selected loadings are required to
provide all relevant material invariants for the first 11 statistical moments,
which can then be used to reconstruct the INS distribution for arbitrary
loading conditions. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be accurate and
feasible for an arbitrarily selected linear-elastic material under various
loading conditions.

<h3>Correlations at higher-order exceptional points in non-Hermitian models</h3>

We investigate the decay of spatial correlations of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
non-Hermitian one-dimensional models that host higher-order exceptional points.
Beyond a certain correlation length, they develop anomalous power-law behavior
that indicates strong suppression of correlations in the non-Hermitian setups
as compared to the Hermitian ones. The correlation length is also reflected in
the entanglement entropy where it marks a change from logarithmic growth at
short distance to a constant value at large distance, characteristic of an
insulator, despite the spectrum being gapless. Two different families of models
are investigated, both having a similar spectrum constrained by particle-hole
symmetry. The first model offers an experimentally attractive way to generate
arbitrary higher-order exceptional points and represents a non-Hermitian
extension of the Dirac Hamiltonian for general spin. At the critical point it
displays a decay of the correlations $\sim 1/x^2$ and $1/x^3$ irrespective of
the order of the exceptional point. The second model is constructed using
unidirectional hopping and display enhanced suppression of correlations $\sim
1/x^a$, $a\ge 2$ with a power law that depends on the order of the exceptional
point.

High-quality free-standing InAs nanosheets are emerging layered semiconductor
materials with potentials in designing planar Josephson junction devices for
novel physics studies due to their unique properties including strong
spin-orbit couplings, large Land\'e g-factors and the two dimensional nature.
Here, we report an experimental study of proximity induced superconductivity in
planar Josephson junction devices made from free-standing InAs nanosheets. The
nanosheets are grown by molecular beam epitaxy and the Josephson junction
devices are fabricated by directly contacting the nanosheets with
superconductor Al electrodes. The fabricated devices are explored by
low-temperature carrier transport measurements. The measurements show that the
devices exhibit a gate-tunable supercurrent, multiple Andreev reflections, and
a good quality superconductor-semiconductor interface. The superconducting
characteristics of the Josephson junctions are investigated at different
magnetic fields and temperatures, and are analyzed based on the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The measurements of ac Josephson effect
are also conducted under microwave radiations with different radiation powers
and frequencies, and integer Shapiro steps are observed. Our work demonstrates
that InAs nanosheet based hybrid devices are desired systems for investigating
forefront physics, such as the two-dimensional topological superconductivity.

<br>
We report a study on the relationship between structure and electron
transport properties of nanoscale graphene/pentacene interfaces. We fabricated
graphene/pentacene interfaces from 10-30 nm thick needle-like pentacene
nanostructures down to two-three layers (2L-3L) dendritic pentacene islands,
and we measured their electron transport properties by conductive atomic force
microscopy (C-AFM). The energy barrier at the interfaces, i.e. the energy
position of the pentacene highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with
respect to the Fermi energy of the graphene and the C-AFM metal tip, are
determined and discussed with the appropriate electron transport model (double
Schottky diode model and Landauer-Buttiker model, respectively) taking into
account the voltage-dependent charge doping of graphene. In both types of
samples, the energy barrier at the graphene/pentacene interface is slightly
larger than that at the pentacene/metal tip interface, resulting in 0.47-0.55
eV and 0.21-0.34 eV, respectively, for the 10-30 nm thick needle-like pentacene
islands, and in 0.92-1.44 eV and 0.67-1.05 eV, respectively, for the 2L-3L
thick dendritic pentacene nanostructures. We attribute this difference to the
molecular organization details of the pentacene/graphene heterostructures, with
pentacene molecules lying flat on the graphene in the needle-like pentacene
nansotructures, while standing upright in 2L-3L dendritic islands, as observed
from Raman spectroscopy.

We examine the transmissions in gapped graphene through a combination of
double barriers tilting and time-oscillating potential. The latter introduces
extra sidebands to the transmission probability, which occur at energy levels
determined by the frequency and incident energy. The sidebands are generated as
a result of the absorption or emission of photons yielded from the oscillating
potential. Our results indicate that transmission probabilities in gapped
graphene can be manipulated by regulating the incident energy, the oscillating
potential, or the distance between two barriers and their heights. It has been
observed that the transmissions may be impeded or prevented by tuning the gap.

<h3>Conductance oscillations of antiferromagnetic layer tunnel junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the conductance oscillation of an antiferromagnetic layer tunnel
junction composed of antiferromagnetic topological insulators (MTIs) such as
MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. In presence of an in-plane magnetic field, we find that the
two terminal differential conductance across the junction oscillates as a
function of field strength. Notably, the quantum interference at weak fields
for the odd-layer MTIs is distinctive from the even-layer MTIs due to the
scattering phase difference. Consequently, the differential conductance is
vanishing (maximized) at integer magnetic flux quanta for even-layer
(odd-layer) junction. The conductance oscillations manifest the layer-dependent
quantum interference in which symmetries and scattering phases play essential
roles. In numerical calculations, we observe that the quantum interference
undergoes an evolution from SQUID-like patterns to Fraunhofer-like oscillations
as the junction length increases.

<h3>Corrections to the Bethe lattice solution of Anderson localization</h3>

<br>
<i>Matilde Baroni, Giulia Garcia Lorenzana, Tommaso Rizzo, Marco Tarzia</i>
<br>
<br>
We study numerically Anderson localization on lattices that are tree-like
except for the presence of one loop of varying length $L$. The resulting
expressions allow us to compute corrections to the Bethe lattice solution on i)
Random-Regular-Graph (RRG) of finite size $N$ and ii) euclidean lattices in
finite dimension. In the first case we show that the $1/N$ corrections to to
the average values of observables such as the typical density of states and the
inverse participation ratio have prefactors that diverge exponentially
approaching the critical point, which explains the puzzling observation that
the numerical simulations on finite RRGs deviate spectacularly from the
expected asymptotic behavior. In the second case our results, combined with the
$M$-layer expansion, predict that corrections destroy the exotic critical
behavior of the Bethe lattice solution in any finite dimension, strengthening
the suggestion that the upper critical dimension of Anderson localization is
infinity. This approach opens the way to the computation of non-mean-field
critical exponents by resumming the series of diverging diagrams through the
same recipes of the field-theoretical perturbative expansion.

We investigate bipartite particle number fluctuations near the rank-$2$
exceptional points (EPs) of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
models. Beyond a conformal field theory of massless fermions, fluctuations or
equivalently compressibility is negative definite and exhibits superinflation
in leading order at EPs, due to the defectiveness in the biorthogonal Hilbert
space. Associated with the bipartite von Neumann entanglement entropy, a
parameter in an anomalous correspondence referencing from a purely
non-Hermitian limit helps characterize two inequivalent EP sets. Our work paves
the way for understanding the singularity of fluctuations relevant to EPs, more
promisingly detectable in experiments.

<i>Natalia Chepiga</i>
<br>
<br>
We study critical properties of a Majorana chain in the presence of two
competing interactions of the shortest possible range. The obtained phase
diagram is very rich and contains nine different phases, including three
floating, two Ising, and four gapped phases. In addition we report a wide
variety of quantum phase transitions: the supersymmetric tri-critical Ising
lines; the Lifshitz critical line characterized by the dynamical critical
exponent $z=3$; Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions, and an exotic first order
transition between the floating and the gapped phases. However, the most
surprising feature of the obtained phase diagram is the emergence of the
commensurate line at which the floating phases collapses into direct
transition. We provide numerical evidences that the resulting multi-critical
point belongs to the universality class of the eight-vertex model. Implications
in the context of supersymmetric properties of the Majorana chain is briefly
discussed.

<br>
<i>Lenart Zadnik, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
<br>
With the aim to understand the role of the constraints in the thermalisation
of quantum systems, we study the dynamics of a family of kinetically
constrained models arising through duality from the XXZ spin chain. We find
that integrable and nonintegrable deformations around the stochastic point give
rise to ground state phase transitions between localised and delocalised
phases, which in turn determine the nature of the relaxation dynamics at finite
energy densities. While in the delocalised phase thermalisation is fast and
homogeneous, in the localised phase relaxation is slow, temporal
autocorrelations exhibit plateaus indicative of metastability, and the growth
of entanglement is heterogeneous in space. Furthermore, by considering
relaxation from initial product states, we demostrate that this slow
thermalisation can be rationalised directly from the presence of constraints in
the dynamics.

<h3>The quartic Blochnium: an anharmonic quasicharge superconducting qubit</h3>

<br>
<i>Luca Chirolli, Matteo Carrega, Francesco Giazotto</i>
<br>
<br>
The quasicharge superconducting qubit realizes the dual of the transmon and
shows strong robustness to flux and charge fluctuations thanks to a very large
inductance closed on a Josephson junction. At the same time, a weak
anharmonicity of the spectrum is inherited from the parent transmon, that
introduces leakage errors and is prone to frequency crowding in multi-qubit
setups. We propose a novel design that employs a quartic superinductor and
confers a good degree of anharmonicity to the spectrum. The quartic regime is
achieved through a properly designed chain of Josephson junction loops that
avoids strong quantum fluctuations without introducing a severe dependence on
the external flux.

Clock-spin models are attracting great interest, due to both their rich phase
diagram and their connection to parafermions. In this context, we derive an
exact local mapping from clock-spin to fermionic partition functions. Such
mapping, akin to techniques introduced by Fedotov and Popov for spin
$\frac{1}{2}$ chains, grants access to well established numerical tools for the
perturbative treatment of fermionic systems in the clock-spin framework.
Moreover, aside from the direct application in clock-spin models, this new
mapping enables the conception of interesting fermionic models, based on the
clock-spin counterparts.

<h3>Pattern formation by non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades</h3>

<br>
<br>
Fully developed turbulence is a universal and scale-invariant chaotic state
characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales where the cascade
is eventually arrested by dissipation. In this Letter, we show how to harness
these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns.
Conceptually, pattern or structure formation entails a process of wavelength
selection: patterns typically arise from the linear instability of a
homogeneous state. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully
non-linear and triggered by a non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades.
Instead of being dissipated, energy piles up at intermediate scales. Using a
combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable
wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns is set by a non-dissipative
transport coefficient called odd or gyro viscosity. This non-dissipative
viscosity is ubiquitous in chiral systems ranging from plasmas, bio-active
media and quantum fluids. Beyond chiral fluids, cascade-induced pattern
formation could occur in natural systems including oceanic and atmospheric
flows, planetary and stellar plasma such as the solar wind, as well as in
industrial processes such as the pulverization of objects into debris or in
chemistry and biology where the coagulation of droplets can be interrupted at a
tunable scale.

In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that a strong enhancement of the
Magnetocaloric Effect is achieved in geometrically frustrated cluster
spin-glass systems just above the freezing temperature. We consider a network
of clusters interacting randomly which have triangular structure composed of
Ising spins interacting antiferromagnetically. The intercluster disorder
problem is treated using a cluster spin glass mean-field theory, which allows
exact solution of the disordered problem. The intracluster part can be solved
using exact enumeration. The coupling between the inter and intracluster
problem incorporates the interplay between effects coming from geometric
frustration and disorder. As a result, it is shown that there is the onset of
cluster spin glass phase even with very weak disorder. Remarkably, it is
exactly within a range of very weak disorder and small magnetic field that is
observed the strongest isothermal release of entropy.

The propensity of water to remain in a metastable liquid state at
temperatures below its equilibrium melting point holds significant potential
for cryopreserving biological material such as tissues and organs. The benefits
conferred are a direct result of progressively reducing metabolic expenditure
due to colder temperatures while simultaneously avoiding the irreversible
damage caused by the crystallization of ice. Unfortunately, the freezing of
water in bulk systems of clinical relevance is dominated by random
heterogeneous nucleation initiated by uncharacterized trace impurities, and the
marked unpredictability of this behavior has prevented implementation of
supercooling outside of controlled laboratory settings and in volumes larger
than a few milliliters. Here, we develop a statistical model that jointly
captures both the inherent stochastic nature of nucleation using conventional
Poisson statistics as well as the random variability of heterogeneous
nucleation catalysis through bivariate extreme value statistics. Individually,
these two classes of models cannot account for both the time-dependent nature
of nucleation and the sample-to-sample variability associated with
heterogeneous catalysis, and traditional extreme value models have only
considered variation of the characteristic nucleation temperature. We conduct a
series of constant cooling rate and isothermal nucleation experiments with
physiological saline solutions and leverage the statistical model to evaluate
the natural variability of kinetic and thermodynamic nucleation parameters. By
quantifying freezing probability as a function of temperature, supercooled
duration, and system volume, while accounting for nucleation site variability,
this study also provides a basis for the rational design of stable supercooled
biopreservation protocols.

Photocurrent acts as one of measurable responses of material to light, which
has proved itself to be crucial for sensing and energy harvesting. Topological
semimetals with gapless energy dispersion and abundant topological surface and
bulk states exhibit exotic photocurrent responses, such as novel quantized
circular photogalvanic effect observed in Weyl semimetals. Here we find that
for a topological nodal-line semimetal (NLSM) with nodal ring bulk states and
drumhead surface states (DSS), a significant photocurrent can be produced by an
electromagnetic (EM) wave by means of the quantum Hall effect. The Hall current
is enabled by electron transfer between Landau levels (LLs) and triggered by
both the electric field and magnetic field components of an EM wave. This Hall
current is physically connected to an unusually large quantum-Hall conductivity
of the zeroth LLs resulting from quantized DSS. These LLs are found to be
highly degenerate due to the unique band-folding effect associated with
magnetic-field-induced expansion of a unit cell. Furthermore, we observe that
the Hall current induced solely by an in-plane linearly-polarized EM wave
becomes a quantized entity which allows for possible direct measurement of the
DSS density in a topological NLSM. This work paves a way toward designing
high-magnetic-field-sensitivity detection devices for industrial and space
applications, such as the development of self-detection of
current-surge-induced overheating in electronic devices and accurate Earth's
magnetic-anomaly maps for guiding a self-navigating drone or an aircraft.

The frictionless, directional propagation of particles at the boundary of
topological materials is one of the most striking phenomena in transport. These
chiral edge modes lie at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall
effects, and their extraordinary robustness against noise and disorder reflects
the quantization of Hall conductivity in these systems. Despite their central
importance, controllable injection of edge modes, and direct imaging of their
propagation, structure, and dynamics, is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the
distillation of individual chiral edge states in a rapidly-rotating bosonic
superfluid confined by an optical boundary. Tuning the wall sharpness, we
reveal the smooth crossover between soft wall behaviour in which the
propagation speed is proportional to wall steepness, and the hard wall regime
exhibiting chiral free particles. From the skipping motion of atoms along the
boundary, we spectroscopically infer the energy gap between the ground and
first excited edge bands, and reveal its evolution from the bulk Landau level
splitting for a soft boundary, to the hard wall limit.

We consider non-dissipative drag between Bose-condensed exciton polaritons in
optical microcavity and embedded superconductors. This effect consists in
induction of a non-dissipative electric current in the superconductor by motion
of polariton Bose condensate due to electron-polariton interaction, or vice
versa. Using many-body theory, we calculate the drag density, characterizing
magnitude of this effect, with taking into account dynamical screening of the
interaction. Hoping to diminish the interaction screening and microcavity
photon absorption, we consider atomically-thin superconductors (both
conventional s-wave and copper-oxide d-wave) of planar and nanoribbon shapes.
Our estimates show that in realistic conditions the drag effect could be rather
weak but observable in accurate experiments in the case of dipolar interlayer
excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers. Use of spatially direct
excitons, semiconductor quantum wells as the host for excitons, or thin films
of bulk metallic superconductors considerably lowers the drag density.

A recently developed full field level-set model of continuous dynamic
recrystallization is applied to simulate zircaloy-4 recrystallization during
hot compression and subsequent heat treatment. The influence of strain rate,
final strain and initial microstructure is investigated, by experimental and
simulation tools. The recrystallization heterogeneity is quantified. This
enables to confirm that quenched microstructures display a higher extent of
heterogeneity. The simulation results replicate satisfactorily experimental
observations. The simulation framework is especially able to capture such
recrystallization heterogeneity induced by a different initial microstructure.
Finally, the role of intragranular dislocation density heterogeneities over the
preferential growth of recrystallized grains is pointed out thanks to
additional simulations with different numerical formulations.

The state-of-the-art in paper mechanics calls for novel experimental data
covering the full-field hygro-expansion of inter-fiber bonds in paper, i.e.,
the 3D morphological changes and inter-fiber interactions. Therefore, a
recently developed full-field single fiber hygro-expansion measurement
methodology based on global digital height correlation is extended to
orthogonally bonded inter-fiber bonds, to investigate their full-field quasi-3D
hygroscopic behavior. A sample holder has been developed which enables the
quasi-3D characterization of the initial geometry of individual inter-fiber
bonds, including the fiber thickness and width along the length of the fibers
as well as the degree of wrap around and contact area of the bond, which are
vital for understanding the inter-fiber bond hygro-mechanics. Full-field
hygroscopic testing revealed novel insights on the inter-fiber interactions:
(i) the transverse hygro-expansion of each fiber strongly reduces when
approaching the bonded area, due to the significantly lower longitudinal
hygro-expansion of the other bonded fiber. (ii) The relatively large transverse
strain of one fiber stretches the other crossing fiber in its longitudinal
direction, thereby significantly contributing to the sheet scale
hygro-expansion. (iii) Out-of-plane bending is observed in the bonded region
which is driven by the significant difference in transverse and longitudinal
hygro-expansion of, respectively, the top and bottom fiber constituting the
bond. A bi-layer laminate model is derived to rationalize the bending
deformation and an adequate match is found with the experimental data. Under
the assumption of zero bending, which represents constrained inter-fiber bonds
inside a paper sheet, the model is able to predict the contribution of the
transverse strain in the bonded regions to the sheet-scale hygro-expansion.

<h3>The Whitham approach to Generalized Hydrodynamics</h3>

The formation of dispersive shock waves in the one-dimensional Bose gas
represents a limitation of Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD) due to the
coarse-grained nature of the theory. Nevertheless, GHD accurately captures the
long wavelength behavior indicating an implicit knowledge of the underlying
microscopic physics. Such representation are already known through the Whitham
modulation theory, where dispersion-less equations describe the slow modulation
of the shock wave parameters, yet allowing the reconstruction of the
microscopic solution. Here we investigate the correspondence between
Generalized Hydrodynamics and Whithams approach in the weakly interacting
regime. Our findings enable us to accurately recover the dispersive shock wave
directly from the GHD solution in agreement with simulations of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Furthermore, our results lends themselves to
additional physical interpretation regarding the formation of shock waves.
