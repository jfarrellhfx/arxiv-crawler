<h3>Microscopy is All You Need</h3>

<br>

We pose that microscopy offers an ideal real-world experimental environment
for the development and deployment of active Bayesian and reinforcement
learning methods. Indeed, the tremendous progress achieved by machine learning
(ML) and artificial intelligence over the last decade has been largely achieved
via the utilization of static data sets, from the paradigmatic MNIST to the
bespoke corpora of text and image data used to train large models such as GPT3,
DALLE and others. However, it is now recognized that continuous, minute
improvements to state-of-the-art do not necessarily translate to advances in
real-world applications. We argue that a promising pathway for the development
of ML methods is via the route of domain-specific deployable algorithms in
areas such as electron and scanning probe microscopy and chemical imaging. This
will benefit both fundamental physical studies and serve as a test bed for more
complex autonomous systems such as robotics and manufacturing. Favorable
environment characteristics of scanning and electron microscopy include low
risk, extensive availability of domain-specific priors and rewards, relatively
small effects of exogeneous variables, and often the presence of both upstream
first principles as well as downstream learnable physical models for both
statics and dynamics. Recent developments in programmable interfaces, edge
computing, and access to APIs facilitating microscope control, all render the
deployment of ML codes on operational microscopes straightforward. We discuss
these considerations and hope that these arguments will lead to creating a
novel set of development targets for the ML community by accelerating both
real-world ML applications and scientific progress.

<h3>Electron-mediated entanglement of two distant macroscopic ferromagnets  within a nonequilibrium spintronic device</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06634" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06634</a>

<br>
Using the nascent concept of quantum spin-transfer torque [A. Zholud et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 119}, 257201 (2017); M. D. Petrovi\'{c} et al., Phys.
Rev. X {\bf 11}, 021062 (2021)], we predict that a charge current pulse can be
harnessed to entangle localized quantum spins of two spatially separated
ferromagnets (FMs) within a FM$_p$/NM/FM$_a$ spin-valve spintronic device,
where a normal metal (NM) spacer separates a spin-polarizer (FM$_p$) from a
spin-analyzer (FM$_a$) FM layer. The injection of a current pulse endows the
spin-valve system with rich nonequilibrium dynamics, where a quantum
superposition of many-body states places the spatially separated FM layers into
a mixed entangled state, after tracing out the degrees of freedom of the
conduction electrons. This is due to a transfer of spin angular momentum from
conduction electrons to the localized spins via a quantum spin-transfer torque
mechanism that remains active even for {\em collinear but antiparallel}
arrangements of the FM$_p$ and FM$_a$ magnetizations, a situation in which the
conventional spin-torque is absent. The dynamical build-up of mixed-state
entanglement between the FM layers is quantified by calculating the mutual
logarithmic negativity, entanglement entropy and mutual information over time
via fully quantum many-body approaches. The effect of decoherence on our
scheme, the use of multi-electron pulses and the scaling with system size are
also analyzed in an effort to ascertain the robustness of our predictions under
realistic experimental conditions. Finally, we propose a
``current-pump/X-ray-probe'' scheme, utilizing ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy,
which can witness nonequilibrium entanglement of the FM layers by extracting
their time-dependent quantum Fisher information.

<h3>Coalescing Clusters Unveil New Regimes of Frictional Fluid Mechanics</h3>

Droplet coalescence is essential in a host of biological and industrial
processes, involving complex systems as diverse as cellular aggregates,
colloidal suspensions, and polymeric liquids. Classical solutions for the time
evolution of coalescing clusters are typically based on tractable limiting
physics, such as analytical solutions to the Stokes equation. By combining
computational and theoretical analyses, we show that there is an unexplored
family of coalescence processes: those governed by highly dissipative coupling
to the environment. This leads to new scaling laws characterizing droplet
coalescence, as well as new time-invariant parameterizations of the shape
evolution of the coalescing system. We demonstrate these effects via
particle-based simulations and both continuum and boundary-integral solutions
to hydrodynamic equations, which we then understand in the context of a
generalized Navier-Stokes-like equation. Our theoretical description of highly
frictional coalescence mathematically maps onto Darcy flow in the presence of
surface tension effects, opening up exciting avenues of research in applying
well-studied fluid dynamical techniques to a broad range of novel systems.

<h3>A robust and tunable Luttinger liquid in correlated edge of  transition-metal second-order topological insulator Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</h3>

<br>
The interplay between topology and interaction always plays an important role
in condense matter physics and induces many exotic quantum phases, while rare
transition metal layered material (TMLM) has been proved to possess both. Here
we report a TMLM Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ has the two-dimensional second-order
topology (also a topological quadrupole insulator) with correlated edge states
- Luttinger liquid. It is ascribed to the unconventional nature of the mismatch
between charge- and atomic- centers induced by a remarkable double-band
inversion. This one-dimensional protected edge state preserves the Luttinger
liquid behavior with robustness and universality in scale from micro- to macro-
size, leading to a huge anisotropic electrical transport through
two-dimensional sides of bulk materials. Moreover, the bulk gap can be
modulated by the thickness, resulting in an extensive-range phase diagram for
Luttinger liquid. These provide an attractive model to study the interaction
and quantum phases in correlated topological systems.

<h3>Open-system spin transport and operator weight dissipation in spin  chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06494" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06494</a>
<br>
<i>Yongchan Yoo, Christopher David White, Brian Swingle</i>
<br>
We use non-equilibrium steady states to study the effect of
dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) on the scaling behavior of
transport in one-dimensional spin chains. We consider three models in the XXZ
family: the XXZ model with staggered anisotropy, which is chaotic; XXZ model
with no external field and tunable interaction, which is Bethe ansatz
integrable and (in the zero interaction limit) free fermion integrable; and the
disordered XY model, which is free-fermion integrable and Anderson localized.
We find evidence that DAOE's effect on transport is controlled by its effect on
the system's conserved quantities. To the extent that DAOE preserves those
symmetries, it preserves the scaling of the system's transport properties; to
the extent it breaks those conserved quantities, it pushes the system towards
diffusive scaling of transport.

<h3>Reemergence of missing Shapiro steps in the presence of in-plane  magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06502" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06502</a>
<br>
<i>Bassel Heiba Elfeky, Joseph J. Cuozzo, Neda Lotfizadeh, William F. Schiela, William M. Strickland, Dylan Langone, Enrico Rossi, Javad Shabani</i>
<br>
In the presence of a 4$\pi$-periodic contribution to the current phase
relation, for example in topological Josephson junctions, odd Shapiro steps are
expected to be missing. While missing odd Shapiro steps have been observed in
several material systems and interpreted in the context of topological
superconductivity, they have also been observed in topologically trivial
junctions. Here, we study the evolution of such trivial missing odd Shapiro
steps in Al-InAs junctions in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field
$B^{\theta}$. We find that the odd steps reappear at a crossover $B^{\theta}$
value, exhibiting an in-plane field angle anisotropy that depends on spin-orbit
coupling effects. We interpret this behavior by theoretically analyzing the
Andreev bound state spectrum and the transitions induced by the non-adiabatic
dynamics of the junction. Our results highlight the complex phenomenology of
missing Shapiro steps and the underlying current phase relations in planar
Josephson junctions designed to realize Majorana states.

<h3>Local spectroscopy of gate-switchable Chern insulating states in twisted  monolayer-bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06506</a>
<br>
<i>Canxun Zhang, Tiancong Zhu, Tomohiro Soejima, Salman Kahn, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Alex Zettl, Feng Wang, Michael P. Zaletel, Michael F. Crommie</i>
<br>
Twisting and stacking atomically-thin materials provides a versatile platform
for investigating emergent quantum phases of matter driven by strong
correlation and non-trivial topology. Novel phenomena such as correlated
insulating states, unconventional superconductivity, and the quantum anomalous
Hall effect have been observed in several twisted moir\'e systems, but fully
understanding the underlying microscopic mechanisms remains challenging.
Measurements performed on different samples of the same twisted system often
exhibit different low-temperature phase diagrams, suggesting that the ground
states of these materials could be susceptible to local structural
inhomogeneity that is difficult to capture through macroscopic probes. We have
used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to demonstrate the
interplay between correlation, topology, and local structural parameters in
determining the behavior of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene. We observe
local spectroscopic signatures for correlated insulating states having total
Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot} = \pm 2$ at 3/4-filling of the conduction moir\'e
mini-band and have characterized their evolution in an out-of-plane magnetic
field. We have determined the relationship between topological behavior and
local twist angle accompanied by hetero-strain, and show that the sign of
$C_\mathrm{tot}$ can be controlled via electrostatic gating over a limited
range of twist angles under small strain but not as the strain grows larger.
The electrical control of Chern number results from a competition between the
orbital magnetizations of filled bulk bands and chiral edge states that is
sensitive to strain-induced distortion in the moir\'e superlattice.

<h3>Superconductivity from a melted insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06508" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06508</a>
<br>
<i>S. Mukhopadhyay, J. Senior, J. Saez-Mollejo, D. Puglia, M. Zemlicka, J. Fink, A.P. Higginbotham</i>
<br>
Quantum phase transitions typically result in a broadened critical or
crossover region at nonzero temperature. Josephson arrays are a model of this
phenomenon, exhibiting a superconductor-insulator transition at a critical wave
impedance, and a well-understood insulating phase. Yet high-impedance arrays
used in quantum computing and metrology apparently evade this transition,
displaying superconducting behavior deep into the nominally insulating regime.
The absence of critical behavior in such devices is not well understood. Here
we show that, unlike the typical quantum-critical broadening scenario, in
Josephson arrays temperature dramatically shifts the critical region. This
shift leads to a regime of superconductivity at high temperature, arising from
the melted zero-temperature insulator. Our results quantitatively explain the
low-temperature onset of superconductivity in nominally insulating regimes, and
the transition to the strongly insulating phase. We further present, to our
knowledge, the first understanding of the onset of anomalous-metallic
resistance saturation. This work demonstrates a non-trivial interplay between
thermal effects and quantum criticality. A practical consequence is that,
counterintuitively, the coherence of high-impedance quantum circuits is
expected to be stabilized by thermal fluctuations.

<h3>Microscopic nature of the charge-density wave in kagome superconductor  RbV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonathan Frassineti, Pietro Bonfà, Giuseppe Allodi, Erick Garcia, Rong Cong, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Roberto De Renzi, Vesna F. Mitrović, Samuele Sanna</i>
<br>
The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb,
Cs) offer the possibility to study the interplay between competing electronic
orderings, such as charge density order and superconductivity. We focus on the
former and provide a comprehensive set of $^{51}$V, $^{87}$Rb, and $^{121}$Sb
magnetic resonance measurements on an RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystal. Elucidating
the symmetries and properties of the CDW phase is essential to understanding
the unconventional electronic orderings occurring in this material. We
establish the structure of the $2\times 2 \times 2$ superlattice that describes
the system below the charge density wave transition by combining both
experimental and computational methods, with a methodology that can be readily
applied to the remaining compounds of the same family. Our results give
compelling evidence that the CDW structure occurring below 103 K for
RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is the so-called Inverse Start of David pattern $\pi$-shifted
along the c axis (also known as staggered tri-hexagonal).

<h3>Beyond Single Tetrahedron Physics of Breathing Pyrochlore Compound  Ba3Yb2Zn5O11</h3>

<br>
Recently a new class of quantum magnets, the so-called breathing pyrochlore
spin systems, have attracted much attention due to their potential to host
exotic emergent phenomena. Here, we present magnetometry, heat capacity,
thermal conductivity, Muon-spin relaxation, and polarized inelastic neutron
scattering measurements performed on high-quality single-crystal samples of
breathing pyrochlore compound Ba3Yb2Zn5O11. We interpret these results using a
simplified toy model and provide a new insight into the low-energy physics of
this system beyond the single-tetrahedron physics proposed previously.

<h3>Kondo enabled transmutation between spinons and superconducting  vortices: origin of magnetic memory in 4Hb-$\mathrm{TaS_2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06550" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06550</a>
<br>
<i>Shi-Zeng Lin</i>
<br>
Recent experiments [Persky {\it{et al.}}, Nature {\bf{607}}, 692 (2022)]
demonstrate a magnetic memory effect in 4Hb-$\mathrm{TaS_2}$ above its
superconducting transition temperature, where Abriokosov vortices are generated
spontaneously by lowering temperature at zero magnetic field after field
training the normal state. Motivated by the experiment, we propose the chiral
quantum spin liquid (QSL) stabilized in the constituent layers of
4Hb-$\mathrm{TaS_2}$ as a mechanism. We model 4Hb-$\mathrm{TaS_2}$ as coupled
layers of the chiral QSL and superconductor. Through the Kondo coupling between
the localized moments and conduction electrons, there is mutual transmutation
between spinons and vortices during the thermal cycling process, which yields
magnetic memory effect as observed in experiments. We also propose a mechanism
to stabilize the chiral and nematic superconductivity in 4Hb-$\mathrm{TaS_2}$
through the Kondo coupling of conduction electrons to the chiral QSL. Our
results suggest 4Hb-$\mathrm{TaS_2}$ as an exciting platform to explore the
interplay between QSL and superconductivity through the Kondo effect.

<h3>Critical role of magnetic moments on lattice dynamics in  YBa${}_{2}$Cu${}_{3}$O${}_{6}$</h3>

<br>
<i>Jinliang Ning, Christopher Lane, Yubo Zhang, Matthew Matzelle, ahadur Singh, Bernardo Barbiellini, Robert S. Markiewicz, Arun Bansil, Jianwei Sun</i>
<br>
The role of lattice dynamics in unconventional high-temperature
superconductivity is still vigorously debated. Theoretical insights into this
problem have long been prevented by the absence of an accurate first-principles
description of the combined electronic, magnetic, and lattice degrees of
freedom. Utilizing the recently constructed r$^2$SCAN density functional that
stabilizes the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state of the pristine oxide
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_6$, we faithfully reproduce the experimental dispersion of key
phonon modes. We further find significant magnetoelastic coupling in numerous
high energy Cu-O bond stretching optical branches, where the AFM results
improve over the soft non-magnetic phonon bands.

<h3>Stability of the Néel quantum critical point in the presence of Dirac  fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06577" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06577</a>
<br>
<i>Huanzhi Hu, Jennifer Lin, Mikolaj D. Uryszek, Frank Krüger</i>
<br>
We investigate the stability of the N\'eel quantum critical point of a
non-linear $\sigma$ model (NL$\sigma$M) in two spatial dimensions in the
presence of a Yukawa coupling to $N_f$ flavours of two-component Dirac fermion
fields. This field theory could for example describe the magnetic ordering
transition of a quantum antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice with Kondo
coupling between spins and conduction electrons at half filling. In this case,
the two-fold spin and valley degeneracies result in $N_f=4$. The
long-wavelength order parameter fluctuations are subject to Landau damping by
electronic particle-hole fluctuations.As a first step, we set the Yukawa
coupling to zero and investigate the criticality of the Landau damped
NL$\sigma$M. Using momentum-shell RG, we demonstrate that the Landau damping is
weakly irrelevant at the N\'eel quantum critical point, despite the fact that
the corresponding self-energy correction dominates over the quadratic gradient
terms in the IR limit. In the ordered phase, the Landau damping increases under
the RG, indicative of damped spin-wave excitations. We then analyze the coupled
RG flow of Landau damping and Yukawa coupling on the critical surface. Although
the Yukawa coupling is weakly relevant, sufficiently strong Landau damping
renders the N\'eel quantum critical point quasi-stable for $N_f\ge 4$ and
thermodynamically stable for $N_f<4$. In the latter case, we identify a new
multi-critical point which describes the transition between the N\'eel critical
and Kondo run-away regimes. The symmetry breaking at this fixed point results
in the opening of a gap in the Dirac fermion spectrum. Approaching the
multi-critical point from the disordered phase, the fermionic quasiparticle
residue vanishes, giving rise to non-Fermi-liquid behavior.

<h3>Observation of Vector Spin Seebeck Effect in a Noncollinear  Antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
Spintronic phenomena to date have been established in magnets with collinear
moments, where the spin injection through the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is
always along the out-of-plane direction. Here, we report the observation of a
vector SSE in a noncollinear antiferromagnet (AF) LuFeO$_3$, where temperature
gradient along the out-of-plane and also the in-plane directions can both
inject a pure spin current and generate a voltage in the heavy metal via the
inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). We show that the thermovoltages are due to the
magnetization from canted spins in LuFeO$_3$. Furthermore, in contrast to the
challenges of generating, manipulating and detecting spin current in collinear
AFs, the vector SSE in LuFeO$_3$ is readily viable in zero magnetic field and
can be controlled by a small magnetic field of about 150 Oe at room
temperature. The noncollinear AFs expand new realms for exploring spin
phenomena and provide a new route to low-field antiferromagnetic spin
caloritronics and magnonics.

<br>
The detection of the magnon Hall effect (MHE) has relied solely on the
challenging measurement of the thermal Hall conductivity. Here, we report the
electrical detection of MHE with high sensitivity in Lu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$/heavy
metal heterostructures, highly desirable for the exploration of new materials
with MHE and their applications. Using wires with different Seebeck
coefficients, we can identify and separate MHE from other spin caloritronic
effects of anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) and spin Seebeck effect (SSE), crucial
for distinguishing different constituents in spin caloritronic phenomena. We
have found that a thick heavy metal overlayer can eliminate the signals from
ANE and SSE, and that the MHE is robust with respect to the different deposited
heavy metals. The MHE in Lu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$ is isotropic among crystals with
different orientations. In addition to previously realized transverse MHE, we
have also uncovered longitudinal MHE, where the temperature gradient has been
applied in the in-plane and the out-of-plane directions, respectively.

<h3>When does deep learning fail and how to tackle it? A critical analysis  on polymer sequence-property surrogate models</h3>

<i>Himanshu, Tarak K Patra</i>
<br>
Deep learning models are gaining popularity and potency in predicting polymer
properties. These models can be built using pre-existing data and are useful
for the rapid prediction of polymer properties. However, the performance of a
deep learning model is intricately connected to its topology and the volume of
training data. There is no facile protocol available to select a deep learning
architecture, and there is a lack of a large volume of homogeneous
sequence-property data of polymers. These two factors are the primary
bottleneck for the efficient development of deep learning models. Here we
assess the severity of these factors and propose new algorithms to address
them. We show that a linear layer-by-layer expansion of a neural network can
help in identifying the best neural network topology for a given problem.
Moreover, we map the discrete sequence space of a polymer to a continuous
one-dimensional latent space using a machine learning pipeline to identify
minimal data points for building a universal deep learning model. We implement
these approaches for three representative cases of building sequence-property
surrogate models, viz., the single-molecule radius of gyration of a copolymer,
adhesive free energy of a copolymer, and copolymer compatibilizer,
demonstrating the generality of the proposed strategies. This work establishes
efficient methods for building universal deep learning models with minimal data
and hyperparameters for predicting sequence-defined properties of polymers.

<h3>Molecular mechanism of the Debye relaxation in monohydroxy alcohols  revealed from rheo-dielectric spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06623</a>
<br>
<i>Shalin Patil, Ruikun Sun, Shinian Cheng, Shiwang Cheng</i>
<br>
Rheodielectric spectroscopy is employed, for the first time, to investigate
the effect of external shear on the Debyelike relaxation of a model monohydroxy
alcohol, i.e., the 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2E1H). Shear deformation leads to strong
acceleration in the structural relaxation, the Debye relaxation, and the
terminal relaxation of 2E1H. Moreover, the shear-induced reduction in
structural relaxation time, tau_alpha, scales quadratically with that of Debye
time, tau_D, and the terminal flow time, tau_f, suggesting a relationship of
tau_D*tau_D~tau_alpha. Further analyses reveal tau_D*tau_D/tau_alpha of 2E1H
follows Arrhenius temperature dependence that applies remarkably well to many
other monohydroxy alcohols with different molecular sizes, architectures, and
alcohol types. These results cannot be understood by the prevailing transient
chain model and suggest a H-bonding breakage facilitated sub-supramolecular
reorientation as the origin of Debye relaxation of monohydroxy alcohols, akin
to the molecular mechanism for the terminal relaxation of unentangled living
polymers

<h3>Dynamical Effects from Anomaly: Modified Electrodynamics in Weyl  Semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06641</a>
<br>
<i>Xuzhe Ying, A. A. Burkov, Chong Wang</i>
<br>
We discuss the modified quantum electrodynamics from a time-reversal-breaking
Weyl semimetal coupled with a $U(1)$ gauge (electromagnetic) field. A key role
is played by the soft dispersion of the photons in a particular direction, say
$\hat{z}$, due to the Hall conductivity of the Weyl semimetal. Due to the soft
photon, the fermion velocity in $\hat{z}$ is logarithmically reduced under
renormalization group flow, together with the fine structure constant.
Meanwhile, fermions acquire a finite lifetime from spontaneous emission of the
soft photon, namely the Cherenkov radiation. At low energy $E$, the inverse of
the fermion lifetime scales as $\tau^{-1}\sim E/{\rm PolyLog}(E)$. Therefore,
even though fermion quasiparticles are eventually well-defined at very low
energy, over a wide intermediate energy window the Weyl semimetal behaves like
a marginal Fermi liquid. Phenomenologically, our results are more relevant for
emergent Weyl semimetals, where the fermions and photons all emerge from
strongly correlated lattice systems. Possible experimental implications are
discussed.

<h3>Intertwined magnetism and charge density wave order in kagome FeGe</h3>

<br>
Electron correlations often lead to emergent orders in quantum materials.
Kagome lattice materials are emerging as an exciting platform for realizing
quantum topology in the presence of electron correlations. This proposal stems
from the key signatures of electronic structures associated with its lattice
geometry: flat band induced by destructive interference of the electronic
wavefunctions, topological Dirac crossing, and a pair of van Hove singularities
(vHSs). A plethora of correlated electronic phases have been discovered amongst
kagome lattice materials, including magnetism, charge density wave (CDW),
nematicity, and superconductivity. These materials can be largely organized
into two types: those that host magnetism and those that host CDW order.
Recently, a CDW order has been discovered in the magnetic kagome FeGe,
providing a new platform for understanding the interplay between CDW and
magnetism. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
observe all three types of electronic signatures of the kagome lattice: flat
bands, Dirac crossings, and vHSs. From both the observation of a
temperature-dependent shift of the vHSs towards the Fermi level as well as
guidance via first-principle calculations, we identify the presence of the vHSs
near the Fermi level (EF) to be driven by the development of underlying
magnetic exchange splitting. Furthermore, we show spectral evidence for the CDW
order as gaps that open on the near-EF vHS bands, as well as evidence of
electron-phonon coupling from a kink on the vHS band together with phonon
hardening observed by inelastic neutron scattering. Our observation points to
the magnetic interaction-driven band modification resulting in the formation of
the CDW order, indicating an intertwined connection between the emergent
magnetism and vHS charge order in this moderately-correlated kagome metal.

<h3>Further On the Fountain Effect in Superfluid Helium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06666" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06666</a>
<br>
<i>Phil Attard</i>
<br>
In the previous paper (Attard 2022d)on the fountain pressure in superfluid
helium, it was shown that the experimentally confirmed expression of H. London
(1939) was thermodynamically equivalent to equality of chemical potential.
However this theoretical equivalence was not reflected in the experimental
data. The problem has now been traced to errors in the enthalpy and entropy
derived from the measured heat capacity by Donnelly and Barenghi (1998). In
this paper the corrected thermodynamic data yields almost exact agreement
between the two expressions and the measured fountain pressure. A physical
explanation is given for energy minimization as the principle that drives the
fountain effect and superfluid flow more generally.

<h3>Hartree-Fock with Nambu spinors, and d-wave condensation in the 2D  Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06674" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06674</a>
<br>
<i>Kazue Matsuyama, Jeff Greensite</i>
<br>
The usual Hartree-Fock approximation to the Hubbard model is based on
eigenstates of the electron number operator. But this formulation is not
unique. A different (and inequivalent) version, formulated in terms of Nambu
two-component spinors, is based on eigenstates of the difference between the
numbers of spin up and spin down electrons, with electron density dependent on
parameters $U,t,t'$ and chemical potential $\mu$. The advantage of this
formulation is that electron pairing condensates can be directly computed. We
show that in the low-lying states near half-filling, obtained in this ``Nambu''
Hartree-Fock approximation, a discrete rotation symmetry is spontaneously
broken, and the condensates exhibit the expected d-wave form in momentum space.
A form closely reminiscent of d-wave symmetry can be demonstrated analytically
already at $U=0$, from straightforward degenerate perturbation theory. We find
that the Nambu and standard Hartree-Fock ground states are exactly degenerate
in energy at $U=0$ and half-filling. Which of these two states are lower in
energy at $U > 0$ depends on $U$ and $t'$ and electron density, and there is a
large parameter range, with $t' > 0$ below half-filling, where the Nambu
Hartree-Fock state, and corresponding d-wave condensation, is energetically
preferred.

<br>
We report the electrochemical investigation of 5% Al doped MoS$_2$@rGO
composite as a high-performance anode for sodium (Na)-ion batteries. The x-ray
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy characterizations reveal that the Al doping increase the interlayer
spacing of (002) plane of MoS$_2$ nanosheets and form a stable 1T phase. The
galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements show the specific capacity stable
around 450, 400, 350, 300 and 200 mAhg$^{-1}$ at current densities of 0.05,
0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1~Ag$^{-1}$, respectively. Also, we observe the capacity
retentions of 86% and 66% at 0.1 and 0.3 Ag$^{-1}$, respectively, over 200
cycles with a consistent Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. The cyclic
voltammetry, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to find the kinetic behavior
and the obtained value of diffusion coefficient falls in the range of
10$^{-10}$ to 10$^{-12}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$. Intriguingly, the in-situ EIS also
explains the electrochemical kinetics of the electrode at different
charge-discharge states with the variation of charge transfer resistance.
Moreover, the post cycling investigation using ex-situ XRD and photoemission
spectroscopy indicate the coexistence of 1T/2H phase and field-emission
scanning electron microscopy confirm the stable morphology after 500 cycles.
Also, the Na-ion transport properties are calculated for 1T Al--MoS$_2$@rGO
interface and Al--MoS$_2$--MoS$_2$ interlayer host structure by theoretical
calculations using density functional theory.

<h3>Exploring unconventional quantum criticality in the p-wave-paired  Aubry-André-Harper model</h3>

<i>Ting Lv, Yu-Bin Liu, Tian-Cheng Yi, Liangsheng Li, Maoxin Liu, Wen-Long You</i>
<br>
We have investigated scaling properties near the quantum critical point
between the extended phase and the critical phase in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper
model with p-wave pairing, which have rarely been exploited as most
investigations focus on the localization transition from the critical phase to
the localized phase. We find that the spectrum averaged entanglement entropy
and the generalized fidelity susceptibility act as eminent universal order
parameters of the corresponding critical point without gap closing. We
introduce a Widom scaling ansatz for these criticality probes to develop a
unified theory of critical exponents and scaling functions. We thus extract the
correlation-length critical exponent $\nu$ and the dynamical exponent $z$
through the finite-size scaling given the system sizes increase in the
Fibonacci sequence. The retrieved values of $\nu \simeq 1.000$ and $z \simeq
3.610$ indicate that the transition from the extended phase to the critical
phase belongs to a different universality class from the localization
transition. Our approach sets the stage for exploring the unconventional
quantum criticality and the associated universal information of quasiperiodic
systems in state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments.

<br>
Creating molecules with tailored functionality requires understanding the
intricate interplay between structure and interactions at the sub-molecular
level. Here, we emulate the structure and orbital landscape of planar organic
molecules using solely individual cesium ions atomically positioned on the
surface of semiconducting indium antimonide. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy, combined with ab initio calculations, we show that
an artificial atom can be derived from localized states created from a
patterned cesium ring. The resultant nearly radially symmetric potential can
then be used to couple artificial atoms, leading to bonding and antibonding
orbitals as well as to different orbital symmetries. Based on these artificial
orbitals, we emulate well-known organic molecules based on various constructed
atomic structures, including anti-aromatic molecules, and characterize the
resultant emulated molecular orbitals. This platform can be used to emulate
molecular structures as well as monitor the interplay between structure and the
orbital landscape with sub-molecular precision.

<h3>Quantum anomalous Hall effects controlled by chiral domain walls</h3>

<br>
<i>Qirui Cui, Jinghua Liang, Yingmei Zhu, Xiong Yao, Hongxin Yang</i>
<br>
We report the interplay between two different topological phases in condensed
matter physics, the magnetic chiral domain wall (DW), and the quantum anomalous
Hall (QAH) effect. We show that the chiral DW driven by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) can divide the uniform domain into several zones where the
neighboring zone possesses opposite quantized Hall conductance. The separated
domain with a chiral edge state (CES) can be continuously modified by external
magnetic field-induced domain expansion and thermal fluctuation, which gives
rise to the reconfigurable QAH effect. More interestingly, we show that the
position of CES can be tuned by spin current-driven chiral DW motion. Several
two-dimensional magnets with high Curie temperatures and large topological band
gaps are proposed for realizing these phenomena. Our work thus reveals the
possibility of chiral DW controllable QAH effects.

<br>
A second order cross-linked network is applied onto the classical Husimi
lattice, to investigate the role of a "phantom" non-neighboring interactions of
mid- and long-range in Bethe-like lattices for the first time. Since
antiferromagnetic Ising model on Husimi lattice has been exactly solved and
successfully presented the melting and glass transition, the Phantom Cross-link
Network (PCN) is introduced here to understand the relationship between glassy
defect and long-range interactions in small molecule systems, and the concept
is inspired from the classical rubber network theory (Flory, 1985). One random
site out of four on the recursive unites with certain distance I (the net size)
is selected to be linked onto the PCN. The solutions are still in the fashion
of normal antiferromagnetic Ising model, with expected frustrations along with
the net size I. Beside the common Curie transition, several interesting
thermodynamics are observed in this toy model, and as the main found, PCN
clearly introduces glassy portion into the system, identified by the
supercooling behavior with lower TC, the metastable entropy curve and the
Kauzmann paradox.

<h3>Singular connection approach to topological phases and resonant optical  responses</h3>

<br>
<i>Bruno Mera, Tomoki Ozawa</i>
<br>
We introduce a class of singular connections as an alternative to the Berry
connection for any family of quantum states defined over a parameter space. We
find a natural application of the singular connection in the context of
transition dipoles between two bands. We find that the shift vector is nothing
but the difference between the singular connection and the connection induced
from the Berry connections of involved bands; the gauge invariance of the shift
vector is transparent from this expression. We show, using singular
connections, that the topological invariant in two dimensions associated with
optical transitions between the two bands can be computed, by means of this
connection, by algebraically counting the points in the zero locus of a
transition dipole matrix element of the two bands involved. It follows that
this invariant provides a natural topological lower bound on the number of
momenta in the Brillouin zone for which an electron cannot be excited from one
Bloch band to the other by absorbing a photon.

<h3>Superconductivity in doped triangular Mott insulators: the roles of  parent spin backgrounds and charge kinetic energy</h3>

<br>
<i>Zheng Zhu, Qianqian Chen</i>
<br>
We study the prerequisites for realizing superconductivity in doped
triangular-lattice Mott insulators by considering three distinct parent spin
backgrounds, i.e., $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnets, quantum spin liquid, and
stripy antiferromagnets, and all possible sign combinations $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$
of nearest-neighbor hopping and next-nearest-neighbor hopping $(t_1, t_2)$.
Based on density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we find that, with
finite $t_2$ and specific sign combinations $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$, the
quasi-long-range superconductivity order can always be achieved, regardless of
the nature of the parent spin backgrounds. Besides specific hopping signs
$(\tau_1, \tau_2)$, these superconductivity phases in triangular lattices are
commonly characterized by short-ranged spin correlations and two charges per
stripe. In the robust superconductivity phase realized at larger $t_2/t_1$,
flipping the signs $\tau_2$ and $\tau_1$ gives rise to the stripe phase without
strong pairing and pseudogap-like phase without Cooper-pair phase coherence,
respectively. Interestingly, the roles of the two hopping signs are switched at
smaller $t_2/t_1$. Moreover, different sign combinations $(\tau_1, \tau_2)$
would stabilize distinct phases including superconductivity, charge density
waves, spin density waves, and pseudogap-like phases accordingly. Our findings
suggest the important role of charge kinetic energy in realizing
superconductivity in doped triangular-lattice Mott insulators.

<h3>Gauge Invariance of the Thermal Conductivity in the Quantum Regime</h3>

<i>Axel Hübner, Santiago Rigamonti, Claudia Draxl</i>
<br>
The widely used linear-response (LR) theory of thermal conduction in the
quantum regime rests on the yet unproven assumption, that the thermal
conductivity is invariant with respect to the gauge of the energy density of
the system. This assumption manifests itself clearly in, e.g., Hardy's
formulation of the heat-flux operator [Phys. Rev. 132, 168 (1963)]. In this
work, we rigorously prove this assumption. Our proof, being valid for the
nuclear and electronic subsystems, not only puts the state-of-the-art theory on
solid grounds, but also enables going beyond the scope of the widely-used
Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) within the LR framework for many-body
systems.

<h3>First principles study on the mechanism of abnormal viscosity changeof  pure Al & Pb melts based on Wulff cluster mode</h3>

<br>
<i>Anchen Shao, Lina Hu, Lin Song, Minghao Hua, Jiajia Xue, Shuang Wu, Xuelei Tian, Xiaohang Lin</i>
<br>
In this paper, the Wulff cluster model combined phonon calculation is used to
investigate the relationship between the structure of metallic melts (Pb/Al)
and the abnormal viscosity change. Although absolute value of the surface
energy does not change significantly with temperature, the Wulff shape changed
evidently. When temperature raise to 975K, Pb(321) surface that has the highest
interaction strength completely disappears, while the abnormal viscosity drop
happens at the same temperature range. Oppositely, Al(100) surface that has the
lowest interaction strength disappears when temperature is higher than 1075K,
and at the same temperature range, the abnormal viscosity rise has been
observed. The abnormal viscosity drop corresponds to the disappearance of
surface with the highest interaction strength (Pb(321) surface), while the rise
one corresponds to the disappearance of surface with the lowest adsorption
energy (Al(100) surface). All evidence indicates that the uniformity between
abnormal viscosity change and the change of Wulff shape is not a coincidence. A
possible mechanism of the abnormal viscosity change is that it caused by the
significant structure change of cluster (short range ordering) in the metallic
melts.

<br>
We present a detailed analysis of the fundamental noise sources in
superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs), ac voltage biased at MHz
frequencies and treated as superconducting weak links. We have studied the
noise in the resistive transition as a function of bath temperature of several
detectors with different normal resistances and geometries. We show that the
excess noise, typically observed in the TES electrical bandwidth, can be
explained by the equilibrium Johnson noise of the quasiparticles generated
within the weak link. The fluctuations at the Josephson frequency and higher
harmonics contribute significantly to the measured voltage noise at the
detector bandwidth through the nonlinear response of the weak link with a
sinusoidal current-phase relation.

<br>
We investigated how SrOx segregates on a Nb doped SrTiO3 (100) surface by in
air annealing. Using atomic force and photoemission electron microscopes, we
can directly visualize the morphology and the electronic phase changes with
SrOx segregation. SrOx islands less than 2 micron meter in size and 1-5 unit
cells thick nucleate first and grow in a labyrinth domain pattern. After
prolonged annealing, SrOx forms a ~10 nm thick film. We show that the domain
pattern can be controlled by introducing a surface miscut angle of SrTiO3.
Additionally, the segregated SrOx has a lower work function, compared to that
of SrTiO3. These results suggest that the control and tunability of SrOx
segregation is applicable to the design of a new functional electronic devices
in the semiconducting SrTiO3 based heterostructure.

The Hubbard model is an important tool to understand the electrical

<br>
Understanding the spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic (AFM) thin films is
fundamental for designing novel devices based on AFM magnon transport. Here, we
study the magnon dynamics in thin films of AFM $S=5/2$ $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ by
combining resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, Anderson impurity model plus
dynamical mean-field theory, and the Heisenberg spin model. Below 100 meV, we
observe the thickness-independent (down to 15 nm) acoustic single magnon mode.
At higher energies (100-500 meV), an unexpected sequence of equally spaced,
optical modes is resolved and ascribed to $\Delta S_z = 1$, 2, 3, 4, and 5
magnetic excitations corresponding to multiple, non-interacting magnons. Our
study unveils the energy, character, and momentum-dependence of single- and
multi- magnons in $\alpha$-Fe2O3 thin films, with impact on AFM magnon
transport and its related phenomena. On a broader perspective, we generalize
the use of L-edge RIXS as a multi-spin excitation probe up to $\Delta S_z =
2S$. Our analysis identifies the spin-orbital mixing in the valence shell as
the key element for accessing excitations beyond $\Delta S_z = 1$, and up to,
e.g., $\Delta S_z = 5$. At the same time, we elucidate the novel origin of the
spin excitations beyond the $\Delta S_z = 2$, emphasizing the key role played
by the crystal lattice as a reservoir of angular momentum that complements the
quanta carried by the absorbed and emitted photons.

<br>
We experimentally investigate charge transport through a single planar
junction between a NiTe$_2$ Dirac semimetal and a normal gold lead. At
millikelvin temperatures we observe non-Ohmic $dV/dI(V)$ behavior resembling
Andreev reflection at a superconductor -- normal metal interface, while
NiTe$_2$ bulk remains non-superconducting. The conclusion on superconductivity
is also supported by suppression of the effect by temperature and magnetic
field. In analogy with the known results for Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal, we
connect this behavior with interfacial superconductivity due to the flat-band
formation at the Au-NiTe$_2$ interface. Since the flat-band and topological
surface states are closely connected, the claim on the flat-band-induced
superconductivity is also supported by the Josephson current through the
topological surface states on the pristine NiTe$_2$ surface. We demonstrate the
pronounced Josephson diode effect, which results from the momentum shift of
topological surface states of NiTe$_2$ under an in-plane magnetic field.

<br>
Janus transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers are fully artificial
materials, where one plane of chalcogen atoms is replaced by chalcogen atoms of
a different type. Theory predicts an in-built out-of-plane electric field,
giving rise to long-lived, dipolar excitons, while preserving direct-bandgap
optical transitions in a uniform potential landscape. Previous Janus studies
had broad photoluminescence (>15 meV) spectra obfuscating their excitonic
origin. Here, we identify the neutral, and negatively charged inter- and
intravalley exciton transitions in Janus WSeS monolayer with $\sim 6$ meV
optical linewidth. We combine a recently developed synthesis technique, with
the integration of Janus monolayers into vertical heterostructures, allowing
doping control. Further, magneto-optic measurements indicate that monolayer
WSeS has a direct bandgap at the K points. This work provides the foundation
for applications such as nanoscale sensing, which relies on resolving excitonic
energy shifts, and photo-voltaic energy harvesting, which requires efficient
creation of long-lived excitons and integration into vertical heterostructures.

<h3>Propagating charge carrier plasmon in Sr2RuO4</h3>

<br>
<i>Martin Knupfer, Fabian Jerzembeck, Naoki Kikugawa, Friedrich Roth, Joerg Fink</i>
<br>
We report on studies of charge carrier plasmon excitations in Sr2RuO4 by
transmission Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy. In particular, we present
results on the plasmon dispersion and its width as a function of momentum
transfer. The dispersion can be qualitatively explained in the framework of RPA
calculations, using an unrenormalized tight-binding band structure. The
constant long-wavelength width of the plasmon indicates, that it is caused by a
decay into inter-band transition and not by quantum critical fluctuations. The
results from these studies on a prototypical bad metal system show that the
long-wavelength plasmon excitations near 1 eV are caused by resilient
quasiparticles and are not influenced by correlation effects.

<h3>GaAs quantum dots under quasi-uniaxial stress: experiment and theory</h3>

<i>Xueyong Yuan, Saimon F. Covre da Silva, Diana Csontosova, Huiying Huang, Christian Schimpf, Marcus Reindl, Junpeng Lu, Zhenhua Ni, Armando Rastelli, Petr Klenovsky</i>
<br>
In this work we study GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots externally tuned by
quasi-uniaxial strain. We determine the magnitude of the applied uniaxial
strain from a combination of polarization-resolved photoluminescence of bulk
GaAs exciton and an eight-band ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ method. Knowing the
magnitude of applied strain and realistic quantum dot shape determined using
atomic force microscopy, the evolution of energy, fine-structure splitting,
degree of linear polarization, and azimuth of quantum dot exciton as a function
of the applied strain is thereafter studied. That study is done both
experimentally, using micro-photoluminescence, and theoretically, using a
combination of eight-band ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ formalism with multiparticle
corrections using the configuration interaction method. The main emphasis is
devoted to the testing of fidelity of the predictions of the theory model,
which takes as an input the realistic dot structure and the experimentally
obtained values of the applied strain tensor values and any other parameter
tuning of the model is allowed. Our theory model reproduces the experimental
data reasonably well. Finally, we develop a theory method for computation of
non-local optical transition of quantum dot exciton and using that, in
conjunction with experiment, we confirm the non-local nature of optical
transition in large GaAs quantum dots.

We propose a new but simpler explanation of the phases of a Frenkel-Kontorova

<h3>The Winner Takes It All: Carbon Supersedes Hexagonal Boron Nitride with  Graphene on Transition Metals at High Temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07020" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07020</a>
<br>
<i>Adrian Hemmi, Ari Paavo Seitsonen, Thomas Greber, Huanyao Cun</i>
<br>
The production of high-quality hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is essential
for the ultimate performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials-based devices,
since it is the key 2D encapsulation material. Here, a decisive guideline is
reported for fabricating high-quality h-BN on transition metals: It is crucial
to exclude carbon from h-BN related process. Otherwise carbon prevails over
boron and nitrogen due to its larger binding energy, thereupon forming graphene
on metals after high-temperature annealing. We demonstrate the surface
reaction-assisted conversion from h-BN to graphene with high-temperature
treatments. The pyrolysis temperature Tp is an important quality indicator for
h-BN/metals. When the temperature is lower than Tp, the quality of h-BN layer
is improved upon annealing. While the annealing temperature is above Tp, in
case of carbon-free conditions, the h-BN disintegrates and nitrogen desorbs
from the surface more easily than boron, eventually leading to clean metal
surfaces. However, once the h-BN layer is exposed to carbon, graphene forms on
Pt(111) in the high-temperature regime. This not only provides an indispensable
principle (avoid carbon) for fabricating high-quality h-BN materials on
transition metals, but also offers a straightforward method for the surface
reaction-assisted conversion from h-BN to graphene on Pt(111).

<h3>Coherent spin dynamics of excitons in strained monolayer semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>M. M. Glazov</i>
<br>
We develop a model of the exciton spin-valley dynamics in two-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenides under elastic strain. The strain splits the
exciton radiative doublet in linearly polarizes states. Consequently, it
induces an effective magnetic field acting on the exciton pseudospin and causes
its precession. As a result, circular polarization of excitons oscillates with
time and time-oscillating linear polarization appears. We study competition of
the strain-induced effective magnetic field with the field caused by the
exciton longitudinal-transverse splitting. We uncover different regimes of
coherent spin dynamics of two-dimensional excitons and show, in particular,
that for sufficiently large strain-induced and longitudinal-transverse
splittings two frequencies related to these splittings appear in the exciton
circular polarization beats.

<br>
We theoretically investigate in-medium two- and three-body correlations in
one-dimensional two-component Fermi gases with coexistent even-parity s-wave
and odd-parity p-wave interactions. We find the solutions of the stable
in-medium three-body cluster states such as Cooper triple by solving the
corresponding in-medium variational equations. We further feature the phase
diagram consisting of the s- and p-wave Cooper pairing phase, and Cooper
tripling phase, in the plane of s- and p-wave pairing strengths. The Cooper
tripling phase dominates over the pairing phases when both s- and p-wave
interactions are moderately strong.

<h3>Nonlocal drag by topological surface magnons in a pyrochlore ferromagnet</h3>

<br>
The nontrivial topology of quasiparticle wavefunctions can manifest
themselves in the form of observable surface states. This is now well
established in electronic systems, with Dirac and Weyl semimetals bringing to
fore the exotic nature of these topologically protected entities. Magnons -
which refer to collective excitations of localized spins - offer another sector
where many of these concepts could be realized. Here, we report magneto-thermal
measurements on a pyrochlore ferromagnet which is theoretically predicted to
host such topological magnons. It is demonstrated that the thermoelectric
potential across a metal layer deposited on single crystalline specimens of
Y$_2$V$_2$O$_7$ can be used to measure the magnon Hall effect. Moreover, a
direct manifestation of topologically protected magnon surface states is
observed - via the interfacial drag which these surface spin currents impose on
the conduction electrons of the adjacent metallic layer.

<br>
The CuIr$_{2-x}$Ru$_x$Te$_4$ superconductors (with a $T_c$ around 2.8 K) can
host charge-density waves, whose onset and interplay with superconductivity are
not well known at a microscopic level. Here, we report a comprehensive study of
the $x$ = 0 and 0.05 cases, whose superconductivity was characterized via
electrical-resistivity-, magnetization-, and heat-capacity measurements, while
their microscopic superconducting properties were studied via muon-spin
rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR). In CuIr$_{2-x}$Ru$_x$Te$_4$, both the
temperature-dependent electronic specific heat and the superfluid density
(determined via transverse-field $\mu$SR) are best described by a two-gap
(s+d)-wave model, comprising a nodeless gap and a gap with nodes. The multigap
superconductivity is also supported by the temperature dependence of the upper
critical field $H_\mathrm{c2}(T)$. However, under applied pressure, a
charge-density-wave order starts to develop and, as a consequence, the
superconductivity of CuIr$_2$Te$_4$ achieves a more conventional s-wave
character. From a series of experiments, we provide ample evidence that the
CuIr$_{2-x}$Ru$_x$Te$_4$ family belongs to the rare cases, where an
unconventional superconducting pairing is found near a charge-density-wave
quantum critical point.

<h3>A universality class for RNA-like polymers and double polymers</h3>

<br>
<i>Richard Dengler</i>
<br>
We examine the statistics of conformations of a linear polymer in a solvent.
The polymer is allowed to form double polymers. We closely follow a classical
technique to derive a field theory for the problem from an $O\left(n\right)$
symmetric spin model. The field theory is a model for RNA with constant binding
energy per monomer. Double polymer twisting is taken into account insofar as an
exchange of the two strands is allowed. The critical dimension is $8$, as it is
for simple polymer networks with excluded volume effect.
In contrast to simple polymer networks, we find that stable fixed points only
exist when there is a sufficiently strong excluded volume effect. One of these
fixed points describes complete pairing in the limit of strong binding energy.
Another stable fixed point describes a situation with comparable amounts of
single and double polymer. To reach this fixed point, at least one parameter
must be adjusted.

<h3>Are supercooled liquids Fickian yet non Gaussian?</h3>

Comment on `Fickian Non-Gaussian Diffusion in Glass-Forming Liquids', by
Rusciano et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 168001 (2022). In a recent Letter,
Rusciano et al. examined the statistics of individual particles displacements
in two-dimensional glass-formers and concluded that the corresponding
probability distribution is non-Gaussian in a time regime where the
mean-squared displacement is Fickian. Here, we clarify that the multiple length
scales and time scales reported in this work have either been characterized
before, or are not well-defined. This leads us to dispute the conclusions that
glass-formers display Fickian non-Gaussian behaviour and that this analogy
fruitfully addresses the central questions regarding the nature of dynamic
heterogeneity in these systems.

<br>
The real magnetic fields (MFs) acting on the graphene can induce flat real
Landau levels (LLs). As an analogy, strains in graphene can produce significant
pseudo MFs, triggering the appearance of dispersive pseudo LLs. By analysing
the low energy effective Hamiltonian, we introduce the concept of the effective
orbital MFs to integrate the real MFs and pseudo MFs. Accordingly, we obtain
the complex LLs which incorporate the real LLs and pseudo LLs, and calculate
the related transport properties. With the aid of these ideas, we reveal the
mechanism underlying the fragility of the pseudo LLs against disorders, and
predict that the $K$ and $K'$ valleys have different robust performances
against the Anderson disorders and dephasing effects. Furthermore, the
tunability of the polarized valley currents is also studied, opening up new
possibilities for the design of valleytronics devices.

Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic layers exhibit fascinating
physics and the potential for promising applications in superconducting logic
and memory. The junctions in a demonstrated superconducting memory prototype
contain a magnetic spin-valve structure with Ni as the fixed layer and NiFe
(Permalloy) as the free layer. However, NiFe exhibits poor supercurrent
transmission, which limits the efficiency of the Josephson junction device. We
have previously shown that the supercurrent transmission through a Cu/NiFe/Cu
trilayer can be improved by adding thin layers of Ni between the Cu and NiFe --
possibly due to the advantageous spin-dependent transport properties of the
Cu/Ni interfaces. In this work we explore this idea further by replacing the
Cu/NiFe interfaces with Pd/NiFe, which also have more desirable transport
properties. Compared to the reference junctions containing Cu/NiFe interfaces,
the new junctions exhibit an increase in the $\pi$-state supercurrent by a
factor of 2 along with a change in the position of the first 0-$\pi$
transition.

The creation of whole 3D objects in one shot is an ultimate goal for rapid
prototyping, most notably biofabrication, where conventional methods are
typically slow and apply mechanical or chemical stress on biological cells.
Here, we demonstrate one-step assembly of matter to form compact 3D shapes
using acoustic forces, which is enabled by the superposition of multiple
holographic fields. The technique is contactless and shown to work with solid
microparticles, hydrogel beads and biological cells inside standard labware.
The structures can be fixed via gelation of the surrounding medium. In contrast
to previous work, this approach handles matter with positive acoustic contrast
and does not require opposing waves, supporting surfaces or scaffolds. We
envision promising applications in tissue engineering and additive
manufacturing.

<h3>Tunneling conductance through gapped bilayer graphene junctions</h3>

<br>
The conductance through single-layer graphene (SLG) and AA/AB-stacked bilayer
graphene (BLG) junctions is obtained by taking into account band gap and bias
voltage terms. First, we consider gapped SLG, while in between, they are
connected into pristine BLG. For Fermi energy larger than the interlayer
hopping, the conductance as a function of the bilayer region length $d$ reveals
two different models of anti-resonances with the same period. As a function of
the band gap, with AA-BLG stacking, the results show that the conductance has
the same minima whatever the value of $d$, and for AB-BLG, $d$ remains relevant
such that the system creates a global energy gap. Second, we consider pristine
SLG, and in between, they are connected to gapped-biased BLG. We observe the
appearance of peaks in the conductance profile with different periods and
shapes, and also the presence of Klein tunneling with zero conductance in
contrast to the first configuration. When $ d $ is less than 10, $G(E)$
vanishes and exhibits anti-Klein tunneling as a function of the Fermi energy
$E$. We also investigate the conductance as a function of the bias. For AA-BLG,
the results show antiresonances and diminish for a large value of the bias,
independently of the bilayer region of length. In contrast, the conductance in
AB-BLG has distinct characteristics in that it begins conducting with maxima
for small $E$ and with minima for large $E$.

We discover superconductivity (SC) in LaAgSb$_2$ at ambient pressure and its
close correlation with a charge density wave (CDW) under pressure. The
superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) exhibits a sharp peak at the CDW
critical pressure of 3.2 GPa. We demonstrate that the carriers inhabiting the
Sb-square net is crucial not only in the formation of CDW but also in SC for
their relatively strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Furthermore,
theoretical EPC strength in pristine LaAgSb$_2$ cannot explain the observed
peak with $T_c\sim 1$ K, which indicates that an additional mechanism
reinforces SC only around the CDW critical pressure.

Experimental discovery that compressed sulphur hydride exhibits
superconducting transition temperature Tc=203 K (Drozdov et al 2015 Nature 525
73) sparked intensive studies of superconducting hydrides. However, this
discovery was not a straight forward experimental examination of theoretically
predicted phase, instead it was nearly five-decade long experimental quest for
superconductivity in highly-compressed matters, which varied from pure elements
(hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, lithium), cuprates, and hydrides (SiH4, YH3, and
AlH3), to semiconductors and ionic salts. One of these salts was cesium iodide,
CsI, which converts into metallic state at P=115 GPa and at P=180 GPa this
compound exhibits the onset of the superconducting transition temperature Tc~2
K (Eremets et al 1998 Science 281 1333). Detailed first principles calculations
(Xu et al 2009 Phys Rev B 79 144110) showed that within Eliashberg theory of
superconductivity, the CsI should exhibits Tc=0.03 K at pressure P=180 GPa,
which is by two orders of magnitude lower than the observed value. In attempt
to understand the nature of this discrepancy, here we analyzed temperature
dependent resistance in compressed CsI and found that this compound is perfect
Fermi liquid metal which exhibits extremely high (~ 17) ratio of the Debye
temperature, Td, to the Fermi energy, Tf. This implies that direct utilization
of the Eliashberg theory is incorrect for this compound, because the theory
valid for the ratio Td/Tf << 1. We also showed that highly-compressed CsI
exhibits the ratio of Tc/Tf = 0.04-0.07 and it falls in unconventional
superconductors band in the Uemura plot.

In this study, we discuss communities of densely connected structures and
k-clique percolation phenomenon as related to the human structural connectome.
We observe the existence of k-clique communities of high orders. The comparison
of 426 connectomes shows that individual connections form a bulk of large
k-clique communities and are critical for k-clique percolation phenomena. We
have also shown the existence of a subnetwork of more frequent connections,
considered as a core, which plays a key role in the formation of large-order
cliques, connectivity within communities of such structures and their
sustainability. The Erdos-Renyi model, for which the k-clique percolation
phenomenon is well described, was shown to be inconsistent with modeling the
formation of k-clique communities in the human structural connectome.for which
the k-clique percolation phenomenon is well described, was shown to be

<h3>The Random-Bond Ising Model and its dual in Hyperbolic Spaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Benedikt Placke, Nikolas P. Breuckmann</i>
<br>
We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the random-bond Ising model (RBIM)
on closed hyperbolic surfaces using Monte Carlo and high-temperature series
expansion techniques. We also analyze the dual-RBIM, that is the model that in
the absence of disorder is related to the RBIM via the Kramers-Wannier duality.
Even on self-dual lattices this model is different from the RBIM, unlike in the
euclidean case. We explain this anomaly by a careful re-derivation of the
Kramers--Wannier duality. For the (dual-)RBIM, we compute the
paramagnet-to-ferromagnet phase transition as a function of both temperature
$T$ and the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds $p$. We find that as
temperature is decreased in the RBIM, the paramagnet gives way to either a
ferromagnet or a spin-glass phase via a second-order transition compatible with
mean-field behavior. In contrast, the dual-RBIM undergoes a strongly first
order transition from the paramagnet to the ferromagnet both in the absence of
disorder and along the Nishimori line. We study both transitions for a variety
of hyperbolic tessellations and comment on the role of coordination number and
curvature. The extent of the ferromagnetic phase in the dual-RBIM corresponds
to the correctable phase of hyperbolic surface codes under independent bit- and
phase-flip noise.

<h3>Abundance of hard-hexagon crystals in the quantum pyrochlore  antiferromagnet</h3>

<i>Robin Schäfer, Benedikt Placke, Owen Benton, Roderich Moessner</i>
<br>
We propose a simple family of valence-bond crystals as potential ground
states of the $S=1/2$ and $S=1$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore
lattice. Exponentially numerous in the linear size of the system, these can be
visualized as hard-hexagon coverings, with each hexagon representing a
resonating valence-bond ring. This ensemble spontaneously breaks rotation,
inversion and translation symmetries. A simple, yet accurate, variational
wavefunction allows a precise determination of the energy, confirmed by DMRG
and numerical linked cluster expansion, and extended by an analysis of excited
states. The identification of the origin of the stability indicates
applicability to a broad class of frustrated lattices, which we demonstrate for
the checkerboard and ruby lattices. Our work suggests a perspective on such
quantum magnets, in which unfrustrated motifs are effectively uncoupled by the
frustration of their interactions.
