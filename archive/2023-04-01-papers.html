<h3>Microscopic derivation of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for  crystalline solid</h3>

We present a microscopic derivation of the nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic
equation for the homogeneous crystalline solid from the Hamiltonian description
of a many-particle system. We propose a microscopic expression of the
displacement field that correctly generates the nonlinear elastic properties of
the solid and find the nonlinear mode-coupling terms in reversible currents
which are consistent with the phenomenological equation. The derivation relies
on the projection onto the coarse-grained fields including the displacement
field, the long-wavelength expansion, and the stationarity condition of the
Fokker-Planck equation.

<h3>Electron Hydrodynamics by Spin Hall Effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electron hydrodynamics is currently known to emerge only when
electron-electron interaction dominates over the momentum-nonconserving
scatterings of electrons, where the electron transport is described by a
hydrodynamic equation. Here we show that electron transport in electron systems
with the spin Hall effect is also given by the hydrodynamic equation, whose
kinetic viscosity is determined by the spin diffusion length and the transport
lifetime. The electric current vorticity is proportional to the spin
accumulation due to the spin Hall effect in two-dimensional systems. We
demonstrate by solving the hydrodynamic equation in a two-dimensional system
with a cavity, combined with micromagnetic simulation for an attached chiral
magnetic insulator, that the spin accumulated near the boundary of the cavity
creates a magnetic skyrmion. Our findings and demonstration shed light on a
novel aspect of electron hydrodynamics and spin transport.

We consider the 1D Tonks-Girardeau gas with a space-dependent potential out
of equilibrium. We derive the exact dynamics of the system when divided into
$n$ boxes and decomposed into energy eigenstates within each box. It is a
representation of the wave function that is mixed between real space and
momentum space, whose basis elements are plane waves localized in a box,
motivating the word ``wavelet". In this representation we derive the emergence
of generalized hydrodynamics in appropriate limits without assuming local
relaxation. We emphasize in particular that a generalized hydrodynamic
behaviour emerges in a high-density and short-time limit, besides the more
common large-space and late-time limit, which is akin to a semi-classical
expansion. Besides, we show that this wavelet representation provides an
efficient numerical algorithm for a complete description of out-of-equilibrium
dynamics of hardcore bosons.

<h3>Strain correlations in isotropic elastic bodies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16910</a>
<br>
<i>J.P. Wittmer, A.N. Semenov, J. Baschnagel</i>
<br>
<br>
Strain correlation functions in two-dimensional isotropic elastic bodies are
shown both theoretically (using the general structure of isotropic tensor
fields) and numerically (using a glass-forming model system) to depend on the
coordinates of the field variable (position vector in real space or wavevector
in reciprocal space) and thus on the direction of the field vector and the
orientation of the coordinate system. Since the fluctuations of the
longitudinal and transverse components of the strain field in reciprocal space
are known in the long-wavelength limit from the equipartition theorem, all
correlation functions are imposed and no additional physical assumptions are
needed.

<h3>Stability of superconducting gap symmetries arising from  antiferromagnetic magnons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16916" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16916</a>
<br>
<i>Chi Sun, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a planar heterostructure consisting of a normal metal in
proximity to an antiferromagnetic insulator, with an interlayer
exchange-coupling between the metal and the insulator. The effective
electron-electron interaction between electrons in the normal metal, mediated
by antiferromagnetic magnons in the insulator, is derived to second order in
the interlayer exchange coupling, using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.
Particular emphasis is placed on including analytically derived expressions for
the effective interactions including Umklapp processes in the solutions to the
superconducting gap equation. The gap equation is first solved at the critical
temperature as an eigenvalue problem by linearizing the gap equation. The
eigenvectors yield information on the symmetry of the superconducting gap at
the onset of superconductivity, and we derive a phase-diagram for the
order-parameter in this case. In the various regimes of the phase-diagram, we
find $p$-wave, $f$-wave, and $d$-wave superconductivity, with $p$-wave
superconductivity in the dominant part of the phase diagram. Umklapp processes,
that come into play with increasing size of the Fermi surface, yield $f$- and
$d$-wave symmetries as the preferred symmetries when band filling approaches
half-filling. To investigate the stability of this order parameter symmetry as
the temperature is lowered, we also consider the nonlinear gap equation at zero
temperature. We conclude that the phase diagram and the symmetries of the
superconducting order parameter essentially are left intact as the temperature
is lowered to zero temperature.

<h3>Flat bands and multi-state memory devices from chiral domain wall  superlattices in magnetic Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we study the electronic structure and transport in magnetic
Weyl semimetal (MWSM) chiral domain wall (DW) superlattices. We show that the
device conductance is strongly modulated by the number of DWs between contacts,
providing a means to encode multiple resistance states in a single racetrack
device. Additionally, we show that periodic exchange fields can generate
tunable flat bands in the direction of transport as well as a chirality
filtering mechanism for Bloch DWs. This work elucidates both the physical
behavior and nanoelectronic potential for DW-MWSM devices.

<h3>Complete crystalline topological invariants from partial rotations in  (2+1)D invertible fermionic states and Hofstadter's butterfly</h3>

<i>Yuxuan Zhang, Naren Manjunath, Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli</i>
<br>
<br>
The theory of topological phases of matter predicts invariants protected only
by crystalline symmetry, yet it has been unclear how to extract these from
microscopic calculations in general. Here we show how to extract a set of
many-body invariants $\{\Theta_{\text{o}}^{\pm}\}$, where ${\text{o}}$ is a
high symmetry point, from partial rotations in (2+1)D invertible fermionic
states. Our results apply in the presence of magnetic field and Chern number $C
\neq 0$, in contrast to previous work. $\{\Theta_{\text{o}}^{\pm}\}$ together
with $C$, chiral central charge $c_-$, and filling $\nu$ provide a complete
many-body characterization of the topological state with symmetry group $G =
\text{U}(1) \times_\phi [\mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_M]$. Moreover, all
these many-body invariants can be obtained from a single bulk ground state,
without inserting additional defects. We perform numerical computations on the
square lattice Hofstadter model. Remarkably, these match calculations from
conformal and topological field theory, where $G$-crossed modular $S, T$
matrices of symmetry defects play a crucial role. Our results provide
additional colorings of Hofstadter's butterfly, extending recently discovered
colorings by the discrete shift and quantized charge polarization.

<h3>Microwave-Tunable Diode Effect in Asymmetric SQUIDs with Topological  Josephson Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16931</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph J. Cuozzo, Wei Pan, Javad Shabani, Enrico Rossi</i>
<br>
<br>
In superconducting systems in which inversion and time-reversal symmetry are
simultaneously broken the critical current for positive and negative current
bias can be different. For superconducting systems formed by Josephson
junctions (JJs) this effect is termed Josephson diode effect. In this work, we
study the Josephson diode effect for a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) formed by a topological JJ with a 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase
relationship and a topologically trivial JJ. We show how the fractional
Josephson effect manifests in the Josephson diode effect with the application
of a magnetic field and how tuning properties of the trivial SQUID arm can lead
to diode polarity switching. We then investigate the AC response and show that
the polarity of the diode effect can be tuned by varying the AC power and
discuss differences between the AC diode effect of asymmetric SQUIDs with no
topological JJ and SQUIDs in which one JJ is topological.

<h3>Exact Thermodynamics and Transport in the Classical Sine-Gordon Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16932" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16932</a>
<br>
<i>Rebekka Koch, Alvise Bastianello</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the exact thermodynamic description of the classical sine-Gordon
field theory, a notorious integrable model. We found that existing results in
the literature based on the soliton-gas picture did not correctly take into
account light, but extended, solitons and thus led to incorrect results. This
issue is regularized upon requantization: we derive the correct thermodynamics
by taking the semiclassical limit of the quantum model. Our results are then
extended to transport settings by means of Generalized Hydrodynamics.

<h3>Averting the infrared catastrophe in the gold standard of quantum  chemistry</h3>

Coupled-cluster theories can be used to compute electronic correlation
energies of ab initio systems with systematically improvable accuracy. However,
the widely-used coupled cluster singles and doubles plus erturbative triples
(CCSD(T)) method is only applicable to insulating systems. For zero-gap
materials the truncation of the underlying many-body perturbation expansion
leads to an infrared catastrophe. Here, we present a novel perturbative triples
formalism that yields convergent correlation energies in metallic systems.
Furthermore, the computed correlation energies for the three dimensional
uniform electron gas at metallic densities are in good agreement with quantum
Monte Carlo results. At the same time the newly proposed method retains all
desirable properties of CCSD(T) such as its accuracy for insulating systems as
well as its low computational cost compared to a full inclusion of the triples.
This paves the way for ab initio calculations of real metals with chemical
accuracy.

<h3>Importance of Many Particle Correlations to the Collective Debye-Waller  Factor in a Single-Particle Activated Dynamic Theory of the Glass Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16969" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16969</a>
<br>
<i>Ashesh Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the importance of many body correlations on the
collective Debye Waller (DW) factor in the context of the Nonlinear Langevin
Equation (NLE) single particle activated dynamics theory of glass transition
and its extension to include collective elasticity (ECNLE theory). This
microscopic force-based approach envisions structural alpha relaxation as a
coupled local-nonlocal process involving correlated local cage and longer range
collective barriers. The crucial question addressed here is the importance of
the deGennes narrowing contribution versus a literal Vineyard approximation for
the collective DW factor that enters the construction of the dynamic free
energy in NLE theory. While the Vineyard-deGennes approach-based NLE theory and
its ECNLE theory extension yields predictions that agree well with experimental
and simulation results, use of a literal Vineyard approximation for the
collective DW factor massively overpredicts the activated relaxation time. The
current study suggests many particle correlations are crucial for a reliable
description of activated dynamics theory of model hard sphere fluids.

<h3>Combinatorial sputter synthesis of single-phase La(XYZ)O$_{3\pmσ}$  perovskite thin film libraries: a new platform for materials discovery</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16970</a>
<br>
<i>Tobias H. Piotrowiak, Rico Zehl, Ellen Suhr, Benedikt Kohnen, Lars Banko, Alfred Ludwig</i>
<br>
<br>
Compositionally complex perovskites provide the opportunity to develop stable
and active catalysts for electrochemical applications. The challenge lies in
the identification of single-phase perovskites with optimized composition for
high electrical conductivity. Leveraging a recently discovered effect of
self-organized thin film growth during reactive sputtering, La-Co-Mn-O and
La-Co-Mn-Fe-O perovskite (ABO3) thin film materials libraries are synthesized.
These show phase-pure La-perovskites over a wide range of chemical composition
variation for the B-site elements for deposition temperatures equal to or
higher than 300$^\circ$C. It is demonstrated that this approach enables the
discovery and tailoring of chemical compositions for desired optical bandgap
and electrical conductivity, and thereby opens the path for the targeted
development of e.g. new high-performance electrocatalysts.

<h3>Hydrogen bonds in lead halide perovskites: insights from ab initio  molecular dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hydrogen bonds (HBs) play an important role in the rotational dynamics of
organic cations in hybrid organic/inorganic halide perovskites, affecting the
structural and electronic properties of the perovskites. However, the
properties and even the existence of HBs in these perovskites are not well
established. We investigate HBs in perovskites MAPbBr$_3$
(MA$^+$=CH$_3$NH$_3^+$), FAPbI$_3$ (FA$^+$= CH(NH$_2$)$_2^+$), and their solid
solution (FAPbI$_3$)$_{7/8}$(MAPbBr$_3$)$_{1/8}$, using ab initio molecular
dynamics and electronic structure calculations. We consider HBs donated by X-H
fragments (X=N, C) of the organic cations and accepted by the halides (Y=Br,
I), and characterize their properties based on pair distribution functions and
on a combined distribution function of hydrogen-acceptor distance with
donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle. By analyzing these functions, we establish
geometric criteria for HB existence based on hydrogen-acceptor distance
$d(H-Y)$ and donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle $\measuredangle(X-H-Y)$. The
distance condition is defined as $d(H-Y)<0.3$ nm, for N-H-donated HBs, and
$d(H-Y)<0.4$ nm for C-H-donated HBs. The angular condition is
$135{^\circ}\le\measuredangle(X-H-Y)\le 180{^\circ}$ for both types of HBs. At
the simulated temperature (350 K), the HBs dynamically break and form. We
compute time correlation functions of HB existence and HB lifetimes, which
range between 0.1 and 0.3 picoseconds at that temperature. The analysis of HB
lifetimes indicates that N-H--Br bonds are relatively stronger than N-H--I
bonds, while C-H--Y bonds are weaker. To evaluate the impact of HBs on
vibrational spectra, we present the power spectra, showing that peaks
associated with N-H stretching modes in perovskites are redshifted and
asymmetrically deformed compared with the peaks of isolated cations.

<h3>Evaluation and Refinement of the novel predictive electrolyte model  COSMO-RS-ES based on solid-liquid equilibria of salts and Gibbs free Energies  of Transfer of Ions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16980" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16980</a>
<br>
<i>Simon Müller, Christoph Taeschler, Andreas Klein, Irina Smirnova</i>
<br>
<br>
The new predictive electrolyte model COSMO-RS-ES is evaluated and refined for
the calculation of solubilities of salts in mixed solvent systems. It is
demonstrated, that the model is capable of predicting solid-liquid equilibria
at 25 {\deg}C for ammonium and alkali metal salts quite accurately in a wide
variety of solvent mixtures. Furthermore, through the introduction of Gibbs
free energies of transfer of single ions it is shown, that the model
performance can be improved even further. This new data type also allows for an
ion-specific way of evaluating the model for the first time. For some systems
when calculating the solubility, larger deviations are observed, but for the
vast majority of systems the model delivers good predictions. This shows, that
COSMO-RS-ES is a valuable tool for calculation of phase equilibria in
electrolyte systems especially when no or scare data impede the application of
models that require a higher number of parameters.

<h3>Broken symmetries and excitation spectra of interacting electrons in  partially filled Landau levels</h3>

<br>
Interacting electrons in flat bands give rise to a myriad of exotic quantum
phases from those discovered in Landau levels in high magnetic fields in
two-dimensional (2D) systems to more recently discovered novel phases in moire
materials. Fundamental to understanding of such states is probing the ordering
of various electrons' flavors, such as spin or valley, and the excitation
spectrum of the broken symmetry states that they form. These properties cannot
be probed directly with electrical transport measurements typically used to
study such states. The zeroth Landau level (ZLL) of monolayer graphene with
four-fold spin-valley isospin degeneracy is a model system for such
investigations, yet after more than a decade, the nature of its broken symmetry
states, particularly at partial fillings, is still not understood. Here we have
developed a non-invasive spectroscopic technique with the scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) to perform measurements of valley polarization of electronic
wavefunctions and their excitation spectrum in the partially filled ZLL of
graphene. In the electron density range in which we can compare our experiments
to theory, we find excellent agreement and extract important information such
as the strength of Haldane pseudopotentials that characterize the repulsive
interactions underlying the fractional quantum states. Beyond this regime, our
experiments uncover a surprising isospin phase transition in the presence of
robust particle-hole symmetry and demonstrate that fractional quantum Hall
phases are built upon broken symmetry states that persist at partial filling.
Our experimental approach quantifies the valley phase diagram of the partially
filled LL as a model flat-band platform that is applicable to other interacting
graphene-based electronic systems which can host related broken symmetry
states.

<h3>Designing transparent conductors using forbidden optical transitions</h3>

<br>
<i>Rachel Woods-Robinson, Yihuang Xiong, Jimmy-Xuan Shen, Nicholas Winner, Matthew K. Horton, Mark Asta, Alex M. Ganose, Geoffroy Hautier, Kristin A. Persson</i>
<br>
<br>
Many semiconductors present weak or forbidden transitions at their
fundamental band gaps, inducing a widened region of transparency. This occurs
in high-performing n-type transparent conductors (TCs) such as Sn-doped In2O3
(ITO), however thus far the presence of forbidden transitions has been
neglected in searches for new p-type TCs. To address this, we first compute
high-throughput absorption spectra across ~18,000 semiconductors, showing that
over half exhibit forbidden or weak optical transitions at their band edges.
Next, we demonstrate that compounds with highly localized band edge states are
more likely to present forbidden transitions. Lastly, we search this set for
p-type and n-type TCs with forbidden or weak transitions. Defect calculations
yield unexplored TC candidates such as ambipolar BeSiP2, Zr2SN2 and KSe, p-type
BAs, Au2S, and AuCl, and n-type Ba2InGaO5, GaSbO4, and KSbO3, among others. We
share our data set via the MPContribs platform, and we recommend that future
screenings for optical properties use metrics representative of absorption
features rather than band gap alone.

<h3>Magnetic Anisotropy and Its Structural Origins in Ru-Substituted  Manganite Films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Controlling magnetic anisotropy (MA) is important in a variety of
applications including magnetic memories, spintronic sensors, and
skyrmion-based data distribution. The perovskite manganite family provides a
fertile playground for complex, intricate, and potentially useful
structure-magnetism relations. Here we report on the MA that emerges in 10% Ru
substituted $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3}$ (Ru-LSMO) films for which strong
perpendicular magnetization and anisotropic in-plane magnetization are found.
These moderately compressively strained films possess a rich microstructure,
consisting of coherently strained phase which evolves into a one dimensional
(1D) periodically-modulated structure above a critical thickness. We illustrate
how 10% Ru substitution plays a crucial role behind the observed MA, and how
the structural distortion and 1D periodic structural modulation produce the
anisotropic in-plane magnetization. We highlight the practical significance of
the observed MA, which could pave the way towards the realization of
cutting-edge oxide-based room temperature spintronic memory devices.

<h3>Jarzynski equality for time-averaged work</h3>

<br>
There is evidence that taking the time average of the work performed by a
thermally isolated system "transforms" the adiabatic process into an isothermal
one. We add here one more fact to this case by showing that the time-averaged
difference of Helmholtz free energy is equal to the time-averaged quasistatic
work of the system. Therefore, a Jarzynski equality relating the time-averaged
work and time-averaged quasistatic work is established. As an immediate
consequence, the expected relation $\langle W\rangle\ge W_{\rm qs}$ is
demonstrated. Numerical evidence for the equality is also presented for the
classical harmonic oscillator with a driven linear equilibrium position
parameter.

The transport of active particles may occur in complex environments, in which
it emerges from the interplay between the mobility of the active components and
the quenched disorder of the environment. Here we explore structural and
dynamical properties of Active Brownian Particles (ABPs) in random environments
composed of fixed obstacles in three dimensions. We consider different
arrangements of the obstacles. In particular, we consider two particular
situations corresponding to experimentally realizable settings. Firstly, we
model pinning particles in (non--overlapping) random positions and secondly in
a percolating gel structure, and provide an extensive characterization of the
structure and dynamics of ABPs in these complex environments. We find that the
confinement increases the heterogeneity of the dynamics, with new populations
of absorbed and localized particles appearing close to the obstacles. This
heterogeneity has a profound impact on the motility induced phase separation
(MIPS) exhibited by the particles at high activity, ranging from nucleation and
growth in random disorder to a complex phase separation in porous environments.

Understanding quantum many-body systems is at the heart of condensed matter
physics. The ability to control the underlying lattice geometry of a system,
and thus its many-body interactions, would enable the realization of and
transition between emergent quantum ground states. Here, we report in-situ gate
switching between honeycomb and triangular lattice geometries of an electron
many-body Hamiltonian in R-stacked MoTe2 moir\'e bilayers, resulting in
switchable magnetic exchange interactions. At zero electric field, we observe a
correlated ferromagnetic insulator near one hole per moir\'e unit cell
({\nu}=-1), i.e., a quarter-filled honeycomb lattice, with a widely tunable
Curie temperature up to 14K. Fully polarizing layer pseudospin via electric
field switches the system into a half-filled triangular lattice with
antiferromagnetic interactions. Further doping this layer-polarized
superlattice introduces carriers into the empty layer, tuning the
antiferromagnetic exchange interaction back to ferromagnetic. Our work
demonstrates R-stacked MoTe2 moir\'es to be a new laboratory for engineering
correlated states with nontrivial topology.

The strongly correlated material La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) exhibits
metal-to-insulator and magnetic transition near room temperature. Although the
physical properties of LSMO can be manipulated by strain, chemical doping,
temperature, or magnetic field, they often require large external stimuli. To
include additional flexibility and tunability, we developed a hybrid
optoelectronic heterostructure that uses photocarrier injection from cadmium
sulfide (CdS) to an LSMO layer to change its electrical conductivity. LSMO
exhibits no significant optical response, however, the CdS/LSMO
heterostructures show an enhanced conductivity, with ~ 37 % resistance drop, at
the transition temperature under light stimuli. This enhanced conductivity in
response to light is comparable to the effect of a 9 T magnetic field in pure
LSMO. Surprisingly, the optical and magnetic responses of CdS/LSMO
heterostructures are decoupled and exhibit different effects when both stimuli
are applied. This unexpected behavior shows that heterostructuring strongly
correlated oxides may require a new understanding of the coupling of physical
properties across the transitions and provide the means to implement new
functionalities.

Bulk Dirac semimetals (DSMs) exhibit unconventional transport properties and
phase transitions due to their peculiar low-energy band structure. Yet the
electronic interactions governing nonequilibrium phenomena in DSMs are not
fully understood. Here we show that electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions in a
prototypical bulk DSM, Na3Bi, are predominantly two-dimensional (2D). Our
first-principles calculations discover a 2D optical phonon with strong e-ph
interactions associated with in-plane vibrations of Na atoms. We show that this
2D mode governs e-ph scattering and charge transport in Na3Bi, and induces a
dynamical phase transition to a Weyl semimetal. Our work advances quantitative
analysis of electron interactions in topological semimetals and reveals
dominant low-dimensional interactions in bulk quantum materials.

Hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms of steels have been studied for several
decades. Understanding hydrogen diffusion behavior in steels is crucial towards
both developing predictive models for hydrogen embrittlement and identifying
mitigation strategies. However, because hydrogen has a low atomic mass, it is
extremely challenging to detect by most analytical methods. In recent years,
cryogenic-transfer atom probe tomography (APT) of
electrochemically-deuterium-charged steels has provided invaluable qualitative
analysis of nanoscale deuterium traps such as carbides, dislocations, grain
boundaries and interfaces between ferrite and cementite. Independently, cyclic
voltammetry (CV) has provided valuable analysis of bulk hydrogen diffusion in
steels. In this work, we use a combination of CV and cryogenic-transfer APT for
quantitative analysis of deuterium pickup in electrolytically charged pure Fe
(ferrite) and a model austenitic Fe18Cr14Ni alloy without any second phase or
defect trap sites. The high solubility and low diffusivity of hydrogen in
austenite versus ferrite are highlighted to result in clear observable
signatures in CV and cryogenic-transfer APT results. The remaining challenges
and pathway for enabling quantitative analysis of hydrogen pick up in steels is
also discussed.

A microelectromechanical oscillator with a 0.73 $\mu$m gap structure is
employed to probe the surface Andreev bound states in superfluid $^3$He-B. The
surface specularity of the oscillator is increased by preplating it with 1.6
monolayers of $^4$He. In the linear regime, the temperature dependence of the
damping coefficient is measured at various pressures, and the normalized energy
gap is extracted. The damping coefficient increases after preplating at lower
pressures, which is attributed to the decreased energy minigap of the surface
bound states. The device is also driven into the nonlinear regime, where the
temperature independent critical velocity at each pressure is measured. The
critical velocity is observed to increase after preplating at all pressures,
which might be related to the increased average energy gap. The observed
behavior warrants a microscopic theory beyond a single parameter
characterization of the surface.

We give an exact matrix product steady state and matrix product forms of
local observables for the bulk impurity-doped XXZ spin model coupled to
dissipators at both ends, whose dynamics is described by the Lindblad quantum
master equation. We find that local magnetization is induced at the impurity
site when the spin current flows, which is contrary to the usual situation
where current suppresses magnetization due to heating. It is proved that this
current-induced magnetization survives in the thermodynamic limit, and the spin
current does not depend on the impurity strength. We discuss the role of bulk
integrability by comparing the results with those of non-integrable models
solved numerically by the quantum trajectory method.

<br>
<br>
We numerically investigate photo-responses of the charge ordered state upon
stimuli of pulsed laser light, especially paying attention to the differences
in the pulse width, whose shortness has been a key to experimentally realize
large photo-induced effects. As a model for charge ordering, we consider an
interacting spinless fermion model on a one-dimensional chain coupled to
classical phonons and numerically simulate its real-time dynamics. First, we
demonstrate the case where spatially uniform dynamics take place, and show the
delayed response of phonons after the photo-irradiation causing destabilization
of charge order. When a local impurity potential is introduced in the initial
state, an inhomogeneous charge order melting occurs and the delay in the time
scale also happens in the real space melting process. Finally, by investigating
wider parameter ranges using different pulse widths, we find that the use of
ultrashort pulses considerably expands the frequency window for charge order
melting; it is indispensable in realizing the photo-induced phase transition
with off-resonant conditions.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is an element-specific materials
characterization technique that is sensitive to structural and electronic
properties. First-principles simulated XAS has been widely used as a powerful
tool to interpret experimental spectra and draw physical insights. Recently,
there has also been growing interest in building computational XAS databases to
enable data analytics and machine learning applications. However, there are
non-trivial differences among commonly used XAS simulation codes, both in
underlying theoretical formalism and in technical implementation. Reliable and
reproducible computational XAS databases require systematic benchmark studies.
In this work, we benchmarked Ti K-edge XAS simulations of ten representative
Ti-O binary compounds, which we refer to as the Ti-O-10 dataset, using three
state-of-the-art codes: xspectra, ocean and exciting. We systematically studied
the convergence behavior with respect to the input parameters and developed a
workflow to automate and standardize the calculations to ensure converged
spectra. Our benchmark comparison shows: (1) the two Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE) codes (ocean and exciting) have excellent agreement in the energy range
studied (up to 35 eV above the onset) with an average Spearman's rank
correlation score of 0.998; (2) good agreement is obtained between the
core-hole potential code (xspectra) and BSE codes (ocean and exciting) with an
average Spearman's rank correlation score of 0.990. Our benchmark study
provides important standards for first-principles XAS simulations with broad
impact in data-driven XAS analysis.

We study the effect of the energy gap on the transmission of fermions in
graphene exposed to linearly polarized light as a laser barrier. We determine
the energy spectrum, apply boundary conditions at interfaces, and use the
transfer matrix approach to obtain transmissions for all energy modes. We show
that when the energy gap increases, the oscillations of transmissions decrease
dramatically until they vanish entirely. However, when the barrier width
varies, the oscillations become more significant and exhibit sharp peaks. By
increasing the incident energy, the laser field suppresses the Fabry-P\'erot
resonance, and the transmissions move to the right when the energy gap is
tuned.

We examine the possible existence of Dirac semimetal with magnetic order in
two-dimensional system with a nonsymmorphic symmetry by using mean-field theory
within the Hubbard model. We locate the region in the spin-orbit coupling vs
Hubbard interaction phase diagram, where such a state is stabilized. The edge
states for ribbons extending along both the $x$ and $y$ directions are
obtained. Then, we comment on the feasibility of such a state when the $SU(2)$
symmetric nature of the Hubbard interaction is considered. Finally, the effects
of magnetic field on the Dirac semimetallic states and corresponding edge
states are also explored.

We present an epitaxial stabilization of pyrochlore Bi$_2$Rh$_2$O$_7$ on
Y-stabilized ZrO$_2$ (YSZ) (111) substrate by inserting a pyrochlore
Eu$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ template layer, otherwise Bi-based layered structures being
formed directly on YSZ (111) substrate. This result reveals that
"iso-structural crystal phase" plays an important role in the interfacial phase
control. The Bi$_2$Rh$_2$O$_7$ film exhibits $p$-type electrical conduction
with the lowest longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_\mathrm{xx}$) among the
reported Rh pyrochlore oxides. Such parameters as $\rho_\mathrm{xx}$, carrier
density, and mobility show almost no temperature dependence in the measured
range of 2$-$300 K, indicating Bi$_2$Rh$_2$O$_7$ as one of the rare examples of
conducting pyrochlore oxides.

When granular mixtures of different sizes are fluidized, each species
spontaneously separates and condenses to form patterns. Although granular
segregation has been extensively studied, the inability to directly observe the
time evolution of the internal structure hinders the understanding of the
mechanism of segregation dynamics driven by surface flow. In this study, we
report rich band dynamics, including a self-replicating band, in a horizontally
shaken granular mixture in a quasi-two-dimensional container where the granules
formed steady surface waves. Direct observation of surface flow and segregated
internal structure revealed that coupling among segregation, surface flow, and
hysteresis in the fluidity of granules is key to understanding complex band
dynamics.

<br>
<br>
Simultaneous study of magnetic and electrocatalytic properties of cobaltites
under extreme conditions expands understanding of physical and chemical
processes proceeding in them with the possibility of their further practical
application. Therefore, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSCO) nanopowders have been synthesized
at different annealing temperatures tann = 850, 875, 900 C, and their
multifunctional properties have been studied comprehensively. As tann
increases, the rhombohedral perovskite structure of the LSCO becomes more
single-phase, whereas average particle size and dispersion grow. Co ions are in
mixed valence states, including major Co3+ and Co4+ components. It has been
found that the LSCO-900 shows two main Curie temperatures, TC1 and TC2,
associated with a particle size distribution. As an external hydrostatic
pressure P increases, average <TC1> and <TC2> increase from 253 and 175 K under
ambient pressure to 268 and 180 K under P = 0.8 GPa, respectively. At the same
time, the antiferromagnetic temperature TAFM and blocking temperature TB also
increase from 145 and 169 K to 158 and 170 K, respectively. The increment of
<dTC/dP> for the smaller and bigger particles is sufficiently high and equals
10 and 13 K/GPa, respectively. The magnetocaloric effect in the LSCO-900
nanopowder is relatively weak but with an extremely wide peak > 50 K that makes
this composition interesting to be used as one of the components of the
composite expanding its working temperature window. Moreover, all LSCO samples
showed excellent electrocatalytic performance for the overall water splitting
(OER) process (overpotentials only 265-285 mV at a current density of 10
mA/cm2) with minimal values for LSCO-900. Based on the XPS data, it was found
that the formation of a dense amorphous layer on the surface of the particles
ensures high stability as a catalyst (at least 24 h) during electrolysis in 1 M
KOH electrolyte.

<h3>Physics-based bias-dependent compact modeling of 1/f noise in single- to  few- layer 2D-FETs</h3>

<br>
<br>
1/f noise is a critical figure of merit for the performance of transistors
and circuits. For two-dimensional devices (2D-FETs), and especially for
applications in the GHz range where short-channel FETs are required, velocity
saturation (VS) effect can result in the reduction of 1/f noise at high
longitudinal electric fields. A new physics-based compact model is for the
first time introduced for single- to few- layer 2D-FETs in this study,
precisely validating 1/f noise experiments for various types of devices. The
proposed model mainly accounts for the measured 1/f noise bias dependence as
the latter is defined by different physical mechanisms. Thus, analytical
expressions are derived, valid in all regions of operation in contrast to
conventional approaches available in literature so far, accounting for carrier
number fluctuation (DN), mobility fluctuation (Dmu}) and contact resistance
(DR) effects based on the underlying physics that rules these devices. DN
mechanism due to trapping/detrapping together with an intense Coulomb
scattering effect, dominates 1/f noise from medium to strong accumulation
region while Dmu, is also demonstrated to modestly contribute in subthreshold
region. DR can also be significant in very high carrier density. The VS induced
reduction of 1/f noise measurements at high electric fields, is also remarkably
captured by the model. The physical validity of the model can also assist in
extracting credible conclusions when conducting comparisons between
experimental data from devices with different materials or dielectrics.

<h3>On the analogy between the restricted primitive model and capacitor  circuits. Part II: A generalized Gibbs-Duhem consistent extension of the  Pitzer-Debye-Hückel term with corrections for low and variable relative  permittivity</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrés González de Castilla, Simon Müller, Irina Smirnova</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a novel, generalized and thermodynamically consistent modification
of the Pitzer-Debye-H\"uckel term that can include concentration dependent
density, molar mass and relative permittivity within the derivation. In
contrast to similar developments, this extension is applicable to simple salts
with small spherical ions as well as ionic liquids in aqueous, mixed or
non-aqueous solvents. Its central feature is the inclusion of a modified
parameter of closest approach, which improves the overall theoretical accuracy
of the Pitzer-Debye-H\"uckel term when applied in variable or very low relative
permittivity media. Gibbs-Duhem consistency is retained in the modified
extension and sample calculations for aqueous [BMIM][BF4] and aqueous NaCl are
provided. This novel Pitzer-Debye-H\"uckel extension with a concentration
dependent relative permittivity is applied with the predictive COSMO-RS-ES
model for the calculation of phase equilibria and activity coefficients in
electrolyte systems. The performance of the COSMO-RS-ES model for correlations
and predictions improves considerably upon consistent introduction of mixture
properties in the long-range term. For the first time, the model is capable of
satisfactorily calculating activity coefficients and phase equilibria in
aqueous, mixed and non-aqueous electrolytes up to very high salt
concentrations. The present work also demonstrates that the COSMO-RS-ES model
effectively counter-balances its lack of a Born and hard sphere terms, which
are commonly applied when a salt concentration dependent relative permittivity
is being consistently considered. Finally, our results support the consistent
inclusion of a concentration dependent relative permittivity in order to
improve the modelling of electrolytes.

<h3>Characterization of random features of chaotic eigenfunctions in  unperturbed basis</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiaozi Wang, Wen-ge Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we study random features manifested in components of energy
eigenfunctions of quantum chaotic systems, given in the basis of unperturbed,
integrable systems. Based on semiclassical analysis, particularly on Berry's
conjecture, it is shown that the components in classically allowed regions can
be regarded as Gaussian random numbers in certain sense, when appropriately
rescaled with respect to the average shape of the eigenfunctions. This suggests
that, when a perturbed system changes from integrable to chaotic, deviation of
the distribution of rescaled components in classically allowed regions from the
Gaussian distribution may be employed as a measure for the ``distance'' to
quantum chaos. Numerical simulations performed in the LMG model and the Dicke
model show that this deviation coincides with the deviation of the
nearest-level-spacing distribution from the prediction of random-matrix theory.
Similar numerical results are also obtained in two models without classical
counterpart.

<br>
<br>
Control of the Coulomb interaction between single electrons is vital for
realizing quantum information processing using flying electrons and,
particularly, for the realization of deterministic two-qubit operations. Since
the strength of the Coulomb interaction increases with decreasing distance, a
collision experiment of single electrons would be an ideal way to investigate
it. Moreover, it would be useful to study such a Coulomb collision in silicon
system, which has been extensively studied for qubit applications but so far
has not been used for making Coulomb collisions at the single-electron level.
Here, we made two series-coupled tunable-barrier single-electron pumps in
silicon and used one to inject a hot single electron into the other pump in
each pumping cycle. The hot single electron collides with a cold single
electron confined in the other single-electron pump. We observed a current flow
due to ejection not only of the hot single electron but also of the confined
cold single electron. The latter leads to an excess current at a current
plateau at a certain voltage range. We also found that increasing the number of
cold electrons from one to two increased the cold-electron current by at least
twofold. These results can be explained by a charging effect due to the Coulomb
interaction. This observation is an important step toward quantum manipulation
of flying single electrons in silicon.

We consider a system of $N$ non-crossing Brownian particles in one dimension.
We find the exact rate function that describes the long-time large deviation
statistics of their occupation fraction in a finite interval in space.
Remarkably, we find that, for any general $N \geq 2$, the system undergoes
$N-1$ dynamical phase transitions of second order. The $N-1$ transitions are
the boundaries of $N$ phases that correspond to different numbers of particles
which are in the vicinity of the interval throughout the dynamics. We achieve
this by mapping the problem to that of finding the ground-state energy for $N$
noninteracting spinless fermions in a square-well potential. The phases
correspond to different numbers of single-body bound states for the quantum
problem. We also study the process conditioned on a given occupation fraction
and the large-$N$ limiting behavior.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experimental detection of superconductivity in Bernal
bilayer (AB) and rhombohedral trilayer (ABC) graphene, we study the emergence
of superconductivity in multilayer graphene based on a Kohn-Luttinger (KL)-like
mechanism in which the pairing glue is the screened Coulomb interaction. We
find that electronic interactions alone can drive superconductivity in AB
bilayer graphene and ABC trilayer graphene with the critical temperatures in
good agreement with the experimentally observed ones, allowing us to further
predict superconductivity from electronic interactions in Bernal ABA trilayer
and ABAB tetralayer and rhombohedral ABCA tetralayer graphene. By comparing the
critical temperatures ($T_c$) of these five non-twisted graphene stacks, we
find that the ABC trilayer graphene possesses the highest $T_c\sim100$ mK.
After considering the enhancement of superconductivity due to Ising spin-orbit
coupling, we observe that the AB bilayer graphene has the largest enhancement
in the critical temperature, increasing from 23 mK to 143 mK. The
superconducting behaviors in these non-twisted graphene stacks could be
explained by the order parameters (OPs). The OPs of Bernal stacks preserve
intravalley $C_3$ symmetry, whereas rhombohedral stacks break it. In all
stacks, the OPs have zeroes and change signs between valleys, which means that
these multilayers of graphene are nodal spin-triplet superconductors. Moreover,
dressing the purely electronic interaction with acoustic phonons, we observe
minor changes of the critical temperatures in these five stacks. We adopt the
KL-like mechanism to investigate the tendency of superconductivity in
multilayer graphene without fitting parameters, which could provide guidance to
future experiments exploring superconductivity in non-twisted graphene.

<h3>Are there universal signatures of topological phases in high harmonic  generation? Probably not</h3>

High harmonic generation (HHG) has developed in recent years as a promising
tool for ultrafast materials spectroscopy. At the forefront of these
advancements, several works proposed to use HHG as an all-optical probe for
topology of quantum matter by identifying its signatures in the emission
spectra. However, it remains unclear if such spectral signatures are indeed a
robust and general approach for probing topology. To address this point, we
perform here a fully ab-initio study of HHG from prototypical two-dimensional
topological insulators in the Kane-Mele quantum spin-Hall and anomalous-Hall
phases. We analyze the spectra and previously proposed topological signatures
by comparing HHG from the topological and trivial phases. We demonstrate and
provide detailed microscopic explanations of why in these systems none of the
thus far proposed observables uniquely and universally probe material topology.
Specifically, we find that the: (i) HHG helicity, (ii) anomalous HHG
ellipticity, (iii) HHG elliptical dichroism and (iv) temporal delays in HHG
emission, are all unreliable signatures of topological phases. Our results
suggest that extreme care must be taken when interpreting HHG spectra for
topological signatures, and that contributions from the crystal symmetries and
chemical nature might be dominant over those from topology. They hint that a
truly universal topological signature in nonlinear optics is unlikely, and
raise important questions regarding possible utilization and detection of
topology in systems out-of-equilibrium.

The study of interaction between electromagnetism and elementary particles is
a long-standing topic in physics. Likewise, the connection between particle
physics and emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics is a recurring theme
and condensed matter physics has often provided a platform for investigating
the interplay between particles and fields in cases that have not been observed
in high-energy physics, so far. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, we provide a new example of this by visualizing the electronic
structure of a noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate NdAlSi in
both the paramagnetic and ferrimagnetic states. We observe surface Fermi arcs
and bulk Weyl fermion dispersion as well as the regulation of Weyl fermions by
ferrimagnetism. Our results establish NdAlSi as a magnetic Weyl semimetal and
provide the first experimental observation of ferrimagnetic regulation of Weyl
fermions in condensed matter.

The response of materials to dynamical, or shock, loading is important to
planetary science, aerospace engineering, and energetic materials.
Thermal-activated processes, including chemical reactions and phase
transitions, are significantly accelerated by the localization of the energy
deposited into hotspots. These results from the interaction of a supersonic
wave with the materials microstructure and are governed by complex, coupled
processes, including the collapse of porosity, interfacial friction, and
localized plastic deformation. These mechanisms are not fully understood and
today we lack predictive models to, for example, predict the shock to
detonation transition from chemistry and microstructure alone. We demonstrate
that deep learning techniques can be used to predict the resulting
shock-induced temperature fields in complex composite materials obtained from
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with the initial microstructure as
the only input. The accuracy of the Microstructure-Informed Shock-induced
Temperature net (MISTnet) model is higher than the current state of the art at
a fraction of the computation cost.

<h3>Highly tunable NbTiN Josephson junctions fabricated with focused helium  ion beam</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17348</a>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a "direct writing" method for the fabrication of planar
Josephson junctions from high quality superconducting niobium titanium nitride
(NbTiN) thin films using focused He-ion beam irradiation. Compared to the
materials previously used in such processing, YBCO and MgB$_2$, NbTiN has much
better mechanical and electrical properties, as well as good corrosion
resistance. We show that we can control the suppression of superconductivity in
NbTiN as a function of the helium ion beam fluence, and that this controllable
critical temperature suppression combined with the high spatial resolution and
position control of the He-ion beam in a helium ion microscope enables us to
successfully fabricate Josephson junctions with highly tunable weak links.
Because of the continuous nature of the disorder-induced metal-insulator
transition, this method allows the creation of barriers with wide range of
resistivities ranging from the metallic to the insulating state, with the
critical current and the junction resistance varying over two orders of
magnitude. Electrical transport measurements show that junctions follow closely
the ideal resistively and capacitively shunted junction behavior, have high
characteristic voltages ($0.2-1.4$ mV) and show Shapiro steps up to very high
orders. This suggests that these type of junctions are suitable for a wide
range of applications in superconducting electronics and quantum information
technology, with the bonus that a whole device can be fabricated from just a
single thin film, with the excellent electrical and microwave characteristics
offered by NbTiN.

<h3>Partial condensation of mobile excitons in graphene multilayers</h3>

<br>
At a large displacement field, in rhomboedral and Bernal-stacked graphene a
normal paramagnetic state transitions to a correlated state. Recent experiments
showed that such systems have several phase transitions as a function of the
carrier density. The phase adjacent to a paramagnetic state has anomalously
high resistance and reduced degeneracy of the Fermi sea. We show that both
phenomena can be explained through a concept of partial intervalley exciton
condensation: a fraction of particles condenses into excitons, and another
forms an intervalley coherent Fermi liquid. The exciton part of the system do
not contribute to the electrical current thus increasing the resistance. Within
this paradigm, the increase in the resistance has entirely geometrical origin.
We check validity of the phenomenological theory through numerical
calculations. We also show that the quantum oscillation data should not be very
different between the partial excitonic state and the intervalley coherent
states suggested by other authors. Further, we suggest STM/AFM or Raman
spectroscopy to have a conclusive evidence for the occurrence of the partial
exciton condensation that we suggest in this paper.

<h3>Lateral quantum confinement effect on monolayer high-Tc superconductors</h3>

<br>
A fundamental problem in superconductivity research is to understand the
modification of superconductivity from reduced length scales. Despite decades
of research in spatially confined superconducting systems, a systematic
investigation of the lateral quantum confinement effect on high-temperature
superconductors is still rare and desired. Here, we report the scanning
tunneling spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference measurements on laterally
confined FeSe monolayers on SrTiO3 substrates, which are formed by epitaxially
growing FeSe films with the coverage less than one unit cell. Comparing to the
uniform regions of FeSe monolayers, the peninsulas regions at the monolayer
boundary show a reduced Fermi energy and undiminished superconductivity,
leading to a crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state to Bose-Einstein
condensate state. In isolated FeSe monolayer islands, superconductivity is
illustrated to exist in samples of smaller volume in contrast to conventional
superconductors, while the validity of Anderson criterion is still verified.
Our work reveals the lateral quantum confinement effect on superconductors at
the two-dimensional limit, and may shed light on the understanding of
unconventional superconductivity in low-dimensional systems.

<h3>Angular dependence of the electrically driven and detected ferromagnetic  resonance in Ni$_{36}$Fe$_{64}$ wires</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the angular dependence of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in
Ni$_{36}$Fe$_{64}$ wires using both traditional microwave-absorption and
electrical-detection techniques. In our experiments we apply a static magnetic
field at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the wire, while the microwave
current, which is responsible for driving FMR, is always flowing along the
wire. For different $\theta$s we find a very similar behavior for both
microwave-absorption and electrically-detected FMR -- the resonance magnetic
field follows a simple "$1/\cos(\theta)$" dependence. This simple behavior
highlights the importance of the relative orientation between the driving
current and magnetic field. We also investigated the dependence of the
electrically detected FMR on dc and rf (microwave) current magnitudes. As
expected, the resonance signal increases linearly with both the applied dc
current and the microwave power.

<h3>Probing the Superconducting Pairing Potential via Dynamical Coulomb  Blockade</h3>

<br>
<br>
Coulomb blockade occurs for electrons tunneling into nanoislands because of
the quantization of charges. Here, using spectroscopy measurements of
nonmagnetic islands grown on a high-Tc superconductor [one-unit-cell (1-UC)
FeSe], we employ dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB) as a tool to probe the nature
of Cooper pairing in the superconducting substrate. The tunneling spectra are
acquired on single-crystalline Pb nanoislands, and show a clear suppression of
the tunneling current around zero bias-voltage, i.e. a gap-like structure. The
observed spectral gaps can be attributed to DCB based on our comprehensive
investigations, including experiments with finely varying island sizes and
calculations of the spectra using the P(E) theory of DCB. Our detailed analysis
suggests that the observed DCB can be assigned to the sign-reversing pairing
potential for the 1-UC FeSe substrate below the islands. The sign reversal is
furthermore reflected in a transition of the superconducting gap of FeSe from a
U- to a V-like lineshape as the distance between neighboring doublet islands is
decreased, indicating the presence of a nodal-like gap as expected for a
sign-reversing superconductor. Our configuration of nonmagnetic nanoislands on
a high-Tc superconductor for spectroscopy measurements may serve as a local,
spatially sensitive, and tunable probe for detecting the sign-reversing order
parameter in unconventional superconductors.

<h3>Exact dynamics of two holes in two-leg antiferromagnetic ladders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17381" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17381</a>
<br>
<i>K. Knakkergaard Nielsen</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the motion of holes in a mixed-dimensional setup of an
antiferromagnetic ladder, featuring nearest neighbor hopping $t$ along the
ladders and Ising-type spin interactions along, $J_\parallel$, and across,
$J_\perp$, the ladder. We determine exact solutions for the low-energy one- and
two-hole eigenstates. The presence of the trans-leg spin coupling, $J_\perp$,
leads to a linear confining potential between the holes. As a result, holes on
separate legs feature a super-linear binding energy scaling as $(J_\perp /
t)^{2/3}$ in the strongly correlated regime of $J_\perp,J_\parallel \leq t$.
This behavior is linked to an emergent length scale $\lambda \propto
(t/J_\perp)^{1/3}$, stemming from the linear confining potential, and which
describes how the size of the two-hole molecular state diverges for
$J_\perp,J_\parallel \ll t$. On the contrary, holes on the same leg unbind at
sufficiently low spin couplings. This is a consequence of the altered
short-range boundary condition for holes on the same leg, yielding an effective
Pauli repulsion between them, limiting their kinetic energy and making binding
unfavorable. Finally, we determine the exact nonequilibrium quench dynamics
following the sudden immersion of initially localized nearest neigbhor holes.
The dynamics is characterized by a crossover from an initial ballistic quantum
walk to an aperiodic oscillatory motion around a finite average distance
between the holes due to the confining potential between them. In the strongly
correlated regime of low spin couplings, $J_\perp, J_\parallel \leq t$, we find
this asymptotic distance to diverge as $t / J_\perp$, showing a much stronger
scaling than the eigenstates. The predicted results should be amenable to
state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments using currently implemented
experimental techniques.

<h3>Large deviations in stochastic dynamics over graphs through Matrix  Product Belief Propagation</h3>

Stochastic processes on graphs can describe a great variety of phenomena
ranging from vehicular traffic to neural activity and epidemic spreading. While
many existing methods can accurately describe typical realizations of such
processes, computing properties of extremely rare events is generally a hard
task. In particular, good approximations are lacking for models with recurrent
dynamics, in which variables can return to a previously visited state.
Recently, a scheme based on the cavity method with messages parametrized by
matrix product states [T. Barthel, C. De Bacco, and S. Franz, Physical Review E
97, 010104 (2018)] has been shown to work well for typical trajectories. In
this work, we build on this approach in two directions: first, we show how,
using a general formulation of the belief propagation equations instead of the
dynamical cavity method, it can be applied to Markov processes biased by
arbitrary reweighting factors that concentrate most of the probability mass on
rare events. Second, we introduce an efficient scheme to reduce the
computational cost of a single node update from exponential to polynomial in
the node degree, allowing to apply the method to graphs of large connectivity.
Two applications are considered. First, we compute individual infection
probabilities from sparse observations within the SIRS epidemic model (the risk
assessment problem). Second, we compute typical observables and large
deviations of Glauber dynamics on several Ising models, including a random
field ferromagnet and a spin glass.

<h3>Gate-dependent non-linear Hall effect at room temperature in topological  semimetal GeTe</h3>

<br>
<br>
We experimentally investigate non-linear Hall effect as zero-frequency and
second-harmonic transverse voltage responses to ac electric current for
topological semimetal GeTe. A thick single-crystal GeTe flake is placed on the
Si/SiO$_2$ substrate, where the p-doped Si layer serves as a gate electrode. We
confirm, that electron concentration is not gate-sensitive in thick GeTe flakes
due to the gate field screening by bulk carriers. In contrast, by transverse
voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the non-linear Hall effect shows
pronounced dependence on the gate electric field at room temperature. Since the
non-linear Hall effect is a direct consequence of a Berry curvature dipole in
topological media, our observations indicate that Berry curvature can be
controlled by the gate electric field. This experimental observation can be
understood as a result of the known dependence of giant Rashba splitting on the
external electric field in GeTe. For possible applications, the zero-frequency
gate-controlled non-linear Hall effect can be used for the efficient broad-band
rectification.

<h3>Pressure induced color change and evolution of metallic behavior in  nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride</h3>

<br>
<i>Ying-Jie Zhang, Xue Ming, Qing Li, Xiyu Zhu, Bo Zheng, Yuecong Liu, Chengping He, Huan Yang, Hai-Hu Wen</i>
<br>
<br>
By applying pressures up to 42 GPa on the nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride
(LuH$_{2\pm\text{x}}$N$_y$), we have found a gradual change of color from
dark-blue to pink-violet in the pressure region of about 12 GPa to 21 GPa. The
temperature dependence of resistivity under pressures up to 50.5 GPa shows
progressively optimized metallic behavior with pressure. Interestingly, in the
pressure region for the color change, a clear decrease of resistivity is
observed with the increase of pressure, which is accompanied by a clear
increase of the residual resistivity ratio (RRR). Fitting to the low
temperature resistivity gives exponents of about 2, suggesting a Fermi liquid
behavior in low temperature region. The general behavior in wide temperature
region suggests that the electron-phonon scattering is still the dominant one.
The magnetoresistance up to 9 tesla in the state under a pressure of 50.5 GPa
shows an almost negligible effect, which suggests that the electric conduction
in the pink-violet state is dominated by a single band. It is highly desired to
have theoretical efforts in understanding the evolution of color and
resistivity in this interesting system.

<br>

Competing short- and long-range interactions represent distinguished
ingredients for the formation of complex quantum many-body phases. In this
regard, Rydberg atoms are promising as their excited manifold of states have
both density-density and exchange interactions whose strength and range can
vary considerably. Focusing on one-dimensional systems, we leverage the van der
Waals and dipole-dipole interactions of the Rydberg atoms to obtain the
zero-temperature phase diagram for a uniform chain and a dimer model. For the
uniform chain, we can influence the boundaries between ordered phases and
Luttinger liquid while for the dimerized case, a new type of
bond-order-density-wave phase is identified, all of which highlights the
versatility of the Rydberg platform in studying physics involving short- and
long-ranged interactions simultaneously.

<br>
<br>
A theoretical investigation of weak-anchoring effects in a thin
two-dimensional pinned static ridge of nematic liquid crystal resting on a flat
solid substrate in an atmosphere of passive gas is performed. Specifically, we
solve a reduced version of the general system of governing equations recently
derived by Cousins et al. [Proc. Roy. Soc. A}, 478(2259):20210849, 2022] valid
for a symmetric thin ridge under the one-constant approximation of the
Frank--Oseen bulk elastic energy with pinned contact lines to determine the
shape of the ridge and the behaviour of the director within it. Numerical
investigations covering a wide range of parameter values indicate that the
energetically-preferred solutions can be classified in terms of the
Jenkins--Barratt--Barbero--Barberi critical thickness into five qualitatively
different types of solution. In particular, the theoretical results suggest
that anchoring breaking occurs close to the contact lines. The theoretical
predictions are supported by the results of physical experiments for a ridge of
the nematic 4'-pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5CB). In particular, these
experiments show that the homeotropic anchoring at the gas--nematic interface
is broken close to the contact lines by the stronger rubbed planar anchoring at
the nematic--substrate interface. A comparison between the experimental values
of and the theoretical predictions for the effective refractive index of the
ridge gives a first estimate of the anchoring strength of an interface between
air and 5CB to be $(9.80\pm1.12)\times10^{-6}\,{\rm N m}^{-1}$ at a temperature
of $(22\pm1.5)^\circ$C.

<br>
The recent detection of the singular diamagnetism of Dirac electrons in a
single graphene layer paved a new way of probing 2D quantum materials through
the measurement of equilibrium orbital currents which cannot be accessed in
usual transport experiments. Among the theoretical predictions is an intriguing
orbital paramagnetism at saddle points of the dispersion relation. Here we
present magnetisation measurements in graphene monolayers aligned on hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN)crystals. Beside the sharp diamagnetic McClure response at
the Dirac point, we detect extra diamagnetic singularities at the satellite
Dirac points (sDP) of the moir\'e lattice. Surrounding these diamagnetic
satellite peaks, we also observe paramagnetic peaks located at the chemical
potential of the saddle points of the Graphene moir\'e band structure and
relate them to the presence of van Hove logarithmic singularities in the
density of states. These findings reveal the long ago predicted anomalous
paramagnetic orbital response in 2D systems when the Fermi energy is tuned to
the vicinity of saddle points.

<br>

<br>
<br>
The superconducting state and mechanism are among the least understood
phenomena in twisted graphene systems. For instance, recent tunneling
experiments indicate a transition between nodal and gapped pairing with
electron filling, which is not naturally understood within current theory. We
demonstrate that the coexistence of superconductivity and flavor polarization
leads to pairing channels that are guaranteed by symmetry to be entirely
band-off-diagonal, with a variety of unusual consequences: most notably, the
pairing invariant under all symmetries can have protected nodal lines or be
fully gapped, depending on parameters, and the band-off-diagonal chiral d-wave
state exhibits transitions between gapped and nodal regions upon varying the
chemical potential. We demonstrate that nodal band-off-diagonal pairing can be
the leading state when only phonons are considered, and is also uniquely
favored by fluctuations of a time-reversal-symmetric intervalley-coherent order
motivated by recent experiments. Consequently, band-off-diagonal
superconductivity allows for the reconciliation of several key experimental
observations in graphene moir\'e systems.

<br>
We investigate the entanglement between the spins of two quantum dots that
are not connected at once to the same system. Quantum entanglement between
localized spins is an essential property for the development of quantum
computing and quantum information. It is for this reason that generating and
controlling an entangled state between quantum dots received great attention in
the later years.
In this work, we show that the information on the spin orientation of a
quantum dot can be kept, using the Kondo entanglement, in a reservoir of
electrons. Then, this information can be transmitted to another dot after the
first dot has been uncoupled from the reservoirs. We use a double quantum dot
system in a parallel geometry to construct the initial state, where each dot
interacts with reservoirs of different symmetries. We chose a phase in the
couplings to induce an antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the dots. The
time evolution of the initial state has been analyzed using the time-dependent
density matrix renormalization group method.
We found that a partially entangled state between the dots can be obtained,
even if they are not connected at the same time. This entangled state is formed
just during the transient and is destroyed in the stationary state. The
stability of the state found in the transient is shown. To understand the
details of these phenomena, a canonical transformation of the real space is
used.

In recent years, silicene, germanene, and stanene have received considerable
attention due to their possibilities to show a spin Hall effect. Nanoribbons
made of these materials are expected to have topologically protected states.
In this work, we study the electronic properties of nanotubes made of Si, Ge,
Sn, and functionalized Sn. The main difference between these materials and
graphene is the relevance of spin-orbit interaction. The lack of edge states in
a seamless tube eliminates the possibility to find a topological edge state.
The spin-orbit interaction breaks the degeneracy of Dirac's cones and
eliminates the chances of finding a metal nanotube. As a consequence, this
transforms all nanotubes with spin-orbit interaction in trivial band
insulators.
We focus our attention on two features. First, we study the energy band gap
as a function of the diameter of the nanotubes. Then, we concentrate on
controlling the band gap of a nanotube by applying an external radial electric
field.

Uncovering the physical contents of the nontrivial topology of quantum states
is a critical problem in condensed matter physics. Here, we study the
topological circular dichroism in chiral semimetals using linear response
theory and first-principles calculations. We show that topological circular
dichroism is forbidden for Weyl fermions, and thus is unique to chiral
multifold fermions. This is a result of the selection rule that is imposed by
the emergent symmetry under the combination of particle-hole conjugation and
spatial inversion. We discuss a photogalvanic mechanism through this
topological circular dichroism combined with the quantized circular
photogalvanic effect. Finally, using first-principles calculations, we predict
that topological circular dichroism occurs in CoSi for photon energy below
about 0.2 eV. Our work demonstrates the existence of a response property of
unconventional fermions that is fundamentally different from the response of
Dirac and Weyl fermions, motivating further study to uncover other unique
responses.

We study the transition from integrability to chaos for the three-particle
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam- Tsingou (FPUT) model. We can show that both the quartic
b-FPUT model ($\alpha$ = 0) and the cubic one ($\beta$ = 0) are integrable by
introducing an appropriate Fourier representation to express the nonlinear
terms of the Hamiltonian. For generic values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the model
is non-integrable and displays a mixed phase space with both chaotic and
regular trajectories. In the classical case, chaos is diagnosed by the
investigation of Poincar\'e sections. In the quantum case, the level spacing
statistics in the energy basis belongs to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble in
the chaotic regime, and crosses over to Poissonian behavior in the
quasi-integrable low-energy limit. In the chaotic part of the spectrum, two
generic observables obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.

The recent report of near-ambient superconductivity in nitrogen doped
lutetium hydride1 has triggered a worldwide fanaticism and raised major
questions about the latest claims. An intriguing phenomenon of color changes in
pressurized samples from blue to pink to red was observed and correlated with
the claimed superconducting transition, but the origin and underlying physics
of these color changes have yet to be elucidated2-7. Here we report synthesis
and characterization of high-purity nitrogen doped lutetium hydride
LuH_{2\pm\text{x}}N_y with the same structure and composition as in the main
phase of near-ambient superconductor1. We find a new purple phase of
LuH_{2\pm\text{x}}N_y between blue and pink phase, and reveal that the sample
color changes likely stem from pressure-driven redistribution of nitrogen and
its interaction with the LuH2 framework. No superconducting transition is found
in all blue, purple, pink and red phases at temperatures 1.8-300 K and
pressures 0-30 GPa. Instead, we identify a notable temperature-induced
resistance anomaly of structural and/or electronic origin in
LuH_{2\pm\text{x}}N_y, which is most pronounced in the pink phase and may have
been erroneously interpreted as a sign of superconducting transition. This work
establishes key benchmarks for nitrogen doped lutetium hydrides, allowing an
in-depth understanding of the novel pressure-induced phase changes.

<h3>The fate of entanglement in ferro- and antiferro-magnets under  Lindbladian or non-Markovian dynamics and possible transition to  Landau-Lifshitz classical dynamics</h3>

It is commonly assumed in spintronics and magnonics that localized spins
within antiferromagnetic materials are in the N\'{e}el ground state (GS), as
well as that such state evolves, when pushed out of equilibrium by current or
external fields, according to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation
viewing localized spins as classical vectors of fixed length. On the other
hand, the true GS of antiferromagnets is highly entangled, as confirmed by very
recent neutron scattering experiments witnessing their entanglement. Although
GS of ferromagnets is always unentangled, their magnonic low-energy excitation
are superpositions of many-body spin states and, therefore, entangled. In this
study, we initialize quantum Heisenberg ferro- or antiferro-magnetic chains
hosing localized spins $S=1/2$ or $S=5/2$ into unentangled pure state and then
evolve them by quantum master equations (QMEs) of Lindblad or non-Markovian
type, derived by coupling localized spins to a bosonic bath or by using
additional ``reaction coordinate'' in the latter case. The time evolution is
initiated by applying an external magnetic field, and entanglement of thereby
generated {\em mixed} quantum states is monitored by computing its logarithmic
negativity. We find that non-Markovian dynamics maintains some degree of
entanglement, which shrinks the length of the vector of spin expectation values
thereby making the LLG equation inapplicable. Conversly, Lindbladian (i.e.,
Markovian) dynamics ensures that entanglement quickly goes to zero, thereby
enabling quantum-to-classical-LLG transition in all cases (i.e., $S=1/2$ or
