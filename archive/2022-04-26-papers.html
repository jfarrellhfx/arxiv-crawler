<h3>Charge order from the local Coulomb repulsion in undoped infinite-layer nickelates</h3>

Competition between superconductivity and other various ordered states plays
a central role in correlated electron materials. The charge order with
translational symmetry breaking has been observed in the parent compounds of
nickelate superconductors with a wave vector
$\mathbf{q}\simeq\left(\frac{1}{3},0,0\right)$. Here we combine
density-functional-theory and dynamical-mean-field-theory to study undoped
NdNiO$_2$, and find that the charge ordered state with a periodic
Ni$^{1+}$-Ni$^{2+}$-Ni$^{1+}$ pattern can have a lower energy than the
paramagnetic state and the checkerboard antiferromagnetic state for the strong
local Coulomb repulsion on the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Its spectral function
evidently shows that the Ni$^{2+}$-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital forms a hole-singlet
due to the electron transfer to the interstitial-$s$/Nd-$d$ conduction bands,
while the Ni$^{1+}$-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital exhibits a sharp quasiparticle
resonance near the Fermi energy inside the Mott Hubbard gap. The charge order
can be controlled by the charge transfer energy between Ni-$d$ and
interstitial-$s$/Nd-$d$ orbitals, and there is a delicate competition between
the kinetic energy cost and the potential energy gain, compared to the
checkboard antiferromagnetic state. Our results provide a pure electronic
explanation of the charge order observed experimentally and reveal some
distinctive properties of the infinite-layer nickelates.

<h3>Monopole Josephson Effects in a Dirac Spin Liquid</h3>

Dirac Spin liquids (DSLs) are gapless featureless states, yet interesting by
virtue of the effective field theory describing them -- (2+1)-dimensional
quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$). Further, a DSL is known to be a "parent
state" of various seemingly unrelated ordered states, such as antiferromagnets
and valence bond solids in the sense that one can obtain ordered states by
condensing magnetic monopoles of the emergent gauge field. Can operators in the
effective field theory, such as the emergent electric field, be externally
induced and measured? In this work, we exploit the parent state picture to
argue that the answer is yes. We propose a range of "monopole Josephson
effects" that arise when two ordered states are separated by a region of the
parent DSL. In particular, we show that one can induce an AC monopole Josephson
effect, which manifests itself as an AC emergent electric field in the spin
liquid, accompanied by a measurable spin current. Further, we show that this AC
emergent electric field can be measured as a sharp tunable peak in Raman
scattering. This work provides a theoretical proof of principle that emergent
gauge fields in spin liquids can be externally induced, manipulated, and probed
using more conventional states, which offers a generic platform for studying
the exotic spin phases.

<h3>Quasiparticle interference as a direct experimental probe of bulk odd-frequency superconducting pairing</h3>

We show that the quasiparticle interference (QPI) probed by Fourier transform
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy acts as a direct experimental
probe of bulk odd-frequency superconducting pairing. Taking the example of a
conventional $s$-wave superconductor under applied magnetic field, we show that
the nature of the QPI peaks can only be characterized by including the
odd-frequency pairing correlations generated in this system. In particular, we
identify that the defining feature of odd-frequency pairing gives rise to a
bias asymmetry in the QPI, thus present generically in materials with
odd-frequency pairing.

<h3>Scattering phenomena for spin transport in Kitaev spin liquid</h3>

The Kitaev model exhibits a canonical quantum spin liquid as a ground state
and hosts two fractional quasiparticles, itinerant Majorana fermion and
localized flux excitation. The former can carry heat and spin modulations in
the quantum spin liquid, but the role of the latter remains unknown for the
transport phenomena. Here, we focus on spin transport in the presence of
excited fluxes and report that they yield strong interference in the
propagation of the Majorana fermions, which feel gauge-like potential emergent
around the fluxes. We examine the transient spin dynamics triggered by a pulsed
magnetic field at an edge. In the absence of excited fluxes, the magnetic-field
pulse creates the plane wave of the Majorana fermions, which flows in the
quantum spin liquid. Although this wave does not accompany the change of local
spin moments in bulk, it induces local moments at the side opposite to the edge
under the magnetic-field pulse. We observe the spatial modulation of induced
spin moments when fluxes are excited in the bulk region. This behavior is more
striking than the case of lattice defects. Moreover, we find that, although the
amplitude of the spatial change is almost independent of the distance between
lattice defects, it is strongly enhanced by increasing the distance for the
case of excited fluxes. The difference is understood from the influence on the
itinerant Majorana fermions; the lattice defects change the system locally, but
flux excitations alter all the transfer integrals on the string connecting
them. The present results will provide another route to observing intrinsic
flux excitations distinguished from extrinsic effects such as lattice defects.
