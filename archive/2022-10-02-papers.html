<h3>A model of membrane deformations driven by a surface pH gradient</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15080</a>

Many cellular organelles are membrane-bound structures with complex membrane
composition and shape. Their shapes have been observed to depend on the
metabolic state of the organelle, and the mechanisms that couple biochemical
pathways and membrane shape are still actively investigated. Here, we study a
model coupling inhomogeneities in the lipid composition and membrane geometry
via a generalized Helfrich free energy. We derive the resulting stress tensor,
the Green's function for a tubular membrane and compute the phase diagram of
the induced deformations. We then apply this model to study the deformation of
mitochondria cristae described as membrane tubes supporting a pH gradient at
its surface. This gradient in turn controls the lipid composition of the
membrane via the protonation/deprotonation of cardiolipins, which are
acid-based lipids known to be crucial for mitochondria shape and functioning.
Our model predicts the appearance of tube deformations resembling the observed
shape changes of cristea when submitted to a proton gradient.

<h3>Low Thermal Conductivity Phase Change Memory Superlattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15227</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Ning, Xilin Zhou, Yunzheng Wang, Takashi Yagi, Janne Kalikka, Siew Lang Teo, Zhitang Song, Michel Bosman, Robert E. Simpson</i>
<br>
Phase change memory devices are typically reset by melt-quenching a material
to radically lower its electrical conductance. The high power and concomitantly
high current density required to reset phase change materials is the major
issue that limits the access times of 3D phase change memory architectures.
Phase change superlattices were developed to lower the reset energy by
confining the phase transition to the interface between two different phase
change materials. However, the high thermal conductivity of the superlattices
means that heat is poorly confined within the phase change material, and most
of the thermal energy is wasted to the surrounding materials. Here, we
identified Ti as a useful dopant for substantially lowering the thermal
conductivity of Sb2Te3-GeTe superlattices whilst also stabilising the layered
structure from unwanted disordering. We demonstrate via laser heating that
lowering the thermal conductivity by doping the Sb2Te3 layers with Ti halves
the switching energy compared to superlattices that only use interfacial phase
change transitions and strain engineering. The thermally optimized superlattice
has (0 0 l) crystallographic orientation yet a thermal conductivity of just
0.25 W/m.K in the "on" (set) state. Prototype phase change memory devices that
incorporate this Ti-doped superlattice switch faster and and at a substantially
lower voltage than the undoped superlattice. During switching the Ti-doped
Sb2Te3 layers remain stable within the superlattice and only the Ge atoms are
active and undergo interfacial phase transitions. In conclusion, we show the
potential of thermally optimised Sb2Te3-GeTe superlattices for a new generation
of energy-efficient electrical and optical phase change memory.

<h3>Advanced interfacial phase change material: structurally confined and  interfacially extended superlattice</h3>

<br>
Interfacial Phase Change Memory (iPCM) retrench unnecessary power consumption
due to wasted heat generated during phase change by reducing unnecessary
entropic loss. In this study, an advanced iPCM (GeTe/Ti-Sb2Te3 Superlattice) is
synthesized by doping Ti into Sb2Te3. Structural analysis and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that bonding distortion and
structurally well-confined layers contribute to improve phase change properties
in iPCM. Ti-Sb2Te3 acts as an effective thermal barrier to localize the
generated heat inside active region, which leads to reduction of switching
energy. Since Ge-Te bonds adjacent to short and strong Ti-Te bonds are more
elongated than the bonds near Sb-Te, it is easier for Ge atoms to break the
bond with Te due to strengthened Peierls distortions (Rlong/Rshort) during
phase change process. Properties of advanced iPCM (cycling endurance, write
speed/energy) exceed previous records. Moreover, well-confined multi-level
states are obtained with advanced iPCM, showing potential as a neuromorphic
memory. Our work paves the way for designing superlattice based PCM by
controlling confinement layers.

<h3>Helium-bearing superconductor at high pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15241" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15241</a>
<br>
<i>Jingyu Hou, Xiao Dong, Artem R. Oganov, Xiao-Ji Weng, Chun-Mei Hao, Guochun Yang, Hui-Tian Wang, Xiang-Feng Zhou, Yongjun Tian</i>
<br>
Helium (He) is the most inert noble gas at ambient conditions. It adopts a
hexagonal close packed structure (P63/mmc) and remains in the insulating phase
up to 32 TPa. In contrast, lithium (Li) is one of the most reactive metals at
zero pressure, while its cubic high-pressure phase (Fd-3m) is a weak metallic
electride above 475 GPa. Strikingly, a stable compound of Li5He2 (R-3m) was
formed by mixing Fd-3m Li with P63/mmc He above 700 GPa. The presence of helium
promotes the lattice transformation from Fd-3m Li to Pm-3m Li, and tuns the
three-dimensional distributed interstitial electrons into the mixture of zero-
and two-dimensional anionic electrons. This significantly increases the degree
of metallization at the Fermi level, consequently, the coupling of conductive
anionic electrons with the Li-dominated vibrations is the key factor to the
formation of superconducting electride Li5He2 with a transition temperature up
to 26 K, dynamically stable to pressures down to 210 GPa.

<h3>Onsager's variational principle for nonreciprocal systems with odd  elasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15363</a>
<br>
<i>Li-Shing Lin, Kento Yasuda, Kenta Ishimoto, Yuto Hosaka, Shigeyuki Komura</i>
<br>
Using Onsager's variational principle, we derive dynamical equations for a
nonequilibrium active system with odd elasticity. The elimination of the extra
variable that is coupled to the nonequilibrium driving force leads to the
nonreciprocal set of equations for the material coordinates. The obtained
nonreciprocal equations manifest the physical origin of the odd elastic
constants that are proportional to the nonequilibrium force and the friction
coefficients. Our approach offers a systematic and consistent way to derive
nonreciprocal equations for active matter in which the time-reversal symmetry
is broken.

<h3>Tangentially Driven Active Polar Linear Polymers -- An Analytical Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15364" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15364</a>
<br>
<i>Christian A. Philipps, Gerhard Gompper, Roland G. Winkler</i>
<br>
The conformational and dynamical properties of isolated flexible active polar
linear polymers (APLPs) are studied analytically. The APLPs are modeled as
Gaussian bead-spring linear chains augmented by tangential active forces, both
in a discrete and continuous representations. The polar forces lead to linear
non-Hermitian equations of motion, which are solved by an eigenfunction
expansion in terms of a biorthogonal basis set. Our calculations show that the
polymer conformations are independent of activity. On the contrary, tangential
propulsion strongly impacts the polymer dynamics and yields an active ballistic
regime as well as activity-enhanced long-time diffusion, regimes which are both
absent in passive systems. The polar forces imply a coupling of modes in the
eigenfunction representation, in particular with the translational mode, with a
respective strong influence on the polymer dynamics. The total polymer
mean-square displacement on scales smaller than their radius of gyration is
determined by the active internal dynamics rather than the collective
center-of-mass motion, in contrast to active Brownian polymers, reflecting the
distinct difference in the propulsion mechanism.

<h3>A New Group of Two-Dimensional Non-van der Waals Materials with Ultra  Low Exfoliation Energies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15485" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15485</a>
<br>
<i>Tom Barnowsky, Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Rico Friedrich</i>
<br>
The exfoliation energy - quantifying the energy required to extract a
two-dimensional (2D) sheet from the surface of a bulk material - is a key
parameter determining the synthesizability of 2D compounds. Here, using ab
initio calculations, we present a new group of non-van der Waals 2D materials
derived from non-layered crystals which exhibit ultra low exfoliation energies.
In particular for sulfides, surface relaxations are essential to correctly
describe the associated energy gain needed to obtain reliable results. Taking
into account long-range dispersive interactions has only a minor effect on the
energetics and ultimately proves that the exfoliation energies are close to the
ones of traditional van der Waals bound 2D compounds. The candidates with the
lowest energies, 2D SbTlO$_3$ and MnNaCl$_3$, exhibit appealing electronic,
potential topological, and magnetic features as evident from the calculated
band structures making these systems an attractive platform for fundamental and
applied nanoscience.

<h3>Vortexability: A Unifying Criterion for Ideal Fractional Chern  Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15023" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15023</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick J. Ledwith, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker</i>
<br>
Fractional Chern insulators realize the remarkable physics of the fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in crystalline systems with Chern bands. The lowest
Landau level (LLL) is known to host the FQHE, but not all Chern bands are
suitable for realizing fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Previous approaches
to stabilizing FCIs focused on mimicking the LLL through momentum space
criteria. Here instead we take a real-space perspective by introducing the
notion of vortexability. Vortexable Chern bands admit a fixed operator that
introduces vortices into any band wavefunction while keeping the state entirely
within the same band. Vortexable bands admit trial wavefunctions for FCI
states, akin to Laughlin states. In the absence of dispersion and for
sufficiently short ranged interactions, these FCI states are the ground state
-- independent of the distribution of Berry curvature. Vortexable bands are
much more general than the LLL, and we showcase a recipe for constructing them.
We exhibit diverse examples in graphene-based systems with or without magnetic
field, and with any Chern number. A special class of vortexable bands is shown
to be equivalent to the momentum space ``trace condition" or ``ideal band
condition". In addition, we also identify a more general form of vortexability
that goes beyond this criterion. We introduce a modified measure that
quantifies deviations from general vortexability which can be applied to
generic Chern bands to identify promising FCI platforms.

<h3>In-situ exfoliation method of large-area 2D materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15030</a>
<br>
<i>Antonija Grubišić-Čabo, Matteo Michiardi, Charlotte E. Sanders, Marco Bianchi, Davide Curcio, Dibya Phuyal, Magnus H. Berntsen, Qinda Guo, Maciej Dendzik</i>
<br>
The success in studying 2D materials inherently relies on producing samples
of large area, and high quality enough for the experimental conditions. Because
their 2D nature surface sensitive techniques such as photoemission spectroscopy
, tunneling microscopy and electron diffraction, that work in ultra high vacuum
(UHV) environment are prime techniques that have been employed with great
success in unveiling new properties of 2D materials but it requires samples to
be free of adsorbates. The technique that most easily and readily yields
2dmaterials of highest quality is indubitably mechanical exfoliation from bulk
grown samples, however as this technique is traditionally done in dedicated
environment, the transfer of these samples into UHV setups requires some form
of surface cleaning that tempers with the sample quality. In this article, we
report on a simple and general method of \textit{in-situ} mechanical
exfoliation directly in UHV that yields large-area single-layered films. By
employing standard UHV cleaning techniques and by purpusedly exploiting the
chemical affinity between the substrate and the sample we could yield large
area exfoliation of transition metal dichalcogenides. Multiple transition metal
dichalcogenides, both metallic and semiconducting, are exfoliated
\textit{in-situ} onto Au and Ag, and Ge. Exfoliated flakes are found to be
sub-milimeter size with excellent crystallinity and purity, as evidenced by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and
low-energy electron diffraction. In addition, we demonstrate exfoliation of
air-sensitive 2D materials and possibility of controlling the substrate-2D
material twist angle.

<h3>Surprising impact of random impurities on the anomalous Hall effect in  chiral superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15057</a>
<br>
<i>Hao-Tian Liu, Weipeng Chen, Wen Huang</i>
<br>
The anomalous Hall effect and the closely related polar Kerr effect are
arguably the most direct evidence of chiral superconducting pairing. However,
disorder or multiband pairing is typically needed for these effects to
manifest, as the anomalous Hall conductivity vanishes in clean single-band
chiral superconductors. Bearing in mind the candidate chiral superconductor
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study the impact of disorder on the Hall response, through
real-space simulations of both single-band and two-band chiral superconductors
with random impurities. In single-band calculations, we highlight some
important differences from the conclusions obtained in previous
skew-scattering-type diagramatic analyses. In two-band models, the intrinsic
Hall conductivity arising from interband optical transitions are, quite
unexpectedly, greatly suppressed by impurity scattering. The suppression stems
from the restrictive momentum-space distribution of the corresponding
current-current correlator. In addition, we check that random impurities do not
induce anomalous Hall effect in non-chiral TRSB superconducting states the
likes of $s+i d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+i g_{xy(x^2-y^2)}$. The
implications for Kerr effect measurements will be briefly remarked upon.

<h3>Semiclassical bounds on dynamics of two-dimensional interacting  disordered fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15062" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15062</a>
<br>
<i>Łukasz Iwanek, Marcin Mierzejewski, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Dries Sels, Adam S. Sajna</i>
<br>
Using the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) we study quench dynamics of
two-dimensional lattice systems consisting of interacting spinless fermions
with potential disorder. First, we demonstrate that the semiclassical dynamics
generally relaxes faster than the full quantum dynamics. We obtain this result
by comparing the semiclassical dynamics with exact diagonalization and Lanczos
propagation of one-dimensional chains. Next, exploiting the TWA capabilities of
simulating large lattices, we investigate how the relaxation rates depend on
the dimensionality of the studied system. We show that strongly disordered
one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems exhibit a transient,
logarithmic-in-time relaxation, which was recently established for
one-dimensional chains. Such relaxation corresponds to the infamous $1/f$-noise
at strong disorder.

<h3>Intrinsic Noise of the Single Electron Box</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15086" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15086</a>
<br>
<i>Laurence Cochrane, Ashwin A. Seshia, M. Fernando Gonzalez Zalba</i>
<br>
We quantify the intrinsic noise of the Single Electron Box arising from
stochastic cyclic electron tunnelling between a quantum dot and a resevoir
driven by a periodic gate voltage. We use both a master equation formalism and
Markov Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the gate noise current, and find it
to be generated by a cyclostationary process which displays significant
spectral correlations at large excitation amplitudes and high tunnel rates. We
model noise filtering through an electrical resonator and detection via
synchronous demodulation to evaluate the effective noise spectral density in
rf-reflectometry qubit readout applications, and determine the conditions under
which the intrinsic noise limit could be measured experimentally. Our results
have implications in the ultimate sensitivity of SEBs for fast, high-fidelity
readout of spin qubits.

<h3>Investigation of the effect of Au2O3 dopant on elastic properties of  PbO-B2O3-SeO2: Er2O3 glass ceramics by ultrasonic techniques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15088</a>
<br>
<i>A.Siva Sesha Reddy, A.V.Kityk, J.Jedryka, P.Rakus, A.Wojciechowski, N.Venkatramaiah, V.Ravi Kumar, N.Veeraiah</i>
<br>
Various elastic coefficients of Au2O3 doped PbO-B2O3-SeO2:Er2O3 (PBSE) glass
ceramics were evaluated as functions of Au2O3 content using ultrasonic velocity
measurements. The elastic coefficients and micro-hardness showed a decreasing
tendency with the concentration of Au2O3. Such decrease is attributed to the
increasing concentration of gold metallic particles and [SeO3]2- groups that
acted as modifiers and induced imperfections in these samples. Obtained results
were observed to be consistent with the conclusions drawn from spectroscopic
studies that include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared (IR),
photoluminescence (PL) and positron annihilation (PAL) spectroscopy studies.
Overall, these studies have revealed that even though, the presence of gold
metallic particles is preferable for achieving superior luminescence and
electrical properties, presence of such particles caused to decrease the
elastic coefficients and micro-hardness of these glass ceramics. However, when
the concentration of Au2O3 is increased beyond 0.075 mol%, we have observed a
slight increase of elastic coefficients and micro-hardness.

We show that adding ethylenediamine (EDA) to perovskite precursor solution

high-bromide-content, methylammonium-free, formamidinium cesium lead halide
perovskites FA1-xCsxPb(I1-yBry)3 which are currently of interest for
perovskite-on-Si tandem solar cells. Using spectroscopy and hyperspectral
microscopy, we show that the additive improves film homogeneity and suppresses
the phase instability that is ubiquitous in high-Br perovskite formulations,
producing films that remain stable for over 100 days in ambient conditions.
With the addition of 1 mol% EDA we demonstrate 1.69 eV-gap perovskite
single-junction p-i-n devices with a VOC of 1.22 V, and a champion maximum
power point tracked power conversion efficiency of 18.8%, comparable to the
best reported methylammonium-free perovskites. Using nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques, we show that EDA reacts
with FA+ in solution, rapidly and quantitatively forming imidazolinium cations.
It is the presence of imidazolinium during crystallization which drives the
improved perovskite thin-film properties.

<br>
We visualized negative refraction of phonon-polaritons in hetero-bicrystals
of two hyperbolic van der Waals materials: molybdenum oxide ($MoO_3$) and
isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride ($h^{11}BN$). The polaritons -
hybrids of infrared photons and lattice vibrations - form collimated rays that
display negative refraction when passing through a planar interface between the
$h^{11}BN$ and $MoO_3$ crystals. At a special frequency $\omega_0$, these rays
can circulate along closed diamond-shaped trajectories. We show that polariton
eigenmodes display regions of both positive and negative dispersion interrupted
by multiple gaps resulting from polaritonic level repulsion.

The quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a topologically protected phenomenon which
has been observed in various systems. In experiments, the size of Hall bar
device to realize the QHE is generally much larger than the phase coherence
length, in which the quantum coherence of electrons is destroyed. Here, we
theoretically study the influence of dephasing effect on the quantized Hall
(QH) plateaus. We find that the QH plateau disappears in perfectly quantum
coherent systems if the coupling between leads and central region is imperfect.
The Hall resistance is very large and strongly oscillates instead of presenting
the QH plateau in this case. However, by introducing the dephasing, the Hall
resistance decreases and the QH plateau appears gradually. Similar results can
also be observed for the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Our results propose
that dephasing effect promotes the appearance of QH plateaus, which opens a new
topic of the dephasing effect on topological systems.

<h3>Perspectives on Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</h3>

<br>
Although the development of spintronic devices has advanced significantly
over the past decade with the use of ferromagnetic materials, the extensive
implementation of such devices has been limited by the notable drawbacks of
these materials. Antiferromagnets claim to resolve many of these shortcomings
leading to faster, smaller, more energy-efficient, and more robust electronics.
Antiferromagnets exhibit many desirable properties including zero net
magnetization, imperviousness to external magnetic fields, intrinsic
high-frequency dynamics with a characteristic precession frequency on the order
of terahertz (THz), and the ability to serve as passive exchange-bias materials
in multiple magnetoresistance (MR)- based devices. In this Perspective article,
we will discuss the fundamental physics of magnetic structures in
antiferromagnets and their interactions with external stimuli such as spin
current, voltage, and magnons. A discussion on the challenges lying ahead is
also provided along with an outlook of future research directions of these
systems.

<h3>Quantum quenches in a pseudo-Hermitian Chern insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Peng He, Yan-Qing Zhu, Jian-Te Wang, Shi-Liang Zhu</i>
<br>
We propose to uncover the topology of a pseudo-Hermitian Chern insulator by
quantum quench dynamics. The Bloch Hamiltonian of the pseudo-Hermitian Chern
insulator is defined in the basis of the q-deformed Pauli matrices, which are
related to the representation of the deformed algebras. We show the
bulk-surface duality of the pseudo-Hermitian phases, then further build a
concrete relation between the static band topology and quench dynamics, in
terms of the time-averaged spin textures. The results are also generalized into
a fully nonequilibrium case where the post quench evolution is governed by a
Floquet pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we propose a possible scheme
to realize the seemingly challenging model in a bilayer lattice and detect the
dynamics with a double-quench protocol.

Strong correlation in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems drastically
changes their dynamic and transport properties in the presence of the
interaction. In this letter, combining quantum integrable theory with numerics,
we exactly compute the spectral function of 1D Lieb-Liniger gas at a many-body
level of large scales. It turns out that a full capture of the power-law
singularities in the vicinities of thresholds requires system size as large as
thousands of particles. Our research essentially confirms the validity of the
nonlinear Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and provides a reliable technique for
studying critical behaviour emerged only in thermodynamic limit.

<br>
Arsenic doping in silicides has been much less studied compared with
phosphorus. In this study, superconductivity is successfully induced by As
doping in Mo$_5$Si$_3$. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$)
reaches 7.7 K, which is higher than those in previously known W$_5$Si$_3$-type
superconductors. Mo$_5$Si$_2$As is a type-II BCS superconductor with upper and
lower critical fields of 6.65 T and 22.4 mT, respectively. In addition, As
atoms are found to selectively take the 8$h$ sites in Mo$_5$Si$_2$As. The
emergence of superconductivity is possibly due to the shift of Fermi level as a
consequence of As doping, as revealed by the specific heat measurements and
first-principles calculations. Our work provides not only another example of As
doping, but also a practical strategy to achieve superconductivity in silicides
through Fermi level engineering.

<h3>Coexisting structural disorder and robust spin-polarization in  half-metallic FeMnVAl</h3>

<br>
Half-metallic ferromagnets (HMF) are on one of the most promising materials
in the field of spintronics due to their unique band structure consisting of
one spin sub-band having metallic characteristics along with another sub-band
with semiconductor-like behavior. In this work, we report the synthesis of a
novel quaternary Heusler alloy FeMnVAl and have studied the structural,
magnetic, transport, and electronic properties complemented with
first-principles calculations. Among different possible structurally ordered
arrangements, the optimal structure is identified by theoretical energy
minimization. The corresponding spin-polarized band structure calculations
indicates the presence of a half-metallic ferromagnetic ground state. A
detailed and careful investigation of the x-ray diffraction data, M\"{o}ssbauer
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra suggest the presence of site-disorder
between the Fe and Mn atoms in the stable ordered structure of the system. The
magnetic susceptibility measurement clearly establishes a ferromagnetic-like
transition below $\sim$213 K. The ${^{57}}$Fe M\"{o}ssbauer spectrometry
measurements suggest only the Mn-spins could be responsible for the magnetic
order, which is consistent with our theoretical calculation. Surprisingly, the
density-functional-theory calculations reveal that the spin-polarization value
is almost immunized (92.4\% ${\rightarrow}$ 90.4\%) from the Mn-Fe structural
disorder, even when nonmagnetic Fe and moment carrying Mn sites are entangled
inseparably. Robustness of spin polarization and half metallicity in the
studied FeMnVAl compound comprising structural disorder is thus quite
interesting and could provide a new direction to investigate and understand the
exact role of disorders on spin polarization in these class of materials, over
the available knowledge.

Purely quantum electron systems exhibit intriguing correlated electronic
phases by virtue of quantum fluctuations in addition to electron-electron
interactions. To realize such quantum electron systems, a key ingredient is
dense electrons decoupled from other degrees of freedom. Here, we report the
discovery of a pure quantum electron liquid, which spreads up to ~ 3 {\AA} in
the vacuum on the surface of electride crystal. An extremely high electron
density and its weak hybridisation with buried atomic orbitals evidence the
quantum and pure nature of electrons, that exhibit a polarized liquid phase as
demonstrated by our spin-dependent measurement. Further, upon enhancing the
electron correlation strength, the dynamics of quantum electrons changes to
that of non-Fermi liquid along with an anomalous band deformation, suggestive
of a transition to a hexatic liquid crystal phase. Our findings cultivate the
frontier of quantum electron systems, and serve as a platform for exploring
correlated electronic phases in a pure fashion.

<h3>A tabletop Optically Pumped Magnetometer setup for the monitoring of  magnetic nanoparticle clustering and immobilization using Thermal Noise  Magnetometry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15360" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15360</a>
<br>

<br>
Many characterization techniques for magnetic nanoparticles depend on the
usage of external fields. This is not the case in Thermal Noise Magnetometry
(TNM), where thermal fluctuations in the magnetic signal of magnetic
nanoparticle ensembles are measured without any external excitation. This can
provide valuable information about the fundamental dynamical properties of the
particles, due to the purely observative experiments of this relatively new
technique. Until now, TNM signals have been detected only by a superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) sensor. We present a tabletop setup using
Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPMs) in a small magnetic shield, offering a
flexible and accessible alternative and show the agreement between both
measurement systems for two different commercially available nanoparticle
samples. We argue that the OPM setup with high accessibility complements the
SQUID setup with high sensitivity and bandwidth. Furthermore, because of its
excellent sensitivity in the lower frequencies, the OPM tabletop setup is well
suited to monitor aggregation processes where the magnetization dynamics of the
particles tend to slow down, e.g. in biological processes. As a proof of
concept, we show for three different immobilization and clustering processes
the changes in the noise spectrum measured in the tabletop setup: 1) the
aggregation of particles due to the addition of ethanol, 2) the formation of
polymer structures in the sample due to UV exposure, and 3) the cellular uptake
of the particles by THP-1 cells. From our results we conclude that the tabletop
setup offers a flexible and widely adoptable sensor measurement unit to monitor
the immobilization and clustering of magnetic nanoparticles over time for
different applications.

Studies of ferromagnet-superconductor hybrid systems have uncovered magnetic
interactions between the competing electronic orderings. The Electromagnetic
Proximity Effect predicts the formation of a spontaneous vector potential
inside a superconductor placed in proximity to a ferromagnet. In this work, we
use a Nb superconducting layer and Ni ferromagnetic layer to test for such
magnetic interactions. We use the complementary, but independent, techniques of
polarised neutron reflectometry and detection Josephson junctions to probe the
magnetic response inside the superconducting layer at close to zero applied
field. In this condition, Meissner screening is negligible, so our measurements
examine only additional magnetic and screening contributions from proximity
effects. We report that any signals attributable to such proximity effects are
below the detection resolution of our experimental study. We estimate a limit
of the size of the zero field Electromagnetic Proximity Effect in our Ni-Nb
samples to be $\pm$0.27 mT from our measurements.

In this paper, we study Bose-Einstein condensation of Rydberg-dressed atoms
considering finite range interactions. We use Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
approximation based on Mean-Field approach. Moreover, within this approximation
modified by the finite-range character of the two-body interaction we shall
obtain analytical expressions for thermodynamic quantities of Rydberg-dressed
Bose gas. The imaginary part of the quasiparticle spectrum of a BEC signals the
instability of the roton mode with respect to the formation of supersolid
state. Our theory predicts a second-order quantum phase transition from BEC to
supersolid phase for Rydberg-dressed bosons in three dimensions.

Here, we review our progress on a geometrical approach of quantum physics and
topological crystals starting from nature, electrodynamics of planets and
linking with Dirac magnetic monopoles and gauge fields. The Bloch sphere of a
quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle can also acquire an integer topological
charge in the presence of a radial magnetic field. We show that the global
topological properties are revealed from the poles of the surface allowing a
correspondence between smooth fields, metric and quantum distance. The
information is transported from each pole to the equatorial plane on a thin
Dirac string. We develop the theory, "the quantum topometry" in space and time,
and present applications on transport from a Newtonian approach, on a quantized
photo-electric effect from circular dichroism of light towards topological band
structures of crystals. The occurrence of robust edge modes related to the
topological lattice models are revealed analytically when deforming the sphere
or ellipse onto a cylinder. The topological properties of the quantum Hall
effect, the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect on
the honeycomb lattice can be measured locally in the Brillouin zone from the
light-matter coupling. The formalism allows us to include interaction effects
from the momentum space. Interactions may also result in fractional entangled
geometry within the curved space. We develop a relation between entangled
wavefunction in quantum mechanics, coherent superposition of geometries, a way
to one-half topological numbers and Majorana fermions. We show realizations in
topological matter. We present a relation between axion electrodynamics,
topological insulators on a surface of a cube and the two-spheres' model via
the meron.

<h3>Single charge control of localized excitons in heterostructures with  ferroelectric thin films and two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
Single charge control of localized excitons (LXs) in two-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is crucial for potential applications
in quantum information processing and storage. However, traditional
electrostatic doping method with applying metallic gates onto TMDCs may cause
the inhomogeneous charge distribution, optical quench, and energy loss. Here,
by locally controlling the ferroelectric polarization of the ferroelectric thin
film BiFeO3 (BFO) with a scanning probe, we can deterministically manipulate
the doping type of monolayer WSe2 to achieve the p-type and n-type doping. This
nonvolatile approach can maintain the doping type and hold the localized
excitonic charges for a long time without applied voltage. Our work
demonstrated that ferroelectric polarization of BFO can control the charges of
LXs effectively. Neutral and charged LXs have been observed in different
ferroelectric polarization regions, confirmed by magnetic optical measurement.
Highly circular polarization degree about 90 % of the photon emission from
these quantum emitters have been achieved in high magnetic fields. Controlling
single charge of LXs in a non-volatile way shows a great potential for
deterministic photon emission with desired charge states for photonic long-term
memory.

Identifying and removing microplastics (MPs) from the environment is a global
challenge. This study explores how the colloidal fraction of common MPs behave
at aqueous interfaces of liquid crystal (LC) films. We observed polyethylene
(PE) and polystyrene (PS) microparticles to be captured at the LC interface and
exhibit distinct two-dimensional aggregation patterns. The addition of low
concentrations of surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)) was found to further
amplify the differences in PS/PE aggregation patterns, with PS changing from a
linear chain-like morphology to a singly dispersed state with increasing SDS
concentration and PE forming dense clusters at all SDS concentrations.
Statistical characterization of assembly patterns using fractal geometric
theory-based machine learning and a deep learning image recognition model
yielded highly accurate classification of PE vs PS (>99%). Additionally, by
performing feature importance analysis on our deep learning model, dense,
multi-branched assemblies were confirmed to be unique features of PE relative
to PS. To obtain additional insight into the origin of these key features, we
performed microscopic characterization of LC ordering at the microparticle
surfaces. These observations led us to predict that both microparticle types
should generate LC-mediated interactions (due to elastic strain) with a dipolar
symmetry, a prediction consistent with the observed interfacial organization of
PS but not PE. We conclude that the non-equilibrium organization of the PE
microparticles arises from their polycrystalline nature, which leads to rough
particle surfaces and weakened LC elastic interactions and enhanced capillary
forces. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of LC interfaces
for surface-sensitive characterization of colloidal MPs.

<h3>Third-order intrinsic anomalous Hall effect with generalized  semiclassical theory</h3>

<br>
The linear intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (IAHE) and second-order IAHE have
been intensively investigated in time-reversal broken systems. However, as one
of the important members of the nonlinear Hall family, the investigation of
third-order IAHE remains absent due to the lack of an appropriate theoretical
approach, although the third-order extrinsic AHE has been studied within the
framework of first- and second-order semiclassical theory. Herein, we
generalize the semiclassical theory for Bloch electrons under the uniform
electric field up to the third-order using wavepacket method and based on which
we predict that the third-order IAHE can also occur in time-reversal broken
systems. Same as the second-order IAHE, we find the band geometric quantity,
the second-order field-dependent Berry curvature arising from the second-order
field-induced positional shift, plays a pivotal role to observe this effect.
Moreover, with symmetry analysis, we find that the third-order IAHE, as the
leading contribution, is supported by 15 time-reversal broken 3D magnetic point
groups (MPGs), corresponding to a wide class of antiferromagnetic (AFM)
materials. Guided by the symmetry arguments, a two-band model is chosen to
demonstrate the generalized theory. Furthermore, the generalized third-order
semiclassical theory depends only on the properties of Bloch bands, implying
that it can also be employed to explore the IAHE in realistic AFM materials, by
combining with first-principles calculations.

<h3>Bardeen's tunneling theory applied to intraorbital and interorbital  hopping integrals between dopants in silicon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15447</a>
<br>
<i>Michał Gawełczyk, Michał Zieliński</i>
<br>
We utilize Bardeen's tunneling theory to calculate intra- and interorbital
hopping integrals between phosphorus donors in silicon using known orbital wave
functions. While the two-donor problem can be solved directly, the knowledge of
hoppings for various pairs of orbitals is essential for constructing
multi-orbital Hubbard models for chains and arrays of donors. To assure
applicability to long-range potentials, we rederive Bardeen's formula for the
matrix element without assuming non-overlapping potentials. Moreover, we find a
correction to the original expression allowing us to use it at short distances.
We also show that accurate calculation of the lowest donor-pair eigenstates is
possible based on these tunnel couplings, and we characterize the obtained
states. The results are in satisfactory quantitative agreement with those
obtained with the standard H\"uckel tight-binding method. The calculation
relies solely on the wave functions in the barrier region and does not
explicitly involve donor or lattice potentials, which has practical advantages.
We find that neglecting the central correction potential in the standard method
may lead to qualitatively incorrect results, while its explicit inclusion
raises severe numerical problems, as it is contained in a tiny volume. In
contrast, using wave functions obtained with this correction in the proposed
method does not raise such issues. Nominally, the computational cost of the
method is to calculate a double integral along the plane that separates donors.
For donor separation in directions where valley interference leads to
oscillatory behavior, additional averaging over the position of the integration
plane is needed. Despite this, the presented approach offers a competitive
computational cost as compared to the standard one. This work may be regarded
as a benchmark of a promising method for calculating hopping integrals in
lattice models.

<h3>Partitioning of Diluted Anyons Reveals their Braiding Statistics</h3>

<br>
Correlations of partitioned particles carry essential information about their
quantumness. Partitioning full beams of charged particles leads to current
fluctuations, with their autocorrelation (AC, shot noise) revealing the
particle's charge. This is not the case when the partitioned particle beams are
diluted. Bosons or fermions will exhibit particles antibunching (due to their
discreteness). However, when partitioning anyons, such as the quasiparticles in
fractional quantum Hall states (FQH), the AC unveils an essential aspect of
their exchange statistics: their 'braiding phase'. Here, we describe detailed
measurements of partitioning diluted anyonic edge modes of the FQH 1/3-state.
The measured excess AC agrees with our theory of braiding in the 'time-domain'
- with a braiding angle of 2{\theta}=2{\pi}/3 - without any fitting parameters.
Our work offers a relatively straightforward and simple method to observe the
braiding statistics of other exotic states, such as non-abelian states, without
resorting to complex interference experiments.

<br>
From new neutron powder diffraction experiments on the chiral cubic
($P2{_1}3$) magnet manganese germanide MnGe, we analyse all of the possible
crystal symmetry-allowed magnetic superstructures that are determined
successfully from the data. The incommensurate propagation vectors $k$ of the
magnetic structure are found to be aligned with the [100] cubic axes, and
correspond to a magnetic periodicity of about 30 $\r{A}$ at 1.8 K. Several
maximal crystallographic symmetry magnetic structures are found to fit the data
equally well and are presented. These include topologically non-trivial
magnetic hedgehog and "skyrmion" structures in multi-$k$ cubic 3+3 and
orthorhombic 3+2 dimensional magnetic superspace groups respectively, with
either potentially responsible for topological Hall effect [1]. The presence of
microstrain-like peak broadening caused by the transition to the magnetically
ordered state would seem to favour a "skyrmion"-like magnetic structure, though
this does not rule out the cubic magnetic hedgehog structure. We also report on
a new combined mechanochemical and solid-state chemical route to synthesise
MnGe at ambient pressures and moderate temperatures, and compare with samples
obtained by the traditional high pressure synthesis.

<h3>High-field and high-temperature magnetoresistance reveals the  superconducting behaviour of the stacking faults in multilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
In spite of 40 years of experimental studies and several theoretical
proposals, an overall interpretation of the complex behavior of the
magnetoresistance (MR) of multilayer graphene, i.e. graphite, at high fields
($B \lesssim 70~$T) and in a broad temperature range is still lacking. Part of
the complexity is due to the contribution of stacking faults (SFs), which most
of thick enough multilayer graphene samples have. We propose a procedure that
allows us to extract the SF contribution to the MR we have measured at 0.48~K
$\leq T \leq$ 250~K and 0~T$\leq B \lesssim$ 65~T. We found that the MR
behavior of part of the SFs is similar to that of granular superconductors with
a superconducting critical temperature $T_c \sim $ 350~K, in agreement with
recent publications. The measurements were done on a multilayer graphene TEM
lamella, contacting the edges of the two-dimensional SFs.

<br>
We present a study of high-quality BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$ single crystals via
magnetization, heat-capacity, thermal-expansion and magnetostriction
measurements. Sharp anomalies in the thermodynamic properties at $T_N=3.4\,$K
reveal a long-range antiferromagnetic order in these single-crystalline
samples, which is absent in polycrystalline BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$. The
temperature dependent magnetic susceptibilities for in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetic fields are strongly anisotropic and reveal a pronounced easy-plane
anisotropy. A Curie-Weiss analysis implies strong orbital magnetism, as it is
known from the sister compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ that is discussed as a
potential Kitaev spin-liquid material. When applying in-plane magnetic fields
at low temperature, BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$ is driven to another ordered phase at
a critical field $H_{C1}\approx 0.11\,$T and then undergoes a further
field-induced transition to a highly polarized paramagnetic phase at
$H_{C2}\approx 0.3\,$T, which is again similar to the case of
BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. In addition, our lowest-temperature data reveal that the
field-induced transitions in BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$ become dominated by thermally
assisted domain-wall motion.

Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes are near-one dimensional
semiconductors with strong spin-orbit interaction, a nanomaterial highly
promising for quantum electronic applications. Here, we demonstrate that a
bismuth semimetal layer between the contact metal and this nanomaterial
strongly improves the properties of the contacts. Two-point resistances on the
order of $100\textrm{k}\Omega$ are observed at room temperature. At cryogenic
temperature, Coulomb blockade is visible. The resulting stability diagrams
indicate a marked absence of trap states at the contacts and the corresponding
disorder, compared to previous devices using low-work function metals as
contacts. Single level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below
100mK.

Kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets are known to be highly sensitive
to perturbations caused by structural disorder. NMR is a local probe ideally
suited for investigating such disorder-induced effects, but in practice large
distributions in the conventional one-dimensional NMR data make it difficult to
distinguish the intrinsic behavior expected for pristine kagome quantum spin
liquids from extrinsic effects induced by disorder. Here we report a novel
two-dimensional NMR data acquisition scheme applied to Zn-barlowite
(Zn$_{0.95}$Cu$_{0.05}$)Cu$_{3}$(OD)$_{6}$FBr kagome lattice, and successfully
correlate the distribution of the low energy spin excitations with that of the
local spin susceptibility. We present evidence for the gradual growth of
domains with a local spin polarization induced by 5\% Cu$^{2+}$ defect spins
occupying the interlayer non-magnetic Zn$^{2+}$ sites. These spin polarized
domains account for $\sim60$\% of the sample volume at 2~K, where extrinsic
gapless excitations dominate the low energy sector of spin excitations within
the kagome planes.

A Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel with a nominal composition of
Fe-16.4Mn-0.9C-0.5Si-0.05Nb-0.05V was deformed to an engineering strain of 6\%.
The strain around the deformation twins were mapped using the 4D-STEM
technique. Strain mapping showed a large average elastic strain of
approximately 6\% in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the twinning
direction. However, the large average strain comprised of several hot spots of
even larger strains of up to 12\%. These hot spots could be attributed to a
high density of sessile Frank dislocations on the twin boundary and correspond
to shear stresses of 1--1.5 GPa. The strain and therefore stress fields are
significantly larger than other materials known to twin and are speculated to
be responsible for the early thickness saturation of TWIP steel nanotwins. The
ability to keep twins extremely thin helps improve grain fragmentation,
\textit{i.e.} the dynamic Hall-Petch effect, and underpins the large
elongations and strain hardening rates in TWIP steels.

Recent studies in heavily hole-doped iron-based superconductor RbFe$_2$As$_2$
have suggested the emergence of novel electronic nematicity directed along the
Fe-As direction, 45$^\circ$ rotated from the usual nematicity ubiquitously
found in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and related materials. This motivates us to study the
physical properties of Ba$_{1-x}$Rb$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, details of which
remain largely unexplored. Here we report on the normal-state charge transport
in Ba$_{1-x}$Rb$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ superconductors by using high-quality
single crystals in the range of Rb concentration $0.14\le x \le 1.00$. From the
systematic measurements of the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
$\rho(T)$, we find a signature of a deviation from the Fermi liquid behavior
around the optimal composition, which does not seem related to the
antiferromagnetic quantum criticality but has a potential link to hidden
nematic quantum criticality. In addition, electron correlations derived from
the coefficient of $T^2$ resistivity show a marked increase with Rb content
near the heavily hole-doped end, consistent with the putative Mott physics near
the $3d^5$ electron configuration in iron-based superconductors.

We report the effect of remote surface optical (RSO) phonon scattering on
carrier mobility in monolayer graphene gated by ferroelectric oxide. We
fabricate monolayer graphene transistors back-gated by epitaxial (001)
Ba$_{0.6}$Sr$_{0.4}$TiO$_{3}$ films, with field effect mobility up to 23,000
cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ achieved. Switching the ferroelectric polarization
induces nonvolatile modulation of resistance and quantum Hall effect in
graphene at low temperatures. Ellipsometry spectroscopy studies reveal four
pairs of optical phonon modes in Ba$_{0.6}$Sr$_{0.4}$TiO$_{3}$, from which we
extract the RSO phonon frequencies. The temperature dependence of resistivity
in graphene can be well accounted for by considering the scattering from the
intrinsic longitudinal acoustic phonon and the RSO phonon, with the latter
dominated by the mode at 35.8 meV. Our study reveals the room temperature
mobility limit of ferroelectric-gated graphene transistors imposed by RSO
phonon scattering.

<h3>On the choice of diameters in a polydisperse model glassformer:  deterministic or stochastic?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15528" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15528</a>

<br>
In particle-based computer simulations of polydisperse glassforming systems,
the particle diameters $\sigma = \sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_N$ of a system with
$N$ particles are chosen with the intention to approximate a desired
distribution density $f$ with the corresponding histogram. One method to
accomplish this is to draw each diameter randomly from the density $f$. We
refer to this stochastic scheme as model $\mathcal{S}$. Alternatively, one can
apply a deterministic method, assigning an appropriate set of $N$ values to the
diameters. We refer to this method as model $\mathcal{D}$. We show that
especially for the glassy dynamics at low temperatures it matters whether one
chooses model $\mathcal{S}$ or model $\mathcal{D}$. Using molecular dynamics
computer simulation, we investigate a three-dimensional polydisperse
non-additive soft-sphere system with $f(s) \sim s^{-3}$. The Swap Monte Carlo
method is employed to obtain equilibrated samples at very low temperatures. We
show that for model $\mathcal{S}$ the sample-to-sample fluctuations due to the
quenched disorder imposed by the diameters $\sigma$ can be explained by an
effective packing fraction. Dynamic susceptibilities in model $\mathcal{S}$ can
be split into two terms: One that is of thermal nature and can be identified
with the susceptibility of model $\mathcal{D}$, and another one originating
from the disorder in $\sigma$. At low temperatures the latter contribution is
the dominating term in the dynamic susceptibility.

<h3>Quantum effects in two-dimensional silicon carbide</h3>

Two-dimensional (2D) silicon carbide is an emergent direct band-gap
semiconductor, recently synthesized, with potential applications in electronic
devices and optoelectronics. Here, we study nuclear quantum effects in this 2D
material by means of path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations in the
temperature range from 25 to 1500~K. Interatomic interactions are modeled by a
tight-binding Hamiltonian fitted to density-functional calculations. Quantum
atomic delocalization combined with anharmonicity of the vibrational modes
cause changes in structural and thermal properties of 2D SiC, which we quantify
by comparison of PIMD results with those derived from classical molecular
dynamics simulations, as well as with those given by a quantum harmonic
approximation. Nuclear quantum effects are found to be appreciable in
structural properties such as the layer area and interatomic distances.
Moreover, we consider a {\em real} area for the SiC sheet, which takes into
account bending and rippling at finite temperatures. Differences between this
area and the in-plane area are discussed in the context of quantum atomic
dynamics. The bending constant ($\kappa = 1.0$ eV) and the 2D modulus of
hydrostatic compression ($B_{xy}$ = 5.5 eV/\AA$^2$) are clearly lower than the
corresponding values for graphene. This study paves the way for a deeper
understanding of the elastic and mechanical properties of 2D SiC.

<h3>Surface Rearrangement and Evaporation Kinetics of Supported Gold  Nanoparticle Catalysts</h3>

Heterogeneous catalysts consisting of supported metallic nanoparticles
typically derive exceptional catalytic activity from their large proportion of
under-coordinated surface sites which promote adsorption of reactant molecules.
Simultaneously, these high energy surface configurations are unstable, leading
to nanoparticle growth or degradation, and eventually a loss of catalytic
activity. Surface morphology of catalytic nanoparticles is paramount to
catalytic activity, selectivity, as well as degradation rates, however, it is
well-known that harsh reaction conditions can cause the surface structure to
change. Still, limited research has focused on understanding the link between
nanoparticle surface facets and degradation rates or mechanisms. Here, we study
a model Au supported catalyst system over a range of temperatures using a
combination of \textit{in situ} Transmission Electron Microscopy, kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations, and density functional theory calculations to establish an
atomistic picture of how variations in surface structures and atomic
coordination environments lead to shifting evolution mechanisms as a function
of temperature. By combining experimental results, which yield direct
observation of dynamic shape changes and particle evaporation rates, with
computational techniques, which enable understanding the fundamental
thermodynamics and kinetics of nanoparticle evolution, we illustrate a two-step
evolution mechanism in which mobile adatoms form through desorption from
low-coordination facets and subsequently evaporate off the particle surface. By
understanding the role of temperature in the competition between surface
diffusion and evaporation, we are able to show how individual atomic movements
lead to particle-scale morphological changes, and rationalize why evaporation
rates vary between particles in a system of nearly identical nanoparticles.

<h3>Atomistic Mechanisms of Sliding in Few-Layer and Bulk Doped MoS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15629" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15629</a>

<i>Enrique Guerrero, David A. Strubbe</i>
<br>
Sliding of two-dimensional materials is critical for their application as
solid lubricants for space, and also relevant for strain engineering and device
fabrication. Dopants such as Ni surprisingly improve lubrication in MoS$_2$,
despite formation of interlayer bonds by intercalated Ni, and the mechanism has
remained unclear. While sliding on the atomistic level has been theoretically
investigated in pristine 2D materials, there has been little work on doped
forms, especially for the complicated case of intercalation. We use density
functional theory to study sliding of Ni-doped MoS$_2$, considering Mo/S
substitution and octahedral/tetrahedral intercalation. We find that bulk and
trilayers are well described by pairwise bilayer interactions. Tetrahedral
intercalation between layers dramatically increases their sliding barrier, but
minimally affects sliding between adjacent undoped layers, thus preserving
effective lubrication. We provide an atomistic view of how sliding occurs in
doped transition-metal dichalcogenides, and a general methodology to analyze
doped sliding.
