<h3>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality at the Edge of Laughlin States</h3>

In this letter, we investigate the dissipative dynamics at the edge of
Laughlin fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states starting from the hydrodynamic
framework of the composite Boson theory recently developed in arXiv:2203.06516.
Critical to this description is the choice of boundary conditions, which
ultimately stems from the choice of hydrodynamic variables in terms of
condensate degrees of freedom. Given the gapped nature of bulk, one would
expect dissipation effects to play an important role only near the FQH edge.
Thus, one envisions a scenario where the bulk hydro equations remain
unmodified, while the dissipation effects are introduced at the edge via
boundary conditions. We have recently shown that the anomaly requirements fix
the boundary conditions of the FQH fluid to be no-penetration and no-stress
boundary conditions. In this work, we introduce energy dissipation in the
no-stress boundary condition leading to charge diffusion at the boundary. The
resulting dissipative edge dynamics is quite rigid from a hydro perspective, as
it has to preserve the edge charge continuity and the anomaly structure. We
show that the diffusive edge dynamics with fluctuation-dissipation relations
within a power counting scheme belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality
class.

<h3>Magic Angle Butterfly in Twisted Trilayer Graphene</h3>

We consider a configuration of three stacked graphene monolayers with
commensurate twist angles $\theta_{12}/\theta_{23}=p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are
coprime integers with $0<p<|q|$ and $q$ can be positive or negative. We study
this system using the continuum model in the chiral limit when interlayer
coupling terms between $\textrm{AA}_{12}$ and $\textrm{AA}_{23}$ sites of the
moir\'{e} patterns $12$ and $23$ are neglected. There are only three
inequivalent displacements between the moir\'{e} patterns $12$ and $23$, at
which the three monolayers' Dirac zero modes are protected. Remarkably, for
these displacements and an arbitrary $p/q$ we discover exactly flat bands at an
infinite set of twist angles (magic angles). We provide theoretical explanation
and classification of all possible configurations and topologies of the flat
bands.

<h3>Dynamics of the antiferromagnetic spin ice phase in pyrochlore spinels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16386" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16386</a>

Motivated by the classical spin-nematic state observed in the breathing
pyrochlore spinel LiGa$_{0.95}$In$_{0.05}$Cr$_4$O$_8$, we theoretically discuss
spin dynamics in models of spin-lattice coupling in these materials.
Semiclassical dynamical simulations successfully recover the key features of
inelastic neutron-scattering experiments on
LiGa$_{0.95}$In$_{0.05}$Cr$_4$O$_8$: a broad finite-energy peak alongside a
continuum of scattering near the (200) wave vector that extends from the
elastic line to high energies. To interpret this result, we develop a
small-fluctuation theory for the spin-ice-like nematic ground states, analogous
to linear spin-wave theory for conventionally ordered magnets, which reproduces
the numerical simulation results quantitatively. In particular, we find that
the inelastic peak is well explained by collective modes confined to
ferromagnetic loops of the underlying nematic order. In addition, we find a
sharp, linearly dispersing mode in the dynamical structure factor, which
originates in long-wavelength fluctuations of the nematic director: We believe
identifying this mode will be an interesting target for future experiments on
these materials. We also outline potential future applications of our methods
to both pyrochlore spinels and other spin-nematic systems.

<h3>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the  Disordered, and the Intrinsic</h3>

Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases,
playing an essential role from symmetry-protection of topological insulators to
symmetry charge fractionalization on anyons in fractional quantum Hall effect.
Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from decoherence in
open quantum systems or disorders in imperfect crystalline solids, have
recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum
states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that keep the total
ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. It was realized that
symmetry-protected topological phases could be well-defined for such mixed
states carrying average symmetries. In this work, we present a systematic
classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological
(ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average
and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate
the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered
bosonic systems. We demonstrate that numerous concepts from pure state
symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases, such as anyon permutation, symmetry
fractionalization, and 't Hooft anomaly, are well-defined for ASET phases but
with various intriguing twists. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced
issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics.

<h3>Type-II Dirac points and Dirac nodal loops on the magnons of  square-hexagon-octagon lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16419</a>

<br>
<br>
We study topological magnons on an anisotropic square-hexagon-octagon (SHO)
lattice which has been found by a two-dimensional Biphenylene network (BPN). We
propose the concepts of type-II Dirac magnonic states where new schemes to
achieve topological magnons are unfolded without requiring the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions (DMIs). In the ferromagnetic states, the
topological distinctions at the type-II Dirac points along with one-dimensional
(1D) closed lines of Dirac magnon nodes are characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
invariant. We find pair annihilation of the Dirac magnons and use the Wilson
loop method to depict the topological protection of the band-degeneracy. The
Green's function approach is used to calculte chiral edge modes and magnon
density of states (DOS). We introduce the DMIs to gap the type-II Dirac magnon
points and demonstrate the Dirac nodal loops (DNLs) are robust against the DMIs
within a certain parameter range. The topological phase diagram of magnon bands
is given via calculating the Berry curvature and Chern number. We find that the
anomalous thermal Hall conductivity gives connection to the magnon edge
current. Furthermore, we derive the differential gyromagnetic ratio to exhibit
the Einstein-de Haas effect (EdH) of magnons with topological features.

<h3>Influence of orientational disorder in the adsorbent on the structure  and dynamics of the adsorbate: MD simulations of SO$_2$ in ZSM-22</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16428</a>
<br>
<i>I. Dhiman, Sadique Vellamarthodika, Siddharth Gautam</i>
<br>
<br>
Structural and dynamical behavior of SO$_2$ molecules within ZSM22 is studied
using MD simulations, to understand the influence of orientational disorder
(OD) and intercrystalline spacing in ZSM22 as a function of adsorbate loading.
Addition of inter-crystalline space provides connectivity of isolated pores in
ZSM22 and is shown to suppress both translational and rotational motion of
SO$_2$. We infer that geometry and dimensionality of the connecting space is an
important factor in determining the effects of pore connectivity on the
adsorbed species behavior. As a function of OD, decrease in self diffusion
coefficient of SO$_2$ in ZSM22 is observed. An increase in rotational
correlation time t and a decrease in libration angle with OD is observed, due
to the restriction imposed on the orientational freedom of the adsorbate by an
increase in OD. The behavior of SO$_2$ result from an interplay of guest-host
interactions and the dimensionality and confinement geometry.

<h3>Bridgman formula for the thermal conductivity of atomic and molecular  liquids</h3>

<br>
<br>
A simple and popular Bridgman's model predicts a linear correlation between
the thermal conductivity coefficient and the sound velocity of dense liquids. A
proportionality coefficient proposed originally is fixed and independent of the
liquid molecular structure. This work reports a systematic analysis of
correlations between thermal conductivity and sound velocity in simple model
systems (hard sphere and Lennard-Jones fluids), monoatomic liquids (argon and
krypton), diatomic liquids (nitrogen and oxygen), and several polyatomic
liquids (water, carbon dioxide, methane, and ethane). It is demonstrated that
linear correlations are well reproduced for model fluids as well as real
monoatomic and diatomic liquids, but seem less convincing in polyatomic
molecular liquids. The coefficient of proportionality is not fixed; it is about
unity for monoatomic liquids and generally increases with molecular complexity.
Some implications for the possibility to predict the thermal conductivity
coefficients are discussed.

<h3>Optical and electronic properties of a two-dimensional quantum ring  under rotating effects</h3>

This work presents a study on the nonrelativistic quantum motion of a charged
particle in a rotating frame, considering the Aharonov-Bohm effect and a
uniform magnetic field. We derive the equation of motion and the corresponding
radial equation to describe the system. The Schr\"odinger equation with minimal
coupling incorporates rotation effects by substituting the momentum operator
with an effective four-potential. Additionally, a radial potential term,
dependent on the average radius of the ring, is introduced. The analysis is
restricted to motion in a two-dimensional plane, neglecting the degree of
freedom in the $z$-direction. By solving the radial equation, we determine the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, allowing for an explicit expression of the
energy. The probability distribution is analyzed for varying rotating parameter
values, revealing a shift of the distribution as the rotation changes,
resulting in a centrifugal effect and occupation of the ring's edges.
Furthermore, numerical analysis demonstrates the significant rotational effects
on energy levels and optical properties, including optical absorption and
refractive coefficients.

A rigorous methodology is developed for computing elastic fields generated by
experimentally observed defect structures within grains in a polycrystal that
has undergone tensile extension. An example application is made using a
near-field High Energy X-ray Diffraction Microscope measurement of a zirconium
sample that underwent $13.6\%$ tensile extension from an initially
well-annealed state. (Sub)grain boundary features are identified with apparent
disclination line defects in them. The elastic fields of these features
identified from the experiment are calculated.

The direct manipulation of spins via light may provide a path toward
ultrafast energy-efficient devices. However, distinguishing the microscopic
processes that can occur during ultrafast laser excitation in magnetic alloys
is challenging. Here, we combine the element-specificity of extreme ultraviolet
high harmonic probes with time-dependent density functional theory to
disentangle the competition between three ultrafast processes that occur in
Co2MnGa: same-site Co-Co spin transfer, intersite Co-Mn spin transfer, and
ultrafast spin flips mediated by spin-orbit coupling. By measuring the dynamic
magnetic asymmetry across the entire M-edges of the two magnetic sublattices
involved, we uncover the relative dominance of these processes at different
probe energy regions and times during the laser pulse. The theoretical
calculations demonstrate that pump-induced changes of magnetic asymmetry do not
necessarily scale linearly with changes of the magnetic moment. The combined
theoretical and experimental approach presented here enables a comprehensive
microscopic interpretation of laser-induced magnetization dynamics on time
scales shorter than 100 fs.

<h3>Pair-Variational Autoencoders (PairVAE) for Linking and  Cross-Reconstruction of Characterization Data from Complementary Structural  Characterization Techniques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16467</a>

In material research, structural characterization often requires multiple
complementary techniques to obtain a holistic morphological view of the
synthesized material. Depending on the availability of and accessibility of the
different characterization techniques (e.g., scattering, microscopy,
spectroscopy), each research facility or academic research lab may have access
to high-throughput capability in one technique but face limitations (sample
preparation, resolution, access time) with other techniques(s). Furthermore,
one type of structural characterization data may be easier to interpret than
another (e.g., microscopy images are easier to interpret than small angle
scattering profiles). Thus, it is useful to have machine learning models that
can be trained on paired structural characterization data from multiple
techniques so that the model can generate one set of characterization data from
the other. In this paper we demonstrate one such machine learning workflow,
PairVAE, that works with data from Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) that
presents information about bulk morphology and images from Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) that presents two-dimensional local structural information of
the sample. Using paired SAXS and SEM data of novel block copolymer assembled
morphologies [open access data from Doerk G.S., et al. Science Advances. 2023
Jan 13;9(2): eadd3687], we train our PairVAE. After successful training, we
demonstrate that the PairVAE can generate SEM images of the block copolymer
morphology when it takes as input that sample's corresponding SAXS 2D pattern,
and vice versa. This method can be extended to other soft materials
morphologies as well and serves as a valuable tool for easy interpretation of
2D SAXS patterns as well as creating a database for other downstream
calculations of structure-property relationships.

<h3>First Principles Study of Photocatalytic Water Splitting by  M$_1$M$_2$CO$_2$ (M$_1$ = Zr,Hf; M$_2$ = Hf,Ti,Sc) MXenes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16476" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16476</a>

<i>Sima Rastegar, Alireza Rastkar Ebrahimzadeh, Jaber Jahanbin Sardroodi</i>

Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigated the structural,
electronic and optical properties of functionalized and doped MXenes such as
M$_1$M$_2$CO$_2$ (M$_1$ = Zr,Hf; M$_2$ = Hf,Ti,Sc). This study aimed to find a
suitable photocatalyst that would work well in the water splitting process.
Among the calculated nanostructures, MXenes ZrHfCO$_2$ and ZrTiCO$_2$ were
chosen as the suitable photocatalysts for the water splitting process. The
calculated value of the band gaps with the GGA-PBE functional was 1.08(0.79) eV
for the ZrHfCO$_2$ (ZrTiCO$_2$) monolayer. Also, the band gaps for these
monolayers with the HSE06 hybrid functional were 1.86 and 1.57 eV,
respectively. These MXenes' optical properties, such as complex dielectric
function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, and reflectivity, were also
investigated. The results showed that these monolayers had good absorption in
the visible and ultraviolet regions. Additionally, we discovered that
ZrHfCO$_2$ and ZrTiCO$_2$ MXenes could be used for the water splitting process
by calculating the photocatalytic properties. Meanwhile, the results showed
that the monolayers of M$_1$M$_2$CO$_2$ could be promising candidates for
photocatalytic, solar energy, and optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Stochastic metrology and the empirical distribution</h3>

We study the problem of parameter estimation in time series stemming from
general stochastic processes, where the outcomes may exhibit arbitrary temporal
correlations. In particular, we address the question of how much Fisher
information is lost if the stochastic process is compressed into a single
histogram, known as the empirical distribution. As we show, the answer is
non-trivial due to the correlations between outcomes. We derive practical
formulas for the resulting Fisher information for various scenarios, from
generic stationary processes to discrete-time Markov chains to continuous-time
classical master equations. The results are illustrated with several examples.

<h3>Disorder-driven localization and electron interactions in Bi$_x$TeI thin  films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16486</a>

<br>
<br>
Strong disorder has a crucial effect on the electronic structure in quantum
materials by increasing localization, interactions, and modifying the density
of states. Bi$_x$TeI films grown at room temperature and \SI{230}{K} exhibit
dramatic magnetotransport effects due to disorder, localization and electron
correlation effects, including a MIT at a composition that depends on growth
temperature. The increased disorder caused by growth at 230K causes the
conductivity to decrease by several orders of magnitude, for several
compositions of Bi$_x$TeI. The transition from metal to insulator with
decreasing composition $x$ is accompanied by a decrease in the dephasing length
which leads to the disappearance of the weak-antilocalization effect.
Electron-electron interactions cause low temperature conductivity corrections
on the metallic side and Efros-Shklovskii (ES) variable range hopping on the
insulating side, effects which are absent in single crystalline Bi$_x$TeI. The
observation of a tunable metal-insulator transition and the associated strong
localization and quantum effects in Bi$_x$TeI shows the possibility of tuning
spin transport in quantum materials via disorder.

<h3>Origin of magnetic anisotropy in $La_{(1\-x)}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}$</h3>

<br>
<i>Birendra Kumar, Harish Chandr Chauhan, Ajay Baro, Jyoti Saini, Ankita Tiwari, Mukesh Verma, Yugandhar Bitla, Subhasis Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
Here, we report the origin of magnetic anisotropy in Sr-doped infinite layer
manganites $La_{(1\-x)}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}$ (0.125 \leq x \leq 0.400). Magnetic
anisotropy is responsible for the large difference in the temperature
dependence of field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetization. Translational
symmetry breaking in the context of spins around the boundary between the
ferromagnetic (FM) antiferromagnetic (AFM) region leads to FM-AFM interaction
and results in magnetic anisotropy (exchange anisotropy). Here, we propose that
FM-AFM interaction around the boundary between FM clusters or domains in the
AFM background or between AFM clusters or domains in the ferromagnetic
background is responsible for doping-dependent nonmonotonic behavior and the
origin of magnetic anisotropy.

<h3>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Open Quantum Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16496</a>
<br>
<i>Kohei Kawabata, Ramanjit Sohal, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<br>
<br>
The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem provides a general constraint on
quantum many-body systems and plays a significant role in the Haldane gap
phenomena and topological phases of matter. Here, we extend the LSM theorem to
open quantum systems and establish a general theorem that restricts the steady
state and spectral gap of Liouvillians based solely on symmetry. Specifically,
we demonstrate that the unique gapped steady state is prohibited when
translation invariance and $\mathrm{U} \left( 1 \right)$ symmetry are
simultaneously present for noninteger filling numbers. As an illustrative
example, we find that no dissipative gap is open in the spin-$1/2$ dissipative
Heisenberg model while a dissipative gap can be open in the spin-$1$
counterpart -- an analog of the Haldane gap phenomena in open quantum systems.
Furthermore, we show that the LSM constraint manifests itself in a quantum
anomaly of the dissipative form factor of Liouvillians. We also find the LSM
constraints due to symmetry intrinsic to open quantum systems, such as
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry.

<h3>Tuning charge density wave order and structure via uniaxial stress in a  stripe-ordered cuprate superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16499" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16499</a>

<br>
<br>
Unidirectional spin and charge density wave order in the cuprates is known to
compete with superconductivity. In the stripe order (La,M)$_2$CuO$_4$ family of
cuprates, spin and charge order occur as unidirectional order that can be
stabilized by symmetry breaking structural distortions, such as the low
temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase. Here we examine the interplay between
structure and the formation of charge density wave (CDW) order in the LTT phase
of La$_{1.475}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ by applying uniaxial stress to
distort the structure and influence the formation of CDW order. Using resonant
soft x-ray scattering to measure both the CDW order and (0 0 1)
structural-nematic Bragg peaks, we find that the application of uniaxial stress
along the Cu-O bond direction suppresses the (0 0 1) peak and has the net
effect of reducing CDW order, but does so only for CDW order propagating
parallel to the applied stress. We connect these observations to previous work
showing an enhanced superconducting transition temperature under uniaxial
stress; providing insight into how CDW, superconductivity, nematicity, and
structure are related and can be tuned relative to one another in cuprates.

<h3>Two-dimensional assembly of nanoparticles grafted with charged-end-group  polymers</h3>

<i>Hyeong Jin Kim, Binay P. Nayak, Honghu Zhang, Benjamin M. Ocko, Alex Travesset, David Vaknin, Surya K. Mallapragada, Wenjie Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
{\bf Hypothesis:} Introducing charged terminal groups to polymers that graft
nanoparticles enables Coulombic control over their assembly by tuning pH and
salinity of aqueous suspensions.
{\bf Experiments:} Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are grafted with poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) terminated with CH3 (charge neutral), COOH (negatively charged),
or NH2 (positively charged) groups. The nanoparticles are characterized using
dynamic light scattering, {\zeta}-potential, and thermal gravimetric analysis.
Liquid surface X-ray reflectivity (XR) and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray
scattering (GISAXS) techniques are employed to determine the density profile
and in-plane structure of the AuNP assembly across and on the aqueous surface.
{\bf Findings:} The assembly of PEG-AuNPs at the liquid/vapor interface can
be tuned by adjusting pH or salinity, particularly for COOH terminals. However,
the effect is less pronounced for NH2 terminals. These distinct assembly
behaviors are attributed to the overall charge of PEG-AuNPs and the
conformation of PEG. The COOH-PEG corona is the most compact, resulting in
smaller superlattice constants. The net charge per particle depends not only on
the PEG terminal groups but also on the cation sequestration of PEG and the
intrinsic negative charge of the AuNP surface. NH2-PEG, due to its closeness to
overall charge neutrality and the presence of hydrogen bonding, enables the
assembly of NH2-PEG-AuNPs more readily.

The transport properties of matter have been widely investigated. In
particular, shear viscosity over a wide parameter space is crucial for various
applications, such as designing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets and
determining the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In a previous work [Phys.Rev.E,
106, 014142], based on the statistics of random-walk ions and the Debye
shielding effect, we have developed an analytical model called ``random-walk
shielding-potential viscosity mode'' (RWSP-VM) to calculate the shear viscosity
of metals in warm temperature region (several tens of eV to hundreds of eV). In
this work, we extend RWSP-VM to apply not only to warm temperature region but
also to hot temperature region (hundreds of eV to millions of eV), where we
reconsider the collision diameter that is introduced by hard-sphere concept.
The results of Al, Fe, and U show that this model provides a systematic way to
calculate the shear viscosity of arbitrary metals in warm and hot temperature
region and at the densities from about 0.5 to 10 times the normal density (the
density at room temperature and 1 standard atmosphere).

Ferroelectric memristors have attracted much attention as a type of
nonvolatile resistance switching memories in neuromorphic computing, image
recognition, and information storage. Their resistance switching mechanisms
have been studied several times in perovskite and complicated materials
systems. It was interpreted as the modulation of carrier transport by
polarization control over Schottky barriers. Here, we experimentally report the
isothermal resistive switching across a CoPt/MgZnO Schottky barrier using a
simple binary semiconductor. The crystal and texture properties showed
high-quality and single-crystal Co$_{0.30}$Pt$_{0.70}$/Mg$_{0.20}$Zn$_{0.80}$O
hetero-junctions. The resistive switching was examined by an electric-field
cooling method that exhibited a ferroelectric T$_C$ of MgZnO close to the bulk
value. The resistive switching across CoPt/MgZnO Schottky barrier was
accompanied by a change in the Schottky barrier height of 26.5 meV due to an
interfacial charge increase and/or orbital hybridization induced reversal of
MgZnO polarization. The magnitude of the reversed polarization was estimated to
be a reasonable value of 3.0 (8.25) $\mu$ C/cm$^2$ at 300 K (2 K). These
findings demonstrated the utilities of CoPt/MgZnO interface as a potential
candidate for ferroelectric memristors and can be extended to probe the
resistive switching of other hexagonal ferroelectric materials.

<h3>The mechanism of the Silicon irradiation synergistic effect explained by  multiscale simulations of Monte Carlo and excited-state first-principle  calculations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Neutron and $\gamma$-ray irradiation damages to transistors are found to be
non-additive, and this is denoted as the irradiation synergistic effect (ISE).
Its mechanism is not well-understood. The recent defect-based model [ACS Appl.
Electron. Mater. 2, 3783 (2020)] for Silicon bipolar junction transistors (BJT)
achieve quantitative agreement with experiments, but it remains
phenomenological and its assumptions on the defect reactions are unverified.
Going beyond the phenomenological model requires directly representing the
effect of $\gamma$-ray irradiation in first-principles calculations, which is
not feasible previously. In this work, we examine the defect-based model of the
ISE by developing a multiscale method for the simulation of the $\gamma$-ray
irradiation, where the $\gamma$-ray-induced electronic excitations are treated
explicitly in excited-state first-principles calculations. We find the
calculations agree with experiments, and the effect of the $\gamma$-ray-induced
excitation is significantly different from the effects of defect charge state
and temperature. We propose a diffusion-based qualitative explanation of the
mechanism of positive/negative ISE in NPN/PNP BJTs in the end.

<h3>Emergence of pseudo-time during optimal Monte Carlo sampling and  temporal aspects of symmetry breaking and restoration</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16603</a>
<br>
<i>Yang He, Vassiliy Lubchenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We argue that one can associate a pseudo-time with sequences of
configurations generated in the course of classical Monte Carlo simulations for
a single-minimum bound state, if the sampling is optimal. Hereby the sampling
rates can be, under special circumstances, calibrated against the relaxation
rate and frequency of motion of an actual physical system. The latter
possibility is linked to the optimal sampling regime being a universal
crossover separating two distinct suboptimal sampling regimes analogous to the
physical phenomena of diffusion and effusion, respectively. Bound states break
symmetry; one may thus regard the pseudo-time as a quantity emerging together
with the bound state. Conversely, when transport among distinct bound states
takes place -- thus restoring symmetry -- a pseudo-time can no longer be
defined. One can still quantify activation barriers, if the latter barriers are
smooth, but the simulation becomes impractically slow and pertains to
overdamped transport only. Specially designed Monte Carlo moves that bypass
activation barriers -- so as to accelerate sampling of the thermodynamics --
amount to effusive transport and lead to severe under-sampling of
transition-state configurations that separate distinct bound states while
destroying the said universality. Implications of the present findings for
simulations of glassy liquids are discussed.

<br>
<br>
Topotactic transition is a structural phase change in a matrix crystal
lattice mediated by the ordered loss/gain and rearrangement of atoms, leading
to unusual coordination environments and metal atoms with rare valent states.
As early as in 1990s, low temperature hydride reduction was utilized to realize
the topotactic transition. Since then, topological transformations have been
developed via multiple approaches. Especially, the recent discovery of the
Ni-based superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has greatly boosted the
topotactic transition mean to synthesizing new oxides for exploring exotic
functional properties. In this review, we have provided a detailed and
generalized introduction to oxygen-related topotactic transition. The main body
of our review include four parts: the structure-facilitated effects, the
mechanism of the topotactic transition, some examples of topotactic transition
methods adopted in different metal oxides (V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) and the related
applications. This work is to provide timely and thorough strategies to
successfully realize topotactic transitions for researchers who are eager to
create new oxide phases or new oxide materials with desired functions.

<h3>Lattice distortions, moiré phonons, and relaxed electronic band  structures in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<i>Bo Xie, Jianpeng Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we present a theoretical research on the lattice relaxations,
phonon properties, and relaxed electronic structures in magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG). We construct a continuum elastic model in order to
study the lattice dynamics of magic-angle TBG, where both in-plane and
out-of-plane lattice displacements are take into account. The fully relaxed
lattice structure calculated using such a model is in quantitative agreement
with experimental measurements. Furthermore, we investigate the phonon
properties in magic-angle TBG using the continuum elastic model, where both the
in-plane and out-of-plane phonon modes are included and treated on equal
footing. We identify different types of moir\'e phonons including in-plane
sliding modes, soft out-of-plane flexural modes, as well as out-of-plane
breathing modes. The latter two types of phonon modes exhibit interesting
monopolar, dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar-type out-of-plane vibration
patterns. Additionally, we explore the impact of the relaxed moir\'e
superlattice structure on the electronic band structures of magic-angle TBG
using an effective continuum model, which shows nearly exact agreement with
those calculated using a microscopic atomistic tight-binding approach. Our work
lays foundation for further studies on the electron-phonon coupling effects and
their interplay with $e$-$e$ interactions in magic-angle TBG.

Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features a fascinating set
of self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation
to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters
of the system. In the present Letter, we consider the formation of micelles
from particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened
nose and moving towards the cusp. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic
swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form
micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia in accordance
with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov, A. Borisov, Particles 2021
(2021)]. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any charge
asymmetry, in contrast to that observed in surfactants, and is governed by an
interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry. This renders the observed
ordering reversible upon switching of the particles' activity and opens the
route towards novel applications in tunable structuring of materials.

<h3>Effect of solute atoms segregation on Al grain boundary properties by  First-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16677</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
First-principles calculations were carried out to study the segregation
behavior of Mg, and Cu and their effect on the energy and mechanical properties
of different Al grain boundaries (GBs). Four symmetrical tilt GBs were selected
for study, namely {\Sigma}5[001](210) GB, {\Sigma}5[001](310) GB,
{\Sigma}9[110](221) GB, and {\Sigma}11[110](332) GB. The results show that both
Mg and Cu have a segregation tendency at the GBs, and the segregation tendency
of Cu is stronger than Mg. Mg is prone to form substitutional segregation at
the GBs, but Cu is more likely to segregate at the interstitial sites. The
segregation of Mg and Cu can reduce GB energy, and the GB energy continues to
decrease with the increase of the segregation concentration. First-principles
calculation tensile test shows that the segregation of Mg has a negative effect
on the strength of GBs, and the GB strength decreases with the increase of the
Mg concentration, while the GB strength was gradually enhanced with the
increase of the Cu concentration. The strength of {\Sigma}5(210) GB and
{\Sigma}9(221) GB are more sensitive to the segregation of solute atoms than
the other two GBs. By calculating the charge density and the density of states
of the pristine and the segregated GBs, it was found that the segregation of Mg
caused charge depletion and structure expansion at the GBs, while the
segregation of Cu increases the charge density of GBs and form new bonds with
the surrounding Al atoms. The results provide useful information for improving
the mechanical properties of materials by using the concept of GB segregation
engineering.

<h3>Giant enhancement of exciton radiative lifetime by ferroelectric  polarization: The case of monolayer TiOCl$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Exciton binding energy and lifetime are the two most important parameters
controlling exciton dynamics, and the general consensus is that the larger the
former the larger the latter. However our first-principles study of monolayer
ferroelectric TiOCl$_2$ shows that this is not always the case. We find that
ferroelectric polarization tends to weaken exciton binding but enhance exciton
lifetime. This stems from the different effects of the induced built-in
electric field and structural distortion by the spontaneous polarization: the
former always destabilizes or even dissociates the exciton while the latter
leads to a relaxation of the selection rule and activates excitons that are
otherwise not optically active. Their combined effect leads to a halving of the
exciton binding energy but a substantial increase in lifetime by 40 times. Our
results deepen the understanding of the interaction of light with ferroelectric
materials and provide new insights into the use of ferroelectricity to control
exciton dynamics.

<br>
<br>
To understand the interfacial bond formation between polycarbonate (PC) and
magnetron-sputtered metal nitride thin films, PC | X interfaces (X = AlN, TiN,
TiAlN) are comparatively investigated by ab initio simulations as well as X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. The simulations predict significant differences at
the interface, as N and Ti form bonds with all functional groups of the
polymer, while Al reacts selectively only with the carbonate group of pristine
PC. In good agreement with simulations, experimental data reveal that the PC |
AlN and the PC | TiAlN interfaces are mainly defined by interfacial C-N bonds,
whereas for PC | TiN, the interface formation is also characterized by numerous
C-Ti and (C-O)-Ti bonds. Bond strength calculations combined with the measured
interfacial bond density indicate the strongest interface for PC | TiAlN
followed by PC | AlN, whereas the weakest is predicted for PC | TiN due to its
lower density of strong interfacial C-N bonds. This study shows that the
employed computational strategy enables prediction of the interfacial bond
formation between PC and metal nitrides and that it is reasonable to assume
that the research strategy proposed herein can be readily adapted to other
organic | inorganic interfaces.

<h3>Orbital-selective Néel transition in the absence of Hund's rule  coupling</h3>

<br>
<br>
Orbital degrees of freedom amplify the already rich variety of
correlation-driven phenomena in correlated fermion systems. A prominent example
are orbital-selective Mott phases where orbitals containing localized and
itinerant carriers coexist. In this work we investigate possibilities to
realize an orbital selective transition to the ordered magnetic state. A
mechanism for such a transition has been proposed recently on the basis of
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations for a two-orbital Hubbard
model. Considering long-range magnetic fluctuations beyond DMFT changes the
orbital selective type of the N\'eel transition to a conventional one that
occurs simultaneously for both orbitals as a consequence of Hund's exchange
coupling of magnetic fluctuations of different orbitals. Here, we show that in
the absence of Hund's coupling a novel mechanism of an orbital selective N\'eel
transition (OSNT) is at work. On the basis of the two-orbital calculations for
a Hubbard model with different bandwidths we show that the proposed OSNT can be
realized for an arbitrary value of the electronic interaction. We demonstrate
that in the weak coupling regime this transition is governed by a Slater
mechanism and thus occurs first for the narrow orbital. At strong coupling a
Heisenberg mechanism of the OSNT is realized, and the transition occurs first
for the wide orbital. Remarkably, at intermediate values of the interaction we
find a non-trivial regime of the OSNT, where the Slater mechanism leads to a
N\'eel transition that occurs first for the wide orbital.

<h3>Rotation of gap nodes in the topological superconductor  Cu$_x$(PbSe)$_5$(Bi$_2$Se$_3$)$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Among the family of odd-parity topological superconductors derived from
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Cu$_x$(PbSe)$_5$(Bi$_2$Se$_3$)$_6$ has been elucidated to have
gap nodes. Although the nodal gap structure has been established by
specific-heat and thermal-conductivity measurements, there has been no direct
observation of the superconducting gap of CPSBS using scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy (STS). Here we report the first STS experiments on CPSBS down to
0.35 K, which found that the vortices generated by out-of-plane magnetic fields
have an elliptical shape, reflecting the anisotropic gap structure. The
orientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction
when the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is
rotated by 30$^{\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the
superconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes
are most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface,
allowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries,
can lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at
the surface additionally lifts the nodes. This result establishes the subtle
but crucial role of crystalline symmetry in topological superconductivity.

Grain boundary (GB) segregation of solute atoms plays an important role in
the microstructure and macroscopic mechanical properties of materials. The
study of GB segregation of solute atoms using computational simulation has
become one of the hot spots in recent years. However, most studies mainly focus
on ground-state GB structures with the lowest energy, and the impact of GB
metastability with higher energy on solute segregation remains poorly
understood. In this work, the first-principles method based on the density
functional theory was adopted to investigate the effect of solute atoms Mg and
Cu segregation on ground-state {\Sigma}5(210) GB (GB-I) and metastable
GBs(GB-II, GB-III) in Al. GB energy, segregation energy, and theoretical
tensile strength of Mg and Cu segregation at three GBs were calculated. The
results show that both Mg and Cu have a large driving force to segregate to Al
GBs, which reduces the GB energy and improves improve GB stability. The
segregation of Mg and Cu on GB-III induces the transformation of the GB
structural unit and the GB structural phase transformations. For the above
three GBs, Cu segregation increases the theoretical tensile strength of GBs to
varying degrees. The segregation of Mg would reduce the resistance of GB-I and
GB-II, but enhances the strength of GB-III. The effect of solute atoms
segregation on the mechanical properties of GBs was investigated by charge
density distribution and density of states.

We investigate the transport properties of a Fermi-Hubbard chain with an

potential. We determine the momentum resolved transmission through this
impurity in dependence of the modulation frequency and strength for a single

distinct behaviour from the single particle transmission. Different situations
can occur, where only the single particle or the pair with a certain momentum
are transmitted or filtered out.

<br>
<i>C. Cardoso, A. T. Costa, A. H. MacDonald, J. Fernández-Rossier</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a new class of magnetic proximity effects based on the spin
dependent hybridization between the electronic states at the Fermi energy in a
non-magnetic conductor and the narrow spin split bands of a ferromagnetic
insulator. Unlike conventional exchange proximity, we show this hybridization
proximity effect has a very strong influence on the non-magnetic layer and can
be further modulated by application of an electric field. We use DFT
calculations to illustrate this effect in graphene placed next to a monolayer
of CrI$_3$, a ferromagnetic insulator. We find strong hybridization of the
graphene bands with the narrow conduction band of CrI$_3$ in one spin channel
only. We show that our results are robust with respect to lattice mismatch and
twist angle variations. Furthermore, we show that an out-of-plane electric
field can be used to modulate the hybridization strength, paving the way for
applications.

<br>
The quantum Hall effect is widely used for the investigation of fundamental
phenomena, ranging from topological phases to composite fermions. In
particular, the discovery of a room temperature resistance quantum in graphene
is significant for compact resistance standards that can operate above
cryogenic temperatures. However, this requires large magnetic fields that are
accessible only in a few high magnetic field facilities. Here, we report on the
quantum Hall effect in graphene encapsulated by the ferroelectric insulator
CuInP2S6. Electrostatic gating of the graphene channel enables the Fermi energy
to be tuned so that electrons in the localized states of the insulator are in
equilibrium with the current-carrying, delocalized states of graphene. Due to
the presence of strongly bound states in this hybrid system, a quantum Hall
plateau can be achieved at room temperature in relatively modest magnetic
fields. This phenomenon offers the prospect for the controlled manipulation of
the quantum Hall effect at room temperature.

<h3>Phase-field modelling of failure in ceramics with multiscale porosity</h3>

<br>
<br>
Many stiff biological materials exhibiting outstanding compressive
strength/weight ratio are characterized by high porosity, spanning different
size-scales, typical examples being bone and wood. A successful bio-mimicking
of these materials is provided by a recently-obtained apatite, directly
produced through a biomorphic transformation of natural wood and thus
inheriting its highly hierarchical structure. This unique apatite (but also
wood and bone) is characterized by two major distinct populations of
differently-sized cylindrical voids, a porosity shown in the present paper to
influence failure, both in terms of damage growth and fracture nucleation and
propagation. This statement follows from failure analysis, developed through
in-silico generation of artificial samples (reproducing the two-scale porosity
of the material) and subsequent finite element modelling of damage, implemented
with phase-field treatment for fracture growth. It is found that small voids
promote damage nucleation and enhance bridging of macro-pores by micro-crack
formation, while macro-pores influence the overall material response and drive
the propagation of large fractures. Our results explain the important role of
multiscale porosity characterizing stiff biological materials and lead to a new
design paradigm, by introducing an in-silico tool to implement bio-mimicking in
new artificial materials with brittle behaviour, such as carbide or ceramic
foams.

We have synthesized new Tsai-type Yb-based intermediate-valence approximant
crystals (ACs) with different degree of approximation to quasicrystal,
Zn--Au--Yb 1/1 and 2/1 AC, and studied the external pressure effect on their Yb
mean-valence $\nu$. Whereas 1/1 AC distinctly exhibits a first-order-like jump
in $\nu$ at a transition pressure $P_{\rm v}$, 2/1 AC only shows an indistinct
anomaly at $P_{\rm v}$. We have also studied the pressure dependence of the
$\nu$ of Au--Al--Yb 1/1 AC, which is a prototypal AC exhibiting
pressure-induced quantum criticality. It shows a continuous valence anomaly at
a critical pressure $P_{\rm c}$ where the magnetic susceptibility diverges
toward zero temperature, in contrast to the valence jump in the Zn--Au--Yb 1/1
AC. These results are discussed based on a theoretical model of quantum
critical valence fluctuation.

<h3>Dynamical exchange-correlation potential formalism for  spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg and Hubbard chains: the  antiferromagnetic/half-filled case</h3>

<br>
<br>
The exchange-correlation potential formalism previously introduced and
applied to the one-dimensional Hubbard model has been extended to spin systems
and applied to the case of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic
spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model. Within the spin exchange-correlation
potential formulation, a new sum rule for spin-systems is derived. The
exchange-correlation potential for the Heisenberg model is extrapolated from
exact diagonalization results of small antiferromagnetic Heisenberg clusters.
This procedure is also employed to revisit and computationally improve the
previous investigation of the exchange-correlation potential of the half-filled
Hubbard model, which was based on the exchange-correlation potential of the
dimer. Numerical comparisons with exact benchmark calculations for both the
Heisenberg and the Hubbard models indicate that, starting from the
exchange-correlation potential of a finite cluster, the extrapolation procedure
yields a one-particle spectral function with favorable accuracy at a relatively
low computational cost. In addition, a comparison between the ground state
energies for the one-dimensional Hubbard and Heisenberg models displays how the
well known similarity in behavior of the two models at large interactions
manifests within the exchange-correlation potential formalism.

We review recent work on systems with multiple interacting-particles having
the dynamical feature of stochastic resetting. The interplay of time scales
related to inter-particle interactions and resetting leads to a rich behavior,
both static and dynamic. The presence of multiple particles also opens up a new
possibility for the resetting dynamics itself, namely, that of different
particles resetting all together (global resetting) or independently (local
resetting). We divide the review on the basis of specifics of reset dynamics
(global versus local resetting), and further, on the basis of number (two
versus a large number) of interacting particles. We will primarily be dealing
with classical systems, and only briefly discuss resetting in quantum systems.

Thermal equilibrium properties of nanoscale systems deviate from standard
macroscopic predictions due to a non-negligible coupling to the environment.
For anisotropic three-dimensional materials, we derive the mean force
corrections to the equilibrium state of a classical spin vector. The result is
valid at arbitrary coupling strength. Specifically, we consider cubic,
orthorhombic, and monoclinic symmetries, and compare their spin expectation
values as a function of temperature. We underpin the correctness of the mean
force state by evidencing its match with the steady state of the simulated
non-Markovian spin dynamics. The results show an explicit dependence on the
symmetry of the confining material. In addition, some coupling symmetries show
a spin alignment transition at zero temperature. Finally, we quantify the work
extraction potential of the mean force-generated inhomogeneities in the energy
shells. Such inhomogeneities constitute a classical equivalent to quantum
coherences.

in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Long-range ordering of Ti and O
vacancies in the disordered cubic phase leads to the stabilization of the
vacancy-ordered monoclinic TiO phase. The reduced structural disorder is
correlated with a superconductor-metal transition (SMT) in contrast to the
disorder-driven superconductor-insulator transition observed in cubic TiO,
orthorhombic $Ti_2O_3$, and the Magneli $\gamma-Ti_3O_5$ and $\gamma-Ti_4O_7$
phase. These results confirm the role of disorder related to Ti and O vacancies
and structural inhomogeneity in determining the electronic properties of the
normal state of titanium oxide-based superconductors.

<h3>Weighted Axelrod model: different but similar</h3>

The Axelrod model is a cellular automaton which can be used to describe the
emergence and development of cultural domains, where culture is represented by
a fixed number of cultural features taking a discrete set of possible values
(traits). The Axelrod model is based on two sociological phenomena: homophily
(a tendency for individuals to form bonds with people similar to themselves)
and social influence (the way how individuals change their behavior due to
social pressure). However, the Axelrod model does not take into account the
fact that cultural attributes may have different significance for a given
individual. This is a limitation in the context of how the model reflects
mechanisms driving the evolution of real societies. The study aims to modify
the Axelrod model by giving individual features different weights that have a
decisive impact on the possibility of aligning cultural traits between
(interacting) individuals. The comparison of the results obtained for the
classic Axelrod model and its modified version shows that introduced weights
have a significant impact on the course of the system development, in
particular, increasing the final polarization of the system and increasing the
time needed to reach the final state.

The shift current is part of the second-order optical response of materials
with a close connection to topology. Here we report a sign inversion in the
band-edge shift photoconductivity of the Haldane model when the system
undergoes a topological phase transition. This result is obtained following two
complementary schemes. On one hand, we derive an analytical expression for the
band-edge shift current in a two-band tight-binding model showing that the sign
reversal is driven by the mass term. On the other hand, we perform a numerical
evaluation on a continuum version of the Haldane model. This approach allows us
to include off-diagonal matrix elements of the position operator, which are
discarded in tight-binding models but can contribute significantly to the shift
current. Explicit evaluation of the shift current shows that while the model
predictions remain accurate in the deep tight-binding regime, significant
deviations arise for shallow potential landscapes. Notably, the sign reversal
across the topological phase transition is observed in all regimes, implying it
is a robust effect that could be observable in a wide range of topological
insulators such as $\text{BiTe}_{2}$ and $\text{CsPbI}_{3}$ reported in Phys.

On the basis of shear modulus measurements on a Pt-based glass, we calculated
temperature dependence of the defect concentration c using the Interstitialcy
theory. This temperature dependence is compared with temperature dependence of
the normalized full width at half maximum (FWHM) gamma of the first peak of the
structure factor S(q) for the same glass available in the literature. It is
found that above the glass transition temperature Tg linearly increases with c
in the same way for both initial and relaxed (preannealed) samples providing
the evidence of defect-induced disordering in the supercooled liquid region
independent of glass thermal prehistory. For both states of the samples, the
derivative d(gamma)/dc is close to unity. Below Tg, the interrelation between
gamma and c is entirely different for initial and relaxed samples. In the
former case, strong defect-induced ordering upon approaching Tg is observed
while relaxed samples do not reveal any clear ordering/disordering. Possible
reasons for these observations are discussed. To further investigate the
relationship between the normalized FWHM and defect concentration, we performed
molecular dynamic simulation of gamma(c)-dependence in a high-entropy
FeNiCrCoCu model glass. It is found that gamma also linearly increases with c
while the derivative d(gamma)/dc is again close to unity just as in the case of
Pt-based glass.

<h3>A fermionic path integral for exact enumeration of polygons on the  simple cubic lattice</h3>

Enumerating polygons on regular lattices is a classic problem in rigorous
statistical mechanics. The goal of enumerating polygons on the square lattice
via fermionic path integration was achieved using a free-fermion quadratic
action in the late 1970s. Given that polygon edges only link 2 vertices, it is
commonly believed that an action of degree 2 in the Grassmann variables might
suffice to enumerate lattice polygons in any dimension. Nevertheless, on
nonplanar lattices the problem has remained open for more than four decades.
Here we derive the Grassmann action for exact enumeration of polygons on the
simple cubic lattice. Moreover, we prove that this action is not quadratic but
quartic -- corresponding to a model of interacting fermions.

Atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) is a standard tool to model the magnetization
dynamics of a variety of materials. The fundamental dynamical model underlying
ASD is entirely classical. In this letter, we present two approaches to
effectively incorporate quantum effects into ASD simulations, thus enhancing
their low temperature predictions. The first allows to simulate the magnetic
behavior of a quantum spin system by solving the equations of motions of a
classical spin system at an effective temperature. This effective temperature
is determined a priori from the microscopic properties of the system. The
second approach is based on a semi-classical model where classical spins
interact with an environment with a quantum-like power spectrum. The parameters
that characterize this model can be calculated ab initio or extracted from
experiments. This semi-classical model quantitatively reproduces the
low-temperature behavior of a magnetic system, thus accounting for the quantum
mechanical aspects of its dynamics. The methods presented here can be readily
implemented in current ASD simulations with no additional complexity cost.

The recent discovery of unconventional surface state pairs, which give rise
to Fermi arcs and spin textures, in antiferromagnetically ordered NdBi raised
the interest in rare-earth monopnictides. Several scenarios of
antiferromagnetic order have been suggested to explain the origin of these
states with some of them being consistent with the presence of non-trivial
topologies. In this study, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the
electronic structure of NdSb. We found the presence of distinct domains that
have different electronic structure at the surface. These domains correspond to
different orientations of magnetic moments in the AFM state with respect to the
surface. We demonstrated remarkable agreement between DFT calculations and
ARPES that capture all essential changes in the band structure caused by
transition to a magnetically ordered state.

The motivation to develop materials for quantum technologies has put
exploration of novel quantum states of matter at the focus of several research
fields, with particular efforts towards understanding and controlling the
behaviour of quantum entangled and other strongly interacting electronic
states. Experimental investigation is of primary importance, but requires
measurements at ultra-low temperatures where the quantum states of interest
have long lifetimes. Under these conditions, low energy interactions, such as
hyperfine or nuclear exchange interactions, become relevant, and can modify
electronic ground states and their associated excitations in multiple ways that
are not well understood or characterised. In this work, we use a recently
developed magnetic susceptibility technique, compatible with ultra-low
temperatures and high magnetic fields, to probe the influence of nuclear
interactions on superconducting and multipole ordered ground states in the
strongly correlated electron system PrOs4Sb12. We find that the multipole order
develops a novel, entangled nuclear-electronic character at the lowest
temperatures, which significantly modifies the phase boundary and leads to a
nuclear quantum critical point. In the superconducting phase, we find that
hyperfine interactions suppress superconductivity in a manner that provides
evidence for superconducting pairing mediated by crystal field excitations. Our
results on PrOs4Sb12 experimentally establish a new type of non-magnetic,
nuclear quantum critical point, and give revealing insight into a highly
unusual superconducting state. They also demonstrate more generally the
feasibility of exploiting hyperfine interactions as a tuning parameter for
experimental creation and investigation of a variety of quantum states and
phenomena in correlated electron materials.

We investigate the electronic properties of a graphene and $\alpha$-ruthenium
trichloride (hereafter RuCl$_3$) heterostructure, using a combination of
experimental and theoretical techniques. RuCl$_3$ is a Mott insulator and a
Kitaev material, and its combination with graphene has gained increasing
attention due to its potential applicability in novel electronic and
optoelectronic devices. By using a combination of spatially resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, low energy electron microscopy, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations we are able to provide a first direct
visualization of the massive charge transfer from graphene to RuCl$_3$, which
can modify the electronic properties of both materials, leading to novel
electronic phenomena at their interface. The electronic band structure is
compared to DFT calculations that confirm the occurrence of a Mott transition
for RuCl$_3$. Finally, a measurement of spatially resolved work function allows
for a direct estimate of the interface dipole between graphene and RuCl$_3$.
The strong coupling between graphene and RuCl$_3$ could lead to new ways of
manipulating electronic properties of two-dimensional lateral heterojunction.
Understanding the electronic properties of this structure is pivotal for
designing next generation low-power opto-electronics devices.
