<h3>Einstein relation for subdiffusive relaxation in Stark chains</h3>

<p>We investigate chains of interacting spinless fermions subject to a finite
external field $F$ (also called Stark chains) and focus on the regime where the
charge thermalization follows the subdiffusive hydrodynamics. First, we study
reduced models conserving the dipole moment and derive an explicit Einstein
relation which links the subdiffusive transport coefficient with the
correlations of the dipolar current. This relation explains why the decay rate,
$\Gamma_q$, of the density modulation with wave-vector $q$ shows
$q^4$-dependence. In the case of the Stark model, a similar Einstein relation
is also derived and tested using various numerical methods. They confirm an
exponential reduction of the transport coefficient with increasing $F$. On the
other hand, our study of the Stark model indicates that upon increasing $q$
there is a crossover from subdiffusive behavior, $\Gamma_q \propto q^4$, to the
normal diffusive relaxation, $\Gamma_q \propto q^2$, at the wave vector $q^*$
which vanishes for $F \to 0$.

<h3>Sounds waves and fluctuations in one-dimensional supersolids</h3>

<p>We examine the low-energy excitations of a dilute supersolid state of matter
with a one-dimensional crystal structure. A hydrodynamic description is
developed based on a Lagrangian, incorporating generalized elastic parameters
derived from ground state calculations. The predictions of the hydrodynamic
theory are validated against solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations,
by comparing the speeds of sound, density fluctuations, and phase fluctuations
of the two gapless bands. Our results are presented for two distinct supersolid
models: a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate in an infinite tube and a dilute
Bose gas of atoms with soft-core interactions. Characteristic energy scales are
identified, highlighting that these two models approximately realize the bulk
incompressible and rigid lattice supersolid limits.

<h3>Capillary-lubrication force between rotating cylinders separated by a  fluid interface</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19241" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19241</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aditya Jha, Yacine Amarouchene, Thomas Salez</i>
<p>Two cylinders rotating next to each other generate a large hydrodynamic force
if the intermediate space is filled with a viscous fluid. Herein, we explore
the case where the cylinders are separated by two layers of viscous immiscible
fluids, in the limit of small capillary deformation of the fluid interface. As
the interface deformation breaks the system's symmetry, a novel force
characteristic of soft lubrication is generated. We calculate this
capillary-lubrication force, which is split into velocity-dependant and
acceleration-dependant contributions. Furthermore, we analyze the variations
induced by modifying the viscosity ratio between the two fluid layers, their
thickness ratio, and the Bond number. Unlike standard elastic cases, where a
repelling soft-lubrication lift force has been abundantly reported, the current
fluid bilayer setting can also exhibit an attractive force due to the
non-monotonic deflection of the fluid interface when varying the sublayer
thickness. Besides, at high Bond numbers, the system's response becomes
analogous to the one of a Winkler-like substrate with a viscous flow inside.

<h3>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active  repulsive mixtures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19291" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19291</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kim L. Kreienkamp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</i>
<p>Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature in many biological and synthetic active
matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. In addition to
conservative interactions between active constituents, a non-equilibrium
environment often induces effective non-reciprocal (NR) couplings. The full
consequences, especially for systems with order parameters of different
symmetries, still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active NR mixture
exhibiting both, polar ordering and clustering using a combination of
hydrodynamic theory, linear stability analysis, particle-based simulations and
fluctuation analysis. We show that NR alignment interactions have profound
influence on the density dynamics already far below the threshold related to
spontaneous time dependency of polarization dynamics. In particular, NR
alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering, and thus, partial demixing
with single-species clusters chasing more dilute accumulations of the other
species. Extremely large NR alignment eventually leads to a disappearance of
clustered states.

<h3>(2+1)D topological phases with RT symmetry: many-body invariant,  classification, and higher order edge modes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18887</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ryohei Kobayashi, Yuxuan Zhang, Yan-Qi Wang, Maissam Barkeshli</i>
<p>It is common in condensed matter systems for reflection ($R$) and
time-reversal ($T$) symmetry to both be broken while the combination $RT$ is
preserved. In this paper we study invariants that arise due to $RT$ symmetry.
We consider many-body systems of interacting fermions with fermionic symmetry
groups $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, $U(1)^f \rtimes
\mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, and $U(1)^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$. We show that (2+1)D
invertible fermionic topological phases with these symmetries have a
$\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_8$, $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and
$\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ classification, respectively, which we
compute using the framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories. We
provide a many-body $RT$ invariant in terms of a tripartite entanglement
measure, and which we show can be understood using an edge conformal field
theory computation in terms of vertex states. For $G_f = U(1)^f \rtimes
\mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, which applies to charged fermions in a magnetic field, the
non-trivial value of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires strong interactions.
For symmetry-preserving boundaries, the phases are distinguished by zero modes
at the intersection of the reflection axis and the boundary. Additional
invariants arise in the presence of translation or rotation symmetry.

<h3>Strong-coupling approach to temperature dependence of competing orders  of superconductivity: Possible time-reversal symmetry breaking and nontrivial  topology</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18897" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18897</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chi Sun, Kristian Mæland, Even Thingstad, Asle Sudbø</i>
<p>We use strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to study the competition of separate
superconducting orders at low temperatures. Specifically, we study
magnon-mediated superconductivity in a trilayer heterostructure with a thin
normal metal between two antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin-triplet $p$-wave,
spin-triplet $f$-wave, and spin-singlet $d$-wave superconducting gaps have been
predicted to occur close to the critical temperature for the superconducting
instability. The gap symmetry with the largest critical temperature depends on
parameters in the model. We confirm that the same gap symmetries appear at any
temperature below the critical temperature. Furthermore, we show that the
temperature can affect the competition between the different superconducting
orders. In addition, we consider time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, complex
linear combinations of candidate pairings, such as chiral $p$-, $f$-, and
$d$-wave gaps, as well as $p_x+if_y$-wave gaps. We find indications that some
of these time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, nodeless gaps offer a greater
condensation energy than the time-reversal symmetric gaps. This indicates that
superconducting states with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and
nontrivial topology may be preferred in this system.

<h3>Theory of moiré magnetism and multi-domain spin textures in twisted  Mott insulator - semimetal heterobilayers</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M. A. Keskiner, Pouyan Ghaemi, M. Ö. Oktel, Onur Erten</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent experimental developments in van der Waals
heterostructures, we investigate the emergent magnetism in Mott insulator -
semimetal moir\'e superlattices by deriving effective spin models and exploring
their phase diagram by Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis indicates that the
stacking-dependent interlayer Kondo interaction can give rise to different
types of magnetic order, forming domains within the moir\'e unit cell. In
particular, we find that the AB (AA) stacking regions tend to order
(anti)ferromagnetically for an extended range of parameters. The remaining
parts of the moir\'e unit cell form ferromagnetic chains that are coupled
antiferromagnetically. We show that the decay length of the Kondo interaction
can control the extent of these phases. Our results highlight the importance of
stacking-dependent interlayer exchange and the rich magnetic spin textures that
can be obtained in van der Waals heterostructures.

<p>The intimate correlation between the local atomic arrangement and electronic
states in Li-ion battery cathode materials plays a crucial role in determining
their electrochemical properties, including capacity, cycling stability, and
rate capability. Despite almost 30 years of research efforts on high
performance cathodes based on Ni rich layered oxides, there is still no
consensus on LiNiO2 local atomic and electronic structure. Ni sites could be
either Jahn-Teller distorted or bond disproportionated and the role of Ni and
oxygen in the charge compensation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we
compare the local and electronic structure of LiNiO2 and NaNiO2, a long-range
Jahn-Teller system, using a novel approach which aims at correlating the
results from bulk spectroscopy techniques, particularly under operando
conditions, obtained on standard samples to ensure sample interoperability and
enhance the reliability and robustness of our results. Despite being a
site-selective and local technique, XAS is unable to discriminate between the
proposed scenarios, as confirmed also by theoretical calculations. On the
contrary, Raman spectroscopy show local structural differences between
monoclinic distorted NaNiO2 and rhombohedral LiNiO2. Additionally, HAXPES
confirms the presence of multiple formal oxidation states for Ni, and RIXS data
provides evidence of 3d8 states, confirming the negative charge transfer
character of Ni and some degree of bond disproportionation in LiNiO2. Regarding
the charge compensation mechanism, XRS and RIXS support the participation of
oxygen holes in the redox activity, while Raman spectroscopy does not detect
molecular oxygen. By combing several high-fidelity spectroscopy datasets, this
study shows the value of correlative characterization workflows to provide
insights into complex structural-electrochemical relationships.

<h3>Chirality-Induced Magnet-Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</h3>

<p>Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in
semiconductors are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information
science. While spin generation in semiconductors has been frequently realized
via electrical injection from a ferromagnet, there are significant advantages
in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway
exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures
or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), we
demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n-doped GaAs via
electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a
self-assembled monolayer of chiral molecules ({\alpha}-helix L-polyalanine,
AHPA-L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the
n-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature
and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The
experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic
device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation
in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the
physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free
semiconductor spintronics.

</p><i>Anna S. Bodrova</i>
<p>We investigate the granular temperatures in force-free granular gases under
exponential resetting. When a resetting event occurs, the granular temperature
attains its initial value, while between the resetting events it cools down. We
show that the granular system attains a non-equilibrium steady state value and
study the dependence of average granular temperature on the resetting rate. Our
theory may help to explain the behavior of non-periodically driven granular
systems.

<p>The search for anyons, quasiparticles with fractional charge and exotic
exchange statistics, has inspired decades of condensed matter research. Quantum
Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase via
discrete interference phase jumps when the quasiparticle number changes. Here,
we observe the universal anyonic braiding phase in both the $\nu = 1/3$ and
$4/3$ fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph
noise (RTN) in real-time. We find that the observed RTN stems from anyon
quasiparticle number $n$ fluctuations and reconstruct three Aharonov-Bohm
oscillation signals phase shifted by $2\pi/3$, corresponding to the three
possible interference branches from braiding around $n$ (mod 3) anyons. Hence,
we fully characterize the anyon exchange statistics using new methods that can
readily extend to non-abelian states.

<h3>Reconfigurable multiplex setup for high throughput electrical  characterisation at cryogenic temperature</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18987" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18987</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xinya Bian, Hannah J Joyce, Charles G Smith, Michael J Kelly, G Andrew D Briggs, Jan A Mol</i>
<p>In this paper, we present a reconfigurable multiplex (MUX) setup that
increases the throughput of electrical characterisation at cryogenic
temperature. The setup separates the MUX circuitry from quantum device under
test (qDUT), allowing qDUT chips to be exchanged easily and MUX chips to be
reused. To interface with different types of qDUTs, board-level designs are
incorporated to allow interconnects flexibly routed into different topology.
MUXs are built based on a multiple level selective gating (MLSG) scheme, where
the number of multiplexed output channels (interconnects) is exponentially
dependent on the number of control lines. In the prototype setup presented in
this paper, with 14 out of 44 existing wires from room temperature, 4 MUXs at
cryogenic temperature can supply in total 128 interconnects to interface with
qDUTs. We validate the MUX setup operation and assess the various limits
existed by measuring k$\Omega$ resistors made of $\mu$m-size graphene ribbons.
We further demonstrate the setup by performing charge transport measurement on
128 nm-size graphene quantum devices in a single cooling down.

<h3>The bending rigidity exponent of a two-dimensional crystalline membrane  with arbitrary number of flexural phonon modes</h3>

<br>
</p><i>D. A. Ivanov, A. Kudlis, I. S. Burmistrov</i>
<p>We investigate the elastic behavior of two-dimensional crystalline membrane
embedded into real space taking into account the presence an arbitrary number
of flexural phonon modes $d_c$ (the number of out-of-plane deformation field
components). The bending rigidity exponent $\eta$ is extracted by numerical
simulation via Fourier Monte Carlo technique of the system behaviour in the
universal regime. This universal quantity governess the correlation function of
out-of-plane deformations at long wavelengths and defines the behaviour of
renormalized bending rigidity at small momentum $\varkappa~\sim~1/q^{\eta}$.
The resulting numerical estimates of the exponent for various $d_c$ are
compared with the numbers obtained from the approximate analytical techniques.

<p>EuSn$_2$As$_2$ is a trigonal A-type antiferromagnetic topological insulator
with the moments aligned in the $ab$ plane and with a N\'eel temperature
$T_{\rm N} = 23.5$ K. Here we report that an EuSn$_2$As$_2$ crystal exhibits a
broad peak at $H_{\rm c1} = 1100$ Oe in the field derivative $dM_{ab}/dH$ of
the $ab$-plane magnetization $M_{ab}(H)$ at temperature $T=2$ K, demonstrating
the presence of trigonal antiferromagnetic domains. We model these
$M_{ab}(H,\,T=2\,{\rm K})$ data and obtain the trigonal anisotropy-energy
coefficient $K_3$ that is 13.3 and 3.7 times larger than those we previously
reported for single crystals of the trigonal compounds EuMg$_2$Sb$_2$ and
EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$, respectively.

<p>In this paper, we examine the electron interaction within tilted anisotropic
Dirac materials when subjected to external electric and magnetic fields
possessing translational symmetry. Specifically, we focus on a distinct
non-zero electric field magnitude, enabling the separation of the differential
equation system inherent in the eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, employing
supersymmetric quantum mechanics facilitates the determination of eigenstates
and eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian operator. To delve into a
semi-classical analysis of the system, we identify a set of coherent states.
Finally, we assess the characteristics of these states using fidelity and the
phase-space representation through the Wigner function.

<p>Finite depth quantum circuits provide an equivalence relation between gapped
phases. Moreover, there can be nontrivial domain walls either within the same
gapped phase or between different gapped phases, whose equivalence relations
are given by finite depth quantum circuits in one lower dimension. In this
paper, we use such unitary equivalence relations to study the fusion of
one-dimensional gapped phases. In particular, we use finite depth circuits to
fuse two gapped phases, local unitaries to fuse two domain walls, and a
combination of both to fuse gapped phases with domain walls. This provides a
concrete illustration of some simple aspects of the `higher-category' structure
of gapped defects in a higher-dimensional trivial gapped bulk state.

<p>Assembly of dissimilar metals can be achieved by different methods, for
example, casting, welding, and additive manufacturing (AM). However, undesired
phases formed in liquid-phase assembling processes due to solute segregation
during solidification diminish mechanical and other properties of the processed
parts. In the present work, an open-source software named MaterialsMap, has
been developed based on the CALculation of Phase Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach.
The primary objective of MaterialsMap is to facilitate the design of an optimal
composition pathway for assembling dissimilar alloys with liquid-phases based
on the formation of desired and undesired phases along the pathway. In
MaterialsMap, equilibrium thermodynamic calculations are used to predict
equilibrium phases formed at slow cooling rate, while Scheil-Gulliver
simulations are employed to predict non-equilibrium phases formed during rapid
cooling. By combining these two simulations, MaterialsMap offers a thorough
guide for understanding phase formation in various manufacturing processes,
assisting users in making informed decisions during material selection and
production. As a demonstration of this approach, a compositional pathway was
designed from pure Al to pure Cu through Ag using MaterialsMap. The design was
experimentally verified using resistance spot welding (RSW).

<h3>A generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</h3>

</p><i>Wei Jia</i>
<p>Fermi sea can host exotic quantum topology, which determines the conductance
quantization in metals and is characterized by the Euler characteristic
$\chi_F$. Here, we propose a generic reduction theory for the Fermi sea
topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be
identified by the feature of reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with
theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a
striking connection between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band
topology, in which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of the
gapped topological phases by using an ingenious mapping. This nontrivial result
provides a potential method to probe $\chi_F$ through $\mathbb{Z}$-classified
topological superconductors and further paves the way for studying the Fermi
sea topology via the gapped topological systems. Our work promotes a deep
understanding and simple detection for $\chi_F$, which shall facilitate the
discovery of other novel physical effects caused by the Fermi sea topology in
the future.

<h3>Glassy Dynamics in a Molecular Liquid</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19141</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shubham Kumar, Sarmistha Sarkar, Biman Bagchi</i>
<p>A universal dynamical crossover temperature, Tcr, in glassy liquids,
associated with the {\alpha}-\b{eta} bifurcation temperature, TB, has been
observed in dielectric spectroscopy and other experiments. Tcr lies
significantly above the glass transition temperature. Here, we introduce a new
class of glass-forming liquids, binary mixtures of prolate and oblate
ellipsoids. This model system exhibits sharp thermodynamic and dynamic
anomalies, such as the specific heat jump during heating and a sharp variation
in the thermal expansion coefficient around a temperature identified as the
glass transition temperature, Tg. The same temperature is obtained from the fit
of the calculated relaxation times to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) form. As
the temperature is lowered, the single peak rotational relaxation spectrum
splits into two at a temperature TB significantly above the estimated Tg.
Similar bifurcation is also observed in the distribution of
short-to-intermediate time translational diffusion. Interrogation of the two
peaks reveals a lower extent of dynamic heterogeneity in the population of the
faster mode. We observe an unexpected appearance of a sharp peak in the product
of rotational relaxation time {\tau}2 and diffusion constant D at a temperature
Tcr, close to TB, but above the glass transition temperature. Additionally, we
coarse-grain the system into cubic boxes, each containing, on average, ~62
particles, to study the average dynamical properties. Clear evidence of
large-scale sudden changes in the diffusion coefficient and rotational
correlation time signals first-order transitions between low and high-mobility
domains.

<h3>First Landau Level Physics in Second Moiré Band of $2.1^\circ$ Twisted  Bilayer MoTe${}_2$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Cheong-Eung Ahn, Wonjun Lee, Kunihiro Yananose, Youngwook Kim, Gil Young Cho</i>
<p>The recent experimental discovery of the fractional quantum spin Hall effect
in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a twist angle of 2.1 degrees highlights the
unique properties of its second moir\'e band. Inspired by this finding, we
conduct a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the half-filled second
moir\'e band at this angle, utilizing an effective continuum model. Our
analysis reveals that the band not only exhibits characteristics akin to the
first Landau level,
$K=\int_\mathrm{BZ}\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{k}\:\mathrm{tr}\:\eta(\mathbf{k})
\approx 3$, but also that its projected Coulomb interaction strikingly mirrors
the Haldane pseudopotentials of the first Landau level. They together strongly
indicate the potential emergence of a non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous
Hall state at the half-filling under the Coulomb interactions. By performing
exact diagonalization calculations, we validate this hypothesis and construct a
global phase diagram around this non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall
states. We also introduce a novel metric of 1LL-ness of a band, which
quantitatively measures the alignment of the projected Coulomb interaction with
the Haldane pseudopotentials in Landau levels. This metric is then compared
with the global phase diagram including the non-Abelian fractional quantum
anomalous Hall state, revealing its utility in predicting the parameter region
of the 1LL-ness. Finally, we discuss the potential implications on experiments.

<p>Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural
science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently
solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a
given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of
near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with
additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due
to difficulties in handling the constraints. The performance of Ising machines
on such problems heavily depends on encoding methods of constraints into
penalties, but the optimal choice is non-trivial. In this work, we focus on
benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring
out their practical performance, we propose to exploit the problem structure
upon using Ising machines. Specifically, we apply fast two-stage
post-processing to the outputs of Ising machines, which makes handling the
constraint easier. Simulation on medium-sized test instances shows that the
proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising
machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of the encoding methods. We
evaluate an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine with the proposed
method and found that it achieves comparable results with existing heuristics.

<p>We grew (Hg,Re)Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+{\delta} ((Hg,Re)1223) single crystals with good
reproducibility via the single-step flux method using monoxides as raw
materials. A double-sealing method using a thick-walled quartz tube and a
stainless-steel container was adopted for explosion protection. The maximum
crystal size was approximately 1 mm x 1 mm in the ab plane and 0.04 mm in
thickness. The crystal was square-shaped, reflecting the tetragonal crystal
structure of (Hg,Re)1223. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated a
critical temperature of 130 K. The in-plane resistivity exhibited a linear
temperature dependence, indicating that the sample was close to optimal doping
level. The out-of-plane resistivity was also measured, and the anisotropy
parameter was 250-650 at 300 K.

<p>Excitons, or bound electron-hole pairs, play a crucial role in the optical
response of monolayer, 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). They
hold significant promise for the development of novel quantum opto-electronic
devices due to their large binding energies and strong spin-orbit coupling.
Among the monolayer TMDs, MoTe2 stands out because of its bandgap in the
near-infrared (NIR) regime. Here, we report the experimental observation of NIR
Rydberg excitons and conduction band-split charged excitons, in high-quality,
boron nitride (BN)-encapsulated monolayer MoTe2 devices, probed by
photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectroscopy. By employing a graphite
bottom gate, we successfully modulate the emission intensity of various
excitonic species. Additionally, our device fabrication process within an
argon-filled glove box ensures clean TMD/metal electrode interfaces, enabling
the construction of p-n junctions near the electrodes. Our work significantly
advances our understanding of excitons in monolayer TMDs and contributes to the
application of MoTe2 in NIR quantum opto-electronic devices.

<h3>Prediction and identification of point defect fingerprints in the X-ray  photoelectron spectra of TiN$_x$</h3>

<p>We investigate the effect of selected N and Ti point defects in $B$1 TiN on N
1s and Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ binding energies (BE) by experiments and ab initio
calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of
Ti-deficient TiN films reveal additional N 1s spectral components at lower
binding energies. Ab initio calculations predict that these components are
caused by either Ti vacancies, which induce a N 1s BE shift of $-0.53$ eV in
its first N neighbors, and/or N tetrahedral interstitials, which have their N
1s BE shifted by $-1.18$ eV and also shift BE of their first N neighbors by
$-0.53$ eV. However, the {\it ab initio} calculations also reveal that the
tetrahedral N interstitial is unstable at room temperature. We, therefore,
unambiguously attribute the detected signal to Ti vacancies. Furthermore, the
vacancy concentration in Ti-deficient TiN was quantified with XPS supported by
ab initio calculations. The largest BE shifts of $-1.53$, $-1.80$ and $-2.28$
eV for Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ electrons are predicted for the Ti tetrahedral, split
(10$\overline{1}$)-aligned and split (111)-aligned interstitial atoms,
respectively, and we, therefore, propose XPS could detect them. Other defects
such as N vacancy or N split (10$\overline{1}$)-aligned interstitial introduce
smaller N 1s and Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ BE shifts and are unlikely to be detectable
experimentally. Our work highlights the potential of ab initio-guided XPS
measurements in detecting and quantifying point defects in $B$1 TiN.

<p>We investigate phase coexistence in a weakly stochastic reaction-diffusion
system without assuming a continuum description. Concretely, for $(2N+1)$
diffusion-coupled vessels in which a chemical reaction exhibiting bistability
occurs, we derive a condition for the phase coexistence in the limit $N \to
\infty$. We then find that the phase coexistence condition depends on the rate
of hopping between neighboring vessels. The conditions in the high- and
low-hopping-rate limits are expressed in terms of two different potentials
which are determined from the chemical reaction model in a single vessel.

</p><i>Giordano Mattoni, Kazumi Fukushima, Shingo Yonezawa, Fumihiko Nakamura, Yoshiteru Maeno</i>
<p>An appealing direction to change the properties of strongly correlated
materials is to induce nonequilibrium steady states by the application of a
direct current. While access to these novel states is of high scientific
interest, Joule heating due to current flow often constitutes a hurdle to
identify nonthermal effects. The biggest challenge usually resides in measuring
accurately the temperature of a sample subjected to direct current, and to use
probes that give direct information of the material. In this work, we exploit
the simultaneous measurement of electrical transport and magnetisation to probe
non-equilibrium steady states in Ca2RuO4. In order to reveal non-thermal
current-induced effects, we employ a simple model of Joule self-heating to
remove the effects of heating and discuss the importance of temperature
inhomogeneity within the sample. Our approach provides a solid basis for
investigating current-induced phenomena in highly resistive materials.

<p>A newly identified magnetic phase called altermagnet is being actively
studied because of its unprecedented spin-dependent phenomena. Among the
candidate materials, CrSb has a particularly high transition temperature and a
large spin-splitting energy, but its transport properties have remained
unexplored. In this study, we report the magnetotransport properties of CrSb
measured on single crystals. We found that the Hall resistivity shows a
nonlinear dependence on the magnetic field at low temperatures. From
symmetry-based considerations, however, this behavior can not be attributed to
an anomalous Hall effect, but to a multicarrier effect. A multicarrier fitting
to the in-plane conductivity tensor revealed that there are carriers with high
mobilities in CrSb, probably because of the presence of Weyl points in the
electronic structure.

<p>Understanding the thermoelastic response of a nanostructure is crucial for
the choice of materials and interfaces in electronic devices with improved and
tailored transport properties, at the length scales of the present technology.
Here we show how the deposition of a $MoS_2$ monolayer can strongly modify the
nanoscale thermoelastic dynamics of silicon substrates close to their
interface. We achieve this result by creating a transient grating with extreme
ultraviolet light, using ultrashort free-electron laser pulses, whose
$\approx$84 nm period is comparable to the size of elements typically used in
nanodevices, such as electric contacts and nanowires. The thermoelastic
response, featured by coherent acoustic waves and an incoherent relaxation, is
tangibly modified by the presence of monolayer $MoS_2$. Namely, we observed a
major reduction of the amplitude of the surface mode, which is almost
suppressed, while the longitudinal mode is basically unperturbed, aside from a
faster decay of the acoustic modulations. We interpret this behavior as a
selective modification of the surface elasticity and we discuss the conditions
to observe such effect, which might be of immediate relevance for the design of
Si-based nanoscale devices.

<h3>Finite-time Scaling beyond the Kibble-Zurek Prerequisite: Driven  Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhi Zeng, Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi-Xuan Li, Zi-Xiang Li, Shuai Yin</i>
<p>In conventional quantum critical point (QCP) characterized by order parameter
fluctuations, the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time
scaling (FTS) theory provide universal descriptions of the driven critical
dynamics. However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless
fermions are usually present in vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely
been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in
two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases
separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless
Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of
physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum
Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the
FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by
relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating
gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and
FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective
into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel
theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic
systems.

<h3>Influence of disorder at Insulator-Metal interface on spin transport</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mahsa Seyed Heydari, Wolfgang Belzig, Niklas Rohling</i>
<p>Motivated by experimental work showing enhancement of spin transport between
Yttrium Iron Garnet and Platinum by a thin antiferromagnetic insulator between
them, we consider spin transport through the interface of a non-magnetic metal
and compensated antiferromagnetically ordered insulator and focus on the
significance of the interface itself. The spin transport is carried by
spin-polarized electrons in the metal and by magnons in the insulator. We
compute the spin current in the presence of a spin accumulation in the metal,
cause by the spin Hall effect, and a thermal gradient using Fermi's Golden Rule
in the presence of interfacial disorder. For a perfectly clean interface, the
in-plane momentum is conserved by the electron-magnon scattering events that
govern the spin transport through the interface. We calculate how
disorder-induced broadening of scattering matrix elements with respect to the
in-plane momentum influences the spin current. As a general result, we observe
that for many experimental setups, specifically for high temperatures, one
should expect a rather small effect of interface disorder on the measured spin
current, while for small temperatures there is a significant reduction of a
spin current with increasing disorder.

<h3>Transport effects of twist-angle disorder in mesoscopic twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Aleksander Sanjuan Ciepielewski, Jakub Tworzydło, Timo Hyart, Alexander Lau</i>
<p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is a tunable material with remarkably
flat energy bands near the Fermi level, leading to fascinating transport
properties and correlated states at low temperatures. However, grown pristine
samples of this material tend to break up into landscapes of twist-angle
domains, strongly influencing the physical properties of each individual
sample. This poses a significant problem to the interpretation and comparison
between measurements obtained from different samples. In this work, we study
numerically the effects of twist-angle disorder on quantum electron transport
in mesoscopic samples of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We find a
significant property of twist-angle disorder that distinguishes it from
onsite-energy disorder: it leads to an asymmetric broadening of the
energy-resolved conductance. The magnitude of the twist-angle variation has a
strong effect on conductance, while the number of twist-angle domains is of
much lesser significance. We further establish a relationship between the
asymmetric broadening and the asymmetric density of states of twisted bilayer
graphene at angles smaller than the first magic angle. Our results show that
the qualitative differences between the types of disorder in the
energy-resolved conductance of twisted bilayer graphene samples can be used to
characterize them at temperatures above the critical temperatures of the
correlated phases, enabling systematic experimental studies of the effects of
the different types of disorders also on the other properties such as the
competition of the different types of correlated states appearing at lower
temperatures.

<h3>Origin of multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Weyl semi-metal RhSi</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Krishnendu Patra, Viktor Christiansson, Ferdi Aryasetiawan, Priya Mahadevan</i>
<p>It is known from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that RhSi has a
multifold degenerate Dirac point at the Fermi energy, with the dominant states
in the low-energy region displaying mostly Rh $d$ character. Using DFT+U, we
calculate the band structure by considering an effective local interaction on
the Rh $d$ states, with a realistic effective Hubbard $U_\textrm{eff}=2.5$ eV
derived from a constrained random-phase approximation calculation, and find the
emergence of a double hump structure close to the Fermi energy.By further
deriving a low-energy tight-binding model from our first-principles results, we
show that the double hump is a direct consequence of a competition between the
Rh $d$-Rh $d$ and Rh $d$-Si $p$ interactions, which differ in their momentum
dependence. As a consequence, through an artificial tuning of the energy level
of the Si $p$ orbitals this hump structure can be suppressed due to the
effectively reduced Rh $d$ -Si $p$ interaction.This peculiar low-energy
electronic structure additionally results in that a small hole/electron doping
($\sim$ 0.1 $\%$) can tune the Fermi surface topology, going from closed to
open Fermi surfaces, which has dramatic consequences for the thermal transport.

<p>The electronic properties of one- and two-dimensional biphenylene-based
systems, such as nanoribbons and bilayers, are studied within a unified
approach. Besides the bilayer with direct (AA) stacking, we present two
additional symmetric stackings for bilayer biphenylene that we denote by AB, by
analogy with bilayer graphene, and AX, which can be derived by a small
translation (slip) from the AA bilayer, with distinct band structures. We
combine first-principles calculations with a tight-binding model to provide a
realistic effective description of these structures. Our approach provides a
global framework to characterize and analyze the robustness of the type-II
Dirac cone within these structures, captures the variations caused by different
stackings, and highlights important symmetries inherent in the biphenylene
nanoribbon Dirac cones and edge states.

<br>
</p><i>Felipe Lopes Oliveira, Binquan Luan, Pierre Mothé Esteves, Mathias Steiner, Rodrigo Neumann Barros Ferreira</i>
<p>Automated molecular simulations are used extensively for predicting material
properties. Typically, these simulations exhibit two regimes: a dynamic
equilibration part, followed by a steady state. For extracting observable
properties, the simulations must first reach a steady state so that
thermodynamic averages can be taken. However, as equilibration depends on
simulation conditions, predicting the optimal number of simulation steps a
priori is impossible. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Marginal
Standard Error Rule (MSER) for automatically identifying the optimal truncation
point in Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. This novel automatic
procedure determines the point in which steady state is reached, ensuring that
figures-of-merits are extracted in an objective, accurate, and reproducible
fashion. In the case of GCMC simulations of gas adsorption in metal-organic
frameworks, we find that this methodology reduces the computational cost by up
to 90%. As MSER statistics are independent of the simulation method that
creates the data, this library is, in principle, applicable to any time series
analysis in which equilibration truncation is required. The open-source Python
implementation of our method, pyMSER, is publicly available for reuse and
validation at https://github.com/IBM/pymser.

<h3>Memory signatures in path curvature of self-avoidant model particles are  revealed by time delayed self mutual information</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Katherine Daftari, Katherine Newhall</i>
<p>Emergent behavior in active systems is a complex byproduct of local, often
pairwise, interactions. One such interaction is self-avoidance, which
experimentally can arise as a response to self-generated environmental signals;
such experiments have inspired non-Markovian mathematical models. In previous
work, we set out to find ``hallmarks of self-avoidant memory" in a particle
model for environmentally responsive swimming droplets. In our analysis, we
found that transient self-trapping was a spatial hallmark of the particle's
self-avoidant memory response. The self-trapping results from the combined
effects of behaviors at multiple scales: random reorientations, which occur on
the diffusion scale, and the self-avoidant memory response, which occurs on the
ballistic (and longer) timescales. In this work, we use the path curvature as
it encodes the self-trapping response to estimate an ``effective memory
lifetime" by analyzing the decay of its time-delayed mutual information and
subsequently determining the longevity of significant nonlinear correlations.
This effective memory lifetime (EML) is longer in systems where the curvature
is a product of both self-avoidance and random reorientations as compared to
systems without self-avoidance.

<p>Magnetic materials are composed of the simple building blocks of magnetic
moments on a crystal lattice that interact via short-range magnetic exchange
interactions. Yet from these simple building blocks emerges a remarkable
diversity of magnetic states. Some of these, such as ferromagnetism, are
familiar in our everyday lives, while others reveal the deep quantum mechanical
origins of magnetism. A prime example of the latter are quantum spin liquid
(QSL) states in which -- unlike in a ferromagnet where magnetic moments are
driven by their exchange interactions to adopt long-range order -- magnetic
moments remain disordered at low temperatures but are simultaneously correlated
over long length scales through quantum entanglement. A particularly promising
theoretical model of a QSL is the Kitaev model, composed of unusual
bond-dependent exchange interactions between magnetic moments on a honeycomb
lattice. However, the Kitaev QSL is extremely challenging to realise
experimentally as it is unstable to competing exchange interactions and crystal
lattice perturbations that inevitably arise in real materials. This makes it
essential to understand the relationship between the structure and interactions
that may give rise to Kitaev interactions in new candidate materials. Here we
show that the material requirements for the Kitaev QSL survive for an extended
pseudo-edge-sharing superexchange pathway of Ru3+ 4d5 octahedra within the
honeycomb layers of the inorganic framework solid, RuP3SiO11. Through materials
synthesis and structural characterisation, resonant inelastic X-ray and neutron
scattering experiments, we confirm the requisite jeff = 1/2 state of Ru3+ in
RuP3SiO11 and resolve the hierarchy of exchange interactions that provide
experimental access to an otherwise unexplored region of the extended Kitaev

<p>The thermal conductivity of heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ was
measured with a magnetic field rotating in the tetragonal a-b plane, with the
heat current in the anti-nodal direction, $J$ || [100]. We observe a sharp
resonance in thermal conductivity for the magnetic field at an angle $\theta$
$\sim$ 12$^{\circ}$, measured from the heat current direction [100]. This
resonance corresponds to the reported resonance at an angle $\theta'$ $\sim$
33$^{\circ}$ from the direction of the heat current applied along the nodal
direction, $J$ || [110]. Both resonances, therefore, occur when the magnetic
field is applied in the same crystallographic orientation in the two
experiments, regardless of the direction of the heat current, proving
conclusively that these resonances are due to the structure of the Fermi
surface of CeCoIn$_5$. We argue that the uncondensed Landau quasiparticles,
emerging with field, are responsible for the observed resonance. We support our
experimental results with density-functional-theory model calculations of the
density of states in a rotating magnetic field. Our calculations, using a model
Fermi surface of CeCoIn$_5$, reveal several sharp peaks as a function of the
field direction. Our study demonstrates that the thermal-conductivity
measurement in rotating magnetic field can probe the normal parts of the Fermi
surface deep inside the superconducting state.

<p>The electronic transport properties of two junctions (BGB, GBG) made of
borophene (B) and graphene (G) are studied. Using the transfer matrix method
with Chebyshev polynomials, we have studied single and multiple barriers in a
superlattice configuration. We showed that a single barrier exhibits remarkable
tilted transport properties, with perfect transmission observed for both
junctions under normal incidence. We found that robust superlattice
transmission is maintained for multiple barriers, particularly in the BGB
junction. It turns out that by varying the incident energy, many gaps appear in
the transmission probability. The number, width, and position of these
transmission gaps can be manipulated by adjusting the number of cells, incident
angle, and barrier characteristics. For diffuse transport, we observed
significant variations in conductance and the Fano factor, highlighting the
sensitivity of these junctions to the physical parameters. We showed different
behaviors between BGB and GBG junctions, particularly with respect to the
response of conductance and Fano factor when barrier height varies. For
ballistic transport, we have seen that the minimum conductivity is related to
the maximum Fano factor, demonstrating their control under specific conditions
of the physical parameters. Analysis of the length ratio (geometric factor)
revealed some remarkable patterns, where conductivity and the Fano factor
converged to certain values as the ratio approached infinity.

<h3>Coexistence of non-Hermitian skin effect and extended states in  one-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Han Xiao, Qi-Bo Zeng</i>
<p>We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with staggered onsite
modulations and nonreciprocal hopping up to the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN)
sites. Due to the NNN nonreciprocity, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in
the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) can be energy-dependent, and
there will be NHSE edges in the eigenenergy spectrum, which separates the
eigenstates localized at the opposite ends of the lattice. We find that the
interplay between the nonreciprocal hopping and onsite modulations can reverse
the direction of the skin effect and modify the position of the NHSE edge.
Moreover, by tuning the system parameters, some of the eigenstates under OBC
will become fully extended with the corresponding eigenenergies being imaginary
under both open and periodic boundary conditions. Thus, the extended states can
coexist with the NHSH in the same system. The NHSE can even be completely
dissolved with all the eigenstates being extended when the modulation is
imaginary. Our work unveils the intricate interplay between onsite modulations
and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.

<p>Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for
their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several
mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing,
asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent
diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of
a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal
$1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it
from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is
shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the
supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological
spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the
junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two
harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a
magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence
between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in
$1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an
ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also
enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson
junctions.

<p>Magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) of Hall coefficient are measured in
rare-earth tritelluride TmTe$_{3}$ and shown to be much stronger and persist to
higher temperature than the Shubnikov oscillations. It is general for MQO in
strongly anisotropic metals, and the combined measurements of Hall and diagonal
magnetoresistance provide useful informations about the electronic structure.
The ratio of their MQO amplitudes depends linearly on magnetic field, and its
slope gives a simple and accurate measurement tool of the electron mean free
time and its temperature dependence.

<h3>Dynamic interaction between chiral currents and surface waves in  topological superfluids: a pathway to detect Majorana fermions?</h3>

<p>Despite extensive experimental efforts over the past two decades, the quest
for Majorana fermions in superconductors remains inconclusive. We propose an
experimental method that can conclusively confirm, or rule out, the existence
of these quasiparticles: Firstly, we shift focus from superconductors, whose
very topological nature is disputed, to the unambiguous topological superfluid
$^3$He. Secondly, we identify the interaction between surface waves and the
chiral Majorana current in the bulk of a topological superfluid of varying
density. The proposed experiment provides a path towards the detection of the
Majorana fermion, an 80-year-old theoretical prediction. It is realistically
achievable based on the advent of microscopic superfluid resonators coupled to
optical cavities. The proposal may open the door to experiments ranging from
simulations of exotic cosmological particles to topological acoustics and fault
tolerant quantum computing.

<h3>Giant High-order Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Electrical Transports  Induced by Valley Flipping in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</h3>

</p><i>Yuelin Shao, Xi Dai</i>
<p>We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley
polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene
(BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock
energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized
phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized
where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the
atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the
1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley
polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which
will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such
irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong
nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been
already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.

<h3>Symmetry-guided inverse design of self-assembling multiscale DNA origami  tilings</h3>

<p>Recent advances enable the creation of nanoscale building blocks with complex
geometries and interaction specificities for self-assembly. This nearly
boundless design space necessitates design principles for defining the mutual
interactions between multiple particle species to target a user-specified
complex structure or pattern. In this article, we develop a symmetry-based
method to generate the interaction matrices that specify the assembly of
two-dimensional tilings which we illustrate using equilateral triangles. By
exploiting the allowed 2D symmetries, we develop an algorithmic approach by
which any periodic 2D tiling can be generated from an arbitrarily large number
of subunit species, notably addressing an unmet challenge of engineering 2D
crystals with periodicities that can be arbitrarily larger than subunit size.
To demonstrate the utility of our design approach, we encode specific
interactions between triangular subunits synthesized by DNA origami and show
that we can guide their self-assembly into tilings with a wide variety of
symmetries, using up to 12 unique species of triangles. By conjugating specific
triangles with gold nanoparticles, we fabricate gold-nanoparticle supercrystals
whose lattice parameter spans up to 300 nm. Finally, to generate economical
design rules, we compare the design economy of various tilings. In particular,
we show that (1) higher symmetries allow assembly of larger unit cells with
fewer subunits and (2) linear supercrystals can be designed more economically
using linear primitive unit cells. This work provides a simple algorithmic
approach to designing periodic assemblies, which may open new doors to the
multiscale assembly of superlattices of nanostructured "metatoms" with
engineered plasmonic functions.

<h3>Complete Integrability of the Problem of Full Statistics of  Nonstationary Mass Transfer in the Simple Inclusion Process</h3>

</p><i>Eldad Bettelheim, Baruch Meerson</i>
<p>The Simple Inclusion Process (SIP) interpolates between two well-known
lattice gas models: the independent random walkers and the
Kipnis-Marchiro-Presutti model. Here we study large deviations of nonstationary
mass transfer in the SIP at long times in one dimension. We suppose that $N\gg
1$ particles start from a single lattice site, and we are interested in the
full probability density $\mathcal{P}(M,N,T)$ of observing $M$ particles,
$0\leq M\leq N$, at $x>0$ at a specified time $T\gg 1$. At large times, the
probability distribution has a large-deviation behavior, $-\ln
\mathcal{P}(M,N,T) \simeq \sqrt{T} s(M/N,N/\sqrt{T})$. We determine the rate
function $s$ exactly by uncovering and utilizing complete integrability, by the
inverse scattering method, of the underlying equations of the macroscopic
fluctuation theory. We also analyze different asymptotic limits of the rate
function $s$.

<h3>Impact of Resin Molecular Weight on Drying Kinetics and Sag of Coatings</h3>

<p>The work herein investigates the impact of resin molecular weight and solvent
choice on drying kinetics and sag velocity in polymer films. These films,
ranging in thickness from ~60 micrometer to ~120 micrometer were formulated
with 45% by weight polymer resin in one of two solvent packages with different
relative evaporation rates (RER). Gravimetry was initially used to track drying
kinetics and a one-dimensional diffusion model was utilized to compute the
apparent solvent diffusivity. In addition, the film thickness was tracked with
optical profilometry. Results from these measurements showed that for fixed
molecular weight the drying kinetics increased by approximately two-fold for
the high RER solvent, whereas the apparent diffusivity tended to increase with
increasing polymer molecular weight. Films formulated from higher molecular
weight resins had greater initial viscosities and thicknesses for identical
draw down blade clearance. By extension, the higher apparent diffusivities at
greater molecular weights were attributed to effects of prolonged evaporation
times for the thicker films. The sag velocity was measured through the
thickness of the film for these systems at a 5 degree incline using the
Variable Angle Inspection Microscope (VAIM). Measurements showed an increase in
sag velocity for thinner and less viscous films, which was somewhat surprising
both because a thinner film will experience lower gravitational stress and
quicker drying times as compared to a thicker film. From these data we conclude
that formulating a coating with higher molecular weight resin, although likely
to increase drying time, will tend to deter sag because of the large impact of
viscosity on these phenomena.

<h3>Ultrafast exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures</h3>

<p>Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin
transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the
formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies
reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van
der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible
evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a
brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional
semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is
proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals
heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.

<h3>Tuning the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect from large to zero in the two  ferromagnetic states of the layered SmMn2Ge2</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19581" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19581</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mahima Singh, Jyotirmoy Sau, Banik Rai, Arunanshu Panda, Manoranjan Kumar, Nitesh Kumar</i>
<p>The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in a ferromagnetic metal is
completely determined by its band structure. Since the spin orientation
direction is an important band structure tuning parameter, it is highly
desirable to study the anomalous Hall effect in a system with multiple spin
reorientation transitions. We study a layered tetragonal room temperature
ferromagnet SmMn2Ge2, which gives us the opportunity to measure
magneto-transport properties where the long c-axis and the short a-axis can
both be magnetically easy axes depending on the temperature range we choose. We
show a moderately large completely intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC)
up to room temperature when the crystal is magnetized along c-axis.
Interestingly, the AHC can be tuned to completely extrinsic with extremely
large values when the crystal is magnetized along a-axis irrespective of
whether the a-axis is magnetically easy or hard axis. The first principles
calculations show that nodal line states originate from Mn-d orbitals just
below the Fermi energy (EF) in the electronic band structure when the spins are
oriented along the c-axis. Intrinsic AHC originates form the Berry curvature
effect of the gapped nodal lines in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. AHC
almost vanishes when the spins are aligned along the a-axis because nodal line
states shift above EF and become unoccupied states.

<h3>Topological Phases and Phase Transitions with Dipolar Symmetry Breaking</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Amogh Anakru, Zhen Bi</i>
<p>Systems with dipole moment conservation have been of recent interest, as they
realize both novel quantum dynamics and exotic ground state phases. In this
work, we study some generic properties of 1-D and 2-D dipole-conserving
fermionic models at integer fillings. We find that a dipolar symmetry-breaking
phase can result in a mean-field band insulator whose topological indices can
strongly affect the low-energy physics of the dipolar Goldstone modes. We study
the 2-D topological phase transition of the mean-field ground states in the
presence of the Goldstone modes. The critical theory resembles the 2+1d quantum
electrodynamics coupled to massless Dirac fermions with some crucial
differences and shows a novel quantum critical point featuring a nontrivial
dynamical exponent. We also discuss the analogous case of 1-D dipole-conserving
models and the role of topological invariants.

<h3>Orbital-Selective Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer  Lanthanum Nickelates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19617" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19617</a>
<br>
</p><i>Fabian Jakubczyk, Armando Consiglio, Domenico Di Sante, Ronny Thomale, Carsten Timm</i>
<p>The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited
stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its
likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report
either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external
magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting
order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body
analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni
$d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the
consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the
correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the
superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find
a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to
previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through
a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons.
Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as
compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth
composition but also provoke similarities to other pending candidate odd-parity
superconductors.

<h3>Anyonic statistics and slow quasiparticle dynamics in a graphene  fractional quantum Hall interferometer</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</a>
<br>
</p><i>Noah L. Samuelson, Liam A. Cohen, Will Wang, Simon Blanch, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrea F. Young</i>
<p>Anyons are two dimensional particles with fractional exchange statistics that
emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases.
Experimentally, anyonic statistics manifest directly in the edge-state
Fabry-P\'erot interferometer geometry, where the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized
anyons in the interferometer bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp} \theta_a$ to the
observed interference pattern, where $\theta_a$ is twice the statistical
exchange phase. Here, we report a measurement of $\theta_a$ in a monolayer
graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu$ = 1/3. We find a preponderance
of phase slips with magnitudes $\Delta \theta \approx 2 \pi / 3$, confirming
the result of past experiments in GaAs quantum wells and consistent with
expectations for the tunneling of Abelian anyons into the interferometer bulk.
In contrast to prior work, however, single anyon tunneling events manifest as
instantaneous and irreversible phase slips, indicative of quasiparticle
equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes in some cases. We use the discrepancy
between the quasiparticle equilibration rate and our measurement speed to vary
the interferometer area and $N_{qp}$ independently, allowing us to precisely
determine the interferometer phase and monitor the entry and exit of individual
anyons to the interferometer loop in the time domain. Besides providing a
replication of previous interferometric measurements sensitive to $\theta_a$ in
GaAs, our results bring anyon dynamics into the experimental regime and suggest
that the average `topological charge' of a mesoscopic quantum Hall device can
be held constant over hour long timescales.

<h3>Topologically protected flatness in chiral moiré heterostructures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19656</a>
<br>
</p><i>Valentin Crépel, Peize Ding, Nishchhal Verma, Nicolas Regnault, Raquel Queiroz</i>
<p>The observation of delicate correlated phases in twisted heterostructures of
graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides suggests an inherent resilience
of moir\'e flat bands against certain types of disorder. We investigate the
robustness of moir\'e flat bands in the chiral limit of the Bistrizer-MacDonald
model, applicable to both platforms in certain limits. We show a drastic
difference between the protection of the first magic angle and higher magic
angles to chiral symmetric disorder such as random higher moir\'e potential
harmonics arising, for instance, from lattice relaxation. We find that the
first magic angle is topologically protected by a topological index theorem,
similar to the protection of the zeroth Landau level of Dirac fermions, whose
flatness withstands any chiral symmetric perturbation such as non-uniform
magnetic fields. Focusing on the first magic angle of twisted bilayer graphene,
our analysis reveals a hidden non-local constant of motion that permits the
decomposition of the non-abelian gauge field induced by inter-layer tunnelings
into two decoupled abelian ones, underscoring a topological mechanism for band
flatness. Through numerical simulations, we further show the strikingly
different robustness of flat bands across protected (first) and unprotected
(higher) magic angles in the presence of various types of disorder and identify
the scattering processes that are enhanced or suppressed in the chiral limit.
Interestingly, we find that the suppression of disorder broadening persists
away from the chiral limit and is further accentuated by isolating a single
sublattice polarized flat band in energy. Our analysis suggests the Berry
curvature hotspot at the top of the K and K' valence band in the transition
metal dichalcogenide monolayers is essential for the stability of its moir\'e
flat bands and their correlated states.
