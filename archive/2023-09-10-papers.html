<h3>Pair-Interactions of Self-Propelled SiO2-Pt Janus Colloids</h3>

Driven by the necessity to achieve a thorough comprehension of the bottom-up
fabrication process of functional materials, this experimental study
investigates the pair-wise interactions or collisions between chemically active
SiO2-Pt Janus Colloids. These collisions are categorized based on the Janus
colloids' orientations before and after they make physical contact. In addition
to the hydrodynamic interactions, the Janus colloids are also known to affect
each other's chemical field, resulting in chemophoretic interactions, which
depend on the reactive nature of the metal site. These interactions lead to a
noticeable decrease in particle speed and changes in orientation, which depends
on the duration of contact, yielding different collision types. Our findings
reveal distinct configurations of contact during collisions, whose mechanisms
and likelihood is found to be dependent primarily on the chemical interactions.
Such estimates of collision and their characterization in dilute suspensions
shall have key impact in determining the arrangement and time scales of
dynamical structures and assemblies of denser suspensions, and potentially the
functional materials of the future.

A recently introduced recurrence-relation ansatz applied to the
Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model is here applied to the Bose-Hubbard model that
reduced the model to an easily soluble model. The results obtained for the
two-point density correlations resemble somewhat those obtained recently also
but in a much more complicated fashion. Our ansatz may be of value for the
solution of many-body quantum mechanical problems.

For the first time, electroluminescence detected in the middle and far
infrared ranges from silicon carbide nanostructures on silicon, obtained in the
framework of the Hall geometry. Silicon carbide on silicon was grown by the
method of substitution of atoms on silicon. The electroluminescence from the
edge channels of nanostructures is induced due to the longitudinal drain-source
current. The electroluminescence spectra obtained in the terahertz frequency
range, 3.4, 0.12 THz, arise due to the quantum Faraday effect. Within the
framework of the proposed model, the longitudinal current induces a change in
the number of magnetic flux quanta in the edge channels, which leads to the
appearance of a generation current in the edge channel and, accordingly, to
terahertz radiation.

<h3>Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Studies of Quantum Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03935</a>

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) -- with its exceptional
sensitivity to both the binding energy and momentum of valence electrons in
solids -- provides unparalleled insights into the electronic structure of
quantum materials. Over the last two decades, the advent of femtosecond lasers,
which can deliver ultrashort and coherent light pulses, has ushered the ARPES
technique into the time domain. Now, time-resolved ARPES (TR-ARPES) can probe
ultrafast electron dynamics and the out-of-equilibrium electronic structure,
providing a wealth of information otherwise unattainable in conventional ARPES
experiments. This paper begins with an introduction to the theoretical
underpinnings of TR-ARPES followed by a description of recent advances in
state-of-the-art ultrafast sources and optical excitation schemes. It then
reviews paradigmatic phenomena investigated by TR-ARPES thus far, such as
out-of-equilibrium electronic states and their spin dynamics, Floquet-Volkov
states, photoinduced phase transitions, electron-phonon coupling, and surface
photovoltage effects. Each section highlights TR-ARPES data from diverse
classes of quantum materials, including semiconductors, charge-ordered systems,
topological materials, excitonic insulators, van der Waals materials, and
unconventional superconductors. These examples demonstrate how TR-ARPES has
played a critical role in unraveling the complex dynamical properties of
quantum materials. The conclusion outlines possible future directions and
opportunities for this powerful technique.

<h3>Nonlinear Lifshitz Photon Theory in Condensed Matter Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03946" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03946</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Hsien Du, Cenke Xu, Dam Thanh Son</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an interacting theory of a $U(1)$ gauge boson with a quadratic
dispersion relation, which we call the "nonlinear Lifshitz photon theory.'' The
Lifshitz photon is a three-dimensional generalization of the Tkachenko mode in
rotating superfluids. Starting from the Wigner crystal of charged particles
coupled to a dynamical $U(1)$ gauge field, after integrating out gapped degrees
of freedom, we arrive at the Lagrangian for the nonlinear Lifshitz photon. The
symmetries of the theory include a global $U(1)$ 1-form symmetry and
nonlinearly realized "magnetic" translation and rotation symmetries. The
interaction terms in the theory lead to the decay of the Lifshitz photon, the
rate of which we estimate. We show that the Wilson loop, which plays the role
of the order parameter of the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form global
symmetry, deviates from the perimeter law by an additional logarithmic factor.
We explore potential connections to other condensed matter systems, with a
particular focus on quantum spin ice and ferromagnets. Finally, we generalize
our theory to higher dimensions.

<h3>Disorder in the non-linear anomalous Hall effect of  $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric Dirac fermions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The study of the non-linear anomalous Hall effect (NLAHE) in
$\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems has focussed on intrinsic
mechanisms. Here we show that disorder contributes substantially to NLAHE and
often overwhelms intrinsic terms. We identify terms to zeroth order in the
disorder strength involving the Berry curvature dipole, skew scattering and
side-jump, all exhibiting a strong peak as a function of the Fermi energy, a
signature of interband coherence. Our results suggest NLAHE at experimentally
relevant transport densities in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems is
likely to be extrinsic.

<h3>Edge theory of the non-Hermitian skin modes in higher dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03950" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03950</a>
<br>
<i>Kai Zhang, Zhesen Yang, Kai Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
In this Letter, we propose a universal edge theory for the higher-dimensional
non-Hermitian edge-skin modes. In contrast to the well-understood corner-skin
effect, we demonstrate that the edge-skin effect requires the protection of
reciprocity or inversion. Through an exact mapping, we show that these skin
modes share the same bulk-edge correspondence as the Fermi-arc states in a
Hermitian Dirac semimetal. Based on this mapping, we introduce a bulk
projection criterion to identify the skin edge, and utilize the non-Bloch
Hamiltonian under specific cylinder geometry to characterize the localization
features of edge-skin modes. We find that the edge-skin modes are made of
components with real-valued momenta along the edge, and interestingly the decay
direction typically deviates from the normal direction of the edge, a
phenomenon we term skewness. Furthermore, we reveal the remarkable sensitivity
of the cylinder-geometry spectrum to disturbances that violate fragile
reciprocity. When this symmetry is disrupted, the cylinder-geometry spectrum
undergoes an abrupt transition towards the near open-boundary spectrum,
underscoring a key difference between corner-skin and edge-skin effects.

<h3>3D Topological Semimetal Phases of Strained $α$-Sn on Insulating  Substrate</h3>

$\alpha$-Sn is an elemental topological material, whose topological phases
can be tuned by strain and magnetic field. Such tunability offers a substantial
potential for topological electronics. However, InSb substrates, commonly used
to stabilize $\alpha$-Sn allotrope, suffer from parallel conduction,
restricting transport investigations and potential applications. Here, the
successful MBE growth of high-quality $\alpha$-Sn layers on insulating, hybrid
CdTe/GaAs(001) substrates, with bulk electron mobility approaching 20000
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ is reported. The electronic properties of the samples
are systematically investigated by independent complementary techniques,
enabling thorough characterization of the 3D Dirac (DSM) and Weyl (WSM)
semimetal phases induced by the strains and magnetic field, respectively.
Magneto-optical experiments, corroborated with band structure modeling, provide
an exhaustive description of the bulk states in the DSM phase. The modeled
electronic structure is directly observed in angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, which reveals linearly dispersing bands near the Fermi level. The
first detailed study of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance relates this
effect to the chiral anomaly and, consequently, to the presence of WSM.
Observation of the $\pi$ Berry phase in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations agrees
with the topologically non-trivial nature of the investigated samples. Our
findings establish $\alpha$-Sn as an attractive topological material for
exploring relativistic physics and future applications.

<h3>Surface sensitivity of magnetization in the mesoscopic regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03957" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03957</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin Moseni, Sinisa Coh</i>
<br>
<br>
Some of the magnetization of a solid originates from orbital currents flowing
on its surface. When the solid's surface is perturbed, it triggers two changes
in the magnetization. One arises from variations of the electron wavefunction
and energy, while the other emerges from a modification in the kinetic angular
momentum operator. In the macroscopic regime of our model, these two bulk
effects cancel each other, resulting in no impact of the surface perturbation
on the magnetization -- consistent with prior work. We find a departure from
this behavior in the mesoscopic regime, where the cancelation of two terms is
not complete. In this regime, surprisingly, perturbation of the surface of the
solid can change the magnetic dipole of the solid in proportion to the size of
the entire solid.

<h3>How prominent are microemulsion phases in 2D electron systems?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03961</a>
<br>
<i>Sandeep Joy, Brian Skinner</i>
<br>
<br>
In two-dimensional electronic systems, direct first-order phase transitions
are prohibited as a consequence of the long-range Coulomb interaction, which
implies a stiff energetic penalty for macroscopic phase separation. A prominent
proposal is that any direct first-order transition is instead replaced by a
sequence of "microemulsion" phases, in which the two phases are mixed in
patterns of mesoscopic domains. In this note, we comment on the range $\Delta
n$ of average electron density that such microemulsion phases may occupy. We
point out that, even without knowing the value of a phenomenological parameter
associated with surface tension between the two phases, one can place a fairly
strong upper bound on the value of $\Delta n$. We make numerical estimates for
$\Delta n$ in the case of the Fermi liquid to Wigner crystal transition and
find $\Delta n$ to be on the order of $10^7$ cm$^{-2}$. This value is much
smaller than the width of the phase transition observed in experiments,
suggesting that disorder is a more likely explanation for the apparent
broadening of the transition.

<h3>First-principle Study of Multiple Metastable Charge Ordering States in  La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03995</a>

<i>Nam Nguyen, Alex Taekyung Lee, Vijay Singh, Anh T. Ngo, Hyowon Park</i>
<br>
<br>
La doped SrFeO$_{3}$, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$, exhibits a
metal-to-insulator transition accompanied by both antiferromagnetic and charge
ordering states along with the Fe-O bond disproportionation below a critical
temperature near 200K. Unconventionally slow charge dynamics measured in this
material near the critical temperature shows that its excited charge ordering
states can exhibit novel electronic structures with nontrivial energy profiles.
Here, we reveal possible metastable states of charge ordering structures in
La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ using the first-principle and climbing image
nudged elastic band methods. In the strong correlation regime,
La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a charge
ordering state of the big-small-big pattern, consistent with the experimental
measurement of this material at the low temperature. As the correlation effect
becomes weak, we find at least two possible metastable charge ordering states
with the distinct Fe-O bond disproportionation. Remarkably, a ferroelectric
metallic state emerges with the small energy barrier of $\sim$7 meV, driven by
a metastable CO state of the small-medium-big pattern. The electronic
structures of these metastable charge ordering states are noticeably different
from those of the ground-state. Our results can provide an insightful
explanation to multiple metastable charge ordering states and the slow charge
dynamics of this and related oxide materials.

<h3>More on symmetry resolved operator entanglement</h3>

The `operator entanglement' of a quantum operator $O$ is a useful indicator
of its complexity, and, in one-dimension, of its approximability by matrix
product operators. Here we focus on spin chains with a global $U(1)$
conservation law, and on operators $O$ with a well-defined $U(1)$ charge, for
which it is possible to resolve the operator entanglement of $O$ according to
the $U(1)$ symmetry. We employ the notion of symmetry resolved operator
entanglement (SROE) introduced in [PRX Quantum 4, 010318 (2023)] and extend the
results of the latter paper in several directions. Using a combination of
conformal field theory and of exact analytical and numerical calculations in
critical free fermionic chains, we study the SROE of the thermal density matrix
$\rho_\beta = e^{- \beta H}$ and of charged local operators evolving in
Heisenberg picture $O = e^{i t H} O e^{-i t H}$. Our main results are: i) the
SROE of $\rho_\beta$ obeys the operator area law; ii) for free fermions, local
operators in Heisenberg picture can have a SROE that grows logarithmically in
time or saturates to a constant value; iii) there is equipartition of the
entanglement among all the charge sectors except for a pair of fermionic
creation and annihilation operators.

<h3>Ab initio calculations of low-energy quasiparticle lifetimes in bilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04048" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04048</a>
<br>
<i>Catalin D. Spataru, François Léonard</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experimental results we calculate from first-principles
the lifetime of low-energy quasiparticles in bilayer graphene (BLG). We take
into account the scattering rate arising from electron-electron interactions
within the $GW$ approximation for the electron self-energy and consider several
p-type doping levels ranging from $0$ to $\rho \approx 2.4\times 10^{12}$
holes/cm$^2$. In the undoped case we find that the average inverse lifetime
scales linearly with energy away from the charge neutrality point, with values
in good agreement with experiments. The decay rate is approximately three times
larger than in monolayer graphene, a consequence of the enhanced screening in
BLG. In the doped case, the dependence of the inverse lifetime on quasiparticle
energy acquires a non-linear component due to the opening of an additional
decay channel mediated by acoustic plasmons.

<h3>Microwave spectroscopy of Majorana vortex modes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04050" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04050</a>

<i>Zhibo Ren, Justin Copenhaver, Leonid Rokhinson, Jukka I. Väyrynen</i>
<br>
<br>
The observation of zero-bias conductance peaks in vortex cores of certain
Fe-based superconductors has sparked renewed interest in vortex-bound Majorana
states. These materials are believed to be intrinsically topological in their
bulk phase, thus avoiding potentially problematic interface physics encountered
in superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures. However, progress toward a
vortex-based topological qubit is hindered by our inability to measure the
topological quantum state of a non-local vortex Majorana state, i.e., the
charge of a vortex pair. In this paper, we theoretically propose a
microwave-based charge parity readout of the Majorana vortex pair charge. A
microwave resonator above the vortices can couple to the charge allowing for a
dispersive readout of the Majorana parity. Our technique may also be used in
vortices in conventional superconductors and allows one to probe the lifetime
of vortex-bound quasiparticles, which is currently beyond existing scanning
tunneling microscopy capabilities.

<h3>Observation of Hybrid-Order Topological Pump in a Kekule-Textured  Graphene Lattice</h3>

Thouless charge pumping protocol provides an effective route for realizing
topological particle transport. To date, the first-order and higher-order
topological pumps, exhibiting transitions of edge-bulk-edge and
corner-bulk-corner states, respectively, are observed in a variety of
experimental platforms. Here, we propose a concept of hybrid-order topological
pump, which involves a transition of bulk, edge, and corner states
simultaneously. More specifically, we consider a Kekul\'e-textured graphene
lattice that features a tunable phase parameter. The finite sample of zigzag
boundaries, where the corner configuration is abnormal and inaccessible by
repeating unit cells, hosts topological responses at both the edges and
corners. The former is protected by a nonzero winding number, while the latter
can be explained by a nontrivial vector Chern number. Using our skillful
acoustic experiments, we verify those nontrivial boundary landmarks and
visualize the consequent hybrid-order topological pump process directly. This
work deepens our understanding to higher-order topological phases and broadens
the scope of topological pumps.

Hypersonic vehicles must withstand extreme conditions during flights that
exceed five times the speed of sound. This class of vehicles has the potential
to facilitate rapid access to space, bolster defense capabilities, and create a
new paradigm for transcontinental earth-to-earth travel. However, the extreme
aerothermal environments resulting from high Mach number trajectories create
significant challenges for vehicle materials and structures. As hypersonic
systems advance, there is a critical need to develop novel materials that are
resilient to a combination of thermal and mechanical loads, aggressive
oxidizing environments, and rapid heating rates. This work aims to provide a
succinct discussion of emerging design strategies for refractory alloys,
composites, and ceramics used for hypersonic vehicles. We will highlight key
design principles for critical vehicle areas such as primary structures,
thermal protection, and propulsion systems; the role of theory and computation
in elucidating structure-property-processing relationships; and strategies for
advancing laboratory scale materials to flight-ready components such as
aerostructures and thermal protection systems.

<br>

Negative Poisson's ratio as the anomalous characteristic generally exists in
artificial architectures, such as re-entrant and honeycomb structures. The
structures with negative Poisson's ratio have attracted intensive attention due
to their unique auxetic effect and many promising applications in shear
resistant and energy absorption fields. However, experimental observation of
negative Poisson's ratio in natural materials barely happened, although various
two-dimensional layered materials are predicted in theory. Herein, we report
the anisotropic Raman response and the intrinsic intralayer negative Poisson's
ratio of two-dimensional natural black arsenic (b-As) via strain engineering
strategy. The results were evident by the detailed Raman spectrum of b-As under
uniaxial strain together with density functional theory calculations. It is
found that b-As was softer along the armchair than zigzag direction. The
anisotropic mechanical features and van der Waals interactions play essential
roles in strain-dependent Raman shifts and negative Poisson's ratio in the
natural b-As along zigzag direction. This work may shed a light on the
mechanical properties and potential applications of two-dimensional puckered
materials.

Charge transport in solids at low temperature reveals a material's mesoscopic
properties and structure. Under a magnetic field, Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)
oscillations inform complex quantum transport phenomena that are not limited by
the ground state characteristics. Here, in elemental metal Cr with two
incommensurately superposed lattices of ions and a spin-density-wave ground
state, we reveal that the phases of several low-frequency SdH oscillations in
sigma_xx (rho_xx) and sigma_yy (rho_yy) are opposite, contrast with
oscillations from normal cyclotron orbits that maintain identical phases. We
trace the origin of the low frequency SdH oscillations to quantum interference
effects arising from the incommensurate orbits of Cr's superposed reciprocal
lattices, and explain the observed pi-phase shift by the reconnection of
anisotropic joint open and closed orbits.

<h3>Chiral magneto-phonons with tunable topology in anisotropic quantum  magnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a mechanism to obtain chiral phonon-like excitations from the
bond-dependent magnetoelastic couplings in the absence of out-of-plane
magnetization and magnetic fields. We provide a systematic way to understand
the hybrid excitation by its phononic analog, and thus we dub it
magneto-phonon. We recognize that the system is equivalent to the class D of
topological phonons, and show the tunable chirality and topology by an in-plane
magnetic field in the example of a triangular lattice ferromagnet. As a
possible experimental probe, we evaluate the thermal Hall conductivity. Our
study gives a new perspective on tunable topological and chiral excitations
without Dzaloshinskii-Moriya and Raman spin interactions, which suggests
possible applications of spintronics and phononics in various anisotropic
magnets and/or Kitaev materials.

<h3>Thermodynamic Origins of Structural Metastability in Two-Dimensional  Black Arsenic</h3>

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have aroused considerable research interests
owing to their potential applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.
Thermodynamic stability of 2D structures inevitably affects the performance and
power consumption of the fabricated nanodevices. Black arsenic (b-As), as a
cousin of black phosphorus, has presented the extremely high anisotropy in
physical properties. However, the systematic research on structural stability
of b-As is still lack. Herein, we demonstrated the detailed analysis on
structural metastability of the natural b-As, and determined its existence
conditions in terms of two essential thermodynamic variables as hydrostatic
pressure and temperature. Our results confirmed that b-As can only survive
below 0.7 GPa, and then irreversibly transform to gray arsenic, in consistent
with our theoretical calculations. Furthermore, thermal annealing strategy was
developed to precisely control the thickness of b-As flake, and it sublimates
at 300 oC. These results could pave the way for 2D b-As in many promising
applications.

<h3>Prediction of the Cu Oxidation State from EELS and XAS Spectra Using  Supervised Machine Learning</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) provide detailed information about bonding, distributions and locations
of atoms, and their coordination numbers and oxidation states. However,
analysis of XAS/EELS data often relies on matching an unknown experimental
sample to a series of simulated or experimental standard samples. This limits
analysis throughput and the ability to extract quantitative information from a
sample. In this work, we have trained a random forest model capable of
predicting the oxidation state of copper based on its L-edge spectrum. Our
model attains an $R^2$ score of 0.89 and a root mean square valence error of
0.21 on simulated data. It has also successfully predicted experimental L-edge
EELS spectra taken in this work and XAS spectra extracted from the literature.
We further demonstrate the utility of this model by predicting simulated and
experimental spectra of mixed valence samples generated by this work. This
model can be integrated into a real time EELS/XAS analysis pipeline on mixtures
of copper containing materials of unknown composition and oxidation state. By
expanding the training data, this methodology can be extended to data-driven
spectral analysis of a broad range of materials.

<h3>Boltzmann sampling with quantum annealers via fast Stein correction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04120</a>
<br>
<i>Ryosuke Shibukawa, Ryo Tamura, Koji Tsuda</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite the attempts to apply a quantum annealer to Boltzmann sampling, it is
still impossible to perform accurate sampling at arbitrary temperatures.
Conventional distribution correction methods such as importance sampling and
resampling cannot be applied, because the analytical expression of sampling
distribution is unknown for a quantum annealer. Stein correction (Liu and Lee,
2017) can correct the samples by weighting without the knowledge of the
sampling distribution, but the naive implementation requires the solution of a
large-scale quadratic program, hampering usage in practical problems. In this
letter, a fast and approximate method based on random feature map and
exponentiated gradient updates is developed to compute the sample weights, and
used to correct the samples generated by D-Wave quantum annealers. In
benchmarking problems, it is observed that the residual error of thermal
average calculations is reduced significantly. If combined with our method,
quantum annealers may emerge as a viable alternative to long-established Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods.

A high-spin nucleus coupled to a color center can act as a long-lived memory
qudit in a spin-photon interface. The germanium vacancy (GeV) in diamond has
attracted recent attention due to its excellent spectral properties and
provides access to the 10-dimensional Hilbert space of the $I = 9/2$
${}^{73}$Ge nucleus. Here, we observe the ${}^{73}$GeV hyperfine structure,
perform nuclear spin readout, and optically initialize the ${}^{73}$Ge spin
into any eigenstate on a $\mu$s-timescale and with a fidelity of up to $97 \pm
3\%$. Our results establish ${}^{73}$GeV as an optically addressable high-spin
quantum platform for a high-efficiency spin-photon interface as well as for
foundational quantum physics and metrology.

The magnetism is an old problem of Physics. Most interesting part of the
research on magnetism is its thermodynamic behaviour. In this review, the
thermodynamic phase transitions, mainly in ferromagnetic model systems, are
discussed. The model system has a characteristic of continuous symmetry. In
this context, the classical XY and Heisenberg model are chosen for discussion.
With a historical survey of such phase transition observed in such models, the
results of the recent (over two decades) studies are collected and reviewed.
The equilibrium phase transition in such systems are discussed to highlight the
dependence of the critical temperatures on the anisotropy, dilution etc. On the
other hand, the nonequilibrium results of such systems driven by time dependent
magnetic field, are also reviewed. We believe, this review is a modern
documentation and collection of works in the field of theoretical magnetism
which may be extremely useful for the researcher working in this field.

<h3>How close are the classical two-body potentials to ab initio  calculations? Insights from linear machine learning based force matching</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04140" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04140</a>
<br>
<i>Zheng Yu, Ajay Annamareddy, Dane Morgan, Bu Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we propose a linear machine learning force matching approach
that can directly extract pair atomic interactions from ab initio calculations
in amorphous structures. The local feature representation is specifically
chosen to make the linear weights a force field as a force/potential function
of the atom pair distance. Consequently, this set of functions is the closest
representation of the ab initio forces given the two-body approximation and
finite scanning in the configurational space. We validate this approach in
amorphous silica. Potentials in the new force field (consisting of tabulated
Si-Si, Si-O, and O-O potentials) are significantly softer than existing
potentials that are commonly used for silica, even though all of them produce
the tetrahedral network structure and roughly similar glass properties. This
suggests that those commonly used classical force fields do not offer
fundamentally accurate representations of the atomic interaction in silica. The
new force field furthermore produces a lower glass transition temperature
($T_g\sim$1800 K) and a positive liquid thermal expansion coefficient,
suggesting the extraordinarily high $T_g$ and negative liquid thermal expansion
of simulated silica could be artifacts of previously developed classical
potentials. Overall, the proposed approach provides a fundamental yet intuitive
way to evaluate two-body potentials against ab initio calculations, thereby
offering an efficient way to guide the development of classical force fields.

<h3>Driven Majorana Modes: A Route to Synthetic $p_x+ip_y$ Superconductivity</h3>

<i>Lingyu Yang, Gia-Wei Chern, Shi-Zeng Lin</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a protocol to realize synthetic $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors in
one-dimensional topological systems that host Majorana fermions. By
periodically driving a localized Majorana mode across the system, our protocol
realizes a topological pumping of Majorana fermions, analogous to the adiabatic
Thouless pumping of electrical charges. Importantly, similar to the realization
of a Chern insulator through Thouless pumping, we show that pumping of Majorana
zero modes could lead to a $p_x + ip_y$ superconductor in the two dimensions of
space and synthetic time. The Floquet theory is employed to map the driven
one-dimensional system to a two-dimensional synthetic system by considering
frequency as a new dimension. We demonstrate such Floquet $p_x + i p_y$
superconductors using the Kitaev $p$-wave superconductor chain, a prototypical
1D topological system, as well as its more realistic realization in the 1D
Kondo lattice model as examples. We further show the appearance of a new $\pi$
Majorana mode at the Floquet zone boundary in an intermediate drive frequency
region. Our work suggests a driven magnetic spiral coupled to a superconductor
as a promising platform for the realization of novel topological
superconductors.

We study two dimensional electron systems confined in wide quantum wells
whose subband separation is comparable with the Zeeman energy. Two N = 0 Landau
levels from different subbands and with opposite spins are pinned in energy
when they cross each other and electrons can freely transfer between them. When
the disorder is strong, we observe clear hysteresis in our data corresponding
to instability of the electron distribution in the two crossing levels. When
the intra-layer interaction dominates, multiple minima appear when a Landau
level is 1/3 or 2/3 filled and fractional quantum hall effect can be
stabilized.

Designing materials with enhanced spin charge conversion, i.e., with high
spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and low longitudinal electric conductivity (hence
large spin Hall angle (SHA)), is a challenging task, especially in the presence
of a vast chemical space for compositionally complex alloys (CCAs). In this
work, focusing on the Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti system, we confirm that CCAs exhibit
significant spin Hall conductivities and propose a multi-objective Bayesian
optimization approach (MOBO) incorporated with active learning (AL) in order to
screen for the optimal compositions with significant SHC and SHA. As a result,
within less than 5 iterations we are able to target the TaZr-dominated systems
displaying both high magnitudes of SHC (~-2.0 (10$^{-3}$ $\Omega$ cm)$^{-1}$)
and SHA (~0.03). The SHC is mainly ascribed to the extrinsic skew scattering
mechanism. Our work provides an efficient route for identifying new materials
with significant SHE, which can be straightforwardly generalized to optimize
other properties in a vast chemical space.

<h3>Two-dimensional Discommensurations: an extension to McMillan's  Ginzburg-Landau Theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
Charge density waves (CDW) profoundly affect the electronic properties of
materials and have an intricate interplay with other collective states, like
superconductivity and magnetism. The well-known macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau
theory stands out as a theoretical method for describing CDW phenomenology
without requiring a microscopic description. In particular, it has been
instrumental in understanding the emergence of domain structures in several CDW
compounds, as well as the influence of critical fluctuations and the evolution
towards or across lock-in transitions. In this context, McMillan's foundational
work introduced discommensurations as the objects mediating the transition from
commensurate to incommensurate CDW, through an intermediate nearly commensurate
phase characterised by an ordered array of phase slips. Here, we extend the
simplified, effectively one-dimensional, setting of the original model to a
fully two-dimensional analysis. We find exact and numerical solutions for
several types of discommensuration patterns and provide a framework for
consistently describing multi-component CDW embedded in quasi-two-dimensional
atomic lattices.

<br>
<i>Suman Mondal, Adhip Agarwala, Tapan Mishra, Abhishodh Prakash</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a one-dimensional ladder of two coupled XXZ spin chains and identify
several distinct gapless symmetry-enriched critical phases. These have the same
unbroken symmetries and long-wavelength description, but cannot be connected
without encountering either a phase transition or other intermediate phases.
Using bosonizaion, we analyze the nature of their distinction by determining
how microscopic symmetries are manifested in the long-wavelength fields, the
behavior of charged local and nonlocal operators, and identify the universality
class of all direct continuous phase transitions between them. One of these
phases is a gapless topological phase with protected edge modes. We
characterize its precise nature and place it within the broader classification.
We also find the occurrence of `multiversality' in the phase diagram, wherein
two fixed phases are separated by continuous transitions with different
universality classes in different parameter regimes. We determine the phase
diagram and all its aspects, as well as verify our predictions numerically
using density matrix renormalization group and a mapping onto an effective
spin-1 model.

This article reveals a specific category of solutions for the $1+1$ Variable

formulated using VO $q$-Gaussian functions, granting them significant
versatility in their application to various real-world systems, such as
financial economy areas spanning from conventional stock markets to
cryptocurrencies. The VO $q$-Gaussian functions provide a more robust
expression for the distribution function of price returns in real-world

long-range memory in time series data and autocorrelation patterns.

<br>

We demonstrate that two-dimensional crystals made of active particles can
experience extremely large spontaneous deformations without melting. Using
particles mostly interacting via pairwise repulsive forces, we show that such
active crystals maintain long-range bond order and algebraically-decaying
positional order, but with an exponent $\eta$ not limited by the $\tfrac{1}{3}$
bound given by the (equilibrium) KTHNY theory. We rationalize our findings
using linear elastic theory and show the existence of two well-defined
effective temperatures quantifying respectively large-scale deformations and
bond-order fluctuations. The root of these phenomena lies in the sole
time-persistence of the intrinsic axes of particles, and they should thus be
observed in many different situations.

<h3>Quantum engineering for compactly localized states in disordered Lieb  lattices</h3>

Blending ordering within an uncorrelated disorder potential in families of 3D
Lieb lattices preserves the macroscopic degeneracy of compact localized states
and yields unconventional combinations of localized and delocalized phases --
as shown in Phys.Rev.B 106, 214204 (2022). We proceed to reintroduce
translation invariance in the system by further ordering the disorder, and
discuss the spectral structure and eigenstates features of the resulting
perturbed lattices. We restore order in steps by first (i) rendering the
disorder binary -- i.e. yielding a randomized checkerboard potential, then (ii)
reordering the randomized checkerboard into an ordered one, and at last (iii)
realigning all the checkerboard values yielding a constant potential shift, but
only on a sub-lattice. Along this path, we test the influence of additional
random impurities on the order restoration. We find that in each of these
steps, sub-families of states are projected upon the location of the degenerate
compact states, while the complementary ones are localized in the perturbed
sites with energy determined by the strength of checkerboard. This strategy,
herewith implemented in the 3D Lieb, highlights order restoration as
experimental pathway to engineer spectral and states features in disordered
lattice structures in the pursuit of quantum storage and memory applications.

<h3>Interband scattering- and nematicity-induced quantum oscillation  frequency in FeSe</h3>

<br>
<br>
Understanding the nematic phase observed in the iron-chalcogenide materials
is crucial for describing their superconducting pairing. Experiments on
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ showed that one of the slow Shubnikov--de Haas quantum
oscillation frequencies disappears when tuning the material out of the nematic
phase via chemical substitution or pressure, which has been interpreted as a
Lifshitz transition [Coldea et al., npj Quant Mater 4, 2 (2019), Reiss et al.,
Nat. Phys. 16, 89-94 (2020)]. Here, we present a generic, alternative scenario
for a nematicity-induced sharp quantum oscillation frequency which disappears
in the tetragonal phase and is not connected to an underlying Fermi surface
pocket. We show that different microscopic interband scattering mechanisms -
for example, orbital-selective scattering - in conjunction with nematic order
can give rise to this quantum oscillation frequency beyond the standard Onsager
relation. We discuss implications for iron-chalcogenides and the interpretation
of quantum oscillations in other correlated materials.

<br>

We explore magnetic-field-driven chaos in magnetic skyrmions. Oscillating
magnetic fields induce nonlinear dynamics in skyrmions, arising from the
coupling of the secondary gyrotropic mode with a non-uniform, breathing-like
mode. Through micromagnetic simulations, we observe complex patterns of
hypotrochoidal motion in the orbital trajectories of the skyrmions, which are
interpreted using bifurcation diagrams and local Lyapunov exponents. Our
findings demonstrate that different nonlinear behaviors of skyrmions emerge at
distinct temporal stages, depending on the nonlinear dynamic parameters.
Investigating the abundant dynamic patterns of skyrmions during the emergence
of chaos not only enhances device reliability but also provides useful
guidelines for establishing chaos computing based on skyrmion dynamics.

<h3>Random singlets and permutation symmetry in the disordered spin-2  Heisenberg chain: A tensor network renormalization group study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04249" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04249</a>
<br>
<i>Yen-Tung Lin, Shao-Fu Liu, Pochung Chen, Yu-Cheng Lin</i>
<br>
<br>
We use a tensor network renormalization group method to study random $S=2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with alternating bond strength
distributions. In the absence of randomness, bond alternation induces two
quantum critical points between the $S=2$ Haldane phase, a partially dimerized
phase and a fully dimerized phase, depending on the strength of dimerization.
These three phases, called ($\sigma$,$4-\sigma$)=(2,2), (3,1) and (4,0) phases,
are valence-bond solid (VBS) states characterized by $\sigma$ valence bonds
forming across even links and $4-\sigma$ valence bonds on odd links. Here we
study the effects of bond randomness on the ground states of the dimerized spin
chain, calculating disorder-averaged twist order parameters and spin
correlations. We classify the types of random VBS phases depending on strength
of bond randomness $R$ and the dimerization $D$ using the twist order
parameter, which has a negative/positive sign for a VBS phase with odd/even
$\sigma$. Our results demonstrate the existence of a multicritical point in the
intermediate disorder regime with finite dimerization, where (2,2), (3,1) and
(4,0) phases meet. This multicritical point is at the junction of three phase
boundaries in the $R$-$D$ plane: the (2,2)-(3,1) and (3,1)-(4,0) boundaries
that extend to zero randomness, and the (2,2)-(4,0) phase boundary that
connects another multicritical point in the undimerized limit. The undimerized
multicritical point separates a gapless Haldane phase and an
infinite-randomness critical line with the diverging dynamic critical exponent
in the large $R$ limit at $D=0$. Furthermore, we identify the (3,1)-(4,0) phase
boundary as an infinite-randomness critical line even at small $R$, and find
the signature of infinite randomness at the (2,2)-(3,1) phase boundary only in
the vicinity of the multicritical point.

<h3>The Effects of Ligand Substituents on the Character of Zn-Coordination  in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks</h3>

<br>
<br>
Due to their favorable properties and high porosity, zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks (ZIFs) have recently received much limelight for key technologies
such as energy storage, optoelectronics, sensorics, and catalysis. Despite the
widespread interest in these materials, fundamental questions regarding the
zinc coordination environment remain poorly understood. By focusing on
zinc(II)2-methylimidazolate (ZIF-8) and its tetrahedrally coordinated analogs
with Br-, Cl-, and H-substitution in the 2-ring position, we aim to clarify how
variations in the local environment of Zn impact the charge distribution and
the electronic properties of these materials. Our results from
density-functional theory confirm the presence of a Zn coordinative bond with a
large polarization that is quantitatively affected by different substituents on
the organic ligand. Moreover, our findings suggest that the variations induced
by the functionalization in the Zn coordination have a negligible effect on the
electronic structure of the considered compounds. On the other hand, halogen
terminations of the ligands lead to distinct electronic contributions in the
vicinity of the frontier region which ultimately reduce the band-gap size by a
few hundred meV. Experimental results obtained from X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (Zn $K$-edge) confirm the trends predicted by theory and, together
with them, contribute to a better understanding of the structure-property
relationships that are needed to tailor ZIFs for target applications.

<h3>Theoretical issues in the accurate computation of the electron-phonon  interaction contribution to the total energy</h3>

<br>
<br>
The total energy is the most fundamental quantity in ab initio studies. To
include electron-phonon interaction (EPI) contribution to the total energy, we
have recast Allen's equation, for the case of semiconductors and insulators.
This equivalent expression can be computed using available software, leading to
more accurate total energy. We calculate the total energies and their
differences for carbon-diamond and carbon-hexagonal polytypes. For ab initio
investigations on crystalline materials, the accepted norm is to compute
important quantities only for the primitive unit cell because per-atom
quantities are independent of unit cell size. Our results, unexpectedly, show
that the per-atom total energy (EPI included) depends on the unit cell size and
violates the unit cell independence. For example, it differs for carbon-diamond
by 1 eV/atom between the primitive cell and supercells. We observe that
reliable energy differences between polytypes are obtained when, instead of
primitive cells, supercells with identical number of atoms are used. A crucial
inference of general validity is that any equation which contains a partial
Fan-Migdal self-energy term violates the unit cell independence. Further
theoretical studies are needed to establish if the total energy (EPI included)
is an exception or can be reconciled with the unit cell independence.

Asymmetric Ising model, in which coupled spins affect each other differently,
plays an important role in diverse fields, from physics to biology to
artificial intelligence. We show that coupled parametric oscillators provide a
well-controlled and fully characterizable physical system to implement the
model. Such oscillators are bistable. The coupling changes the rate of
interstate switching of an oscillator depending on the state of other
oscillators. Our experiment on two coupled micromechanical resonators reveals
unusual features of asymmetric Ising systems, including the onset of a
probability current that circulates in the stationary state. We relate the
asymmetry to the exponentially strong effect of a periodic force on the
switching rates of an individual parametric oscillator, which we measure. Our
findings open the possibilities of constructing and exploring asymmetric Ising
systems with controlled parameters and connectivity.

<h3>Templates for magnetic symmetry and altermagnetism in hexagonal MnTe</h3>

<br>
<br>
The symmetry of long-range magnetic order in manganese telluride (alpha-MnTe)
is unknown. Likewise, its standing as an altermagnet. To improve the situation,
we present symmetry informed Bragg diffraction patterns based on a primary
magnetic order parameter for antiferromagnetic alignment between Mn dipoles. It
does not break translation symmetry in a centrosymmetric structure, in keeping
with an accepted definition of altermagnetism. Our templates serve x-ray
diffraction that benefits from signal enhancement using a Mn atomic resonance,
and neutron scattering. Even rank multipoles in magnetic neutron diffraction
reflect a core requirement of altermagnetism, because they are zero for strong
spin-orbit coupling. Symmetry in the templates demands that nuclear and
magnetic contributions possess the same phase, which enables standard neutron
polarization analysis on Bragg spots with overlapping contributions. However,
three of the four templates generate Bragg spots that do not appear in the
lattice (nuclear) diffraction pattern, i.e., Bragg spots that are
basis-forbidden and purely magnetic in origin. On the other hand, identical
symmetry demands a 90 deg phase shift between magnetic (time-odd) and
charge-like (time-even, Templeton-Templeton) contributions to x-ray scattering
amplitudes. Consequently, circular polarization in the primary beam of x-rays
is rotated. The difference in the intensities of a Bragg spot measured with
right- and left-handed circular primary polarization defines a chiral
signature. Further tests include predictions in three out four templates of
zero intensity in a specified channel of x-ray polarization. Diffraction
properties of a template are radically different from those of a parity-time
(PT)-symmetric antiferromagnet, for its symmetry allows a linear ME effect and
prohibits both a PM effect and a chiral signature.

Magnon interference is a signature of coherent magnon interactions for
coherent information processing. In this work, we demonstrate programmable
real-time magnon interference, with examples of nearly perfect constructive and
destructive interference, between two remotely coupled yttrium iron garnet
spheres mediated by a coplanar superconducting resonator. Exciting one of the
coupled resonators by injecting single- and double-microwave pulse leads to the
coherent energy exchange between the remote magnonic resonators and allows us
to realize a programmable magnon interference that can define an arbitrary
state of coupled magnon oscillation. The demonstration of time-domain coherent
control of remotely coupled magnon dynamics offers new avenues for advancing
coherent information processing with circuit-integrated hybrid magnonic
networks.

<br>
<br>
The static and dynamic properties of dendrimers in semidilute solutions of
linear chains of comparable size are investigated using Brownian dynamics
simulations. The radius of gyration and diffusivity of a wide variety of low
generation dendrimers and linear chains in solution follow universal scaling
laws independent of their topology. Analysis of the shape functions and
internal density of dendrimers shows that they are more spherical than linear
chains and have a dense core. At intermediate times, dendrimers become
subdiffusive, with an exponent higher than that previously reported for
nanoparticles in semidilute polymer solutions. The long-time diffusivity of
dendrimers does not follow theoretical predictions for nanoparticles. We
propose a new scaling law for the long-time diffusion coefficient of dendrimers
which accounts for the fact that, unlike nanoparticles, dendrimers shrink with
an increase in background solution concentration. Analysis of the properties of
a special case of a higher functionality dendrimer shows a transition from
polymer-like to nanoparticle-like behaviour.

A two-component quantum droplet is an attractive mixture of ultracold bosons
stabilised against collapse by quantum fluctuations. Commonly, two-component
quantum droplets are studied within a balanced mixture. However, the mixture
can be imbalanced resulting in a lower energy but less stably bound droplet, or
even a droplet submerged in a gas. This work focuses on the experimentally
relevant question: how are imbalanced droplets modified by harmonic trap
potentials? Droplet ground states and breathing modes are analysed across the
two-dimensional parameter space of imbalance and trap strength. The robustness
of the droplet imbalance is also studied by releasing the droplet from the
trap, demonstrating that this can lead to the creation of free-space,
imbalanced droplets.

Nontrivial band topology along with magnetism leads to different novel
quantum phases. When time-reversal-symmetry is broken in three-dimensional
topological insulators (TIs) by applying high enough magnetic field or
proximity effect, different phases such as quantum Hall or quantum anomalous
Hall(QAH) emerge and display interesting transport properties for spintronic
applications. The QAH phase displays sidewall chiral edge states which leads to
the QAH effect. In a finite slab, contribution of the surface states depends on
both the cross-section and thickness of the system. Having a small
cross-section and a thin thickness leads to direct coupling of the surfaces, on
the other hand, a thicker slab results in a higher contribution of the
non-trivial sidewall states which connect top and bottom surfaces. In this
regard, we have considered a heterostructure consisting of a TI, namely Bi2Se3,
which is sandwiched between two-dimensional magnetic monolayers of CrI3 to
study its topological and transport properties. Combining DFT and tight-binding
calculations along with non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we show
that a well-defined exchange gap appears in the band structure in which spin
polarised edge states flow. We also study the width and finite-size effect on
the transmission and topological properties of this magnetised TI nanoribbon.

The slave-particle representation is a promising method to treat the
properties of exotic strongly correlated systems. We develop a unified approach
to describe both the paramagnetic state with possible spin-liquid features and
states with strong long-range or short-range magnetic order. Combining the
Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation and fractionalized spin-liquid deconfinement
picture, the Mott transition and Hubbard subbands are considered. The spectrum
in the insulating state is significantly affected by the presence of the spinon
spin-liquid spectrum and a hidden Fermi surface. Presenting a modification of
the Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation in the spin-wave region, we treat the
case of magnetic order, with special attention being paid to the half-metallic
ferromagnetic state. The formation of small and large Fermi surfaces for doped
current carriers in the antiferromagnetic state is also discussed.

By simultaneous Co and Ca-doping we were able to obtain an
$\ce{EuFe2As2}$-based compound with superconductivity appearing above the
antiferromagnetic order of $\ce{Eu^{2+}}$ magnetic moments. However, as soon as
the antiferromagnetic order appears a re-entrance behavior is observed
\textemdash{} instead of zero resistivity and diamagnetic signal down to the

<br>
<br>
The phase diagram of an interacting two-dimensional electron system in a high
magnetic field is enriched by the varying form of the effective Coulomb
interaction, which depends strongly on the Landau level index. While the
fractional quantum Hall states that dominate in the lower energy Landau levels
have been explored experimentally in a variety of two-dimensional systems, much
less work has been done to explore electron solids owing to their subtle
transport signatures and extreme sensitivity to disorder. Here we use chemical
potential measurements to map the phase diagram of electron solid states in
$N=2$, $N=3$, and $N=4$ Landau levels in monolayer graphene. Direct comparison
between our data and theoretical calculations reveals a cascade of
density-tuned phase transitions between electron bubble phases up to two, three
or four electrons per bubble in the N=2, 3 and 4 Landau levels respectively.
Finite temperature measurements are consistent with melting of the solids for
T$\approx$1K.

<br>
<br>
We present results from molecular dynamics simulations exploring the
supercooled dynamics of the Gaussian Core Model in the low- and
intermediate-density regimes. In particular, we discuss the transition from the
low-density hard-sphere-like glassy dynamics to the high-density one. The
dynamics at low densities is well described by the caging mechanism, giving
rise to intermittent dynamics. At high densities, the particles undergo a more
continuous motion in which the concept of cage loses its meaning. We elaborate
on the idea that these different supercooled dynamics are in fact the
precursors of two different glass states.

<br>
<br>
The surface chemistry and inter-connectivity within perovskite nanocrystals
play a critical role in determining the electronic interactions. They manifest
in the Coulomb screening of electron-hole correlations and the carrier
relaxation dynamics, among other many-body processes. Here, we characterize the
coupling between the exciton and free carrier states close to the band-edge in
a ligand-free formamidinium lead bromide nanocrystal assembly via
two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. The optical signatures observed in this
work show: (i) a nonlinear spectral lineshape reminiscent of Fano-like
interference that evidences the coupling between discrete electronic states and
a continuum, (ii) symmetric excited state absorption cross-peaks that suggest
the existence of a coupled exciton-carrier excited state, and (iii) ultrafast
carrier thermalization and exciton formation. Our results highlight the
presence of coherent coupling between exciton and free carriers, particularly
in the sub-100 femtosecond timescales.

<h3>Understanding the role of Hubbard corrections in the rhombohedral phase  of BaTiO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a first-principles study of the low-temperature rhombohedral phase
of BaTiO$_3$ using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory. By employing
density-functional perturbation theory, we compute the onsite Hubbard $U$ for
Ti($3d$) states and the intersite Hubbard $V$ between Ti($3d$) and O($2p$)
states. We show that applying the onsite Hubbard $U$ correction alone to
Ti($3d$) states proves detrimental, as it suppresses the Ti($3d$)-O($2p$)
hybridization and drives the system towards a cubic phase. Conversely, when
both onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ are considered, the localized character of
the Ti($3d$) states is maintained, while also preserving the Ti($3d$)-O($2p$)
hybridization, restoring the rhombohedral phase of BaTiO$_3$. The generalized
PBEsol+$U$+$V$ functional yields remarkable agreement with experimental results
for the band gap and dielectric constant, while the optimized geometry is
slightly less accurate compared to PBEsol. Zone-center phonon frequencies and
Raman spectra, being significantly influenced by the underlying geometry,
demonstrate better agreement with experiments in the case of PBEsol, while
PBEsol+$U$+$V$ exhibits reduced accuracy, and the PBEsol+$U$ Raman spectrum
diverges remarkably from experimental data, highlighting the adverse impact of
the $U$ correction alone in BaTiO$_3$. Our findings underscore the promise of
the extended Hubbard PBEsol+$U$+$V$ functional with first-principles $U$ and
$V$ for the investigation of other ferroelectric perovskites with mixed
ionic-covalent interactions.

<h3>Beyond braid anyons: A lattice model for one-dimensional anyons with a  Galilean invariant continuum limit</h3>

Anyonic exchange statistics can emerge when the configuration space of
quantum particles is not simply-connected. Most famously, anyon statistics
arises for particles with hard-core two-body constraints in two dimensions.
Here, the exchange paths described by the braid group are associated to
non-trivial geometric phases, giving rise to abelian braid anyons. Hard-core
three-body constraints in one dimension (1D) also make the configuration space
of particles non-simply connected, and it was recently shown that this allows
for a different form of anyons with statistics given by the traid group instead
of the braid group. In this article we propose a first concrete model for such
traid anyons. We first construct a bosonic lattice model with number-dependent
Peierls phases which implement the desired geometric phases associated with
abelian representations of the traid group and then define anyonic operators so
that the Hamiltonian becomes local and quadratic with respect to them. The
ground-state of this traid-anyon-Hubbard model shows various indications of
emergent approximate Haldane exclusion statistics. The continuum limit results
in a Galilean invariant Hamiltonian with eigenstates that correspond to
previously constructed continuum traid-anyonic wave functions. This provides
not only an a-posteriori justification of our model, but also shows that our
construction serves as an intuitive approach to traid anyons. Moreover, it
contrasts with the non-Galilean invariant continuum limit of the anyon-Hubbard
model [Keilmann et al., Nat.\ Comm.~\textbf{2}, 361 (2011)] describing braid
anyons on a discrete 1D configuration space. We attribute this difference to
the fact that (unlike braid anyons) traid anyons are well defined also in the
continuum in 1D.

<h3>Irreversible entropy transport enhanced by fermionic superfluidity</h3>

<br>
<br>
The nature of the flow between two superfluids, as in the Josephson and
fountain effects, is often understood in terms of reversible flow carried by an
entropy-free, macroscopic wavefunction. While this wavefunction is responsible
for many intriguing properties of superfluids and superconductors, its
interplay with excitations in non-equilibrium situations is more subtle and
less understood. Here, we observe large concurrent flows--not only of particles
but also entropy--through a ballistic channel connecting two strongly
interacting fermionic superfluids, both showing similar nonlinear responses to
biases in chemical potential and temperature. We find that the entropy
transported per particle is much larger than the local entropy of the
equilibrium superfluid and is robust to changes in the channel's geometry. In
contrast, the timescales of advective and diffusive entropy transport vary
significantly with the channel geometry. In our setting, superfluidity
counterintuitively increases the speed of irreversible entropy transport. We
develop a phenomenological model describing the nonlinear dynamics within the
framework of generalised gradient dynamics, an extension of Onsager's theory of
irreversible processes. The presented approach to measure entropy currents may
help uncover novel mechanisms of heat transfer in superfluids and
superconducting devices.

<h3>Theoretical investigation of the lattice thermal conductivities of  II-IV-V2 pnictide semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ternary pnictides semiconductors with II-IV-V2 stoichiometry hold potential
as cost effective thermoelectric materials with suitable electronic transport
properties, but their lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) are typically
too high. Gaining insight into their vibrational properties is therefore
crucial to finding strategies to reduce $\kappa$ and achieve improved
thermoelectric performance. We present a theoretical exploration of the lattice
thermal conductivities for a set of pnictide semiconductors with ABX2
composition (A = Zn, Cd; B = Si, Ge, Sn; and X = P, As), using machine-learning
based regression algorithms to extract force constants from a reduced number of
density functional theory simulations, and then solving the Boltzmann transport
equation for phonons. Our results align well available experimental data,
decreasing the mean absolute error by ~3 Wm-1K-1 with respect to the best
previous set of theoretical predictions. Zn-based ternary pnictides have, on
average, more than double the thermal conductivity of the Cd-based compounds.
Anisotropic behaviour increases with the mass difference between A and B
cations, but while the nature of the anion does not affect the structural
anisotropy, the thermal conductivity anisotropy is typically higher for
arsenides than for phosphides. We identify compounds, like CdGeAs2, for which
nanostructuring to an affordable range of particle sizes could lead to values
low enough for thermoelectric applications.

<h3>Strong relevance of Zinc impurity in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome  quantum antiferromagnets: a variational study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04363</a>

<br>
<br>
Copper hydroxyhalide materials herbertsmithite ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$
and Zn-barlowite ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$FrBr are thought to be the best
realizations of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome quantum antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model and are widely believed to host a spin liquid ground state.
However, the exact nature of such a novel state of matter is still under strong
debate, partly due to the complication related to the occupation disorder
between the Zinc and the Copper ions in these systems. In particular, recent
nuclear magnetic resonance measurements indicate that the magnetic response of
the Kagome plane is significantly spatial inhomogeneous, even though the
content of the misplaced Zinc or Copper ions is believed to be very small. Here
we use extensive variational optimization to show that the well known
$U(1)$-Dirac spin liquid state is extremely sensitive to the introduction of
the nonmagnetic Zinc impurity in the Kagome plane. More specifically, we find
that the Zinc impurities can significantly reorganize the local spin
correlation pattern around them and induce strong spatial oscillation in the
magnetic response of the system. We argue that this is a general trend in
highly frustrated quantum magnet systems, in which the nonmagnetic impurity may
act as strongly relevant perturbation on the emergent resonating valence bond
structure in their spin liquid ground state. We also argue that the strong
spatial oscillation in the magnetic response should be attributed to the free
moment released by the doped Zinc ions and may serve as the smoking gun
evidence for the Dirac node in the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state on the Kagome
lattice.

<h3>Emergent learning in physical systems as feedback-based aging in a  glassy landscape</h3>

<br>
<i>Vidyesh Rao Anisetti, Ananth Kandala, J. M. Schwarz</i>
<br>
<br>
By training linear physical networks to learn linear transformations, we
discern how their physical properties evolve due to weight update rules. Our
findings highlight a striking similarity between the learning behaviors of such
networks and the processes of aging and memory formation in disordered and
glassy systems. We show that the learning dynamics resembles an aging process,
where the system relaxes in response to repeated application of the feedback
boundary forces in presence of an input force, thus encoding a memory of the
input-output relationship. With this relaxation comes an increase in the
correlation length, which is indicated by the two-point correlation function
for the components of the network. We also observe that the square root of the
mean-squared error as a function of epoch takes on a non-exponential form,
which is a typical feature of glassy systems. This physical interpretation
suggests that by encoding more detailed information into input and feedback
boundary forces, the process of emergent learning can be rather ubiquitous and,
thus, serve as a very early physical mechanism, from an evolutionary
standpoint, for learning in biological systems.

The spontaneous fluorescence rates of single-molecule emitters are typically
on the order of nanoseconds. However coupling them with plasmonic
nanostructures can substantially increase their fluorescence yields. The
confinement between the tip and sample of a scanning tunneling microscope
creates a tunable nanocavity, an ideal platform for exploring the yields and
excitation decay rates of single-molecule emitters depending on the coupling
strength to the nanocavity. With this setup we estimate the excitation
lifetimes from the direct time-resolved measurements of the fluorescence decays
of phthalocyanine adsorbates, decoupled from the metal substrates by ultrathin
NaCl layers. It is found that nanosecond-range lifetimes prevail for the
emitters away from the nanocavity, whereas for the tip approached to a
molecule, we find a substantial effect of the nanocavity coupling, which
reduces the lifetimes to a few picoseconds. An analysis is performed to
investigate the crossover between the far-field and tip-enhanced
photoluminescence regimes. This approach overcomes the drawbacks associated
with the estimation of lifetimes for single molecules from their respective
emission linewidths.

Freestanding tubular crystals offer a general description of crystalline
order on deformable surfaces with cylindrical topology, such as single-walled
carbon nanotubes, microtubules, and recently reported colloidal assemblies.
These systems exhibit a rich interplay between the crystal's helicity on its
periodic surface, the deformable geometry of that surface, and the motions of
topological defects within the crystal. Previously, in simulations of tubular
crystals as elastic networks, we found that dislocations in nontrivial patterns
can co-stabilize with kinks in the tube shape, producing mechanical
multistability. Here, we extend that work with detailed Langevin dynamics
simulations, in order to explore defect dynamics efficiently and without the
constraints imposed by elastic network models. Along with the predicted
multistability of dislocation glide, we find a variety of irreversible defect
transformations, including vacancy formation, particle extrusions, and
"reactions" that reorient dislocation pairs. Moreover, we report spontaneous
sequences of several such defect transformations, which are unique to tubular
crystals. We demonstrate a simple method for controlling these sequences
through a time-varying external force.

We show that electron interaction with the crystal lattice imposes stringent

<h3>A Comparative Study of Coherent and Incoherent Drives in Four-Level  Quantum Dot Based Spaser</h3>

In this article, we theoretically investigate a spaser (surface plasmon
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation), which consists of a
spherical silver nanoparticle surrounded by four-level gain medium of quantum
dots (QDs). The spaser system is pumped coherently and incoherently with the
same excitation rate, and the characteristics of coherent localized surface
plasmon (LSP) mode, thus produced, are compared for the two pumping scenarios.
We provide a detailed analytical expression for the steady state and show that
the incoherent pump is more suitable for the continuous spaser mode. The reason
is better understood by studying the temporal evolution of number of LSP (N_n
), where the oscillation of LSP starts early for incoherent drive and relaxes
to steady state with a large value of N_n. At a large pump rate, spaser curve
shows saturation. In addition, we have found that the resonance peak of spaser
field is independent of coherent as well as incoherent pumping, while the peak
amplitude of field depends on the pump rate.
