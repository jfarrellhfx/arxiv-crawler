<h3>Hydrodynamics of electron-hole fluid photogenerated in a mesoscopic  two-dimensional channel</h3>

<p>The dynamics of the diffusion flow of holes photoinjected into a mesoscopic
GaAs channel of variable width, where they, together with background electrons,
form a hydrodynamic electron-hole fluid, is studied using time-resolved
microphotoluminescence. It is found that the rate of recombination of
photoinjected holes, which is proportional to the rate of their flow, decreases
when holes pass through the expanded sections of the channel. In fact, this is
the Venturi effect, which consists in a decrease in the velocity of the fluid
in the expanded sections of the pipe. Moreover, a non-uniform diffusion
velocity profile is observed, similar to the parabolic Hagen-Poiseuille
velocity profile, which indicates a viscous hydrodynamic flow. It is shown that
in argeement with a theory, the magnetic field strongly suppresses the
viscosity of the electron-hole fluid. Additional evidence of the viscous nature
of the studied electron-hole fluid is the observed increase in the
recombination rate with increasing temperature, which is similar to the
decrease in the electrical resistance of viscous electrons with temperature.

<h3>Rescaled Mode-Coupling Scheme for the Quantitative Description of  Experimentally Observed Colloid Dynamics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04556</a>
<br>
</p><i>Joel Diaz Maier, Joachim Wagner</i>
<p>We describe experimentally observed collective dynamics in colloidal
suspensions of model hard-sphere particles using a modified mode coupling
theory (MCT). This rescaled MCT is capable to describe quantitatively the
wave-vector and time-dependent diffusion in these systems. Intermediate
scattering functions of liquid-like structured dispersions are determined by
means of static and dynamic light scattering experiments. The structure and
short-time dynamics of the systems can be described quantitatively employing a
multi-component Percus-Yevick ansatz for the partial structure factors and an
effective, one-component description of hydrodynamic interactions based on the
semi-analytical $\delta\gamma$-expansion. Combined with a recently proposed
empirical modification of MCT in which memory functions are calculated using
effective structure factors at rescaled number densities, the scheme is able to
model the collective dynamics over the entire accessible time and wave-vector
range and predicts the volume-fraction-dependence of long-time self-diffusion
coefficients and the zero-shear viscosity quantitatively. This highlights the
potential of MCT as a practical tool for the quantitative analysis and
prediction of experimental observations.

<h3>The Role of Geometry in Tailoring the Linear and Nonlinear Optical  Properties of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03963" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03963</a>
<br>
</p><i>Grigor A. Mantashian</i>
<p>The paper aims to reveal the relationship between the geometrical features
and linear and nonlinear optical properties of InAs quantum dots (QDs). This
problem is justified by the extreme variety offered by the recent advances in
growth techniques tailored to the attainment of QDs and nanostructures with
virtually any shape. To that end, the Finite Element Method in conjunction with
the Effective Mass Approximation and Envelope Function Approximation was
employed to solve the one-particle eigenproblems in domains with any complex
geometries. The paper explores nanoplatelets, spherical QDs, nanocones,
nanorods, nanotadpoles, and nanostars. It has been found that there is a clear
correlation between the complexity and symmetry of the QDs and their linear and
nonlinear absorption spectra for transitions between the electronic ground
state and the first three excited states.

<h3>Theory of Half-Integer Fractional Quantum Spin Hall Insulator Edges</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03964</a>
<br>
</p><i>Julian May-Mann, Ady Stern, Trithep Devakul</i>
<p>We study the edges of fractional quantum spin Hall insulators (FQSH) with
half-integer spin Hall conductance. These states can be viewed as symmetric
combinations of a spin-up and spin-down half-integer fractional quantum Hall
state (FQH) that are time-reversal invariant, and conserve the z-component of
spin. We consider the non-Abelian states based on the Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian,
PH-Pfaffian, and 221 FQH, and generic Abelian FQH. For strong enough
spin-conserving interactions, we find that all the non-Abelian and Abelian
edges flow to the same fixed point that consists of a single pair of charged
counter-propagating bosonic modes. If spin-conservation is broken, the Abelian
edge can be fully gapped in a time-reversal symmetric fashion. The non-Abelian
edge with broken spin-conservation remains gapless due to time-reversal
symmetry, and can flow to a new fixed point with a helical gapless pair of
Majorana fermions. We discuss the possible relevance of our results to the
recent observation of a half-integer edge conductance in twisted MoTe2.

<h3>Collective modes in terahertz field response of superconductors with  paramagnetic impurities</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03980" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03980</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yantao Li, Maxim Dzero</i>
<p>We consider a problem of nonlinear response to an external electromagnetic
radiation of conventional disordered superconductors which contain a small
amount of weak magnetic impurities. We focus on the diffusive limit and use
Usadel equation to analyze the collective excitations and obtain the dispersion
relations for the collective modes. We determine the resonant frequency and
dispersion of both amplitude and phase (Carlson-Goldman) modes for moderate
strength of magnetic scattering. We find that the Carlson-Goldman and
superconducting plasmon modes can only be excited at some finite value of the
threshold momentum which increases with an increase in spin-flip scattering
rate while the amplitude mode is diffusive and becomes strongly suppressed with
the increase in spin-flip scattering. The value of the threshold momentum is
determined by the distance between the two consecutive spin-flip scattering
events. Furthermore, we also find that the superconducting plasmon mode becomes
gapless in the presence of the pair breaking processes. Possible ways towards
experimental verification of our results are also discussed.

<h3>Quantum many-body scars and non-thermal behaviour in Fredkin spin chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03986</a>
<br>
</p><i>Luke Causer, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<p>We study the dynamics and thermalization of the Fredkin spin chain, a system
with local three-body interactions, particle conservation and explicit kinetic
constraints. We consider deformations away from its stochastic point in order
to tune between regimes where kinetic energy dominates and those where
potential energy does. By means of exact diagonalisation, perturbation theory
and variational matrix product states, we show that the stochastic point is
where a transition occurs between a phase of fast thermalization to one of slow
metastable (prethermal) dynamics. This change in relaxation is connected to the
emergence of additional kinetic constraints which lead to the fragmentation of
Hilbert space in the limit of a large potential energy. We also show that this
transition can lead to thermalization being evaded for special initial
conditions due to non-thermal eigenstates (akin to quantum many-body scars). We
provide clear evidence for the existence of these non-thermal states for large
system sizes even when far from the large-potential-energy limit, and explain
their connection to the emergent kinetic constraints.

<h3>Worldsheet patching, 1-form symmetries, and "Landau-star" phase  transitions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04025" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04025</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pablo Serna, Andrés M. Somoza, Adam Nahum</i>
<p>The analysis of phase transitions of gauge theories has relied heavily on
simplifications that arise at the boundaries of phase diagrams, where certain
excitations are forbidden. Taking 2+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory
as an example, the simplification can be visualized geometrically: on the phase
diagram boundaries the partition function is an ensemble of closed membranes.
More generally, however, the membranes have "holes" in them, representing
worldlines of virtual anyon excitations. If the holes are of a finite size,
then typically they do not affect the universality class, but they destroy
microscopic (higher-form) symmetries and microscopic (string) observables. We
demonstrate how these symmetries and observables can be restored using a
"membrane patching" procedure, which maps the ensemble of membranes back to an
ensemble of closed membranes. (This is closely related to the idea of gauge
fixing in the "minimal gauge", though not equivalent.) Membrane patching makes
the emergence of higher symmetry concrete. Performing patching in a Monte Carlo
simulation with an appropriate algorithm, we show that it gives access to
numerically useful observables. For example, the confinement transition can be
analyzed using a correlation function that is a power law at the critical
point. We analyze the quasi-locality of the patching procedure and discuss what
happens at a self-dual multicritical point in the gauge-Higgs model, where the
lengthscale $\ell$ characterizing the holes diverges.

<h3>Power efficiency of Hall-like devices: comparison between reciprocal and  anti-reciprocal Onsager relations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04059</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jean-Eric Wegrowe, Luqian Zhou, Sariah Al Saati</i>
<p>Two well-known Hall-like effects are occurring in ferromagnets: the Anomalous
Hall effect and the Planar Hall effect. The former is analogous to the
classical Hall effect and is defined by the Onsager reciprocity relation of the
second kind (antisymmetric conductivity matrix), while the latter is defined by
the Onsager reciprocity relation of the first kind (symmetric conductivity
matrix). The difference is fundamental, as it is based on time-invariance
symmetry breaking at the microscopic scale. We study the Hall current generated
in both cases, together with the power that can be extracted from the edges of
Hall device. The expressions of the distribution of the electric currents, the
distribution of electric carriers, and the power efficiencies (i.e. the power
that can be injected into a load circuit) are derived at stationary regime from
a variational method based on the second law of thermodynamics. It is shown
that the distribution of the transverse Hall-current is identical in both cases
but the longitudinal current and the power dissipated differ at the second
order in the Hall angle.

<h3>A contact map method to capture the features of knot conformations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04060</a>
<br>
</p><i>Neda Abbasi Taklimi, Franco Ferrari, Marcin Radosław Piątek, Luca Tubiana</i>
<p>Inspired by recent advances in the chromosome capture techniques, a method is
proposed to study the structural organization of systems of polymers rings with
topological constraints.To this purpose, the system is divided into
compartments and a simple condition is provided in order to determine if two
compartments are in contact or not. Next, a set of contact matrices $\bar
T_{ab}$ is defined that count how many times during a simulation a compartment
$a$ was found in contact with a non-contiguous compartment $b$ in conformations
with a given energy or temperature. Similar strategies based on correlation
maps have been applied to the study of knotted polymers in the recent past. The
advantage of the present approach is that is coupled with the Wang-Landau
algorithm. Once the density of states is computed, it is possible to generate
the contact matrices at any temperature. This gives an immediate overview over
the changes of phases that polymer systems undergo. The information on the
structure of knotted polymers and links stored in the contact matrices is the
result of averaging hundred of billions of conformations and visualized by
means of colormaps. The obtained color patterns allow to identify the main
properties of the structure of the system under investigation at any
temperature. The method is applied to detect the structural rearrangements
following the phase transitions of a knotted polymer ring and a circular
polycatenane composed by four rings in a solution. It is shown that the
colormaps have a finite number of patterns that can be clearly associated with
the different phases of these systems. Colormaps also bring new knowledge, for
instance predicting the average number of tails appearing in the conformations
of the considered polymers at a given temperature.

<h3>Aggregate morphing of self-aligining soft active disks in semi-confined  geometry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04075</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anshika Chugh, Soumen De Karmakar, Rajaraman Ganesh</i>
<p>We study the dependence of alignment and confinement on the aggregate
morphology of self-aligning soft disks in a planer box geometry confined along
y direction. We show that the wall accumulation of aggregates becomes
non-uniform upon increase in alignment strength and decrease in box width. The
height of these structures is found to be a non-monotonic function of alignment
strength. Additionally, we identify two distinct categories of wall aggregates:
layered and non-layered structures each exhibiting distinct local structural
properties. For non-layered structures, local properties stay nearly constant
as we move away from the boundary, while for layered structures, they increase
with distance from the boundary. Our analysis shows that active pressure
difference is a useful indicator for different aggregate morphologies and the
peaks in the pressure curve are indicative of the average and minimum height of
the structure.

<h3>Atom probe tomography: a local probe for chemical bonds in solids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04093" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04093</a>
<br>
</p><i>Oana Cojocaru-Mirédin, Yuan Yu, Jan Köttgen, Tanmoy Ghosh, Carl-Friedrich Schön, Shuai Han, Chongjian Zhou, Matthias Wuttig</i>
<p>Atom probe tomography is frequently employed to characterize the elemental
distribution in solids with atomic resolution. Here we review and discuss the
potential of this technique to locally probe chemical bonds. Two processes
characterize the bond rupture in laser-assisted field emission, the probability
of molecular ions, i.e. the probability that molecular ions (PMI) are
evaporated instead of single (atomic) ions, and the probability of multiple
events, i.e. the correlated field-evaporation of more than a single fragment
(PME) upon laser- or voltage pulse excitation. Here we demonstrate that one can
clearly distinguish solids with metallic, covalent, and metavalent bonds based
on their bond rupture, i.e. their PME and PMI values. Differences in the field
penetration depth can largely explain these differences in bond breaking. These
findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials,
since they allow a quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale, as
will be shown for several examples. These possibilities would even justify
calling the present approach bonding probe tomography (BPT).

<h3>Flat-band hybridization between $f$ and $d$ states near the Fermi energy  of SmCoIn$_5$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04097</a>
<br>
</p><i>David W. Tam, Nicola Colonna, Fatima Alarab, Vladimir N. Strocov, Dariusz Jakub Gawryluk, Ekaterina Pomjakushina, Michel Kenzelmann</i>
<p>We present high-quality angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and density
functional theory calculations (DFT+U) of SmCoIn$_5$. We find broad agreement
with previously published studies of LaCoIn$_5$ and CeCoIn$_5$, confirming that
the Sm $4f$ electrons are mostly localized. Nevertheless, our model is
consistent with an additional delocalized Sm component, stemming from
hybridization between the $4f$ electrons and the metallic bands at "hot spot"
positions in the Brillouin zone. The dominant hot spot, called $\gamma_Z$, is
similar to a source of delocalized $f$ states found in previous experimental
and theoretical studies of CeCoIn$_5$. In this work, we identify and focus on
the role of the Co $d$ states in exploring the relationship between heavy
quasiparticles and the magnetic interactions in SmCoIn$_5$, which lead to a
magnetically ordered ground state from within an intermediate valence scenario.
Specifically, we find a globally flat band consisting of Co $d$ states near
$E=-0.7$ eV, indicating the possibility of enhanced electronic and magnetic
interactions in the "115" family of materials through localization in the Co
layer, and we discuss a possible origin in geometric frustration. We also show
that the delocalized Sm $4f$ states can hybridize directly with the Co
$3d_{xz}$/$3d_{yz}$ orbitals, which occurs in our model at the Brillouin zone
boundary point $R$ in a band that is locally flat and touches the Fermi level
from above. Our work identifies microscopic ingredients for additional magnetic
interactions in the "115" materials beyond the RKKY mechanism, and strongly
suggests that the Co $d$ bands are an important ingredient in the formation of
both magnetic and superconducting ground states.

<h3>How do polymers stretch in capillary-driven extensional flows?</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04103</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vincenzo Calabrese, Amy Q. Shen, Simon J. Haward</i>
<p>Measurements of the capillary-driven thinning and breakup of fluid filaments
are widely used to extract extensional rheological properties of complex
materials. For viscoelastic (e.g., polymeric) fluids, the determination of the
longest relaxation time depends on several assumptions concerning the polymeric
response to the flow that are derived from constitutive models. Our capillary
thinning experiments using polymeric fluids with a wide range of extensibility,
suggest that these assumptions are likely only valid for highly extensible
polymers but do not hold in general. For polymers with relatively low
extensibility, such as polyectrolytes in salt-free media, conventional
extrapolation of the longest relaxation time from capillary thinning techniques
leads to a significant underestimation.

<p>Atomically thin cuprates exhibiting a superconducting phase transition
temperature similar to bulk have recently been realized, although the device
fabrication remains a challenge and limits the potential for many novel studies
and applications. Here we use an optical pump-probe approach to noninvasively
study the unconventional superconductivity in atomically thin
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_{0.92}$Y$_{0.08}$Cu$_2$O$_{8+{\delta}}$ (Y-Bi2212). Apart from
finding an optical response due to the superconducting phase transition that is
similar to bulk Y-Bi2212, we observe that the sign and amplitude of the
pump-probe signal in the atomically thin flake vary significantly in different
dielectric environments depending on the nature of the optical excitation. By
exploiting the spatial resolution of the optical probe, we uncover the
exceptional sensitivity of monolayer Y-Bi2212 to the environment. Our results
provide the first optical evidence for the intralayer nature of the
superconducting condensate in Bi2212, and highlight the role of double-sided
encapsulation in preserving superconductivity in atomically thin cuprates.

<h3>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$  Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhiyu Jiang, Ryo Okamoto, Hideaki Obuse</i>
<p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their
Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been
classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators
in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that
non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian
system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological
phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate
this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits
point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual
symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this
quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

<h3>A generic model with unconventional Rashba bands and giant spin galvanic  effect</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04155" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04155</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xinliang Huang, Yuhang Xiao, Rui Song, Ning Hao</i>
<p>In two-dimensional system, Rashba spin-orbit coupling can lift spin
degeneracy and gives the opposite spin chirality of two split Fermi circles
from two Rashba bands. Here, we propose a generic model which can produce
unconventional Rashba bands. In such a case, the two Fermi circles from two
bands have the same spin chirality. When various interactions are taken into
account, many unique physics can emerge in case of unconventional Rashba bands
in comparison with in case of conventional Rashba bands. For instance, we study
the spin galvanic effect by considering two cases with potential impurity
scattering and magnetic impurity scattering, respectively. In both cases, we
find the efficiency of spin galvanic effect is strongly enhanced in
unconventional Rashba bands in comparison with conventional Rashba bands. More
intriguingly, we find the effeiciency of conventional Rashba bands is
insensitive to potential or magnetic impurity scattering. However, such
efficiency of uncoventional Rashba bands can be further enhanced by the
magnetic impurity scattering in comparison with the potential impurity
scattering. Thus, the unconventional Rashba bands can give giant spin galvanic
effect. These results show that this model is useful to explore abnormal
physics in the systems with unconventional Rashba bands.

<h3>Nonequilibrium magnonic thermal transport engineering</h3>

<p>Thermal conductivity, a fundamental parameter characterizing thermal
transport in solids, is typically determined by electron and phonon transport.
Although other transport properties including electrical conductivity and
thermoelectric conversion coefficients have material-specific values, it is
known that thermal conductivity can be modulated artificially via phonon
engineering techniques. Here, we demonstrate another way of artificially
modulating the heat conduction in solids: magnonic thermal transport
engineering. The time-domain thermoreflectance measurements using ferromagnetic
metal/insulator junction systems reveal that the thermal conductivity of the
ferromagnetic metals and interfacial thermal conductance vary significantly
depending on the spatial distribution of nonequilibrium spin currents.
Systematic measurements of the thermal transport properties with changing the
boundary conditions for spin currents show that the observed thermal transport
modulation stems from magnon origin. This observation unveils that magnons
significantly contribute to the heat conduction even in ferromagnetic metals at
room temperature, upsetting the conventional wisdom that the thermal
conductivity mediated by magnons is very small in metals except at low
temperatures. The magnonic thermal transport engineering offers a new principle
and method for active thermal management.

<p>We report X-ray diffraction and resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS)
studies on two $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ crystals with distinct magnetic transition
temperatures: T$_{N}$=7.3K and 6.5K. We find that the sample with T$_{N}$=6.5K
exhibits a high degree of structural twinning at low temperature, whereas the
T$_{N}$=7.3K sample primarily comprises a single domain of R$\bar{3}$.
Notwithstanding, both samples exhibit an identical zigzag magnetic structure,
with magnetic moments pointing away from the honeycomb plane by
$\alpha=31(2)^{\circ}$. We argue that the identical ordered moment directions
in these samples suggest that the intralayer magnetic Hamiltonian remains
mostly unchanged regardless of T$_{N}$.

<p>One of the main degradation mechanisms of methylammonium lead iodine (MAPI),
which is an important material for perovskite based solar cells, is the
migration of iodide ions. It is believed that this phenomenon is in fact
dominated by the diffusion of iodide vacancies. In this paper, we suggest that
the addition of a small amount of OH$^-$ ions can help suppress the migration
of iodide and increase the overall stability of the material. Through the use
of molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the OH$^-$ ions can bind to the
positively charged iodide vacancies and can block the access of the negative
iodide ions into those vacancies.

<p>It has been theoretically predicted that perturbation of the Berry curvature
by electromagnetic fields gives rise to intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall
effects that are independent of scattering. Two types of nonlinear anomalous
Hall effects are expected. The electric nonlinear Hall effect has recently
begun to receive attention, while very few studies are concerned with the
magneto-nonlinear Hall effect. Here, we combine experiment and first-principles
calculations to show that the kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ displays such a
magneto-nonlinear Hall effect. By systematic field angular and
temperature-dependent transport measurements, we unambiguously identify a large
anomalous Hall current that is linear in both applied in-plane electric and
magnetic fields, utilizing a unique in-plane configuration. We clarify its
dominant orbital origin and connect it to the magneto-nonlinear Hall effect.
The effect is governed by the intrinsic quantum geometric properties of Bloch
electrons. Our results demonstrate the significance of the quantum geometry of
electron wave functions from the orbital degree of freedom and open up a new
direction in Hall transport effects.

<p>We study a model of electrons moving in a parent band of uniform Berry
curvature. At sufficiently high parent Berry curvature, we show that strong
repulsive interactions generically leads to the formation of an anomalous Hall
crystal: a topological state with spontaneously broken continuous translation
symmetry. Our results are established via a mapping to a problem of Wigner
crystallization in a regular 2D electron gas. We further show that the
resulting quasiparticle bands are "ideal" for realizing fractionalized
topological states. Our theory provides a unified perspective for understanding
several aspects of the recently observed integer and fractional quantum

<p>Antiferromagnetic(AFM) skyrmions have been in the spotlight as ideal
topological magnetic bits. Although they are topologically protected, they do
not exhibit the skyrmion Hall effect unlike the ferromagnetic ones. Thus, AFM
skyrmions are considered to provide a better control of the skyrmion's motion
due to the absence of the skyrmion Magnus effect. In this work, we propose a
possible realization of controllable AFM skyrmions in a twisted Moir\'e magnet.
The tunability of Moir\'e materials is not only a good platform for the
provision of rich phases, but also for the stabilization of skyrmion phase. We
investigate the ground state of twisted bilayer AFM system by solving the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in a continuum model. We show that the AFM
skyrmions are stabilized even in the absence of the external/dipolar magnetic
field, as a consequence of the interplay of interlayer coupling,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and Ising anisotropy. More
interestingly, due to the magnetoelectric effect, the application of an
external electric field locally stabilizes the skyrmions in the twisted bilayer
AFM systems, even in the absence of DM interaction. It also allows the skyrmion
helicity to change continuously when both the DM interaction and an electric
field are present. We show the phase diagram with respect to the strength of
interlayer coupling, the DM interaction and an electric field. Our results
suggest the possibility of using AFM skyrmions as stable, controllable
topological magnetic bits.

<h3>Phonon state tomography of electron correlation dynamics in optically  excited solids</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M. Moroder, M. Mitrano, U. Schollwöck, S. Paeckel, J. Sous</i>
<p>We introduce phonon state tomography (PST) as a diagnostic probe of electron
dynamics in solids whose phonons are optically excited by a laser pulse at an
initial time. Using a projected-purified matrix-product states (PP-MPS)
algorithm, PST decomposes the exact correlated electron-phonon wavefunction
into contributions from purely electronic states corresponding to statistically
typical configurations of the optically accessible phononic response, enabling
a 'tomographic' reconstruction of the electronic dynamics generated by the
phonons. Thus, PST may be used to diagnose electronic behavior in experiments
that access only the phonon response, such as thermal diffuse x-ray and
electron scattering. To demonstrate the usefulness of PST, we study the
dynamics of a metal whose infrared phonons are excited by an optical pulse at
initial time and use it to simulate the sample-averaged momentum-resolved
phonon occupancy as would be measured experimentally and accurately reconstruct
the electronic double occupancy and staggered magnetization. We also use PST to
analyze the influence of different pulse shapes on the light-induced
enhancement and suppression of electronic correlations.

<h3>Performance Assessment of Universal Machine Learning Interatomic  Potentials: Challenges and Directions for Materials' Surfaces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04217</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bruno Focassio, Luis Paulo Mezzina Freitas, Gabriel R. Schleder</i>
<p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are one of the main
techniques in the materials science toolbox, able to bridge ab initio accuracy
with the computational efficiency of classical force fields. This allows
simulations ranging from atoms, molecules, and biosystems, to solid and bulk
materials, surfaces, nanomaterials, and their interfaces and complex
interactions. A recent class of advanced MLIPs, which use equivariant
representations and deep graph neural networks, is known as universal models.
These models are proposed as foundational models suitable for any system,
covering most elements from the periodic table. Current universal MLIPs (UIPs)
have been trained with the largest consistent dataset available nowadays.
However, these are composed mostly of bulk materials' DFT calculations. In this
article, we assess the universality of all openly available UIPs, namely MACE,
CHGNet, and M3GNet, in a representative task of generalization: calculation of
surface energies. We find that the out-of-the-box foundational models have
significant shortcomings in this task, with errors correlated to the total
energy of surface simulations, having an out-of-domain distance from the
training dataset. Our results show that while UIPs are an efficient starting
point for fine-tuning specialized models, we envision the potential of
increasing the coverage of the materials space towards universal training
datasets for MLIPs.

<h3>Pressure tuning of hydrogen bond ordering in the metal-organic framework  [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04241" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04241</a>
<br>
</p><i>Na Su, Yinina Ma, Shuang Liu, Wei Wu, Jianlin Luo, Young Sun</i>
<p>The influence of pressure on the hydrogen bond ordering in the perovskite
metal-organic framework [(CH3)2NH2]Mn(HCOO)3 has been investigated by
dielectric, pyroelectric adn magnetic measurements in a piston-cylinder cell.
Under ambient pressure the ordering of hydrogen bonds takes place at TC = 188 K
and induces a first-order ferroelectric phase transition. With increasing
pressure to p = 3.92 kbar, the order-disorder transition shifts to a lower
temperature and retains the first-order ferroelectric nature. However, under
higher pressures, the ordering process of hydrogen bonds is split into two
transitions: a broad antiferroelectric transition at high temperature and a
first-order ferroelectric transition at low temperature. With increasing
pressure, the antiferroelectric phase is enhanced whereas the ferroelectric
phase is greatly suppressed, which implies that compression of the perovskite
framework favors antiparallel arrangement of the hydrogen bonds. The canted
anti-ferromagnetic transition was almost unchanged when pressure up to 10.85
kbar. Our study demonstrated that the perovskite metal-organic frameworks are
more sensitive to external pressure than conventional perovskite oxides so that
their electric properties can be easily tuned by pressure.

<h3>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</a>
<br>
</p><i>Oleg Evnin, Weerawit Horinouchi</i>
<p>In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked
statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a
prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular
Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield
estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the
Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the
series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact
formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian
integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral
representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we
perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the
saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these
saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to
significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs.
This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.

<h3>Resonant Quantum Magnetodielectric Effect in Multiferroic Metal-Organic  Framework [CH3NH3]Co(HCOO)3</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Na Su, Shuang Liu, Yingjie He, Yan Liu, Huixia Fu, Yi-Sheng Chai, Young Sun</i>
<p>We report the observation of both resonant quantum tunneling of magnetization
(RQTM) and resonant quantum magnetodielectric (RQMD) effect in the perovskite
multiferroic metal-organic framework [CH3NH3]Co(HCOO)3. An intrinsic magnetic
phase separation emerges at low temperatures due to hydrogen-bond-modified long
range super-exchange interaction, leading to the coexistence of canted
antiferromagnetic order and single-ion magnet. Subsequently, a stair-shaped
magnetic hysteresis loop along the [101] direction characterizing the RQTM
appears below the magnetic blocking temperature. More interestingly, the
magnetic field dependence of dielectric permittivity exhibits pronounced
negative peaks at the critical fields corresponding to the RQTM, a phenomenon
termed the RQMD effect which enables electrical detection of the RQTM. These
intriguing properties make the multiferroic metal-organic framework a promising
candidate for solid-state quantum computing.

<p>We investigate the impacts of the quantum geometry of Bloch states,
specifically through the band-resolved quantum-metric tensor, on Cooper pairing
and flat-band superconductivity in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-Hubbard
model. First we analyze the low-lying two-body spectrum exactly, and show that
the pairing order parameter is uniform in this four-band lattice. This allowed
us to establish direct relations between the superfluid weight of a multiband
superconductor and ($i$) the effective mass of the lowest-lying two-body branch
at zero temperature, ($ii$) the kinetic coefficient of the Ginzburg-Landau
theory in proximity to the critical temperature, and ($iii$) the velocity of
the low-energy Goldstone modes at zero temperature. Furthermore, we perform a
comprehensive numerical analysis of the superfluid weight and Goldstone modes,
exploring both their conventional and geometric components at zero temperature.

crystallographic axis in the crossover region from the two- to

phases and physical observables, we describe the system in the framework of the
Fermi-Hubbard model and apply dynamical mean-field theory. We show that in two
limiting cases of anisotropy there are two phases with different
antiferromagnetic orderings in the zero temperature limit and determine a
region of their coexistence. We also study the stability regions of different
magnetically-ordered states and density profiles of the gas in the harmonic

<h3>Structural disorder-induced topological phase transitions in  quasicrystals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tan Peng, Yong-Chen Xiong, Chun-Bo Hua, Zheng-Rong Liu, Xiaolu Zhu, Wei Cao, Fang Lv, Yue Hou, Bin Zhou, Ziyu Wang, Rui Xiong</i>
<p>Recently, the structural disorder-induced topological phase transitions in
periodic systems have attracted much attention. However, in aperiodic systems
such as quasicrystalline systems, the interplay between structural disorder and
band topology is still unclear. In this work, we investigate the effects of
structural disorder on a quantum spin Hall insulator phase and a higher-order
topological phase in a two-dimensional Amman-Beenker tiling quasicrystalline
lattice, respectively. We demonstrate that the structural disorder can induce a
topological phase transition from a quasicrystalline normal insulator phase to
an amorphous quantum spin Hall insulator phase, which is confirmed by bulk gap
closing and reopening, robust edge states, quantized spin Bott index and
conductance. Furthermore, the structural disorder-induced higher-order
topological phase transition from a quasicrystalline normal insulator phase to
an amorphous higher-order topological phase characterized by quantized
quadrupole moment and topological corner states is also found. More strikingly,
the disorder-induced higher-order topological insulator with eight corner
states represents a distinctive topological state that eludes realization in
conventional crystalline systems. Our work extends the study of the interplay
between disorder effects and topologies to quasicrystalline and amorphous
systems.

<p>Currently, many ab initio codes are being prepared for exascale computing. A

real-time time-dependent density functional theory in the full-potential

dimensionality. Following the strategy described here, calculations can run
orders of magnitude faster than before. We demonstrate this with the molecules
H$_2$ and CO, achieving speedups between 98 to over 50,000. We also present an
example where conventional calculations would be particularly costly, namely
the inorganic/organic heterostructure of pyridine physisorbed on monolayer

<h3>Insight into properties of sizable glass former from volumetric  measurements</h3>

</p><i>Marzena Rams-Baron, Alfred Blazytko, Riccardo Casalini, Marian Paluch</i>
<p>Sizable glass formers feature numerous unique properties and potential
applications, but many questions regarding their glass transition dynamics have
not been resolved yet. Here we analyzed structural relaxation times measured as
a function of temperature and pressure in combination with the equation of
state obtained from pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) measurements. Despite
evidence from previous dielectric studies indicating a remarkable sensitivity
of supercooled dynamics to compression, and contrary to intuition, our results
demonstrated the temperate proof for the almost equivalent importance of
thermal energy and free volume fluctuations in controlling reorientation
dynamics of sizable molecules. The found scaling exponent equals 3.0 and Ev/Ep
ratio of 0.6 were typical for glass-forming materials with relaxation dynamics
determined by both effects with a minor advantage of thermal fluctuations
involvement. It shows that the high values of key parameters characterizing the
sensitivity of the glass transition dynamics to pressure changes, i.e.
activation volume and dTg/dP, are not a valid premise for a remarkable
contribution of volume on glass transition dynamics.

</p><i>Feng Jin, Wei Ren, Mingshu Tan, Mingtai Xie, Bingru Lu, Zheng Zhang, Jianting Ji, Qingming Zhang</i>
<p>The stacking degree of freedom is a crucial factor in tuning material
properties and has been extensively investigated in layered materials. The
kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ was recently discovered to exhibit a
three-dimensional CDW phase below TCDW ~94 K. Despite the thorough
investigation of in-plane modulation, the out-of-plane modulation has remained
ambiguous. Here, our polarization- and temperature-dependent Raman measurements
reveal the breaking of C$_6$ rotational symmetry and the presence of three
distinct domains oriented at approximately 120{\deg}to each other. The
observations demonstrate that the CDW phase can be naturally explained as a 2c
staggered order phase with adjacent layers exhibiting a relative ${\pi}$ phase
shift. Further, we discover a first-order structural phase transition at
approximately 65 K and suggest that it is a stacking order-disorder phase
transition due to stacking fault, supported by the thermal hysteresis behavior
of a Cs-related phonon mode. Our findings highlight the significance of the
stacking degree of freedom in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and offer structural insights to
comprehend the entanglement between superconductivity and CDW.

industrial Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 absorbers, substituting less than 10% of the copper
with silver, using absolute photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence
spectroscopy. Silver improves the grain size and promotes the interdiffusion of
Ga and In across the depth of the absorber, resulting in a smoother band gap
gradient. However, a certain lateral inhomogeneity is observed near the front
and back sides. The non-radiative losses in the bare absorbers are reduced by
up to 30 meV.

</p><i>A. J. Chaves, D. R. da Costa, F. M. Peeters, Nuno M. R. Peres</i>
<p>Magnetized ferromagnetic disks or wires support strong inhomogeneous fields
in their borders. Such magnetic fields create an effective potential, due to
Zeeman and diamagnetic contributions, that can localize charge carriers. For
the case of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, this potential
can valley-localize excitons due to the Zeeman term, which breaks the valley
symmetry. We show that the diamagnetic term is negligible when compared to the
Zeeman term for monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. The latter is
responsible for trapping excitons near the magnetized structure border with
valley-dependent characteristics, in which, for one of the valleys, the exciton
is confined inside the disk, while for the other, it is outside. This spatial
valley separation of exciton can be probed by circularly polarized light, and
moreover, we show that the inhomogeneous magnetic field magnitude, the
dielectric environment, and the magnetized structure parameters can tailor the
spatial separation of the exciton wavefunctions.

<p>The study of 3D magnetic nanostructures has uncovered a range of rich
phenomena including the stabilization and control of topological spin textures
using nanoscale curvature, dynamic effects allowing controlled spin-wave
emission, and novel ground states enabled by collective 3D frustrated
interactions. From a technological perspective, 3D nanostructures offer routes
to ultrahigh density data storage, massive interconnectivity within
neuromorphic devices, as well as applications within health technologies, such
as mechanical induction of stem cell differentiation. However, the fabrication
of 3D nanomagnetic systems with feature sizes down to 10 nm poses a significant
challenge. In this work we present a means of fabricating sub-100 nm 3D
ferromagnetic nanowires, with both cross-sectional and longitudinal curvature,
using two-photon lithography at a wavelength of 405 nm, combined with
conventional deposition. Physical characterization illustrates that
nanostructures with lateral features as low as 70 nm can be rapidly and
reproducibly fabricated. A range of novel domain walls, with anti-vortex
textures, coupled transverse textures, and hybrid vortex/anti-vortex textures
are found to be enabled by the cross-sectional curvature of the system, as
demonstrated by finite-element micromagnetic simulations. Magnetic force
microscopy experiments in an externally applied magnetic field are used to
image the injection and pinning of domain walls in the 3D magnetic nanowire. At
specific field values, domain walls are observed to hop from trap to trap,
providing a direct means to probe the local energy landscape. A simple model is
presented demonstrating that thickness gradients and local roughness dictate
the variation of pinning probability across the wire.

<p>We investigate supercurrent nonreciprocal effects in a superconducting
weak-link hosting distinct types of vortices. We demonstrate how the winding
number of the vortex, its spatial configuration and the shape of the
superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent
rectification. We find a general criterion for the vortex pattern to maximize
the rectification amplitude of the supercurrent. The underlying strategy is the
search of specific vortex core position yielding a vanishing amplitude of the
supercurrent first harmonic. We also prove that supercurrent nonreciprocal
effects can be used to diagnose high-winding vortex and to distinguish between
different types of vorticity. Our results thus provide a toolkit to control the
supercurrent rectification by means of vortex phase textures and nonreciprocal
signatures to detect vortex states with nonstandard phase patterns.

<p>Spin-phonon interaction plays an important role in 2D magnetic materials and
motivates the development of next-generation spin- and charge-dependent
microelectronic devices. Understanding the spin-phonon interaction by tuning
the growth parameter of single crystal Cr$_2Te_3$, a robust quasi-2D room
temperature magnetic material, is crucial for spintronic devices. The synthesis
of single crystal 2D Cr$_2Te_3$ flakes on a Si substrate from co-deposited thin
film by plasma annealing techniques is a significant achievement. The
temperature dependence and polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy with
support of density functional theory classified lattice symmetry operations
were used to identify the phonon modes to investigate the spin/electron-phonon
interactions in Cr$_2Te_3$. The mean-field theory model in single crystal
Cr$_2Te_3$ is employed to quantify the spin-phonon interaction and correlate
with in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic behavior. The observation of a positive
correlation between phonon mode frequency and spin-phonon interaction strength
in single crystal Cr$_2Te_3$ can be a potential candidate for spintronic
applications.

ZrAs$_2$ stands out, characterized by its nodal lines forming continuous loops
in momentum space, governed by non-symmorphic symmetries. This study integrates
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to explore the electronic states of ZrAs$_2$. In
ARPES scans, we observed a distinctive nodal loop structure observed at lower
excitation energies of 30 and 50 eV. Our results, supported by calculations
based on DFT, unveil symmetry-enforced Dirac-like band crossings anchored at
specific points in the Brillouin zone, with particular emphasis on the S point.
Surface bands and bulk states near the crossing are elucidated through slab
calculations, corroborating experimental findings. DFT calculations also show
the existence of several spin-orbit coupling (SOC) resilient semi-Dirac
crossings pinned at Z point. This comprehensive investigation sheds light on
the intricate electronic behaviors of ZrAs$_2$ with the involved symmetries,
important for fundamental understanding of topological nodal line semimetals.

<br>
</p><i>Ádám Bácsi, Rok Žitko</i>
<p>The $P(E)$ theory describes inelastic tunneling of particles through
junctions integrated into an electric circuit. The inelasticity stems from the
interaction between the photonic field of the circuit and the tunneling
particles possessing electric charge. In the conventional approach to the
$P(E)$ theory, the tunneling rate and the electric current through the junction
are derived using Fermi's golden rule. The derivation is carried out to leading
order in the tunnel coupling between the leads and includes an averaging over
the environmental photonic degrees of freedom. Tracing out the environmental
degrees of freedom is also commonly used for open quantum systems when deriving
dynamical equations such as the Lindbladian. In this work, we reveal the
relations between the $P(E)$ theory and the Lindbladian dynamics. We
demonstrate that the assumptions of the Fermi's golden rule are essentially
equivalent with the Born-Markovian approximation used in the Lindbladian
formalism. The resulting quantum master equation enables us to obtain not only
the electric current but various other quantities, including for instance the
heat current parametrized by the same $P(E)$ function, in a systematic and
convenient way.

</p><i>Jiong-Hang Liang, Tian-Xing Hu, D. Wu, Zheng-Mao Sheng, J. Zhang</i>
<p>Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is widely used for
understanding and predicting properties and behaviors of matter. As one of the
fundamental theorems in TDDFT, van Leeuwen's theorem [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 3863
(1999)] guarantees how to construct a unique potential with the same one-body
density evolution. Here we extend van Leeuwen's theorem by exploring truncation
criteria in BBGKY-hierarchy. Our generalized theorem demonstrates the existence
of a unique non-local potential to accurately reconstruct the multi-body
density evolution in binary interacting systems. Under non-stringent
conditions, truncation of the BBGKY-hierarchy equations aligns with the
behavior of multi-body density evolution, and maintains consistency in the
reduced equations. As one of applications within the extended TDDFT supported
by our theorem, multiple excitation energy can be typically solved as the
eigenvalue of a generalized Casida's equation. The extended TDDFT provides an
accurate and first-principle framework capable of describing the kinetic
processes of correlated system, including strongly coupled particle transport,
multiple excitation and ionization processes.

as well as single-crystal neutron diffraction to explore temperature-field
phase diagram of the anisotropic honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4)_2$. Our data
reveal four distinct ordered states observed for in-plane magnetic fields. Of
particular interest is the narrow region between 0.51 and 0.55 T that separates
the up-up-down order from the fully polarized state and coincides with the
field range where signatures of the spin-liquid behavior have been reported. We
show that magnetic Bragg peaks persist in this intermediate phase, thus ruling
out its spin-liquid nature. However, the simultaneous nonmonotonic evolution of
nuclear Bragg peaks suggests the involvement of the lattice, witnessed also in
other regions of the phase diagram where large changes in the sample length are
observed upon entering the magnetically ordered states. Our data highlight the
importance of lattice effects in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4)_2$.

proteins. Our results show that THz pulses and a positive static field trigger
controlled evaporation of silica matrices, enabling 4D imaging with chemical
sensitivity comparable to UV laser-assisted APT. To support the interpretation
of these experimental results, we devise a computational model based on
time-dependent density functional theory to describe the interaction between
silica matrices and THz radiation. This model captures the nonlinear dynamics
driven by THz-pulses and the interplay between the THz source and the static
electric field in real time. This interdisciplinary approach expands the
capabilities of APT and holds promise for other THz-based analyses offering new
insights into material dynamics in complex biological environments.

<h3>Entanglement asymmetry and quantum Mpemba effect in two-dimensional  free-fermion systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04486</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shion Yamashika, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese</i>
<p>The quantum Mpemba effect is the counter-intuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon
wherein the dynamic restoration of a broken symmetry occurs more rapidly when
the initial state exhibits a higher degree of symmetry breaking. The effect has
been recently discovered theoretically and observed experimentally in the
framework of global quantum quenches, but so far it has only been investigated
in one-dimensional systems. Here we focus on a two-dimensional free-fermion
lattice employing the entanglement asymmetry as a measure of symmetry breaking.
Our investigation begins with the ground state analysis of a system featuring
nearest-neighbor hoppings and superconducting pairings, the latter breaking
explicitly the $U(1)$ particle number symmetry. We compute analytically the
entanglement asymmetry of a periodic strip using dimensional reduction, an
approach that allows us to adjust the extent of the transverse size, achieving
a smooth crossover between one and two dimensions. Further applying the same
method, we study the time evolution of the entanglement asymmetry after a
quench to a Hamiltonian with only nearest-neighbor hoppings, preserving the
particle number symmetry which is restored in the stationary state. We find
that the quantum Mpemba effect is strongly affected by the size of the system
in the transverse dimension, with the potential to either enhance or spoil the
phenomenon depending on the initial states. We establish the conditions for its
occurrence based on the properties of the initial configurations, extending the
criteria found in the one-dimensional case.

<h3>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped  limit of homogeneous rotational Brownian motion</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Arthur V. Straube, Felix Höfling</i>
<p>The translational motion of anisotropic and self-propelled colloidal
particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational
Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the
orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is
characterised by an orientation-dependent ("multiplicative") noise. As a
consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms
depending on whether It\=o's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We
clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them from a geometric
construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal
random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme
for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalisation constraint of
the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the
scheme converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline
an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large
time step. The discussion is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian
motion (i.e., constant rotational diffusion tensor), which is relevant for
chemically anisotropic spheres such as self-propelled Janus particles.

<p>Nonlinear transport is a unique functionality of noncentrosymmetric systems,
which reflects profound physics, such as spin-orbit interaction,
superconductivity and band geometry. However, it remains highly challenging to
enhance the nonreciprocal transport for promising rectification devices. Here,
we observe a light-induced giant enhancement of nonreciprocal transport at the
superconducting and epitaxial CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interfaces. The nonreciprocal
transport coefficient undergoes a giant increase with three orders of magnitude
up to 105 A-1T-1. Furthermore, a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling effective
field of 14.7 T is achieved with abundant high-mobility photocarriers under
ultraviolet illumination, which accounts for the giant enhancement of
nonreciprocal transport coefficient. Our first-principles calculations further
disclose the stronger Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength and the longer
relaxation time in the photocarrier excitation process, bridging the
light-property quantitative relationship. Our work provides an alternative
pathway to boost nonreciprocal transport in noncentrosymmetric systems and
facilitates the promising applications in opto-rectification devices and
spin-orbitronic devices.

<p>We rigorously prove that the Heisenberg chain with next-nearest-neighbor
interaction, which is anticipated to be non-integrable, is indeed
non-integrable in the sense that this system has no nontrivial local conserved
quantity. Our result covers two important models, the Majundhar-Ghosh model and
the Shastry-Sutherland model, as special cases. These models are shown to be
non-integrable while have some solvable energy eigenstates.

<h3>Anisotropic Hall effects in Bi$_2$Se$_3$/EuS interfaces</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Juhi Singh, Karthik V. Raman, Narayan Mohanta</i>
<p>Proximity coupling of ferromagnetic insulator EuS to the topological
insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has been proposed to break time-reversal symmetry near
the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, introducing an energy gap or a tilt in the surface
Dirac cone. As an inverse proximity effect, strong spin-orbit coupling
available in the topological surface states can enhance the Curie temperature
of ferromagnetism in EuS largely beyond its bulk value, and also generate a
magnetic anisotropy. This can result in a canting of the magnetic moment of Eu
ions in a plane perpendicular to the interface. Here, we investigate
theoretically electronic transport properties arising from the Bi$_2$Se$_3$/EuS
interfaces in the planar Hall geometry. Our analysis, based on a realistic
model Hamiltonian and a semi-classical formalism for the Boltzmann transport
equation, reveals distinct intriguing features of anisotropic planar Hall
conductivity, depending on different scenarios for the canting of the Eu
moments: fixed Eu moment canting, and freely-orientable Eu moment in response
to the external in-plane magnetic field. The anisotropy in the planar Hall
conductivity arises from the asymmetric Berry curvature of the gapped
topological surface states. We also explore topological Hall effect of the
Dirac surface states, coupled to a skyrmion crystal which can emerge in the EuS
due to the interplay of ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and perpendicular alignment of the Eu
moment. Our study provides new impetus for probing complex interplay between
magnetic exchange interactions and topological surface states via anisotropic
planar Hall effects.

<h3>Chirped pulse control over the melting of superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04538</a>
<br>

<p>Strong field terahertz pulses are increasingly used to excite and control
quantum materials at the ultrafast timescale. They have found widespread
application by enabling direct addressing of the superconducting gap or
Josephson resonances and are essential in Higgs spectroscopy. Large non-linear
optical signals can be induced by the strong coupling of the THz and
superconducting degrees of freedom. However, far less attention has been paid
to the strong bi-directional coupling between field and material this implies.
Here, we use the framework of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations to
study the full field and material evolution of a superconductor driven by
strong field terahertz pulses. We find that at high field strengths, the
backreaction of the superconductor induces large changes to the driving pulse,
which in turn leads to a runaway melting of the superconducting condensate.
This results in a surprisingly large sensitivity to the initial driving pulse
chirp, enabling these purely dynamical changes to result in order of magnitude
different levels of melting. We also find large-scale spectral shifting of the
driving pulse to occur in just a few hundred nanometers of propagation through
a superconductor. We attribute these effects to an inverse plasma redshift, in
which the driving field breaks Cooper pairs and decreases the free-electron
mobility, analogous to reducing the density of a plasma.

<h3>Impact of bright-dark exciton thermal population mixing on the  brightness of CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals</h3>

</p><i>Mohamed-Raouf Amara, Caixia Huo, Christophe Voisin, Qihua Xiong, Carole Diederichs</i>
<p>Understanding the interplay between bright and dark exciton states is crucial
for deciphering the luminescence properties of low-dimensional materials. The
origin of the outstanding brightness of lead halide perovskites remains
elusive. Here, we analyse temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence
to investigate the population mixing between bright and dark exciton sublevels
in individual CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in the intermediate confinement regime. We
extract bright and dark exciton decay rates, and show quantitatively that the
decay dynamics can only be reproduced with second-order phonon transitions.
Furthermore, we find that any exciton sublevel ordering is compatible with the
most likely population transfer mechanism. The remarkable brightness of lead
halide perovskite nanocrystals rather stems from a reduced asymmetry between
bright-to-dark and dark-to-bright conversion originating from the peculiar
second-order phonon-assisted transitions that freeze bright-dark conversion at
low temperature together with the very fast radiative recombination and
favourable degeneracy of the bright exciton state.

<p>We present local and nonlocal electrical transport measurements of the
correlated insulator FeSb$_2$. By employing wiring configurations that
delineate between bulk- and surface-dominated conduction, we reveal the
formation of a metallic surface state in FeSb$_2$ for temperatures $\lessapprox
5$~K. This result is corroborated by an angular rotation study of this
material's magnetotransport, which also shows signatures of the transition from
bulk- to surface-dominated conduction over the same temperature interval as the
local/nonlocal transport divergence. Notable similarities with the topological
Kondo insulator candidate SmB$_6$ are discussed.

<p>Nonlinear photoluminescence (N-PL) is a broadband photon emission arising
from non-equilibrium electron distribution generated at the surface of metallic
nanostructures by an ultrafast pulsed laser illumination. N-PL is sensitive to
surface morphology, local electromagnetic field strength, and electronic band
structure making it relevant to probe optically excited nanoscale plasmonic
systems. It also has been key to access the complex multiscale time dynamics
ruling electron thermalization. Here, we show that the surface plasmons
mediated N-PL emitted by a gold nanowire can be modified by an electrical
architecture featuring a nanogap. Upon voltage activation, we observe that N-PL
becomes dependent to the electrical transport dynamics and can thus be locally
modulated. This finding brings an electrical leverage to externally control the
photoluminescence generated from metal nanostructures, and constitutes an asset
for the development of emerging nanoscale interface devices managing photons
and electrons.

<p>Germanium arsenide (GeAs) is a layered semiconductor with remarkably
anisotropic physical, thermoelectric and optical properties, and a promising
candidate for multifunctional devices based on in-plane polarization dependent
response. Understanding the underlying mechanism of such devices requires the
knowledge of GeAs electronic band structure and of the hot carrier dynamics in
its conduction band, whose details are still unclear. In this work, we
investigated the properties of occupied and photoexcited states of GeAs in
energy-momentum space, by combining scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS),
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and time-resolved ARPES. We
found that, GeAs is an indirect gap semiconductor having an electronic gap of
0.8 eV, for which the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the Gamma
point while the valence band maximum (VBM) is out of Gamma. A Stark broadening
of the valence band is observed immediately after photoexcitation, which can be
attributed to the effects of the electrical field at the surface induced by
inhomogeneous screening. Moreover, the hot electrons relaxation time of 1.56 ps
down to the CBM which is dominated from both inter-valley and intra-valley
coupling. Besides their relevance for our understanding of GeAs, these findings
present general interest for the design on high performance thermoelectric and
optoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductors.

<h3>Topological Phase Transitions of Interacting Fermions in the Presence of  a Commensurate Magnetic Flux</h3>

</p><i>Axel Fünfhaus, Marius Möller, Thilo Kopp, Roser Valentí</i>
<p>Motivated by recently reported magnetic-field induced topological phases in
ultracold atoms and correlated Moir\'e materials, we investigate topological
phase transitions in a minimal model consisting of interacting spinless
fermions described by the Hofstadter model on a square lattice. For interacting
lattice Hamiltonians in the presence of a commensurate magnetic flux it has
been demonstrated that the quantized Hall conductivity is constrained by a
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM)-type theorem due to magnetic translation symmetry. In
this work, we revisit the validity of the theorem for such models and establish
that a topological phase transition from a topological to a trivial insulating
phase can be realized but must be accompanied by spontaneous magnetic
translation symmetry breaking caused by charge ordering of the spinless
fermions. To support our findings, the topological phase diagram for varying
interaction strength is mapped out numerically with exact diagonalization for
different flux quantum ratios and band fillings using symmetry indicators. We
discuss our results in the context of the LSM-type theorem.

<h3>Bloch oscillations in a transmon embedded in a resonant electromagnetic  environment</h3>

<p>Recently developed Josephson junction array transmission lines implement
strong-coupling circuit electrodynamics compatible with a range of
superconducting quantum devices. They provide both the high impedance which
allows for strong quantum fluctuations, and photon modes with which to probe a
quantum device, such as a small Josephson junction. In this high-impedance
environment, current through the junction is accompanied by charge Bloch
oscillations analogous to those in crystalline systems. However, the interplay
between Bloch oscillations and environmental photon resonances remains largely
unexplored. Here we describe the Bloch oscillations in a transmon-type qubit
attached to high-impedance transmission lines with discrete photon spectra.
Transmons are characterized by well-separated charge bands, favoring Bloch
oscillations over Landau-Zener tunneling. We find resonances in the
voltage--current relation and the spectrum of photons emitted by the Bloch
oscillations. The transmon also scatters photons inelastically; we find the
cross-section for a novel anti-Stokes-like process whereby photons gain a Bloch
oscillation quantum. Our results outline how Bloch oscillations leave
fingerprints for experiments across the DC, MHz, and GHz ranges.

<br>
</p><i>Vladislav D. Kurilovich, Benjamin Remez, Leonid I. Glazman</i>
<p>A transmon qubit embedded in a high-impedance environment acts in a way dual
to a conventional Josephson junction. In analogy to the AC Josephson effect,
biasing of the transmon by a direct current leads to the oscillations of
voltage across it. These oscillations are known as the Bloch oscillations. We
find the Bloch oscillations spectrum, and show that the zero-point fluctuations
of charge make it broad-band. Despite having a broad-band spectrum, Bloch
oscillations can be brought in resonance with an external microwave radiation.
The resonances lead to steps in the voltage-current relation, which are dual to
the conventional Shapiro steps. We find how the shape of the steps depends on
the environment impedance $R$, parameters of the transmon, and the microwave
amplitude. The Bloch oscillations rely on the insulating state of the transmon
which is realized at impedances exceeding the Schmid transition point, $R > R_Q
= h / (2e)^2$.

<p>The interplay of band topology and electron interactions can lead to novel
quantum states of matter. In this work, we theoretically study the quantum spin
Hall insulator (QSHI) in a perpendicular magnetic field. In the noninteracting
case, the QSHI with space inversion and uniaxial spin rotation symmetries
undergoes a topological transition into a normal insulator phase at a critical
magnetic field $B_{\mathrm{c}}$. The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau
levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\mathrm{c}}$
and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We
propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy can directly probe the
exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to the InAs/GaSb quantum
wells and other QSHIs.

<p>The quantum regression theorem states that the correlations of a system at
two different times are governed by the same equations of motion as the
temporal response of the average values. Such a relation provides a powerful
framework for the investigation of physical systems by establishing a formal
connection between intrinsic microscopic behaviour and a macroscopic 'effect'
due to an external 'cause'. Measuring the response to a controlled perturbation
in this way allows to determine, for example, structure factors in condensed
matter systems as well as other correlation functions of material systems. Here
we experimentally demonstrate that the two-time particle number correlations in
a photon Bose-Einstein condensate inside a dye-filled microcavity exhibit the
same dynamics as the response of the condensate to a sudden perturbation of the
dye molecule bath. This confirms the regression theorem for a quantum gas and,
moreover, establishes a test of this relation in an unconventional form where
the perturbation acts on the bath and only the condensate response is
monitored. For strong perturbations, we observe nonlinear relaxation dynamics
which our microscopic theory relates to the equilibrium fluctuations, thereby
extending the regression theorem beyond the regime of linear response. The
demonstrated nonlinearity of the condensate-bath system paves the way for
studies of novel elementary excitations in lattices of driven-dissipative
photon condensates.

<p>Biological and living organisms sense and process information from their
surroundings, typically having access only to a subset of external observables
for a limited amount of time. In this work, we uncover how biological systems
can exploit these accessible degrees of freedom (DOFs) to transduce information
from the inaccessible ones with a limited energy budget. We find that optimal
transduction strategies may boost information harvesting over the ideal case in
which all DOFs are known, even when only finite-time trajectories are observed,
at the price of higher dissipation. We apply our results to red blood cells,
inferring the implemented transduction strategy from membrane flickering data
and shedding light on the connection between mechanical stress and transduction
efficiency. Our framework offers novel insights into the adaptive strategies of
biological systems under non-equilibrium conditions.

<br>
</p><i>Thibault Bourgeois, Lauriane Chomaz</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the impact of weak perturbations of a flat
potential on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas. We use a
mean-field perturbative treatment of the potential defects and derive their
effects at first order in the mean-field stable regime. We first focus on
defects containing a single spatial frequency and study the wavevector
dependence of the density perturbation. A qualitative modification of the
wavenumber dependence with the interaction parameters and a sensitivity in the
excitation direction reveal the long-range and anisotropic dipolar effects.
These effects are found to be most important at intermediate wavenumbers and
can give rise to a local maximum in the density perturbation reminiscent of the
roton mode softening and local instabilities. The dependence on the gas and
interaction parameters is studied. The case of a flat potential perturbed with
white noise on a certain momentum range is then examined. Here it is found that
the strength perturbation becomes independent of the mean density when
sufficiently large. Our study touches upon experimentally relevant issues,
giving hints on how flat a uniform potential should be to achieve uniform
quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gases.

<h3>Effects of mechanical stress, chemical potential, and coverage on  hydrogen solubility during hydrogen enhanced decohesion of ferritic steel  grain boundaries: A first-principles study</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Abril Azocar Guzman, Rebecca Janisch</i>
<p>Hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) is one of the many mechanisms of hydrogen
embrittlement, a phenomenon which severely impacts structural materials such as
iron and iron alloys. Grain boundaries (GBs) play a critical role in this
mechanism, where they can provide trapping sites or act as hydrogen diffusion
pathways. The interaction of H with GBs and other crystallographic defects, and
thus the solubility and distribution of H in the microstructure, depends on the
concentration, chemical potential and local stress. Therefore, for a
quantitative assessment of HEDE, a generalized solution energy in conjunction
with the cohesive strength as a function of hydrogen coverage is needed. In
this work, we carry out density functional theory calculations to investigate
the influence of H on the decohesion of the $\Sigma$5(310)[001] and
$\Sigma$3(112)[1$\bar{1}$0] symmetrical tilt GBs in bcc Fe, as examples for
open and close-packed GB structures. A method to identify the segregation sites
at the GB plane is proposed. The results indicate that at higher local
concentrations, H leads to a significant reduction of the cohesive strength of
the GB planes, significantly more pronounced at the $\Sigma$5 than at the
$\Sigma$3 GB. Interestingly, at finite stress the $\Sigma$3 GB becomes more
favorable for H solution, as opposed to the case of zero stress, where the
$\Sigma$5 GB is more attractive. This suggests that under certain conditions
stresses in the microstructure can lead to a re-distribution of H to the
stronger grain boundary, which opens a new path to designing H-resistant
microstructures. To round up our study, we investigate the effects of typical
alloying elements in ferritic steel, C, V, Cr and Mn, on the solubility of H
and the strength of the GBs.
