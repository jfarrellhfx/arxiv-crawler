<h3>Limits to Fluctuation Dynamics</h3>

The fluctuation of an experimentally measured observable, along with its
mean, constitutes the fundamental ingredient of a non-equilibrium system
involving randomness. Despite previous efforts, a comprehensive framework for
characterizing the temporal dynamics of fluctuations of observables remains
elusive. In this manuscript, we develop a ubiquitous theory concerning rigorous
limits to the rate of fluctuation growth. We discover a simple principle that
the time derivative of the standard deviation of an observable is upper bound
by the standard deviation of an appropriate observable describing velocity.
This indicates a hitherto unknown tradeoff relation between the changes for the
mean and standard deviation, i.e., the sum of the squares for these quantities
cannot exceed certain cost determined by dynamical processes. The cost can be
kinetic energy for hydrodynamics, irreversible entropy production rate for
thermodynamic processes, energy fluctuations for unitary quantum dynamics, and
quantum Fisher information for dissipative quantum dynamics. Our results open
an avenue toward a quantitative theory of fluctuation dynamics in various
non-equilibrium systems, encompassing quantum many-body systems and nonlinear
population dynamics, as well as toward our understanding of how to control
them.

<h3>Topological superconductivity mediated by magnons of helical magnetic  states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07211</a>
<br>
<i>Kristian Mæland, Sara Abnar, Jacob Benestad, Asle Sudbø</i>

<br>
We recently showed that spin fluctuations of noncoplanar magnetic states can
induce topological superconductivity in an adjacent normal metal [K. M{\ae}land
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 156002 (2023)]. The noncolinear nature of the
spins was found to be essential for this result, while the necessity of
noncoplanar spins was unclear. In this paper we show that magnons in coplanar,
noncolinear magnetic states can mediate topological superconductivity in a
normal metal. Two models of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are studied
to illustrate the need for a sufficiently complicated Hamiltonian describing
the magnetic insulator. The Hamiltonian, in particular the specific form of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, affects the magnons and by extension the
effective electron-electron interaction in the normal metal. We solve a
linearized gap equation in the case of weak-coupling superconductivity. The
result is a time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductor, as confirmed by
calculating the topological invariant. In analogy with magnon-mediated
superconductivity from antiferromagnets, Umklapp scattering enhances the
critical temperature of superconductivity for certain Fermi momenta.

<h3>Spin-valley entangled quantum Hall states in graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07217</a>
<br>
<i>Nikolaos Stefanidis, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate interaction-driven integer quantum Hall states realized in
Landau levels of monolayer graphene when two out of its four nearly degenerate
spin-valley flavors are filled. By employing a model that accounts for
interactions beyond pure delta-functions as well as Zeeman and
substrate-induced valley potentials, we demonstrate the existence of a delicate
competition of several phases with spontaneous generation of spin-valley
entanglement, akin to the spontaneous appearance of spin-orbit coupling driven
by interactions. We encounter a particular phase that we term the
entangled-Kekul\'{e}-antiferromagnet (E-KD-AF) which only becomes spin-valley
entangled under the simultaneous presence of Zeeman and substrate potentials,
because it gains energy by simultaneously canting in the spin and valley
spaces, by combining features of a canted anti-ferromagnet and a canted
Kekul\'{e} state. We quantify the degree of spin-valley entanglement of the
many competing phases by computing their bipartite concurrence.

<h3>Time-Reversal Invariant Topological Moiré Flatband: A Platform for the  Fractional Quantum Spin Hall Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07222" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07222</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ming Wu, Daniel Shaffer, Zhengzhi Wu, Luiz H. Santos</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experimental observation of the quantum spin Hall effect
in monolayer germanene, we study the topological phases of twisted bilayer
Kane-Mele model with time-reversal symmetry and spin $s_z$ conservation. For
large twist angles the helical edge states from the two layers are unstable and
the system is a trivial insulator. At small twist angles however, the emergent
moir\'e flatbands can be topologically nontrivial due to inversion symmetry
breaking from coupling to substrate. Each of these flatbands for each spin
projection admits a lowest-Landau-level description in the chiral limit and at
magic twist angle. This allows for the construction of a many-body Laughlin
state with time-reversal symmetry which can be stabilized by a short-range
pseudopotential, and therefore serves as an ideal platform for realizing the
so-far elusive fractional quantum spin Hall effect with emergent spin-1/2 U(1)
symmetry.

<h3>Decoding transverse spin dynamics by energy-resolved correlation  measurement</h3>

<br>
<i>J. Huang, J. E. Thomas</i>
<br>
<br>
We study transverse spin dynamics on a microscopic level by measuring
energy-resolved spin correlations in a weakly-interacting Fermi gas. The
trapped cloud behaves as a many-body spin-lattice in energy space with
effective long-range interactions, simulating a collective Heisenberg model. We
observe the flow of correlations in energy space in this quasi-continuous
system, revealing the connection between the evolution of the magnetization and
the localization or spread of correlations. This work highlights energy-space
correlation as a new observable in quantum phase transition studies, decoding
system features that are hidden in macroscopic measurements.

<h3>Optimally Localized Wannier Functions for 2D Chern Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07242</a>
<br>
<i>Thivan M. Gunawardana, Ari M. Turner, Ryan Barnett</i>
<br>
<br>
The construction of optimally localized Wannier functions (and Wannier
functions in general) for a Chern insulator has been considered to be
impossible owing to the fact that the second moment of such functions is
generally infinite. In this manuscript, we propose a solution to this problem
in the case of a single band. We accomplish this by drawing an analogy between
the minimization of the variance and the minimization of the electrostatic
energy of a periodic array of point charges in a smooth neutralizing
background. In doing so, we obtain a natural regularization of the diverging
variance and this leads to an analytical solution to the minimization problem.
We demonstrate our results numerically for a particular model system.
Furthermore, we show how the optimally localized Wannier functions provide a
natural way of evaluating the electric polarization for a Chern insulator.

<h3>Nonlinear breathers with crystalline symmetries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07244" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07244</a>
<br>
<i>Frank Schindler, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wladimir A. Benalcazar</i>
<br>
<br>
Nonlinear lattice models can support "discrete breather" excitations that
stay localized in space for all time. By contrast, the localized Wannier states
of linear lattice models are dynamically unstable. Nevertheless, symmetric and
exponentially localized Wannier states are a central tool in the classification
of band structures with crystalline symmetries. Moreover, the quantized
transport observed in nonlinear Thouless pumps relies on the fact that -- at
least in a specific model -- discrete breathers recover Wannier states in the
limit of vanishing nonlinearity. Motivated by these observations, we
investigate the correspondence between nonlinear breathers and linear Wannier
states for a family of discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with
crystalline symmetries. We develop a formalism to analytically predict the
breathers' spectrum, center of mass and symmetry representations, and apply
this to nonlinear generalizations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and the
breathing kagome lattice.

<h3>Self-duality properties and localization centers of the electronic wave  functions at high magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07260</a>
<br>
<i>Leonardo A. Navarro-Labastida, Gerardo G. Naumis</i>
<br>
<br>
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known for exhibiting highly correlated
phases at magic angles due to the emergence of flat bands that enhance
electron-electron interactions. In the TBG chiral model, electronic wave
function properties depend on a single parameter ($\alpha$), inversely
proportional to the relative twist angle between the two graphene layers. In
previous studies, as the twist angles approached small values, strong
confinement, and convergence to coherent Landau states were observed. This work
explores flat-band electronic modes, revealing that flat band states exhibit
self-duality; they are coherent Landau states in reciprocal space and exhibit
minimal dispersion, with standard deviation $\sigma_k=\sqrt{3\alpha/2\pi}$ as
$\alpha$ approaches infinity. Subsequently, by symmetrizing the wave functions
and considering the squared TBG Hamiltonian, the strong confinement observed in
the $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$ limit is explained. This confinement arises from
the combination of the symmetrized squared norm of the moir\'e potential and
the quantized orbital motion of electrons, effectively creating a quantum well.
The ground state of this well, located at defined spots, corresponds to Landau
levels with energy determined by the magic angle. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the problem is physically analogous to an electron attached to a
non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field with an underlying $C_3$ symmetry. In regions
of strong confinement, the system can be considered as Abelian. This allows to
define a magnetic energy in which the important role of the wave function
parity and gap closing at non-magic angles is revealed. Finally, we investigate
the transition from the original non-Abelian nature to an Abelian state by
artificially changing the pseudo-magnetic vector components from an $SU(2)$ to
a $U(1)$ field, which alters the sequence of magic angles.

<h3>Topological protection of Majorana polaritons in a cavity</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cavity embedding is an emerging paradigm for the control of quantum matter,
offering avenues to manipulate electronic states and potentially drive
topological phase transitions. In this work, we address the stability of a
one-dimensional topological superconducting phase to the vacuum quantum
fluctuations brought by a global cavity mode. By employing a quasi-adiabatic
analytical approach completed by density matrix renormalization group
calculations, we show that the Majorana end modes evolve into composite
polaritonic modes while maintaining the topological order intact and robust to
disorder. These Majorana polaritons keep their non-abelian exchange properties
and protect a twofold exponentially degenerate ground state for an open chain.

<h3>The 'Garber Current Pattern': An Additional Contribution to AC Losses in  Helical HTS Cables?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07292" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07292</a>

Conductors made of high-temperature (HTS) wires helically wound in one or
more layers on round tubes (CORT) are compact, flexible, and can carry a large
amount of current. Although these conductors were initially developed for DC
applications, e.g. in magnets, it is worth considering their use for AC, e.g.
in underground cables for medium voltage grids and with currents in the
kA-range. In these cases, the major challenge is reducing AC losses. In
contrast to a straight superconducting wire, in a helical arrangement, due to
superconducting shielding, the current does not follow the direction of the
wires, but takes a non-trivial zig-zag path within the individual HTS wires
(Garber pattern). This includes current components across the thickness of the
superconducting layers, so that the often used thin-shell approximation does
not hold. In this contribution, we studied a one-layer three-wire CORT by means
of fully three-dimensional simulations, based on the H-formulation of Maxwell's
equations implemented in the commercial software package COMSOL Multiphysics.
As a result of our simulations, the peculiar current profiles were confirmed.
In addition, the influence of current, pitch angle, and frequency on the AC
losses was studied. We found an optimum for the pitch angle and that the
current profiles strongly depend on frequency.

<h3>A mechanically-derived contact model for adhesive elastic-perfectly  plastic particles. Part I: Utilizing the method of dimensionality reduction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07300</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In this two part series, we present a contact model able to capture the
response of interacting adhesive elastic-perfectly plastic particles under a
variety of loadings. In Part I, we focus on elastic through fully-plastic
contact with and without adhesion. For these contact regimes the model is built
upon the method of dimensionality reduction which allows the problem of a 3D
axisymmetric contact to be mapped to a semi-equivalent problem of a 1D rigid
indenter penetrating a bed of independent Hookean springs. Plasticity is
accounted for by continuously varying the 1D indenter profile subject to a
constraint on the contact pressure. Unloading falls out naturally, and simply
requires lifting the 1D indenter out of the springs and tracking the force. By
accounting for the incompressible nature of this plastic deformation, the
contact model is able to capture multi-neighbor dependent effects such as
increased force and formation of new contacts. JKR type adhesion is recovered
seamlessly within the method of dimensionality reduction by simply allowing the
springs to stick to the 1D indenter's surface. Because of the mechanics-focused
formulation of the contact model, only a few physical inputs describing the
interacting particles are needed: particle radius, Young's modulus, Poisson
ratio, yield stress, and effective surface energy. The contact model is
validated against finite element simulations and analytic theory, including
Hertz's contact law and the JKR theory of adhesion. These comparisons show that
the proposed contact model is able to accurately capture plastic displacement,
average contact pressure, contact area, and force as a function of displacement
for contacts as well as particle volume within the elastic to fully-plastic
regimes.

<h3>A mechanically-derived contact model for adhesive elastic-perfectly  plastic particles. Part II: Contact under high compaction--adding a bulk  elastic response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07317</a>
<br>
<i>William Zunker, Ken Kamrin</i>
<br>
<br>
In Part I of this two part series, we presented a multi-neighbor dependent
contact model for adhesive elastic-plastic particles built upon the method of
dimensionality reduction that is valid for the elastic and fully-plastic
contact regimes. In this Part II, we complete the contact model by proposing a
treatment for the bulk elastic contact regime which is characterized by a rapid
stiffening in the force-displacement curve as interstitial pore spaces vanish.
A simple formulation is presented for an additional bulk elastic force. A novel
criterion for triggering this force (i.e. detecting the bulk elastic regime)
related to the remaining free surface area of the particle is also given. This
bulk elastic force is then superimposed with the force response given in Part I
to achieve a contact model capable of capturing a variety of complex loadings.
In this way, the methodology for treating the bulk elastic regime presented
here stands independent of Part I and could be appended to any contact model.
Direct comparison is made to finite element simulations showcasing bulk elastic
responses, revealing the accurate predictive capabilities of the contact model.
Notably, the contact model is also demonstrated to detect and evolve contacts
caused purely by outward displacement of the free surface with good precision.

<h3>Bicrystallography-informed Frenkel-Kontorova model for interlayer  dislocations in strained 2D heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07325</a>

<br>
<br>
In recent years, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and homostructures,
which consist of stacks of two-dimensional (2D) materials, have risen to
prominence due to their association with exotic quantum phenomena. Atomistic
scale relaxation effects play an extremely important role in the electronic
scale quantum physics of these systems. We investigate such structural
relaxation effects in this work using atomistic and mesoscale models, within
the context of twisted bilayer graphene -- a well-known heterostructure system
that features moire patterns arising from the lattices of the two graphene
layers. For small twist angles, atomic relaxation effects in this system are
associated with the natural emergence of interface dislocations or strain
solitons, which result from the cyclic nature of the generalized stacking fault
energy (GSFE), that measures the interface energy based on the relative
movement of the two layers. In this work, we first demonstrate using atomistic
simulations that atomic reconstruction in bilayer graphene under a large twist
also results from interface dislocations, although the Burgers vectors of such
dislocations are considerably smaller than those observed in small-twist
systems. To reveal the translational invariance of the heterointerface
responsible for the formation of such dislocations, we derive the translational
symmetry of the GSFE of a 2D heterostructure using the notions of coincident
site lattices (CSLs) and displacement shift complete lattices (DSCLs). The
workhorse for this exercise is a recently developed Smith normal form
bicrystallography framework. Next, we construct a bicrystallography-informed
and frame-invariant Frenkel-Kontorova model, which can predict the formation of
strain solitons in arbitrary 2D heterostructures, and apply it to study a
heterostrained, large-twist bilayer graphene system.

Topological insulators have remained as candidates for future electronic
devices since their first experimental realization in the past decade. The
existence of topologically protected edge states could be exploited to generate
a robust platform and develop quantum computers. In this work we explore the
role of magnetic impurities in the transport properties of topological
insulators, in particular, we study the effect on the edge states conductivity.
By means of realistic $\it{ab}$ $\it{initio}$ calculations we simulate the
interaction between magnetic adatoms and topological insulators, furthermore,
our main goal is to obtain the transport properties for large samples as it
would be possible to localize edge states at large scales.

Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are a promising platform for nanoscale
nuclear magnetic resonance sensing. Despite significant progress towards using
NV centers to detect and localize nuclear spins down to the single spin level,
NV-based spectroscopy of individual, intact, arbitrary target molecules remains
elusive. NV molecular sensing requires that target molecules are immobilized
within a few nanometers of NV centers with long spin coherence time. The inert
nature of diamond typically requires harsh functionalization techniques such as
thermal annealing or plasma processing, limiting the scope of functional groups
that can be attached to the surface. Solution-phase chemical methods can be
more readily generalized to install diverse functional groups, but they have
not been widely explored for single-crystal diamond surfaces. Moreover,
realizing shallow NV centers with long spin coherence times requires highly
ordered single-crystal surfaces, and solution-phase functionalization has not
yet been shown to be compatible with such demanding conditions. In this work,
we report a versatile strategy to directly functionalize C-H bonds on
single-crystal diamond surfaces under ambient conditions using visible light.
This functionalization method is compatible with charge stable NV centers
within 10 nm of the surface with spin coherence times comparable to the state
of the art. As a proof of principle, we use shallow ensembles of NV centers to
detect nuclear spins from functional groups attached to the surface. Our
approach to surface functionalization based on visible light-driven C-H bond
activation opens the door to deploying NV centers as a broad tool for chemical
sensing and single-molecule spectroscopy.

Deep neural networks have shown many fruitful applications in this decade. A
network can get the generalized function through training with a finite
dataset. The degree of generalization is a realization of the proximity scale
in the data space. Specifically, the scale is not clear if the dataset is
complicated. Here we consider a network for the distribution estimation of the
dataset. We show the estimation is unstable and the instability depends on the
data density and training duration. We derive the kernel-balanced equation,
which gives a short phenomenological description of the solution. The equation
tells us the reason for the instability and the mechanism of the scale. The
network outputs a local average of the dataset as a prediction and the scale of
averaging is determined along the equation. The scale gradually decreases along
training and finally results in instability in our case.

Shortwave infrared (SWIR) has various applications, including night vision,
remote sensing, and medical imaging. SWIR organic photodetectors (OPDs) offer
advantages such as flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and tunable properties,
however, lower sensitivity and limited spectral coverage compared to inorganic
counterparts are major drawbacks. Here, we propose a simple yet effective and
widely applicable strategy to extend the wavelength detection range of OPD to a
longer wavelength, using resonant optical microcavity. We demonstrate a
proof-of-concept in PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F blend system, achieving external quantum
efficiency (EQE) > 50 % over a broad spectrum 450 - 1100 nm with a peak
specific detectivity (D*) of 1.1E13 Jones at 1100 nm, while cut-off bandwidth,
speed, and linearity are preserved. By employing a novel small-molecule
acceptor IR6, a record high EQE = 35 % and D* = 4.1E12 Jones are obtained at
1150 nm. This research emphasizes the importance of optical design in
optoelectronic devices, presenting a considerably simpler method to expand the
photodetection range compared to a traditional approach that involves
developing absorbers with narrow optical gaps.

<h3>Composition and Structure Based GGA Bandgap Prediction Using Machine  Learning Approach</h3>

This study focuses on developing precise machine learning (ML) regression
models for predicting energy bandgap values based on chemical compositions and
crystal structures. The primary aim is to match the accuracy of predictions
derived from GGA-PBE calculations and validate them through density functional
theory (DFT)-based band structure calculations. We assessed eight standalone ML
regression models, including AdaBoost, Bagging, CatBoost, LGBM, RF, DT, GB, and
XGB. These models were analyzed for their ability to predict GGA-PBE bandgap
values across diverse material structures and compositions, using a dataset
containing bandgap values for 106,113 compounds. Additionally, we constructed
four ensemble models using the stacking method and seven using the bagging
method. These ensemble models incorporated RidgeCV and LassoCV to explore if
ensemble techniques could enhance prediction accuracy. The dataset was divided
into subsets of varying sizes: 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 entries. We
determined feature importance through permutation techniques and established a
correlation coefficient matrix using the Pearson correlation method. The Random
Forest (RF) model emerged as the top performer among standalone models,
achieving an R2 value of 0.943 and an RMSE value of 0.504 eV. Bagging
regression demonstrated improved performance across different dataset sizes
with streamlined feature selection. Ensemble models, particularly bagging,
consistently outperformed standalone models, achieving the best R2 value of
0.948 and an RMSE value of 0.479 eV in the test dataset. Using the
best-performing model, we predicted bandgap values for new half-Heusler
compounds with 18 valence electron counts. These predictions were successfully
validated using accurate DFT calculations. DFT calculations indicated that the
newly predicted compounds are narrow bandgap semiconductors with dynamic
stability.

<h3>Momentum-Dependent Local Ansatz Approach to the Quasiparticle States</h3>

Momentum-dependent local ansatz (MLA) wavefunction approach to correlated
electrons in solids has been extended to the quasiparticle excited states on
the basis of the Fermi liquid picture. The quasiparticle energy is derived from
the MLA-base excited state wavefunction within the single-site approximation.
The quasiparticle weight and quasiparticle energy have been calculated for the
Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice in infinite dimensions as well as the
simple cubic lattice. By comparing the numerical results with the
single-particle excitation spectra obtained by the Green function method, it is
shown that the MLA excited wavefunctions describe well the quasiparticle states
in the weak and intermediate Coulomb interaction regime in the high dimensional
system.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate phase control of magnons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet
NiPS$_3$ using optical excitation by polarized light. The sign of the coherent
precession of spin amplitude changes upon (1) reversing the helicity of a
circularly polarized pump beam, or (2) rotating the polarization of a linearly
polarized pump by $\pi/2$. Because these two excitation pathways have
comparable generation efficiency, the phase of spin precession can be
continuously tuned from 0 to $2\pi$ by controlling the polarization state of
the pump pulse. The ability to excite magnons with a desired phase has
potential applications in the design of a spin-wave phased array and ultrafast
spin information processing.

Circular Dyson Brownian motion describes the equilibrium and non-equilibrium
level dynamics of unitary ("circular") matrices within the log-gas picture of
random matrix theory. A common scenario is that one wants to know about a
spectrum evolved over a certain interval of time, without being interested in
the intermediate dynamics. Numerical evaluation of this is computationally
expensive as the time-evolution algorithm is accurate only on short time
intervals because of an underlying perturbative approximation, leading to the
need of extensively many intermediate evaluations. This work proposes an
efficient and easy-to-implement improved circular Dyson Brownian motion
algorithm for models with broken time-reversal symmetry. This algorithm can be
seen as a generalization of a commonly used algorithm generating samples from
the circular unitary ensemble. The algorithm allows one to study time-evolution
over arbitrarily large intervals of time at a fixed computational cost, with no
approximations being involved.

Solubility and interfacial energy are two fundamental parameters underlying
the competitive nucleation of polymorphs. However, solubility measurement of
metastable phases comes with a risk of solventmediated transformations which
can render the results unreliable. In this work, we present a rapid
microfluidic technique for measuring aqueous solubility of the metastable form
using KDP Phase IV as a model system. This bracketing approach involves
analyzing the dissolution behavior of crystals in contact with supersaturated
microdroplets generated via evaporation. Then, with the help of our recently
developed nucleation time measurement technique, together with Mersmann
calculation of interfacial energies from solubilities, we were able to access
the interfacial energies of both metastable and stable phases. To gain further
insights into the observed nucleation behavior, we employed the Classical
Nucleation Theory (CNT) to model the competition of polymorphs using our
measured solubility and calculated interfacial energies. The results show that
the stable form is favored at lower supersaturation while the metastable form
is favored at higher supersaturation, in good agreement with our observations
and experimental reports in the literature. Overall, our microfluidic approach
allows access to unprecedentedly deep levels of supersaturation and reveals an
interesting interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in polymorphic
nucleation. The experimental methods and insights presented herein can be of
great interest, notably in the mineral processing and pharmaceutical industry.

Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit an extensive
variety of novel electronic properties, such as charge density wave quantum
spin Hall phenomena, superconductivity, and Dirac and Weyl semi-metallic
properties. The diverse properties of TMDs suggest that structural
transformation can be employed to switch between different electronic
properties. Intercalation and zero valence doping of molecules and atoms into
the van der Waals gap of TMDs have emerged as effective approaches to modify
the charge order states of the material. This eventually leads to phase
transition or the formation of different phases, thus expanding the electronic,
thermoelectric and optical applications of these materials. In this study,
electronic and electrochemical energy storage properties of such an
intercalated TMD, namely, 2H-TaSe 2 via intercalation of lithium (Li), sodium
(Na) and potassium (K) have been investigated. The intercalation of these ions
into the dichalcogenide resulted in a modified band structure and novel
structural effects, leading to the emergence of a 1 eV band gap. Possibility of
electrochemical energy storage application is also explored in this study.
Furthermore, the importance of multi orbital electron-electron correlations in
intercalated TaSe 2 is also investigated via dynamical-mean-field theory with
local density approximation.

Two dimensional materials are attracting new research for optoelectronics and
spintronics due to their unique physical properties. A wide range of emerging
spintronic devices are achieved from parent and doped two dimensional
materials. First-principles electronic structure calculations of a
two-dimensional monolayer of borophene in its P6/mmm form is explored in this
study. The electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of doped borophene are
analyzed for doping with lithium, sodium, and magnesium. Density functional
theory calculations advocate their good dynamical and thermal stability.
Spin-polarized electronic properties of these materials are observed to be
useful for predicting new spintronic materials. Additionally optical analysis
exhibits the absorption peaks in monolayers along the in-plane direction. These
properties of doped magnetic borophene suggest the material to be a suitable
candidate for designing optoelectronic devices. The most competent spintronic
material among three different doped borophenes is lithium doping that can
imply a promising avenue for the fast-growing electronics industry.

Vitreous silica is the most versatile material for scientific and commercial
applications. Although large-scale atomistic models of vitreous-SiO$_2$
(v-SiO$_2$) having medium-range order (MRO) have been successfully developed by
melt-quench through classical molecular dynamics, the MRO is not well studied
for the smaller-scale models developed by melt-quench using ab-initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD). In this study, we obtain atomistic models of v-SiO$_2$ by
performing melt-quench simulation using AIMD. The final structure is compared
with the experimental data and some recent atomistic models, on the basis of
the structural properties. Since AIMD allows for the estimation of electronic
structure, a detailed study of electronic properties is also done. It shows the
presence of defect states mainly due to dangling bonds in the band-gap region
of electronic density of states, whereas the edge-shared type of defective
structures in the glassy models are found to contribute mainly in the valence
band. In addition, Oxygen and Silicon vacancies as well as bridging Oxygen type
of defects were created and their contributions to the band-gap were studied.

<h3>Spin-Selective Electron Transport Through Single Chiral Molecules</h3>

The interplay between chirality and magnetism has been a source of
fascination among scientists for over a century. In recent years,
chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has attracted renewed interest. It
has been observed that electron transport through layers of homochiral
molecules leads to a significant spin polarization of several tens of percent.
Despite the abundant experimental evidence gathered through mesoscopic
transport measurements, the exact mechanism behind CISS remains elusive. In
this study, we report spin-selective electron transport through single helical
aromatic hydrocarbons that were sublimed in vacuo onto ferromagnetic cobalt
surfaces and examined with spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
(SP-STM) at a temperature of 5 K. Direct comparison of two enantiomers under
otherwise identical conditions revealed magnetochiral conductance asymmetries
of up to 50% when either the molecular handedness was exchanged or the
magnetization direction of the STM tip or Co substrate was reversed.
Importantly, our results rule out electron-phonon coupling and ensemble effects
as primary mechanisms responsible for CISS.

<h3>Transmission in graphene through a double laser barrier</h3>

<br>

<br>
In this work, we will study the transmission probability of Dirac fermions
through a double laser barrier. As part of the Floquet approximation, we will
determine the spinors in the five regions. Due to the continuity of the wave
function at the barrier edges, we find eight equations, each with infinity
modes. To simplify, we use the matrix formalism and limit our study to the
first three bands, the central band, and the first two side bands. From the
continuity equation and the spinors in the five regions, we will determine the
current density in each region, which makes it possible to determine the
expression of the transmission probability corresponding to each energy band.
The time-dependent laser fields generate several transmission modes, which give
two transmission processes: transmission with zero photon exchange corresponds
to the central band $\varepsilon$, and transmission with emission or absorption
of photons corresponds to the first two sidebands $\varepsilon\pm\varpi$. One
of the two modes can be suppressed by varying the distance between the two
barriers or the barrier width. The transmission is not permitted if the
incoming energy is below an energy threshold $\varepsilon>k_y+2\varpi$.
Increasing the intensity of the laser fields makes it possible to modify the
sharpness and amplitude of the transmission.

<h3>Stable Nanofacets in [111] Tilt Grain Boundaries of Face-Centered Cubic  Metals</h3>

Grain boundaries can dissociate into facets if that reduces their excess
energy. This, however, introduces line defects at the facet junctions, which
present a driving force to grow the facets in order to reduce the total number
of junctions and thus the system's energy. Often, micrometer-sized facet
lengths are observed and facet growth only arrests for kinetic reasons. So far,
energetically stable, finite-sized facets have not been observed, even though
theoretical stability conditions have already been proposed. Here, we show a
case where nanometer-sized facets are indeed stable compared to longer facets
in [111] tilt grain boundaries in Cu by atomistic simulation and transmission
electron microscopy. The facet junctions lack a Burgers vector component, which
is unusual, but which leads to attractive interactions via line forces.
Atomistic simulations predict that the same phenomenon also occurs in at least
Al and Ag.

The interplay between entropy transport and charge carriers-paramagnon
interaction in the Onsager linear system has been a subject of debate due to
the limited theoretical and experimental understanding of paramagnon heat
capacity. In this study, we investigate this interplay in an anisotropic
layered magnetic system using cluster mean-field theory with spin quantum
correlations. By examining spin correlation functions between different spins
with various types of clustering, we derive the spin correlation function as a
function of distance and temperature for the inter-layer clusters both below
and above the magnetic order phase transition. Our analysis reveals that
paramagnons characterized by pronounced spin correlations among inter-layer
nearest-neighbor spins exhibit a non-zero heat capacity, providing valuable
insights into the dynamics of entropy transport. The findings align with
experimental observations, lending strong support to the validity of the
paramagnon drag thermopower concept. This study sheds light on the intricate
dynamics and thermodynamic properties of paramagnons, advancing our
understanding of entropy transport in complex systems.

<h3>Entanglement transitions in a periodically driven non-Hermitian Ising  chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07661</a>
<br>
<i>Tista Banerjee, K. Sengupta</i>
<br>
<br>
We study entanglement transitions in a periodically driven Ising chain in the
presence of an imaginary transverse field $\gamma$ as a function of drive
frequency $\omega_D$. In the high drive amplitude and frequency regime, we find
a critical value $\gamma=\gamma_c$ below which the steady state half-chain
entanglement entropy, $S_{L/2}$, scales with chain length $L$ as $S_{L/2} \sim
\ln L/2$; in contrast, for $\gamma>\gamma_c$, it becomes independent of $L$. In
the small $\gamma$ limit, we compute the coefficient, $\alpha$, of the $\ln
L/2$ term analytically using a Floquet perturbation theory and trace its origin
to the presence of Fisher-Hartwig jump singularities in the correlation
function of the driven chain. We also study the frequency dependence of
$\gamma_c$ and show that $\gamma_c \to 0$ at special drive frequencies; at
these frequencies, which we analytically compute, $S_{L/2}$ remain independent
of $L$ for all $\gamma$. This behavior can be traced to an approximate emergent
symmetry of the Floquet Hamiltonian at these drive frequencies which we
identify. Finally, we discus the behavior of the driven system at low and
intermediate drive frequencies. Our analysis shows the presence of volume law
behavior of the entanglement in this regime $S_{\ell} \sim \ell$ for small
subsystem length $\ell \le \ell^{\ast}(\omega_D)$. We identify
$\ell^{\ast}(\omega_D)$ and tie its existence to the effective long-range
nature of the Floquet Hamiltonian of the driven chain for small subsystem size.
We discuss the applicability of our results to other integrable non-hermitian
models.

<h3>Fluctuating Entropy Production on the Coarse-Grained Level: Inference  and Localization of Irreversibility</h3>

Stochastic thermodynamics provides the framework to analyze thermodynamic
laws and quantities along individual trajectories of small but fully observable
systems. If the observable level fails to capture all relevant degrees of
freedom, some form of effective, coarse-grained dynamics naturally emerges for
which the principles of stochastic thermodynamics generally cease to be
applicable straightforwardly. Our work unifies the notion of entropy production
along an individual trajectory with that of a coarse-grained dynamics by
establishing a framework based on snippets and Markovian events as fundamental
building blocks. A key asset of a trajectory-based fluctuating entropy
production is the ability to localize individual contributions to the total
entropy production in time and space. As an illustration and potential
application for inference we introduce a method for the detection of hidden
driving. The framework applies equally to even and odd variables and,
therefore, includes the peculiar case of entropy production in underdamped
Langevin dynamics.

<h3>Critical behavior in self-consistent conserving approximations of  correlated electrons</h3>

<br>
<br>
We disclose a serious deficiency of the self-consistent conserving
approximations of strongly correlated electron systems. There are two vertices,
the divergence of each indicates a phase instability. We show that they
generically display incomplete and mutually inconsistent critical behavior at
different critical points. The dynamical vertex from the Schwinger-Dyson
equation cannot be continued beyond its singularity since it does not obey the
Ward identity and results in non-conserving response functions. The divergence
in the conserving vertex, obeying the conservation laws, does not invoke a
critical behavior of the spectral function and the specific heat. We
demonstrate this ubiquitous ambiguity on an example of the single-impurity
Anderson model. The dynamical vertex leads to strong coupling asymptotics with
a logarithmic Kondo scale, while the conserving vertex results in magnetic
instability of a spin-symmetric solution at a finite interaction strength.

<h3>Interlayer-spin-interaction-driven Sliding Ferroelectricity in a van der  Waals Magnetic Heterobilayer</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sliding ferroelectricity is widely existed in van der Waals (vdW)
two-dimensional (2D) multilayers, exhibiting great potential on low-dissipation
non-volatile memories. However, in a vdW heterostructure, interlayer sliding
usually fails to reverse or distinctly change the electric polarization, which
makes the electrical control difficult in practice. Here we propose that in a
vdW magnetic system, the interlayer spin interaction could provide an extra
degree-of-freedom to remarkably tune the electric polarization. Combining
tight-binding model analysis and first-principles calculations, we show that in
the CrI3/MnSe2 and other vdW magnetic heterobilayers, the switching of the
interlayer magnetic order can greatly change, even reverse the off-plane
electronic polarization. Furthermore, interlayer sliding causes a non-volatile
switching of the magnetic order and, thus, reverses the electric polarization,
suggesting a non-volatile magnetoelectric coupling effect. These findings will
significantly advances the development of 2D ferroelectrics and multiferroics
for spintronic applications.

<h3>Enhanced Non-linear Response by Manipulating the Dirac Point in the  (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface</h3>

<br>
<br>
Tunable spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an important feature for future
spin-based devices. In the presence of a magnetic field, SOI induces an
asymmetry in the energy bands, which can produce non-linear transport effects
($V\sim I^2$). Here, we focus on such effects to study the role of SOI in the
(111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. This system is a convenient platform for
understanding the role of SOI since it exhibits a single-band Hall-response
through the entire gate-voltage range studied. We report a pronounced rise in
the non-linear resistance at a critical in-plane field $H_{cr}$. This rise
disappears with a small out-of-plane field. We explain these results by
considering the location of the Dirac point formed at the crossing of the
spin-split energy bands. An in-plane magnetic field pushes this point outside
of the Fermi surface, and consequently changes the symmetry of the Fermi
contours and intensifies the non-linear transport. An out-of-plane magnetic
field opens a gap at the Dirac point, thereby significantly diminishing the
non-linear effects. We propose that magnetoresistance effects previously
reported in interfaces with SOI could be comprehended within our suggested
scenario.

<h3>Tolerance and breakdown of topological protection in a disordered  waveguide</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider a disordered waveguide consisting of trivial dielectric and
non-trivial magnetically anisotropic material. A topologically-protected edge
mode appears owing to the broken time-reversal symmetry of the non-trivial
lattice. While the edge mode maintains under other position and radius
disorders, the protection is immediately broken by applying a radius disorder
to the non-trivial lattice. This breakdown originates from donor and acceptor
modes occupying the topological bandgap. Furthermore, via the calculation of
the Bott index, we show that Anderson localization occurs as a metal conducting
gap changes to a topological gap along with increasing disorders.

It is well known that the partition function of two-dimensional Ising model
can be expressed as a Grassmann integral over the action bilinear in Grassmann
variables. The key aspect of the proof of this equivalence is to show that all
polygons, appearing in Grassmann integration, enter with fixed sign. For
three-dimensional model, the partition function can also be expressed by
Grassmann integral. However, the action resulting from low-temperature
expansion contains quartic terms, which does not allow explicit computation of
the integral. We wanted to check - apparently not explored - the possibility
that using the high-temperature expansion would result in action with only
bilinear terms. (in two dimensions, low-T and high-T expansions are equivalent,
but in three dimensions, they differ.) It turned out, however that polygons
obtained by Grassman integration are not of fixed sign for any ordering of
Grassmann variables on sites. This way, it is not possible to express the
partition function of three-dimensional Ising model as a Grassman integral over
bilinear action.

Chemical doping efficiently optimizes the physical properties of Heusler
compounds, especially their anomalous transport properties, including anomalous
Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC). This study
systematically investigates the effect of chemical doping on AHC and ANC in
1493 magnetic cubic Heusler compounds using high-throughput first-principles
calculations. Notable trends emerge in Co- and Rh-based compounds, where
chemical doping effectively enhances the AHC and ANC. Intriguingly, certain
doped candidates exhibit outstanding enhancement in AHCs and ANCs, such as
(Co$_{0.8}$Ni$_{0.2}$)$_2$FeSn with considerable AHC and ANC values of
$-2567.78$~S\,cm$^{-1}$ and $8.27$~A\,m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, respectively, and
(Rh$_{0.8}$Ru$_{0.2}$)$_2$MnIn with an AHC of $1950.49$~S\,cm$^{-1}$. In
particular, an extraordinary ANC of $8.57$~A\,m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ is identified
exclusively in Rh$_2$Co$_{0.7}$Fe$_{0.3}$In, nearly double the maximum value of
$4.36$~A\,m$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ observed in the stoichiometric Rh$_2$CoIn. A
comprehensive band structure analysis underscores that the notable enhancement
in ANC arises from the creation and modification of the energy-dependent nodal
lines through chemical doping. This mechanism generates a robust Berry
curvature, resulting in significant ANCs. These findings emphasize the pivotal
role of chemical doping in engineering high-performance materials, thereby
expanding the horizons of transport property optimization within Heusler
compounds.

<h3>Eleven Competing Phases in the Heisenberg-Gamma (J$Γ$) Ladder</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin-orbit generated $\Gamma$ interaction is known to induce strong
frustration and to be significant in realistic models of materials. To gain an
understanding of the possible phases that can arise from this interaction, it
is of considerable interest to focus on a limited part of parameter space in a
quasi one-dimensional model where high precision numerical results can be
obtained. Here we study the Heisenberg-Gamma (J$\Gamma$) ladder, determining
the complete zero temperature phase diagram by analyzing the entanglement
spectrum (ES) and energy susceptibility. A total of 11 different phases can be
identified. Two of the phases, the antiferromagnetic Gamma (A$\Gamma$) and
ferromagnetic Gamma (F$\Gamma$) phases, have previously been observed in the
Kitaev-Gamma ladder, demonstrating that the A$\Gamma$-phase is a symmetry
protected topological phase (SPT) protected by $TR\times \mathcal{R}_{b}$
symmetry, the product of time-reversal ($TR$) and $\pi$ rotation around the
$b$-axis ($\mathcal{R}_{b}$), while the F$\Gamma$-phase is related to a
rung-singlet phase through a local unitary transformation. Three other phases,
$\Upsilon$, $\Omega$ and $\delta$ show no conventional order, a doubling of the
entanglement spectrum and for the $\Upsilon$ and $\Omega$-phases a gap is
clearly present. The $\delta$-phase has a significantly smaller gap and
displays incommensurate correlations, with a peak in the static structure
factor, $S(k)$ continuously shifting from $k/\pi\mathord{=}2/3$ to
$k\mathord{=}\pi$. In the $\Omega$-phase we find pronounced edge-states
consistent with a SPT phase protected by the same $TR\times \mathcal{R}_{b}$
symmetry as the A$\Gamma$-phase. The precise nature of the $\Upsilon$ and
$\delta$-phases is less clear.

<h3>The effect of the stagnant layer on the photon mean-free-path length in  concentrated suspensions of nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<i>S.D. Balika</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the possibility of evaluation of the thickness and refractive
index of the stagnant layer in concentrated suspensions of nanoparticles
through the transport characteristics of scattered light photons. The analysis
is based on a physically-transparent generalization of the concept of the
single scattering intensity off systems in which the number of particles within
regions with linear sizes of order of the wavelength in the medium greatly
exceeds unity. This generalization is carried out within the notion of compact
groups of particles, makes it possible to go beyond the traditional Born
approximation, and take into account many-particle effects contributed from
those ranges of integration variables in the terms of the iteration series for
the scattered field where the internal propagators have delta-function-type
behavior. The evaluation of the photon transport characteristics becomes
possible without a detailed modeling of many-particle scattering and
correlation processes in the system. The photon mean-free-path length, $l$, is
investigated as a function of the stagnant refractive index and that of the
layer thickness to show a noticeable effect of both parameters on it. As the
layer refractive index is increased at a fixed layer thickness, $l$ decreases
because the suspension optical density increases. As a function of the layer
thickness, $l$ reveals different types of behavior, depending on the relation
between refractive indices of the stagnant layer and base liquid. If the former
is smaller than the latter, this behavior is increasing; in the opposite case,
it is decreasing. An experimentally observed increase of $l$ with the particle
concentration is explained as a manifestation of higher correlation effects.
Our theory reveals that the stagnant layer make the situation more complicated,
for both factors may either enhance or diminish each other.

<br>
<br>
The Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) quadrupole insulator model is a
cornerstone model for higher-order topological phases. It requires \pi flux
threading through each plaquette of the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model. Recent studies show that particular \pi-flux patterns can modify the
fundamental Brillouin zone from the shape of a torus to a Klein-bottle with
emerging topological phases. By designing different \pi-flux patterns, we
propose two types of Klein-bottle BBH models. These models show rich
topological phases including Klein-bottle quadrupole insulators and Dirac
semimetals. The phase with nontrivial Klein-bottle topology shows twined edge
modes at open boundaries. These edge modes can further support second-order
topology yielding a quadrupole insulator. Remarkably, both models are robust
against flux perturbations. Moreover, we show that different \pi-flux patterns
dramatically affect the phase diagram of the Klein-bottle BBH models. Going
beyond the original BBH model, Dirac semimetal phases emerge in Klein-bottle
BBH models featured by the coexistence of twined edge modes and bulk Dirac
points.

We report on the effect of magnetic impurities on the microscopic
superconducting (SC) properties of the kagome-lattice superconductor
La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ using muon spin relaxation/rotation
(${\mu}$SR). A strong suppression of the superconducting critical temperature
$T_{\rm c}$, the SC volume fraction, and the superfluid density was observed.
We furthermore find a correlation between the superfluid density and $T_{\rm
c}$ which is considered a hallmark feature of unconventional superconductivity.
Most remarkably, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration
depth ${\lambda}$ reveal a change in the low-temperature behavior from

introduces nodes in the superconducting gap structure at concentrations as low
as $x=$~0.015. Our results point to a rare example of unconventional
superconductivity in the correlated kagome lattice and accessible tunability of
the superconducting gap structure, offering new insights into the microscopic
mechanisms involved in superconducting order.

Through its capability for 3D mapping of Li at the nanoscale, atom probe
tomography (APT) is poised to play a key role in understanding the
microstructural degradation of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) during successive
charge and discharge cycles. However, APT application to materials for LIB is
plagued by the field induced delithiation (deintercalation) of Li-ions during
the analysis itself that prevents the precise assessment of the Li
distribution. Here, we showcase how a thin Cr-coating, in-situ formed on APT
specimens of NMC811 in the focused-ion beam (FIB), preserves the sample's
integrity and circumvent this deleterious delithiation. Cr-coated specimens
demonstrated remarkable improvements in data quality and virtually eliminated
premature specimen failures, allowing for more precise measurements via.
improved statistics. Through improved data analysis, we reveal substantial
cation fluctuations in commercial grade NMC811, including complete grains of
LiMnO. The current methodology stands out for its simplicity and
cost-effectiveness and is a viable approach to prepare battery cathodes and
anodes for systematic APT studies.

The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often
modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either modeling finite
material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date,
there is no direct derivation of the relation between discrete spring network,
and a general elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the networks'
mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally.
Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any
discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We
identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit
comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and
disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of
auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with
non-trivial geometries, is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and
opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.

<h3>The mass of simple and higher-order networks</h3>

We propose a theoretical framework that explains how the mass of simple and
higher-order networks emergences from their topology and their geometry. We use
the discrete topological Dirac operator to define an action for a massless
self-interacting topological Dirac field inspired by the Nambu-Jona Lasinio
model.The mass of the network is the result of the chiral symmetry breaking and
satisfies a self-consistent gap equation. Interestingly it is shown that the
mass of a network depends on its spectral properties, topology and geometry.
Due to the breaking of the matter-antimatter symmetry observed for the harmonic
modes of the discrete topological Dirac operator, two possible definitions of
the network mass can be given. For both possible definitions, the mass of the
network comes from a gap equation with the difference among the two definitions
encoded in the value of the bare mass. Indeed the bare mass can be determined
either by the Betti number $\beta_0$ or by the Betti number $\beta_1$ of the
network.We provide numerical results on the mass of different networks,
including random graphs, scale-free and real weighted collaboration networks.
We discuss also the generalization of these results to higher-order networks
defining the mass of simplicial complexes.

In a lattice model subject to a perpendicular magnetic field, when the
lattice constant is comparable to the magnetic length, one enters the
"Hofstadter regime," where continuum Landau levels become fractal magnetic
Bloch bands. Strong mixing between bands alters the nature of the resulting
quantum phases compared to the continuum limit; lattice potential, magnetic
field, and Coulomb interaction must be treated on equal footing. Using
determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) techniques, we study this regime numerically in the context of the
Hubbard-Hofstadter model on a triangular lattice. In the field-filling phase
diagram, we find a broad wedge-shaped region of ferromagnetic ground states for
filling factor $\nu \lesssim 1$, bounded by incompressible states at filling
factor $\nu = 1$. For magnetic field strengths $\Phi/\Phi_0 \lesssim 0.4$, we
observe signatures of SU(2) quantum Hall ferromagnetism in the lowest magnetic
Bloch band; however, we find no numerical evidence for conventional quantum
Hall skyrmions. At large fields $\Phi/\Phi_0 \gtrsim 0.4$, above the
ferromagnetic wedge, we observe a low-spin metallic region with spin
correlations peaked at small momenta. We argue that the phenomenology of this
region likely results from exchange interaction mixing fractal Hofstadter
subbands. The phase diagram derived beyond the continuum limit points to a rich
landscape to explore interaction effects in magnetic Bloch bands.

<h3>Vortex Lattices in Active Nematics with Periodic Obstacle Arrays</h3>

We numerically model a two-dimensional active nematic confined by a periodic
array of fixed obstacles. Even in the passive nematic, the appearance of
topological defects is unavoidable due to planar anchoring by the obstacle
surfaces. We show that a vortex lattice state emerges as activity is increased,
and that this lattice may be tuned from ``ferromagnetic'' to
``antiferromagnetic'' by varying the gap size between obstacles. We map the
rich variety of states exhibited by the system as a function of distance
between obstacles and activity, including a pinned defect state, motile
defects, the vortex lattice, and active turbulence. We demonstrate that the
flows in the active turbulent phase can be tuned by the presence of obstacles,
and explore the effects of a frustrated lattice geometry on the vortex lattice
phase.

<h3>Collective non-Hermitian skin effect: Point-gap topology and the  doublon-holon excitations in non-reciprocal many-body systems</h3>

Open quantum systems provide a plethora of exotic topological phases of
matter that has no Hermitian counterpart. Non-Hermitian skin effect,
macroscopic collapse of bulk states to the boundary, has been extensively
studied in various experimental platforms. However, it remains an open question
whether such topological phases persist in the presence of many-body
interactions. Notably, previous studies have shown that the Pauli exclusion
principle suppresses the skin effect. In this study, we present a compelling
counterexample by demonstrating the presence of the skin effect in
doublon-holon excitations. While the ground state of the spin-half
Hatano-Nelson model shows no skin effect, the doublon-holon pairs, as its
collective excitations, display the many-body skin effect even in strong
coupling limit. We rigorously establish the robustness of this effect by
revealing a bulk-boundary correspondence mediated by the point gap topology
within the many-body energy spectrum. Our findings underscore the existence of
non-Hermitian topological phases in collective excitations of many-body
interacting systems.

We develop an effective quantum electrodynamics for non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac
materials interacting with photons. These systems are described by Lorentz
invariant NH Dirac operators, featuring two velocity parameters $v_{_{\rm H}}$
and $v_{_{\rm NH}}$ associated with the standard Hermitian and a masslike
anti-Hermitian Dirac operators, respectively. They display linear
energy-momentum relation, however, in terms of an effective Fermi velocity
$v_{_{\rm F}}=\sqrt{v^2_{_{\rm H}}-v^2_{_{\rm NH}}}$ of NH Dirac fermions.
Interaction with the fluctuating electromagnetic radiation then gives birth to
an emergent Lorentz symmetry in this family of NH Dirac materials in the deep
infrared regime, where the system possesses a unique terminal velocity
$v_{_{\rm F}}=c$, with $c$ being the speed of light. While in two dimensions
such a terminal velocity is set by the speed of light in the free space,
dynamic screening in three spatial dimensions permits its nonuniversal values.
Manifestations of such an emergent spacetime symmetry on the scale dependence
of various physical observables in correlated NH Dirac materials are discussed.
