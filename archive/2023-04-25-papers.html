<h3>Hierarchical hydrodynamics in long-range multipole-conserving systems</h3>

This work investigates the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipole and
higher-moment conserving systems with long-range interactions, drawing
inspiration from trapped ion experiments in strongly tilted potentials. We
introduce a hierarchical sequence of multipole-conserving models characterized
by power-law decaying couplings. Although the moments are always globally
conserved, adjusting the power-law exponents of the couplings induces various
regimes in which only a subset of multipole moments are effectively locally
conserved. We examine the late-time hydrodynamics analytically and numerically
using an effective classical framework, uncovering a rich dynamical phase
diagram that includes subdiffusion, conventional diffusion, and L\'evy flights.
Our results are unified in an analytic reciprocal relationship that captures
the nested hierarchy of hydrodynamics in multipole conserving systems where
only a subset of the moments are locally conserved. Moreover, we extend our
findings to higher dimensions and explore the emergence of long-time scales,
reminiscent of pre-thermal regimes, in systems with low charge density. Lastly,
we corroborate our results through state-of-the-art numerical simulations of a
fully quantum long-range dipole-conserving system and discuss their relevance
to trapped-ion experimental setups.

<h3>Hydrodynamics in long-range interacting systems with center-of-mass  conservation</h3>

<br>
<br>
In systems with a conserved density, the additional conservation of the
center of mass (dipole moment) has been shown to slow down the associated
hydrodynamics. At the same time, long-range interactions generally lead to
faster transport and information propagation. Here, we explore the competition
of these two effects and develop a hydrodynamic theory for long-range
center-of-mass-conserving systems. We demonstrate that these systems can
exhibit a rich dynamical phase diagram containing subdiffusive, diffusive, and
superdiffusive behaviors, with continuously varying dynamical exponents. We
corroborate our theory by studying quantum lattice models whose emergent
hydrodynamics exhibit these phenomena.

<h3>Thermophoretic motion of a charged single colloidal particle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12841</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel B. Mayer, Dieter Braun, Thomas Franosch</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the thermophoretic drift of a charged single colloidal particle
with hydrodynamically slipping surface immersed in an electrolyte solution in
response to a small temperature gradient. Here, we rely on a linearized
hydrodynamic approach for the fluid flow and the motion of the electrolyte ions
while keeping the full nonlinearity of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation of the
unperturbed system to account for possible large surface charging. The partial
differential equations are transformed into a coupled set of ordinary
differential equations in linear response. Numerical solutions are elaborated
for parameter regimes of small and large Debye shielding and different
hydrodynamic boundary conditions encoded in a varying slip length. Our results
are in good agreement with predictions from recent theoretical work and
successfully describe experimental observations on thermophoresis of DNA. We
also compare our numerical results with experimental data on polystyrene beads.

<h3>Unifying Emergent Hydrodynamics and Lindbladian Low Energy Spectra  across Symmetries, Constraints, and Long-Range Interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13028" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13028</a>
<br>
<i>Olumakinde Ogunnaike, Johannes Feldmeier, Jong Yeon Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We identify emergent hydrodynamics governing charge transport in Brownian
random circuits with various symmetries, constraints, and ranges of
interactions. This is accomplished via a mapping between the averaged dynamics
and the low energy spectrum of a Lindblad operator, which acts as an effective
Hamiltonian in a doubled Hilbert space. By explicitly constructing dispersive
excited states of this effective Hamiltonian using a single mode approximation,
we provide a comprehensive understanding of diffusive, subdiffusive, and
superdiffusive relaxation in many-body systems with conserved multipole moments
and variable interaction ranges. Our approach further allows us to identify
exotic Krylov-space-resolved hydrodynamics exhibiting diffusive relaxation
despite the presence of dipole conservation, which we verify numerically. Our
approach provides a general and versatile framework to qualitatively understand
the dynamics of conserved operators under random unitary time evolution.

<h3>Attractive solution of binary Bose mixtures: Liquid-vapor coexistence  and critical point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12334" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12334</a>
<br>
<i>G. Spada, S. Pilati, S. Giorgini</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the thermodynamic behavior of attractive binary Bose mixtures using
exact path-integral Monte-Carlo methods. Our focus is on the regime of
interspecies interactions where the ground state is in a self-bound liquid
phase, stabilized by beyond mean-field effects. We calculate the isothermal
curves in the pressure vs density plane for different values of the attraction
strength and establish the extent of the coexistence region between liquid and
vapor using the Maxwell construction. Notably, within the coexistence region,
Bose-Einstein condensation occurs in a discontinuous way as the density jumps
from the normal gas to the superfluid liquid phase. Furthermore, we determine
the critical point where the line of first-order transition ends and
investigate the behavior of the density discontinuity in its vicinity. We also
point out that the density discontinuity at the transition could be observed in
experiments of mixtures in traps.

<h3>On elastic constants of zero-temperature amorphous solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12374</a>
<br>
<i>Grzegorz Szamel</i>
<br>
<br>
Elastic constants of zero-temperature amorphous solids are given as the
difference between the Born term, which results from a hypothetical affine
deformation of an amorphous solid, and a correction term which originates from
the fact that the deformation of an amorphous solid due to an applied stress
is, at the microscopic level, non-affine. Both terms are non-negative and thus
it is a priori not obvious that the resulting elastic constants are
non-negative. In particular, theories that approximate the correction term may
spuriously predict negative elastic constants and thus an instability of an
amorphous solid. Here we derive alternative expressions for elastic constants
of zero-temperature amorphous solids that are explicitly non-negative. These
expressions provide a useful blueprint for approximate theories for elastic
constants and sound damping in zero temperature amorphous solids.

<h3>Approaching the multicritical point of the two-dimensional dilute  Baxter-Wu model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12379</a>
<br>
<i>A.R.S. Macedo, A. Vasilopoulos, M. Akritidis, J.A. Plascak, N.G. Fytas, M. Weigel</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the critical behavior of the two-dimensional spin-$1$
Baxter-Wu model in the presence of a crystal-field coupling $\Delta$ with the
goal of determining the universality class of transitions along the
second-order part of the transition line and narrowing down the location of the
multicritical point. We employ extensive Monte Carlo simulations using two
different methodologies: (i) a study of the zeros of the energy probability
distribution, closely related to the Fisher zeros of the partition function,
and (ii) the well-established multicanonical approach employed to study the
probability distribution of the crystal-field energy. A detailed finite-size
scaling analysis in the regime of second-order phase transitions in the
$(\Delta, T)$ phase diagram supports previous claims that the transition
belongs to the universality class of the $4$-state Potts model. For positive
values of $\Delta$, on approaching the vicinity of the multicritical point, we
observe the presence of strong finite-size effects, indicative of crossover
effects due to the proximity of the first-order part of the transition line.
Finally, we demonstrate how a combination of cluster and heat-bath updates
allows one to equilibrate larger systems, and we demonstrate the potential of
this approach for resolving the ambiguities observed in the regime of $\Delta
\gtrsim 0$.

<br>
<br>
Reentrant superconductivity is a phenomenon in which the destructive effects
of magnetic field on superconductivity are mitigated, allowing a
zero-resistance state to survive under conditions that would otherwise destroy
it. Typically, the reentrant superconducting region derives from a zero-field
parent superconductor. Here, we show that in specifically-prepared UTe$_2$
crystals, extremely large magnetic field gives rise to an unprecedented high
field superconductor that lacks a zero-field parent phase. This orphan
superconductivity exists at fields between 37 T and 52 T, over a smaller
angular range than observed in superconducting UTe$_2$. The stability of
field-induced orphan superconductivity is a challenge to existing theoretical
explanations, and underscores the likelihood of a field-induced modification of
the electronic structure of UTe$_2$.

<h3>Generative Discovery of Novel Chemical Designs using Diffusion Modeling  and Transformer Deep Neural Networks with Application to Deep Eutectic  Solvents</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12400</a>
<br>
<i>Rachel K. Luu, Marcin Wysokowski, Markus J. Buehler</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a series of deep learning models to solve complex forward and
inverse design problems in molecular modeling and design. Using both diffusion
models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics and attention-based
transformer architectures, we demonstrate a flexible framework to capture
complex chemical structures. First trained on the QM9 dataset and a series of
quantum mechanical properties (e.g. homo, lumo, free energy, heat capacity,
etc.), we then generalize the model to study and design key properties of deep
eutectic solvents. In addition to separate forward and inverse models, we also
report an integrated fully prompt-based multi-task generative pretrained
transformer model that solves multiple forward, inverse design, and prediction
tasks, flexibly and within one model. We show that the multi-task generative
model has the overall best performance and allows for flexible integration of
multiple objectives, within one model, and for distinct chemistries, suggesting
that synergies emerge during training of this large language model. Trained
jointly in tasks related to the QM9 dataset and deep eutectic solvents (DESs),
the model can predict various quantum mechanical properties and critical
properties to achieve deep eutectic solvent behavior. Several novel
combinations of DESs are proposed based on this framework.

<h3>Modelling crystallization: When the normal growth velocity depends on  the supersaturation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12402</a>
<br>
<i>V. V. Ivanov, C. Tielemann, K. Avramova, S. Reinsch, V. Tonchev</i>
<br>
<br>
The crystallization proceeds by the advance of the crystal faces into the
disordered phase at the expense of the supersaturation which is not sustained
in our model. Using a conservation constraint for the transformation ratio and
a kinetic law, we derive a general equation for the rate of transformation. It
is integrated for the six combinations of the three spatial dimensions D = 1,
2, 3 and the two canonical values of the growth order (1 and 2). The same
equation with growth order 1 is obtained when taking only the linear term from
the Taylor's expansion around 0 transformation of the model of
Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov(JMAK). We verify our model by fitting it with
JMAK. We start the validation of our model in 2D with published results.

<h3>Fabry-Perot interferometry at the $ν$ = 2/5 fractional quantum Hall  state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12415" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12415</a>
<br>
<i>James Nakamura, Shuang Liang, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Michael J. Manfra</i>
<br>
<br>
Electronic Fabry-P{\'e}rot interferometry is a powerful method to probe
quasiparticle charge and anyonic braiding statistics in the fractional quantum
Hall regime. We extend this technique to the hierarchy $\nu = 2/5$ fractional
quantum Hall state, possessing two edge modes that in our device can be
interfered independently. The outer edge mode exhibits interference similar to
the behavior observed at the $\nu = 1/3$ state, indicating that the outer edge
mode at $\nu = 2/5$ has properties similar to the single mode at $\nu = 1/3$.
The inner mode shows an oscillation pattern with a series of discrete phase
jumps indicative of distinct anyonic braiding statistics. After taking into
account the impact of bulk-edge coupling, we extract an interfering
quasiparticle charge ${e^*} = 0.17 \pm 0.02$ and anyonic braiding phase $\theta
_a = (-0.43 \pm 0.05)\times 2\pi$, which serve as experimental verification of
the theoretically predicted values of $e^* = \frac{1}{5}$ and $\theta _a =
-\frac{4\pi}{5}$.

<h3>Quantum-limit phenomena and bandstructure in the magnetic topological  semimetal EuZn2As2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12426" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12426</a>
<br>
<i>Joanna Blawat, Smita Speer, John Singleton, Weiwei Xie, Rongying Jin</i>
<br>
<br>
We have experimentally investigated the low-temperature (0.6 K) electronic
and magnetic properties of the layered antiferromagnet EuZn2As2 in pulsed
magnetic fields of up to 60 T at a temperature of 0.6 K, giant positive
magnetoresistance (MR) is observed above \mu_{0}H ~ 20 T, a regime in which the
spins are already fully polarized. Both magnetic torque and proximity detector
oscillator (PDO) data show no corresponding anomaly at or close to this field.
By analyzing the quantum oscillations observed in the MR and PDO frequency, we
find that (1) the oscillation frequency F = 46 \pm 6 T for H // c and 42 \pm 2
T for H // ab; (2) the corresponding Berry phase is close to \pi for H // c,
implying a nontrivial topology; and (3) the large linear MR at high fields
corresponds to the quantum limit (i.e., only the last Landau level being
occupied). From these observations we conclude that the linear MR can be
understood by considering diffusing cyclotron centers in the quantum limit. Our
findings help understand the intimate relationship between magnetism and
electronic topology in EuZn2As2 under extremely high fields and suggest reasons
for the emergent behavior in the quantum limit.

<h3>Does incommensurability mean superlubricity?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12427" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12427</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Friction is a major source of energy loss in mechanical devices. This energy
loss may be reduced by creating interfaces with extremely reduced friction,
i.e. superlubricity. Conventional wisdom holds that incommensurate interface
structures facilitate superlubricity. In this study, we investigate if
incommensurability is a sufficient condition for superlubricity in
organic/metal interface systems. This is done using the example of two
well-characterized organic/metal interface systems using a combination of
density-functional theory and machine learning. We find that while
incommensurability clearly facilitates superlubricity, static distortion waves
can significantly impact the friction coefficient of the interface.

<h3>Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide  (Mo,Mn)Se$_2$ on 2D, 3D and polycrystalline substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12428</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic doping of 2D materials such as Transition Metal Dichalcogenides is
promising for the enhancement of magneto-optical properties, as it was
previously observed for 3D diluted magnetic semiconductors. To maximize the
effect of magnetic ions, they should be incorporated into the crystal lattice
of 2D material rather than form separated precipitates. This work shows a study
on incorporating magnetic manganese ions into the MoSe$_2$ monolayers using
molecular beam epitaxy. We test growth on various substrates with very
different properties: polycrystalline SiO$_2$ on Si, exfoliated 2D hexagonal
Boron Nitride flakes (placed on SiO$_2$ / Si), monocrystalline sapphire, and
exfoliated graphite (on tantalum foil). Although atomic force microscopy images
indicate the presence of MnSe precipitates, but at the same time, various
techniques reveal effects related to alloying MoSe$_2$ with Mn: Raman
scattering and photoluminescence measurements show energy shift related to the
presence of Mn, scanning transmission microscopy shows Mn induced partial
transformation of 1H to 1T^\prime phase. Above effects evidence partial
incorporation of Mn into the MoSe$_2$ layer.

<h3>Time, momentum, and energy resolved pump-probe tunneling spectroscopy of  two-dimensional electron systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Real-time probing of electrons can uncover intricate relaxation mechanisms
and many-body interactions hidden in strongly correlated materials. While
experimenters have used ultrafast optical pump-probe methods in bulk materials,
laser heating and insensitivity below the surface prevent their application to
encapsulated low-dimensional electron systems at millikelvin temperatures, home
to numerous intriguing electronic phases. Here, we introduce time, momentum,
and energy resolved pump-probe tunneling spectroscopy (Tr-MERTS). The method
allows the injection of electrons at particular energies and observation of
their subsequent decay in energy-momentum space. Using Tr-MERTS, we visualize
electronic decay processes in Landau levels with lifetimes up to tens of
microseconds. Although most observed features agree with simple
energy-relaxation, we discover an unexpected splitting in the nonequilibrium
energy spectrum in the vicinity of a ferromagnetic state. An exact
diagonalization study of the system suggests that the splitting arises from a
maximally spin-polarized higher energy state, distinct from a conventional
equilibrium skyrmion. Furthermore, we observe time-dependent relaxation of the
splitting, which we attribute to single-flipped spins forming topological spin
textures. These results establish Tr-MERTS as a powerful tool for studying the
dynamics and properties of a two-dimensional electronic system beyond
equilibrium.

<h3>Quantum dot Josephson junctions in the strong-coupling limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12456" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12456</a>
<br>
<i>Luka Pavešič, Ramón Aguado, Rok Žitko</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider an interacting quantum dot embedded in a Josephson junction
between two superconducting leads. By defining symmetry-adapted superpositions
of states from the leads, we formulate an effective model with a single orbital
directly coupled to the dot and three additional indirectly coupled orbitals.
This minimal basis set allows to account for the quasiparticles in the vicinity
of the dot that experience the Kondo exchange interaction, as well as
quasiparticles far away in the leads. This formulation reveals the changing
nature of the spin-doublet state in the strong coupling limit. We show that the
local moment in the quantum dot is strongly screened in the doublet state as
well, binding a quasiparticle in the same way as in the singlet state. This
explains the physical origin of the "doublet chimney" in the phase diagram: the
doublet and singlet states are nearly degenerate, with the doublet stabilized
by the residual coupling of an ``almost free'' quasiparticle resulting from the
Cooper-pair splitting by the quantum dot local moment.

<h3>Mechanical criticality of fiber networks at a finite temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12459</a>
<br>
<i>Sadjad Arzash, Anupama Gannavarapu, Fred C. MacKintosh</i>
<br>
<br>
At zero temperature, spring networks with connectivity below Maxwell's
isostatic threshold undergo a mechanical phase transition from a floppy state
at small strains to a rigid state for applied shear strain above a critical
strain threshold. Disordered networks in the floppy mechanical regime can be
stabilized by entropic effects at finite temperature. We develop a scaling
theory based on a real-space renormalization approach for this mechanical phase
transition at finite temperature, yielding relationships between various
scaling exponents. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify these scaling
relations and identify anomalous entropic elasticity with sub-linear
$T$-dependence in the linear elastic regime. While our results are consistent
prior studies of phase behavior near the isostatic point, the present work also
makes predictions relevant to the broad class of disordered thermal
semiflexible polymer networks for which the connectivity generally lies far
below the isostatic threshold.

<h3>Universal dynamics and non-thermal fixed points in quantum fluids far  from equilibrium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12464" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12464</a>
<br>
<i>Aleksandr N. Mikheev, Ido Siovitz, Thomas Gasenzer</i>
<br>
<br>
Closed quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can show universal
dynamics near attractor solutions, known as non-thermal fixed points,
generically in the form of scaling behavior in space and time. A systematic
classification and comprehensive understanding of such scaling solutions are
tasks of future developments in non-equilibrium quantum many-body theory. In
this tutorial review, we outline several analytical approaches to non-thermal
fixed points and summarize corresponding numerical and experimental results.
The analytic methods include a non-perturbative kinetic theory derived within
the two-particle irreducible effective-action formalism, as well as a
low-energy effective field theory framework. As one of the driving forces of
this research field are numerical simulations, we summarize the main results of
exemplary cases of universal dynamics in ultracold Bose gases. This encompasses
quantum vortex ensembles in turbulent superfluids as well as recently observed
real-time instanton solutions in one-dimensional spinor condensates.

<h3>Application of Generalized Periodic Anderson Hamiltonians to the  Superconducting Nickelates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12472</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishek Som, Nahom K. Yirga, David K. Campbell</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the extent to which a three-dimensional dispersing Periodic Anderson
Model (PAM) can explain the emergence of novel superconductivity in the
Infinite-Layer Nickelate compounds. By going beyond frequently used 2D models,
the 3D dispersing PAM allows us to incorporate effects of finite out-of-plane
hopping and orbital hybridization in describing these systems. Using an
unbiased functional Renormalization Group (fRG) approach, we show that
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductivity arises in a series of 3D {\it {ab-initio}}
models of the Nickelates ({\it {e.g.}}$\mathrm{RNiO_2}$), where R is a rare
earth element. We the study the impact of going beyond the Ni-d orbital by
including the R-$d_{z^2}$ and the interstitial-$s$ as hybridizing conducting
bands. We explore the dependence of the models on key parameters, including the
local Hubbard coupling, doping and temperature. We find the hybridization with
the interstitial-$s$ band driving a 3D $d_{z^2-r^2}$-type superconductivity
while out of plane hopping primarily enhances an $s$-wave superconducting

<h3>Magnetism and metal-insulator transitions in the anisotropic kagome  lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The interest in the physical properties of kagome lattices has risen
considerably. In addition to the synthesis of new materials, the possibility of
realizing ultracold atoms on an optical kagome lattice (KL) raises interesting
issues. For instance, by considering the Hubbard model on an anisotropic KL,
with a hopping $t^\prime$ along one of the directions, one is able to
interpolate between the Lieb lattice ($t^\prime=0$) and the isotropic KL
($t^\prime=t$). The ground state of the former is a ferrimagnetic insulator for
any on-site repulsion, $U$, while the latter displays a transition between a
paramagnetic metal and a Mott insulator. One may thus consider $t^\prime$ as a
parameter controlling the degree of magnetic frustration in the system. By
means of extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we have examined magnetic
and transport properties as $t^\prime$ varies between these limits in order to
set up a phase diagram in the $(U/t, t^\prime/t)$ parameter space. As an
auxiliary response, analysis of the average sign of the fermionic determinant
provides consistent predictions for critical points in the phase diagram. We
observe a metal-insulator transition occurring at some critical point
$U_c^\text{M}(t^\prime)$, which increases monotonically with $ t^\prime $, from
the unfrustrated lattice limit. In addition, we have found that the boundary
between the ferrimagnetic insulator and the Mott insulator rises sharply with
$t^\prime$.

<br>
<br>
In the cuprate superconductors, the spatial coherence of the charge density
wave (CDW) state grows rapidly below a characteristic temperature
$T_\mathrm{CDW}$, the nature of which is debated. We have combined a set of
x-ray scattering techniques to study La$_{1.88}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_{4}$
($T_\mathrm{CDW}$~$\approx$~80\,K) to shed light on this discussion. We observe
the emergence of a crystal structure, which is consistent with the CDW
modulation in symmetry, well above $T_\mathrm{CDW}$. This global structural
change also induces strong fluctuations of local atomic disorder in the
intermediate temperature region. At $T_\mathrm{CDW}$, the temperature
dependence of this structure develops a kink, while the atomic disorder is
minimized. We find that the atomic relaxation dynamics cross over from a
cooperative to an incoherent response at $T_\mathrm{CDW}$. These results reveal
a rich interplay between the CDWs and atomic fluctuations of distinct
spatio-temporal scales. For example, the CDW coherence is enhanced on
quasi-elastic timescales by incoherent atomic relaxation.

<h3>Effects of Oxidation on the Tribological Properties of Diamond Sliding  Against Silica. Insights from Ab initio Molecular Dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Tribological phenomena such as adhesion, friction, and wear can undermine the
functionality of devices and applications based on the diamond-silica
interface. Controlling these phenomena is highly desirable, but difficult since
extrinsic factors, such as the surface termination by adsorbed species, can
deeply affect the reactivity of diamond and its resistance to wear. In this
work, we investigate the effects of diamond oxidation by massive ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations of silica sliding against diamond surfaces
considering different surface orientations, O-coverages, and tribological
conditions. Our findings reveal a dual role of oxygen that depends on coverage.
At full coverage, the adsorbed oxygen is very effective in friction and wear
reduction because the repulsion with the silica counter-surface prevents the
formation of chemical bonds across the interface. At reduced coverage and high
pressure, Si-O-C bonds are anyway established. In this situation the presence
of oxygen results detrimental as it weakens the surface C-C bonds making the
surface more vulnerable to wear. Indeed we observed atomic wear on the C(110)
surface at 50% O-coverage under harsh tribological conditions. The mechanisms
of friction reduction and atomistic wear are explained through the analysis of
the electronic properties and surface-surface interactions. Overall, our
accurate in silico experiments shed light into the effects of adsorbed oxygen
on the tribological behavior of diamond and show how oxidized diamond can be
worn by silica.

<h3>The anti-symmetric and anisotropic symmetric exchange interactions  between electric dipoles in hafnia</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12531</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The anti-symmetric and anisotropic symmetric exchange interactions between
two magnetic dipole moments - responsible for intriguing magnetic textures
(e.g., magnetic skyrmions) - have been discovered since last century, while
their electric analogues were either hidden for a long time or still not known.
As a matter of fact, it is only recently that the anti-symmetric exchange
interactions between electric dipoles was proved to exist (with materials
hosting such an interaction being still rare) and the existence of anisotropic
symmetric exchange interaction between electric dipoles remains to be revealed.
Here, by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify a
candidate material in which our aforementioned exchange interactions between
electric dipoles are perceptible. More precisely, we find that various phases
of hafnia showcase non-collinear alignment of electric dipoles, which is
interpreted by our phenomenological theories. This gives evidence that hafnia
simultaneously accommodates anti-symmetric and anisotropic symmetric exchange
interactions between electric dipoles. Our findings can hopefully deepen the
current knowledge of electromagnetism in ferroelectrics, magnets and
multiferroics, and have a potential to guide the discovery of novel states of
matter (e.g., electric skyrmions) in hafnia and related materials.

<h3>Magnetocaloric effect and its electric-field regulation in CrI$_3$/metal  heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<br>
The extraordinary properties of a heterostructure by stacking atom-thick van
der Waals (vdW) magnets have been extensively studied. However, the
magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of heterostructures that are based on monolayer
magnets remains to be explored. Herein, we deliberate MCE of vdW
heterostructure composed of a monolayer CrI$_3$ and metal atomic layers (Ag,
Hf, Au, and Pb). It is revealed that heterostructure engineering by introducing
metal substrate can improve MCE of CrI$_3$, particularly boosting relative
cooling power to 471.72 $\mu$Jm$^{-2}$ and adiabatic temperature change to 2.1
K at 5 T for CrI$_3$/Hf. This improved MCE is ascribed to the enhancement of
magnetic moment and intralayer exchange coupling in CrI$_3$ due to the
CrI$_3$/metal heterointerface induced charge transfer. Electric field is
further found to tune MCE of CrI$_3$ in heterostructures and could shift the
peak temperature by around 10 K in CrI$_3$/Hf, thus manipulating the working
temperature window of MCE. The discovered electric-field and substrate
regulated MCE in CrI$_3$/metal heterostructure opens new avenues for
low-dimensional magnetic refrigeration.

<h3>Bose-Einstein condensations of magnons in quantum magnets with  spin-orbit coupling in a Zeeman field</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the response of a quantum magnet with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to a
Zeeman field by constructing effective actions and performing Renormalization
Group (RG) analysis. There are several novel classes of quantum phase
transitions at a low $ h_{c1} $ and an upper critical field $ h_{c2} $ driven
by magnon condensations at commensurate (C-) or in-commensurate (IC-) momenta $
0 < k_0 < \pi $. The intermediate IC- Skyrmion crystal (IC-SkX) phase is
controlled by a line of fixed points in the RG flows labeled by $ k_0 $. We
derive the relations between the quantum spin and the order parameters of the
effective actions which determine the spin-orbital structures of the IC-SkX
phase. We also analyze the operator contents near $ h_{c1} $ and $ h_{c2} $
which determine the exotic excitation spectra inside the IC-SkX. The intrinsic
differences between the magnon condensations at the C- and IC- momenta are
explored. The two critical fields $ h_{c1} < h_{c2} $ and the intermediate
IC-SkX phase could be a generic feature to any quantum magnets with SOC in a
Zeeman field. Experimental implications to some materials or cold atom systems
with SOC in a Zeeman field are presented.

<h3>Ferroelectric domain wall clusters in barium titanate</h3>

<br>
<i>Chris Halcrow, Egor Babaev</i>
<br>
<br>
We study ferroelectric domain walls in barium titanate. We search for
structurally nontrivial, so-called non-Ising domain walls, where the
Polarisation is non-zero along the entire wall. Our approach enables us to find
solutions for domain walls in any orientation, and the existence and energy of
these walls depend on their particular orientation. We find that, across all
phases of the material, there are orientations where the non-Ising walls have
lower energy than Ising walls. The most interesting property of these domain
walls is their non-monotonic interaction forces, allowing them to form stable
domain-wall clusters rather than following standard behavior where domain walls
annihilate or repel each other. We found the required external electric field
to create the non-Ising configurations. Besides theoretical interest, this
unconventional property of domain walls makes them a good candidate for memory
application.

Superconducting topological materials have generated considerable interest in
condensed matter research due to their unusual gap structures and topological
properties. In this study, we have investigated the normal and superconducting
characteristics of a potential topological semimetal 1$T$-NbSeTe through
comprehensive transport and magnetization measurements on bulk single crystals.
The results suggest the topological semimetallic nature of NbSeTe, evidenced by
the observation of the planar Hall effect. Moreover, it displays quasi-2D
anisotropic superconductivity, which breaks the Pauli limit. The coexistence of
the topological semimetallic nature and superconductivity in NbSeTe makes it a
potential contender for topological superconductivity.

<br>
<br>
The phenomenon of confinement is well known in high-energy physics and can
also be realized for low-energy domain-wall excitations in one-dimensional
quantum spin chains. A bound state consisting of two domain-walls can behave
like a meson, and in a recent work of Vovrosh et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 040309
(2022)] , it was demonstrated that a pair of mesons could dynamically form a
meta-stable confinement-induced bound state (consisting of four domain-walls)
akin to a hadronic state. However, the protocol discussed in Vovrosh et al.
[PRX Quantum 3, 040309 (2022)] involving the use of interactions with
characteristically non-monotonic distance dependence is not easy to come by in
nature, thus, posing a challenge for its experimental realization. In this
regard, Rydberg atoms can provide the required platform for simulating
confinement-related physics. We exploit the flexibility offered by interacting
Rydberg-dressed atoms to engineering modified spin-spin interactions for the
one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our numerical simulations show
how Rydberg-dressed interactions can give rise to a variety of effective
potentials that are suitable for hadron formation, which opens the possibility
of simulating confinement physics with Rydberg platforms as a viable
alternative to current trapped-ion experiments.

Electrical switching of magnetization via spin-orbit torque (SOT) is of great

logic technologies. Recently, enormous efforts have been stimulated to
investigate switching of perpendicular magnetization in van der Waals systems
that have unique, strong tunability and spin-orbit coupling effect compared to
conventional metals. In this review, we first give a brief, generalized
introduction to the spin-orbit torque and van der Waals materials. We will then
discuss the recent advances in magnetization switching by the spin current
generated from van der Waals materials and summary the progress in the
switching of Van der Waals magnetization by the spin current.

Higher-dimensional topological meta-materials have more flexible than
one-dimensional topological materials, which are more convenient to apply and
solve practical problems. However, in diffusion systems, higher-dimensional
topological states have not been well studied. In this work, we experimentally
realized the 2D topological structure based on a kagome lattice of thermal
metamaterial. Due to the anti-Hermitian properties of the diffusion
Hamiltonian, it has purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to the decay
rate. By theoretical analysis and directly observing the decay rate of
temperature through experiments, we present the various corner states in 2D
topological diffusive system. Our work constitutes the first realization of
multiple corner states with high decay rates in a pure diffusion system, which
provides a new idea for the design of topological protected thermal
metamaterial in the future.

<h3>Imperfectly coordinated water molecules pave the way for homogeneous ice  nucleation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Water freezing is ubiquitous on Earth, affecting many areas from biology to
climate science and aviation technology. Probing the atomic structure in the
homogeneous ice nucleation process from scratch is of great value but still
experimentally unachievable. Theoretical simulations have found that ice
originates from the low-mobile region with increasing abundance and persistence
of tetrahedrally coordinated water molecules. However, a detailed microscopic
picture of how the disordered hydrogen-bond network rearranges itself into an
ordered network is still unclear. In this work, we use a deep neural network
(DNN) model to "learn" the interatomic potential energy from quantum mechanical
data, thereby allowing for large-scale and long molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with ab initio accuracy. The nucleation mechanism and dynamics at
atomic resolution, represented by a total of 36 $\mu$s-long MD trajectories,
are deeply affected by the structural and dynamical heterogeneity in
supercooled water. We find that imperfectly coordinated (IC) water molecules
with high mobility pave the way for hydrogen-bond network rearrangement,
leading to the growth or shrinkage of the ice nucleus. The hydrogen-bond
network formed by perfectly coordinated (PC) molecules stabilizes the nucleus,
thus preventing it from vanishing and growing. Consequently, ice is born
through competition and cooperation between IC and PC molecules. We anticipate
that our picture of the microscopic mechanism of ice nucleation will provide
new insights into many properties of water and other relevant materials.

We consider superconductor-normal-superconductor-normal-superconductor
(SNSNS) planar Josephson junctions in hole systems with spin-orbit interaction
that is cubic in momentum (CSOI). Utilizing only the superconducting phase
difference, we find parameter `sweet spots' for reasonable junction
transparencies that result in a topological region of phase space, within which
Majorana bound states (MBSs) appear at the ends of the junction. In planar
germanium hetereostructures CSOI can be the dominant form of SOI and extremely
strong. We show analytically and numerically that, within experimental regimes,
our results provide an achievable roadmap for a new MBS platform with low
disorder, minimal magnetic fields, and very strong spin-orbit interaction,
overcoming many of the key deficiencies that have so far prevented the
conclusive observation of MBSs.

<h3>Multicritical Bifurcation and First-order Phase Transitions in a  Three-dimensional Blume-Capel Antiferromagnet</h3>

<i>Daniel Silva, Gloria M. Buendia, Per Arne Rikvold</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a detailed study by Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size
scaling analysis of the phase diagram and ordered bulk phases for the
three-dimensional Blume-Capel antiferromagnet in the space of temperature and
magnetic and crystal fields (or two chemical potentials in an equivalent
lattice-gas model with two particle species and vacancies). The phase diagram
consists of surfaces of second- and first-order transitions that enclose a
``volume'' of ordered phases in the phase space. At relatively high
temperatures, these surfaces join smoothly along a line of tricritical points,
and at zero magnetic field we obtain good agreement with known values for
tricritical exponent ratios [Y. Deng and H.W.J. Bl{\"o}te, Phys. Rev. E {70},
0456111 (2004)]. In limited field regions at lower temperatures (symmetric
under reversal of the magnetic field), the tricritical line for this
three-dimensional model bifurcates into lines of critical endpoints and
critical points, connected by a surface of weak first-order transitions
{inside} the region of ordered phases. This phenomenon is not seen in the
two-dimensional version of the same model. We confirm the location of the
bifurcation as previously reported [Y.L. Wang and J.D. Kimel, J. Appl. Phys.
{69}, 6176 (1991)], and we identify the phases separated by this first-order
surface as antiferromagnetically (three-dimensional checker-board) ordered with
different vacancy densities. We visualize the phases by real-space snapshots
and by structure factors in the three-dimensional space of wave vectors.

For 2D Hubbard model with spin-orbit Rashba coupling in external magnetic
field the structure of effective spin interactions is studied in the regime of
strong electron correlations and at half-filling. It is shown that in the third
order of perturbation theory, the scalar and vector chiral spin-spin
interactions of the same order arise. The emergence of the latter is due to
orbital effects of magnetic field. It is shown that for nonuniform fields,
scalar chiral interaction can lead to stabilization of axially symmetric
skyrmion states with arbitrary topological charges. Taking into account the
hierarchy of effective spin interactions, an analytical theory on the optimal
sizes of such states -- the higher-order magnetic skyrmions -- is developed for
axially symmetric magnetic fields of the form $h(r) \sim r^{\beta}$ with $\beta
\in \mathbb{R}$.

<br>
<i>Ori Grossman, Erez Berg</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the electronic spectral function of a metal in the vicinity of an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum critical point, focusing on a situation where
the bare bandwidth of the spin fluctuations is significantly smaller than the
Fermi energy. In this limit, we identify a range of energies where the
fermionic quasiparticles near the "hot spots'' on the Fermi surface are
strongly scattered by the quantum critical fluctuations, whereas the damping of
the AFM fluctuations by the electrons is negligible. Within a one-loop
approximation, there is a parameter range where the $T=0$ spectral function at
the hot spots has a "precursor gap'' feature, with a local maximum at a finite
frequency. However, the ratio of the bare spin wave velocity to the Fermi
velocity required to obtain a precursor gap is probably too small to explain
experiments in the electron-doped cuprate superconductors (He et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci 116, 3449 (2019)). At lower frequencies, the Landau damping of
the AFM fluctuations becomes important, and the electronic spectral function
has the familiar ${\omega}^{-1/2}$ singularity. Our one-loop perturbative
results are supported by a numerical Monte Carlo simulation of electrons
coupled to an undamped, nearly-critical AFM mode.

<h3>Magnetism-induced band-edge shift as mechanism for magnetoconductance in  CrPS$_4$ transistors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Transistors realized on multilayers of 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor
CrPS$_4$ exhibit large, gate-tunable low-temperature magnetoconductance, due to
changes in magnetic state induced by the applied magnetic field. The
microscopic mechanism coupling the conductance to the magnetic state is however
not understood. We identify this mechanism by analyzing the evolution with
temperature and magnetic field of the parameters determining the transistor
behavior, the carrier mobility and threshold voltage. We find that for
temperatures $T$ close to the n\'eel temperature $T_N$, the magnetoconductance
originates from the increase in mobility due to cooling or the applied magnetic
field, which reduce disorder originating from spin fluctuations. For $T<<T_N$,
the mechanism is entirely different: the mobility is field and temperature
independent, and what changes is the threshold voltage, so that increasing the
field at fixed gate voltage increases the density of accumulated electrons. The
change in threshold voltage is due to a shift in the conduction band-edge as
confirmed by \emph{ab-initio} calculations that capture the magnitude of the
effect. Our results demonstrate that the bandstructure of CrPS$_4$ depends on
its magnetic state and reveal a mechanism for magnetoconductance in transistors
that had not been identified earlier and that is of general validity for
magnetic semiconductors.

Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local
symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics
ranging from fundamental interactions, to statistical mechanics, condensed
matter and more recently quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep
understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum
technology, lower energy analogs, capable to capture important features of the
original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been
intensively studied. Here, we study lattice gauge theories constrained to
mesoscopic spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons
residing in a ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective
magnetic field. We demonstrate that, in these conditions, mesons are
characterized by unique features. We find a new type of Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations reflecting the coupling between the magnetic field and the
internal structure of the meson. The coherence properties of the meson are
quantified by the persistent current and by specific features of the
correlation functions. When the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations and mesoscopic features of the meson current and correlations
start a specific matter-wave dynamics.

<h3>Random organization and non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids on a sphere</h3>

Random organizing hyperuniform fluid induced by reciprocal activation is a
non-equilibrium fluid with vanishing density fluctuations at large length
scales like crystals. Here we extend this new state of matter to a closed
manifold, namely a spherical surface. We find that the random organization on a
spherical surface behaves similar to that in two dimensional Euclidean space,
and the absorbing transition on a sphere also belongs to the conserved directed
percolation universality class. Moreover, the reciprocal activation can also
induce a non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluid on a sphere. The spherical
structure factor at the absorbing transition and the non-equilibrium
hyperuniform fluid phases are scaled as $S(l \rightarrow 0) \sim (l/R)^{0.45}$
and $S(l \rightarrow 0) \sim l(l+1)/R^2$, respectively, which are both
hyperuniform according to the definition of hyperuniformity on a sphere with
$l$ the wave number and $R$ the radius of the spherical surface. We also
consider the impact of inertia in realistic hyperuniform fluids, and it is
found only adding an extra length-scale, above which hyperuniform scaling
appears. Our finding suggests a new method for creating non-equilibrium
hyperuniform fluids on closed manifolds to avoid boundary effects.

We perform a thorough analysis of a non-Hermitian (NH) version of a tight
binding chain comprising of two orbitals per unit cell. The non-Hermiticity is
further bifurcated into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases, respectively,
characterized by non-reciprocal nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes and purely
imaginary onsite potential energies. The studies on the localization and the
topological properties of our models reveal several intriguing results. For
example, they have complex energy gaps with distinct features, that is, a line
gap for the non-PT symmetric case and a point gap for the PT symmetric case.
Further, the NH skin effect, a distinctive feature of the NH system, is
non-existent here and is confirmed via computing the local density of states.
The bulk-boundary correspondence for both the NH variants obeys a bi-orthogonal
condition. Moreover, the localization of the edge modes obtained via the
inverse participation ratio shows diverse dependencies on the parameters of the
Hamiltonian. Also, the topological properties are discernible from the
behaviour of the topological invariant, namely, the complex Berry phase, which
shows a sharp transition from a finite value to zero. Interestingly, the PT
symmetric system is found to split between a PT broken and an unbroken phase
depending on the values of the parameters. Finally, the results are benchmarked
with the Hermitian model to compare and contrast those obtained for the NH
variants.

<h3>Emergence of Directed Motion in a Crowded Suspension of Overdamped  Particles</h3>

In this work, we focus on the behavior of a single passive Brownian particle
in a suspension of passive particles with short-range repulsive interactions
and a larger self-diffusion coefficient. While the forces affecting the
single-particle are thermal-like fluctuations and repulsion, due to other
particles in the suspension, our numerical simulations show that on
intermediate time scales directed motion on a single-particle level emerges.
This emergent directional motion leads to a breakdown of the Einstein relation
and non-monotonic augmentation of the measured diffusion coefficient.
Directional tendency increases with the density of the suspension and leads to
growth of the diffusivity with the density of the suspension, a phenomenon
recently observed for a system of hard spheres by Ilker, Castellana, and
Joanny. Counter-intuitively, the directional flow originates from the tendency
of different particles to push each other out of their way. Due to such
strictly repulsive interactions, nearby particles form into temporally
correlated pairs and move cooperatively, thus creating a preferred direction of
motion on intermediate time scales. We show that directional motion emerges
when the ratio of the self-diffusion coefficients of the tracked particle and
suspension constituents is below a critical value.

Recently, higher-order topological phases have endowed materials many exotic
topological phases. For three-dimensional (3D) higher-order topologies, it
hosts topologically protected 1D hinge states or 0D corner states, which extend
the bulk-boundary correspondence of 3D topological phases. Meanwhile, the
enrichment of group symmetries with exploration of projective symmetry algebras
redefined the fundamentals of nontrivial topological matter with artificial
gauge fields, leading to the discovery of new topological phases in classical
wave systems. In this Letter, we construct an acoustic topological semimetal
characterized by both the first and the second Stiefel-Whitney (SW) topological
charges by utilizing the projective symmetry. Different from conventional
high-order topologies with multiple bulk-boundary correspondences protected by
different class topological invariants, acoustic high-order Stiefel-Whitney
semimetal (HOSWS) has two different bulk-edge correspondences protected by only
one class (SW class) topological invariant. Two types of topological hinge and
surface states are embedded in bulk bands at the same frequency, featuring
similar characteristics of bound states in the continuum (BICs). In
experiments, we demonstrate the existence of high-quality surface state and
hinge state at the interested frequency window with polarized intensity field
distributions.

In topological phase transitions involving a change in topological invariants
such as the Chern number and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant, the gap
closes, and the electric polarization becomes undefined at the transition. In
this paper, we show that the jump of polarization across such topological phase
transitions in two dimensions is described in terms of positions and monopole
charges of Weyl points in the intermediate Weyl semimetal phase. We find that
the jump of polarization is described by the Weyl dipole at $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological phase transitions and at phase transitions without any change in
the value of the Chern number. Meanwhile, when the Chern number changes at the
phase transition, the jump is expressed in terms of the relative positions of
Weyl points measured from a reference point in the reciprocal space.

Ren\'e 41 is a cast and wrought Ni-based superalloy with high yield strength
and stress-rupture properties contrasted with poor processability. The aim of
this thesis is to systematically investigate the influence of C and B
microalloying additions on processability of Ren\'e 41. The first approach is
an experimental one using hot compression testing and material
characterisation. A second approach using machine learning methodology was also
used to provide linkage for the experimental observations with industrial
Ren\'e 41 materials based on ultrasonic defects and chemical composition. Three
Ren\'e 41 variants with nominal, high C, and high B compositions were
industrially fabricated and homogenized to be used in this study. The resultant
flow stresses from hot compression testing were used to model hyperbolic sine
constitutive equations. The activation energy for hot deformation was found to
be 757, 728, and 697 kJmol-1 for the nominal, high B, and high C Ren\'e 41
variants respectively. Finite element method simulations based on the obtained
flow curves found that effective plastic strain varied considerably through the
sample geometry. Quantitative analysis via electron back-scatted diffraction
found that while the three Ren\'e 41 variants have nearly identical
recrystallised grain size, high C contain 64 vol.% recrystallised fractions
compared to that of the nominal variant with 31 vol.% at the same deformation
condition.

Bottom-up grown nanomaterials play an integral role in the development of
quantum technologies. Among these, semiconductor nanowires (NWs) are widely
used in proof-of-principle experiments, however, difficulties in parallel
processing of conventionally-grown NWs makes scalability unfeasible. Here, we
harness selective area growth (SAG) to remove this road-block. We demonstrate
large scale integrated SAG NW circuits consisting of 512 channel
multiplexer/demultiplexer pairs, incorporating thousands of interconnected SAG
NWs operating under deep cryogenic conditions. Multiplexers enable a range of
new strategies in quantum device research and scaling by increase the device
count while limiting the number of connections between room-temperature control
electronics and the cryogenic samples. As an example of this potential we
perform a statistical characterization of large arrays of identical SAG quantum
dots thus establishing the feasibility of applying cross-bar gating strategies
for efficient scaling of future SAG quantum circuits.

The oscillation of fluctuation with two state observables is investigated.
Following the idea of Ohga, et al. [arXiv:2303.13116], we find that the
fluctuation oscillation relative to their autocorrelations is bounded from
above by the entropy production per characteristic maximum oscillation time.
Our result applies to a variety of systems including Langevin systems, chemical
reaction systems, and macroscopic systems. In addition, our bound consists of
experimentally tractable quantities, which enables us to examine our inequality
experimentally.

We have demonstrated the fabrication of both armchair and zigzag epitaxial
graphene nanoribbon (GNR) devices on 4H-SiC using a polymer-assisted
sublimation growth method. The phenomenon of terrace step formation has
traditionally introduced the risk of GNR deformation along sidewalls, but a
polymer-assisted sublimation method helps mitigate this risk. Each type of 50
nm wide GNR is examined electrically and optically (armchair and zigzag), with
the latter method being a check on the quality of the GNR devices and the
former using alternating current to investigate resistance attenuation from
frequencies above 100 Hz. Rates of attenuation are determined for each type of
GNR device, revealing subtle suggested differences between armchair and zigzag
GNRs.

<h3>Dynamical process of a bit-width reduced Ising model with simulated  annealing</h3>

Ising machines have attracted attention as fast and high-precision solvers
for combinatorial optimization problems, which are often formulated as
ground-state (lowest-energy) search problems of the Ising model. Since the
bit-width of coefficients on Ising machines is limited, the Ising model must be
transformed into the Ising model with the bit-width reduced to correspond to a
specific Ising machine. One bit-width reduction method adds auxiliary spins to
transform into a bit-width reduced (BWR) Ising model in which the ground states
are theoretically the same as those of the Ising model before bit-width
reduction (original Ising model). Herein we compare the dynamical processes of
the original Ising model and the BWR Ising model via the bit-width reduction
method. Simulated annealing (SA) shows that the dynamical process differs
significantly by model. Analysis from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics
found that the BWR Ising model with added auxiliary spins has two
characteristic properties: an effective temperature and a slow relaxation.
These properties are derived from the entropy effects of the auxiliary spins,
which are not present in the original Ising model. Moreover, to obtain the same
dynamical process as the original Ising model, we proposed SA parameters for
the BWR Ising model. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the dynamical
process of the BWR Ising model with the proposed SA parameters are close to
that of the original Ising model.

<h3>The effect of scatter of polymer chain length on strength</h3>

<br>
A polymer network fractures by breaking covalent bonds, but the
experimentally measured strength of the polymer network is orders of magnitude
lower than the strength of covalent bonds. We investigate the effect of
statistical variation of the number of links in polymer chains on strength
using a parallel chain model. Each polymer chain is represented by a
freely-jointed chain, with a characteristic J-shaped force-extension curve. The
chain carries entropic forces for most of the extension and carries covalent
forces only for a narrow range of extension. The entropic forces are orders of
magnitude lower than the covalent forces. Chains with a statistical
distribution of the number of links per chain are pulled between two rigid
parallel plates. Chains with fewer links attain covalent forces and rupture at
smaller extensions, while chains with more links still carry entropic forces.
We compute the applied force on the rigid plates as a function of extension and
define the strength of the parallel chain model by the maximum force divided by
the total number of chains. With the J-shaped force-extension curve of each
chain, even a small scatter in the number of links per chain greatly reduces
the strength of the parallel chain model. We further show that the strength of
the parallel chain model relates to the scatter in the number of links per
chain according to a power law.

<h3>Symmetry-projected cluster mean-field theory applied to spin systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
We introduce $S_z$ spin-projection based on cluster mean-field theory and
apply it to the ground state of strongly-correlated spin systems. In cluster
mean-field, the ground state wavefunction is written as a factorized tensor
product of optimized cluster states. In previous work, we have focused on
unrestricted cluster mean-field, where each cluster is $S_z$ symmetry adapted.
We here remove this restriction by introducing a generalized cluster mean-field
(GcMF) theory, where each cluster is allowed to access all $S_z$ sectors,
breaking $S_z$ symmetry. In addition, a projection scheme is used to restore
global $S_z$, which gives rise to $S_z$ spin-projected generalized cluster
mean-field (S$_z$GcMF). Both of these extensions contribute to accounting for
inter-cluster correlations. We benchmark these methods on the 1D, quasi-2D, and
2D $J_1-J_2$ and $XXZ$ Heisenberg models. Our results indicate that the new
methods (GcMF and S$_z$GcMF) provide a qualitative and semi-quantitative
description of the Heisenberg lattices in the regimes considered, suggesting
them as useful references for further inter-cluster correlations, which are
discussed in this work.

We developed a new advanced ultra-cold Dysprosium (Dy) apparatus, which
incorporates a quantum gas microscope (QGM) with a resolution of a quarter
micrometer. The QGM and the cooling and trapping regions are within the same
vacuum glass vessel assuring simple atom transport between them. We demonstrate
the essential experimental steps of laser and evaporative cooling, lattice
loading, transporting and precise positioning of a cloud of the bosonic isotope
164 Dy at the QGM focal plane. Preliminary basic characterization of the QGM
and future plans in enabling its full capacity are outlined. We also present a
feasible platform for simulating complex spin models of quantum magnetism, such
as XYZ model, by exploiting a set of closely spaced opposite parity levels in
Dy with a large magnetic and electric dipole moment. We isolate a degenerate
isospin-1/2 system, which possesses both magnetic and electric dipole-dipole
coupling, containing Ising, exchange and spin-orbit terms. The last gives rise
to a spin model with asymmetric tunable rates, dependable on the lattice
geometry.

<h3>Coherent Optical Spin Hall Transport for Spin-optronics at Room  Temperature</h3>

Spin or valley degrees of freedom in condensed matter have been proposed as
efficient information carriers towards next generation spintronics. It is
therefore crucial to develop effective strategies to generate and control spin
or valley-locked spin currents, e.g., by exploiting the spin Hall or valley
Hall effects. However, the scattering, and rapid dephasing of electrons pose
major challenges to achieve macroscopic coherent spin currents and realistic
spintronic or valleytronic devices, specifically at room temperature, where
strong thermal fluctuations could further obscure the spin flow. Exciton
polaritons in semiconductor microcavities being the quantum superposition of
excitons and photons, are believed to be promising platforms for spin-dependent
optoelectronic or, in short, spin-optronic devices. Long-range spin current
flows of exciton polaritons may be controlled through the optical spin Hall
effect. However, this effect could neither be unequivocally observed at room
temperature nor be exploited for realistic polariton spintronic devices due to
the presence of strong thermal fluctuations or large linear spin splittings.
Here, we report the observation of room temperature optical spin Hall effect of
exciton polaritons with the spin current flow over a distance as large as 60 um
in a hybrid organic-inorganic FAPbBr3 perovskite microcavity. We show direct
evidence of the long-range coherence at room temperature in the flow of exciton
polaritons, and the spin current carried by them. By harnessing the long-range
spin-Hall transport of exciton polaritons, we have demonstrated two novel room
temperature polaritonic devices, namely the NOT gate and the spin-polarized
beam splitter, advancing the frontier of room-temperature polaritonics in
perovskite microcavities.

<br>
<br>
We present an x-ray absorption spectroscopy study from the carbon $K$, sulfur
$K$, and sulfur $L_{2,3}$ edges of crystalline oligothiophenes of varying
length, i.e. bithiophene (2T), quaterthiophene (4T), and sexithiophene (6T),
performed from first principles by means of all-electron density-functional
theory and many-body perturbation theory. A comprehensive assignment of all
relevant spectral features is performed based on the electronic structure and
the character of the target conduction states. The inclusion of electron-hole
effects leads to significant redistribution of oscillator strengths and to
strongly bound excitons with binding energies ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 eV. When
going from 2T to 6T, exciton binding energies decrease by up to 1 eV, which we
attribute to the reduction of the average Coulomb attraction with increasing
oligomer length. These high values are significantly larger than their
counterparts in the optical excitations of these systems and indicative of
their localization on the respective molecules. For the same reason,
local-field effects which typically dominate the optical absorption of organic
crystals, turn out to play only a negligible role at all edges. We identify two
sets of carbon atoms, i.e. with or without sulfur bonding, which exhibit
distinct features at the C $K$-edge. The sulfur atoms, on the other hand, yield
similar contributions in the S, $K$, and $L_{2,3}$ edge spectra. Our results
show excellent agreement with available experimental data.

<h3>Asymmetries in triboelectric charging: generalizing mosaic models to  different-material samples and sliding contacts</h3>

<i>Galien Grosjean, Scott Waitukaitis</i>
<br>
<br>
Nominally identical materials exchange net electric charge during contact
through a mechanism that is still debated. `Mosaic models', in which surfaces
are presumed to consist of a random patchwork of microscopic donor/acceptor
sites, offer an appealing explanation for this phenomenon. However, recent
experiments have shown that global differences persist even between
same-material samples, which the standard mosaic framework does not account
for. Here, we expand the mosaic framework by incorporating global differences
in the densities of donor/acceptor sites. We develop an analytical model,
backed by numerical simulations, that smoothly connects the global and
deterministic charge transfer of different materials to the local and
stochastic mosaic picture normally associated with identical materials. Going
further, we extend our model to explain the effect of contact asymmetries
during sliding, providing a plausible explanation for reversal of charging sign
that has been observed experimentally.

<br>
<br>
We show that rhombohedral four-layer graphene (4LG) nearly aligned with a
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate often develops nearly flat isolated low
energy bands with non-zero valley Chern numbers. The bandwidths of the isolated
flatbands are controllable through an electric field and twist angle, becoming
as narrow as $\sim10~$meV for interlayer potential differences between top and
bottom layers of $|\Delta|\approx 10\sim15~$meV and $\theta \sim 0.5^{\circ}$
at the graphene and boron nitride interface. The local density of states (LDOS)
analysis shows that the nearly flat band states are associated to the non-dimer
low energy sublattice sites at the top or bottom graphene layers and their
degree of localization in the moire superlattice is strongly gate tunable,
exhibiting at times large delocalization despite of the narrow bandwidth. We
verified that the first valence bands' valley Chern numbers are
$C^{\nu=\pm1}_{V1} = \pm n$, proportional to layer number for $n$LG/BN systems
up to $n = 8$ rhombohedral multilayers.

Hard and superhard materials are critical components in numerous industrial
applications required for sustainable development. However, discovering new
materials with high hardness is challenging, because hardness is a complex and
multiscale property with a non-trivial connection to atomic properties of the
material. Here, we present a low-dimensional physical descriptor for Vickers
hardness derived from symbolic-regression artificial intelligence approach to
data analysis. The descriptor is a mathematical combination of materials'
properties that can be much easier evaluated than hardness itself via the
atomistic simulations and it is therefore suitable for a high-throughput
screening. The developed artificial intelligence model was trained on the
experimental values of hardness and then high-throughput screening were
performed among 635 compounds including binary, ternary, and quaternary
transition-metal borides, carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, carboborides, and
boronitrides to find the optimal superhard material. The proposed descriptor is
an analytic formula, which is physically interpretable, allowing us to get an
insight into the multiscale relationship between atomic structure (i.e., micro)
and hardness (i.e., macro). In details, we have found that the hardness is
proportional to the Voigt-averaged bulk modulus and inversely proportional to
the Poisson's ratio and Reuss-averaged shear modulus. Results of
high-throughput search showed the possible way of tuning hardness of existing
materials by making mixtures with harder, but metastable structures (e.g.,
metastable VN, TaN, ReN$_2$, Cr$_3$N$_4$, and ZrB$_6$ possess high hardness).

<br>
<br>
Local diffusivity of a protein depends crucially on the conformation, and the
conformational fluctuations are often non-Markovian. Here, we investigate the
Langevin equation with non-Markovian fluctuating diffusivity, where the
fluctuating diffusivity is modeled by a generalized Langevin equation under a
double-well potential. We find that non-Markovian fluctuating diffusivity
affect the global diffusivity, i.e., the diffusion coefficient obtained by the
long-time trajectories when the memory kernel in the generalized Langevin
equation is a power-law form. On the other hand, the diffusion coefficient does
not change when the memory kernel is exponential. We show that these
non-Markovian effects are the consequences of an everlasting effect of the
initial condition on the stationary distribution in the generalized Langevin
equation under a double-well potential due to long-term memory.

Liquid crystal skyrmions are topologically protected spatially localized
distortions of the director field which are fascinating from both fundamental
mathematics and applied physics points of view. Skyrmions are realized in
experimental setups which are identical to those used in display technology.
This opens exciting opportunities for designing advanced electro-optical
applications. Skyrmions exhibits particle-like properties including
translational motion in time periodic electric fields. Despite a large volume
of experimental results on the skyrmion collective behaviour, the theoretical
understanding of their effective interactions and emerging dynamics is rather
limited due to computational heaviness of numerical models based upon fine
grained Frank-Oseen or Landau-de Gennes continuum approaches. Here, we develop
a coarse grained model of the skyrmion dynamics. The model reveals the
underpinning physical mechanism of the skyrmion motion driven by pulse width
modulated electric fields. The mechanism is based upon the complex dynamics of
the width of the twist wall around the skyrmion's core. The width evolves in a
non-reciprocal way within each on and off states of the field, resulting in a
net displacement of the skyrmion. We analyse in details the average skyrmion
velocity as a function of the frequency and strength of the field as well as
its duty cycle. The model predictions agrees qualitatively with the results of
experiments and full numerical minimization of the fine grained models. Our
results provide insights into the conditions necessary to observe velocity
reversal as a function of the field parameters.

Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown an incredible rise in efficiency,
reaching as high as 25.7%, which now competes with traditional photovoltaic
technologies. Herein, we excluded CsX and RbX, the most commonly used cations
to stabilize FAPbI3, from the bulk of perovskite thin films and applied them on
the surface, as passivation agents. Extensive device optimization led to a
power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.1% with a high fill factor (FF) of
82.2% upon passivation with CsI. We investigated in-depth the effect of CsI
passivation on structural and optoelectronic properties using X-ray diffraction
(XRD), angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS), Kelvin Probe
Force (KPFM) microscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL),
photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and electroabsorption spectroscopy
(TREAS). Furthermore, passivated devices exhibit enhanced operational
stability, with optimized passivation with CsI leading to a retention of ~90%
of initial PCE under 1 Sun illumination with maximum power point tracking for

<br>
<br>
Defects, i.e. inhomogeneities of the underlying lattice, are ubiquitous in
magnetic materials and can have a crucial impact on their applicability in
spintronic devices. For magnetic skyrmions, localized and topologically
non-trivial spin textures, they give rise to a spatially inhomogeneous energy
landscape and can lead to pinning, resulting in an exponentially increased
dwell time at certain positions and typically a strongly reduced mobility.
Using atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we reveal that under certain
conditions defects can instead enhance thermal diffusion of ferromagnetic
skyrmions. By comparing with results for the diffusion of antiferromagnetic
skyrmions and using a quasi-particle description based on the Thiele equation,
we demonstrate that this surprising finding can be traced back to the partial
lifting of the impact of the topologigal gyrocoupling, which governs the
dynamics of ferromagnetic skyrmions in the absence of defects.

Ferroelectricity in sputtered undoped-HfO$_2$ is attractive for composition
control for low power and non-volatile memory and logic applications. Unlike
doped HfO$_2$, evolution of ferroelectricity with annealing and film thickness
effect in sputter deposited undoped HfO$_2$ on Si is not yet reported. In
present study, we have demonstrated the impact of post metallization annealing
temperature and film thickness on ferroelectric properties in dopant-free
sputtered HfO$_2$ on Si-substrate. A rich correlation of polarization with
phase, lattice constant, and crystallite size and interface reaction is
observed. First, anneal temperature shows o-phase saturation beyond 600 oC
followed by interface reaction beyond 700 oC to show an optimal temperature
window on 600-700 oC. Second, thickness study at the optimal temperature window
shows an alluring o-phase crystallite scaling with thickness till a critical
thickness of 20 nm indicating that the films are completely o-phase. However,
the lattice constants (volume) are high in the 15-20 nm thickness range which
correlates with the enhanced value of 2Pr. Beyond 20 nm, crystallite scaling
with thickness saturates with the correlated appearance of m-phase and
reduction in 2Pr. The optimal thickness-temperature window range of 15-20 nm
films annealed at 600-700 oC show 2Pr of ~35.5 micro-C/cm$^2$ is comparable to
state-of-the-art. The robust wakeup-free endurance of ~$10^$8 cycles showcased
in the promising temperature-thickness window has been identified
systematically for non-volatile memory applications.

Designing a protocol to efficiently drive a stochastic system is an active
field of research. Here we extend such control theory to an active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle (AOUP) in a bistable potential, driven by a
harmonic trap. We find that protocols designed to minimize the excess work (up
to linear-response) perform better than naive protocols with constant velocity
for a wide range of protocol durations.

We construct a general theoretical framework for describing curvature-induced
spin-orbit interactions on the basis of group theory. Our theory can
systematically determine the emergence of spin splitting in the band structure
according to symmetry in the wavenumber space and the bending direction of the
material. As illustrative examples, we derive the curvature-induced spin-orbit
coupling for carbon and silicon nanotubes. Our theory offers a strategy for
designing valley-contrasting spin-orbit coupled materials by tuning their
curvatures.

The fission of a string connecting two charges is one of the most astounding
phenomena in confining gauge theories. The dynamics of this process has been
the subject of recent intensive studies, in which plenty of numerical results
suggest the following dichotomy: the confining string can decay relatively fast
or persist up to extremely long times. Here, we put forward a dynamical
localization transition as the mechanism underlying this dichotomy. To this
end, we derive an effective string breaking description in the light-meson
sector of a confined spin chain and show that the problem can be regarded as a
dynamical localization transition in Fock space. Fast and suppressed string
breaking dynamics are identified with delocalized and localized behavior,
respectively. We then provide a further reduction of the dynamical string
breaking problem onto a quantum impurity model, where the string is represented
as an "impurity" immersed in a meson bath. It is shown that this
phenomenological model features a localization-delocalization transition,
giving a general and simple physical basis to understand the qualitatively
distinct string breaking regimes. These findings are directly relevant for a
wider class of confining lattice models in one and higher dimensions and could
be realized on present-day Rydberg quantum simulators.

We study the direct laser drive of infrared-active phonons that are
quadratically coupled to a spinless fermion chain. Feedback is incorporated by
phonon dressing of the electronic dispersion, which enables effective
non-linearities in the phonon dynamics. We uncover a first-order phase
transition in the phononic steady state in which hysteretic effects allow
either large or small phonon occupation depending on the drive protocol. We
discuss the implications of these findings for probing phase transitions in
real driven materials.

It is widely known that antiferromagnets (AFMs) display a high frequency
response in the terahertz (THz) range, which opens up the possibility for
ultrafast control of their magnetization for next generation data storage and
processing applications. However, because the magnetization of the different
sublattices cancel, their state is notoriously difficult to read. One way to
overcome this is to couple AFMs to ferromagnets - whose state is trivially read
via magneto-resistance sensors. Here we present conditions, using theoretical
modelling, that it is possible to switch the magnetization of an AFM/FM bilayer
using THz frequency pulses with moderate field amplitude and short durations,
achievable in experiments. Consistent switching is observed in the phase
diagrams for an order of magnitude increase in the interface coupling and a
tripling in the thickness of the FM layer. We demonstrate a range of reversal
paths that arise due to the combination of precession in the materials and the
THz-induced fields. Our analysis demonstrates that the AFM drives the switching
and results in a much higher frequency dynamics in the FM due to the exchange
coupling at the interface. The switching is shown to be robust over a broad
range of temperatures relevant for device applications.

<h3>Complex Memory Formation in Frictional Granular Media</h3>

Using numerical simulations it is shown that a jammed, random pack of soft
frictional grains can store an arbitrary waveform that is applied as a small
time-dependent shear while the system is slowly compressed. When the system is
decompressed at a later time, an approximation of the input waveform is
recalled in time-reversed order as shear stresses on the system boundaries.
This effect depends on friction between the grains, and is independent of some
aspects of the friction model. This type of memory could potentially be
observable in other types of random media that form internal contacts when
compressed.

As spin-based quantum processors grow in size and complexity, maintaining
high fidelities and minimizing crosstalk will be essential for the successful
implementation of quantum algorithms and error-correction protocols. In
particular, recent experiments have highlighted pernicious transient qubit
frequency shifts associated with microwave qubit driving. Workarounds for small
devices, including prepulsing with an off-resonant microwave burst to bring a
device to a steady-state, wait times prior to measurement, and qubit-specific
calibrations all bode ill for device scalability. Here, we make substantial
progress in understanding and overcoming this effect. We report a surprising
non-monotonic relation between mixing chamber temperature and spin Larmor
frequency which is consistent with observed frequency shifts induced by
microwave and baseband control signals. We find that purposefully operating the
device at 200 mK greatly suppresses the adverse heating effect while not
compromising qubit coherence or single-qubit fidelity benchmarks. Furthermore,
systematic non-Markovian crosstalk is greatly reduced. Our results provide a
straightforward means of improving the quality of multi-spin control while
simplifying calibration procedures for future spin-based quantum processors.

The optical properties of liquid crystals serve as the basis for display,
diagnostic, and sensing technologies. Such properties are generally controlled
by relying on electric fields. In this work, we investigate the effects of
microfluidic flows and acoustic fields on the molecular orientation and the
corresponding optical response of nematic liquid crystals. Several previously
unknown structures are identified, which are rationalized in terms of a state
diagram as a function of the strengths of the flow and the acoustic field. The
new structures are interpreted by relying on calculations with a free energy
functional expressed in terms of the tensorial order parameter, using continuum
theory simulations in the Landau-de Gennes framework. Taken together, the
findings presented here offer promise for the development of new systems based
on combinations of sound, flow, and confinement.
