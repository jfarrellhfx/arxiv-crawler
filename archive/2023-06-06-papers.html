<h3>Disordered quantum critical fixed points from holography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03130" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03130</a>

<i>Xiaoyang Huang, Subir Sachdev, Andrew Lucas</i>
<br>
<br>
Using holographic duality, we present an analytically controlled theory of
quantum critical points without quasiparticles, at finite disorder and finite
charge density. These fixed points are obtained by perturbing a disorder-free
quantum critical point with weakly Harris-relevant disorder. We analyze these
fixed points both using field theoretic arguments, and by solving the bulk
equations of motion in holography. We calculate the critical exponents of the
IR theory, together with thermoelectric transport coefficients. Our predictions
for the critical exponents of the disordered fixed point are consistent with
previous work, both in holographic and non-holograpic models.

We formulate the hydrodynamics of active columnar phases, with
two-dimensional translational order in the plane perpendicular to the columns
and no elastic restoring force for relative sliding of the columns, using the
general formalism of an active model H$^*$. Our predictions include:
two-dimensional odd elasticity coming from three-dimensional plasmon-like
oscillations of the columns in chiral polar phases with a frequency that is
independent of wavenumber and non-analytic; a buckling instability coming from
the generic force-dipole active stress analogous to the mechanical
Helfrich-Hurault instability in passive materials; the selection of helical
column undulations by apolar chiral activity.

<h3>Thermalization of Non-Fermi Liquid Electron-Phonon Systems: Hydrodynamic  Relaxation of the Yukawa-SYK Model</h3>

We study thermalization dynamics in a fermion-phonon variant of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to an external cold thermal bath of harmonic
oscillators. We find that quantum critical fermions thermalize more efficiently
than phonons, in sharp contrast to the behavior in the Fermi liquid regime. In
addition, after a short prethermal stage, the system acquires a quasi-thermal
distribution given by a time-dependent effective temperature, reminiscent of
"hydrodynamic" relaxation. All physical observables relax at the same rate
which scales with the final temperature through an exponent that depends
universally on the low energy spectrum of the system and the bath. Such
relaxation rate is derived using a hydrodynamic approximation in full agreement
with the numerical solution of a set quantum kinetic equations derived from the
Keldysh formalism for non-equilibrium Green's functions. Our results suggest
the applicability of the hydrodynamic picture in the description of the late
time dynamics of open quantum systems despite the absence of conserved
quantities in regimes dominated by conserving collisions.

<h3>The Effect of Ionic Spin on Multiferroic of Orthorhombic Perovskite</h3>

<br>
<br>
To investigate the influence of ion spin on the coupling between
ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in type II multiferroic perovskite, we
prepared the multiferroic perovskite Er0.9La0.1Cr0.8Fe0.2O3 (ELCFO) using the
sol-gel method, and explored the macroscopic magnetic properties of ELCFO
through M\"ossbauer spectrum and magnetic testing. The thermal magnetic curve
was analyzed to examine the state and change of each ionic spin in the ELCFO
system at different temperature ranges, and the role of ionic spin in the
coupling between ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity was investigated. This
study provides a theoretical basis for further research on multiferroic
perovskites and has practical implications.

<h3>Calculation of Special Spin Behavior of Dy3+ in DyFe1-xCrxO3 System by  Molecular Field Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03094</a>
<br>
<i>Kaiyang Gao, Kexuan Zhou, Jiyu Shen, Zeyi Lu, Chenying Gong, Zhongjin Wu, Ke Shi, Jing Guo, Zhaoyi Wang, Min Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, the sol-gel method synthesized the magnetic measurement and
analysis of single-phase polycrystalline perovskite DyFe1-xCrxO3 (DFCO). The
experimental data were fitted and calculated by a four-sublattice molecular
field model. Unlike previous studies, we found that in DyFe1-xCrxO3, the spin
of the A-site rare earth ion Dy3+ also changed simultaneously with the spin
reorientation of the Fe3+/Cr3+ ions. The effective spin is defined as the
projection of the A site's total spin on the B site's spin plane, and the curve
of temperature changes is obtained after fitting. With this theory, a very
accurate thermomagnetic curve is obtained by fitting. This is convincing and,
at the same time, provides a reference for the development of spintronic
devices in the future.

<h3>High-throughput search for triplet point defects with narrow emission  lines in 2D materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
We employ a first-principles computational workflow to screen for optically
accessible, high-spin point defects in wide band gap two-dimensional (2D)
crystals. Starting from an initial set of 5388 point defects, comprising both
intrinsic and extrinsic, single and double defects in ten previously
synthesised 2D host materials, we identify 596 defects with a triplet ground
state. For these defects, we calculate the defect formation energy, the
hyperfine (HF) coupling, and the zero-field splitting (ZFS) tensors. For 39
triplet transitions exhibiting particularly low Huang-Rhys factors, we
calculate the full photo-luminescence (PL) spectrum. Our approach reveals many
new spin defects with narrow PL line shapes and emission frequencies covering a
broad spectral range. Most of the defects are hosted in hexagonal BN, which we
ascribe to its high stiffness, but some are also found in MgI2, MoS2, MgBr2 and
CaI2. As specific examples, we propose the defects vSMoS0 and NiSMoS0 in MoS2
as interesting candidates with potential applications to magnetic field sensors
and quantum information technology. All the data will be made available in the
open access database QPOD.

Understanding the role of metal and oxygen in the redox process of layered 3d
transition metal oxides is crucial to build high density and stable next
generation Li-ion batteries. We combine hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
and ab-initio-based cluster model simulations to study the electronic structure
of prototypical end-members LiCoO2 and CoO2. The role of cobalt and oxygen in
the redox process is analyzed by optimizing the values of d-d electron
repulsion and ligand-metal p-d charge transfer to the Co 2p spectra. We clarify
the nature of oxidized cobalt ions by highlighting the transition from positive
to negative ligand-to-metal charge transfer upon Li+ de-intercalation.

<h3>CrystalGPT: Enhancing system-to-system transferability in  crystallization prediction and control using time-series-transformers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03099</a>
<br>
<i>Niranjan Sitapure, Joseph S. Kwon</i>
<br>
<br>
For prediction and real-time control tasks, machine-learning (ML)-based
digital twins are frequently employed. However, while these models are
typically accurate, they are custom-designed for individual systems, making
system-to-system (S2S) transferability difficult. This occurs even when
substantial similarities exist in the process dynamics across different
chemical systems. To address this challenge, we developed a novel
time-series-transformer (TST) framework that exploits the powerful transfer
learning capabilities inherent in transformer algorithms. This was demonstrated
using readily available process data obtained from different crystallizers
operating under various operational scenarios. Using this extensive dataset, we
trained a TST model (CrystalGPT) to exhibit remarkable S2S transferability not
only across all pre-established systems, but also to an unencountered system.
CrystalGPT achieved a cumulative error across all systems, which is eight times
superior to that of existing ML models. Additionally, we coupled CrystalGPT
with a predictive controller to reduce the variance in setpoint tracking to
just 1%.

<h3>Scaling theory of intrinsic Kondo and Hund's rule interactions in  magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03121" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03121</a>
<br>
<i>Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent studies of intrinsic local moments and Kondo-driven
phases in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, we investigate the
renormalization of Kondo coupling ($J_K$) and the competing Hund's rule
interaction ($J$) in the low-energy limit. Specifically, we consider a
surrogate single-impurity generalized Kondo model and employ the poor man's
scaling approach. The scale-dependent $J_K$ and $J$ are derived analytically
within the one-loop poor man's scaling approach, and the Kondo temperature
($T_K$) and the characteristic Hund's rule coupling ($J^*$, defined by the
renormalized value of $J$ at some small finite energy scale) are estimated over
a wide range of filling factors. We find that $T_K$ depends strongly on the
filling factors as well as the value of $J_K$. Slightly doping away from
integer fillings and/or increasing $J_K$ may substantially enhance $T_K$ in the
parameter regime relevant to experiments. $J^*$ is always reduced from the bare
value of $J$, but the filling factor dependence is not as significant as it is
for $T_K$. Our results suggest that it is essential to incorporate the
renormalization of $J_K$ and $J$ in the many-body calculations, and Kondo
screening should occur for a wide range of fractional fillings in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene, implying the existence of Kondo-driven correlated
metallic phases. We also point out that the observation of distinct phases at
integer fillings in different samples may be due to the variation of $J_K$ in
addition to disorder and strain in the experiments.

<br>
<br>
By directly altering microscopic interactions, pressure provides a powerful
tuning knob for the exploration of condensed phases and geophysical phenomena.
The megabar regime represents an exciting frontier, where recent discoveries
include novel high-temperature superconductors, as well as structural and
valence phase transitions. However, at such high pressures, many conventional
measurement techniques fail. Here, we demonstrate the ability to perform local
magnetometry inside of a diamond anvil cell with sub-micron spatial resolution
at megabar pressures. Our approach utilizes a shallow layer of Nitrogen-Vacancy
(NV) color centers implanted directly within the anvil; crucially, we choose a
crystal cut compatible with the intrinsic symmetries of the NV center to enable
functionality at megabar pressures. We apply our technique to characterize a
recently discovered hydride superconductor, CeH$_9$. By performing simultaneous
magnetometry and electrical transport measurements, we observe the dual
signatures of superconductivity: local diamagnetism characteristic of the
Meissner effect and a sharp drop of the resistance to near zero. By locally
mapping the Meissner effect and flux trapping, we directly image the geometry
of superconducting regions, revealing significant inhomogeneities at the micron
scale. Our work brings quantum sensing to the megabar frontier and enables the
closed loop optimization of superhydride materials synthesis.

As part of a chapter for a book titled "50 years of the renormalization
group", dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher, edited by Amnon Aharony,
Ora Entin-Wohlman, David Huse, and Leo Radzihovsky, I review a class of novel
ordered states of "critical matter", that exhibit strongly fluctuating
universal power-law orders, controlled by an infra-red attractive, non-Gaussian
fixed point. I will illustrate how RG methods pioneered by Wilson and Fisher
can be used to deduce critical phenomenology of such critical phases,
resembling that of a critical point of second order phase transitions, but
requiring no fine tuning.

<h3>Machine learning feature discovery of spinon Fermi surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03143" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03143</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin Zhang, Shi Feng, Yuri D. Lensky, Nandini Trivedi, Eun-Ah Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
With rapid progress in simulation of strongly interacting quantum
Hamiltonians, the challenge in characterizing unknown phases becomes a
bottleneck for scientific progress. We demonstrate that a Quantum-Classical
hybrid approach (QuCl) of mining the projective snapshots with interpretable
classical machine learning, can unveil new signatures of seemingly featureless
quantum states. The Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice with
bond-dependent frustrated interactions presents an ideal system to test QuCl.
The model hosts a wealth of quantum spin liquid states: gapped and gapless
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids, and a chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in a small
external magnetic field. Recently, various simulations have found a new
intermediate gapless phase (IGP), sandwiched between the CSL and a partially
polarized phase, launching a debate over its elusive nature. We reveal
signatures of phases in the model by contrasting two phases pairwise using an
interpretable neural network, the correlator convolutional neural network
(CCNN). We train the CCNN with a labeled collection of sampled projective
measurements and reveal signatures of each phase through regularization path
analysis. We show that QuCl reproduces known features of established spin
liquid phases and ordered phases. Most significantly, we identify a signature
motif of the field-induced IGP in the spin channel perpendicular to the field
direction, which we interpret as a signature of Friedel oscillations of gapless
spinons forming a Fermi surface. Our predictions can guide future experimental
searches for $U(1)$ spin liquids.

<h3>Extreme Value Statistics and Arcsine Laws of Brownian Motion in the  Presence of a Permeable Barrier Barrier</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03157" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03157</a>
<br>
<i>Toby Kay, Luca Giuggioli</i>
<br>
<br>
The Arcsine laws of Brownian motion are a collection of results describing
three different statistical quantities of one-dimensional Brownian motion: the
time at which the process reaches its maximum position, the total time the
process spends in the positive half-space and the time at which the process
crosses the origin for the last time. Remarkably the cumulative probabilities
of these three observables all follows the same distribution, the Arcsine
distribution. But in real systems, space is often heterogeneous, and these laws
are likely to hold no longer. In this paper we explore such a scenario and
study how the presence of a spatial heterogeneity alters these Arcsine laws.
Specifically we consider the case of a thin permeable barrier, which is often
employed to represent diffusion impeding heterogeneities in physical and
biological systems such as multilayer electrodes, electrical gap junctions,
cell membranes and fragmentation in the landscape for dispersing animals. Using
the Feynman-Kac formalism and path decomposition techniques we are able to find
the exact time-dependence of the probability distribution of the three
statistical quantities of interest. We show that a permeable barrier has a
large impact on these distributions at short times, but this impact is less
influential as time becomes long. In particular, the presence of a barrier
means that the three distributions are no longer identical with symmetry about
their means being broken. We also study a closely related statistical quantity,
namely, the distribution of the maximum displacement of a Brownian particle and
show that it deviates significantly from the usual half-Gaussian form.

<h3>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Limits to the Precision of Loosely Coupled  Molecular Motors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03182</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Albaugh, Rueih-Sheng Fu, Geyao Gu, Todd R. Gingrich</i>
<br>
<br>
Molecular motors are nanoscale systems that convert chemical free energy to
directed motion or work. We use molecular simulation to examine a family of
catenane molecular motors and to analyze their performance compared to the
physical limit provided by thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). By
varying the pair potentials and designs of the catenane motors, we find that
the precision of the molecular motor currents can vary over orders of
magnitude, but that precision is always observed to be far lower than the TUR
limit. We further quantitatively rationalize the deviation from the TUR bound,
illustrating that we can anticipate the degree to which a motor fails to
saturate the TUR in terms of four physical parameters: the chemical potential
driving the motor, the rate of fuel decomposition, the coupling between fuel
decomposition and motor motion, and the rate of undriven motor motion. The
analysis suggests that, for the catenane motors to become appreciably more
efficient with respect to the TUR, it will be necessary to (i) make the fueling
reaction less exergonic and (ii) couple the consumption of fuel more tightly to
biased motion.

<h3>Light-induced half-quantized Hall effect and Axion insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03187</a>
<br>
<i>Fang Qin, Ching Hua Lee, Rui Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the half-quantized Hall
effect phase in a three-dimensional (3D) semi-magnetic topological insulator
[M. Mogi et al., Nature Physics 18, 390 (2022)], we propose a new scheme for
realizing the half-quantized Hall effect and Axion insulator in experimentally
mature 3D topological insulator heterostructures. Our approach involves
optically pumping and/or magnetically doping the topological insulator surface,
such as to break time reversal and gap out the Dirac cones. By toggling between
left and right circularly polarized optical pumping, the sign of the
half-integer Hall conductance from each of the surface Dirac cones can be
controlled, such as to yield half-quantized ($0+1/2$), Axion ($-1/2+1/2=0$) and
Chern ($1/2+1/2=1$) insulator phases. We substantiate our results based on
detailed band structure and Berry curvature numerics on the Floquet Hamiltonian
in the high-frequency limit. Our work showcases how new topological phases can
be obtained through mature experimental approaches such as magnetic layer
doping and circularly-polarized laser pumping, and opens up potential device
applications such as a polarization chirality-controlled topological
transistor.

<h3>A theoretical model for power generation via liquid crystal elastomers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03193" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03193</a>
<br>
<i>L. Angela Mihai</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the need for new materials and green energy production and
conversion processes, a class of mathematical models for liquid crystal
elastomers integrated within a theoretical charge pump electrical circuit is
considered. The charge pump generates higher voltage from a lower voltage
supplied by a battery and recharges the battery by harnessing the chemical and
mechanical properties of liquid crystal elastomers transitioning from the
nematic to isotropic phase when illuminated or heated. For the material
constitutive model, purely elastic and neoclassical-type strain energy
densities, applicable to a wide range of monodomain nematic elastomers, are
combined with a modified Maier-Saupe mean field model for photo-thermal
responses. By varying the model parameters of the elastic and neoclassical
terms, it is found that liquid crystal elastomers are more effective than
rubber when used as dielectric material within a charge pump capacitor.

<h3>A Generalizable TCAD Framework for Silicon FinFET Spin Qubit Devices  with Electrical Control</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03213</a>
<br>
<i>Qian Ding, Andreas V. Kuhlmann, Andreas Fuhrer, Andreas Schenk</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a TCAD-based simulation framework established for quantum dot spin
qubits in a silicon FinFET platform with all-electrical control of the spin
state. The framework works down to 1K and consists of a two-step simulation
chain, from definition of the quantum dot confinement potential with DC bias
voltages, to calculation of microwave response electric field at qubit
locations using small-signal AC analysis. An average field polarization vector
at each quantum dot is extracted via a post-processing step. We demonstrate
functionality of this approach by simulation of a recently reported two-qubit
device in the form of a 5-gate silicon FinFET. The impact of the number of
holes in each quantum dot on the MW response E-field polarization direction is
further investigated for this device. The framework is easily generalizable to
study future multi-qubit large-scale systems.

<h3>Electronic structure, orbital-selective behavior, and magnetic  tendencies in the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under  pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03231</a>
<br>
<i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recently reported high-temperature superconductivity in the
bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure, here we comprehensively study
this system using {\it ab initio} techniques. The Ni $3d$ orbitals have a large
bandwidth at ambient pressure, increasing by $\sim 22\%$ at 29.5 Gpa. Without
electronic interactions, the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals form a
bonding-antibonding molecular orbital state via the O $p_z$ inducing a ``hidden
dimer'' lattice in the LNO bilayers. The Fermi surface consists of two-electron
pockets with mixed $e_g$ orbitals and a hole pocket defined by the
$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, suggesting a Ni two-orbital minimum model. Different
from the infinite-layer nickelate, we obtained a large {\it interorbital}
hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states in LNO, caused by the
ligand ``bridge'' of in-plane O $p_x$ or $p_y$ orbitals connecting those two
orbitals, inducing $d-p$ $\sigma$-bonding characteristics. This interorbital
hopping leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram because of bond ferromagnetic
tendencies via the recently discussed ``half-empty'' mechanism.

<h3>Random sequential adsorption of aligned rectangles with two discrete  orientations: Finite-size scaling effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03259</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Petrone, Nikolai Lebovka, MichaÅ CieÅla</i>
<br>
<br>
We study saturated packings produced according to random sequential
adsorption (RSA) protocol built of identical rectangles deposited on a flat,
continuous plane. An aspect ratio of rectangles is defined as the
length-to-width ratio, $f=l/w$. The rectangles have a fixed unit area (i.e., $l
\times w=1$), and therefore, their shape is defined by the value of $f$
($l=\sqrt{f}$ and $w=1/\sqrt{f}$). The rectangles are allowed to align either
vertically or horizontally with equal probability. The particles are deposited
on a flat square substrate of side length $L$ (measured in units of particle
length, $L \in [20, 1000]$) and periodic boundary conditions are applied along
both directions. The finite-size scaling effects are characterized by a scaled
anisotropy defined as $\alpha = l/L = \sqrt{f}/L$. We showed that the
properties of such packings strongly depend on the value of aspect ratio $f$
and the most significant scaling effects are observed for relatively long
rectangles when $l\ge L/2$ (i.e. $\alpha \ge 0.5$). It is especially visible
for the mean packing fraction as a function of the scaled anisotropy $\alpha$.
The kinetics of packing growth for low to moderate rectangle anisotropy is to
be governed by $\ln t/t$ law, where $t$ is proportional to the number of RSA
iterations, which is the same as in the case of RSA of parallel squares. We
also analyzed global orientational ordering in such packings and properties of
domains consisting of a set of neighboring rectangles of the same orientation,
and the probability that such domain forms a percolation.

Due to their long-lived nature, vortex rings are highly promising for
non-contact transportation of colloidal microparticles. However, they are
complex structures, and their description using rigorous, closed-form
mathematical expressions is challenging, particularly in the presence of
strongly inhomogeneous colloidal suspensions. This study presents
straightforward analytical approximations that reveal the dynamics of vortex
rings transporting microparticles. Our results were validated using
comprehensive simulations and experimental measurements.

<br>
<br>
The development of patterned multi-quantum well heterostructures in
GaAs/AlGaAs waveguides has recently allowed to achieve exciton-polariton
condensation in a topologically protected bound state in the continuum (BIC).
Remarkably, condensation occurred above a saddle point of the polariton
dispersion. A rigorous analysis of the condensation phenomenon in these
systems, as well as the role of the BIC, is still missing. In the present
Letter we theoretically and experimentally fill this gap, by showing that
polariton confinement resulting from the negative effective mass and the
photonic energy gap in the dispersion play a key role in enhancing the
relaxation towards the condensed state. In fact, our results show that
low-threshold polariton condensation is achieved within the effective trap
created by the exciting laser spot regardless of whether the resulting confined
mode is long-lived (polariton BIC) or short-lived (lossy mode). In both cases,
the spatial quantization of the polariton condensate and the threshold
differences associated to the corresponding state lifetime are measured and
characterized. For a given negative mass, a slightly lower condensation
threshold from the polariton BIC mode is found and associated to its suppressed
radiative losses as compared to the lossy one.

<br>
<br>
Many variants of RNA, DNA, and even proteins can be considered semiflexible
polymers, where bending stiffness, as a type of energetic penalty, competes
with attractive van der Waals forces in structure formation processes. Here, we
systematically investigate the effect of the bending stiffness on ground-state
conformations of a generic coarse-grained model for semiflexible polymers. This
model possesses multiple transition barriers. Therefore, we employ advanced
generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo methods to search for the lowest-energy
conformations. As the formation of distinct versatile ground-state
conformations, including compact globules, rod-like bundles, and toroids,
strongly depends on the strength of the bending restraint, we also performed a
detailed analysis of contact and distance maps.

<h3>Ultrahigh electrostrain > 1% in lead-free piezoceramics: A critical  review</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03343</a>
<br>
<i>Gobinda Das Adhikary, Digivijay Narayan Singh, Getaw Abebe Tina, Gudeta Jafo Muleta, Rajeev Ranjan</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, a series of reports showing ultra-high electrostrain (> 1 %) have
appeared in several Pb-free piezoceramics. The ultrahigh electrostrain has been
attributed exclusively to the defect dipoles created in these systems. We
examine these claims based on another report arXiv:2208.07134 which
demonstrated that the measured electric field driven strain increased
dramatically simply by reducing the thickness of the ceramic discs. We prepared
some representative Pb-free compositions reported to exhibit ultrahigh strain
and performed electrostrain measurements. We found that these compositions do
not show ultrahigh electrostrain if the thickness of the discs is above 0.3 mm
(the disc diameters were in the range 10- 12 mm diameter). The ultrahigh strain
values were obtained when the thickness was below 0.3 mm. We compare the
electrostrain obtained from specimens designed to exhibit defect dipoles with
specimens that were not designed to have defect dipoles in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT)
and K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) -based lead-free systems and could obtain much higher
strain levels (4- 5 %) in the defect dipole free piezoceramics in the small
thickness regime. Our results do not favor the defect dipole theory as the
exclusive factor for causing ultrahigh strain in piezoceramics. A new approach
is called for to understand the phenomenon of ultrahigh electrostrain caused by
the thickness reduction of piezoceramic discs.

In stochastic thermodynamics, significant attention has been given to

Brownian particle subjected to a static magnetic field, providing insights
through the examination of the characteristic function, central moments, and

<br>
<br>
We study the plaquette valence bond solid phase in a XXZ type spin-1/2 model
in the kagome lattice. The low energy theory for this phase is a U(1) lattice
gauge theory on the honeycomb lattice. We find that there is an emergent 1-form
U(1) symmetry in low energy, and there is a mixed anomaly. We also show that
this 1-form symmetry constraints the longitudinal dynamical structure factor
and leads to the selection rule relating to the vanishing intensity along some
high symmetry momentum paths (e.g. $\Gamma-M$ path). We point out that this
emergent 1-form symmetry is robust against the translation symmetry preserving
UV perturbation, thus the selection rule will also apply to the model which is
obtained by perturbing the classical limit of our model.

<br>
<br>
Superconductivity in V-based kagome metals has recently raised great interest
as they exhibit the competing ground states associated with the flat bands and
topological electronic structures. Here we report the discovery of
superconductivity in Ta2V3.1Si0.9 with a superconducting transition temperature
Tc of 7.5 K, much higher than those in previously reported kagome metals at
ambient pressure. While the V ions form a two-dimensional breathing kagome
structure, the length difference between two different V-V bonds is just 0.04,
making it very close to the perfect kagome structure. Our results show that
Ta2V3.1Si0.9 is a moderate-coupled superconductor with a large upper critical
field that is close to the Pauli limit. DFT calculations give a
van-Hove-singularity band located at Fermi energy, which may explain the
relatively high Tc observed in this material.

<br>
Deviation from perfect conical dispersion in Dirac materials, such as the
presence of mass or tilting, enhances control and directionality of electronic
transport. To identify these signatures, we analyze the thermal derivative
spectra of optical reflectivity in doped massive tilted Dirac systems. The
density of states and chemical potential are determined as preliminary steps to
calculate the optical conductivity tensor at finite temperature using thermal
convolution. Changes in reflection caused by temperature variations enable
clear identification of critical frequencies in the optical response. By
measuring these spectral features in the thermoderivative spectrum, energy gaps
and band structure tilting can be determined. A comparison is presented between
the spectra of various low-energy Dirac Hamiltonians. Our findings suggest that
thermal difference spectroscopy holds promise as a valuable technique for
probing interband transitions of 2D Dirac fermions

<br>
<br>
A fundamental requirement for quantum technologies is the ability to
coherently control the interaction between electrons and photons. However, in
many scenarios involving the interaction between light and matter, the exchange
of linear or angular momentum between electrons and photons is not feasible, a
condition known as the dipole-approximation limit. An example of a case beyond
this limit that has remained experimentally elusive is when the interplay
between chiral electrons and vortex light is considered, where the orbital
angular momentum of light can be transferred to electrons. Here, we present a
novel mechanism for such an orbital angular momentum transfer from optical
vortex beams to electronic quantum Hall states. Specifically, we identify a
robust contribution to the radial photocurrent, in an annular graphene sample
within the quantum Hall regime, that depends on the vorticity of light. This
phenomenon can be interpreted as an optical pumping scheme, where the angular
momentum of photons is transferred to electrons, generating a radial current,
and the current's direction is determined by the light's vorticity. Our
findings offer fundamental insights into the optical probing and manipulation
of quantum coherence, with wide-ranging implications for advancing quantum
coherent optoelectronics.

<br>
<br>
Various superconducting lattices were simulated and can be treated as
lattices of superconducting atoms with preimposed symmetry in 1, 2 and 3
dimensions. Hybrid Schroedinger-Ginzburg-Landau approach is based on the fact
of the mathematical similarity of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) and Schroedinger
formalisms. Starting from Schroedinger approach by change of term V(x)-E with
term $\alpha(x)+\beta(x)|\psi(x)|^2$ we arrived at the Ginzburg-Landau
equation. In the presented relaxation algorithm we use one and two dimensional
ground energy solutions of Schroedinger equation and placed them as starting
trial solution for GL relaxation method. In consecutive steps we increase the
nonlinear term in the GL equation which results in achieving a stable approach
of solution of GL equation. The obtained numerical results and used methodology
form simulation platform bases for study of superconducting integrated
structures that can model various superconducting devices. In general, one can
model time-dependent geometry of superconducting structures.

We present the explicit expressions for the matrix product operator (MPO)

bond dimension of the MPO grows linearly with the locality of the charges. The
MPO has more simple form than the local charges themselves, and their Catalan
tree patterns naturally emerge from the matrix products. The MPO representation
of local conserved quantities is generalized to the integrable $\mathrm{SU}(N)$

We investigate the topological Hall effect (THE) in the monoaxial chiral
crystal GdPt$_2$B, a recently discovered compound that exhibits putative
helimagnetism below 87 K. The distinct THE was observed in GdPt2B in the
magnetically ordered state. The scaling relations for anomalous and topological
Hall conductivities differed from those of conventional models based on the
scattering process. We further demonstrate the clear scaling behavior of the
THE in a wide temperature range, which we attribute to the monoaxial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction under external magnetic fields
perpendicular to the screw axis. The THE induced by the monoaxial DM
interaction as well as the THE in a monoaxial chiral crystal of f-electron
system are demonstrated in this study.

Size- and shape- dependent unique properties of the metal halide perovskite
nanocrystals make them promising building blocks for constructing various
electronic and optoelectronic devices. These unique properties together with
their easy colloidal synthesis render them efficient nanoscale functional
components for multiple applications ranging from light emission devices to
energy conversion and storage devices. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) metal
halide perovskites in the form of nanosheets (NSs) or nanoplatelets (NPls) are
being intensively studied due to their promising 2D geometry which is more
compatible with the conventional electronic and optoelectronic device
structures where film-like components are employed. In particular, 2D
perovskites exhibit unique thickness-dependent properties due to the strong
quantum confinement effect, while enabling the bandgap tuning in a wide
spectral range. In this review the synthesis procedures of 2D perovskite
nanostructures will be summarized, while the application-related properties
together with the corresponding applications will be extensively discussed. In
addition, perovskite nanocrystals/2D material heterostructures will be reviewed
in detail. Finally, the wide application range of the 2D perovskite-based
structures developed to date, including pure perovskites and their
heterostructures, will be presented while the improved synergetic properties of
the multifunctional materials will be discussed in a comprehensive way.

<h3>Interplay between multi-spin and chiral spin interactions on triangular  lattice</h3>

<i>Li-Wei He, Jian-Xin Li</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ nearest-neighber Heisenberg model with
the four-site ring-exchange $J_4$ and chiral interaction $J_\chi$ on the
triangular lattice by using the variational Monte Carlo method. The $J_4$ term
induces the quadratic band touching (QBT) quantum spin liquid (QSL) with only a
$d+id$ spinon pairing (without hopping term), the nodal $d$-wave QSL and U(1)
QSL with a finite spinon Fermi surface progressively. The effect of the chiral
interaction $J_\chi$ can enrich the phase diagram with two interesting chiral
QSLs (topological orders) with the same quantized Chern number $\mathcal{C} =
\frac{1}{2}$ and ground-state degeneracy GSD = 2, namely the U(1) chiral spin
liquid (CSL) and Z$_2$ $d+id$-wave QSL. The nodal $d$-wave QSL is fragile and
will turn to the Z$_2$ $d+id$ QSL with any finite $J_\chi$ within our numerical
calculation. However, in the process from QBT to the Z$_2$ $d+id$ QSL with the
increase of $J_\chi$, an exotic crossover region is found. In this region, the
previous QBT state acquires a small hopping term so that it opens a small gap
at the otherwise band touching points, and leads to an energy minimum which is
energetically more favorable compared to another competitive local minimum from
the Z$_2$ $d+id$ QSL. We dub this state as the proximate QBT QSL and it gives
way to the Z$_2$ $d+id$ QSL eventually. Therefore, the cooperation of the $J_4$
and $J_\chi$ terms favors mostly the Z$_2$ $d+id$-wave QSL, so that this phase
occupies the largest region in the phase diagram.

<h3>Evolution of magnetic correlation in an inhomogeneous square lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
We explore the magnetic properties of a two-dimensional Hubbard model on an
inhomogeneous square lattice, which provides a platform for tuning the
bandwidth of the flat band. In its limit, this inhomogeneous square lattice
turns into a Lieb lattice, and it exhibits abundant properties due to the flat
band structure at the Fermi level. By using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo
simulation, we calculate the spin susceptibility, double occupancy,
magnetization, spin structure factor, and effective pairing interaction of the
system. It is found that the antiferromagnetic correlation is suppressed by the
inhomogeneous strength and that the ferromagnetic correlation is enhanced. Both
the antiferromagnetic correlation and ferromagnetic correlation are enhanced as
the interaction increases. It is also found that the effective $d$-wave pairing
interaction is suppressed by the increasing inhomogeneity. In addition, we also
study the thermodynamic properties of the inhomogeneous square lattice, and the
calculation of specific heat provide good support for our point. Our intensive
numerical results provide a rich magnetic phase diagram over both the
inhomogeneity and interaction.

<br>
<br>
We study the defect solutions of the Non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model
(NRCH). We find two kinds of defects, spirals with unit magnitude topological
charge, and topologically neutral targets. These defects generate radially
outward travelling waves and thus break the parity and time-reversal symmetry.
For a given strength of non-reciprocity, spirals and targets with unique
asymptotic wavenumber and amplitude are selected. We use large-scale
simulations to show that at low non-reciprocity $\alpha$, a quenched disordered
state evolves into quasi-stationary spiral networks. With increasing $\alpha$,
we observe networks composed primarily of targets. Beyond a critical threshold
$\alpha_c$, a disorder-order transition to from defect networks to travelling
waves emerges. The transition is marked by a sharp rise in the global polar
order.

<i>Giulio Biroli, Marc MÃ©zard</i>
<br>
<br>
Generative models based on diffusion have become the state of the art in the
last few years, notably for image generation. Here, we analyse them in the
high-dimensional limit, where data are formed by a very large number of
variables. We use methods from statistical physics and focus on two
well-controlled high-dimensional cases: a Gaussian model and the Curie-Weiss
model of ferromagnetism. In the latter case, we highlight the mechanism of
symmetry breaking in the inverse diffusion, and point out that, in order to
reconstruct the relative asymmetry of the two low-temperature states, and thus
to obtain the correct probability weights, one needs a database with a number
of points much larger than the dimension of each data point. We characterize
the scaling laws in the number of data and in the number of dimensions for an
efficient generation.

Rare-earth delafossite compounds, ARCh$_2$ (A = alkali or monovalent ion, R =
rare earth, Ch = chalcogen), have been proposed for a range of novel quantum
phenomena. Particularly, the Tm series, ATmCh$_2$, featuring Tm ions on a
triangular lattice, serves as a representative group of compounds to illustrate
the interplay and competition between spin-orbit coupling, crystal fields, and
exchange couplings in the presence of geometric frustration. Here we report the
thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering studies on the newly discovered
triangular-lattice magnet KTmSe$_2$. Both heat capacity and neutron diffraction
reveal the absence of long-range magnetic order. Magnetic susceptibility shows
strong Ising-like interactions with antiferromagnetic correlations.
Furthermore, inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal a branch of
dispersive crystal field excitations. To analyze these observations, we employ
both the transverse field Ising model and the full crystal field scheme, along
with exchange interactions. Our results suggest a strong competition between
spin exchange interactions and crystal field effects. This work is expected to
offer a valuable framework for understanding low-temperature magnetism in
KTmSe$_2$ and similar materials.

<br>
<br>
Due to their aperiodic nature, quasicrystals are one of the least understood
phases in statistical physics. One significant complication they present in
comparison to their periodic counterparts is the fact that any quasicrystal can
be realized as an exponentially large number of different tilings, resulting in
a significant contribution to the quasicrystal entropy. Here, we use
free-energy calculations to demonstrate that it is this configurational entropy
which stabilizes a dodecagonal quasicrystal in a binary mixture of hard spheres
on a plane. Our calculations also allow us to quantitatively confirm that in
this system all tiling realizations are essentially equally likely, with
free-energy differences less than 0.0001$k_BT$ per particle -- an observation
that could be the related to the observation of only random tilings in soft
matter quasicrystals. Owing to the simplicity of the model and its available
counterparts in colloidal experiments, we believe that this system is a
excellent candidate to achieve the long-awaited quasicrystal self-assembly on
the micron scale.

<h3>Slidephononics: Tailoring Thermal Transport Properties by van der Waals  Sliding</h3>

<i>Linfeng Yu, Chen Shen*, Guangzhao Qin, Hongbin Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
By interlayer sliding in van der Waals (vdW) materials, the switching
electric polarization of ultrathin ferroelectric materials leads to the widely
studied slidetronics. In this work, we report that such sliding can further
tailor anharmonic effects and hence thermal transport properties due to the
changed intrinsic coupling between atomic layers. And we propose an
unprecedented concept dubbed as slidephononics, where the phonons and
associated physical properties can be controlled by varying the intrinsic
stacking configurations of slidetronic vdW materials. Based on the
state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the
thermal conductivity of boron nitride (BN) bilayers can be significantly
modulated (by up to four times) along the sliding pathways. Detailed analysis
reveals that the variation of thermal conductivities can be attributed to the
tunable (de-)coupling of the out-of-plane acoustic phonon branches with the
other phonon modes, which is induced by the interlayer charge transfer. Such
strongly modulated thermal conductivity via interlayer sliding in vdW materials
paves the way to engineer thermal management materials in emerging vdW
electronic devices, which would shed light on future studies of slidephononics.

We propose a paradigm of multiplexed dispersive qubit measurement performed
while the qubits dephase. A Laplace transformation of the time-dependent cavity
response allows to separate contributions from multiple qubits coupled to the
same resonator mode, thus allowing for simultaneous single-shot read out. With
realistic parameters for silicon spin qubits we find a competitive readout
fidelity, while the measurement time compares favourably to conventional
dispersive readout. We extend the multiplexed readout method to quantum
non-demolition measurements using auxiliary qubits.

We analyzed the X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) of carbon 1s states in
graphene and oxygen-intercalated graphene grown on SiC(0001) using Bayesian
spectroscopy. To realize highly accurate spectral decomposition of the XPS
spectra, we proposed a framework for discovering physical constraints from the
absence of prior quantified physical knowledge, in which we designed the prior
probabilities based on the found constraints and the physically required
conditions. This suppresses the exchange of peak components during replica
exchange Monte Carlo iterations and makes possible to decompose XPS in the case
where a reliable structure model or a presumable number of components is not
known. As a result, we have successfully decomposed XPS of one monolayer (1ML),
two monolayers (2ML), and quasi-freestanding 2ML (qfs-2ML) graphene samples
deposited on SiC substrates with the meV order precision of the binding energy,
in which the posterior probability distributions of the binding energies were
obtained distinguishably between the different components of buffer layer even

Equilibrium atomic configuration and electronic structure of the (001)
surface of IV-VI semiconductors PbTe, PbSe, SnTe and SnSe, is studied using the
density functional theory (DFT) methods. At surfaces of all those compounds,
the displacements of ions from their perfect lattice sites reveal two features
characteristic of the rock salt crystals. First, the ionic displacements occur
only along the direction perpendicular to the surface, and they exhibit the
rumpling effect, i.e., the vertical shifts of cations and anions differ.
Second, the interlayer spacing of the first few monolayers at the surface
oscillates. Our results are in good agreement with the previous X-ray
experimental data and theoretical results where available. They also are
consistent with the presence of two {110} mirror planes at the (001) surface of
the rock salt. One the other hand, experiments preformed for the topological
Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ Se alloy indicate breaking of the mirror symmetry due to a
large 0.3 {\AA} relative displacement of the cation and anion sublattices at
the surface, which induces the opening of the gap of the Dirac cones. Our
results for Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se including the simulated STM images, are in
contradiction with these findings, since surface reconstructions with broken
symmetry are never the ground state configurations. The impact of the
theoretically determined surface configurations and of the chemical disorder on
the surface states is analyzed.

<br>
<br>
We performed spin-, time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy (STARPES) of excitons prepared by photoexcitation of
inversion-symmetric 2H-WSe$_2$ with circularly polarized light. The very short
probing depth of XUV photoemission permits selective measurement of
photoelectrons originating from the top-most WSe$_2$ layer, allowing for direct
measurement of hidden spin polarization of bright and momentum-forbidden dark
excitons. Our results reveal efficient chiroptical control of bright excitons'
hidden spin polarization. Following optical photoexcitation, intervalley
scattering between nonequivalent K-K' valleys leads to a decay of bright
excitons' hidden spin polarization. Conversely, the ultrafast formation of
momentum-forbidden dark excitons acts as a local spin polarization reservoir,
which could be used for spin injection in van der Waals heterostructures
involving multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

In recent years, Rydberg excitations in atomic quantum gases have become a
successful platform to explore quantum impurity problems. A single impurity
immersed in a Fermi gas leads to the formation of a polaron, a quasiparticle
consisting of the impurity being dressed by the surrounding medium. With a
radius of about the Fermi wavelength, the density profile of a polaron cannot
be explored using in-situ optical imaging techniques. In this work, we propose
a new experimental measurement technique that enables the in-situ imaging of
the polaron cloud in ultracold quantum gases. The impurity atom is first
excited to an interacting state which induces the formation of a polaron cloud.
This is followed by the excitation of the impurity atom to a Rydberg state. Due
to the mesoscopic interaction range of Rydberg excitations, which can be tuned
by the principal numbers of the Rydberg state, atoms extracted from the polaron
cloud form dimers with the impurity. By performing first principle calculations
of the absorption spectrum based on a functional determinant approach, we show
how the occupation of the dimer state can be directly observed in spectroscopy
experiments and can be mapped onto the density profile of the gas particles,
hence providing a direct, real-time, and in-situ measure of the polaron cloud.

We investigate the electronic and phonon properties of hydrogen sulfide
(SH$_3$) under ultrahigh pressure to elucidate the origin of its high-T$_c$
superconductivity. Contrary to the prevailing belief that the metalized S-H
$\sigma$ bond is responsible, our analysis, based on the anisotropic
Migdal-Eliashberg equation and the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP)
calculation, reveals that the H-H $\sigma$-antibonding states play a dominant
role in the large electron-phonon coupling that leads to the superconducting
pairing in SH$_3$. Furthermore, by partially restricting the vibration of S
atoms, we demonstrate that the S-H bonds provide subsidiary contributions to
the pairing interaction. These findings shed light on the importance of the
previously overlooked H-H $\sigma^*$ bonds in driving high-T$_c$
superconductivity in SH$_3$ and offer insights into the relationship between
metallic H-H covalent antibonding and high-T$_c$ superconductivity in other
hydrogen-rich materials under high pressure.

<h3>A New Approach to Measure Fundamental Microstructural Influences on the  Magnetic Properties of Electrical Steel using a Miniaturized Single Sheet  Tester</h3>

Magnetic properties of electrical steel are usually measured on Single Sheet
Testers, Epstein frames or ring cores. Due to the geometric dimensions and
measurement principles of these standardized setups, the fundamental
microstructural influences on the magnetic behavior, e.g., deformation
structures, crystal orientation or grain boundaries, are difficult to separate
and quantify. In this paper, a miniaturized Single Sheet Tester is presented
that allows the characterization of industrial steel sheets as well as from in
size limited single, bi- and oligocrystals starting from samples with
dimensions of 10x22 mm. Thereby, the measurement of global magnetic properties
is coupled with microstructural analysis methods to allow the investigation of
micro scale magnetic effects. An effect of grain orientation, grain boundaries
and deformation structures has already been identified with the presented
experimental setup. In addition, a correction function is introduced to allow
quantitative comparisons between differently sized Single Sheet Testers. This
approach is not limited to the presented Single Sheet Tester geometry, but
applicable for the comparison of results of differently sized Single Sheet
Testers. The results of the miniaturized Single Sheet Tester were validated on
five industrial electrical steel grades. Furthermore, first results of
differently oriented single crystals as well as measurements on grain-oriented
electrical steel are shown to prove the additional value of the miniaturized
Single Sheet Tester geometry.

In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of the
spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice using the
orthogonalized finite-temperature Lanczos method.
Under a zero magnetic field, the specific heat exhibits a double-peak
structure, as $|J_2|$ increases.
Additionally, at approximately $J_2=0$, the magnetic entropy remains finite,
even at low temperatures. The finite-temperature magnetization curve reveals
the asymmetric melting behavior of the 1/3 plateau around $J_2=0$. As $|J_2|$
increases, the 1/3 plateau becomes more stable, exhibiting symmetric melting
behavior. Specifically, for $J_2 > 0$, the $\bf Q=0$ up-up-down structure is
stabilized, whereas for $J_2 < 0$, the $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ up-up-down
structure is stabilized.

<br>
<br>
The density fluctuation spectrum is a key experimental observable that
captures many of the fundamental properties of strange metals. Using
momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we recently
showed that the density response of the strange metal
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) at large momentum, $q$, exhibits a
constant-in-frequency continuum reminiscent of the marginal Fermi liquid
hypothesis of the late 1980s. However, reconciling this observation with
infrared optics experiments, which establish a well-defined plasmon excitation
at $q=0$, has been challenging. Here we report M-EELS measurements of Bi-2212
using 4$\times$ improved resolution, allowing us to reach the optical limit
where direct comparison with IR optics is possible. We find that the M-EELS
data are consistent with a well-defined plasmon for $q<0.04$ r.l.u.. At
$q>0.04$ r.l.u., the spectra become incoherent with an MFL-like,
constant-in-frequency form. We speculate that, at finite frequency, $\omega$,
and nonzero $q$, some attribute of this Planckian metal randomizes the probe
electron in a way that causes it to lose information about its own momentum.

The helical magnetic structures of cubic chiral systems are well-explained by
the competition among Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,
cubic anisotropy, and anisotropic exchange interaction (AEI). Recently, the
role of the latter has been argued theoretically to be crucial for the
low-temperature phase diagram of the cubic chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, which
features tilted conical and disordered skyrmion states for a specific
orientation of the applied magnetic field ($\mu_0 \vec{\mathrm{H}} \parallel
[001]$). In this study, we exploit transmission resonant x-ray scattering
($t-$REXS) in vector magnetic fields to directly quantify the strength of the
AEI in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, and measure its temperature dependence. We find that the
AEI continuously increases below 50\,K, resulting in a conical spiral pitch
variation of $10\%$ in the (001) plane. Our results contribute to establishing
the interaction space that supports tilted cone and low-temperature skyrmion
state formation, facilitating the goals for both a quantitative description and
eventual design of the diverse spiral states existing amongst chiral magnets.

Studying the edge states of a topological system and extracting their
topological properties is of great importance in understanding and
characterizing these systems. In this paper, we present a novel analytical
approach for obtaining explicit expressions for the edge states in the
Kane-Mele model within a ribbon geometry featuring armchair boundaries. Our
approach involves a mapping procedure that transforms the system into an
extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, specifically a two-leg ladder, in momentum
space. Through rigorous derivation, we determine various analytical properties
of the edge states, including their wave functions and energy dispersion.
Additionally, we investigate the condition for topological transition by solely
analyzing the edge states, and we elucidate the underlying reasons for the
violation of the bulk-edge correspondence in relatively narrow ribbons. Our
findings shed light on the unique characteristics of the edge states in the
quantum spin Hall phase of the Kane-Mele model and provide valuable insights
into the topological properties of such systems.

Disorder and electron-electron interaction play essential roles in the
physics of electron systems in condensed matter. In two-dimensional, quantum
Hall systems, extensive studies of disorder-induced localization have led to
the emergence of a scaling picture with a single extended state, characterized
by a power-law divergence of the localization length in the zero-temperature
limit. Experimentally, scaling has been investigated via measuring the
temperature dependence of plateau-to-plateau transitions between the integer
quantum Hall states (IQHSs), yielding a critical exponent $\kappa\simeq 0.42$.
Here we report scaling measurements in the fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS)
regime where interaction plays a dominant role. Our study is partly motivated
by recent calculations, based on the composite fermion theory, that suggest
identical critical exponents in both IQHS and FQHS cases to the extent that the
interaction between composite fermions is negligible. The samples used in our
experiments are two-dimensional electron systems confined to GaAs quantum wells
of exceptionally high quality. We find that $\kappa$ varies for transitions
between different FQHSs observed on the flanks of Landau level filling factor
$\nu=1/2$, and has a value close to that reported for the IQHS transitions only
for a limited number of transitions between high-order FQHSs with intermediate
strength. We discuss possible origins of the non-universal $\kappa$ observed in
our experiments.

Non-Hermitian skin effect and photonic topological edge states are of great
interest in non-Hermitian physics and optics. However, the interplay between
them is largly unexplored. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally the
non-Hermitian skin effect that constructed from the nonreciprocal flow of
Floquet topological edge states, which can be dubbed 'Floquet skin-topological
effect'. We first show the non-Hermitian skin effect can be induced by pure
loss when the one-dimensional (1D) system is periodically driven. Next, based
on a two-dimensional (2D) Floquet topological photonic lattice with structured
loss, we investigate the interaction between the non-Hermiticity and the
topological edge states. We observe that all the one-way edge states are
imposed onto specific corners, featuring both the non-Hermitian skin effect and
topological edge states. Furthermore, a topological switch for the
skin-topological effect is presented by utilizing the gap-closing mechanism.
Our experiment paves the way of realizing non-Hermitian topological effects in
nonlinear and quantum regimes.

<h3>Possible $S_\pm$-wave superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, the bulk nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is reported to show signature
of high-temperature superconductivity under high pressure above $14$GPa (H. Sun
{\it et al.}, arXiv:2305.09586). We analyze the pairing mechanism and pairing
symmetry in a bi-layer Hubbard model with two orbitals in the $E_g$ multiplet.
In the weak to moderate interaction regime, our functional renormalization
group calculations yield $S_\pm$-wave Cooper pairing with dominant
$d_{3z^2-r^2}$-orbital content, triggered by spin fluctuations at wave vectors
near $(0.84, 0)\pi$ and $(0.75, 0.75)\pi$, up to $C_{4v}$ symmetry. The gap
function changes sign across the Fermi pockets. In the strong coupling limit,
we develop a low-energy effective theory in terms of atomic one- and
two-electron states in the $E_g$ multiplet. The effective theory predicts
naturally local pairing (with anti-phase between the two orbitals due to the
repulsive inter-orbital pair hopping) and strong singlet pairing on vertical
inter-layer bond, where the super-exchange between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$-orbital is
the strongest. The real-space structure is consistent with that from functional
renormalization group, suggesting the robustness of such a pairing function. We
also discuss a possible scenario for the weak insulating behavior under low
pressures in terms of the tendency toward the formation of charge order in the
strong coupling limit.

<h3>Quantum Hall bilayer in dipole representation</h3>

The quantum Hall bilayer (QHB) at filling factor $\nu = 1$ represents a
competition of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at small distances between
layers and fermionic condensation, which influence grows with distance and
results in two separate Fermi liquid states of underlying quasiparticles at
very large (infinite) distance. The most intriguing question is whether at
intermediate distances between layers a special, distinct phase exists, or a
single transition occurs, with possibility that this happens at infinite
distance. Here, using a dipole representation of fermionic quasiparticles, we
find a support for the latter scenario: for a large, relevant interval BEC
condensation, identified as a Cooper $s$-wave pairing of dipole quasiparticles,
wins over Cooper $p$-wave pairing and $s-$wave excitonic pairing of the same
quasiparticles.

Universal scaling laws govern the density of topological defects generated
while crossing an equilibrium phase transition. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism
predicts the dependence on the quench time for slow quenches. By contrast, for
fast quenches, the defect density scales universally with the amplitude of the
quench. We show that universal scaling laws apply to dynamic phase transitions
driven by an oscillating external field. The difference in the energy response
of the system to a periodic potential field leads to energy absorption,
spontaneous breaking of symmetry, and its restoration. Our results demonstrate
that the universality of critical dynamics extends beyond equilibrium
criticality, indicating its importance in understanding the behavior of
complex, non-equilibrium systems.

<br>
In the presented research, the intergranular elastic interaction and the
second-order plastic incompatibility stress in textured ferritic and austenitic
steels were investigated by means of diffraction. The lattice strains were
measured inside the samples by the multiple reflection method using high energy
X-rays diffraction during uniaxial in situ tensile tests. Comparing experiment
with various models of intergranular interaction, it was found that the
Eshelby-Kr\"oner model correctly approximates the X-ray stress factors (XSFs)
for different reflections hkl and scattering vector orientations. The verified
XSFs were used to investigate the evolution of the first and second-order
stresses in both austenitic and ferritic steels. It was shown that considering
only the elastic anisotropy, the non-linearity of $\sin^2{\psi}$ plots cannot
be explained by crystallographic texture. Therefore, a more advanced method
based on elastic-plastic self-consistent modeling (EPSC) is required for the
analysis. Using such methodology the non-linearities of $\cos^2{\phi}$ plots
were explained, and the evolutions of the first and second-order stresses were
determined. It was found that plastic deformation of about 1- 2% can completely
exchange the state of second-order plastic incompatibility stresses.

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a significant phenomenon observed in
non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions, where the extensive bulk
eigenstates tend to accumulate at the lattice edges. In this article, we
investigate how an electric field affects the localization properties in a
non-Hermitian mosaic Stark lattice, exploring the interplay between the Stark
localization, mobility edge (ME), and the NHSE induced by nonreciprocity. We
analytically obtain the Lyapunov exponent and the phase transition points as
well as numerically calculate the density distributions and the spectral
winding number. We reveal that in the nonreciprocal Stark lattice with the
mosaic periodic parameter $\kappa=1$, there exists a critical electric field
strength that describes the transition of the existence-nonexistence of NHSE
and is inversely proportional to the lattice size. This transition is
consistent with the real-complex transition and topological transition
characterized by spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions. In
the strong fields, the Wannier-Stark ladder is recovered, and the Stark
localization is sufficient to suppress the NHSE. When the mosaic period
$\kappa=2$, we show that the system manifests an exact non-Hermitian ME and the
skin states are still existing in the strong fields, in contrast to the
gigantic field can restrain the NHSE in the $\kappa=1$ case. Moreover, we
further study the expansion dynamics of an initially localized state and
dynamically probe the existence of the NHSE and the non-Hermitian ME. These
results could help us to control the NHSE and the non-Hermitian ME by using
electric fields in the disorder-free systems.

We present a general theory of the magnetic susceptibility of insulators that
can be extended to treat spatially varying and finite frequency fields. While
there are existing results in the literature for the zero frequency response
that appear to be in disagreement with each other, we show that the apparent
differences between them vanish with the use of various sum rules, and that our
result is in agreement with them. Although our strategy is based on the use of
Wannier functions, we show that our result can be written in a ``gauge
invariant" form involving Bloch functions. We can write it as the sum of terms
that involve the diagonal elements of the Berry connection, and this
decomposition is particularly useful in considering the limit of isolated
molecules. But these contributions can be repackaged to give a form independent
of those diagonal elements, which is thus generally more suitable for numerical
computation. We consider an h-BN model to demonstrate the practical
considerations in building a model and making calculations within this
formalism.

<h3>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for  epidemic inference</h3>

<br>
A novel generalized mean field approximation, called the Small-Coupling
Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, for Bayesian epidemic inference and risk
assessment is presented. The method is developed within a fully Bayesian
framework and accounts for non-causal effects generated by the presence of
observations. It is based on a graphical model representation of the epidemic
stochastic process and utilizes dynamic cavity equations to derive a set of
self-consistent equations for probability marginals defined on the edges of the
contact graph. By performing a small-coupling expansion, a pair of
time-dependent cavity messages is obtained, which capture the probability of
individual infection and the conditioning power of observations. In its
efficient formulation, the computational cost per iteration of the SCDC
algorithm is linear in the duration of the epidemic dynamics and in the number
of contacts. The SCDC method is derived for the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model
and straightforwardly applicable to other Markovian epidemic processes,
including recurrent ones. It exhibits high accuracy in assessing individual
risk on par with Belief Propagation techniques and outperforming heuristic
methods based on individual-based mean-field approximations. Although
convergence issues may arise due to long-range correlations in contact graphs,
the estimated marginal probabilities remain sufficiently accurate for reliable
risk estimation. Future work includes extending the method to non-Markovian
recurrent epidemic models and investigating the role of second-order terms in
the small coupling expansion of the observation-reweighted Dynamic Cavity
equations.

Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is pivotal for materials optical, magnetic,
topological, and transport properties. Chiral phonons, characterized by atoms
rotating unidirectionally around their equilibrium positions, generate dynamic
lattice structures that break TRS. Here we report that coherent chiral phonons,
driven by circularly polarized terahertz light pulses, can polarize the
paramagnetic spins in CeF3 like a quasi-static magnetic field on the order of 1
Tesla. Through time-resolved Faraday rotation and Kerr ellipticity, we found
the transient magnetization is only excited by pulses resonant with phonons,
proportional to the angular momentum of the phonons, and growing with magnetic
susceptibility at cryogenic temperatures, as expected from the spin-phonon
coupling model. The time-dependent effective magnetic field quantitatively
agrees with that calculated from phonon dynamics. Our results may open a new
route to directly investigate mode-specific spin-phonon interaction in
ultrafast magnetism, energy-efficient spintronics, and non-equilibrium phases
of matter with broken TRS.

A detailed interpretation of scanning tunneling spectra obtained on
unconventional superconductors enables one to gain information on the pairing
boson. Decisive for this approach are inelastic tunneling events. Due to the
lack of momentum conservation in tunneling from or to the sharp tip, those are
enhanced in the geometry of a scanning tunneling microscope compared to planar
tunnel junctions. This work extends the method of obtaining the bosonic
excitation spectrum by deconvolution from tunneling spectra to nodal $d$-wave
superconductors. In particular, scanning tunneling spectra of slightly
underdoped $\mathrm{Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\delta}}$ with a $T_c$ of
$82\,\mathrm{K}$ and optimally doped $\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}}$ with a $T_c$
of $92\,\mathrm{K}$ reveal a resonance mode in their bosonic excitation
spectrum at $\Omega_\mathrm{res} \approx 63\,\mathrm{meV}$ and
$\Omega_\mathrm{res} \approx 61\,\mathrm{meV}$ respectively. In both cases, the
overall shape of the bosonic excitation spectrum is indicative of predominant
spin scattering with a resonant mode at $\Omega_\mathrm{res}<2\Delta$ and
overdamped spin fluctuations for energies larger than $2\Delta$. To perform the
deconvolution of the experimental data, we implemented an efficient iterative
algorithm that significantly enhances the reliability of our analysis.
