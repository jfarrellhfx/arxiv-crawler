<h3>Compressing the atomic cloud in a matter-wave stripe soliton</h3>

We consider an attractive quasi-one dimensional spin-orbit coupled
Bose-Einstein condensate (SOC BEC) confined in a periodic potential produced by
the combination of linear and nonlinear optical lattices, and study the effects
of squeezing a stripe soliton by varying the inter-atomic interaction in the
nonlinear lattice. It is observed that the nodes on the soliton arising
entirely due to the effect of spin-orbit coupling tend to disappear as we
increase the squeezing effect to finally get a stable fundamental soliton. This
leads us to conclude that external pressure can reduce the effect of spin-orbit
coupling in the SOC BEC and even convert the system to a traditional BEC
without spin-orbit coupling. We make use of an information theoretic measure to
visualize how does the atomic density distribution in the condensate respond to
continual reduction in the spin-orbit coupling effect.

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem, in the Kubo original formulation, is
based on the decomposition of the thermal agitation forces into a dissipative
contribution and a stochastically fluctuating term. This decomposition can be
avoided by introducing a stochastic velocity field, with correlation properties
deriving from linear response theory. Here, we adopt this field as the
comprehensive hydrodynamic/fluctuational driver of the kinematic equations of
motion. With this description, we show that the Langevin equations for a
Brownian particle interacting with a solvent fluid become particularly simple
and can be applied even in those cases in which the classical approach, based
on the concept of a stochastic thermal force, displays intrinsic difficulties
e.g., in the presence of the Basset force. We show that a convenient way for
describing hydrodynamic/thermal fluctuations is by expressing them in the form
of Extended Poisson-Kac Processes possessing prescribed correlation properties
and a continuous velocity density function. We further highlight the importance
of higher-order correlation functions in the description of the stochastic
hydrodynamic velocity field with special reference to short-time properties of
Brownian motion. We conclude by outlining some practical implications in
connection with the statistical description of particle motion in confined
geometries.

<h3>The teaching from entanglement: 2D deconfined quantum critical points  are not conformal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11742" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11742</a>

The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) -- the enigmatic incarnation of
the quantum phase transition beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm of
symmetries and their spontaneous breaking -- has been proposed and actively
pursued for more than two decades. Various 2D quantum many-body lattice models,
both in spin/boson and fermion representations have been tested with the
state-of-the-art numerical techniques and field-theoretical analyses, and yet,
the conclusion is still controversial. Experimental realizations of DQCP in the
quantum magnet SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and superconducting quantum criticality in
2D material have either shown first order transition or intermediate phase. The
tensions between the lattice scale details and the requirements from continuum
limits, manifested in the form of the inconsistent critical scaling behavior
and violations of generic conformal bootstrap bound, have not been resolved.
Here we solve these decades-long controversies from the new and fundamental
perspective of the quantum entanglement. We develop the incremental algorithm
to compute the entanglement entropy at a fermionic DQCP with unprecedentedly
accurate data and reveal the universal coefficient of the logarithmic
correction therein is negative and at odds with positivity requirement of the
conformal field theory. Together with results in other 2D DQCP lattice models
(both in fermion and spin systems), our discoveries clearly demonstrate the 2D
DQCP models are not conformal fixed point and naturally explain the
experimental difficulties in finding DQCP therein. This marks the end of the
beginning of unambiguous finding of the quantum phase transitions truely beyond
the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, since its suggestion two decades ago.

<h3>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11968" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11968</a>

Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing
number of applications. Many of the passive damping methods rely on using low
stiffness dissipative elements, complex mechanical structures or electrical
systems, while active vibration damping systems typically add an additional
layer of complexity. However, in many cases, the reduced stiffness or
additional complexity and mass render these vibration damping methods
unfeasible. Here, we introduce a method for passive vibration damping by
allowing buckling of the primary load path, which sets an upper limit for
vibration transmission: the transmitted acceleration saturates at a maximum
value, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads
to an extreme damping coefficient tan delta ~0.23 in our metal
metamaterial|orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping of traditional
lightweight structural materials. We demonstrate this principle experimentally
and numerically in free-standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over
a range of accelerations, and show that bi-directional buckling can further
improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way towards extreme
vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and as such could be
applicable in a multitude of high-tech applications, including aerospace
structures, vehicles and sensitive instruments.

<h3>Anomalous Electronic Transport in High Mobility Corbino Rings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12147</a>

<i>Sujatha Vijayakrishnan, F. Poitevin, Oulin Yu, Z. Berkson-Korenberg, M. Petrescu, M.P Lilly, T. Szkopek, K. Agarwal, K. W. West, L. N. Pfeiffer, G. Gervais</i>
<br>
<br>
We report low-temperature electronic transport measurements performed in two
multi-terminal Corbino samples formed in GaAs/Al-GaAs two-dimensional electron
gases (2DEG) with both ultra-high electron mobility ($\gtrsim 20\times 10^6$
$cm^2/Vs)$ and with distinct electron density of $1.7$ and $3.6\times
10^{11}~cm^{-2}$. In both Corbino samples, a non-monotonic behavior is observed
in the temperature dependence of the resistance below 1~$K$. Surprisingly, a
sharp {\it decrease} in resistance is observed with {\it increasing}
temperature in the sample with lower electron density, whereas an opposite
behavior is observed in the sample with higher density. To investigate further,
transport measurements were performed in large van der Pauw samples having
identical heterostructures, and as expected they exhibit resistivity that is
monotonic with temperature. Finally, we discuss the results in terms of various
lengthscales leading to ballistic and hydrodynamic electronic transport, as
well as a possible Gurzhi effect.

<h3>Order from disorder phenomena in BaCoS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12179" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12179</a>

<br>
<br>
At $T_N\simeq 305~\text{K}$ the layered insulator BaCoS$_2$ transitions to a
columnar antiferromagnet that signals non-negligible magnetic frustration
despite the relatively high $T_N$, all the more surprising given its quasi
two-dimensional structure. Here, we show by combining ab initio and model
calculations that the magnetic transition is an order-from-disorder phenomenon,
which not only drives the columnar $C_4\to C_2$ symmetry breaking, but also,
and more importantly, the inter-layer coherence responsible for the finite
N\'eel transition temperature. This uncommon ordering mechanism, actively
contributed by orbital degrees of freedom, hints at an abundance of low energy
excitations below and, especially, above $T_N$, not in disagreement with
experimental evidences, and might as well emerge in other layered correlated
compounds showing frustrated magnetism at low temperature.

<h3>Enhancement of the Rate of Surface Reactions by Elasto-capillary Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11574" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11574</a>
<br>
<i>Nitish Singh, Animangsu Ghatak</i>
<br>
<br>
Rate of a reaction is enhanced by increase in temperature, partial pressure
or the concentration of reactants, and/or via use of a catalyst or an enzyme.
Whereas the former increases the probability of collision rate between
different molecules, the latter provides an alternate reaction path that
diminishes the activation energy barrier for reaction, both effects increase
the reaction rate. The deformability of the substrate on which a reaction
occurs is not known to affect this rate. In contrast, by carrying out reduction
of Gold and Silver salt on soft, crosslinked layers of poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS), we show here that surface tension driven deformation of the solid too
can increase the reaction rate. The PDMS contains SiH groups as organosilanes
which reduces the salt thereby producing the corresponding metallic
nano-particles. When an aqueous solution of the salt is dispensed as a sessile
drop on a sufficiently soft PDMS layer, nano-particles get generated at ~3
times the rate over which when the salt solution is dispensed as a pool on the
same surface. Unlike the pool, the drop has a three-phase contact line, where
it pulls up the solid forming a ridge. By balancing the resultant surface
stresses at the vicinity of this ridge, we have estimated the excess surface
free energy associated with it. We show that this excess energy can diminish
the activation energy barrier and increase the reaction rate to the extent that
would have been achieved by increasing the reaction temperature by over 30o C.

<h3>Cavity Moiré Materials: Controlling Magnetic Frustration with Quantum  Light-Matter Interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11582" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11582</a>

Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between light
and matter at the single quantum level and has played a central role in quantum
science and technology. Combining the idea of cavity QED with moir\'e
materials, we theoretically show that strong quantum light-matter interaction
provides a way to control frustrated magnetism. Specifically, we develop a
theory of moir\'e materials confined in a cavity consisting of thin polar van
der Waals crystals. We show that nontrivial quantum geometry of moir\'e flat
bands leads to electromagnetic vacuum dressing of electrons, which produces
appreciable changes in single-electron energies and manifests itself as
long-range electron hoppings. We apply our general formulation to a twisted
transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer encapsulated by ultrathin
hexagonal boron nitride layers and predict its phase diagram at different twist
angles and light-matter coupling strengths. Our results indicate that the
cavity confinement enables one to control magnetic frustration of moir\'e
materials and might allow for realizing various exotic phases such as a quantum
spin liquid.

<h3>Series expansion studies of the $J_1$-$J_2$-Heisenberg bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11599" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11599</a>
<br>
<i>Erik Wagner, Wolfram Brenig</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a bilayer of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg-model on the
square lattice. Starting from the dimer limit at strong interlayer coupling, we
perform series expansions using the perturbative Continuous Unitary
Transformation, based on the flow equation method, in order to determine the
spectrum up to the two-triplon sector. From the one-triplon dispersion we
obtain quantum critical lines for transitions from the dimer phase into either
N\'eel or collinear magnetic order. For low to intermediate frustration these
transitions are consistent with existing findings, based on the magnetic
phases. In the region of strongest frustration, i.e. $J_2/J_1\sim 0.5$, we
provide an estimate for the stability of the anticipated single-layer quantum
spin-liquids against finite interlayer coupling. In the two-triplon sector we
find a set of well defined (anti)bound states, which can be classified
according to total spin and in-plane rotational symmetry. For vanishing
frustration these states agree with previous series expansion analysis. For
$J_2/J_1\gtrsim 0.5$ we provide evidence for a close-by condensation of
one-triplon and two-triplon singlet bound states, suggesting that between the
dimer and the collinear state, additional phases may intervene.

<h3>Effective action approach to the filling anomaly in crystalline  topological matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11602</a>

In two dimensions, magnetic higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are
characterized by excess boundary charge and a compensating bulk ``filling
anomaly.'' At the same time, without additional noncrystalline symmetries, the
boundaries of two-dimensional HOTIs are gapped and featureless at low energies,
while the bulk of the system is predicted to have a topological response to the
insertion of lattice (particularly disclination) defects. Until recently, a
precise connection between these effects has remained elusive. In this work, we
provide a unifying field-theoretic description for the bulk and boundary
response of magnetic HOTIs. By focusing on the low-energy description of the
gapped boundary of a HOTI, we show that the boundary charge and filling anomaly
arise from the gravitational ``Gromov-Jensen-Abanov'' (GJA) response action
first introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 126802 (2016)] in the context of the
quantum Hall effect. As in quantum Hall systems the GJA action cancels apparent
anomalies associated with bulk response to disclinations, allowing us to derive
a concrete connection between the bulk and boundary theories of HOTIs. We show
how our results elucidate the connection between higher order topology and
geometric response both in band insulators, and point towards a new route to
understanding interacting higher order topological phases.

<h3>Compact Wannier Functions in One Dimension</h3>

<br>
<br>
Wannier functions have widespread utility in condensed matter physics and
beyond. Topological physics on the other hand has largely involved the related
notion of compactly supported Wannier-type functions which arise naturally in
flat bands. In this work, we establish a connection between these two notions,
by finding the necessary and sufficient conditions under which compact Wannier
functions exist in one dimension. We present an exhaustive construction of
models with compact Wannier functions and show that the Wannier functions are
unique and in general, distinct from the corresponding maximally localized
Wannier functions.

<h3>Reversal of coupled vortices in advanced spintronics: A mechanistic  study</h3>

This study conducts a comprehensive investigation into the reversal mechanism
of magnetic vortex cores in a nanopillar system composed of two coupled
ferromagnetic dots under zero magnetic field conditions. The research employs a
combination of experimental and simulation methods to gain a deeper
understanding of the dynamics of magnetic vortex cores. The findings reveal
that by applying a constant direct current, the orientation of the vortex cores
can be manipulated, resulting in a switch in one of the dots at a specific
current value. The micromagnetic simulations provide evidence that this switch
is a consequence of a deformation in the vortex profile caused by the
increasing velocity of the vortex cores resulting from the constant amplitude
of the trajectory as frequency increases. These findings offer valuable new
insights into the coupled dynamics of magnetic vortex cores and demonstrate the
feasibility of manipulating their orientation using direct currents under zero
magnetic field conditions. The results of this study have potential
implications for the development of vortex-based non-volatile memory
technologies. \end{abstract}

<h3>Superconducting valence bond fluid in lightly doped 8-leg $t$-$J$  cylinders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11633</a>
<br>
<i>Hong-Chen Jiang, Steven A. Kivelson, Dung-Hai Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconductivity in doped quantum paramagnets has been a subject of long
theoretical inquiry. In this work we report a density matrix renormalization
group study of lightly doped $t$-$J$ models on the square lattice (doped hole
densities $\delta = 1/12$ and 1/8) with parameters for which previous studies
have suggested that the undoped system in 2D is either a quantum spin liquid or
a valence bond crystal. Our studies are performed on cylinders with width up to
8. Ground-state correlations are found to be nearly identical for the ``doped
quantum spin liquid'' and ``doped valence bond crystal''. Upon increasing the
cylinder width from 4 to 8, we observed a significant strengthening of the
quasi-long-range superconducting correlations, and a dramatic suppression of
any ``competing'' charge-density-wave order. Extrapolating from the observed
behavior of the width 8 cylinders, we speculate that the system has a nodeless
d-wave superconducting ground-state in the 2D limit.

<i>Kerui Lai, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper presents a Python software package, Ph3pyWF, providing a more
convenient platform to realize high-throughput analysis of lattice thermal
conductivity for ceramic materials. The interface of Ph3pyWF is friendly for
users with different needs and from different level. For novices of interests,
the inputs can be quite simple, just with initial unit cell structure. Other
parameters would be automatically filled. And for expert-level researchers with
varied requirements, plenty of procedure parameters can be customized. The core
concept of Ph3pyWF is to build a data exchange and task management system with
high efficiency. The design details of the Ph3pyWF will be clarified in this
paper and following with a few typical oxide ceramics examples to demonstrate
the applicability of this software package.

The atomic-level structure of bulk metallic glasses is a key determinant of
their properties. An accurate representation of amorphous systems in
computational studies has traditionally required large supercells that are
unfortunately computationally demanding to handle using the most accurate ab
initio calculations. To address this, we propose to specifically design
small-cell structures that best reproduce the local geometric descriptors
(e.g., pairwise distances or bond angle distributions) of a large-cell
simulation. We rely on molecular dynamics (MD) driven by empirical potentials
to generate the target descriptors, while we use reverse Monte Carlo (RMC)
methods to optimize the small-cell structure. The latter can then be used to
determine mechanical and electronic properties using more accurate electronic
structure calculations. The method is implemented in the Metallic Amorphous
Structures Toolkit (MAST) software package.

<br>
<br>
Consistency between the exchange-correlation (xc) functional used during
pseudopotential construction and planewave-based electronic structure
calculations is important for an accurate and reliable description of the
structure and properties of condensed-phase systems. In this work, we present a
general scheme for constructing pseudopotentials with range-separated hybrid
(RSH) xc functionals based on the solution of the all-electron radial
integro-differential equation for a spherical atomic configuration. As
proof-of-principle, we demonstrate pseudopotential construction with the PBE,
PBE0, HSE, and sRSH (based on LC-$\omega$PBE0) xc functionals for a select set
of atoms, and then investigate the importance of pseudopotential consistency
when computing band gaps, equilibrium lattice parameters, bulk moduli, and
atomization energies of several solid-state systems. In doing so, we find that
pseudopotential consistency errors (PSCE) tend to be systematic and can be as
large as $1.4\%$ when computing these properties.

<h3>Hilbert space fragmentation in a longer-range system</h3>

We study the role of the interaction range on the Hilbert space fragmentation
and many-body scar states considering a spin-1/2 many-body Hamiltonian
describing a generalized Fredkin spin chain. We show that both scar states and
weak fragmentation of the Hilbert space survive for almost any range of the
coupling. Finally we investigate the effects of such structures of the Hilbert
space on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics, triggered by certain initial states,
characterized by either local persistent oscillations or non-uniform stationary
profile of the magnetization.

<h3>Möbius boron-nitride nanobelts interacting with heavy metal  nanoclusters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11697</a>

<br>
<br>
How do nickel, cadmium, and lead nanoclusters interact with boron-nitride and
Mobius-type boron-nitride nanobelts? To answer this question, we used the
semiempirical tight binding framework, as implemented in the xTB software, to
determine the lowest energy geometries, binding energy, complexes stability,
and electronic properties. Our calculations show that heavy metal nanoclusters
favorably bind to both boron-nitride nanobelts, although the interaction is
stronger with the Mobius-type nanobelt. The calculations show that the nickel
nanocluster has the lowest binding energy and the greatest charge transfer with
the nanobelts, followed by the cadmium and lead nanoclusters. During the
simulation time, the molecular dynamic simulation showed that all complexes
were stable at 298 K. Following the nanobelt's symmetry, the frontier orbitals
are distributed homogeneously throughout the structure. This distribution
changed when the nanobelt was twisted to create the Mobius-type nanobelt. The
topological study indicated that the number of bonds between the metal
nanoclusters and the Mobius-type nanobelt doubled and that the bonds formed
with the nickel nanocluster were stronger than those formed with the cadmium
and lead metals. Combining all the results, we conclude that the nickel
nanoclusters are chemisorbed, whereas the cadmium and lead nanoclusters are
physisorbed in both nanobelts.

<h3>The influence of crystalline electric field on the magnetic properties  of CeCd3X3 (X = P and As)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11714</a>

<br>
<br>
CeCd$_3$P$_3$ and CeCd$_3$As$_3$ compounds adopt the hexagonal
ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type structure, where magnetic Ce ions on a triangular lattice
order antiferromagnetically below $T_\text{N} \sim$0.42~K. Their crystalline
electric field (CEF) level scheme has been determined by fitting magnetic
susceptibility curves, magnetization isotherms, and Schottky anomalies in
specific heat. The calculated results, incorporating the CEF excitation, Zeeman
splitting, and molecular field, are in good agreement with the experimental
data. The CEF model, with Ce$^{3+}$ ions in a trigonal symmetry, explains the
strong easy-plane magnetic anisotropy that has been observed in this family of
materials. A detailed examination of the CEF parameters suggests that the
fourth order CEF parameter $B_{4}^{3}$ is responsible for the strong CEF
induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy, with a large $ab$-plane moment and a
small $c$-axis moment. The reliability of our CEF analysis is assessed by
comparing the current study with earlier reports of CeCd$_{3}$As$_{3}$. For
both CeCd$_{3}X_{3}$ ($X$ = P and As) compounds, less than 40 \% of $R\ln(2)$
magnetic entropy is recovered by $T_\text{N}$ and full $R\ln(2)$ entropy is
achieved at the Weiss temperature $\theta_{p}$. Although the observed magnetic
entropy is reminiscent of delocalized 4$f$-electron magnetism with significant
Kondo screening, the electrical resistivity of these compounds follows a
typical metallic behavior. Measurements of thermoelectric power further
validate the absence of Kondo contribution in CeCd$_{3}X_{3}$.

We detect correlations in qubit-energy fluctuations of non-neighboring qubits
defined in isotopically purified Si/SiGe quantum dots. At low frequencies
(where the noise is strongest), the correlation coefficient reaches 10% for a
next-nearest-neighbor qubit-pair separated by 200 nm. Assigning the observed
noise to be of electrical origin, a simple theoretical model quantitatively
reproduces the measurements and predicts a polynomial decay of correlations
with interqubit distance. Our results quantify long-range correlations of noise
dephasing quantum-dot spin qubits arranged in arrays, essential for scalability
and fault-tolerance of such systems.

<h3>A doping threshold for polar metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11721" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11721</a>

The possible coexistence of electric dipoles and itinerant electrons in a
solid was postulated decades ago, before being experimentally established in
several 'polar metals' during the last decade. Here,we establish the existence
of concentration driven polar to non-polar phase transition in electron doped
BaTiO3. Comparing our case with other polar metals, we find a particular
threshold concentration (n*), proportional to the dipole density (n_d), for the
termination of polar phase. The universal ratio n_d/n*=8(0.6) indicates a
common mechanism in different polar systems and put stringent constraints on
relevant theories. We argue that this polar threshold could be accounted for by
an anti-polar interaction between neighboring dipoles through a dipolar
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida theory. Moreover, in the case of BaTiO3, we find
an enhancement in thermopower and upturn on resistivity at low temperatures in
the vicinity of n*. Both these features point to a dipolar-Kondo effect, where
dipole fluctuations couple to the surrounding electron clouds. Our findings
unveil a mostly unexplored territory for the exploration of emerging physics
associated with correlations between electrons and electric dipoles.

Recent experiment reported the robust zero-energy states with strange
properties in a trilayer heterostructure MnTe/Bi2Te3/Fe(Te,Se). Here, we give
comprehensive understandings about the magnetic and electronic properties of
the heterostructure, and propose ferromagnetic Mn-Bi antisite defects are
generated in the topmost sublayer of Bi2Te3 and hidden below the MnTe layer. We
further reveal the defect can induce two types of quasiparticles. One is
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state from defect itself, and another is Majorana zero mode
from the superconducting phase domain wall induced by the defect. The two types
of quasiparticles have very different response to magnetic field, temperature
etc. The coexistence and mutual cooperation of both can explain experimental
observations. Furthermore, we propose more simple heterostructure with
superiority to generate and finely modulate Majorana zero modes.

An ensemble of neutral excitations is constructed experimentally in the
Laughlin liquid at the electron filling factor 1/3. The excitations are found
to induce a nonlinear optical response, manifested as a quadratic dependence of
the reflection signal on the excitation power. The reported experimental
results indicate that the observed effect is due to the contribution of the
coherent anti-Stokes-Stokes scattering of light from the excited Laughlin
liquid.

Dense particle suspension under shear may lose its uniform state to large
fluctuations of the local density and stress. Here, we explore a novel unsteady
dynamics of a non-Brownian suspension under circular oscillation, where
localized density waves appear beyond an excitation frequency threshold and
self-organize into an hexagonal pattern with increasing frequency. A simplified
two-phase flow model is analyzed, and the predicted onset frequency of density
waves, based on linear stability analysis, matches the experimental
measurements quantitatively. Our results show that this instability is closely
related to the discontinuous shear thickening transition of the suspension. In
addition, the crucial role of the free surface is discussed.

<br>
<br>
NiCo2O4 (NCO) films grown on MgAl2O4 (001) substrates have been studied using
magnetometry, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) based on x-ray
absorption spectroscopy, and spin-polarized inverse photoemission spectroscopy
(SPIPES) with various thickness down to 1.6 nm. The magnetic behavior can be
understood in terms of a layer of optimal NCO and an interfacial layer (1.2+/-
0.1 nm), with a small canting of magnetization at the surface. The thickness
dependence of the optimal layer can be described by the finite-scaling theory
with a critical exponent consistent with the high perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. The interfacial layer couples antiferromagnetically to the optimal
layer, generating exchange-spring styled magnetic hysteresis in the thinnest
films. The non-optimal and measurement-speed-dependent magnetic properties of
the interfacial layer suggest substantial interfacial diffusion.

<h3>Membrane buckling and the determination of Gaussian curvature modulus</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11745</a>
<br>
<i>Mei-Ting Wang, Rui Ma, Chen-Xu Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Biological membranes are able to exhibit various morphology due to the
fluidity of the lipid molecules within the monolayers. The shape transformation
of membranes has been well described by the classical Helfrich theory, which
consists only a few phenomenological parameters, including the mean and the
Gaussian curvature modulus. Though various methods have been proposed to
measure the mean curvature modulus, determination of the Gaussian curvature
modulus remains difficult both in experiments and in simulation. In this paper
we study the buckling process of a rectangular membrane and a circular membrane
subject to compressive stresses and under different boundary conditions. We
find that the buckling of a rectangular membrane takes place continuously,
while the buckling of a circular membrane can be discontinous depending on the
boundary conditions. Furthermore, our results show that the stress-strain
relationship of a buckled circular membrane can be used to effectively
determine the Gaussian curvature modulus.

We present diffusiophoresis of ellipsoidal particles induced by ionic solute
gradients. Contrary to the common expectation that diffusiophoresis is
shape-independent, here we show experimentally that this assumption breaks down
when the thin Debye layer approximation is relaxed. By tracking the translation
and rotation of various ellipsoids, we find that the phoretic mobility of
ellipsoids is sensitive to the eccentricity and the orientation of the
ellipsoid relative to the imposed solute gradient, and can further lead to
non-monotonic behavior under strong confinement. We show that such shape- and
orientation-dependent diffusiophoresis of colloidal ellipsoids can be easily
captured by modifying theories for spheres.

<h3>Quantum dephasing of kagome superconductivity</h3>

Recent observations for a pressurized kagome superconductor through
transport, muon spin relaxation, nuclear magnetic resonance, and point contact
spectroscopy demonstrate striking fluctuating superconductivity at a magic
pressure. This discovery may hint at a new quantum dephasing mechanism, which
can be discussed from the perspectives of correlation and topology. Three
outstanding questions should be considered in decoding this mechanism: one is
the intrinsic phase fragile nature of kagome superconductivity; second is the
role of Coulomb interactions within different charge-ordered phases; third is
the geometrical phase compatibility between superconductivity and different
charge orders.

We investigate a population of swarmalators, a mobile version of phase
oscillators that both sync in time and swarm through space. We focus on a
XY-type model of identical swarmalators running on a one-dimensional ring and
subject to thermal noise. We uncover four distinct collective states, some of
which capture the behavior of real-world swarmalators such as vinegar eels and
sperm. Among these, the most intriguing is the `mixed state', which blends two
of the other states. We present a comprehensive phase diagram from the Fourier
mode analysis with a high accuracy, which is in excellent agreement with
numerical simulation results. Our model serves as a tractable toy model for
thermal systems that both self-synchronize and self-assemble interdependently.

<h3>Pressure induced electride phase formation in calcium: A key to its  strange high-pressure behavior</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Elemental calcium (Ca), a simple metal at ambient conditions, has attracted
huge interest because of its unusual high-pressure behavior in structural,
electrical, and melting properties whose origin remain unsolved. Here, using a
theoretical framework appropriate for describing electride phase formation,
i.e., the presence of anionic electrons, we establish electride formation in Ca
at a pressure as low as 8 GPa. Our analysis shows that under pressure the
valence electrons of Ca localize at octahedral holes and exhibit anionic
character which is responsible for its strange pressure behavior. Our
calculated enthalpy and electrical resistance indicate that Ca will directly
transform from an FCC-electride phase to an SC-electride phase near 30 GPa
thereby avoiding the intermediate BCC phase. These findings are not limited to
Ca but might hold a key to the understanding of host-guest type structures
which occur in other elemental solids though at much higher pressures.

In two-dimensional materials electronic band contacts often give non-trivial
contribution to materials topological properties. Besides band contacts at
high-symmetry points (HSP) in the Brillouin zone (BZ), like those in graphene,
there are nodal lines which form various patterns in the reciprocal space. In
this paper we have found all movable nodal lines, which shape depends on the
model, that pass through HSPs in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. Cases
with and without spin-orbit coupling are included by studying all eighty layer
groups and their double extensions. Eight single and six double groups,
including three symmorphic, necessarily host Dirac and Weyl nodal lines that
extend through the whole BZ, respectively. Our research might be of interest in
designing new materials with interesting physical properties.

In this paper we demonstrate that the weak temperature dependence of
structure factor of supercooled liquids, a defining feature of the glass
transition, is an artefact of the spherical averaging typically employed in
these measurements. We show that the speckle scattering at individual
wavevectors, calculated from a simulated glass former, exhibits a sufficiently
large temperature dependence to represent a structural order parameter capable
of distinguishing liquid from glass. We also extract from the speckle
intensities a quantity proportional to the variance of the local restraint,
i.e. a direct experimental measure of the amplitude of structural
heterogeneity.

In this work, we report multiple intercalation stages and universal Tc
enhancement of superconductivity in 1T-SnSe2 through Li and organic molecules
cointercalation. We observe significantly increased lattice parameters up to 40
{\AA} and dramatically enlarged interlayer distance up to ~11{\AA} in Li and
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) cointercalated SnSe2. Well-separated
cointercalation stages with different stacking patterns have been discovered by
carefully controlled reaction time and concentration of solutions. These
cointercalation stages are superconductors showing different superconducting
signals. In addition, Li and various organic species such as Acetone, Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF) have been cointercalated into SnSe2
crystals, all of which show enhanced superconducting Tc compared to solely Li
intercalated SnSe2. Our findings may provide more insight to effectively tune
electronic structure of the lamellar structure through organic molecules
co-regulation, and open a new strategy to engineer the physical properties of
these layered materials by controlling their different intercalation stages.

<h3>Deflection and oscillations of an anchored elastic fiber embedded in a  quasistatic two-dimensional foam flow</h3>

<br>
<i>Adrien Pellé, Marc Durand</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the deflection and fluctuations of a clamped elastic fiber embedded
in 2D foam under quasistatic flow. At all times, the fiber conformation results
from the elasto-capillary interactions with the foam. We independently measure
the action of capillary and pressure forces on the fiber, and show that the
fiber deformation is adequately described assuming a uniform continuous normal
force acting on it. When bending energy exceeds a threshold value, the fiber
relaxes to a less deflected shape, generating a cascade of plastic
rearrangements within the foam, and the process repeats periodically. We
analyze the statistical distributions of stored and released energy, and
estimate the yield stress and shear modulus of the foam, as well as the number
of elementary plastic events involved in a cascade.

<i>Salambô Dago, Ludovic Bellon</i>
<br>
<br>
The NOT operation is a reversible transformation acting on a 1-bit logical
state, and should be achievable in a physically reversible manner at no
energetic cost. We experimentally demonstrate a bit-flip protocol based on the
momentum of an underdamped oscillator confined in a double well potential. The
protocol is designed to be reversible in the ideal dissipationless case, and
the thermodynamic work required is inversely proportional to the quality factor
of the system. Our implementation demonstrates an energy dissipation
significantly lower than the minimal cost of information processing in
logically irreversible operations. It is moreover performed at high speed: a
fully equilibrated final state is reached in only half a period of the
oscillator. The results are supported by an analytical model that takes into
account the presence of irreversibility. The Letter concludes with a discussion
of optimization strategies.

<h3>Two- and Three-Particle Complexes with Logarithmic Interaction: Compact  Wave Functions for Two-Dimensional Excitons and Trions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Assuming a logarithmic interaction between constituent particles, compact and
locally accurate wave functions that describe bound states of the two-particle
neutral and three-particle charged complexes in two dimensions are designed.
Prime examples of these complexes are excitons and trions that appear in
monolayers of Transition-Metal DichalCogenides (TMDCs). In the case of
excitons, these wave functions led to 5-6 correct decimal digits in the energy
and the diamagnetic shifts. In addition, it is demonstrated that they can be
used as zero-order approximations to study magnetoexcitons via perturbation
theory in powers of the magnetic field strength. For the trion, making a
comparison with experimental data for concrete TMDCs, we established that the
logarithmic potential leads to binding energies $\lesssim 25\%$ greater than
experimental ones. Finally, the structure of the wave function at small
distances is established for excitons whose carriers interact via the
Rytova-Keldysh potential.

<h3>Yielding under compression and the polyamorphic transition in silicon</h3>

We investigate the behavior of amorphous silicon under hydrostatic
compression using molecular simulations. During compression, amorphous silicon
undergoes a discontinuous nonequilibrium transition from a low-density to a
high-density structure at a pressure of around $13$-$16$~GPa. Ensemble-averaged
density and elastic constants change discontinuously across the transition.
Densification of individual glassy samples occurs through a series of discrete
plastic events, each of which is accompanied by a vanishing shear modulus. This
is the signature of a series of elastic instabilities, similar to shear
transformation zones observed during shear yielding of glasses. We compare the
structure obtained during compression with a near-equilibrium form of amorphous
silicon obtained by quenching a melt at constant pressure. This gives
structures identical to nonequilibrium compression at low and high pressure,
but the transition between them occurs gradually rather than discontinuously.
Our observations indicate that the polyamorphic transition is of a
nonequilibrium nature, and it has the characteristics of a yield transition
that occurs under compression instead of shear.

Magnetic anisotropy is a key parameter of magnetic materials as it decides
the response in the presence of an external magnetic field. The artificial
tailoring of magnetic anisotropy by manipulating surface and interface
morphology is attracting widespread interest for its application in spintronic
and magnetic memory devices. In this perspective, the primary focus of this
thesis has been inducing and tailoring magnetic anisotropy in thin film-based
systems via the engineering of structure and surface/interfacial morphology.
For this purpose, instead of multistep, expensive lithographic techniques, we
have utilized low-energy IBE as a handy, cost-effective, and useful tool for
producing magnetic nanostructures and tailoring its surface structure,
morphology and magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, we have also proposed various
new and unconventional methods (oblique angle deposition on the rippled
substrate, sequential deposition-erosion) for enhancement of UMA and proved its
effectiveness via experiments. We have performed most of the present thesis
work in-situ utilizing a UHV chamber to get genuine characteristics and
understand their interdependencies. However, advanced synchrotron-based
techniques such as GISAXS and NFS were also utilized to complement the in-situ
observations.

Time-reversal invariance and inversion symmetry are responsible for the
topological band structure in Dirac semimetals. These symmetries can be broken
by applying an external magnetic or electric field, resulting in fundamental
changes to the ground state Hamiltonian and a topological phase transition. We
probe these changes via the magnetic-field dependence and gate
voltage-dependence of universal conductance fluctuations in top-gated nanowires
of the prototypical Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. As the magnetic field is increased
beyond the phase-breaking field, we find a factor of sqrt(2) reduction in the
magnitude of the universal conductance fluctuations, in agreement with
numerical calculations that study the effect of broken time reversal symmetry
in a 3D Dirac semimetal. In contrast, the magnitude of the fluctuations
increases monotonically as the chemical potential is gated away from the charge
neutrality point. This effect cannot be attributed to broken inversion
symmetry, but can be explained by Fermi surface anisotropy. The concurrence
between experimental data and theory in our study provides unequivocal evidence
that universal conductance fluctuations are the dominant source of intrinsic
transport fluctuations in mesoscopic Cd3As2 devices and offers a promising
general methodology for probing the effects of broken symmetry in topological
quantum materials.

Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field-effect transistors
(FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has
relied on the use of top-electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints
and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in
FETs based on solid-state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of
unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited
control and reproducibility. Here we explore a class of solid-state
electrolytes for gating (Lithium-ion conducting glass-ceramics, LICGCs),
identify the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and
irreproducible behavior,and demonstrate properly functioning transistors
exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of ~20-50
$\mu$F/cm$^2$ (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges). Using
two-dimensional semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides we demonstrate
the ability to implement ionic-gate spectroscopy to determine the
semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 10$^{14}$
cm$^{-2}$, resulting in gate-induced superconductivity in MoS$_2$ multilayers.
As LICGCs are implemented in a back-gate configuration, they leave the surface
of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface-sensitive techniques (such
as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so
far in ionic-liquid gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices
providing independent control of charge density and electric field.

Improving interfacial thermal transport is crucial for heat dissipation in
systems. Here, we design a strategy by utilizing the water
adsorption-desorption process in porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to tune
the interfacial heat transfer. We observe a changeable thermal conductance
across the solid/porous MOFs interfaces owing to the dense water channel formed
by the adsorbed water molecules in MOFs. Our experimental results show that the
interfacial thermal conductance of Au/Cu3(BTC)2 heterointerfaces is increased
up to 7.1 folds by this strategy, where Cu3(BTC)2 is a typical porous MOF and
usually referred to as HKUST-1. Our molecular dynamics simulations further show
that the surface tension of Au layer will cause the adsorbed water molecules in
HKUST-1 to gather at the interfacial region. The dense water channel formed at
the interfacial region can activate the high-frequency lattice vibrations and
act as an additional thermal pathway, and then enhance heat transfer across the
interfaces significantly. Our findings provide a new concept for tailoring
thermal transport at the solid/porous MOFs heterointerfaces which will largely
benefit MOF-related applications.

Online training of deep neural networks (DNN) can be significantly
accelerated by performing in-situ vector matrix multiplication in a crossbar
array of analog memories. However, training accuracies often suffer due to
device non-idealities such as nonlinearity, asymmetry, limited bit precision
and dynamic weight update range within constrained power budget. Here, we
report a three-terminal Ferroelectric-Field-Effect-Transistor based on low
thermal budget processes that can work efficiently as an analog synaptic
transistor. Ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) as the gate insulator and 2D
semiconductor MoS2 as the n-type semiconducting channel material makes them
suitable for flexible and wearable substrate integration. The analog
conductance of the FeFETs can be precisely manipulated by employing a
ferroelectric-dielectric layer as the gate stack. The ferroelectric-only
devices show excellent performance as digital non-volatile memory operating at
+-5V while the hybrid ferroelectric-dielectric devices show quasi-continuous
resistive switching resulting from gradual ferroelectric domain rotation,
important for their multibit operation. Analog conductance states of the hybrid
devices allow linearity and symmetry of weight updates and produce a dynamic
conductance range of 104 with >16 reproducible conducting states. Network
training experiments of these FeFETs show >96% classification accuracy with
MNIST handwritten datasets highlighting their potential for implementation in

Intercalation recent emerges as an effective way to manipulate ground-state
properties and enrich quantum phase diagrams of layered transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In this work, focusing on fully Ta-intercalated
bilayer TaS$_{2}$ with a stoichiometry of Ta$_{3}$S$_{4}$, which has recently
been experimentally synthesized, we computationally show the suppression of
intrinsic $3\times3$ charge-density wave (CDW) in bilayer TaS$_{2}$ section,
and emergence of a $2\times1$ CDW in intercalated Ta layer, based on
first-principle calculations. The formation of the CDW in Ta$_{3}$S$_{4}$ is
triggered by strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) between $d$-like orbitals of
intercalated Ta via the imaginary phonon modes at M point. A 2$\times$1 CDW
structure is identified, featuring quasi-one-dimensional Ta chains,
attributable to the competition between CDW displacements associated with
potential $\boldsymbol{q}_{\text{CDW}}$s. Superconductivity is found to coexist
with the 2$\times$1 CDW in Ta$_{3}$S$_{4}$, with an estimated superconducting
transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 3.0 K, slightly higher than that
of the bilayer TaS$_{2}$. The switch among the states without CDW, with
2$\times$1 CDW, and with $2\times$2 CDW can be achieved in Ta$_{3}$S$_{4}$~by
strains. Our work enriches quantum phase of TaS$_{2}$, offers a candidate
material to the study of the interaction between CDW and superconductivity, and
highlights the intercalation as an effective way to tune the physical
properties of layered materials.

Recent direct measurements of the growth kinetics of individual carbon
nanotubes revealed abrupt changes in the growth rate of nanotubes maintaining
the same crystal structure. These stochastic switches call into question the
possibility of chirality selection based on growth kinetics. Here, we show that
a similar average ratio between fast and slow rates of around 1.7 is observed
largely independent of the catalyst and growth conditions. A simple model,
supported by computer simulations, shows that these switches are caused by
tilts of the growing nanotube edge between two main orientations,
close-armchair or close-zigzag, inducing different growth mechanisms. The rate
ratio of around 1.7 then simply results from an averaging of the number of
growth sites and edge configurations in each orientation. Beyond providing new
insights on nanotube growth based on classical crystal growth theory, these
results point to ways to control the dynamics of nanotube edges, a key
requirement for stabilizing growth kinetics and producing arrays of long
structurally-selected nanotubes.

Traditional computational approaches in simulating crack propagation in
perfectly brittle materials rely on the estimate of stress intensity factors
along the rupture front. This proves highly challenging in 3D when the crack
geometry departs from very specific cases for which analytical solutions are
available, like e.g. the penny-shaped crack geometry. Here, we extend the
first-order theory of Gao and Rice (1987), and predict the distribution of the
mode I stress intensity factor $K_\mathrm{I}$ along the front of a tensile
coplanar crack that is slightly perturbed from a reference penny-shaped
configuration, up to second order in the perturbation amplitude. Our theory is
validated against analytical solutions available for embedded elliptical
cracks, and its range of validity is further assessed using numerical
simulations performed on cosine front perturbations of varying mode and
amplitude. It is then used to develop a homogenization framework for the
toughness of weakly disordered media. The effective toughness and its
fluctuations are bridged quantitatively to the intensity of the toughness
fluctuations and their spatial structure. Our theoretical predictions are
compared to the results of $\sim 1$ million simulations of crack propagation
building on our second-order theory and Fast Fourier Transforms. We show that
the impact of toughness heterogeneities is size-dependent, as they generally
weaken the material when the crack size is lower or comparable to the typical
heterogeneity size, but reinforces it otherwise. It results in an apparent
R-curve behavior of the brittle composite at the macroscale.

<br>
<br>
CoPS3 stands out in the family of the van der Waals antiferromagnets XPS3
(X=Mn, Ni, Fe, Co) due to the unquenched orbital momentum of the magnetic Co2+
ions which is known to facilitate the coupling of spins to both electromagnetic
waves and lattice vibrations. Here, using a time-resolved magneto-optical
pump-probe technique we experimentally study the ultrafast laser-induced
dynamics of mutually correlated spins and lattice. It is shown that a
femtosecond laser pulse acts as an ultrafast heater and thus results in the
melting of the antiferromagnetic order. At the same time, the resonant pumping
of the 4T1g - 4T2g electronic transition in Co2+ ions effectively changes their
orbital momentum, giving rise to a mechanical force that moves the ions in the
direction parallel to the orientation of their spins, thus generating a
coherent Bg phonon mode at the frequency of about 4.7 THz.

This paper reports formation enthalpies of phases in the Al-Mn-Pd ternary
alloy system as calculated from first principles using electronic density
functional theory. We consider all crystal structures as reported in the
assessed phase diagrams of the ternary and its binary alloy subsystems (Al-Mn,
Al-Pd, and Mn-Pd), as well as additional reported or hypothetical structures.
Icosahedral and decagonal quasicrystalline approximants are among the
structures that we predict to be stable, or nearly so. Our results suggest the
need for careful experimental reexamination of phase stability in each of the
alloy systems, in tandem with further efforts to refine crystallographic and
{\em ab-initio} structures.

The interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic interactions is central to
comprehending the intricate phases in heavy-fermion compounds. However, the
role of the itinerant magnetic order, which is driven by the conducting (c)
electrons, has been largely uncharted in the context of heavy-fermion systems
due to the scarcity of material candidates. Here we demonstrate the coexistence
of the coherent Kondo screening and d-orbital ferromagnetism in material system
La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$Co$_2$As$_2$, through comprehensive thermodynamic and
electrical transport measurements. Additionally, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we further observe the f-orbit-dominated
bands near the Fermi level ($E_f$) and signatures of the f-c hybridization
below the magnetic transition temperature, providing strong evidence of Kondo
lattice state in the presence of ferromagnetic order. Remarkably, by changing
the ratio of Ce/La, we observe a substantial enhancement of the anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) in the Kondo lattice regime. The value of the Hall conductivity
quantitatively matches with the first-principle calculation that optimized with
our ARPES results and can be attributed to the large Berry curvature (BC)
density engendered by the topological nodal rings composed of the Ce-4f and
Co-3d orbitals at $E_f$. Our findings point to the realization of a new
platform for exploring correlation-driven topological responses in a novel
Kondo lattice environment.

<br>
<br>
Intermetallic narrow-gap semiconductors have been intensively explored due to
their large thermoelectric power at low temperatures and a possible role of
strong electronic correlations in their unusual thermodynamic and transport
properties. Here we study the optical spectra and vibrational properties of
$\mathrm{FeGa_3}$ single crystal. The optical conductivity indicates that
$\mathrm{FeGa_3}$ has a direct band gap of $\sim 0.7$\,eV, consistent with
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Most importantly, we find a
substantial spectral weight also below 0.4~eV, which is the energy of a direct
(charge) gap found in resistivity measurements and ab initio calculations. We
find that the spectral weight below the gap decreases with increasing
temperature, which indicates that it originates from the impurity states and
not from the electronic correlations. Interestingly, we did not find any
signatures of the impurity states in vibrational spectra. The infrared and
Raman vibrational lines are narrow and weakly temperature dependent. The
vibrational frequencies are in excellent agreement with our DFT calculations,
implying a modest role of electronic correlations. Narrow M\" ossbauer spectral
lines also indicate high crystallinity of the sample.

<br>
<br>
Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of transmembrane channels that are found from
archaea, eubacteria, and fungi kingdoms to plants and animals. These proteins
play a major role in water and small solutes transport across biological cell
membranes and maintain the osmotic balance of living cells. In this sense, many
works in recent years have been devoted to understanding their behavior,
including in plants, where 5 major groups of AQPs have been identified, whose
physiological function details still have open questions waiting for an answer.
In this direction, we observed in the literature very few Molecular Modeling
studies focusing on plant AQPs. It creates a gap in the proper depiction of
AQPs since Molecular Simulations allow us to get information that is usually
inaccessible by experiments. Likewise, many efforts have been made to create
artificial nanochannels with improved properties. It has the potential to help
humanity (and plants) to face water stress -- a current problem that will be
worsened by Climate Change. In this short review, we will revisit and discuss
important computational studies about plant aquaporins and artificial
transmembrane channels. With this, we aim to show how the Molecular Modeling
community can (and should) help to understand plants' AQPs properties and
function and how we can create new nanotechnology-based artificial channels.

<h3>Elastic snap-through instabilities are governed by geometric symmetries</h3>

Many elastic structures exhibit rapid shape transitions between two possible
equilibrium states: umbrellas become inverted in strong wind and hopper popper
toys jump when turned inside-out. This snap-through is a general motif for the
storage and rapid release of elastic energy, and it is exploited by many
biological and engineered systems from the Venus flytrap to mechanical
metamaterials. Snap-through occurs when an elastic structure remains in an
equilibrium configuration that becomes unstable or suddenly disappears. While,
these shape transitions are known to be related to the type of bifurcation the
system undergoes, to date, there is no general understanding of the mechanisms
that select these bifurcations. Here we analyze numerically and analytically
two systems proposed in recent literature in which an elastic strip, initially
in a buckled state, is driven through shape transitions by either rotating or
translating its boundaries. We show that the two systems are mathematically
equivalent, and identify three cases that illustrate the entire range of
transitions described by previous authors. Importantly, using reduction order
methods, we establish the nature of the bifurcations these systems undergo, and
we explain how these bifurcations can be predicted from geometric symmetries
and symmetry-breaking mechanisms, thus providing universal design rules for
elastic shape transitions.

With the deceleration of dimensional and voltage scaling in CMOS
technologies, the demand for novel logic devices has never been greater. While
spin-based devices present a major opportunity towards favorable scaling,
switching energies are still orders of magnitude above the expected values.
Alternatively, magnetoelectric materials are predicted to enable low-power
control of magnetization, a relatively unexplored pathway with sparse results
at a device level. Here, we demonstrate voltage-based magnetization switching
and reading in nanodevices at room temperature, enabled by exchange coupling
between multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ and ferromagnetic CoFe, for the writing, and
spin-to-charge current conversion between CoFe and Pt, for the reading. Unlike
other current-based spintronic devices, magnetization writing is driven solely
by voltage pulses. We show that, upon electrical switching of the BiFeO$_3$,
the magnetization of the CoFe can be reversed, giving rise to different voltage
outputs. The voltage-induced switching is supported through a combination of
piezoresponse, magnetic force microscopy, and scanning nitrogen-vacancy
magnetometry, where magnetization reversal is linked with the polarization
state and antiferromagnetic cycloid propagation direction in the BiFeO$_3$.
This study constitutes the building block for magnetoelectric spin-orbit logic,
as well as a new avenue for low-power beyond-CMOS technologies.

<h3>GaTe-Assisted CVD Grown of Ultrathin Large-Scale 2D Ferromagnetic Cr5Te8</h3>

Recently, 2D Cr5Te8 has been successfully synthesized experimentally and has
attracted widespread research interest due to its intriguing magnetic
properties, such as hard magnetism with strong perpendicular anisotropy.
However, exploring new methods for growing ultrathin 2D Cr5Te8 with a larger
scale and their controllable synthesis remain challenging. Herein, the
synthesis of ultrathin 2D ferromagnetic Cr5Te8 nanosheets by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) using GaTe as growth source is reported, whose size is up to
~160 {\mu}m and the thickness is lower to only 5 nm. The GaTe promotes the
concentration of effective Te atoms to facilitate the direction of the
synthesis reaction, enabling the rapid lateral growth rate. As a result, the
synthesis of ultrathin, large-scale 2D ferromagnetic Cr5Te8 was achieved. By
precisely adjusting the growth temperature and the source-substrate distance
(Dss), the lateral size of the Cr5Te8 nanosheets can be tuned from a few to
~164 {\mu}m. Furthermore, magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) suggested
that Cr5Te8 nanosheets possess intense out-of-plane ferromagnetism and the
Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 163 to 175 K as the Cr5Te8
thickness. This work not only paves a way for the controllable growth of
ultrathin, large-scale 2D ferromagnetic crystalline, but also provides a new
platform for the spintronics and the practical application of magnetic memory
devices.

Ferroics based on transition-metal (TM) substituted SrTiO$_{3}$ have called
much attention as magnetism and/or ferroelectricity can be tuned by using
cations substitution and defects, strain and/or oxygen deficiency. C. A. Ross
et al. [Phys. Rev. Applied 7, 024006 (2017)] demonstrated the
SrTi$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$O$_{3-\delta}$ (STF) magnetization behavior for different
deposition oxygen-pressures, substrates and magnetic fields. The relation
between oxygen deficiency and ferroic orders is yet to be well understood, for
which the full potential of oxygen-stoichiometry engineered materials remain an
open question. Here, we use hybrid-DFT to calculate different oxygen vacancy
($v_{o}$) states in STF with a variety of TM distributions. The resulting
cations' magnetic states and alignments associated to the $v_{o}$ ground-states
for $x=\{0.125,0.25\}$ are used within a Monte Carlo scope for collinear
magnetism to simulate the spontaneous magnetization. Our model captures several
experimental STF features i.e., display a maximum of the magnetization at
intermediate number of vacancies, a monotonous quenching from
$\sim{0.35}\mu{_{B}}$ for small ${\delta}$, and a slower decreasing of such
saturation for larger number of vacancies. Moreover, our approach gives a
further insight into the relations between defects stabilization and
magnetization, vacancy density and the oxygen pressure required to maximize
such ferroic order, and sets guidelines for future Machine Learning based
computational synthesis of multiferroic oxides.

<h3>Dynamic behavior of elastic strips near shape transition</h3>

Elastic strips provide a canonical system for studying the mechanisms
governing elastic shape transitions. Buckling, linear snap-through, and
nonlinear snap-through have been observed in boundary-actuated strips and
linked to the type of bifurcation the strip undergoes at the transition. For
nonlinear snap-through, previous work obtained the normal form at the
bifurcation. However, to date, there is no methodology for extending this
analysis to other types of transition. Here, we study a set of three systems
where a buckled elastic strip is actuated through rotation of its boundaries.
Depending on the direction of rotation, the system exhibits all three types of
shape transitions. We introduce a simple method to analyse the dynamic
characteristics of an elastic structure near a transition. This method allows
us to extend, in a straightforward manner, the asymptotic analysis proposed for
nonlinear snap-through to the two other types of transition. We obtain the
normal forms of these bifurcations, and show how they dictate all the dynamic
characteristics of the elastic strip. This analysis provides a profound
understanding of the physical mechanisms governing elastic shape transitions
and reliable tools to diagnose and anticipate these transitions.

Energy functionals of the Green's function can provide simultaneously
spectral and thermodynamic properties of interacting electrons' systems.
Exploiting a localized-GW approach, we introduce an approximation to the
exchange-correlation part of the Klein functional that generalizes the energy
functional of DFT+U to host a dynamical screened potential $U(\omega)$.
Furthermore, we solve exactly the resulting Dyson equation extending to
crystals the algorithmic-inversion method. We then compute the spectral,
thermodynamic, and vibrational properties of SrVO$_3$, finding results in close
agreement with experiments and state-of-the-art computational methods, at very
reduced computational costs.

By means of a combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility and
specific heat study, we investigate the interplay between orthorhombic
distortion and stripe-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in the Mott insulator
BaCoS$_{2}$ at $T_N=290$ K. The data give evidence of a purely electronic AFM
transition with no participation of the lattice. The observation of large
thermal fluctuations in the vicinity of $T_N$ and a Schottky anomaly unveils
competing ground states within a minute $\sim$1 meV energy range that differ in
the orbital and spin configurations of the Co ions. This interpretation
suggests that the stripe-like order results from a spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the geometrically frustrated pristine tetragonal phase, which
offers an ideal playground to study the driving force of multi-orbital Mott
transitions without the participation of the lattice.

Studies of random unitary circuits have shown that the calculation of Renyi
entropies of entanglement can be mapped to classical statistical mechanics
problems in spacetime. In this paper, we develop an analogous spacetime picture
of entanglement generation for random free or weakly interacting fermion
systems without conservation laws. We first study a free-fermion model, namely
a 1D chain of Majorana modes with nearest neighbour hoppings, random in both
space and time. We analyze the Nth Renyi entropy of entanglement using a
replica formalism, and we show that the effective model is equivalent to an
SO(2N) Heisenberg spin chain evolving in imaginary time. By applying a
saddle-point approximation to the coherent states path integral for the N = 2
case, we arrive at a semiclassical picture for the dynamics of the entanglement
purity, in terms of two classical fields in spacetime. The classical solutions
involve a smooth domain wall that interpolates between two values, with this
domain wall relaxing diffusively in the time direction. We then study how
adding weak interactions to the free-fermion model modifies this spacetime
picture, reflecting a crossover from diffusive to ballistic spreading of
information.

The thermal conductivity of monolayer graphene is an outstanding challenge
with no consensus reached on its exact value and length convergence so far. We
consider four-phonon scattering, phonon renormalization, and an exact solution
to phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from first principles. Using this
computational formalism with unprecedented sampling grid, we show that when
four-phonon scattering is included the thermal conductivity is convergent with
system size at a room temperature value of 1300 W/(m$\cdot$K), which is lower
than that of diamond. On the contrary, considering three-phonon scattering only
yields divergence with size due to the momentum-conserving normal processes of
flexural phonons.

Thermocurrent flowing through a single-molecule device contains valuable
information about the quantum properties of the molecular structure and, in
particular, on its electronic and phononic excitation spectra, and entropy.
Furthermore, accessing the thermoelectric heat-to-charge conversion efficiency
experimentally can help to select suitable molecules for future energy
conversion devices, which - predicted by theoretical studies - could reach
unprecedented efficiencies. However, one of the major challenges in quantifying
thermocurrents in nanoscale devices is to determine the exact temperature bias
applied to the junction. In this work, we have incorporated a
superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) Josephson junction thermometer
into a single-molecule device. The critical current of the Josephson junction
depends accurately on minute changes of the electronic temperature in a wide
temperature range from 100 mK to 1.6 K. Thus, we present a device architecture
which can enable thermoelectric experiments on single molecules down to
millikelvin temperatures with high precision.

Charge density waves (CDWs) have been tied to a number of unusual phenomena
in kagome metals, including rotation symmetry breaking, time-reversal symmetry
breaking and superconductivity. The majority of the experiments thus far have
focused on the CDW states in AV3Sb5 and FeGe, characterized by the 2a0 by 2a0
period. Recently, a bulk CDW phase (T* ~ 92 K) with a different wave length and
orientation has been reported in ScV6Sn6, as the first realization of a CDW
state in the broad RM6X6 structure. Here, using a combination of scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, we reveal the microscopic structure and the spectroscopic
signatures of this charge ordering phase in ScV6Sn6. Differential conductance
dI/dV spectra show a partial gap opening in the density-of-states of about 20
meV at the Fermi level. This is much smaller than the spectral gaps observed in
AV3Sb5 and FeGe despite the comparable T* temperatures in these systems,
suggesting substantially weaker coupling strength in ScV6Sn6. Surprisingly,
despite the three-dimensional bulk nature of the charge order, we find that the
charge modulation is only observed on the kagome termination.
Temperature-dependent band structure evolution suggests a modulation of the
surface states as a consequence of the emergent charge order, with an abrupt
spectral weight shift below T* consistent with the first-order phase
transition. The similarity of the electronic band structures of ScV6Sn6 and
TbV6Sn6 (where charge ordering is absent), together with the first-principle
calculations, suggests that charge ordering in ScV6Sn6 may not be primarily
electronically driven. Interestingly, in contrast to the CDW state of cousin
AV3Sb5, we find no evidence supporting rotation symmetry breaking. Our results
reveal a distinctive nature of the charge ordering phase in ScV6Sn6 in
comparison to other kagome metals.
