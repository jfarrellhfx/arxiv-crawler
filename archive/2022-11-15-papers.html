<h3>Far-from-equilibrium universality in two-dimensional Heisenberg  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08392</a>

We study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of isolated two-dimensional
Heisenberg antiferromagnets. We consider spin spiral initial conditions which
imprint a position-dependent staggered-magnetization (or Neel order) in the
two-dimensional lattice. Remarkably, we find a long-lived prethermal regime
characterized by self-similar behavior of staggered magnetization fluctuations,
although the system has no long-range order at finite energy and the staggered
magnetization does not couple with conserved charges. Exploiting the separation
of length scales introduced by the initial condition, we derive a simplified
analytical model that allow us to compute the spatial-temporal scaling
exponents and power-law distribution of the staggered magnetization
fluctuations analytically, and find excellent agreement with numerical
simulations using phase space methods. The scaling exponents are insensitive to
details of the initial condition, in particular, no fine-tuning of energy is
required to trigger the self-similar scaling regime. Compared with recent
results on far-from-equilibrium universality on the Heisenberg ferromagnet, we
find quantitatively distinct spatial-temporal scaling exponents, therefore
suggesting that the same model with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic initial
conditions can host different universal regimes. Our predictions are relevant
to ultra-cold atoms simulators of Heisenberg magnets and driven
antiferromagnetic insulators.

<h3>Coactive-Staggered Feature in Weyl Materials for Enhancing the Anomalous  Nernst Conductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07773</a>
<br>
<i>Vsevolod Ivanov, Ella Banyas, Liang Z. Tan</i>

Power generation through the anomalous Nernst effect in topological Weyl
materials has several advantages over conventional thermoelectrics due to the
transverse geometry. However, the magnitude of the anomalous Nernst
conductivity (ANC) in most known materials is too small to be of practical use,
and there exist few guiding principles for finding materials with optimal
thermoelectric properties. This work shows that the ANC is maximal when there
is a ``coactive-staggered" feature in the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). It
is shown that a minimal arrangement of two Weyl pairs leads to such a feature,
and tuning the separations between the pairs controls the temperature at which
the ANC is maximal. Several methods are proposed for creating such arrangements
of Weyl points starting from Dirac semimetal materials. It is also demonstrated
how an existing coactive-staggered AHC in a Heusler material can be exploited,
by collectively tuning the positions of the Weyl points through strain to
further enhance the ANC. A modest 20% amplification of the ANC is achieved,
even with relatively minor changes in Weyl point positions.

Sperm swimming is crucial to fertilise the egg, in nature and in assisted
reproductive technologies. Modelling the sperm dynamics involves elasticity,
hydrodynamics, internal active forces, and out-of-equilibrium noise. Here we
demonstrate experimentally the relevance of energy dissipation for sperm
beating fluctuations. For each motile cell, we reconstruct the time-evolution
of the two main tail's spatial modes, which together trace a noisy limit cycle
characterised by a maximum level of precision $p_{max}$. Our results indicate
$p_{max} \sim 10^2 s^{-1}$, remarkably close to the estimated precision of a
dynein molecular motor actuating the flagellum, which is bounded by its energy
dissipation rate according to the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation. Further
experiments under oxygen deprivation show that $p_{max}$ decays with energy
consumption, as it occurs for a single molecular motor. Both observations can
be explained by conjecturing a high level of coordination among the
conformational changes of dynein motors. This conjecture is supported by a
theoretical model for the beating of an ideal flagellum actuated by a
collection of motors, including a motor-motor nearest neighbour coupling of
strength $K$: when $K$ is small the precision of a large flagellum is much
higher than the single motor one. On the contrary, when $K$ is large the two
become comparable.

<h3>Impact of junction length on supercurrent resilience against magnetic  field in InSb-Al nanowire Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
Semiconducting nanowire Josephson junctions represent an attractive platform
to investigate the anomalous Josephson effect and detect topological
superconductivity by studying Josephson supercurrent. However, an external
magnetic field generally suppresses the supercurrent through hybrid nanowire
junctions and significantly limits the field range in which the supercurrent
phenomena can be studied. In this work, we investigate the impact of the length
of InSb-Al nanowire Josephson junctions on the supercurrent resilience against
magnetic fields. We find that the critical parallel field of the supercurrent
can be considerably enhanced by reducing the junction length. Particularly, in
30 nm-long junctions supercurrent can persist up to 1.3 T parallel field -
approaching the critical field of the superconducting film. Furthermore, we
embed such short junctions into a superconducting loop and obtain the
supercurrent interference at a parallel field of 1 T. Our findings are highly
relevant for multiple experiments on hybrid nanowires requiring a magnetic
field-resilient supercurrent.

<h3>ET-AL: Entropy-Targeted Active Learning for Bias Mitigation in Materials  Data</h3>

Growing materials data and data-centric informatics tools drastically promote
the discovery and design of materials. While data-driven models, such as
machine learning, have drawn much attention and observed significant progress,
the quality of data resources is equally important but less studied. In this
work, we focus on bias mitigation, an important aspect of materials data
quality. Quantifying the diversity of stability in different crystal systems,
we propose a metric for measuring structure-stability bias in materials data.
To mitigate the bias, we develop an entropy-target active learning (ET-AL)
framework, guiding the acquisition of new data so that diversities of
underrepresented crystal systems are improved, thus mitigating the bias. With
experiments on materials datasets, we demonstrate the capability of ET-AL and
the improvement in machine learning models that mitigating bias offers through
bias mitigation. The approach is applicable to data-centric informatics in
other scientific domains.

The conversion of natural gas (methane) to ethane and ethylene (OCM:
oxidative coupling of methane) facilitates its transportation and provides a
way to synthesize higher value chemicals. The search for high-performance
catalysts to achieve this conversion is the main scope of most corresponding
studies in the field of OCM. Here, we present a general data-driven strategy
for the search of novel catalytic materials, focusing particularly on materials
useful for the OCM reaction. Our strategy is based on consistent experimental
measurements and includes ab initio thermodynamics calculations and active
screening. Based on our experiments, which showed unique volcano-type
dependence of the performance on the stability of formed carbonates attributed
to the site isolation concept, we developed a method for efficient and
inexpensive DFT calculations of the formation energies of carbonates with
prediction accuracy 0.2 eV. This method was implemented into a high-throughput
screening scheme, which includes both general requirements for catalyst
candidates and an actively done artificial intelligence part. Experimental
validation of some of the candidates obtained during the screening showed
successful reproduction of the initial volcano dependence. Moreover, several
new materials were found to outperform standard OCM catalysts, specifically at
lower temperatures.

<h3>Artificial intelligence approaches for materials-by-design of energetic  materials: state-of-the-art, challenges, and future directions</h3>

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as an enabling tool for
solving various complex materials design problems. This paper aims to review
recent advances in AI-driven materials-by-design and their applications to
energetic materials (EM). Trained with data from numerical simulations and/or
physical experiments, AI models can assimilate trends and patterns within the
design parameter space, identify optimal material designs (micro-morphologies,
combinations of materials in composites, etc.), and point to designs with
superior/targeted property and performance metrics. We review approaches
focusing on such capabilities with respect to the three main stages of
materials-by-design, namely representation learning of microstructure
morphology (i.e., shape descriptors), structure-property-performance (S-P-P)
linkage estimation, and optimization/design exploration. We provide a
perspective view of these methods in terms of their potential, practicality,
and efficacy towards the realization of materials-by-design. Specifically,
methods in the literature are evaluated in terms of their capacity to learn
from a small/limited number of data, computational complexity,
generalizability/scalability to other material species and operating
conditions, interpretability of the model predictions, and the burden of
supervision/data annotation. Finally, we suggest a few promising future
research directions for EM materials-by-design, such as meta-learning, active
learning, Bayesian learning, and semi-/weakly-supervised learning, to bridge
the gap between machine learning research and EM research.

<h3>Ultrafast crystallization and sintering of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass  and its impact on ion conduction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) is among the most promising solid electrolytes
for the next generation all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, preparing
LAGP electrolytes is timeand energy-intensive. In this work, LAGP glassy
powders were sintered and crystallized in 180 seconds by ultrafast
high-temperature sintering (UHS) under conditions attractive for continuous
industrial processes (i.e., ambient pressure and atmosphere). The fast heating
rates characteristic of UHS significantly delay crystallization, potentially
decoupling crystallization and sintering. Furthermore, EIS characterizations
reveal that LAGP sintered and crystallized by UHS has an ionic conductivity of
1.15 10-4 S/cm, slightly lower than conventionally annealed samples (1.75 10-4
S/cm). The lower conductivity can be attributed to poorer intergrain contact.
To overcome this issue, additives such as B2O3 and Li3BO3 are used, resulting
in 2 and 5 times higher grain boundary conductivity for LAGP+1 wt B2O3 and
LAGP+1 wt Li3BO3, respectively, compared to LAGP. Overall, this work provides
insights into unraveling the impact of UHS sintering on the LAGP Li+ conduction
mechanism.

<h3>The Many Faces of Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations Out of Equilibrium</h3>

In this paper, we offer to the reader an essential review of the theory of
Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations (FDR), from the first formulations due to
Einstein and Onsager, to the recent developments in the framework of stochastic
thermodynamics of non-equilibrium system. We focus on two general approaches,
somehow complementary, where out-of-equilibrium contributions to the FDR are
expressed in terms of different quantities, related either to the stationary
distribution or to the transition rates of the system. In particular, we
discuss applications of the FDR in the general field of causation and
inference, and in the contexts of non-equilibrium systems, such as spin models,
granular media and active matter.

<h3>Probing octupolar hidden order via impurity-induced strain</h3>

Quantum materials with non-Kramers doublets are a fascinating venue to
realize novel multipolar broken symmetries. Impurities which break point group
symmetries and lift the non-Kramers degeneracy have a Janus-faced influence in
such systems, since they can be used to both seek and destroy the multipolar
orders. In this work, we explore impurity effects in the cubic osmate double
perovskites which are candidates for hosting exotic $d$-orbital ferro-octupolar
order. For ideal Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ our $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations show
stable phonon modes, signalling the stability of the $Fm\bar{3}m$ structure
against spontaneous lattice distortions. Upon partial substitution of Ca$^{2+}$
with Na$^+$ or Sr$^{2+}$, our computations reveal local strains which break the
octahedral point group symmetry around neighboring Os sites. Using Landau
theory and Monte Carlo simulations, such strains are shown to locally pin
quadrupoles on Os, exerting transverse clock fields on the octupoles and
suppressing $T_c$ with increasing impurity concentration. Strains also mix the
Os non-Kramers doublet with the excited magnetic triplet, nucleating parasitic
dipole moments below $T_c$ which track the underlying octupolar order. Our work
explains recent $^{23}$Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on
Ba$_2$Ca$_{1-\delta}$Na$_\delta$OsO$_6$, and holds broader lessons for
multipolar magnetism.

Bosonic atoms deposited on atomically thin substrates represent a playground
for exotic quantum many-body physics due to the highly-tunable, atomic-scale
nature of the interaction potentials. The ability to engineer strong
interparticle interactions can lead to the emergence of complex collective
atomic states of matter, not possible in the context of dilute atomic gases
confined in optical lattices. While it is known that the first layer of
adsorbed helium on graphene is permanently locked into a solid phase, we show
by a combination of quantum Monte Carlo and mean-field techniques, that simple
isotropic graphene lattice expansion effectively unlocks a large variety of
two-dimensional ordered commensurate, incommensurate, cluster atomic solid, and
superfluid states for adsorbed atoms. It is especially significant that an
atomically thin superfluid phase of matter emerges under experimentally
feasible strain values, with potentially supersolid phases in close proximity
on the phase diagram.

In this work, we put forward that Dirac materials are ideal candidates for
observing the quantization of the superfluid stiffness. To show this, we
re-formulate the theory of superfluid transport in terms of a response to
gradients of the superconducting phase, and find that the superfluid stiffness
is related to a synthetic Berry curvature. Our approach provides a transparent
explanation for the puzzling prediction of quantized superfluid stiffness in
short graphene Josephson junctions and superconducting bulk graphene. As we
demonstrate, this quantization can be attributed to the realization of chiral
anomaly, and we reveal that it remains robust upon adding nonuniform strain.
Finally, we predict that signatures of chiral anomaly can be detected in the
quantum capacitance of a Josephson junction consisting of a strained graphene
hybrid and a conventional superconductor.

Confining materials to two-dimensional forms changes the behavior of
electrons and enables new devices. However, most materials are challenging to
produce as uniform thin crystals. We present a new synthesis approach where
crystals are grown in a nanoscale mold defined by atomically-flat van der Waals
(vdW) materials. By heating and compressing bismuth in a vdW mold made of
hexagonal boron nitride, we produce ultrathin crystals less than 10 nanometers
thick with flat surfaces. Cryogenic measurements of the ultrathin bismuth
demonstrate high-quality electronic transport exhibiting quantum oscillations
and a 10x larger residual resistance ratio compared to thin films grown by
molecular beam epitaxy. Our vdW mold-growth technique enables intrinsic
transport studies of ultrathin bismuth, and also holds promise to achieve
two-dimensional bismuthene, a large-gap 2D topological insulator. Beyond
bismuth, this approach provides a general way to synthesize ultrathin forms of
non-vdW materials that are directly integrated into a vdW heterostructure.

Elucidating the atomic structure of liquid and glass is one of the important
open questions in condensed matter physics. In the conventional bottom-up
approach one starts with focusing on an atom and the short-range order of its
neighboring atoms, and the global structure is described in terms of
overlapping local clusters of atoms as building units. However, this local
approach fails to explain the strong drive to form the medium-range order which
is distinct in nature from the short-range order. We propose an even-handed
scheme with an additional top-down approach. In the top-down approach one
starts with a high-density gas state and seeks to minimize the global potential
energy through density waves. The local bottom-up and global top-down driving
forces are not compatible, and the competition and compromise between them
result in a final structure with the medium-range order. The density waves are
pinned to atoms through the phase factors and amplitudes which reflect atomic
dynamics. This even-handed approach provides a more intuitive explanation of
the structure of simple liquid and glass and its relation to properties of
liquid, such as viscosity and fragility.

Understanding the rich physics of magnetization dynamics in perpendicular
synthetic antiferromagnets (p-SAFs) is crucial for developing next-generation
spintronic devices. In this work, we systematically investigate the
magnetization dynamics in p-SAFs combining time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr
effect (TR-MOKE) measurements with theoretical modeling. These model analyses,
based on a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert approach incorporating exchange coupling,
provide details about the magnetization dynamic characteristics including the
amplitudes, directions, and phases of the precession of p-SAFs under varying
magnetic fields. These model-predicted characteristics are in excellent
quantitative agreement with TR-MOKE measurements on an asymmetric p-SAF. We
further reveal the damping mechanisms of two procession modes co-existing in
the p-SAF and successfully identify individual contributions from different
sources, including Gilbert damping of each ferromagnetic layer, spin pumping,
and inhomogeneous broadening. Such a comprehensive understanding of
magnetization dynamics in p-SAFs, obtained by integrating high-fidelity TR-MOKE
measurements and theoretical modeling, can guide the design of p-SAF-based
architectures for spintronic applications.

<br>
<br>
The conventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state relies on the
Zeeman effect of an external magnetic field to break time-reversal symmetry,
forming a state of finite-momentum Cooper pairing. In superconductors with
broken inversion symmetries, the Rashba or Ising-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
can interact with either the Zeeman or the orbital effect of magnetic fields,
extending the range of possible FFLO states, though evidence for these more
exotic forms of FFLO pairing has been lacking. Here we report the discovery of
an unconventional FFLO state induced by coupling the Ising SOC and the orbital
effect in multilayer 2H-NbSe2. Transport measurements show that the
translational and rotational symmetries are broken in the orbital FFLO state,
providing the hallmark signatures of finite momentum cooper pairings. We
establish the entire orbital FFLO phase diagram, consisting of normal metal,
uniform Ising superconducting phase, and a six-fold orbital FFLO state. This
study highlights an alternative route to finite-momentum superconductivity and
provides a universal mechanism to prepare orbital FFLO states in similar
materials with broken inversion symmetries.

We show that neural quantum states based on very deep (4--16-layered) neural
networks can outperform state-of-the-art variational approaches on highly
frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum-spin-liquid candidates. We focus
on group convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) that allow us to impose
space-group symmetries on our ans\"atze. We achieve state-of-the-art
ground-state energies for the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg models on the square and
triangular lattices, in both ordered and spin-liquid phases, and discuss ways
to access low-lying excited states in nontrivial symmetry sectors. We also
compute spin and dimer correlation functions for the quantum paramagnetic phase
on the triangular lattice, which do not indicate either conventional or
valence-bond ordering.

The focus is on discrete defects that can be modeled by continuum mechanics,
but where the discreteness of the carriers of plastic deformation plays a
significant role. The formulations are restricted to small deformation
kinematics and the defects considered, dislocations and discrete shear
transformation zones (STZs), are described by their linear elastic fields. In
discrete defect plasticity both the stress-strain response and the partitioning
between defect energy storage and defect dissipation are outcomes of an
initial/boundary value problem solution. Discrete dislocation plasticity
modeling results are reviewed that illustrate the implications of defect
dissipation evolution for friction, fatigue crack growth and thermal softening.
Examples are also given of consequences of three modes of the evolution of
discrete defects for size dependence and dissipation in constrained shear. The
requirement that the dissipation rate is non-negative, which is a
specialization of the Clausius-Duhem inequality for a purely mechanical
formulation, imposes restrictions on kinetic relations for the evolution of
discrete defects. Explicit kinetic relations for discrete dislocation
plasticity dissipation and for discrete STZ plasticity dissipation identify
conditions that can lead to a negative dissipation rate. The statistical
mechanics form of the second law allows the Clausius-Duhem inequality to be
violated for a sufficiently small number of discrete events for a short time
period. In continuum mechanics, at least in some circumstances, satisfaction of
the Clausius-Duhem inequality can be regarded as a requirement for stability.
One dimensional continuum calculations illustrate that there can be a negative
dissipation rate over a short distance and for a short time period with overall
stability maintained. Implications for discrete defect plasticity modeling are
briefly discussed.

<h3>Spin-statistics relation for abelian quantum Hall states</h3>

We prove a generic spin-statistics relation for the fractional quasiparticles
that appear in abelian quantum Hall states on the disk. The proof is based on
an efficient way for computing the Berry phase acquired by a generic
quasiparticle translated in the plane along a circular path, and on the crucial
fact that once the gauge-invariant generator of rotations is projected onto a
Landau level, it fractionalizes among the quasiparticles and the edge. Using
these results we define a measurable quasiparticle fractional spin that
satisfies the spin-statistics relation. As an application, we predict the value
of the spin of the composite-fermion quasielectron proposed by Jain; our
numerical simulations agree with that value. We also show that Laughlin's
quasielectrons satisfy the spin-statistics relation, but carry the wrong spin
to be the anti-anyons of Laughlin's quasiholes. We conclude highlighting the
fact that the statistical angle between two quasiparticles can be obtained by
measuring the angular momentum whilst merging the two quasiparticles.

Durable interest in developing a framework for the detailed structure of
glassy materials has produced numerous structural descriptors that trade off
between general applicability and interpretability. However, none approach the
combination of simplicity and wide-ranging predictive power of the
lattice-grain-defect framework for crystalline materials. Working from the
hypothesis that the local atomic environments of a glassy material are
constrained by enthalpy minimization to a low-dimensional manifold in atomic
coordinate space, we develop a novel generalized distance function, the
Gaussian Integral Inner Product (GIIP) distance, in connection with
agglomerative clustering and diffusion maps, to parameterize that manifold.
Applying this approach to a two-dimensional model crystal and a
three-dimensional binary model metallic glass results in parameters
interpretable as coordination number, composition, volumetric strain, and local
symmetry. In particular, we show that a more slowly quenched glass has a higher
degree of local tetrahedral symmetry at the expense of cyclic symmetry. While
these descriptors require post-hoc interpretation, they minimize bias rooted in
crystalline materials science and illuminate a range of structural trends that
might otherwise be missed.

<h3>Degeneracy removal of spin bands in antiferromagnets with  non-interconvertible spin motif pair</h3>

<br>
<br>
Energy bands in antiferromagnets are generally spin degenerate in the absence
of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Recent studies [Physical Review B 102, 014422
(2020)] identified formal symmetry conditions for crystals for which this
degeneracy can be lifted even in the zero SOC limit. Such materials could
enable "spin-split" antiferromagnetic spintronics without the burden of use of
heavy atom compounds. Here, we show that these formal symmetry conditions can
be interpreted in terms of easy-to-visualize local motif pair, such as
octahedra or tetrahedra, each carrying opposite magnetic moments. Collinear
antiferromagnets with such spin motif pair whose components interconvert by
neither translation nor spatial inversion will show splitting of spin bands.
Such real-space motif-based approach enables an easy way to identify and design
of materials having spin splitting without the need for spin orbit coupling,
and offers insights on the magnitude of spin splitting.

Transition metal halides can host a large variety of novel phenomena, such as
magnetism in the monolayer limit, quantum spin liquid and spiral spin liquid
states, and topological magnons and phonons. Sizeable high quality single
crystals are necessary for investigations of magnetic and lattice excitations
by, for example, inelastic neutron scattering. In this paper, we review a less
well-known vapor transport technique, self-selecting vapor growth, and report
our growths of transition metal halides using this technique. We report the
growth and characterizations of sizable single crystals of RuCl$_3$, CrCl$_3$,
Ru$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$Cl$_3$, and CrBr$_3$. In order to expedite the conversion of
starting powder to single crystals, we modified the technique by cooling the
growth ampoule through an appropriate temperature range. Our work shows that
the self-selecting vapor transport technique can provide large single crystals
of transition metal halides, demonstrating its potential for providing high
quality single crystals of quantum materials.

<h3>Mpemba Effect in Crystallization of Polybutene-1</h3>

The Mpemba effect and its inverse can be understood as a result of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. In polymers, the changes of states generally
undergo the process of non-equilibrium and even beyond equilibrium. However,
the Mpemba effect has been seldom reported in crystallization of polymers. As a
strong polymer in melt with the lowest critical cooling rate in polyolefins,
polybutylene-1 (PB-1) tends to maintain its original structure and property
with thermal history. Experimentally, a clear Mpemba effect in crystallization
of nascent PB-1 melt is observed, by the differences in the chain conformation
entropy settling in the lattice or the relaxation time for the chain
conformation adjusting. The entropy and the relaxation time predicted from the
Adam-Gibbs equations, whereas non-equilibrium thermodynamics is required if the
crystallization with the Mpemba effect.

<h3>Enhanced piezoelectric response of AlN via alloying of transitional  metals, and influence of type and distribution of transition metals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Aluminum nitride (AlN) is an important piezoelectric material for a wide
range of applications, many efforts are devoted to improving its piezoelectric
response by alloying with transition metals (TMs). In this paper, the influence
of the type and distribution of TM on the piezoelectric response is discussed
for the first time. TM0.0625Al0.9375N with twenty-eight different TMs are
investigated, and most show higher values of piezoelectric strain modulus d33
than that of AlN. This is because the TM introduces weaker TM-N bonds and
locates closer to the centre of three neighbouring N atoms. The location of TM
is determined to be significantly correlated with its group number. Alloys of
TMxAl1-xN (TM=Sc, Cr, Sr, Mo, Ru and Rh) with varying x are further studied. On
basis of the cost of the TMs and piezoelectric performances, the alloy with Mo
is more effective in enhancing d33. A high d33 of 12.3 times that of pure AlN
is realized in a metastable configuration of Mo0.167Al0.833N. The distribution
of Mo plays a key role in the piezoelectric performance. A higher d33 is more
likely to appear in MoxAl1-xN with more Al sublayers containing Mo atoms and
with fewer dimers of Mo atoms along the z-axis.

<h3>Accelerating self-consistent field iterations in Kohn-Sham density  functional theory using a low rank approximation of the dielectric matrix</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07894</a>
<br>
<i>Sambit Das, Vikram Gavini</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an efficient preconditioning technique for accelerating the fixed
point iteration in real-space Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The preconditioner uses a low rank approximation of the
dielectric matrix (LRDM) based on G\^ateaux derivatives of the residual of
fixed point iteration along appropriately chosen direction functions. We
develop a computationally efficient method to evaluate these G\^ateaux
derivatives in conjunction with the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration
procedure, an approach widely used in large-scale Kohn-Sham DFT calculations.
Further, we propose a variant of LRDM preconditioner based on adaptive
accumulation of low-rank approximations from previous SCF iterations, and also
extend the LRDM preconditioner to spin-polarized Kohn-Sham DFT calculations. We
demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the LRDM preconditioner against
other widely used preconditioners on a range of benchmark systems with sizes
ranging from $\sim$ 100-1100 atoms ($\sim$ 500--20,000 electrons). The
benchmark systems include various combinations of
metal-insulating-semiconducting heterogeneous material systems, nanoparticles
with localized $d$ orbitals near the Fermi energy, nanofilm with metal dopants,
and magnetic systems. In all benchmark systems, the LRDM preconditioner
converges robustly within 20--30 iterations. In contrast, other widely used
preconditioners show slow convergence in many cases, as well as divergence of
the fixed point iteration in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate the
computational efficiency afforded by the LRDM method, with up to 3.4$\times$
reduction in computational cost for the total ground-state calculation compared
to other preconditioners.

<h3>Electron paramagnetic resonance of n-type silicon and germanium for  applications in 3D thermometry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07895</a>

<br>
<br>
While several 2D thermometry techniques, there is a lack of 3D thermometry
techniques that work for a wide range of materials and offer good resolution in
time, space and temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) imaging can provide 3D temperature information. However, XRD is
typically limited to crystalline materials while NMR is largely limited to
liquids where the resonance lines are sufficiently narrow. We investigate
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of n-type silicon and germanium for 3D
thermometry. While in germanium the EPR linewidths are too broad, EPR
linewidths in silicon are reasonably narrow and exhibit a strong temperature
dependence. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate
(1/T1) of conduction electrons in n-type Si for low dopant concentrations
follows a T^3 law due to phonon broadening. For heavily doped Si, which is
desirable for good signal to noise ratio (SNR) for application in thermometry,
impurity scattering is expected to decrease the temperature dependence of 1/T1.
Our results show, in heavily doped n-type Si, spin-lattice relaxation induced
by impurity scattering does not drastically decrease the temperature dependence
of EPR linewidths. In P-doped Si with donor concentration of 7 x 10^18 /cm^3,
the EPR linewidth has a T^(5/2) temperature dependence; the temperature
dependence decreases to T^(3/2) when the donor concentration is 7
x 10^19 /cm^3. While the temperature dependence of linewidth decreases for
heavier doping, EPR linewidth is still a sensitive thermometer. We define a
figure of merit for SNR for thermometry from EPR linewidths of n-type Si and
observe that increasing the doping results in a better SNR. Using effective
medium theory, we show that EPR linewidth can be a sensitive thermometer for
application in 3D thermometry with systems embedding microparticles of heavily
doped n-type Si.

<h3>Fick-Jacobs description and first passage dynamics for diffusion in a  channel under stochastic resetting</h3>

Transport of particles through channels is of paramount importance in
physics, chemistry and surface science due to its broad real world
applications. Much insights can be gained by observing the transition paths of
a particle through a channel and collecting statistics on the lifetimes in the
channel or the escape probabilities from the channel. In this paper, we
consider the diffusive transport through a narrow conical channel of a Brownian
particle subject to intermittent dynamics, namely, stochastic resetting. As
such, resetting brings the particle back to a desired location from where it
resumes its diffusive phase. To this end, we extend the Fick-Jacobs theory of
channel-facilitated diffusive transport to resetting-induced transport. Exact
expressions for the conditional mean first passage times, escape probabilities
and the total average lifetime in the channel are obtained, and their behaviour
as a function of the resetting rate are highlighted. It is shown that resetting
can expedite the transport through the channel -- rigorous constraints for such
conditions are then illustrated. Furthermore, we observe that a carefully
chosen resetting rate can render the average lifetime of the particle inside
the channel minimal. Interestingly, the optimal rate undergoes continuous and
discontinuous transitions as some relevant system parameters are varied. The
validity of our one-dimensional analysis and the corresponding theoretical
predictions are supported by three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations.
We thus believe that resetting can be useful to facilitate particle transport
across biological membranes -- a phenomena that can spearhead further
theoretical and experimental studies.

<h3>Thermal Transport of Fractionalized Antiferromagnetic and Field Induced  States in the Kitaev Material Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report an in-plane thermal transport study of the honeycomb Kitaev
material Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ at subKelvin temperatures. In zero field, the
$\kappa(T)$ displays a rather weak $T$-dependence but has a non-zero residual
term $\kappa_0/T$, indicating strong phonon scattering by magnetic excitation
and the possibility of itinerant spinon-like excitations coexisting with an
antiferromagnetic order below 27 K. We propose the zero-field ground state is a
novel fractionalized antiferromagnetic (AF*) state with both magnetic order and
fractionalized excitations. With both the heat current and external field along
the $a*$ (Co-Co bond) direction, the $\kappa_{a*}$ exhibits two sharp minima at
7.5 T and 10 T, and its value at 8.5 T is almost the same as the pure phononic
transport for the high-field polarized state. This confirms the phase
boundaries of the reported field-induced intermediate state and suggest its
gapless continuum excitations possibly transport heat. No such intermediate
phase was found in the $\kappa_a$ for the current and field along the $a$
(zigzag chain) direction. Finally, Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ displays a strongly
anisotropic magneto-thermal conductivity since the in-plane (out-of-plane)
field strongly enhances (suppresses) the $\kappa_{a*}$ and $\kappa_a$.

The dynamic balance between pair creation and annihilation processes takes a
crucial role to the topological superconductivity in Kitaev model. Here we
study the effect of spatial separation of creation and annihilation terms,
i.e., sources and drains of pair are arranged alternatively. In this regard, a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is naturally considered, which may possess complex
energy branches. However, when the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pair (BCS)-like
pair excitation is only considered, the spectrum in such a subspace is fully
real. In particular, the Zak phases extracted from the pair wave function are
quantized and therefore able to characterize the different phases regardless of
the breaking of time reversal symmetry. For open chain system, the
corresponding Majorana lattice is investigated. We find that although there are
complex modes, all the edge modes have zero energy and obey the bulk-boundary
correspondence. This results in the Kramerlike degeneracy of both the real and
complex levels as a signature of the topologically non-trivial phase.

Geometric aspects of physics play a crucial role in modern condensed matter
physics. The quantum metric is one of these geometric quantities which defines
the distance on a parameter space. In free systems, relationships between the
metric and the topological invariant have been reported in recent studies. In
this paper, we introduce a generalized quantum metric(GQM) on the Brillouin
zone for correlated electron systems. This quantum metric is based on the
optical conductivity that is written by single-particle Green's functions. We
analytically prove that this definition is equivalent to the existing
definition of the quantum metric in free systems and that it is positive
semi-definite as necessary for a metric. We then calculate the GQM in a
correlated Qi-Wu-Zhang model. We demonstrate that the GQM can detect the
topological phase transition in this model by showing that the GQM is larger in
the topological phase than in the trivial phase, similar to the free system.
Thus, the GQM can serve as a probe to detect the topology in a general lattice
model.

We have studied the Mott insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) and concomitant
evolution of structural properties under high pressure in the van der Waals
compound CoPS$_3$ through \textit{in-situ} electrical resistance, Hall effect,
magnetoresistance, X-ray diffraction, and Raman scattering measurements.
CoPS$_3$, a native antiferromagnet at 122 K under ambient conditions, exhibits
an IMT at 7 GPa, coinciding with a $C2/m$ $\rightarrow$ $P\overline{3}$
structural transformation and a 2.4$\%$ reduction in the volume per formula
unit, indicative of a Mott transition. This metallic CoPS$_3$ observed under
high pressure is a hole-dominant conductor with multiple conduction bands. The
linear magnetoresistance (LMR), as well as the small volume collapse at the
IMT, suggests the incomplete high-spin $\rightarrow$ low-spin transition in the
metallic phase. Thus, the metallic CoPS$_3$ may possess an inhomogeneous
magnetic moment distribution and short-range magnetic ordering (SRO). By
revealing the high-pressure phase and electrical transport property of
CoPS$_3$, this report summarizes the comprehensive phase diagram of $M$PS$_3$
($M$ = V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cd) that metalize via Mott transition.

When channels were scaled down to the size of hydrated ions, ionic Coulomb
blockade was discovered. However, the experimental CB phenomenon was rarely
reported since Feng et.al., discovered in MoS2 nanopore. By using latent-track
membranes with diameter of 0.6 nm, we found the channels are nearly
non-conductive in small voltage due to the blockade of cations bound at
surface, however turns to be conductive as rising of voltage due to releasing
of bound ions, which differs from the mechanisms in MoS2 nanopore. By Kramers'
escape framework, we rationalized an analytical equation to fit experimental
results, uncovering new fundamental insights of ion transport in the smallest
channels.

We study transport along interfaced edge segments of fractional quantum Hall
states hosting non-Abelian Majorana modes. With an incoherent model approach,
we compute, for edge segments based on Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian, and
particle-hole-Pfaffian topological orders, thermal conductances, voltage biased
noise, and delta-$T$ noise. We determine how the thermal equilibration of edge
modes impacts these observables and identify the temperature scalings of
transitions between regimes of differently quantized thermal conductances. In
combination with recent experimental data, we use our results to estimate
thermal and charge equilibration lengths in real devices. We also propose an
experimental setup which permits measuring several transport observables for
interfaced fractional quantum Hall edges in a single device. It can, e.g., be
used to rule out edge reconstruction effects. In this context, we further point
out some subtleties in two-terminal thermal conductance measurements and how to
remedy them. Our findings are consistent with recent experimental results
pointing towards a particle-hole-Pfaffian topological order at filling
$\nu=5/2$ in GaAs/AlGaAs, and provide further means to pin-point the edge
structure at this filling and possibly also other exotic fractional quantum
Hall states.

We propose a mean-field theory for nonequilibrium phase transitions to a
periodically oscillating state in spin models. A nonequilibrium generalization
of the Landau free energy is obtained from the join distribution of the
magnetization and its smoothed stochastic time derivative. The order parameter
of the transition is a Hamiltonian, whose nonzero value signals the onset of
oscillations. The Hamiltonian and the nonequilibrium Landau free energy are
determined explicitly from the stochastic spin dynamics. The oscillating phase
is also characterized by a non-trivial overlap distribution reminiscent of a
continuous replica symmetry breaking, in spite of the absence of disorder. An
illustration is given on an explicit kinetic mean-field spin model.

Using a general framework, interaction potentials between chiral magnetic
solitons in a planar system with a tilted external magnetic field are
calculated analytically in the limit of large separation. The results are
compared to previous numerical results for solitons with topological charge
$\pm 1$. A key feature of the calculation is the interpretation of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as a background $SO(3)$ gauge field. In
a tilted field, this leads to a $U(1)$-gauged version of the usual equation for
spin excitations, leading to a distinctive oscillating interaction profile. We
also obtain predictions for skyrmion stability in a tilted field which closely
match numerical observations.

We analyze, both experimentally and numerically, the nonlinear regime of the
photo-induced coherent magnetization dynamics in cobalt-doped yttrium iron
garnet films. Photo-magnetic excitation with femtosecond laser pulses reveals a
strongly nonlinear response of the spin subsystem with a significant increase
of the effective Gilbert damping. By varying both laser fluence and the
external magnetic field, we show that this nonlinearity originates in the
anharmonicity of the magnetic energy landscape. We numerically map the
parameter workspace for the nonlinear photo-induced spin dynamics below the
photo-magnetic switching threshold. Corroborated by numerical simulations of
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, our results highlight the key role of the
cubic symmetry of the magnetic subsystem in reaching the nonlinear spin
precession regime. These findings expand the fundamental understanding of
laser-induced nonlinear spin dynamics as well as facilitate the development of
applied photo-magnetism.

With the development of novel computing schemes working at cryogenic
temperatures, superconducting memory elements have become essential. In this
context, superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are promising
candidates, as they may trap different discrete amounts of magnetic flux. We
demonstrate that a field-assisted writing scheme allows such a device to
operate as a multilevel memory by the readout of eight distinct vorticity
states at zero magnetic field. We present an alternative mechanism based on
single phase slips which allows to switch the vorticity state while preserving
superconductivity. This mechanism provides a possibly deterministic channel for
flux control in SQUID-based memories, under the condition that the
field-dependent energy of different vorticity states are nearby.

Despite significant potential as energy storage materials for electric
vehicles due to their combination of high energy density per unit cost and
reduced environmental and ethical concerns, Co-free lithium ion batteries based
off layered Mn oxides presently lack the longevity and stability of their
Co-containing counterparts. Here, we demonstrate a reduction in this
performance gap via chemical doping, with Li$_{1.1}$Ni$_{0.35}$Mn$_{0.55}$O$_2$
achieving an initial discharge capacity of 159 mAhg$^{-1}$ at C/3 rate and a
corresponding capacity retention of 94.3% after 150 cycles. We subsequently
explore the nanoscale origins of this improvement through a combination of
advanced diffraction, spectroscopy, and electron microscopy techniques, finding
that optimized doping profiles lead to an improved structural and chemical
compatibility between the two constituent sub-phases that characterize the
layered Mn oxide system, resulting in the formation of unobstructed lithium ion
pathways between them. We also directly observe a structural stabilization
effect of the host compound near the surface using aberration corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy and integrated differential phase
contrast imaging.

investigate the crystallographic, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of
gas-atomized particles of the intermetallic compound ErCo$_{2}$, a giant
magnetocaloric material for low-temperature applications. The results
demonstrate that the physical properties of ErCo$_{2}$ are significantly
changed by atomization and subsequent thermal annealing. In the as-atomized
particles, the magnetic transition temperature increases from 34 to 56 K and
the phase transition changes from first order to second order. The thermal
annealing shifts the transition temperature back to the original one and
restores the first-order phase transition characteristic. The changes in
magnetic properties are closely related to those in crystallographic
properties, suggesting the importance of the magneto-structural coupling. The
magnetic entropy change $-\Delta S_{M}$ of the particles can be tuned in size,
shape, and peak temperature depending on the annealing conditions. The peak
value of $-\Delta S_{M}$ varies in the range of 9--33 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for
a magnetic field change of 0--5 T. All the ErCo$_{2}$ atomized particles have
magnetocaloric properties comparable or superior to other promising candidates
for low-temperature magnetic refrigerants.

The angulon, a quasiparticle formed by a quantum rotor dressed by the
excitations of a many-body bath, can be used to describe an impurity rotating
in a fluid or solid environment. Here we propose a coherent state ansatz in the
co-rotating frame which provides a comprehensive theoretical description of
angulons. We reveal the quasiparticle properties, such as energies,
quasiparticle weights and spectral functions, and show that our ansatz yields a
persistent decrease in the impurity's rotational constant due to many-body
dressing, consistent with experimental observations. From our study, a picture
of the angulon emerges as an effective spin interacting with a magnetic field
that is self-consistently generated by the molecule's rotation. Moreover, we
discuss rotational spectroscopy, which focuses on the response of rotating
molecules to a laser perturbation in the linear response regime. Importantly,
we take into account initial-state interactions that have been neglected in
prior studies and reveal their impact on the excitation spectrum. To examine
the angulon instability regime, we use a single-excitation ansatz and obtain
results consistent with experiments, in which a broadening of spectral lines is
observed while phonon wings remain highly suppressed due to initial-state
interactions.

Neutron scattering measurements have been performed on deuterated powder
samples of claringbullite and Zn-doped claringbullite
(Zn$_x$Cu$_{4-x}$(OD)$_{6}$FCl). At low temperatures, claringbullite
Cu$_4$(OD)$_{6}$FCl forms a distorted pyrochlore lattice with long-range
magnetic order and spin-wave-like magnetic excitations. Partial Zn doping leads
to the nominal ZnCu$_3$(OD)$_{6}$FCl compound, a geometrically frustrated
spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet that shows no transition to magnetic order down
to 1.5 K. The magnetic excitations form a gapless continuum, a signature of
fractional excitations in a quantum spin liquid.

We study the self-organization of flexible planar trimer particles on a
structureless surface. The molecules are made up of two mesogenic units linked
by a spacer, all of which are modeled as hard needles of the same length. Each
molecule can dynamically adopt two conformational states: an achiral
bent-shaped (cis-) and a chiral zigzag (trans-) one.
Using constant pressure Monte Carlo simulations and Onsager-type density
functional theory (DFT), we show that the system consisting of these molecules
exhibits a rich spectrum of (quasi-)liquid crystalline phases. The most
interesting observation is the identification of stable smectic splay-bend
($S_{SB}$) and chiral smectic A ($S_A^*$) phases. The $S_{SB}$ phase is also
stable in the limit, where only cis-conformers are allowed. The second phase
occupying a considerable portion of the phase diagram is $S_A^*$ with chiral
layers, where the chirality of the neighboring layers is of opposite sign. The
study of the average fractions of the trans- and cis-conformers in various
phases shows that while in the isotropic phase all fractions are equally
populated, the $S_A^*$ phase is dominated by chiral conformers (zigzag), but
the achiral conformers win in the smectic splay-bend phase. To clarify the
possibility of stabilization of the nematic splay bend ($N_{SB}$) phase for
trimers, the free energy of the $N_{SB}$ and $S_{SB}$ phases is calculated
within DFT for the cis-conformers, for densities where simulations show stable
$S_{SB}$. It turns out that the $N_{SB}$ phase is unstable away from the phase
transition to the nematic phase, and its free energy is always higher than that
of $S_{SB}$, down to the transition to the nematic phase, although the
difference in free energies becomes extremely small when approaching the
transition.

When electron-electron interaction dominates over other electronic energy
scales, exotic, collective phenomena often emerge out of seemingly ordinary
matter. The strongly correlated phenomena, such as quantum spin liquid and
unconventional superconductivity, represent a major research frontier and a
constant source of inspiration. Central to strongly correlated physics is the
concept of Mott insulator, from which various other correlated phases derive.
The advent of two-dimensional (2D) materials brings unprecedented opportunities
to the study of strongly correlated physics in the 2D limit. In particular, the
enhanced correlation and extreme tunability of 2D materials enables exploring
strongly correlated systems across uncharted parameter space. Here, we discover
an intriguing metal to Mott insulator transition in 1T-TaSe$_2$ as the material
is thinned down to atomic thicknesses. Specifically, we discover, for the first
time, that the bulk metallicity of 1T-TaSe$_2$ arises from a band crossing
Fermi level. Reducing the dimensionality effectively quenches the kinetic
energy of the initially itinerant electrons and drives the material into a Mott
insulating state. The dimensionality-driven Metal to Mott insulator transition
resolves the long-standing dichotomy between metallic bulk and insulating
surface of 1T-TaSe$_2$. Our results additionally establish 1T-TaSe$_2$ as an
ideal variable system for exploring various strongly correlated phenomena.

In this paper, starting from the Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) equation, we derive a
general expression for the contact value of the singlet distribution function
near a hard wall for anisotropic fluids. This relation includes two separate
contributions. One is connected to the partial bulk pressure relative to a
given orientation of the molecules. The second one is connected to the
anchoring phenomena and is characterized by the direct interaction between the
molecules and the wall. From this relation, we then formulate the contact
theorem for the density and the order parameter profiles. The results are
illustrated on the case of a nematic fluid near a hard wall.

We investigate the full and half-shells of Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te topological
crystalline insulator deposited by molecular beam epitaxy on the sidewalls of
wurtzite GaAs nanowires (NWs). Due to the distinct orientation of the IV-VI
shell with respect to the III-V core the lattice mismatch along the nanowire
axis is less than 4%. The Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te solid solution is chosen due to the
topological crystalline insulator properties for some critical concentrations
of Sn (x >= 0.4). The IV-VI shells are grown with different compositions
spanning from binary SnTe, through Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te with decreasing x value down
to binary PbTe (x = 0). The samples are analyzed by scanning transmission
electron microscopy, which reveals the presence of (110) or (100) oriented
binary PbTe and (100)Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te on the sidewalls of wurtzite GaAs NWs.

By first-principles calculations, we study the magnetic and topological
properties of XYBi2Te5-family (X, Y =Mn, Ni, V, Eu) compounds. The strongly
coupled double magnetic atom-layers can significantly enhance the magnetic
ordering temperature while keeping the topologically nontrivial properties.
Particularly, NiVBi2Te5 is found to be a magnetic Weyl semimetal in bulk and a
Chern insulator in thin film with both the Curie temperature and magnetic gap
well above 77K. Ni2Bi2Te5 exhibits a dynamic axion state above 77K with a
magnetic ordering temperature up to room temperature. These results indicate an
approach to realize high temperature QAHE and other topological quantum effects

We realized a time-domain simulator based on the electrodynamics of Cooper
pairs and quasiparticles in Josephson junctions. The tool, based on the charge
carriers' densities of states described by the Werthamer and Harris formalisms
of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, allows to analyze the behavior of
current- or voltage-controlled Josephson junction-based circuits for any signal
waveform, at a physical temperature comprised between the absolute temperature
and the critical temperature. The simulator can account for I-V curve
hysteresis depending on the McCumber parameter, or Shapiro and photo-assisted
steps in the presence of a monochromatic microwave signal. We used the
simulator to assess the behavior of MgB2-based Josephson junctions at THz
frequencies by taking into account the presence of the two anisotropic gaps of
MgB2.

Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are extensively
investigated for opto-electronic applications that require strong light-matter
interactions. In view of such applications, it is essential to understand how
(photo)excitation alters the non-linear optical response of these materials
under high carrier density conditions. Broadband transient absorption (TA)
spectroscopy is by now a widely used tool to study semiconductor physics in
such highly excited systems. However, the complex interplay between different
many-body interactions in 2D materials produces highly congested spectral
information and an ensuing non-trivial nonlinear photo-response, thereby
masking the desired intrinsic photophysics. Herein, we outline a concise
roadmap for analyzing such congested datasets based on examples of TA analysis
of various 2D materials. In particular, we emphasize the synergy between an
initial qualitative understanding of the transient photo-response based on line
shapes and their derivatives, and a consequent quantitative spectral
deconvolution backed by such insights.

<br>
<br>
The interplay between a multitude of electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of
freedom underlies the complex phase diagrams of quantum materials. Layer
stacking in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is responsible for exotic
electronic and magnetic properties, which inspires stacking control of
two-dimensional magnetism. Beyond the interplay between stacking order and
interlayer magnetism, we discover a spin-shear coupling mechanism in which a
subtle shear of the atomic layers can have a profound effect on the intralayer
magnetic order in a family of vdW antiferromagnets. Using time-resolved x-ray
diffraction and optical linear dichroism measurements, interlayer shear is
identified as the primary structural degree of freedom that couples with
magnetic order. The recovery times of both shear and magnetic order upon
optical excitation diverge at the magnetic ordering temperature with the same
critical exponent. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory shows that this
concurrent critical slowing down arises from a linear coupling of the
interlayer shear to the magnetic order, which is dictated by the broken mirror
symmetry intrinsic to the monoclinic stacking. Our results highlight the
importance of interlayer shear in ultrafast control of magnetic order via
spin-mechanical coupling.

Speckle patterns produced by coherent X-ray have a close relationship with
the internal structure of materials but quantitative inversion of the
relationship to determine structure from images is challenging. Here, we
investigate the link between coherent X-ray speckle patterns and sample
structures using a model 2D disk system and explore the ability of machine
learning to learn aspects of the relationship. Specifically, we train a deep
neural network to classify the coherent X-ray speckle pattern images according
to the disk number density in the corresponding structure. It is demonstrated
that the classification system is accurate for both non-disperse and disperse
size distributions.

<br>
<br>
The soft modes associated with continuous-order phase transitions are
commonly associated with particularly strong anharmonicity. Here, we show that
this can lead to overdamped behavior already far above the actual transition
temperature using molecular dynamics simulations and a machine-learned
potential. While in the overdamped limit the interpretation of lattice
vibrations as phonon quasi-particles with a specified frequency and relaxation
time becomes physically questionable the mathematical description in terms of
damped oscillators still holds. A physically more intuitive picture can be
obtained by considering the relaxation times of the mode coordinate and its
conjugate momentum, which at the instability approach infinity and the inverse
damping factor, respectively. We demonstrate this behavior quantitatively for
the prototypical case of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition of the
inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3, and show that the overdamped region
extends almost 200 K (or about 60%) above the transition temperature.

<br>
<br>
Establishing a comprehensive model of the rich spin dynamics in
BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ has been a challenge over the last decade. Inelastic neutron
scattering experiments revealed that its elementary triplons are non-degenerate
showing the existence of significant anisotropic spin couplings. Evidence for
triplon decay into two triplons has been found, but two prominent downturns in
the dispersions eluded an explanation. Level repulsion due to hybridization of
single triplons with the continuum of two-triplon scattering states has been
proposed as explanation. We show that this concept may explain the weak
downturn at higher energies, but fails for the most pronounced downturn at
lower energy. In turn, we provide evidence that this downturn is the signature
of a two-triplon bound state of essentially singlet character pointing to
triplon-triplon interaction as the second crucial ingredient of the spin
dynamics in this exemplary system.

<br>
<br>
We present an experimental and numerical study of three-magnon splitting in a
micrometer-sized magnetic disk with the vortex state strongly deformed by
static in-plane magnetic fields. Excited with a large enough power at frequency
$f_\mathrm{RF}$, the primary radial magnon modes of a cylindrical magnetic
vortex can decay into secondary azimuthal modes via spontaneous three-magnon
splitting. This nonlinear process exhibits selection rules leading to
well-defined and distinct frequencies $f_\mathrm{RF}/2\pm \Delta f$ of the
secondary modes. Here, we demonstrate that three-magnon splitting in vortices
can be significantly modified by deforming the magnetic vortex with in-plane
magnetic fields, leading to a much richer three-magnon response. We find that,
with increasing field, an additional class of secondary modes is excited which
are localized to the highly-flexed regions adjacent to the displaced vortex
core. While these modes satisfy the same selection rules of three-magnon
splitting, they exhibit a much lower three-magnon threshold power compared to
regular secondary modes of a centered vortex. The applied static magnetic
fields are small ($\simeq$ 10 mT), providing an effective parameter to control
the nonlinear spectral response of confined vortices. Our work expands the
understanding of nonlinear magnon dynamics in vortices and advertises these for
potential neuromorphic applications based on magnons.

Grain boundaries, the two-dimensional (2D) defects between differently
oriented crystals, control mechanical and transport properties of materials.
Our fundamental understanding of grain boundaries is still incomplete even
after nearly a century and a half of research since Sorby first imaged grains.
Here, we present a systematic study, over 9 orders of magnitude of size scales,
in which we analyze 2D defects between two neighboring crystals across five
hierarchy levels and investigate their crystallographic, compositional, and
electronic features. The levels are (a) the macroscale interface alignment and
grain misorientation (held constant here); (b) the systematic mesoscopic change
in the inclination of the grain boundary plane for the same orientation
difference; (c) the facets, atomic motifs (structural units), and internal
nanoscopic defects within the boundary plane; (d) the grain boundary chemistry;
and (e) the electronic structure of the atomic motifs. As a model material, we
use Fe alloyed with B and C, exploiting the strong interdependence of interface
structure and chemistry in this system. This model system is the basis of the
1.9 billion tons of steel produced annually and has an eminent role as a
catalyst. Surprisingly, we find that even a change in the inclination of the GB
plane with identical misorientation impacts GB composition and atomic
arrangement. Thus, it is the smallest structural hierarchical level, the atomic
motifs, which control the most important chemical properties of the grain
boundaries. This finding not only closes a missing link between the structure
and chemical composition of such defects but also enables the targeted design
and passivation of the chemical state of grain boundaries to free them from
their role as entry gates for corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, or mechanical
failure.

Electrically controllable non-volatile magnetic memories show great potential
for the replacement of semiconductor-based technologies. Recently there has
been strong interest in spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced magnetization reversal
due to the device's increased lifetime and speed of operation. However, recent
SOT switching studies reveal an incubation delay in the ~ns range due to
stochasticity in the nucleation of a magnetic domain during reversal. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate ultrafast SOT-induced magnetization switching
dynamics of a ferromagnet with no incubation delay by avoiding the nucleation
process and driving the magnetization coherently. We employ an ultrafast
photo-conducting switch and a co-planar strip line to generate and guide ~ps
current pulses into the heavy metal/ferromagnet layer stack and induce
ultrafast SOT. We use magneto-optical probing to investigate the magnetization
switching dynamics with sub-picosecond time resolution. Depending on the
relative current pulse and in-plane magnetic field polarities, we observe
either an ultrafast demagnetization and subsequent recovery along with a
SOT-induced precessional oscillation, or ultrafast SOT switching. The
magnetization zero-crossing occurs in ~70 ps, which is approximately an order
of magnitude faster than previous studies. Complete switching needs ~250 ps and
is limited by the heat diffusion to the substrate. We use a macro-magnetic
simulation coupled with an ultrafast heating model to analyze the effect of
ultrafast thermal anisotropy torque and current-induced torque in the observed
dynamics. Good agreement between our experimental results and the macro-spin
model shows that the switching dynamics are coherent and present no noticeable
incubation delay. Our work suggests a potential pathway toward dramatically
increasing the writing speed of SOT magnetic random-access memory devices.

Superconductors are classified by their behaviour in a magnetic field into
type-I, which transition from a superconducting Meissner to a normal metallic
state at the critical field and type-II, which have an additional Shubnikov
phase of an Abrikosov lattice consisting of vortices with one magnetic flux
quantum, each. For type-I superconductors of finite lateral dimensions, the
transition to the normal state is, however, known to occur locally in form of
domains in the so called intermediate Landau state. Although bulk lead (Pb) is
classified as a prototypical type-I superconductor, we surprisingly observe
single-flux-quantum and multiple-flux-quanta vortices in the intermediate state
using mK scanning tunneling microscopy. These vortices have a diameter of at
least $\approx 100\,\mathrm{nm}$ and grow in size with the number of confined
flux quanta $\Phi_{0} = h/2e$. By probing the quasiparticle local density of
states (LDOS) inside the vortices and comparison with simulations, we identify
the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon states of the two superconducting bands of Pb and
use them to determine the winding number of the vortices.

We investigate the impact of the oxidizing character of the nitric medium on
the evolution of the intergranular corrosion of a stainless steel. In two
different oxidizing conditions ("severe" and "soft"), the corroded surface of
the steel reaches a different steady state: the oxide is thicker, the
intergranular grooves are thinner and the surface area is larger in the
"severe" conditions than in the "soft" ones. Then we investigate the effect of
an alternative "severe then soft" corrosion sequence. We show that the system
re-adapts to the "soft" conditions without memory effect from the previous
"severe" ones. bstra

A microstructure-sensitive fatigue life prediction framework based on CP-FFT
is proposed to study SLM fabricated Hastelloy-X. The microstructure enters in
the model through the shape, size and orientation distributions of grains in
the RVEs, which are generated from experimental EBSD data. The framework has
been applied to specimens built in two different directions with different
polycrystalline microstructures and is able to accurately predict their fatigue
life, using just two experiments for calibration. The model reproduces the
better fatigue performance found experimentally at high stresses for samples
built in transverse direction, identifying the origin of this anisotropy in
grain aspect ratios.

We investigate analytically and computationally the dynamics of 2D needle
crystal growth from the melt in a narrow channel. Our analytical theory
predicts that, in the low supersaturation limit, the growth velocity $V$
decreases in time $t$ as a power law $V \sim t^{-2/3}$, which we validate by
phase-field and dendritic-needle-network simulations. Simulations further
reveal that, above a critical channel width $\Lambda \approx 5l_D$, where $l_D$
the diffusion length, needle crystals grow with a constant $V<V_s$, where $V_s$
is the free-growth needle crystal velocity, and approaches $V_s$ in the limit
$\Lambda\gg l_D$.

We study transport in the free fermionic one-dimensional systems subjected to
arbitrary local potentials. The bias needed for the transport is modeled by the
initial highly non-equilibrium distribution where only half of the system is
populated. Additionally to that, the local potential is also suddenly changed
when the transport starts. For such a quench protocol we compute the Full
Counting Statistics (FCS) of the number of particles in the initially empty
part. In the thermo\-dynamic limit, the FCS can be expressed via the Fredholm
determinant with the kernel depending on the scattering data and Jost solutions
of the pre-quench and the post-quench potentials. We discuss the large-time
asymptotic behavior of the obtained determinant and observe that if two or more
bound states are present in the spectrum of the post-quench potential the
information about the initial state manifests itself in the persistent
oscillations of the FCS. On the contrary, when there are no bound states the
asymptotic behavior of the FCS is determined solely by the scattering data of
the post-quench potential, which for the current (the first moment) is given by
the Landauer--B\"uttiker formalism. The information about the initial state can
be observed only in the transient dynamics.

This work presents a detailed experimental-numerical analysis of a low-carbon
dual-phase steel microstructure, revealing evidence of significant anisotropic
plastic deformation in lath martensite. A careful determination of the habit
plane orientations in the present martensitic variants demonstrates that the
observed traces of plastic slip coincide with the directions of the
corresponding habit planes. To study the local lath martensite plastic
activity, a dedicated substructure-enriched crystal plasticity based model is
exploited. Compared with conventional bcc crystal plasticity, the model
incorporates an extra crystallographic slip plane containing 3 softer slip
systems parallel to the habit planes to capture the role of habit-plane
plasticity. Simulations reveal consistent strain localization patterns as those
observed in the experiments, with most plasticity localized in the martensite
packets with their habit plane oriented favorably with respect to the applied
load. Based on these insights, recommendations for future martensite modelling
strategies and potential improvements of steels are discussed.

The elastic constants of an unconventional superconductor, UTe$_2$, were
investigated using ultrasound. In this paper, we report the elastic response of
the normal state at temperatures down to 2 K and up to 14 T for $H \parallel b$
at ambient pressure. The transverse ultrasonic mode $C_{55}$, which corresponds
to the strain susceptibility of $\varepsilon_{zx}$, shows softening with
decreasing temperature, whereas the $C_{44}$ and $C_{33}$ modes do not show
such softening. This clear mode dependence strongly suggests that UTe$_2$ has a
lattice instability for this specific symmetry.

Recent advances in material synthesis made it possible to realize
two-dimensional monolayers of candidate materials for a quantum spin liquid
(QSL) such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$,1T-TaSe$_2$ and 1T-TaS$_2$. In this work, we
propose an experimental setup that exploits nonlocal electrical probes to gain
information on the transport properties of a gapless QSL. The proposed setup is
a spinon-mediated drag experiment: a current is injected in one of the two
layers and a voltage is measured on the second metallic film. The overall
momentum transfer mechanism is a two-step process mediated by Kondo interaction
between the local moments in the quantum spin liquid and the spins of the
electrons. In the limit of negligible momentum relaxed within the QSL layer, we
calculate the drag relaxation rate for Kitaev, $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and U(1) QSLs
using Aslamazov-Larkin diagrams. We find, however, that the case of dominant
momentum relaxation within the QSL layer is far more relevant and thus develop
a model based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation to describe the proposed setup.
Within this framework we calculate the low temperature scaling behavior of the
drag resistivity, both for U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs with Fermi surfaces. In
some regimes we find a crossover in the temperature scaling that is different
between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and U(1) QSL both because of the non-Fermi liquid
nature of the U(1) QSL, and because of the qualitatively different momentum
relaxation mechanism within the QSL layer. Our findings suggest that parameters
of the system can be tuned to make the spinon-mediated drag a significant
fraction of the total transresistance.
