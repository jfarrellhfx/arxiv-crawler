<h3>Nonequilibrium hyperuniform states in active turbulence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14959</a>
<br>
<i>Rainer Backofen, Abdelrahman Y. A. Altawil, Marco Salvalaglio, Axel Voigt</i>
<p>We demonstrate that the complex spatiotemporal structure in active fluids can
feature characteristics of hyperuniformity. Using a hydrodynamic model, we show
that the transition from hyperuniformity to non-hyperuniformity and
anti-hyperuniformity depends on the strength of active forcing and can be
related to features of active turbulence without and with scaling
characteristics of inertial turbulence. Combined with identified signatures of
Levy walks and non-universal diffusion in these systems, this allows for a
biological interpretation and the speculation of non-equilibrium hyperuniform
states in active fluids as optimal states with respect to robustness and
strategies of evasion and foraging.

<h3>Ring Bose-Einstein condensate in a cavity: Chirality Detection and  Rotation Sensing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15226" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15226</a>
<br>
<i>Nalinikanta Pradhan, Pardeep Kumar, Rina Kanamoto, Tarak Nath Dey, M. Bhattacharya, Pankaj Kumar Mishra</i>
<p>Recently, a method has been proposed to detect the rotation of a ring
Bose-Einstein condensate, in situ, in real-time and with minimal destruction,
using a cavity driven with optical fields carrying orbital angular momentum.
This method is sensitive to the magnitude of the condensate winding number but
not its sign. In the present work, we consider simulations of the rotation of
the angular lattice formed by the optical fields and show that the resulting
cavity transmission spectra are sensitive to the sign of the condensate winding
number. We demonstrate the minimally destructive technique on persistent
current rotational eigenstates, counter-rotating superpositions, and a soliton
singly or in collision with a second soliton. Conversely, we also investigate
the sensitivity of the ring condensate, given knowledge of its winding number,
to the rotation of the optical lattice. This characterizes the effectiveness of
the optomechanical configuration as a laboratory rotation sensor. Our results
are important to studies of rotating ring condensates used in atomtronics,
superfluid hydrodynamics, simulation of topological defects and cosmological
theories, interferometry using matter-wave solitons, and optomechanical
sensing.

<h3>Buckling instability in a chain of sticky bubbles</h3>

<br>
<i>Carmen L. Lee, Kari Dalnoki-Veress</i>
<p>A slender object undergoing an axial compression will buckle to alleviate the
stress. Typically the morphology of the deformed object depends on the bending
stiffness for solids, or the viscoelastic properties for liquid threads. We
study a chain of uniform sticky air bubbles in an aqueous bath that rise due to
buoyancy. A buckling instability of the bubble chain, with a characteristic
wavelength, is observed in the absence of a bending stiffness. If a chain of
bubbles is produced faster than it is able to rise, the dominance of viscous
drag over buoyancy results in a compressive stress that is alleviated by
buckling the bubble chain. Using low Reynolds number hydrodynamics and
geometric arguments, we predict the critical buckling speed, the terminal speed
of a buckled chain and the amplitude of the buckles.

<h3>Quartz Crystal Microbalance frequency response to finite-size adsorbents  in liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15880</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander M. Leshansky, Itzhak Fouxon, Boris Y. Rubinstein</i>
<p>Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) has become a
major tool in the analysis of adsorption of nanometric objects, such as
proteins, viruses, liposomes and inorganic particles from the solution. While
in vacuum extremely accurate mass measurements are possible, in a liquid phase
the quantitative analysis is intricate due to the complex interplay of
hydrodynamic and adhesion forces, varying with the physicochemical properties
of adsorbent and the quartz resonator surfaces. In the present paper we dissect
the role of hydrodynamics for the analytically tractable scenario of a stiff
contact, whereas the adsorbed particles oscillate with the resonator as a whole
without rotation. Under the assumption of the low surface coverage, we
theoretically study the excess shear force exerted on the resonator due to
presence of a single adsorbed particle. The excess shear force has two
contributions: (i) the fluid-mediated force due to flow disturbance created by
the particle and (ii) the viscous force exerted on the particle by the fluid
and transmitted to the resonator via contact. We found that for small enough
particles there is a mutual cancellation of the above dual components of the
net excess shear force, reducing the overall effect of the hydrodynamics to
that comparable in magnitude to the inertial force. These findings indicate
that the accurate account of hydrodynamics in the analysis of QCM-D response is
as important as the inertial mass of the adsorbents (determining the frequency
shift in the Sauerbrey equation). The resulting dimensionless frequency and
dissipation shifts and the corresponding acoustic ratio computed numerically,
showing a fair agreement with previously published experimental results at low
oscillation frequencies.

<h3>Quantum Channel AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN High Electron Mobility Transistor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14672" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14672</a>
<br>
<i>G. Simin, M. Shur</i>
<p>Scaling down the GaN channel in a double heterostructure AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN High
Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) to the thicknesses on the order of or even
smaller than the Bohr radius confines electrons in the quantum well even at low
sheet carrier densities. In contrast to the conventional designs, this Quantum
Channel (QC) confinement is controlled by epilayer design and the polarization
field and not by the electron sheet density. As a result, the breakdown field
at low sheet carrier densities increases by approximately 36% or even more
because the quantization leads to an effective increase in the energy gap. In
addition, better confinement increases the electron mobility at low sheet
carrier densities by approximately 50%. Another advantage is the possibility of
increasing the aluminum molar fraction in the barrier layer because a very thin
layer prevents material relaxation and the development of dislocation arrays.
This makes the QC especially suitable for high-voltage, high-frequency,
high-temperature, and radiation-hard applications.

<h3>Pump-induced terahertz conductivity response and peculiar bound state in  Mn3Si2Te6</h3>

<p>We report the significant enhancement on ultrafast terahertz optical
conductivity and the unexpected formation of a polaronic-like state in
semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6 at room temperature. With the absorption of pump
photons, the low-frequency terahertz photoconductivity spectrum exhibits a
significant rise, quickly forming a broad peak and subsequently shifting to
higher energy. The short-lived nature of the broad peak, as well as the
distribution of optical constants, strongly points towards a transient polaron
mechanism. Our study not only provides profound insights into the remarkable
photoelectric response of Mn3Si2Te6 but also highlights its significant
potential for future photoelectric applications.

<h3>Extremal statistics for first-passage trajectories of drifted Brownian  motion under stochastic resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14714</a>
<br>
<i>Wusong Guo, Hao Yan, Hanshuang Chen</i>
<p>We study the extreme value statistics of first-passage trajectories
generating from a one-dimensional drifted Brownian motion subject to stochastic
resetting to the starting point with a constant rate $r$. Each stochastic
trajectory starts from a positive position $x_0$ and terminates whenever the
particle hits the origin for the first time. By deriving the exit probability
of the particle confined in an interval $\left[0, M \right] $ through zero, we
obtain the exact expression for the marginal distribution $P_r(M|x_0)$ of the
maximum displacement $M$. Stochastic resetting has a profound impact on
$P_r(M|x_0)$ and the expected value $\langle M \rangle$ of $M$. Depending on
the drift velocity $v$, $\langle M \rangle$ shows three distinct trends of
change with $r$. For $v \geq 0$, $\langle M \rangle$ decreases monotonically
with $r$, and tends to $2x_0$ as $r \to \infty$. For $v_c<v<0$, $\langle M
\rangle$ shows a nonmonotonic dependence on $r$, in which a minimum $\langle M
\rangle$ exists for an intermediate level of $r$. For $v\leq v_c$, $\langle M
\rangle$ increases monotonically with $r$. Moreover, by deriving the propagator
and using path decomposition technique, we obtain in the Laplace domain the
joint distribution of $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which the maximum $M$ is
reached. Interestingly, the dependence of the expected value $\langle t_m
\rangle$ of $t_m$ on $r$ is either monotonic or nonmonotonic, depending on the
value of $v$. For $v>v_m$, there is a nonzero resetting rate at which $\langle
t_m \rangle$ attains its minimum. Otherwise, $\langle t_m \rangle$ increases
monotonically with $r$. We provide an analytical determination of two critical
values of $v$, $v_c\approx -1.69415 D/x_0$ and $v_m\approx -1.66102 D/x_0$,
where $D$ is the diffusion constant. Finally, numerical simulations are
performed to support our theoretical results.

<h3>Level spacing statistics of the Haldane chain and its Kennedy-Tasaki  dual</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14715</a>
<br>
<i>Biquan Yang, Zijian Xiong</i>
<p>We study the level spacing statistics of three spin-1 models in one
dimension, they are the Haldane chain, dual model which is obtained by Haldane
chain under the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and the combination of the first
two models which contains a solvable self-dual point. Although the first two
models are unitary equivalent, their symmetries are different and this leads to
different level spacing statistics in these two models. Concretely, the level
spacing in the Haldane chain obeys random matrix theory statistics, while the
dual model shows non-random matrix theory statistics. This example shows that
the level spacing statistics in two unitary equivalent systems can be
different. We find that the non-random matrix theory statistics in the dual
model can be ascribed to a non-local hidden symmetry. Under perturbations that
remove the hidden symmetry, the dual model shows random matrix theory
statistics. For the last model, we observe a crossover from chaotic to
integrable around the self-dual point.

<h3>Thermal Spin Orbit Torque with Dresselhaus Spin Orbit Coupling</h3>

<br>
<i>Chun Yi Xue, Ya Ru Wang, Zheng Chuan Wang</i>
<p>Based on the spinor Boltzmann equation, we obtain a temperature dependent
thermal spin-orbit torque in terms of the local equilibrium distribution
function in a two dimensional ferromagnet with Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.
We also derive the continuity equation of spin accumulation and spin current,
the spin diffusion equation in Dresselhaus ferromagnet, which contains the
thermal spin orbit torque under local equilibrium assumption. This temperature
dependent thermal spin-orbit torque originates from the temperature gradient
applied to the system. it is also sensitive to temperature due to the local
equilibrium distribution function therein. In the spin diffusion equation, we
can single out the usual spin-orbit torque as well as the spin transfer torque,
which is conceded to our previous results. Finally, we illustrate them by an
example of spin-polarized transport through a ferromagnet with Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling driven by temperature gradient, those torques including
thermal spin-orbit torque are demonstrated numerically.

<br>
<i>Dian Xu, Shanshan Wang, Feng Gao, Wei Li, Jianmin Shen</i>
<p>In the field of statistical physics, machine learning has gained significant
popularity and has achieved remarkable results in recent studies on phase
transitions.In this paper, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
Autoencoder(AE) based on Unsupervised learning to study the various
configurations of the percolation model in equilibrium phase transition. In
certain phase transition models, such as the DP model in non-equilibrium phase
transitions, the order parameter is particle density. However, in some other
phase transition models, such as the percolation model, it is not. This study
involved randomizing and selecting percolation graphs to be used as input for a
neural network, and analyzed the obtained results, indicating that the outputs
of the single latent variable of AE and the first principal component of PCA
are signals related to particle density.

<h3>Roadmap on machine learning glassy liquids</h3>

<i>Gerhard Jung, Rinske M. Alkemade, Victor Bapst, Daniele Coslovich, Laura Filion, François P. Landes, Andrea Liu, Francesco Saverio Pezzicoli, Hayato Shiba, Giovanni Volpe, Francesco Zamponi, Ludovic Berthier, Giulio Biroli</i>
<p>Unraveling the connections between microscopic structure, emergent physical
properties, and slow dynamics has long been a challenge in the field of the
glass transition. The absence of clear visible structural order in amorphous
configurations complicates the identification of the key features related to
structural relaxation and transport properties. The difficulty in sampling
equilibrated configurations at low temperatures hampers thorough numerical and
theoretical investigations. This roadmap article explores the potential of
machine learning (ML) techniques to face these challenges, building on the
algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision and image recognition. We
present successful ML applications, as well as many open problems for the
future, such as transferability and interpretability of ML approaches. We
highlight new ideas and directions in which ML could provide breakthroughs to
better understand glassy liquids. To foster a collaborative community effort,
the article introduces the "GlassBench" dataset, providing simulation data and
benchmarks for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional glass-formers.
Emphasizing the importance of benchmarks, we identify critical metrics for
comparing the performance of emerging ML methodologies, in line with
benchmarking practices in image and text recognition. The goal of this roadmap
is to provide guidelines for the development of ML techniques in systems
displaying slow dynamics, while inspiring new directions to improve our
understanding of glassy liquids.

<h3>Theory of classical electrodynamics with topologically quantized  singularities as electric charges</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14771" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14771</a>
<br>
<i>Bruno Golik, Dario Jukić, Hrvoje Buljan</i>
<p>We formulate a theory of classical electrodynamics where the only admissible
electric charges are topological singularities in the electromagnetic field,
and charge quantization is accounted by the Chern theorem, such that Dirac
magnetic monopoles are not needed. The theory allows positive and negative
charges of equal magnitude, where the sign of the charge corresponds to the
chirality of the topological singularity. Given the trajectory ${\bf w}(t)$ of
the singularity, one can calculate electric and magnetic fields identical to
those produced by Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge, apart from a
multiplicative constant factor related to electron charge and vacuum
permittivity. The theory is based on the relativistic Weyl equation in
frequency-wavevector space, with eigenstates comprising the position, velocity,
and acceleration of the singularity, and eigenvalues defining the retarded
position of the charge. From the eigenstates we calculate the Berry connection
and the Berry curvatures, and identify the curvatures as electric and magnetic
fields.

<h3>Light--absorbed orbital angular momentum in the linear response regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14774</a>
<br>
<i>Philippe Scheid, Stéphane Mangin, Sébastien Lebègue</i>
<p>In exploring the light-induced dynamics within the linear response regime,
this study investigates the induced orbital angular momentum on a wide variety
of electronic structures. We derive a general expression for the torque induced
by light on different electronic systems based on their characteristic
dielectric tensor. We demonstrate that this phenomenon diverges from the
inverse Faraday effect as it produces an orbital magnetization persistent
post-illumination. Indeed, our results reveal that, while isotropic
non-dissipative materials do not absorb orbital angular momentum from
circularly polarized light, any symmetry-breaking arrangement of matter, be it
spatial or temporal, introduces novel channels for the absorption of orbital
angular momentum, or magnetization. Most notably, in dissipative materials,
circularly polarized light imparts a torque corresponding to a change in
orbital angular momentum of $\hbar$ per absorbed photon. The potential of these
mechanisms to drive helicity-dependent magnetic phenomena paves the way for a
deeper understanding of light-matter interactions. Notably, the application of
pump-probe techniques in tandem with our findings allows experimentalists to
quantitatively assess the amount of orbital angular momentum transferred to
electrons in matter, thus hopefully enhancing our ability to steer ultrafast
light-induced magnetization dynamics.

<h3>Quantum transport in an environment parametrized by dispersive bosons</h3>

<br>
<i>Monodeep Chakraborty, Holger Fehske</i>
<p>We generalize the two-channel (Edwards) fermion-boson model describing
quantum transport in a background medium to the more realistic case of
dispersive bosons. Using the variational exact diagonalization technique, we
numerically solve the extended model in a one-dimensional setting, for both
downward and upward curved boson dispersion, and show that going away from the
previous Einstein-boson assumption has profound consequences for the particle
transport. Specifically, we analyze the ground-state and spectral properties
and demonstrate the renormalization of the particle's coherent band, effective
mass, photoemission spectra and fermion-boson correlation functions due to the
interplay of fluctuations and correlations in a dispersive environment.

<i>Francesca Ruggeri, Christian Schwemmer, Mirko Stauffer, Philippe M. Nicollier, Jacqueline Figueiredo da Silva, Patrick D. Bosshart, Kirstin Kochems, Dimitrios Fotiadis, Armin Knoll, Heiko Wolf</i>
<p>Purple membranes from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum consist of
two-dimensional crystals of the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin,
which convert photons into a proton gradient across the cell membrane. This
functional feature and the structural rigidity make them appealing candidates
for integration into biomimetic devices. To this end, and in order to carry out
their function, purple membranes must be positioned in the correct orientation
at the position of interest. Precise placement and control over the orientation
of nanoscale objects still constitutes a formidable challenge. Here we show
that isolated purple membrane patches can be transported and positioned at
predefined locations in nanofluidic confinement, with control over their
orientation at the target sites. The transport is achieved through a rocking
Brownian motor scheme, while the controlled deposition of the membranes is
realized by engineering the surface potential of a fluid-filled nanofluidic
slit. This controlled manipulation of purple membrane patches outlines a new
pathway towards the integration of biological or other delicate supramolecular
structures into top-down-fabricated patterns, for the assembly of nanoscale
hybrid devices that serve as a light-driven source of (chemical) energy.

<h3>Fluctuation corrections to Lifshitz tails in disordered systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14785</a>
<br>
<i>Enrique Rozas Garcia, Johannes Hofmann</i>
<p>Quenched disorder in semiconductors induces localized electronic states at
the band edge, which manifest as an exponential tail in the density of states.
For large impurity densities, this tail takes a universal Lifshitz form that is
characterized by short-ranged potential fluctuations. We provide both
analytical expressions and numerical values for the Lifshitz tail of a
parabolic conduction band, including its exact fluctuation prefactor. Our
analysis is based on a replica field integral approach, where the leading
exponential scaling of the tail is determined by an instanton profile, and
fluctuations around the instanton determine the subleading pre-exponential
factor. This factor contains the determinant of a fluctuation operator, and we
avoid a full computation of its spectrum by using a Gel'fand-Yaglom formalism,
which provides a concise general derivation of fluctuation corrections in
disorder problems. We provide a revised result for the disorder band tail in
two dimensions.

<h3>Rashba splitting in polar-nonpolar sandwich heterostructure : A DFT  Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14787</a>
<br>
<i>Sanchari Bhattacharya, Sanjoy Datta</i>
<p>In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) based
first-principles calculations to investigate the spin-orbit effects in the
electronic structure of a polar-nonpolar sandwich heterostructure namely
LAO$_{2.5}$/STO$_{5.5}$/LAO$_{2.5}$. Our focus on the Ti-3d bands reveals an
inverted ordering of the STO-$\rm t_{2g}$ orbital near the n-type interface,
consistent with earlier experimental work. In contrast, toward the p-type
interface, the orbital ordering aligns with the natural ordering of STO
orbitals, influenced by crystal field splitting. Interestingly, we have found a
strong inter-orbital coupling between $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbital, which has not
been reported earlier in $\rm SrTiO_3$ based 2D system. Additionally, our
observations highlight that the cubic Rashba splitting in this system surpasses
the linear Rashba splitting, contrary to experimental findings. This
comprehensive analysis contributes to a refined understanding of the role of
orbital mixing in Rashba splitting in the sandwich oxide heterostructures.

<h3>Ultrafast Green Single Photon Emission from an InGaN Quantum  Dot-in-a-GaN Nanowire at Room Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14821" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14821</a>
<br>
<i>Swagata Bhunia, Ayan Majumder, Soumyadip Chatterjee, Ritam Sarkar, Dhiman Nag, Kasturi Saha, Suddhasatta Mahapatra, Apurba Laha</i>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing demand for room-temperature visible
single-photon emission from InGaN nanowire-quantum-dots (NWQDs) due to its
potential in developing quantum computing, sensing, and communication
technologies. Despite various approaches explored for growing InGaN quantum
dots on top of nanowires (NWs), achieving the emission of a single photon at
room temperature with sensible efficiency remains a challenge. This challenge
is primarily attributed to difficulties in accomplishing the radial confinement
limit and the inherent giant built-in potential of the NWQD. In this report, we
have employed a novel Plasma Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE) growth
approach to reduce the diameter of the QD to the excitonic Bohr radius of
InGaN, thereby achieving strong lateral confinement. Additionally, we have
successfully suppressed the strong built-in potential by reducing the QD

emission (${\lambda}$ = 561 nm) at room-temperature from the NWQD and measured
the second-order correlation function $g^{2}(0)$ as 0.11, which is notably low
compared to other reported findings. Furthermore, the lifetime of carriers in
the QD is determined to be 775 ps, inferring a high operational speed of the
devices.

<h3>Magnetochiral anisotropy-induced nonlinear planar Hall effect in  Topological Insulator surface states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14841</a>
<br>
<i>D. C. Marinescu, Sumanta Tewari</i>
<p>In an intriguing recent experiment, it has been found that the
two-dimensional (2D) surface states of a three-dimensional (3D) strong
topological insulator (TI) support a non-zero Hall voltage transverse to an
applied electric field even when the external magnetic field is in the plane
(i.e., the in-plane Lorentz force vanishes). This so-called planar Hall effect
(PHE) of TI surface states is found to be non-linear, i.e., the Hall voltage
scales quadratically with the applied electric field and linearly with the
in-plane magnetic field. In this paper, we derive the non-linear PHE for strong
topological insulator surface states and show that the derivations contained in
the previous literature are incomplete, which can lead to quantitative or even
in some cases qualitative errors in the estimates for the nonlinear planar Hall
resistance. We derive the complete expressions for the non-linear planar Hall
currents for TI surface states with broken particle-hole symmetry and provide
results for different regimes of the surface state Hamiltonian which can be
compared with future experiments.

<h3>Experimental and numerical study of a second-order transition in the  behavior of confined self-propelled particles</h3>

<br>
<i>E. Barone, G. A. Patterson</i>
<p>In this study, we conduct experimental investigations on the behavior of
confined self-propelled particles within a circular arena, employing small
commercial robots capable of locomotion, communication, and information
processing. These robots execute circular trajectories, which can be clockwise
or counterclockwise, based on two internal states. Using a majority-based
stochastic decision algorithm, each robot can reverse its direction based on
the states of two neighboring robots. By manipulating a control parameter
governing the interaction, the system exhibits a transition-from a state where
all robots rotate randomly to one where they rotate uniformly in the same
direction. Moreover, this transition significantly impacts the trajectories of
the robots. To extend our findings to larger systems, we introduce a
mathematical model enabling characterization of the order transition type and
the resulting trajectories. Our results reveal a second-order transition from
active Brownian to chiral motion. Lastly, we analyze the particle density
within the arena, examining how it varies concerning system size and the
control parameter.

<i>Imad Limame, Peter Ludewig, Ching-Wen Shih, Marcel Hohn, Chirag C. Palekar, Wolfgang Stolz, Stephan Reitzenstein</i>
<p>We present the direct heteroepitaxial growth of high-quality InGaAs quantum
dots on silicon, enabling scalable, cost-effective quantum photonics devices
compatible with CMOS technology. GaAs heterostructures are grown on silicon via
a GaP buffer and defect-reducing layers. These epitaxial quantum dots exhibit
optical properties akin to those on traditional GaAs substrates, promising vast
potential for the heteroepitaxy approach. They demonstrate strong multi-photon
suppression with $g^{(2)}(\tau)=(3.7\pm 0.2) \times 10^{-2}$ and high photon
indistinguishability $V=(66\pm 19)$% under non-resonance excitation. We achieve
up to ($18\pm 1$)% photon extraction efficiency with a backside distributed
Bragg mirror, marking a crucial step toward silicon-based quantum
nanophotonics.

<h3>Self-aligned photonic defect microcavities with site-controlled quantum  dots</h3>

<br>
<i>C.-W. Shih, I. Limame, C. C. Palekar, A. Koulas-Simos, A. Kaganskiy, P. Klenovský, S. Reitzenstein</i>
<p>Despite the superiority in quantum properties, self-assembled semiconductor
quantum dots face challenges in terms of scalable device integration because of
their random growth positions, originating from the Stranski-Krastanov growth
mode. Even with existing site-controlled growth techniques, for example,
nanohole or buried stressor concepts, a further lithography and etching step
with high spatial alignment requirements isnecessary to accurately integrate
QDs into the nanophotonic devices. Here, we report on the fabrication and
characterization of strain-induced site-controlled microcavities where
site-controlled quantum dots are positioned at the antinode of the optical mode
field in a self-aligned manner without the need of any further nano-processing.
We show that the Q-factor, mode volume, height, and the ellipticity of
site-controlled microcavities can be tailored by the size of an integrated
AlAs/Al2O3 buried stressor, with an opening ranging from 1 to 4 $\mu$m. Lasing
signatures, including super-linear input-output response, linewidth narrowing
near threshold, and gain competition above threshold, are observed for a
3.6-$\mu$m self-aligned cavity with a Q-factor of 18000. Furthermore, by
waiving the rather complex lateral nano-structuring usually performed during
the fabrication process of micropillar lasers and vertical-cavity surface
emitting lasers, quasi-planar site-controlled cavities exhibit no detrimental
effects of excitation power induced heating and thermal rollover. Our
straightforward deterministic nanofabrication concept of high-quality quantum
dot microcavities integrates seamlessly with the industrial-matured
manufacturing process and the buried-stressor techniques, paving the way for
exceptional scalability and straightforward manufacturing of high-\b{eta}
microlasers and bright quantum light sources.

<h3>Anomalous Josephson effect in superconducting multilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14860</a>
<br>
<i>A. S. Osin, Alex Levchenko, Maxim Khodas</i>
<p>In this study, we explore the Josephson current-phase relation within a
planar diffuse tunnelling superconducting multilayer junction subjected to a
parallel magnetic field. Our investigation involves computing the supercurrent
associated with a fixed jump in the phase of the order parameter at each of the
two insulating interfaces, allowing us to derive the current-phase relation for
the junction. Employing perturbation theory in junction conductance, we
determine both the first and second harmonics of the current-phase relation
under specific magnetic field conditions. Notably, the presence of a strong
spin-orbit interaction in the middle region of the junction introduces an
anomalous Josephson effect. The interplay between spin-orbit and Zeeman
interactions results in the emergence of an effective vector potential. This
specific characteristic induces a phase shift in each harmonic of the
current-phase relation without altering the overall shape of the relation.

<br>
<i>Yurij V. Kalyuzhnyi, Taras Patsahan, Myroslav Holovko, Peter T. Cummings</i>
<p>A simple model for functionalized disordered porous media is proposed and the
effects of confinement on self-association, percolation and phase behavior of a
fluid of patchy particles are studied. The media is formed by a randomly
distributed hard-sphere obstacles fixed in space and decorated by a certain
number of off-center square-well sites. The properties of the fluid of patchy
particles, represented by the fluid of hard spheres each bearing a set of the
off-center square-well sites, are studied using an appropriate combination of
the scaled particle theory for the porous media, Wertheim's thermodynamic
perturbation theory, and the Flory-Stockmayer theory. To assess the accuracy of
the theory a set of computer simulations have been performed. In general,
predictions of the theory appear to be in a good agreement with computer
simulation results. Confinement and competition between the formation of bonds
connecting the fluid particles, and connecting fluid particles and obstacles of
the matrix, give rise to a re-entrant phase behavior with three critical points
and two separate regions of the liquid-gas phase coexistence.

subdivided the bulk material into subregions where the mechanical properties
are homogenized energetically. We demonstrate that the calculation can be

<i>Tianbi Zhang, T. Ben Britton</i>
<p>To engineer the next generation of advanced materials we must understand
their microstructure, and this requires microstructural characterization. This
can be achieved through the collection of high contrast, data rich, and
insightful microstructural maps. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) has
emerged as a popular tool available within the scanning electron microscope
(SEM), where maps are realized through the repeat capture and analysis of
Kikuchi diffraction patterns. Typical commercial EBSD systems require large and
sophisticated detectors that are mounted on the side of the SEM vacuum chamber
which can be limiting in terms of widespread access to the technique. In this
work, we present an alternative open-hardware solution based upon a compact
EBSD system with a simple, static geometry that uses an off-the-shelf direct
electron detector co-mounted with a sample. This simple stage is easy to
manufacture and improves our knowledge of the diffraction geometry
significantly. Microscope and detector control is achieved through software
application programming interface (API) integration. After pattern capture,
analysis of the diffraction patterns is performed using open-source analysis
within AstroEBSD. To demonstrate the potential of this set up, we present two
simple EBSD experiments using line scan and mapping. We hope that the present
system can inspire simpler EBSD system design for widespread access to the EBSD
technique and promote the use of open-source software and hardware in the
workflow of EBSD experiments.

<h3>A Replica-BCS theory for dirty superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Yat Fan Lau, Tai Kai Ng</i>
<p>Motivated by the discovery of the anomalous metal state in superconductor
thin films, we revisit in this paper the problem of dirty superconductors using
a replica-symmetric BCS (RS-BCS) theory for dirty metals with net attractive
interactions. Within the RS-BCS mean field theory, we show that the (dirty)
superconductor transits to a Cooper-pair-glass state beyond a critical strength
of disorder. The single particle tunneling density of states and the superfluid
density are computed within the RS-BCS theory for different strengths of
disorder. We find that the single-particle spectral gap is strongly enhanced by
disorder and the superfluid density reduces rapidly from the corresponding
clean superconducting limit with increasing strength of disorder but remains
finite in the Cooper-pair-glass state. The nature of the Cooper-pair-glass
state and relevance of our result to the anomalous metal state are briefly
discussed.

<h3>Graph Morphology of Non-Hermitian Bands</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuncheng Xiong, Haiping Hu</i>
<p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit diverse graph patterns of energy spectra under
open boundary conditions. Here we present an algebraic framework to
comprehensively characterize the spectral geometry and graph topology of
non-Bloch bands. Using a locally defined potential function, we unravel the
spectral-collapse mechanism from Bloch to non-Bloch bands, delicately placing
the spectral graph at the troughs of the potential landscape. The potential
formalism deduces non-Bloch band theory and generates the density of states via
Poisson equation. We further investigate the Euler-graph topology by
classifying spectral vertices based on their multiplicities and projections
onto the generalized Brillouin zone. Through concrete models, we identify three
elementary graph-topology transitions (UVY, PT-like, and self-crossing),
accompanied by the emergence of singularities in the generalized Brillouin
zone. Lastly, we unveil how to generally account for isolated edge states
outside the spectral graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for exploring the
versatile spectral geometry and graph topology of non-Hermitian non-Bloch
bands.

<p>This study presents theoretical results for physico-chemical properties of
system of molecules modeling bi-specific antibodies, such as,
dual-variable-domain monoclonal antibodies (DVD-Ig) and Fabs-In-Tandem
Immunoglobulin (FIT-Ig). These molecules are representatives of the engineered
proteins that combine the function and specificity of two monoclonal
antibodies. Individual molecules are here depicted as an assembly of nine (or
in case of the Fit-Ig eleven) hard spheres, organized to resemble the Y-shaped
object. The effects of the increased size, asymmetry, and flexibility of
individual molecules on measurable properties of such systems of molecules are
investigated. We examined the liquid-liquid phase separation, the second virial
coefficient $B_2$, and viscosity under various experimental conditions. The
calculations are compared with the data for regular monoclonal antibodies and
discussed in view of the experimental results for DVD-Ig solutions available in
literature.

<h3>Single-image based deep learning for precise atomic defects  identification</h3>

<p>Defect engineering has been profoundly employed to confer desirable
functionality to materials that pristine lattices inherently lack. Although
single atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
images are widely accessible for defect engineering, harnessing atomic-scale
images containing various defects through traditional image analysis methods is
hindered by random noise and human bias. Yet the rise of deep learning (DL)
offering an alternative approach, its widespread application is primarily
restricted by the need for large amounts of training data with labeled ground
truth. In this study, we propose a two-stage method to address the problems of
high annotation cost and image noise in the detection of atomic defects in
monolayer 2D materials. In the first stage, to tackle the issue of data
scarcity, we employ a two-state transformation network based on U-GAT-IT for
adding realistic noise to simulated images with pre-located ground truth
labels, thereby infinitely expanding the training dataset. In the second stage,
atomic defects in monolayer 2D materials are effectively detected with high
accuracy using U-Net models trained with the data generated in the first stage,
avoiding random noise and human bias issues. In both stages, we utilize
segmented unit-cell-level images to simplify the model's task and enhance its
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that not only sulfur vacancies, we are also
able to visualize oxygen dopants in monolayer MoS2, which are usually
overwhelmed by random background noise. As the training was based on a few
segmented unit-cell-level realistic images, this method can be readily extended
to other 2D materials. Therefore, our results outline novel ways to train the
model with minimized datasets, offering great opportunities to fully exploit
the power of machine learning (ML) applicable to a broad materials science
community.

<h3>Guiding principles for the design of a chemical vapor deposition process  for highly crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15007</a>
<br>
<i>Vladislav Voronenkov, Benjamin Groven, Henry Medina Silva, Pierre Morin, Stefan De Gendt</i>
<p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for advanced logic
transistor technologies are deposited by various modifications of the chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) method using a wide variety of precursors. Being a major
electrical performance limiter, the TMD crystal grain size strongly differs
between the various CVD precursor chemistries from nano- to millimeter-sized
crystals. However, it remains unclear how the CVD precursor chemistry affects
the nucleation density and resulting TMD crystal grain size. This work
postulates guiding principles to design a CVD process for highly crystalline
TMD deposition using a quantitative analytical model benchmarked against
literature. The TMD nucleation density reduces favorably under low
supersaturation conditions, where the metal precursor sorption on the starting
surface is reversible and the corresponding metal precursor desorption rate
exceeds the overall deposition rate. Such reversible precursor adsorption
guarantees efficient long-range gas-phase lateral diffusion of precursor
species in addition to short-range surface diffusion, which vitally increases
crystal grain size. As such, the proposed model explains the large spread in
experimentally observed TMD nucleation densities and crystal grain sizes for
state-of-the-art CVD chemistries. Ultimately, it empowers the reader to
interpret and modulate precursor adsorption and diffusion reactions through
designing CVD precursor chemistries compatible with temperature sensitive
application schemes.

<i>Yupei Zhang, Chongjie Mo, Ping Zhang, Wei Kang</i>
<p>We propose an ansatz without adjustable parameters for the calculation of
dynamical structure factor. The ansatz combines quasi-particle Green's
function, especially the contribution from the renormalization factor, and the
exchange-correlation kernel from time-dependent density functional theory
together, verified for typical metals and semiconductors from plasmon
excitation regime to Compton scattering regime. It has the capability to
reconcile both small-angle and large-angle x-ray scattering (IXS) signals with
much improved accuracy, which can be used, as the theoretical base model, in
inversely inferring electronic structures of condensed matter from IXS
experimental signals directly. It may also used to diagnose thermal parameters,
such as temperature and density, of dense plasmas in x-ray Thomson scattering
experiments.

<br>
<i>Dipendu Halder, Ronny Thomale, Saurabh Basu</i>
<p>We examine a non-Hermitian (NH) tight-binding system comprising of two
orbitals per unit cell and their electrical circuit analogues. We distinguish
the PT-symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases characterised by non-reciprocal
nearest neighbour couplings and onsite gain/loss terms, respectively. The
localisation of the edge modes or the emergence of the topological properties
are determined via the maximum inverse participation ratio, which has distinct
dependencies on the parameters that define the Hamiltonian. None of the above
scenarios exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect. We investigate the boundary
modes corresponding to the topological phases in a suitably designed electrical
circuit by analyzing the two-port impedance and retrieve the admittance band
structure of the circuit via imposing periodic boundary conditions. The
obtained results are benchmarked against the Hermitian version of the
two-orbital model to compare and discriminate against those obtained for the NH
variants.

<i>Adrián Ceferino, Francisco Guinea</i>
<p>We present simple models to describe the in-plane and the out-of-plane
lattice relaxation in twisted bilayer and symmetrically twisted trilayer
graphene. Analytical results and series expansions show that for twist angles
{\theta} > 1 $^{\circ}$, the in-plane atomic displacements lead to
pseudomagnetic fields weakly dependent on {\theta}. In symmetrically twisted
trilayer graphene, the central layer in-plane relaxation is greatly enhanced.
The joint effect of the relaxation-induced pseudoscalar potentials and the
associated energy difference between interlayer dimer and non-dimer pairs
resulted in a significant electron-hole asymmetry both in twisted bilayer and
trilayer graphene.

<br>
<i>Samya Sen, Anthony C. Yu, Changxin Dong, Andrea I. D'Aquino, Eric A. Appel</i>
<p>Hydrogels are soft materials engineered to suit a multitude of applications
that exploit their tunable mechanochemical properties. Dynamic hydrogels
employing noncovalent, physically crosslinked networks dominated by either
enthalpic or entropic interactions enable unique rheological and
stimuli-responsive characteristics. In contrast to enthalpy-driven interactions
that soften with increasing temperature, entropic interactions result in
largely temperature-independent mechanical properties. By engineering
interfacial polymer-particle interactions, we can induce a dynamic-to-covalent
transition in entropic hydrogels that leads to biomimetic non-ergodic aging in
the microstructure without altering the network mesh size. This transition is
tuned by varying temperature and formulation conditions such as $p$H, which
allows for multivalent tunability in properties. These hydrogels can thus be
designed to exhibit either temperature-independent metastable dynamic
crosslinking or time-dependent stiffening based on formulation and storage
conditions, all while maintaining strucutural features critical for controlling
mass transport, akin to many biological tissues. Such robust materials with
versatile and adaptable properties can be utilized in applications such as
wildfire suppression, surgical adhesives, and depot-forming injectable drug
delivery systems.

<h3>Unexpected results for the non-trivial fusion of Majorana zero modes in  interacting quantum-dot arrays</h3>

<br>
<i>Bradraj Pandey, Satoshi Okamoto, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experimental reports of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in
quantum-dot systems at the "sweet spot", where the electronic hopping $t_h$ is
equal to the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$, we study the
time-dependent spectroscopy corresponding to the non-trivial fusion of MZMs.
The expression non-trivial refers to the fusion of Majoranas from different
original pairs of MZMs with well-defined parities. For the first time, we
employ an experimentally accessible time-dependent real-space local
density-of-states (LDOS) method to investigate the non-trivial MZMs fusion
outcomes in canonical chains and in a Y-shape array of interacting electrons.
In the case of two pairs of MZMs initially disconnected, after fusion we find
equal-height peaks in the electron and hole components of the LDOS, signaling
non-trivial fusion into both the vacuum $I$ and fermion $\Psi$ channels with
equal weight. For $\pi$-junction quantum dots, where the superconducting phase
has opposite signs on the left and right portions of the chain, after the
non-trivial fusion surprisingly, we observed the formation of an exotic
two-site MZM near the center of the chain, coexisting with another single-site
MZM. Furthermore, we also studied the fusion of three MZMs in the Y-shape
geometry. In this case, after the fusion we observed the novel formation of
another exotic multi-site MZM, with properties depending on the connection and
geometry of the central region of the Y-shape quantum-dot array.

<i>H. Alaeian, V. Walther</i>
<p>Spatial structures commonly emerge in interacting nonlinear systems. In this
study, we focus on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the recently-established
platform of Rydberg exciton-polaritons, fueled by their characteristic
long-range non-local interactions, in the presence of an external drive and
dissipation. Our work elucidates how modulational instability sets off
spontaneous density pattern formations in a Rydberg polariton system with
characteristic scales in the micron range. Under conditions of an unstable
flattop state, we track the evolution of the polariton ensemble, showing the
emergence of meta-stable patterns and their collapse in the long-time limit. We
trace this phenomenon back to the destructive interference between the
polariton state and the pump in a driven ensemble. Finally, we map out
conditions that allow stable patterns to form under incoherent pumping. These
findings provide new opportunities for exploring the emerging field of
long-range interacting gases through Rydberg exciton-polaritons.

<p>The Hubbard and closely related t-J models are exciting platforms for
unconventional superconductivity. Through state-of-the-art density matrix
renormalization group calculations using the grand canonical ensembles, we
address open issues regarding the ground-state phase diagram of the extended
t-J model on a square lattice in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate
superconductors. On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure t-J
model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a
wide range of hole doping ($\delta = 0.1 - 0.2$), hosts an exotic SC state
where the d-wave and unidirectional pair density wave SC co-exist with spin and
charge bond orders. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$
suppresses the pair density wave and other co-coexisting orders, leading to a
d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. We
reveal a simple mechanism for SC in the t-J model, in which the nearest
neighbor hopping plays an essential role in driving the formation of Cooper
pairs with real-space sign oscillations balancing the competition between the
kinetic and exchange energies. Our work validates the t-J model as a proper
minimum model for describing fundamental physics of cuprate superconductors

<i>K. Iyer, F. Ronetti, B. Grémaud, T. Martin, J. Rech, T. Jonckheere</i>
<p>Anyons are particles intermediate between fermions and bosons, characterized
by a nontrivial exchange phase, yielding remarkable braiding statistics. Recent
experiments have shown that anyonic braiding has observable consequences on
edge transport in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Here, we study
transport signatures of anyonic braiding when the anyons have a finite temporal
width. We show that the width of the anyons, even extremely small, can have a
tremendous impact on transport properties and braiding signatures. In
particular, we find that taking the finite width into account allows us to
explain recent experimental results on FQHE at filling factor $2/5$ [Ruelle et
al., Phys. Rev. X $\mathbf{13}$, 011031 (2023)]. Our work shows that the finite
width of anyons crucially influences setups involving anyonic braiding,
especially for composite fractions where the exchange phase is larger than
$\pi/2$.

hard spheres can be generalized to a soft granular rheology by renormalizing
the critical volume fraction and friction coefficient to pressure-dependent
values and using the addition of stress scales. Using volume-imposed rheometry,
we find same critical rheological behavior around jamming across flow regimes
with same power laws of the distance to jamming as those found for soft
colloids when using again stress additivity. These results support the
conclusion that suspensions of soft particles across flow regimes can be
described by a common framework around the jamming transition.

<h3>A Universal Model of Floquet Operator Krylov Space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15116" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15116</a>
<br>
<i>Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Aditi Mitra</i>
<p>It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in
any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an
operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator
of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in
one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field
couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence
(topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes
at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share
certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in
the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings.
These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical
convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$
chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge
modes.

<h3>Near-power-law temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness in  strongly disordered superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15126</a>
<br>
<i>Anton V. Khvalyuk, Thibault Charpentier, Nicolas Roch, Benjamin Sacépé, Mikhail V. Feigel'man</i>
<p>In BCS superconductors, the superfluid stiffness is virtually constant at low
temperature and only slightly affected by the exponentially low density of
thermal quasiparticles. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study
on the temperature dependence of superfluid stiffness $\Theta\left(T\right)$ in
a strongly disordered pseudo-gaped superconductor, amorphous $\text{InO}_{x}$,
which exhibits non-BCS behavior. Experimentally, we report an unusual power-law
suppression of the superfluid stiffness $\delta\Theta\left(T\right)\propto
T^{b}$ at $T\ll T_{c}$, with $b\sim1.6$, which we measured via the frequency
shift of microwave resonators. Theoretically, by combining analytical and
numerical methods to a model of a disordered superconductor with pseudogap and
spatial inhomogeneities of the superconducting order parameter, we found a
qualitatively similar low-temperature power-law behavior with exponent
$b\sim1.6-3$ being disorder-dependent. This power-law suppression of the
superfluid density occurs mainly due to the broad distribution of the
superconducting order parameter that is known to exist in such superconductors
[arXiv:1012.3630], even moderately far from the superconductor-insulator
transition. The presence of the power-law dependence
$\delta\Theta\left(T\right)\propto T^{b}$ at low $T\ll T_{c}$ demonstrates the
existence of low-energy collective excitations; in turn, it implies the
presence of a new channel of dissipation in inhomogeneous superconductors
caused by sub-gap excitations that are not quasiparticles. Our findings have
implications for the use of strongly disordered superconductors as
superinductance in quantum circuits.

<p>High-pressure growth is a unique method to improve the sample quality and
size. Here, we have used the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis
(HP-HTS) method to grow CaKFe4As4 (1144) bulks and investigated their
superconducting properties using structural, microstructural, transport, and
magnetic studies. The microstructural analysis demonstrates that 1144 samples
prepared by HP-HTS have improved the sample density and grain connectivity. The
transition temperature (Tconset) of 1144 bulks prepared by HP-HTS is increased
up to 35.2 K with a transition width ({\Delta}T) of 1 K, which is remarkably
comparable to the reported 1144 single crystal. Additionally, the critical
current density (Jc) is enhanced by almost one order of magnitude compared with
the parent compound prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient
pressure (CSP), which could be attributed to the improved sample density and
effective pinning centers. Our study demonstrates that the sample quality and
superconducting properties of various iron-based superconductors can be
enhanced by applying the HP-HTS approach, and further research is demanded in
this direction.

<br>
<i>Karim Zongo, Hao Sun, Claudiane Ouellet-Plamondon, Laurent Karim Béland</i>
<p>Si and its oxides have been extensively explored in theoretical research due
to their technological and industrial importance. Simultaneously describing
interatomic interactions within both Si and SiO$_2$ without the use of
\textit{ab initio} methods is considered challenging, given the charge
transfers involved. Herein, this challenge is overcome by developing a unified
machine learning interatomic potentials describing the Si/ SiO$_2$/ O system,
based on the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. This MTP is trained using
a comprehensive database generated using density functional theory simulations,
encompassing a wide range of crystal structures, point defects, extended
defects, and disordered structure. Extensive testing of the MTP is performed,
indicating it can describe static and dynamic features of very diverse Si, O,
and SiO$_2$ atomic structures with a degree of fidelity approaching that of DFT

<p>An algorithm is described and tested that carries out a non negative matrix
factorization (NMF) ignoring any stretching of the signal along the axis of the
independent variable. This extended NMF model is called StretchedNMF.
Variability in a set of signals due to this stretching is then ignored in the
decomposition. This can be used, for example, to study sets of powder
diffraction data collected at different temperatures where the materials are
undergoing thermal expansion. It gives a more meaningful decomposition in this
case where the component signals resemble signals from chemical components in
the sample. The StretchedNMF model introduces a new variable, the stretching
factor, to describe any expansion of the signal. To solve StretchedNMF, we
discretize it and employ Block Coordinate Descent framework algorithms. The
initial experimental results indicate that StretchedNMF model outperforms the
conventional NMF for sets of data with such an expansion. A further enhancement
to StretchedNMF for the case of powder diffraction data from crystalline
materials called Sparse-StretchedNMF, which makes use of the sparsity of the
powder diffraction signals, allows correct extractions even for very small
stretches where StretchedNMF struggles. As well as demonstrating the model
performance on simulated PXRD patterns and atomic pair distribution functions
(PDFs), it also proved successful when applied to real data taken from an in
situ chemical reaction experiment.

<br>
<i>Colin Gilgenbach, Xi Chen, James M. LeBeau</i>
<p>While multislice electron ptychography can provide thermal-vibration limited
resolution and 3D information, it relies on the proper selection of many
intertwined experimental and computational parameters. Here, we outline a
theoretical basis for selecting experimental parameters to enable robust
ptychographic reconstructions. We develop a series of physically informed
metrics to describe the selection of experimental parameters in multislice
ptychography. Image simulations are used to comprehensively evaluate the
validity of these metrics over a broad range of experimental conditions. We
develop two metrics, areal oversampling and Ronchigram magnification, which
predict reconstruction success with high accuracy. Lastly, we validate these
conclusions with experimental ptychographic data, and demonstrate close
agreement between trends in simulated and experimental data. Using these
metrics, we achieve experimental multislice reconstructions at a scan step of
$1.0 \unit{\AA/px}$, enabling large field-of-view ($>\!18\unit{nm}$),
data-efficient reconstructions. These experimental design principles enable the
routine and reliable use of multislice ptychography for materials
characterization.

<h3>On the special oxidation mechanism of a Mg-Y-Al alloy contained LPSO  phase at high temperatures</h3>

<i>Zhipeng Wang, Zhao Shen, Yahuan Zhao, Qingchun Zhu, Yiwen Chen, Jingya Wang, Yangxin Li, Xiaoqin Zeng</i>
<p>This work investigated the oxidation of Mg-11Y-1Al alloy in Ar-20%O2 at
500{\deg}through multiscale characterization. The results show that the
network-like long-period stacking ordered(LPSO) phase decomposed into a
needle-like LPSO phase and a polygonal Mg24Y5 phase. The needle-like LPSO phase
resulted in the formation of a high-dense of needle-like oxide at the oxidation
front of the area initially occupied by the network-like LPSO phase. The
further inward oxygen would diffuse along the needle-like oxide-matrix
interfaces and react with Y in the surrounding Mg matrix, resulting in the
lateral growth of these needle-like oxides. Finally, the discrete needle-like
oxides were interconnected to form a thicker and continuous oxide scale which
could be more effective in hindering the elemental diffusion. Meanwhile, Al
could partially enter the Y2O3 oxide scale and formed a strengthened (Y,Al)O
oxide scale which could show a greater resistance to cracking and debonding.

<h3>Electric Field Switching of Magnon Spin Current in a Compensated  Ferrimagnet</h3>

<i>Kaili Li, Lei Wang, Yu Wang, Yuanjun Guo, Shuping Lv, Yuewei He, Weiwei Lin, Tai Min, Shaojie Hu, Sen Yang, Dezhen Xue, Aqun Zheng, Shuming Yang, Xiangdong Ding</i>
<p>Manipulation of directional magnon propagation, known as magnon spin current,
is essential for developing magnonic memory and logic devices featuring
nonvolatile functionalities and ultralow power consumption. Magnon spin current
can usually be modulated by magnetic field or current-induced spin torques.
However, these approaches may lead to energy dissipation caused by Joule
heating. Electric-field switching of magnon spin current without charge current
is highly desired but very challenging to realize. By integrating magnonic and
piezoelectric materials, we demonstrate manipulation of the magnon spin current
generated by the spin Seebeck effect in the ferrimagnetic insulator Gd3Fe5O12
(GdIG) film on a piezoelectric substrate. We observe reversible electric-field
switching of magnon polarization without applied charge current. Through
strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling, the electric field induces the
magnetic compensation transition between two magnetic states of the GdIG,
resulting in its magnetization reversal and the simultaneous switching of
magnon spin current. Our work establishes a prototype material platform that
pave the way for developing magnon logic devices characterized by all electric
field reading and writing and reveals the underlying physics principles of
their functions.

<i>Miao He, Xitong Xu, Ding Li, Qingqi Zeng, Yonglai Liu, Haitian Zhao, Shiming Zhou, Jianhui Zhou, Zhe Qu</i>
<p>Kagome materials have recently drawn great attention due to the interplay
between nontrivial band topology, electron correlations and van Hove
singularities related many-body orders. Here we report three new vanadium-based
kagome metals, TiV6Sn6, ZrV6Sn6 and HfV6Sn6, and conduct a comprehensive
investigation on their structural, magnetic and electrical transport
properties. All three compounds exhibit large unsaturated magnetoresistances
and multiband Hall effects at low temperatures, indicating the existence of
multiple highly mobile carriers. Both the diagonal and off-diagonal resistivity
show quantum oscillations with nontrivial Berry phases and high quantum
mobilities. First-principles calculations together with quantum oscillation
analyses suggest the van Hove singularities at the M point for the three
compounds all locate in close vicinity of the Fermi level, and there also exist
multiple topological nontrivial band crossings including a nodal ring and a
massive Dirac cone. Our work extends the kagome R166 family and paves the way
for searching possible van Hove physics in the V kagome lattice.

<h3>Thermodynamic Response and Neutral Excitations in Integer and Fractional  Quantum Anomalous Hall States Emerging from Correlated Flat Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15246</a>
<br>
<i>Hongyu Lu, Bin-Bin Chen, Han-Qing Wu, Kai Sun, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<p>Integer and fractional Chern insulators have been extensively explored in
correlated flat band models. Recently, the prediction and experimental
observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states with spontaneous
time-reversal-symmetry breaking have garnered attention. While the
thermodynamics of integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) states have been
systematically studied based on models of twisted bilayer graphene, our
theoretical knowledge on finite-temperature thermodynamic properties of FQAH
states has been severely limited. In this study, we delve into the
thermodynamic response and collective excitations of both IQAH and FQAH states
within the paradigmatic correlated flat band model on the checkerboard lattice.
Our key findings include: i) In both $\nu = 1$ IQAH and $\nu = 1/3$ FQAH
states, it is the charge-neutral collective excitations that determine the
onset temperature of these topological states, a value significantly smaller
than the charge gap, aligning with recent experimental observations; ii) The
lowest collective excitations manifest as the zero-momentum excitons in the
IQAH state, whereas in the FQAH state, they take the form of magneto-rotons
with finite momentum; iii) The excitons and rotons exhibit distinct
experimental signatures, which we propose to detect in future experiments.

<p>By an exact analytical approach we study the magnetothermal transport in the
spin-1/2 easy-axis Heisenberg model, in particular the thermal conductivity and
spin Seebeck effect as a function of anisotropy, magnetic field and
temperature. We stress a distinction between the commnon spin Seebeck effect
with fixed boundary conditions and the one (intrinsic) with open boundary
conditions. In the open boundary spin Seebeck effect we find exceptional
features at the critical fields between the low field antiferromagnetic phase,
the gapless one and the ferromagnetic at high fields. We further study the
development of these features as a function of easy-axis anisotropy and
temperature. We point out the potential of these results to experimental
studies in spin chain compounds, candidates for spin current generation in the
field of spintronics.

<h3>Transient vortex dynamics and evolution of Bose metal from a 2D  superconductor on MoS$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Sreevidya Narayanan, Anoop Kamalasanan, Annu Anns Sunny, Madhu Thalakulam</i>
<p>The true character of physical phenomena is thought to be reinforced as the
system becomes disorder-free. In contrast, the two-dimensional (2D)
superconductor is predicted to turn fragile and resistive away from the limit I
-> 0, B -> 0, in the pinning-free regime. It is intriguing to note that the
very vortices responsible for achieving superconductivity by pairing,
condensation, and, thereby reducing the classical dissipation, render the state
resistive driven by quantum fluctuations in the T -> 0. While cleaner systems
are being explored for technological improvements, the 2D superconductor
turning resistive when influenced by weak electric and magnetic fields has
profound consequences for quantum technologies. A metallic ground state in 2D
is beyond the consensus of both Bosonic and Fermionic systems, and its origin
and nature warrant a comprehensive theoretical understanding supplemented by
in-depth experiments. A real-time observation of the influence of vortex
dynamics on transport properties so far has been elusive. We explore the nature
and fate of a low-viscous, clean, 2D superconducting state formed on an
ionic-liquid gated few-layered MoS$_2$ sample. The vortex-core being
dissipative, the elastic depinning, intervortex interaction, and the subsequent
dynamics of the vortex-lattice cause the system to behave like an overdamped
harmonic oscillator, leaving transient signatures in the transport
characteristics. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transient
nature and the noise characteristics of the magnetoresistance confirm that
quantum fluctuations are solely responsible for the Bose metal state and the
fragility of the superconducting state.

center-of-mass position, in random growing planar clusters. Our examples are
taken from simulations of both continuous and discrete models of kinetically

<h3>Low-Temperature Transport Property of Spin-1/2 Random Heisenberg Chains</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuejiu Zhao, Long Zhang</i>
<p>Quenched disorders can strongly influence the physical properties of quantum
many-body systems. The real-space strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG)
analysis has shown that the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain is controlled by
the infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP) and forms a random singlet (RS)
ground state. Motivated by recent thermal transport experiments on the
quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet copper benzoate [B. Y. Pan et al, Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{129}$, 167201 (2022)], we adapt the SDRG to study the
low-temperature properties of the random Heisenberg chain by assuming that its
low-energy excited states are captured by the parent Hamiltonian of the RS
ground state as well. We find that while the specific heat coefficient and the
uniform magnetic susceptibility scale as $C/T\sim T^{-\alpha_{c}}$ and
$\chi\sim T^{-\alpha_{s}}$ with $0<\alpha_{c,s}<1$, indicating a divergent
low-energy density of states, the thermal and the spin conductivities scale as
$\kappa/T\sim T$ and $\sigma_{s}\sim T$, which implies a vanishing density of
extended states in the low-energy limit. We believe that such a disparity in
the thermodynamic and transport properties is a common feature of random
systems controlled by the IRFP.

<h3>Macroscopic fluctuation theory of local time in lattice gases</h3>

<br>
<i>Naftali R. Smith, Baruch Meerson</i>
<p>The local time in an ensemble of particles measures the amount of time the
particles spend in the vicinity of a given point in space. Here we study
fluctuations of this quantity, that is of the empirical time average
$R=\int_{0}^{T}\rho\left(x=0,t\right)\,dt$ of the density
$\rho\left(x=0,t\right)$ at the origin for an initially uniform one-dimensional
diffusive lattice gas. We consider both the quenched and annealed initial
conditions and employ the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT). For a gas of
non-interacting random walkers (RWs) the MFT yields exact large-deviation
functions of $R$, which are closely related to the ones recently obtained by
Burenev \textit{et al.} (2023) using microscopic calculations for
non-interacting Brownian particles. Our MFT calculations, however, additionally
yield the most likely history of the gas density $\rho(x,t)$ conditioned on a
given value of $R$. Furthermore, we calculate the variance of the local time
fluctuations for arbitrary particle- or energy-conserving diffusive lattice
gases. Better known examples of such systems include the simple symmetric
exclusion process, the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model and the symmetric
zero-range process. Our results for the non-interacting RWs can be readily
extended to a step-like initial condition for the density.

<p>Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is highly applicable in spintronic devices
such as magnetic sensors, magnetic memory, and hard drives. Typically, CMR is
found in Weyl semimetals characterized by perfect electron-hole symmetry or
exceptionally high electric conductivity and mobility. Our study explores this
phenomenon in a recently developed graphene moir$\acute{e}$ system, which
demonstrates CMR owing to its topological structure and high-quality crystal
formation. We specifically investigate the electronic properties of
three-dimensional (3D) intertwined twisted graphene spirals (TGS), manipulating
the screw dislocation axis to achieve a rotation angle of 7.3$^{\circ}$.
Notably, at 14 T and 2 K, the magnetoresistance of these structures reached
1.7$\times$10$^7$%, accompanied by an unexpected metal-to-insulator transition
as the temperature increased. This transition becomes noticeable when the
magnetic field exceeds a minimal threshold of approximately 0.1 T. These
observations suggest the existence of complex, correlated states within the
partially filled three-dimensional Landau levels of the 3D TGS system. Our
findings open up new possibilities for achieving CMR by engineering the
topological structure of 2D layered moir$\acute{e}$ systems.

<i>Kiryl Piasotski, Mikhail Pletyukhov, Alexander Shnirman</i>
<p>We develop Green's function formalism to describe continuous multi-layered
quasi-one-dimensional setups described by piece-wise constant single-particle
Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonians of the individual layers are assumed to be
quadratic polynomials in the momentum operator with matrix-valued
(multichannel) coefficients. This, in particular, allows one to study transport
in heterostructures consisting of multichannel conducting, superconducting, or
insulating components with band structures of arbitrary complexity. We find a
general expression for the single-particle Green's function of the combined
setup in terms of the bulk (translationally invariant) Green's functions of its
constituents. Furthermore, we provide the expression for the global density of
states of the combined system and establish the bound state equation in terms
of bulk Green's functions. We apply our formalism to investigate the spectrum
and current-phase relations in ordinary and topological Josephson junctions,
additionally showing how to account for the effects of static disorder and
local Coulomb interaction.

<p>Hybrid superconductor(S)-semiconductor(Sm) devices bring a range of new
functionalities into superconducting circuits. In particular, hybrid
parity-protected qubits and Josephson diodes were recently proposed and
experimentally demonstrated. Such devices leverage the non-sinusoidal character
of the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) in highly transparent S-Sm-S
junctions. Here we report an experimental study of superconducting
quantum-interference devices (SQUIDs) embedding Josephson field-effect
transistors fabricated from a SiGe/Ge/SiGe heterostructure grown on a 200-mm
silicon wafer. The single-junction CPR shows up to three harmonics with gate
tunable amplitude. In the presence of microwave irradiation, the ratio of the
first two dominant harmonics, corresponding to single and double Cooper-pair
transport processes, is consistently reflected in relative weight of integer
and half-integer Shapiro steps. A combination of magnetic-flux and gate-voltage
control enables tuning the SQUID functionality from a nonreciprocal
Josephson-diode regime with 27% asymmetry to a $\pi$-periodic Josephson regime
suitable for the implementation of parity-protected superconducting qubits.
These results illustrate the potential of Ge-based hybrid devices as versatile
and scalable building blocks of novel superconducting quantum circuits.

<p>Anomalous transport of topological semimetals has generated significant
interest for applications in optoelectronics, nanoscale devices, and
interconnects. Understanding the origin of novel transport is crucial to
engineering the desired material properties, yet their orders of magnitude
higher transport than single-particle mobilities remain unexplained. This work
demonstrates the dramatic mobility enhancements result from phonons primarily
returning momentum to electrons due to phonon-electron dominating over
phonon-phonon scattering. Proving this idea, proposed by Peierls in 1932,
requires tuning electron and phonon dispersions without changing symmetry,
topology, or disorder. This is achieved by combining de Haas - van Alphen
(dHvA), electron transport, Raman scattering, and first-principles calculations
in the topological semimetals MX$_2$ (M=Nb, Ta and X=Ge, Si). Replacing Ge with
Si brings the transport mobilities from an order magnitude larger than single
particle ones to nearly balanced. This occurs without changing the crystal
structure or topology and with small differences in disorder or Fermi surface.
Simultaneously, Raman scattering and first-principles calculations establish
phonon-electron dominated scattering only in the MGe$_2$ compounds. Thus, this
study proves that phonon-drag is crucial to the transport properties of
topological semimetals and provides insight to further engineer these
materials.

<p>Undesirable natural aging (NA) in Al-6xxx delays subsequent artificial aging
(AA) but the size, composition, and evolution of clustering are challenging to
measure. Here, atomistic details of early-stage clustering in Al-1\%Mg-0.6\%Si
during NA are studied computationally using a chemically-accurate
neural-network potential. Feasible growth paths for the preferred $\beta''$
precipitates identify: dominant clusters differing from $\beta''$ motifs;
spontaneous vacancy-interstitial formation creating 14-18 solute atom
$\beta''$-like motifs; and lower-energy clusters requiring chemical
re-arrangement to form $\beta''$ nuclei. Quasi-on-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations reveal that 8-14 solute atom clusters form within 1000 s but that
growth slows considerably due to vacancy trapping inside clusters, with
trapping energies of 0.3-0.5 eV. These findings rationalize why cluster growth
and alloy hardness saturate during NA, confirm the concept of ''vacancy
prisons", and suggest why clusters must be dissolved during AA before formation
of $\beta''$. This atomistic understanding of NA may enable design of
strategies to mitigate negative effects of NA.

<p>Machine Learning (ML) has impacted numerous areas of materials science, most
prominently improving molecular simulations, where force fields were trained on
previously relaxed structures. One natural next step is to predict material
properties beyond structure. In this work, we investigate the applicability and
explainability of ML methods in the use case of estimating the critical
temperature for magnetic Heusler alloys calculated using ab initio methods
determined materials-specific magnetic interactions and a subsequent Monte
Carlo (MC) approach. We compare the performance of regression and
classification models to predict the range of the critical temperature of given
compounds without performing the MC calculations. Since the MC calculation
requires computational resources in the same order of magnitude as the
density-functional theory (DFT) calculation, it would be advantageous to
replace either step with a less computationally intensive method such as ML. We
discuss the necessity to generate the magnetic ab initio results to make a
quantitative prediction of the critical temperature. We used state-of-the-art
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to extract physical relations
and deepen our understanding of patterns learned by our models from the
examined data.

<p>The increased availability of computing time, in recent years, allows for
systematic high-throughput studies of material classes with the purpose of both
screening for materials with remarkable properties and understanding how
structural configuration and material composition affect macroscopic attributes
manifestation. However, when conducting systematic high-throughput studies, the
individual ab initio calculations' success depends on the quality of the chosen
input quantities. On a large scale, improving input parameters by trial and
error is neither efficient nor systematic. We present a systematic,
high-throughput compatible, and machine learning-based approach to improve the
input parameters optimized during a DFT computation or workflow. This approach
of integrating machine learning into a typical high-throughput workflow
demonstrates the advantages and necessary considerations for a systematic study
of magnetic multilayers of 3$d$ transition metal layers on FCC noble metal
substrates. For 6660 film systems, we were able to improve the overall success
rate of our high-throughput FLAPW-based structural relaxations from $64.8 \%$
to $94.3\ \%$ while at the same time requiring $17\ \%$ less computational time
for each successful relaxation.

<h3>Exact transport coefficients from the inelastic rough Maxwell model of a  granular gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15440" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15440</a>
<br>
<i>Andrés Santos, Gilberto M. Kremer</i>
<p>Granular gases demand models capable of capturing their distinct
characteristics. The widely employed inelastic hard-sphere model (IHSM)
introduces complexities that are compounded when incorporating realistic
features like surface roughness and rotational degrees of freedom, resulting in
the more intricate inelastic rough hard-sphere model (IRHSM). This paper
focuses on the inelastic rough Maxwell model (IRMM), presenting a more
tractable alternative to the IRHSM and enabling exact solutions. Building on
the foundation of the inelastic Maxwell model (IMM) applied to granular gases,
the IRMM extends the mathematical representation to encompass surface roughness
and rotational degrees of freedom. The primary objective is to provide exact
expressions for the Navier--Stokes--Fourier transport coefficients within the
IRMM, including shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, cooling-rate transport
coefficient, thermal conductivity, and Dufour-like coefficient. In contrast to
earlier approximations in the IRHSM, our study unveils inherent couplings, such
as shear viscosity to spin viscosity and thermal conductivity to counterparts
associated with a cross flux vector. These exact findings provide valuable
insights into refining the Sonine approximation applied to the IRHSM,
contributing to a deeper understanding of the transport properties in granular
gases with realistic features.

<h3>Quantum Carnot thermal machines revisited: Definition of efficiency and  the effects of strong coupling</h3>

<br>
<i>Junjie Liu, Kenneth A. Jung</i>
<p>Whether the strong coupling to thermal baths can improve the performance of
quantum thermal machines remains an open issue under active debate. Here, we
revisit quantum thermal machines operating with the quasi-static Carnot cycle
and aim to unveil the role of strong coupling in maximum efficiency. Our
analysis builds upon definitions of excess work and heat derived from an exact
formulation of the first law of thermodynamics for the working substance, which
captures the non-Gibbsian thermal equilibrium state that emerges at strong
couplings during quasi-static isothermal processes. These excess definitions
differ from conventional ones by an energetic cost for maintaining the
non-Gibbsian characteristics. With this distinction, we point out that one can
introduce two different yet thermodynamically allowed definitions for
efficiency of both the heat engine and refrigerator modes. We dub them inside
and outside definitions which differ in the way of defining the gain for the
thermal machines at strong couplings by either just analyzing the energetics of
the working substance or instead evaluating the performance from an external
system upon which the thermal machine acts, respectively. We analytically
demonstrate that the inside definition predicts that the Carnot limit remains
the upper bound for both operation modes at strong couplings, whereas the
outside one reveals that strong coupling can suppress the maximum efficiency
rendering the Carnot limit unattainable. These seemingly incompatible
predictions thus indicate that it is imperative to first gauge the definition
for efficiency before elucidating the exact role of strong coupling, thereby
shedding light on the on-going investigation on strong-coupling quantum thermal
machines.

<p>Photoluminescence Quenching Simulator (PLQ-Sim) is a user-friendly software
to study the photoexcited state dynamics at the interface between two organic
semiconductors forming a blend: an electron donor (D), and an electron acceptor
(A). Its main function is to provide substantial information on the
photophysical processes relevant to organic photovoltaic and photothermal
devices, such as charge transfer state formation and subsequent free charge
generation or exciton recombination. From input parameters provided by the
user, the program calculates the transfer rates of the D/A blend and employs a
kinetic model that provides the photoluminescence quenching efficiency for
initial excitation in the donor or acceptor. When calculating the rates, the
user can choose to use disorder parameters to better describe the system. In
addition, the program was developed to address energy transfer phenomena that
are commonly present in organic blends. The time evolution of state populations
is also calculated providing relevant information for the user. In this
article, we present the theory behind the kinetic model, along with suggestions
for methods to obtain the input parameters. A detailed demonstration of the
program, its applicability, and an analysis of the outputs are also presented.

<h3>Unexpected Field Evaporation Sequence in $γ$-TiAl</h3>

<i>Jiayuwen Qi, Fei Xue, Emmanuelle Marquis, Wolfgang Windl</i>
<p>In atom probe tomography (APT), atoms from the surface of a needle shape
specimen are evaporated under a high electric field and analyzed via time of
flight mass spectrometry and position sensitive detection. 3D reconstruction of
the atom positions follows a simple projection law, which can sometimes lead to
artifacts due to deviation from an assumed ideal evaporation sequence. Here, we
revisit the evaporation behavior of [001]-oriented $\gamma$-TiAl using a
full-dynamics simulation approach empowered by molecular dynamics. Without any
knowledge of charge states or assumptions about evaporation fields, we
successfully reproduced the lack of distinct Al and Ti layers observed in
reconstructions of experimental data which is traditionally attributed to the
retention of Al on the evaporating surface. We further showed that a step-wise
bond breaking process of Ti in contrast to the simultaneous bond breaking of Al
explains the seemingly counterintuitive preferential evaporation of the
strongly bonded Ti atoms.

<h3>Effects of a rotating periodic lattice on coherent quantum states in a  ring topology: The case of negative nonlinearity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15479" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15479</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Tekverk, Christopher Siebor, Kunal K. Das</i>
<p>We study the spectrum and stationary states in a ring-shaped lattice
potential in the context of ultracold atoms with attractive interatomic
interactions. We determine analytical solutions in the absence of a lattice by
mapping them to those for repulsive interactions, and then we numerically
follow the transformation of those solutions as the lattice is introduced and
strengthened. Several features emerge that are specific to negative
nonlinearity, that include: Soliton branches detaching to create new ground
states; gaps opening up at the bottom of the primary spectral branch; multiple
splitting and rejoining of some branches. We correlate the spectral features
with the behavior of the density and phase of the corresponding eigenstates,
and track them along branches and as various system parameters change. We find
that the phase is sensitive to how a specific point in the spectrum is
approached, particularly relevant at certain persistent gaps in the spectrum.
The symmetry and stability properties are generally found to be opposite of
that found for repulsive interactions.

<h3>Chemical Potential of a Flexible Polymer Liquid in a Coarse-Grained  Representation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15481" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15481</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammadhasan Dinpajooh, Jonathan Millis, James Donley, Marina G. Guenza</i>
<p>While the excess chemical potential is the key quantity in determining phase
diagrams, its direct computation for high-density liquids of long polymer
chains has posed a significant challenge. Computationally, the excess chemical
potential is calculated using the Widom insertion method, which involves
monitoring the change in internal energy as one incrementally introduces
individual molecules in the liquid. However, when dealing with dense polymer
liquids, inserting long chains requires generating trial configurations with a
bias that favors those at low energy on a unit-by-unit basis: a procedure that
becomes more challenging as the number of units increases. Thus, calculating
the excess chemical potential of dense polymer liquids using this method
becomes computationally intractable as the chain length exceeds $N > 30$. Here,
we adopt a coarse-grained model derived from integral equation theory, for
which inserting long polymer chains becomes feasible. The Integral Equation
theory of Coarse-Graining (IECG) represents a polymer as a sphere or a
collection of blobs interacting through a soft potential. We employ the IECG
approach to compute the excess chemical potential using Widom's method for
polymer chains of increasing lengths, extending up to $N=720$ monomers, and at
densities reaching up to $\rho= 0.767$ g/cm$^{3}$. From a fundamental
perspective, we demonstrate that the excess chemical potentials remain nearly
constant across various levels of coarse-graining, offering valuable insights
into the consistency of this type of procedure. Ultimately, we argue that
current Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, originally designed for atomistic
simulations, such as Configurational Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) methods, can
significantly benefit from the integration of the IECG approach, thereby
enhancing their performance in the study of phase diagrams of polymer liquids.

<h3>From Prediction to Action: The Critical Role of Proper Performance  Estimation for Machine-Learning-Driven Materials Discovery</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15549</a>
<br>
<i>Mario Boley, Felix Luong, Simon Teshuva, Daniel F Schmidt, Lucas Foppa, Matthias Scheffler</i>
<p>Materials discovery driven by statistical property models is an iterative
decision process, during which an initial data collection is extended with new
data proposed by a model-informed acquisition function--with the goal to
maximize a certain "reward" over time, such as the maximum property value
discovered so far. While the materials science community achieved much progress
in developing property models that predict well on average with respect to the
training distribution, this form of in-distribution performance measurement is
not directly coupled with the discovery reward. This is because an iterative
discovery process has a shifting reward distribution that is
over-proportionally determined by the model performance for exceptional
materials. We demonstrate this problem using the example of bulk modulus
maximization among double perovskite oxides. We find that the in-distribution
predictive performance suggests random forests as superior to Gaussian process
regression, while the results are inverse in terms of the discovery rewards. We
argue that the lack of proper performance estimation methods from pre-computed
data collections is a fundamental problem for improving data-driven materials
discovery, and we propose a novel such estimator that, in contrast to na\"ive
reward estimation, successfully predicts Gaussian processes with the "expected
improvement" acquisition function as the best out of four options in our
demonstrational study for double perovskites. Importantly, it does so without
requiring the over thousand ab initio computations that were needed to confirm
this prediction.

<h3>Non-Bloch band theory of generalized eigenvalue problems</h3>

<br>
<i>Kazuki Yokomizo, Taiki Yoda, Yuto Ashida</i>
<p>Waves in a variety of fields in physics, such as mechanics, optics,
spintronics, and nonlinear systems, obey generalized eigenvalue equations. To
study non-Hermitian physics of those systems, in this work, we construct a
non-Bloch band theory of generalized eigenvalue problems. Specifically, we show
that eigenvalues of a transfer matrix lead to a certain condition imposed on
the generalized Brillouin zone, which allows us to develop a theory to
calculate the continuum bands. As a concrete example, we examine the
non-Hermitian skin effect of photonic crystals composed of chiral metamaterials
by invoking our theoretical framework. When the medium has circularly polarized
eigenmodes, we find that each eigenmode localizes at either of edges depending
on whether it is left- or right-circularly polarized. In contrast, when the
medium only has linearly polarized eigenmodes, every eigenmode localizes to the
edge of the same side independent of its polarization. We demonstrate that the
localization lengths of those eigenmodes can be determined from the chiral
parameters and eigenfrequencies of the photonic crystal.

<h3>One-dimensional moire chains with partially-filled flat bands in  two-dimensional twisted bilayer WSe2</h3>

<br>
<i>Ya-Ning Ren, Hui-Ying Ren, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Lin He</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) moire systems based on twisted bilayer graphene and
transition metal dichalcogenides provide a promising platform to investigate
emergent phenomena driven by strong electron-electron interactions in
partially-filled flat bands1-11. A natural question arises: is it possible to
expand the 2D correlated moire physics to one-dimensional (1D)? This requires
selectively doping of 1D moire chain embedded in the 2D moire systems, which is
an outstanding challenge in experiment and seems to be not within the grasp of
today's technology. Therefore, an experimental demonstration of the 1D moire
chain with partially-filled flat bands remains absent. Here we show that we can
introduce 1D boundaries, separating two regions with different twist angles, in
twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2) by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and
demonstrate that the flat bands of moire sites along the 1D boundaries can be
selectively filled. The charge and discharge states of correlated moire
electrons in the 1D moire chain can be directly imaged and manipulated by
combining a back-gate voltage with the STM bias. Our results open the door for
realizing new correlated electronic states of the 1D moire chain in 2D systems.

<h3>The influence of pinholes and weak-points in aluminium-oxide Josephson  junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>K. Bayros, M. J. Cyster, J. S. Smith, J. H. Cole</i>
<p>Josephson junctions are the key components used in superconducting qubits for
quantum computing. The advancement of quantum computing is limited by a lack of
stability and reproducibility of qubits which ultimately originates in the
amorphous tunnel barrier of the Josephson junctions and other material
imperfections. Pinholes in the junction have been suggested as one of the
possible contributors to these instabilities, but evidence of their existence
and the effect they might have on transport is unclear. We use molecular
dynamics to create three-dimensional atomistic models to describe Al-AlOx-Al
tunnel junctions, showing that pinholes form when oxidation of the barrier is
incomplete. Following this we use the atomistic model and simulate the
electronic transport properties for tunnel junctions with different barrier
thicknesses using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. We observe
that pinholes may contribute to excess quasiparticle current flow in Al-AlOx-Al
tunnel junctions with thinner barriers, and in thicker barriers we observe
weak-points which facilitate leakage currents even when the oxide is
continuous. We find that the disordered nature of the amorphous barrier results
in significant variations in the transport properties. Additionally, we
determine the current-phase relationship for our atomistic structures,
confirming that devices with pinholes and weak-points cause a deviation from
the ideal sinusoidal Josephson relationship.

<h3>Effects of a rotating periodic lattice on coherent quantum states in a  ring topology: The case of positive nonlinearity</h3>

<br>
<i>Hongyi Huang, Kunal K. Das</i>
<p>We study the landscape of solutions of the coherent quantum states in a ring
shaped lattice potential in the context of ultracold atoms with an effective
positive nonlinearity induced by interatomic interactions. The exact analytical
solutions in the absence of lattice are used as a starting point and the
transformation of those solutions is mapped as the lattice is introduced and
strengthened. This approach allows a simple classification of all the solutions
into states with periods commensurate/incommensruate with the lattice period
and those with/without nodes. Their origins are traced to the primary
dispersion curve and the swallowtail branches of the lattice-free spectrum. The
commensurate states tend to remain delocalized with increasing lattice depth,
whereas the incommensurate ones may be localized. The symmetry and stability
properties of the solutions are examined and correlated with branch energies.
The crucial importance of rotation is highlighted by its utility in
continuously transforming solutions and accessing in a finite ring with a few
sites the full spectrum of nonlinear Bloch waves on an infinite lattice.

<h3>Unconventional superconductivity and paramagnetic Meissner response  triggered by nonlocal pairing interaction in proximitized heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<i>A. A. Kopasov, A. S. Mel'nikov</i>
<p>Proximity phenomena and induced superconducting correlations in
heterostructures are shown to be strongly affected by the nonlocal nature of
the electronic attraction. The latter can trigger the formation of Cooper pairs
consisting of electrons localized in neighbouring layers even in the absence of
direct quasiparticle transfer between the layers. We investigate the
manifestations of such nonlocal pairing and resulting unconventional induced
superconductivity in an exemplary two-dimensional (2D) electronic system
coupled to a conventional superconductor. The interplay between the
quasiparticle tunneling and spin-triplet interlayer pairing is shown to
generate the odd-frequency superconducting correlations in the 2D material
which give rise to the paramagnetic contribution to the Meissner response and
affect the energy resolved quasiparticle density of states. Experimental
evidence for the above nonlocal interface pairing would provide new
perspectives in engineering the unconventional superconducting correlations in
heterostructures.

<i>A. A. Kopasov, Zh. Devizorova, H. Meng, S. V. Mironov, A. S. Mel'nikov, A. I. Buzdin</i>
<p>We study the distinctive features of the phase pumping effect in Josephson
transport through a three-layered ferromagnet F$_1$/F/F$_2$ with non-coplanar
magnetization. Using Gor'kov and Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalisms we go beyond
the quasiclassical approximation and analyze the dependence of the spontaneous
Josephson phase $\psi$ on the exchange field $h$ in the F layer and details of
magnetization profile. The pumping of the Josephson phase can be generated by
the mutual rotation of magnetizations in F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers resulting in
the nontrivial phase gain at the rotation period (Berry phase). The increase in
$h$ is shown to cause changes in the topology of the phase evolution: the gain
of the Josephson phase at the pumping period switches from $0$ to $2\pi$. We
study the scenario of these switchings originating from the interplay between
several competing local minima of the free energy of the junction versus the
superconducting phase difference. Our analysis provides the basis for the
search of experimental setup realizing the phase pumping phenomenon.

<p>A coupled chain of superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) with
anomalous ground phase shift represents a system realizing long-range
interaction between magnetic moments of the weak links. The interaction is of
magnetoelectric origin and is mediated by the condensate phase of
superconductors. The system is a paradigmic platform for investigation of
collective magnetic states governed by the superconducting phase. Here we study
the magnetic eigenmodes of such a system and demonstrate that the
eigenfrequencies are determined by the magnetic configuration of the whole
system and are controlled by the superconducting phase. Depending on the
orientation of the magnetic easy axis the eigenmodes can be very different
ranging from individual oscillations of different magnets to highly-cooperative
behavior.

<h3>How concerted are ionic hops in inorganic solid-state electrolytes?</h3>

<br>
<i>Cibrán López, Riccardo Rurali, Claudio Cazorla</i>
<p>Despite being fundamental to the understanding of solid-state electrolytes
(SSE), little is known on the degree of coordination between mobile ions in
diffusive events. Thus far, identification of concerted ionic hops mostly has
relied on the analysis of spatio-temporal pair correlation functions obtained
from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, this type of
analysis neither allows for quantifying particle correlations beyond two body
nor determining concerted ionic hop mechanisms, thus hindering a detailed
comprehension and possible rational design of SSE. Here, we introduce an
unsupervised k-means clustering approach able to identify ion-hopping events
and correlations between many mobile ions, and apply it to a comprehensive ab
initio MD database comprising several families of inorganic SSE and millions of
ionic configurations. It is found that despite two-body interactions between
mobile ions are largest, higher-order $n$-ion ($2 < n$) correlations are most
frequent. Specifically, we prove an universal exponential decaying law for the
probability density function governing the number of concerted mobile ions. For
the particular case of Li-based SSE, it is shown that the average number of
correlated mobile ions amounts to $10 \pm 5$ and that this result is
practically independent of temperature. Interestingly, our data-driven analysis
reveals that fast-ion diffusion strongly and positively correlates with ample
hopping lengths and long hopping spans but not with high hopping frequencies
and short interstitial residence times. Finally, it is shown that neglection of
many-ion correlations generally leads to a modest overestimation of the hopping
frequency that roughly is proportional to the average number of correlated
mobile ions.

<i>Giada Franceschi, Andrea Conti, Luca Lezuo, Rainer Abart, Florian Mittendorfer, Michael Schmid, Ulrike Diebold</i>
<p>Microcline feldspar (KAlSi$_3$O$_8$) is a common mineral with important roles
for Earth's ecological balance. It participates in the carbon, potassium, and
water cycles, contributing to CO$_2$ sequestration, soil formation, and
atmospheric ice nucleation. To understand the fundamentals of these processes,
it is essential to establish microcline's surface atomic structure and its
interaction with the omnipresent water molecules. This work presents
atomic-scale results on microcline's lowest-energy surface and its interaction
with water, combining ultrahigh vacuum investigations by non-contact atomic
force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with density functional
theory calculations. An ordered array of hydroxyls bonded to silicon or
aluminum readily forms on the cleaved surface at room temperature. The distinct
proton affinities of these hydroxyls influence the arrangement and orientation
of the first water molecules binding to the surface, holding potential
implications for the subsequent condensation of water.

<br>
<i>Lukas Hecht, Iris Dong, Benno Liebchen</i>
<p>If two phases of a certain material exist at the same time, e.g., a gas and a
liquid, they have the same temperature. This fundamental law of equilibrium
physics is known to apply even to many non-equilibrium systems. However,
recently, there has been much attention in the finding that inertial
self-propelled particles like Janus colloids in a plasma, microflyers, or
beetles at interfaces could self-organize into a hot gas-like phase that
coexists with a colder liquid-like phase. Here, we show that a kinetic
temperature difference across coexisting phases can occur even in equilibrium
systems when adding generic (overdamped) self-propelled particles. In this
case, surprisingly, we find that the dense phase (liquid) cannot only be colder
but also hotter than the dilute phase (gas). This generic effect hinges on
correlated events where active particles collectively push and heat up passive
ones, which can overcompensate their collision-induced energy loss locally. Our
results answer the fundamental question if a non-equilibrium gas can be colder
than a coexisting liquid and create a route to equip matter with self-organized
domains of different kinetic temperatures.

<h3>Current and shot noise in a spin dependent driven normal metal -- BCS  superconductor junction</h3>

<br>
<i>Bruno Bertin-Johannet, Benoît Grémaud, Flavio Ronneti, Laurent Raymond, Jérôme Rech, Thibaut Jonckheere, Thierry Martin</i>
<p>Andreev reflection is a fundamental transport process occurring at the
junction between a normal metal and a superconductor (a N-S junction), when an
incident electron from the normal side can only be transmitted in the
superconductor as a Cooper pair, with the reflection of a hole in the normal
metal. As a consequence of the spin singlet nature of the BCS Cooper pairs, the
current due to Andreev reflection at a N-S junction is always symmetric in
spin. Using a Keldysh Nambu Floquet approach, combining analytical and
numerical calculations, we study in details the AC transport at a N-S junction,
when the two spin components in the normal metal are driven by different
periodic drives. We show that, in the Andreev regime, i.e. when the
superconducting gap is much larger than the frequency of the drives, the
spin-resolved photo-assisted currents are always equal even if the two drives
are different. In addition, we show that in this regime the excess noise
depends only on the sum of the periodic drives, and we consider in particular
the case of Lorentzian pulses (Levitons). We also show how these properties get
modified when going beyond the Andreev regime. Finally we give a simple
analytical proof of the special properties of the Andreev regime using an exact
mapping to a particular N-N junction.

<h3>Type-II topological phase transitions of topological skyrmion phases</h3>

<br>
<i>Reyhan Ay, Joe H. Winter, A. M. Cook</i>
<p>We present minimal toy models for topological skyrmion phases of matter,
which generically realize type-II topological phase transitions in effectively
non-interacting systems, those which occur without closing of the minimum
direct bulk energy gap. We study the bulk-boundary correspondence in detail to
show that a non-trivial skyrmion number yields a rich bulk-boundary
correspondence. We observe gapless edge states, which are robust against
disorder, due to non-trivial skyrmion number. Edge states corresponds to bands,
which do not traverse the bulk gap, instead yielding gaplessness due to their
overlap in energy and exponential localization on opposite edges of the system.
These gapless boundary modes can occur for total Chern number zero, and
furthermore correspond to rich real-space spin textures with strong
polarization of spin along the real-space edge. By introducing toy models
generically exhibiting type-II topological phase transitions and characterizing
the bulk-boundary correspondence due to non-trivial skyrmion number in these
models, we lay the groundwork for understanding consequences of the quantum
skyrmion Hall effect.

<p>Atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to gain atomic-scale insights into
the heteroepitaxy of lanthanum-strontium manganite (LSMO,
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3-{\delta}}$, $x$ $\approx$ 0.2) on SrTiO$_3$(110). LSMO
is a perovskite oxide characterized by several composition-dependent surface
reconstructions. The flexibility of the surface allows it to incorporate
nonstoichiometries during growth, which result in composition-dependent surface
atomic structures. This happens up to a critical point, where phase separation
occurs, clusters rich in the excess cations form at the surface, and films show
a rough morphology. To limit the nonstoichiometry introduced by non-optimal
growth conditions, it proves useful to monitor the changes in surface atomic
structures as a function of the PLD parameters and tune the latter accordingly.

<h3>Tabular Two-Dimensional Correlation Analysis for Multifaceted  Characterization Data</h3>

<i>Shun Muroga, Satoshi Yamazaki, Koji Michishio, Hideaki Nakajima, Takahiro Morimoto, Nagayasu Oshima, Kazufumi Kobashi, Toshiya Okazaki</i>
<p>We propose tabular two-dimensional correlation analysis for extracting
features from multifaceted characterization data, essential for understanding
material properties. This method visualizes similarities and phase lags in
structural parameter changes through heatmaps, combining hierarchical
clustering and asynchronous correlations. We applied the proposed method to
datasets of carbon nanotube (CNTs) films annealed at various temperatures and
revealed the complexity of their hierarchical structures, which include
elements like voids, bundles, and amorphous carbon. Our analysis addresses the
challenge of attempting to understand the sequence of structural changes,
especially in multifaceted characterization data where 11 structural parameters
derived from 8 characterization methods interact with complex behavior. The
results show how phase lags (asynchronous changes from stimuli) and parameter
similarities can illuminate the sequence of structural changes in materials,
providing insights into phenomena like the removal of amorphous carbon and
graphitization in annealed CNTs. This approach is beneficial even with limited
data and holds promise for a wide range of material analyses, demonstrating its
potential in elucidating complex material behaviors and properties.

<h3>Positive magnetoresistance in anapole superconductor junctions</h3>

<i>Tim Kokkeler, Yukio Tanaka, Alexander Golubov</i>
<p>The article presents a method to detect time-reversal symmetry breaking in
non-centrosymmetric superconductors using only transport measurements.
Specifically, if time-reversal symmetry is broken via a phase difference
between singlet and triplet correlations, as in anapole superconductors, the
conductance in SFN junctions is enhanced by increasing the exchange field
strength in the ferromagnet. This is in sharp contrast with the negative
magnetoresistance when using superconductors in which time reversal symmetry is
preserved. Moreover, results show a large quadrupolar component of the
magnetoresistance which is qualitatively different from the bipolar giant
magnetoresistance in strong ferromagnets.

<p>The recently discovered superconductivity with critical temperature $T_{c}$
up to 80 K in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under
pressure has drawn great attention. Here we report the positive muon spin
relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) study of polycrystalline La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$
under ambient pressure. The zero-field $\mu^+$SR experiments reveal the
existence of static long range magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$,
and the the muon spin depolarization spectra are consistent with the spin
density wave internal field distribution. The weak transverse field $\mu^+$SR
measurements suggest the bulk magnetic transition near $T_{\rm{N}}=148$ K. This
is the first research which discovers the existence of the spin density wave in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ microscopically.

<i>Y. del Castillo, J. Fernández-Rossier</i>
<p>The emergence of effective $S=1/2$ spins at the edges of $S=1$ Haldane spin
chains is one of the simplest examples of fractionalization. Whereas there is
indirect evidence of this phenomenon, direct measurement of the magnetic moment
of an individual edge spin remains to be done. Here we show how scanning tunnel
microscopy electron-spin resonance (ESR-STM) can be used to map the stray field
created by the fractional $S=1/2$ edge spin and we propose efficient methods to
invert the Biot-Savart equation, obtaining the edge magnetization map. This
permits one to determine unambiguously the two outstanding emergent properties
of fractional degrees of freedom, namely, their fractional magnetic moment and
their localization length $\xi$.

<h3>Electron correlation mediated site-selective charge compensation in  polar/non-polar heterointerface</h3>

<p>One of the boundary conditions of the classical electromagnetic theory
demands continuous electric potential across any boundary, which may not be
naturally satisfied in atomically engineered heterostructures. Such polarity
mismatch in oxide heterointerfaces is compensated through some
(electronic/chemical/structural) reconstructions, leading to a myriad of
emergent phenomena. The question we are posing is whether conventional
semiconductor band bending framework is sufficient to comprehend compensation
mechanisms in oxide heterostructures since, unlike semiconductors, complex
oxides host strong electron correlations whose effects are indispensable. To
address this, we investigate the interface between a prototypical insulating
double perovskite Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and a wide-bandgap insulator SrTiO$_3$. This
polar/non-polar interface offers a similar scenario as the famous
LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system but with an exception - two transition metal sites
with two individual correlated energy scales. By combining several experimental
techniques and density functional theory, we establish a site-selective charge
compensation process that occurs explicitly at the Mn site of the film, leaving
the Ni sites inert. This surprising selectivity, which cannot be accounted by
existing polar compensation mechanisms, is directly attributed to the TM
cations' relative correlation energy scales. This discovery presents that
site-specific charge compensation can be a designers tool for tailoring
emergent phenomena in oxide heterostructures.

<p>We report on neutron scattering measurements on the vortex lattice of the
noncentrosymmetric superconductor BiPd. We observe the existence of the
intermediate mixed state, a region where Meissner and vortex lattice phases
coexist, which is a feature of low $\kappa$ Type-II superconductors. Following
this, we obtain an estimate of the value of $\kappa$ using the extended London
model, which confirms the expectation that $\kappa$ should be small. Finally,
we find that the temperature dependence of the vortex lattice form factor fits
well to a model designed to describe singlet-triplet mixing in
non-centrosymmetric superconductors, which may shed light on the question of
the gap structure in BiPd.

<p>We formulate a Majorana mean-field theory for the extended $JK\Gamma$ Kitaev
model in a magnetic Zeeman field of arbitrary direction, and apply it for
studying spatially inhomogeneous states harboring vortices. This mean-field
theory is exact in the pure Kitaev limit and captures the essential physics
throughout the Kitaev spin liquid phase. We determine the charge profile around
vortices and the corresponding quadrupole tensor. The quadrupole-quadrupole
interaction between distant vortices is shown to be either repulsive or
attractive, depending on parameters. We predict that electrically biased
scanning probe tips enable the creation of vortices at preselected positions.
Our results open new perspectives for the electric manipulation of Ising anyons

<p>The diverse spectrum of material characteristics including band gap,
mechanical moduli, color, phonon and electronic density of states, along with
catalytic and surface properties are intricately intertwined with the atomic
structure and the corresponding interatomic bond-lengths. This interconnection
extends to the manifestation of interplanar spacings within a crystalline
lattice. Analysis of these interplanar spacings and the comprehension of any
deviations, whether it be lattice compression or expansion, commonly referred
to as strain, hold paramount significance in unraveling various unknowns within
the field. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is widely used to capture
atomic-scale ordering, facilitating direct investigation of interplanar
spacings. However, creating critical contour maps for visualizing and
interpreting lattice stresses in TEM images remains a challenging task. Here we
developed a Python code for TEM image processing that can handle a wide range
of materials including nanoparticles, 2D materials, pure crystals and solid
solutions. This algorithm converts local differences in interplanar spacings
into contour maps allowing for a visual representation of lattice expansion and
compression. The tool is very generic and can significantly aid in analyzing
material properties using TEM images, allowing for a more in-depth exploration
of the underlying science behind strain engineering via strain contour maps at
the atomic level.

<i>Shu-Wei Liu, Joe H. Winter, A. M. Cook</i>
<p>We introduce topological skyrmion semimetal phases of matter, characterized
by bulk electronic structures with topological defects in ground state
observable textures over the Brillouin zone (BZ), rather than topological
degeneracies in band structures. We present and characterize toy models for
these novel topological phases, focusing on realizing such topological defects
in the ground state spin expectation value texture over the BZ. We find
generalized Fermi arc bulk-boundary correspondences and chiral anomaly response
signatures, including Fermi arc-like states which do not terminate with
topological band structure degeneracies in the bulk, but rather with
topological defects in the spin texture of bulk insulators. We also consider
novel boundary conditions for topological semimetals, in which the 3D bulk is
mapped to a 2D bulk plus 0D defect. Given the experimental significance of
topological semimetals, our work paves the way to broad experimental study of
topological skyrmion phases and the quantum skyrmion Hall effect.

<h3>General corner charge formulas in various tetrahedral and cubic space  groups</h3>

<br>
<i>Hidetoshi Wada, Katsuaki Naito, Seishiro Ono, Ken Shiozaki, Shuichi Murakami</i>
<p>In some insulators, corner charges are fractionally quantized, due to the
topological invariant called a filling anomaly. The previous theories of
fractional corner charges have been mostly limited to two-dimensional systems.
In three dimensions, only limited cases have been studied. In this study, we
derive formulas for the filling anomaly and the corner charge in various
crystals with all the tetrahedral and cubic space groups. We discuss that the
quantized corner charge requires the crystal shapes to be vertex-transitive
polyhedra. We show that the formula of the filling anomaly is universally given
by the difference between electronic and ionic charges at the Wyckoff position
1a. The fractional corner charges appear by equally distributing the filling
anomaly to all the corners of the crystal. We also derive the k-space formulas
for the fractional corner charge. In some cases, the corner charge is not
determined solely from the irreps at high-symmetry k-points. In such cases, we
introduce a new Z2 topological invariant to determine the corner charge.

<h3>Work distribution of a colloid in an elongational flow field and under  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15768</a>
<br>
<i>Debasish Saha, Rati Sharma</i>
<p>The study of thermodynamic properties of microscopic systems, such as a
colloid in a fluid, has been of great interest to researchers since the
discovery of the fluctuation theorem and associated laws of stochastic
thermodynamics. However, most of these studies confine themselves to systems
where effective fluctuations acting on the colloid are in the form of
delta-correlated Gaussian white noise (GWN). In this study, instead, we look
into the work distribution function when a colloid trapped in a harmonic
potential moves from one position to another in a fluid medium with an
elongational flow field where the effective fluctuations are given by the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise, a type of coloured noise. We use path integrals
to calculate this distribution function and compare and contrast its properties
to the case with GWN. We find that the work distribution function turns out to
be non-Gaussian as a result of the elongational flow field, but continues to
obey the fluctuation theorem in both types of noise. Further, we also look into
the effects of the various system parameters on the behaviour of work
fluctuations and find that although the distribution tends to broaden with
increasing noise intensity, increased correlation in fluctuations acts to
oppose this effect. Additionally, the system is found to consume heat from the
surroundings at early times and dissipate it into the media at later times.
This study, therefore, is a step towards gaining a better understanding of the
thermodynamic properties of colloidal systems under non-linear complex flows
that also display correlated fluctuations.

<p>A unitary Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is predicted to show scale
and conformal symmetry that have important consequences in its thermodynamic
and dynamical properties. By experimentally realizing an isotropic harmonic
trap, we study the expansion of a unitary Fermi gas and demonstrate its
universal expansion dynamics along different directions and at different
temperatures. We show that as a consequence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the measured
release energy is equal to that of the trapping energy. In addition, away from
resonance when scale invariance is broken, we determine the effective exponent
$\gamma$ that relates the chemical potential and average density along the
BEC-BCS crossover, which qualitatively agrees with the mean field predictions.
This work opens the possibility of studying non-equilibrium dynamics in a
conformal invariant system in the future.

<h3>Topological Thermal Hall Conductance of Even Denominator Fractional  States</h3>

<br>
<i>Arup Kumar Paul, Priya Tiwari, Ron Melcer, Vladimir Umansky, Moty Heiblum</i>
<p>The even denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states $\nu=5/2$ and
$\nu=7/2$, have been long predicted to host non-abelian quasiparticles (QPs).
The presence of energy-carrying neutral modes cripples customary conductance
measurements and thus motivates thermal transport measurements, which already
proved to be sensitive to all energy-carrying modes. Each state has a different
capacity to carry quanta of heat - as expressed by the so-called: 'central
charge' - identifying the state's topological order. While the 'two-terminal'
thermal conductance measurements identified the topological orders of abelian
and non-abelian QH states, they are prone to partial thermal equilibration
among counter-propagating modes. Here, we report a 'four-terminal' thermal Hall
conductance measurement, which separately measures the heat carried by the
downstream and upstream chiral modes. This measurement is insensitive to
thermal equilibration among modes. We verify that the $\nu=5/2$ and $\nu=7/2$
states are non-abelian, supporting a single upstream Majorana mode, thus
obeying the Particle-Hole Pfaffian topological order. While current numerical
works predict a different central charge, this contribution should motivate
further theoretical work.

<i>Xuanbo Feng, Liam Farrar, Charles J. Sayers, Simon J. Bending, Enrico Da Como, Erik van Heumen</i>
<p>The layered van der Waals material, TaS$_{2}$ features a meta-stable mosaic
phase on the verge of a nearly commensurate to commensurate charge density wave
transition. This meta-stable or 'hidden' phase can be reached by laser pumping
the low temperature, commensurate charge density wave phase. Here we report the
stabilization of a bulk, equilibrium mosaic phase in 1T-TaS$_{1.2}$Se$_{0.8}$
single crystals observed with transport and optical spectroscopy experiments.
We identify a bulk pseudogap in the mosaic phase of approximately 200 meV at
the lowest temperatures, while the CCDW phase can be obtained by heating and
instead has a full optical gap of about 100 meV. Surprisingly, a spectral
weight analysis shows that Se doping gives rise to an increased charge density
despite the fact that this is formally an isovalent substitution. This finding
is consistent with the recent observation that the mosaic phase is stabilized
as equilibrium phase through the appearance of charged defects.

<h3>Multifractality and statistical localization in highly heterogeneous  random networks</h3>

<i>Diego Tapias, Peter Sollich</i>
<p>We consider highly heterogeneous random networks with symmetric interactions
in the limit of high connectivity. A key feature of this system is that the
spectral density of the corresponding ensemble exhibits a divergence within the
bulk. We study the structure of the eigenvectors associated with this
divergence and find that they are multifractal with the statistics of
eigenvector elements matching those of the resolvent entries. The corresponding
localization mechanism relies on the statistical properties of the nodes rather
than on any spatial structure around a localization centre. This "statistical
localization" mechanism is potentially relevant for explaining localization in
different models that display singularities in the bulk of the spectrum of
eigenvalues

<i>Seishiro Ono, Ken Shiozaki</i>
<p>The past decade has witnessed significant progress in topological materials
investigation. Symmetry-indicator theory and topological quantum chemistry
provide an efficient scheme to diagnose topological phases from only partial
information of wave functions without full knowledge of topological invariants,
which has resulted in a recent comprehensive materials search. However, not all
topological phases can be captured by this framework, and topological
invariants are needed for a more refined diagnosis of topological phases. In
this study, we present a systematic framework to construct topological
invariants for a large part of symmetry classes, which should be contrasted
with the existing invariants discovered through one-by-one approaches. Our
method is based on the recently developed Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence
in momentum space. As a demonstration, we construct topological invariants for
time-reversal symmetric spinful superconductors with conventional pairing
symmetries of all space groups, for which symmetry indicators are silent. We
also validate that the obtained quantities work as topological invariants by
computing them for randomly generated symmetric Hamiltonians. Remarkably, the
constructed topological invariants completely characterize $K$-groups in 159
space groups. Our topological invariants for normal conducting phases are
defined under some gauge conditions. To facilitate efficient numerical
simulations, we discuss how to derive gauge-independent topological invariants
from the gauge-fixed topological invariants through some examples. Combined
with first-principles calculations, our results will help us discover
topological materials that could be used in next-generation devices and pave
the way for a more comprehensive topological materials database.

<p>Topological magnetic skyrmions in centrosymmetric systems exhibit a higher
degrees of freedom in their helicity, hence possess a great potential in the
advanced spintronics including skyrmion based quantum computation. However, the
centrosymmetric magnets also display non-topological trivial bubbles along with
the topological skyrmions. Hence it is utmost priority to investigate the
impact of different magnetic ground states and their underlying interactions on
the stabilization of magnetic skyrmions in cetrosymmetric magnets. Here, we
present a combined theoretical and experimental study on the role of
non-collinear magnetic ground state on the skyrmion stabilization in a series
of exchange frustrated non-collinear ferromagnetic system MnFe1-xCoxGe. With
the help of neutron diffraction (ND) and Lorentz transmission electron
microscopy (LTEM) studies, we show that hexagonal skyrmions lattice emerges as
a stable field driven state only when the underlying magnetic ground state is
collinear with easy-axis anisotropy. In contrast, non-topological type-II
bubbles are found to be stable state in the case of non-collinear magnetic
ordering with partial in-plane anisotropy. Furthermore, we also find that the
skyrmions transform to the non-topological bubbles when the system undergoes a
spin reorientation transition from the easy-axis to easy-cone ferromagnetic
phase. Our results categorically establish the significant role of in-plane
magnetic moment/anisotropy that hinders the stability of skyrmion both in the
case of collinear and non-collinear magnets. Thus, the present study offers a
wide range of opportunities to manipulate the stability of dipolar skyrmions by
changing the intrinsic characteristics of the materials.

<p>The interplay among topology, charge-density wave (CDW), and magnetism can
give rise to a plethora of exotic quantum phenomena. Recently, a group of
magnetic topological semimetals with tetragonal lattices and CDW order were
found to exhibit anomalous magnetic instability, helical spin ordering, and the
presence of skyrmions. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for these
observations remains unclear. Here, we conducted a comprehensive investigation
into the impact of CDW on the topological and magnetic properties of EuAl$_4$
using optical spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations. Through
optical spectroscopy, we observed a partial gap (60~meV) on the Fermi surface
and an enhanced mid-infrared absorption around 0.4~eV after the CDW transition.
Magneto-optical spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations proved that,
by affecting the band structure, the CDW order frustrates the antiferromagnetic
interactions but strengthened the ferromagnetic ones, which can destabilize the
magnetism. With lower symmetry in the CDW ordered state, carriers from the Weyl
bands will mediate the anisotropic magnetic interactions promoting the
formation of chiral spin textures. Conversely, without the CDW order, the
counterpart EuGa$_4$ shows robust collinear antiferromagnetic order. Our
findings uncover the pivotal role played by CDW order in arousing intricate
magnetism in topological materials and provide valuable insights into
controlling topological and magnetic properties through the manipulation of CDW
orders.

<p>In this work, we synthesized single crystal of EuCd$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits
A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order with in-plane spin orientation below $T_N$

insulator (TI) nature with an insulating gap around 0.1eV. Remarkably, a dual
topological Hall resistivity that exhibits same magnitude but opposite signs in
the positive to negative and negative to positive magnetic field hysteresis
branches emerges below 20~K. With magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and
numerical simulations, we attribute the dual topological Hall effect to the
N\'{e}el-type skyrmions stabilized by the interactions between topological
surface states and magnetism, and the sign reversal in different hysteresis
branches indicates potential coexistence of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Our
work uncovers a unique two-dimensional (2D) magnetism on the surface of
intrinsic AFM TI, providing a promising platform for novel topological quantum

<p>Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and state-of-the-art
many-body perturbation theory, we investigate the electronic and optical
properties of the inverse spinel CoFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$, a common anode material for
photocatalytic water splitting. Starting with different exchange-correlation
functionals, at the independent particle level we obtain a direct band gap of
1.38~eV (PBE+$U$) and 1.69 eV (SCAN+$U$), whereas HSE06 renders an indirect
band gap of 2.02~eV. Including quasiparticle effects within $G_{0}W_{0}$, a
larger and indirect band gap is obtained for all functionals: 1.78~eV
(PBE+$U$), 1.95~eV (SCAN+$U$) and 2.17~eV (HSE06), higher than the independent
particle (IP) band gap. Excitonic effects, taken into account by solving the
Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) lead to a redshift of the optical band gap to
1.50 (SCAN+$U$) and 1.61~eV (HSE06), in good agreement with the reported
experimental values. The lowest optical transitions in the visible range,
identified by means of oscillator strength, are at 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0~eV,
consistent with experimental observations. We also explored the effect of the
degree of inversion: the band gap is found to decrease from 1.69 ($x=1$) to
1.45 ($x=0.5$), and 1.19~eV ($x=0)$ within the IP approximation with SCAN+$U$.
This trend is reversed after the inclusion of excitonic effects, resulting in a
band gap of 1.50, 1.57, and 1.64~eV for $x$ = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.0, respectively.
The oscillator strength analysis of the BSE calculations indicates that both
$x$ = 0.0 and $x$ = 0.5 exhibit transitions below 1~eV with extremely small
oscillator strengths that are absent in the inverse spinel. This corroborates
previous suggestions that these transitions are due to the presence of
Co$^{2+}$ cations at the tetrahedral sites.

<h3>Case study of the validity of truncation schemes of kinetic equations of  motion: few magnetic impurities in a semiconductor quantum ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15872" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15872</a>
<br>
<i>J. M. Lia, P. I. Tamborenea</i>
<p>We carry out a study on the validity and limitations of truncation schemes
customarily employed to treat the quantum kinetic equations of motion of
complex interacting systems. Our system of choice is a semiconductor quantum
ring with one electron interacting with few magnetic impurities via a
Kondo-like Hamiltonian. This system is an interesting prototype which displays
the necessary complexity when suitably scaled (large number of magnetic
impurities) but can also be solved exactly when few impurities are present. The
complexity in this system comes from the indirect electron-mediated
impurity-impurity interaction and is reflected in the Heisenberg equations of
motion, which form an infinite hierarchy. For the cases of two and three
magnetic impurities, we solve for the quantum dynamics of our system both
exactly and following a truncation scheme developed for diluted magnetic
semiconductors in the bulk. We find an excellent agreement between the two
approaches when physical observables like the impurities' spin angular momentum
are computed for times that well exceed the time window of validity of
perturbation theory. On the other hand, we find that within time ranges of
physical interest, the truncation scheme introduces negative populations which
represents a serious methodological drawback.

<h3>Relation of the thermodynamic parameter of disordering with the width of  structure factor and defect concentration in a metallic glass</h3>

<p>In this work, we show that above the glass transition there exists a strong
unique interrelationship between the thermodynamic parameter of disorder of a
metallic glass derived using its excess entropy, diffraction measure of
disorder given by the width of the X-ray structure factor and defect
concentration derived from shear modulus measurements. Below the glass
transition, this relationship is more complicated and depends on both
temperature and thermal prehistory.

<h3>What are the emergent fermions and gauge fields in magnetized kagome  spin liquid?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15911" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15911</a>
<br>
<i>Gang V. Chen</i>
<p>Inspired by the recent quantum oscillation measurement on the kagom\'{e}
lattice antiferromagnet in finite magnetic fields, we raise the question about
the physical contents of the emergent fermions and the gauge fields if the U(1)
spin liquid is relevant for the finite-field kagom\'{e} lattice
antiferromagnet. Clearly, the magnetic field is non-perturbative in this
regime, and the finite-field state has no direct relation with the U(1) Dirac
spin liquid proposal at zero field. Based on the dual vortex theory, we here
propose that, the $S^z$ magnetization is the emergent U(1) gauge flux, and the
fermionized dual vortex is the emergent fermion. In this formalism, the
magnetic field polarizes the spin component along the field direction that
modulates the U(1) flux for the fermionized vortices and generates the quantum
oscillation. Within the mean-field theory, we further discuss gauge field
correlation, vortex-antivortex continuum and thermal Hall effect. We expect
this work to provide a bit insight for the magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquids.

<h3>High-fidelity spin qubit shuttling via large spin-orbit interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15970</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Bosco, Ji Zou, Daniel Loss</i>
<p>Shuttling spins with high fidelity is a key requirement to scale up
semiconducting quantum computers, enabling qubit entanglement over large
distances and favoring the integration of control electronics on-chip. To
decouple the spin from the unavoidable charge noise, state-of-the-art spin
shuttlers try to minimize the inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field. However, this
decoupling is challenging in otherwise promising quantum computing platforms
such as hole spin qubits in silicon and germanium, characterized by a large
spin-orbit interaction and electrically-tunable qubit frequency. In this work,
we show that, surprisingly, the large inhomogeneity of the Zeeman field
stabilizes the coherence of a moving spin state, thus enabling high-fidelity
shuttling also in these systems. We relate this enhancement in fidelity to the
deterministic dynamics of the spin which filters out the dominant low-frequency
contributions of the charge noise. By simulating several different scenarios
and noise sources, we show that this is a robust phenomenon generally occurring
at large field inhomogeneity. By appropriately adjusting the motion of the
quantum dot, we also design realistic protocols enabling faster and more
coherent spin shuttling. Our findings are generally applicable to a wide range
of setups and could pave the way toward large-scale quantum processors.

<h3>Optically Induced Monopoles, Knots, and Skyrmions in Quantum Gases</h3>

<br>
<i>Toni Annala, Tommi Mikkonen, Mikko Möttönen</i>
<p>We propose, and theoretically analyze, a practical protocol for the creation
of topological monopole configurations, quantum knots, and skyrmions in
Bose--Einstein condensates by employing fictitious magnetic fields induced by
the interaction of the atomic cloud with coherent light fields. It is observed
that a single coherent field is not enough for this purpose, but instead we
find incoherent superpositions of several coherent fields that introduce
topological point charges. We numerically estimate the experimentally
achievable strengths and gradients of the induced fictitious magnetic fields
and find them to be adjustable at will to several orders of magnitude greater
than those of the physical magnetic fields employed in previous experimental
studies. This property together with ultrafast control of the optical fields
paves the way for advanced engineering of topological defects in quantum gases.

<h3>Wannier charge center, spin resolved bulk polarization and corner modes  in a strained quantum spin Hall insulator</h3>

<i>Srijata Lahiri, Saurabh Basu</i>
<p>Topological invariants are a significant ingredient in the study of
topological phases of matter that intertwines the supposedly contradicting
concepts of bulk and boundary. The nature of the invariants differ depending on
the dimension of the boundary at which the topological states manifest
themselves. The primary motivation of this work is to study two distinct
scenarios of topological phase, differing in the dimensionality of their
boundary states and study the associated bulk topological invariants that
characterize them. In this regard, we study the band engineered Kane Mele model
which originally is a prototypical example of a system that hosts quantum spin
Hall effect on a honeycomb lattice. Under a smooth band deformation caused by
varying one of the nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes (say $t_1$) as compared
to the other two (say $t$), we observe that the system transits from its first
order topological insulating state (or quantum spin Hall state) to a second
order topological insulating (SOTI) state via a gap closing transition. This
transition occurs when the system crosses a particular threshold of the
deformation parameter $t_1\mathbin{/}t$ (namely $t_1\mathbin{/}t=2$). We show
the presence of edge and corner modes as a signature of first and second order
topology respectively. Further, we observe the evolution of the Wannier charge
center (WCC), a bulk property as a function of the deformation parameter
${t_1}\mathbin{/}{t}$. We also find that, while the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant
successfully characterizes the QSH state, it cannot characterize higher order
topology (second order here). The model being mirror invariant, we also
calculate mirror winding number to show that it is rendered trivial in the SOTI
phase as well, while being non-trivial in the QSH phase. Finally, spin resolved
bulk polarization establishes the SOTI phase as obstructed atomic insulator.

<h3>Acceleration of Solvation Free Energy Calculation via Thermodynamic  Integration Coupled with Gaussian Process Regression and Improved  Gelman-Rubin Convergence Diagnostics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16012</a>

<i>Zhou Yu, Enrique R. Batista, Ping Yang, Danny Perez</i>
<p>The determination of the solvation free energy of ions and molecules holds
profound importance across a spectrum of applications spanning chemistry,
biology, energy storage, and the environment. Molecular dynamics simulations
are a powerful tool for computing this critical parameter. Nevertheless, the
accurate and efficient calculation of solvation free energy becomes a
formidable endeavor when dealing with complex systems characterized by potent
Coulombic interactions and sluggish ion dynamics and, consequently, slow
transition across various metastable states. In the present study, we expose
limitations stemming from the conventional calculation of the statistical
inefficiency g in the thermodynamic integration method, a factor that can
hinder the determination of convergence of the solvation free energy and its
associated uncertainty. Instead, we propose a robust scheme based on
Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostics. We leverage this improved estimation of
uncertainties to introduce an innovative accelerated thermodynamic integration
method based on Gaussian Process regression. This methodology is applied to the
calculation of the solvation free energy of trivalent rare earth elements
immersed in ionic liquids, a scenario where the aforementioned challenges
render standard approaches ineffective. The proposed method proves effective in
computing solvation free energy in situations where traditional thermodynamic
integration methods fall short.

<h3>Lévy flights and Lévy walks under stochastic resetting</h3>

<p>Stochastic resetting is a protocol of starting anew, which can be used to
facilitate the escape kinetics. We demonstrate that restarting can accelerate
the escape kinetics from a finite interval restricted by two absorbing
boundaries also in the presence of heavy-tailed, L\'evy type, $\alpha$-stable
noise. However, the width of the domain where resetting is beneficial depends
on the value of the stability index $\alpha$ determining power-law decay of
jump length distribution. For heavier (smaller $\alpha$) distributions the
domain becomes narrower in comparison to lighter tails. Additionally, we
explore connections between L\'evy flights and L\'evy walks in presence of
stochastic resetting. First of all, we show that for L\'evy walks, the
stochastic resetting can be beneficial also in the domain where coefficient of
variation is smaller than 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the domain where
LW are characterized by a finite mean jump duration/length, with the increasing
width of the interval LW start to share similarities with LF under stochastic
resetting.

<h3>Paramagnetic contribution in superconductors with different-mass Cooper  pairs</h3>

<i>Pengfei Li, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu</i>
<p>Cooper pairs formed by two electrons with different effective mass are common
in multiband superconductors, pair density wave states and other
superconducting systems with multi-degrees of freedom. In this work, we show
that there are paramagnetic contributions to the superfluid stiffness in
superconductors with different-mass Cooper pairs. This paramagnetic response is
owing to the relative motion between two electrons with different mass. We
investigate the paramagnetic contributions based on the linear response theory
in two-band superconductors with interband pairings and in pair density wave
states respectively. Our results offer a new perspective to the electromagnetic
superfluid stiffness in unconventional superconductors.

<h3>Is the Anti-Pfaffian a PH-Pfaffian Topological Order State?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16039" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16039</a>
<br>
<i>Jian Yang</i>
<p>Recently we have shown that the anti-Pfaffian state and a state described by
the second Landau level (SLL) projection of antiholomorphic Pfaffian
wavefunctions have large overlap and almost identical low-energy orbital
entanglement structures, suggesting they have the same topological order. In
this paper, we further show that the similar entanglement structure observed in
the SLL projected state is also identifiable in other Landau level projected
states, indicating it is not the result of the SLL projection but rather a
"fingerprint" of the PH-Pfaffian topological order of the original unprojected
antiholomorphic Pfaffian wavefunctions. Consequently, we argue that the SLL
projected state, and therefore the anti-Pfaffian state, is a PH-Pfaffian
topological order state. We also discuss the implications on the edge physics.

<h3>Energy Dissipation of Fast Electrons in Polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA):  Towards a Universal Curve for Electron Beam Attenuation in Solids for  Energies between ~0 eV and 100 keV</h3>

Johannes Kero, Alessandra Bellissimo and Olga Ridzel
Spectroscopy of correlated electron pairs was employed to investigate the
energy dissipation process as well as the transport and the emission of low
energy electrons on a polymethylmetracylate (PMMA) surface, providing secondary
electron (SE) spectra causally related to the energy loss of the primary
electron. Two groups of electrons are identified in the cascade of slow
electrons, corresponding to different stages in the energy dissipation process.
For both groups, the characteristic lengths for attenuation due to collective
excitations and momentum relaxation are quantified and are found to be
distinctly different: l1=(12.0+/-2) Angstroem and l2=(61.5+/-11) Angstroem. The
results strongly contradict the commonly employed model of exponential
attenuation with the electron inelastic mean free path (IMFP) as characteristic
length, but essentially agree with a theory used for decades in astrophysics
and neutron transport, albeit with characteristic lengths expressed in units of
Angstroems rather than lightyears.

<h3>An analysis of localization transitions using non-parametric  unsupervised learning</h3>

<i>Carlo Vanoni, Vittorio Vitale</i>
<p>Localization transitions induced by disorder in quantum systems have been
subject of intense discussion in the past decades. In particular, whether or
not a localized phase is stable to the presence of interactions in the
thermodynamic limit, is still an open question which is difficult to tackle
both with numerical and analytical approaches. Here, we provide an alternative
viewpoint by analyzing the classical encoding configurations of the disordered
quantum system state and showing that its critical properties can be seen also
as a geometric transition in data space. We showcase our approach on the
Anderson model on regular random graphs, estimating the transition point in
agreement with results in the literature. We provide a simple and coherent
explanation of our findings, discussing the applicability of the method in
real-world scenarios with a modest number of measurements.

<h3>Effects of salinity on flows of dense colloidal suspensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16055" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16055</a>
<br>
<i>Marc Lagoin, Rémy Fulcrand, Agnès Piednoir, Antoine Bérut</i>
<p>We experimentally study the effects of salt concentration on the flowing
dynamics of dense suspensions of micrometer-sized silica particles in
microfluidic drums. In pure water, the particles are fully sedimented under
their own weight, but do not touch each others due to their negative surface
charges, which results in a "frictionless" dense colloidal suspension. When the
pile is inclined above a critical angle $\theta_c \sim 5{\deg}$ a fast
avalanche occurs, similar to what is expected for classical athermal granular
media. When inclined below this angle, the pile slowly creeps until it reaches
flatness. Adding ions in solution screens the repulsive forces between
particles, and the flowing properties of the suspension are modified. We
observe significant changes in the fast avalanche regime: a time delay appears
before the onset of the avalanche and increases with the salt concentration,
the whole dynamics becomes slower, and the critical angle $\theta_c$ increases
from $\sim 5{\deg}$ to $\sim 20{\deg}$. In contrast, the slow creep regime does
not seem to be heavily modified. These behaviors can be explained by
considering an increase in both the initial packing fraction of the suspension
$\Phi_0$, and the effective friction between the particles $\mu_p$. These
observations are confirmed by confocal microscopy measurements to estimate the
initial packing fraction of the suspensions, and AFM measurements to quantify
the particles surface roughness and the repulsion forces, as a function of the
ionic strength of the suspensions.

<p>Defining microstructures and managing local crystallinity allow the
implementation of several functionalities in thin film technology. The use of
ultrashort Bessel beams for bulk crystallinity modification has garnered
considerable attention as a versatile technique for semiconductor materials,
dielectrics, or metal oxide substrates. The aim of this work is the
quantitative evaluation of the crystalline changes induced by ultrafast laser
micromachining on manganese oxide thin films using micro-Raman spectroscopy.
Pulsed Bessel beams featured by a 1 micrometer-sized central core are used to
define structures with high spatial precision. The dispersion relation of Mn3O4
optical phonons is determined by considering the conjunction between X-ray
diffraction characterization and the phonon localization model. The asymmetries
in Raman spectra indicate phonon localization and enable a quantitative tool to
determine the crystallite size at micrometer resolution. The results indicate
that laser-writing is effective in modifying the low-crystallinity films
locally, increasing crystallite sizes from ~8 nm up to 12 nm, and thus
highlighting an interesting approach to evaluate laser-induced structural
modifications on metal oxide thin films.

<i>Luigi Camerano, Gianni Profeta</i>
<p>In the light of new experimental evidence we study the insulating ground
state of the $3d^2$-transition metal trihalides VX$_3$ (X=Cl, I). Based on
Density Functional Theory with the Hubbard correction (DFT$+U$) we
systematically show how these systems host multiple metastable states
characterized by different orbital ordering and electronic behaviour. Our
calculations reveal the importance of imposing a precondition in the on site
$d$ density matrix and of considering a symmetry broken unit cell to correctly
take into account the correlation effects in a mean field framework.
Furthermore we ultimately found a ground state with the $a_{1g}$ orbital
occupied in a distorted VX$_6$ octahedra driven by an optical phonon mode.

<h3>Three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$ topological insulators without reflection  symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander C. Tyner, Vladimir Juričić</i>
<p>In recent decades, the Altland-Zirnabuer (AZ) table has proven incredibly
powerful in delineating constraints for topological classification of a given
band-insulator based on dimension and (nonspatial) symmetry class, and has also
been expanded by considering additional crystalline symmetries. Nevertheless,
realizing a three-dimensional (3D), time-reversal symmetric (class AII)
topological insulator (TI) in the absence of reflection symmetries, with a
classification beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ paradigm remains an open problem. In
this work we present a general procedure for constructing such systems within
the framework of projected topological branes (PTBs). In particular, a 3D
projected brane from a ``parent" four-dimensional topological insulator
exhibits a $\mathbb{Z}$ topological classification, corroborated through its
response to the inserted bulk monopole loop. More generally, PTBs have been
demonstrated to be an effective route to performing dimensional reduction and
embedding the topology of a $(d+1)$-dimensional ``parent" Hamiltonian in $d$
dimensions, yielding lower-dimensional topological phases beyond the AZ
classification without additional symmetries. Our findings should be relevant
for the metamaterial platforms, such as photonic and phonic crystals,
topolectric circuits, and designer systems.
