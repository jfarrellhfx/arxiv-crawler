<h3>Loop ensembles in Stochastic Series Expansion of Two-Dimensional  Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09366" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09366</a>

The Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) method along with resummation over the
spin or flavor values maps the partition function of a quantum antiferromagnet
to a closely-packed loop gas model in one higher dimension. Earlier work by
Nahum et al. has shown that certain closely-packed three-dimensional loop gas
models exhibit phases dominated by macroscopic loops, wherein the corresponding
joint distribution of loop lengths is Poisson-Dirichlet. On grounds of
universality, the same is expected of the ensemble of loops obtained in
(2+1)-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, albeit the loops emerge from a
different microscopic origin. We sample the SSE loop ensemble for SU(N)
antiferromagnets on a square lattice using Monte Carlo and study how the joint
distribution varies with the degree of representation N and inverse temperature
$\beta$. We observe that, for low temperatures and small N($\leq$ 4), the
distribution indeed shows characteristics of Poisson-Dirichlet behaviour when
antiferromagnetic correlations dominate the system.

<h3>Optical properties of ScN layers grown on Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001) by  plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</h3>

<br>
<br>
An accurate knowledge of the optical constants (refractive index $n$ and
extinction coefficient $k$) of ScN is crucial for understanding the optical
properties of this binary nitride semiconductor as well as for its use in
optoelectronic applications. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry in a spectral
range from far infrared to far ultraviolet (0.045-8.5 eV), we determine $n$ and
$k$ of ScN layers grown on Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001) substrates by plasma-assisted
molecular beam epitaxy. Fits of ellipsometry data return the energies of four
oscillators representing critical points in the band structure of ScN, namely,
2.03, 3.89, 5.33, and 6.95 eV. As the infrared range is dominated by free
carriers, the vibrational properties of the layers are examined by Raman
spectroscopy. Despite the rocksalt structure of ScN, several first-order phonon
modes are observed, suggesting a high density of point defects consistent with
the high electron density deduced from Hall measurements. Finally,
photoluminescence measurements reveal an emission band slightly above the
lowest direct bandgap. We attribute the redshift of the peak emission energy
from 2.3 to 2.2 eV with increasing layer thickness to a reduction of the O
concentration in the layers.

<h3>Numerical signatures of ultra-local criticality in a one dimensional  Kondo lattice model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09402</a>

Heavy fermion criticality has been a long-standing problem in condensed
matter physics. Here we study a one-dimensional Kondo lattice model through
numerical simulation and observe signatures of local criticality. We vary the
Kondo coupling $J_K$ at fixed doping $x$. At large positive $J_K$, we confirm
the expected conventional Luttinger liquid phase with $2k_F=\frac{1+x}{2}$ (in
units of $2\pi$), an analogue of the heavy Fermi liquid (HFL) in the higher
dimension. In the $J_K \leq 0$ side, our simulation finds the existence of a
fractional Luttinger liquid (LL*) phase with $2k_F=\frac{x}{2}$, accompanied by
a gapless spin mode originating from localized spin moments, which serves as an
analogue of the fractional Fermi liquid (FL*) phase in higher dimensions. The
LL* phase becomes unstable and transitions to a spin-gapped Luther-Emery (LE)
liquid phase at small positive $J_K$. Then we mainly focus on the `critical
regime' between the LE phase and the LL phase. Approaching the critical point
from the spin-gapped LE phase, we often find that the spin gap vanishes
continuously, while the spin-spin correlation length in real space stays finite
and small. For a certain range of doping, in a point (or narrow region) of
$J_K$, the dynamical spin structure factor obtained through the time-evolving
block decimation (TEBD) simulation shows dispersion-less spin fluctuations in a
finite range of momentum space above a small energy scale (around $0.035 J$)
that is limited by the TEBD accuracy. All of these results are unexpected for a
regular gapless phase (or critical point) described by conformal field theory
(CFT). Instead, they are more consistent with exotic ultra-local criticality
with an infinite dynamical exponent $z=+\infty$. Lastly, we propose to simulate
the model in a bilayer optical lattice with a potential difference.

<h3>Wegner's Ising gauge spins versus Kitaev's Majorana partons: Mapping and  application to anisotropic confinement in spin-orbital liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09405" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09405</a>
<br>
<i>Urban F. P. Seifert, Sergej Moroz</i>
<br>
<br>
Emergent gauge theories take a prominent role in the description of quantum
matter, supporting deconfined phases with topological order and fractionalized
excitations. A common construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories,
first introduced by Wegner, involves Ising gauge spins placed on links and
subject to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauss law constraint. As shown by Kitaev,
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories also emerge in the exact solution of
certain spin systems with bond-dependent interactions. In this context, the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is constructed from Majorana fermions, with gauge
constraints given by the parity of Majorana fermions on each site. In this
work, we provide an explicit Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps between
these two formulations on the square lattice, where the Kitaev-type gauge
theory emerges as the exact solution of a spin-orbital (Kugel-Khomskii)
Hamiltonian. We then apply our mapping to study local perturbations to the
spin-orbital Hamiltonian, which correspond to anisotropic interactions between
electric-field variables in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. These are shown to
induce anisotropic confinement that is characterized by emergence of
weakly-coupled one-dimensional spin chains. We study the nature of these phases
and corresponding confinement transitions in both absence and presence of
itinerant fermionic matter degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss how our
mapping can be applied to the Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice.

<h3>Altermagnetic Routes to Majorana Modes in Zero Net Magnetization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09413</a>
<br>
<i>Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Taylor L. Hughes, Jennifer Cano</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose heterostructures that realize first and second order topological
superconductivity with vanishing net magnetization by utilizing altermagnetism.
Such platforms may offer a significant improvement over conventional platforms
with uniform magnetization since the latter suppresses the superconducting gap.
We first introduce a 1D semiconductor-superconductor structure in proximity to
an altermagnet which realizes end Majorana zero modes (MZMs) with vanishing net
magnetization. Additionally, a coexisting Zeeman term provides a tuning knob to
distinguish topological and trivial zero modes. We then propose 2D
altermagnetic platforms that can realize chiral Majorana fermions or higher
order corner MZMs. Our work paves the way towards realizing Majorana boundary
states with an alternative source of time-reversal breaking and zero net
magnetization.

<h3>Quantum Oscillations of the Quasiparticle Lifetime in a Metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09420" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09420</a>
<br>
<i>Nico Huber, Valentin Leeb, Andreas Bauer, Georg Benka, Johannes Knolle, Christian Pfleiderer, Marc A. Wilde</i>
<br>
<br>
Following nearly a century of research, it remains a puzzle that the
low-lying excitations of metals are remarkably well explained by effective
single-particle theories of non-interacting bands. The abundance of
interactions in real materials raises the question of direct spectroscopic
signatures of phenomena beyond effective single-particle, single-band
behaviour. Here we report the identification of quantum oscillations (QOs) in
the three-dimensional topological semimetal CoSi, which defy the standard
description in two fundamental aspects. First, the oscillation frequency
corresponds to the difference of semi-classical quasi-particle (QP) orbits of
two bands, which are forbidden as half of the trajectory would oppose the
Lorentz force. Second, the oscillations exist up to above 50K - in stark
contrast to all other oscillatory components - which vanish below a few K. Our
findings are in excellent agreement with generic model calculations of QOs of
the QP lifetime. Since the only precondition for their existence is a
non-linear coupling of at least two electronic orbits, e.g., due to QP
scattering on defects or collective excitations, such QOs of the QP lifetime
are generic for any metal featuring Landau quantization with multiple orbits.
They are consistent with certain frequencies in topological semi-metals,
unconventional superconductors, rare-earth compounds, and Rashba-systems, and
permit to identify and gauge correlation phenomena, e.g., in two-dimensional
materials and multiband metals.

<h3>Visualizing the melting of the charge density wave in UTe2 by generation  of pairs of topological defects with opposite winding</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09423</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Topological defects are singularities in an ordered phase that can have a
profound effect on phase transitions and serve as a window into the order
parameter. In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the
role of topological defects in the novel magnetic field induced disappearance
of an intertwined charge density wave (CDW) in the heavy fermion
superconductor, UTe2. By simultaneously imaging the amplitude and phase of the
CDW order, we reveal pairs of topological defects with positive and negative
phase winding. The pairs are directly correlated with a zero CDW amplitude and
increase in number with increasing magnetic field. These observations can be
captured by a Ginzburg Landau model of a uniform superconductor coexisting with
a pair density wave. A magnetic field generates vortices of the superconducting
and pair density wave order which can create topological defects in the CDW and
induce the experimentally observed melting of the CDW at the upper critical
field. Our work reveals the important role of magnetic field generated
topological defects in the melting the CDW order parameter in UTe2 and provides
support for the existence of a parent pair density wave order on the surface of
UTe2.

<h3>Time-dependent driving and topological protection in the fractional  Josephson effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09440" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09440</a>
<br>
<i>Ahmed Kenawy, Fabian Hassler, Roman-Pascal Riwar</i>
<br>
<br>
The control of any type of quantum hardware invariably necessitates
time-dependent driving. If the basis depends on the control parameter, the
presence of a time-dependent control field yields an extra term in the
Schr\"odinger equation that is often neglected. Here, we examine the effect of
this term in a flux-controlled Majorana junction. We show that a time-varying
flux gives rise to an electromotive force which is amplified when truncating to
the junction's low-energy degrees of freedom. As a result, it compromises the
robustness of the ground-state degeneracy present in the absence of the drive.
The resulting flattening of the energy spectrum can be measured by a strong
suppression of the dc supercurrent.

<h3>Active particle in a harmonic trap driven by a resetting noise: an  approach via Kesten variables</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09453" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09453</a>
<br>
<i>Mathis Gueneau, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider an active particle trapped in a harmonic potential, and subjected
to a resetting noise. At some random times, the noise is reset to an arbitrary
position and restarts its motion. We focus on two resetting protocols: periodic
resetting, where the period is deterministic, and Poissonian resetting, where
times between resets are exponentially distributed with a rate $r$. Between the
different resetting epochs, we can express recursively the position of the
particle. The random relation obtained takes a simple Kesten form that can be
used to derive an integral equation for the stationary distribution of the
position. We provide a detailed analysis of the distribution when the noise is
a resetting Brownian motion. In this particular instance, we also derive a
renewal equation for the full time dependent distribution of the position that
we extensively study. These methods are quite general and can be used to study
any process harmonically trapped when the noise is reset at random times.

<h3>Generalized surface multifractality in 2D disordered systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09455" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09455</a>
<br>
<i>Serafim S. Babkin, Jonas F. Karcher, Igor S. Burmistrov, Alexander D. Mirlin</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, a concept of generalized multifractality, which characterizes
fluctuations and correlations of critical eigenstates, was introduced and
explored for all ten symmetry classes of disordered systems. Here, by using the
non-linear sigma-model field theory, we extend the theory of generalized
multifractality to boundaries of systems at criticality. Our numerical
simulations on two-dimensional (2D) systems of symmetry classes A, C, and AII
fully confirm the analytical predictions of pure-scaling observables and Weyl
symmetry relations between critical exponents of surface generalized
multifractality. This demonstrates validity of the non-linear sigma-model field
theory for description of Anderson-localization critical phenomena not only in
the bulk but also on the boundary. The critical exponents strongly violate
generalized parabolicity, in analogy with earlier results for the bulk,
corroborating the conclusion that the considered Anderson-localization critical
points are not described by conformal field theories. We further derive
relations between generalized surface multifractal spectra and linear
combinations of Lyapunov exponents of a strip in quasi-one-dimensional
geometry, which hold under assumption of invariance with respect to a
logarithmic conformal map. Our numerics demonstrate that these relations hold
with an excellent accuracy. Taken together, our results indicate an intriguing
situation: the conformal invariance is broken but holds partially at critical
points of Anderson localization.

<h3>Resistivity tensor of vortex-lattice states in Josephson junction arrays</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander-Georg Penner, Karsten Flensberg, Leonid I. Glazman, Felix von Oppen</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional Josephson junction arrays frustrated by a perpendicular
magnetic field are predicted to form a cascade of distinct vortex lattice
states. Here, we show that the resistivity tensor provides both structural and
dynamical information on the vortex-lattice states and intervening phase
transitions, which allows for experimental identification of these
symmetry-breaking ground states. We illustrate our general approach by a
microscopic theory of the resistivity tensor for a range of magnetic fields
exhibiting a rich set of vortex lattices as well as transitions to
liquid-crystalline vortex states.

<h3>Experimental test of Landauer's principle for stochastic resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09503" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09503</a>
<br>
<i>Rémi Goerlich, Minghao Li, Luís Barbosa Pires, Paul-Antoine Hervieux, Giovanni Manfredi, Cyriaque Genet</i>
<br>
<br>
A diffusive process that is reset to its origin at random times, so-called
stochastic resetting (SR) is an ubiquitous expedient in many natural systems
\cite{Evans2011}. Beyond its ability to improve efficiency of target searching,
SR is a true non-equilibrium thermodynamic process that brings forward new and
challenging questions \cite{Fuchs2016}. Here, we experimentally implement SR
within a time-dependent optical trapping potential and give a quantitative
assessment of its thermodynamics. We show in particular that SR operates as a
Maxwell demon, converting heat into work from a single bath continuously and
without feedback \cite{Roldan2014, Ciliberto2019}. Such a demon is the
manifestation of the constant erasure of information at play in resetting that,
in our experiments, takes the form of a protocol. By tailoring this protocol,
we can bring the demon down to its minimal energetic cost, the Landauer bound
\cite{Lutz2015}. In addition, we reveal that the individual trajectories
forming this autonomous demon all break ergodicity and thereby demonstrate the
non-ergodic nature of the demon's \textit{modus operandi}.

<h3>Coalescence of limit cycles in the presence of noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09524" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09524</a>
<br>
<i>Sergei Shmakov, Peter B. Littlewood</i>
<br>
<br>
Complex dynamical systems may exhibit multiple steady states, including
time-periodic limit cycles, where the final trajectory depends on initial
conditions. With tuning of parameters, limit cycles can proliferate or merge at
an exceptional point. Here we ask how dynamics in the vicinity of such a
bifurcation are influenced by noise. A pitchfork bifurcation can be used to
induce bifurcation behavior. We model a limit cycle with the normal form of the
Hopf oscillator, couple it to the pitchfork, and investigate the resulting
dynamical system in the presence of noise. We show that the generating
functional for the averages of the dynamical variables factorizes between the
pitchfork and the oscillator. The statistical properties of the pitchfork in
the presence of noise in its various regimes are investigated and a scaling
theory is developed for the correlation and response functions. The analysis is
done by perturbative calculations as well as numerical means. Finally,
observables illustrating the coupling of a system with a limit cycle to a
pitchfork are discussed and the phase-phase correlations are shown to exhibit
non-diffusive behavior with universal scaling.

<h3>On data and dimension in chemistry I -- irreversibility, concealment and  emergent conservation laws</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09553</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Blokhuis, Martijn van Kuppeveld, Daan van de Weem, Robert Pollice</i>
<br>
<br>
Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the
reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In
spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues
to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws
relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been
limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension
of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions, i.e. the number of
measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to
relate the experimentally observed dimension to the structure of the CRN. In
particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and
reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have
proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be
captured by the \emph{co-production law} $\Upsilon = \ell_\bullet +
\wedge_\bullet$ relating co-production relations $\Upsilon$ to emergent
non-integer conservation laws $\ell_\bullet$ and broken cycles
$\wedge_\bullet$. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a
machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law. We also obtain
laws that allow us to deduce network structure in cases where some species
cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique. This
enables us to relate portions of spectral data to portions of CRN structure,
for instance isosbestic points relate to local conservation laws. We anticipate
that the reconstruction of CRN structure will thereby simplify and increasingly
resemble the type of logical puzzles encountered in molecular structure
determination via spectroscopy.

<h3>Nature of the 1/9-magnetization plateau in the spin-1/2 kagome  Heisenberg antiferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09563" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09563</a>
<br>
<i>Da-zhi Fang, Ning Xi, Shi-Ju Ran, Gang Su</i>
<br>
<br>
The nature of the 1/9-magnetization plateau of the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg
antiferromagnet remains controversial due to the exotic physical properties and
high complexity induced by the geometrical frustration. Instead of a Z3 quantum
spin liquid revealed on a cylinder, we show on an infinite-size lattice that
the 1/9 plateau can be described by a valence bond crystal (VBC) that breaks
spatial translational invariance. Consistent results are achieved by two
accurate tensor network methods, namely the full-update infinite
projected-entangled pair states and the projected-entangled simplex states. The
VBC exhibits an hourglass pattern with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spatial
symmetry, demonstrated by magnetizations, bond energies, and three-body
correlators. The spatial inversion symmetry in the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ VBC
is instantly broken with the presence of the difference between the coupling
strengths in the up and down triangles, suggesting the existence of gapless
excitations. The gapless nature of the 1/9 plateau is further indicated by the
scaling behaviors of the entanglement entropy and the correlation length, which
indicate a c=1 conformal field theory.

Spin textures such as magnetic domain walls and skyrmions have the potential
to revolutionize electronic devices by encoding information bits. Although
recent advancements in ferromagnetic films have led to promising device
prototypes, their widespread implementation has been hindered by the
material-related drawbacks. Antiferromagnetic spin textures, however, offer a
solution to many of these limitations, paving the way for faster, smaller, more
energy-efficient, and more robust electronics. The functionality of synthetic
antiferromagnets, comprised of two or more magnetic layers separated by
spacers, may be easily manipulated by making use of different materials as well
as interface engineering. In this Perspective article, we examine the
challenges and opportunities presented by spin textures in synthetic
antiferromagnets and propose possible directions and prospects for future
research in this burgeoning field.

Quantum geometry - the geometry of electron Bloch wavefunctions - is central
to modern condensed matter physics. Due to the quantum nature, quantum geometry
has two parts, the real part quantum metric and the imaginary part Berry
curvature. The studies of Berry curvature have led to countless breakthroughs,
ranging from the quantum Hall effect in 2DEGs to the anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) in ferromagnets. However, in contrast to Berry curvature, the quantum
metric has rarely been explored. Here, we report a new nonlinear Hall effect
induced by quantum metric by interfacing even-layered MnBi2Te4 (a PT-symmetric
antiferromagnet (AFM)) with black phosphorus. This novel nonlinear Hall effect
switches direction upon reversing the AFM spins and exhibits distinct scaling
that suggests a non-dissipative nature. Like the AHE brought Berry curvature
under the spotlight, our results open the door to discovering quantum metric
responses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the AFM can harvest wireless
electromagnetic energy via the new nonlinear Hall effect, therefore enabling
intriguing applications that bridges nonlinear electronics with AFM
spintronics.

<h3>Spin and orbital Hall currents detected via current induced  magneto-optical Kerr effect in V and Pt</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09585" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09585</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We have studied the film thickness dependence of current induced
magneto-optical Kerr effect in Pt and V thin films. The Kerr signal for Pt
shows little dependence on the thickness in the range studied (20-80 nm). In
contrast, the signal for V increases with increasing thickness and saturates at
a thickness near 100 nm to a value significantly larger than that of Pt. These
experimental results are accounted for assuming that spin and orbital Hall
effects are responsible for the Kerr signal. We show that the Kerr signal is
proportional to the product of the dc spin (orbital) Hall conductivity and the
energy derivative of the ac spin (orbital) Hall conductivity. Contributions
from the spin and orbital Hall effects add up for V whereas they cancel out for
Pt. The thickness dependence of the Kerr signal suggests that the orbital
diffusion length of V is considerably smaller compared to its spin diffusion
length.

<h3>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electronic density by surface-bulk  hybridization in topological insulators</h3>

We analyze the electronic density distribution in a topological insulator
slab of finite thickness, where the bulk and surface states are allowed to
hybridize. By using a continuous Hamiltonian approach as a theoretical
framework, we analytically computed the wave functions for each state near the
$\Gamma$-point. Our results reveal that, under particular combinations of the
hybridized bulk and surface states, the spatial symmetry of the electronic
density with respect to the center of the slab can be spontaneously broken.
This symmetry breaking arises as a combination of the parity of the solutions,
their spin projection, and the material constants

Antiferromagnets exhibiting giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous
Nernst effect (ANE) have recently aroused broad interest, not only for their
potential applications in future electronic devices, but also because of the
rich physics arising from the Berry curvature near the Fermi level.
$\rm{Co_{1/3}NbS_2}$, by intercalating $\rm{Co^{2+}}$ ions between $\rm{NbS_2}$
layers, is a quasi-two-dimensional layered antiferromagnet with a chiral
lattice. A large AHE has been observed in $\rm{Co_{1/3}NbS_2}$, but its origin
is under debate. In this letter, we report the large AHE and ANE in exfoliated
$\rm{Co_{1/3}NbS_2}$ flakes. By analyzing the thermoelectric data via the Mott
relation, we determined that the observed large AHE and ANE primarily result
from the intrinsic Berry curvature. We also observed the magnetic domains in
$\rm{Co_{1/3}NbS_2}$ by reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements.
Combined with electrical transport measurements, we confirmed that the magnetic
reversal in $\rm{Co_{1/3}NbS_2}$ is determined by domain wall motion, and the
critical field ($H_c$) exhibits a memory effect of consecutive magnetic sweeps.
Our work provides insight into the topological properties of
$\rm{Co_{1/3}NbS_2}$ and paves the way to studying the spin configuration and
magnetic domain dynamics in this fascinating antiferromagnet.

We theoretically investigate the nonlinear response current of a
two-dimensional system under an in-plane magnetic field. Based on the extended
semiclassical theory, we develop a unified theory including both longitudinal
and transverse currents and classify contributions according to their scaling
with the relaxation time. Besides time-reversal-even contributions, we reveal a
previously unknown time-reversal-odd contribution to the Hall current, which
occurs in magnetic systems, exhibits band geometric origin, and is linear in
relaxation time. We show that the different contributions exhibit different
symmetry characters, especially in their angular dependence on the field
orientation, which can be used to distinguish them in experiment. The theory is
explicitly demonstrated in the study of the Rashba model. Our work presents a
deepened understanding of nonlinear planar transport, proposes approaches to
distinguish different contributions, and sheds light on possible routes to
enhance the effect in practice.

The successful realization of the topological Weyl semimetals has
revolutionized contemporary physics. In recent years, multi-Weyl semimetals, a
class of topological Weyl semimetals, has attracted broad interest in
condensed-matter physics. Multi-Weyl semimetals are emerging topological
semimetals with nonlinear anisotropic energy dispersion, which is characterized
by higher topological charges. In this study, we investigate how the
topological charge affects the nonlinear optical response from multi-Weyl
semimetals. It has been observed that the laser-driven electronic current is
characteristic of the topological charge, and
the laser polarization's direction influences the current's direction and
amplitude. In addition, the anomalous current, perpendicular to the laser's
polarization, carries a distinct signature of the topological charges and
encodes the information about the parity and amplitude of the nontrivial Berry
curvature. We show that the anomalous current associated with the anomalous
Hall effect remains no longer proportional to the topological charge at higher
laser intensity -- a significant deviation from the linear response theory.
High-harmonic spectroscopy is employed to capture the distinct and interesting
features of the currents in multi-Weyl semimetals where the topological charge
drastically impacts the harmonics' yield and energy cutoff.

Graphene-based plasmonic devices are regarded to be suitable for a plethora
of applications, ranging from mid-infrared to terahertz frequencies. In this
regard, among the peculiarities associated with graphene, it is well known that
plasmons are tunable and tend to show stronger confinement as well as a longer
lifetime than in the noble-metal counterpart. However, due to the
two-dimensional specificity of graphene, the presence of defects might induce
stronger effects than in bulky noble metals. Here, we theoretically investigate
the impact of structural defects hosted by graphene on selected figures of
merit associated to localized plasmons, which are of key technological
importance for plasmon-based molecular sensing. By considering an optimized
graphene nanostructure, we provide a comparative analysis intended to shed
light on the impact of the type of defect on graphene localized plasmons, that
regards distinct types of defects commonly arising from fabrication procedures
or exposure to radiation. This understanding will help industry and academia in
better identifying the most suitable applications for graphene-based molecular
sensing.

<h3>Exploring charge and spin fluctuations in infinite-layer cuprate  SrCuO$_{2}$ from a phonon perspective</h3>

The infinite-layer cuprate $A$CuO$_2$ ($A=$ Ca, Sr, Ba) has the simplest
crystal structure among numerous cuprate superconductors and can serve a
prototypical system to explore the unconventional superconductivity. Based on
the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we have studied the
electronic and magnetic properties of the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_{2}$
from a phonon perspective. We find that interesting fluctuations of charges,
electrical dipoles, and local magnetic moments can be induced by the zero-point
vibrations of phonon modes in SrCuO$_{2}$ upon the hole doping. Among all
optical phonon modes of SrCuO$_{2}$ in the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el state,
only the $A_{1}$$_g$ mode that involves the full-breathing O vibrations along
the Cu-O bonds can cause significant fluctuations of local magnetic moments on
O atoms and dramatic charge redistributions between Cu and O atoms. Notably,
due to the zero-point vibration of the $A_{1g}$ mode, both the charge
fluctuations on Cu and the electrical dipoles on O show a dome-like evolution
with increasing hole doping, quite similar to the experimentally observed
behavior of the superconducting $T_c$; in comparison, the fluctuations of local
magnetic moments on O display a monotonic enhancement along with the hole
doping. Further analyses indicate that around the optimal doping, there exist a
large softening in the frequency of the $A_{1g}$ phonon mode and a van Hove
singularity in the electronic structure close to the Fermi level, suggesting
potential electron-phonon coupling. Our work reveals the important role of the
full-breathing O phonon mode playing in the infinite-layer SrCuO$_{2}$, which
may provide new insights in understanding the cuprate superconductivity.

The effects of cobalt incorporation in spherical heterostructured iron oxide
nanocrystals (NCs) of sub-critical size have been explored by colloidal
chemistry methods. Synchrotron X-ray total scattering methods suggest that
cobalt (Co) substitution in rock salt iron oxide NCs tends to remedy its vacant
iron sites, offering a higher degree of resistance to oxidative conversion.
Self-passivation still creates a spinel-like shell, but with higher volume
fraction of the rock salt Co-containing phase in the core. The higher divalent
metal stoichiometry in the rock salt phase, with increasing Co content, results
in a population of unoccupied tetrahedral metal sites in the spinel part,
likely through oxidative shell creation, involving an ordered defect-clustering
mechanism, directly correlated to the core stabilization. To shed light on the
effects of Co-substitution and atomic-scale defects (vacant sites), Monte Carlo
simulations suggest that designed NCs, with desirable, enhanced magnetic
properties (cf. exchange bias and coercivity), are developed with
magnetocrystalline anisotropy raised at relatively low content of Co ions in
the lattice. Growth of optimally performing candidates combines also a strongly
exchange-coupled system, secured through a high volumetric ratio rock salt
phase, interfaced by a not so defective spinel shell. In view of these
requirements, Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) calculations demonstrate that the
sufficiently protected from oxidation rock salt core and preserved over time
heterostructure, play a key role in magnetically-mediated heating efficacies,
for potential use of such NCs in magnetic hyperthermia applications.

Solid materials possess both long-range order and some degree of disorder are
critical for understanding the nature of crystal and glassy state, but how to
controllable introduce specific type of disorder into a crystalline material is
a big challenge. Our previous work indicated that weakening the inter-layer
interaction is an effective strategy to import disorders between the
layers.Here, we illustrated that the inter-layer interaction can be weakened to
around 1/60 of that of graphite in the self-assembled material, a

Dislocation-interface interactions dictate the mechanical properties of
polycrystalline materials through dislocation absorption, emission and
reflection and interface sliding. We derive a mesoscale interface boundary
condition to describe these, based on bicrystallography and Burgers vector
reaction/conservation. The proposed interface boundary condition is built upon
Burgers vector reaction kinetics and is applicable to any type of interfaces in
crystalline materials with any number of slip systems. This approach is applied
to predict slip transfer for any crystalline interface and stress state;
comparisons are made to widely-applied empirical methods. The results are
directly applicable to many existing dislocation plasticity simulation methods.

Interactions of collective excitations often lead to rich emergent phenomena
in many-particle quantum systems. In ordered magnets, the elementary
excitations are spin waves (magnons), which obey Bose-Einstein statistics.
Similar to the Cooper pairs in superconductors, magnons can be paired into
bound states under attractive interactions. Even more interestingly, the Zeeman
coupling to a magnetic field acts as a chemical potential that can tune the
particle density through a quantum critical point (QCP), beyond which a
``hidden order'' is predicted to exist. However, experimental confirmation of
this QCP and the associated new state of matter remain elusive. Here we report
direct observation of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of the two-magnon
bound state in Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$. Comprehensive thermodynamic measurements
confirmed the existence of a two-dimensional BEC-QCP at the saturation field.
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed to accurately establish
the magnetic exchange model. An exact solution of the model found stable
2-magnon bound states that were further confirmed by an electron spin resonance
(ESR) experiment, demonstrating that the QCP is due to the pair condensation
and the phase below saturation field is the long-sought-after spin nematic (SN)
phase.

Glitches, spin-up events in neutron stars, are of prime interest as they
reveal properties of nuclear matter at subnuclear densities. We numerically
investigate the glitch mechanism using analogies between neutron stars and
magnetic dipolar gases in the supersolid phase. In rotating neutron stars,
glitches are believed to occur when many superfluid vortices unpin from the
interior, transferring angular momentum to the stellar surface. In the
supersolid analogy, we show that a glitch happens when vortices pinned in the
low-density inter-droplet region abruptly unpin. These supersolid glitches show
remarkable parallels with neutron star glitches: they are characterized by a
rapid spin-up followed by a long post-glitch spin-down due to relaxation
towards a steady state. Dipolar supersolids offer an unprecedented possibility
to test both the vortex and crystal dynamics during a glitch. Here, we explore
the glitch dependence on the supersolid quality, finding strong suppression at
the supersolid-to-solid transition. This provides a tool to study glitches
originating from different radial depths of a neutron star. Benchmarking our
theory against neutron star observations, our work will open a new avenue for
the quantum simulation of stellar objects from Earth.

Broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) is an advanced Raman
spectroscopy method that combines the spectral sensitivity of spontaneous Raman
scattering (SR) with the increased signal intensity of single-frequency
coherent Raman techniques. These two features make BCARS particularly suitable
for ultra-fast imaging of heterogeneous samples, as already shown in
biomedicine. Recent studies demonstrated that BCARS also shows exceptional
spectroscopic capabilities when inspecting crystalline materials like lithium
niobate and lithium tantalate, and can be used for fast imaging of
ferroelectric domain walls. These results strongly suggest the extension of
BCARS towards new imaging applications like mapping defects, strain, or dopant
levels, similar to standard SR imaging. Despite these advantages, BCARS suffers
from a spurious and chemically unspecific non-resonant background (NRB) that
distorts and shifts the Raman peaks. Nevertheless, the NRB also serves as a
heterodyne amplifier of the resonant signal, making it particularly beneficial
for identifying weak Raman peaks. Post-processing numerical algorithms are then
used to remove the NRB and to obtain spectra comparable to SR results. Here, we
show the reproducibility of BCARS by conducting an internal Round Robin with
two different BCARS experimental setups, comparing the results on different
crystalline materials of increasing structural complexity: diamond, 6H SiC,
KDP, and KTP. First, we compare the detected and phase-retrieved signals, the
NRBremoval steps, and the mode assignment. Then we show that the influence of
pump wavelength, pulse width, and detection geometry can be accounted for to
obtain data not dependent on the setup characteristics. Finally, we compare and
optimize measurement parameters for the highspeed, hyperspectral imaging of
ferroelectric domain walls in lithium niobate.

Biological microswimmers such as bacteria and sperm cells often encounter
complex biological fluid environments. Here we use the well-known squirmer
microswimmer model to show the importance of the local fluid microstructure and
non-continuum effects on their swimming speed in different polymeric and
filamentous fluids. Surprisingly, we find that different squirmer types move at
considerably different speed in filamentous fluids which cannot be explained by
existing continuum models, but by considering the local fluid and polymer
properties around the squirmers. Furthermore, direct squirmer-polymer
interactions slow down in particular pushers by trapping large stiff filaments
in a self-generated recirculation region in front of them.

The Ising model is one of the simplest and most well-established concepts to
simulate phase transformations in complex materials. However, its most central
constant, the interaction strength J between two nearest neighbors, is hard to
obtain. Here we show how this basic constant can be determined with a fractal
dimension analysis of measured domain structures. We apply this approach to
vanadium dioxide, a strongly correlated material with a first-order
insulator-to-metal phase-transition with enigmatic properties. We obtain a
nearest-neighbor interaction of 13.8 meV, a value close to the thermal energy
at room temperature. Consequently, even far below the transition temperature,
there are spontaneous local phase-flips from the insulating into the metallic
phase. These fluctuations explain several measured anomalies in VO$_2$, in
particular the low thermal carrier activation energy and the finite
conductivity of the insulating phase. As a method, our fractal dimension
analysis links the Ising model to macroscopic material constants for almost any
first-order phase transition.

<br>
<br>
We report on first direct observation of spontaneous fluctuations of
birefringence in glasses doped with rare-earth (RE) ions. The fluctuations were
observed in Nd$^{3+}$- and Yb$^{3+}$-doped glasses as polarization noise of the
laser beam transmitted through the sample in the region of the RE-ion
absorption. The noise was characterized by a flat (``white'') spectrum in the
range of frequencies up to 1 GHz and did not show any dependence on magnetic
field. The discovered polarization noise is interpreted in terms of structural
dynamics of glasses revealed at low temperatures and usually described in the
model of tunneling two-level systems (TLS). High sensitivity of the
polarization noise technique to this dynamics is related to small homogeneous
width of \textit{f-f} transitions of RE-ions in glasses and small spectral
width of the probe laser light. The discovered effect provides a new
experimental approach to studying low-temperature structural dynamics of
different disordered matrices and interactions of impurities with environment
in such media.

Reversible control of the topological invariants from nontrivial to trivial
states has fundamental implications for quantum information processors and
spintronics, by realizing of an on/off switch for robust and dissipationless
spin-current. Although mechanical strain has typically advantageous for such
control of topological invariants, it is often accompanied by in-plane
fractures and is not suited for high-speed, time-dependent operations. Here, we
use ultrafast optical and THz spectroscopy to investigate topological phase
transitions by light-driven strain in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a material that requires
substantial strain for $\mathrm{Z}_2$ switching. We show that Bi$_2$Se$_3$
experiences ultrafast switching from being a topological insulator with
spin-momentum-locked surfaces, to hybridized states and normal insulating
phases at ambient conditions. Light-induced strong out-of-plane strain can
suppress the surface-bulk coupling, enabling differentiation of surface and
bulk conductance at room temperature, far above the Debye temperature. We
illustrate various time-dependent sequences of transient hybridization, as well
as the switching operation of topological invariants by adjusting the
photoexcitation intensity. The abrupt alterations in both surface and bulk
transport near the transition point allow for coherent conductance modulation
at hyper-sound frequencies. Our findings regarding light-triggered ultrafast
switching of topological invariants pave the way for high-speed topological
switching and its associated applications.

<br>

We study the spectral statistics of a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model
subjected to kinetic driving; a form of Floquet engineering where the kinetic
energy is periodically driven in time with a zero time-average. As the
amplitude of the driving is increased, the ground state of the resulting
flat-band system passes from the Mott insulator regime to an exotic superfluid.
We show that this transition is associated with a change in the system's
spectral statistics from Poisson to GOE-type. Remarkably, and unlike in the
conventional Bose-Hubbard model, which we use as a benchmark, the details of
the GOE statistics are sensitive to the parity of both the particle number and
the lattice sites. We show how this effect arises from a hidden symmetry of the
Hamiltonian produced by this form of Floquet driving.

Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) has emerged as a promising platform to
explore exotic electronic phases. However, the formation of moir\'e patterns in
tBLG has thus far been confined to the introduction of twist angles between the
layers. Here, we propose heterostrained bilayer graphene (hBLG), as an
alternative avenue to access twist-angle-free moir\'e physics via lattice
mismatch. Using atomistic and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate
that uniaxial heterostrain can promote isolated flat electronic bands around
the Fermi level. Furthermore, the heterostrain-induced out-of-plane lattice
relaxation may lead to a spatially modulated reactivity of the surface layer,
paving the way for the moir\'e-driven chemistry and magnetism. We anticipate
that our findings can be readily generalized to other layered materials.

We explore possibilities of stabilizing a skyrmion (SkX) phase in the
frustrated antiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg model with DMI on a triangular
lattice at ambient conditions. We show that by stacking multiple AF layers and
coupling them with strong ferromagnetic (F) interaction the SkX phase stability
temperature window can be extended by several times. The transition temperature
increase is supported by the increasing number of layers and interlayer
interaction and thus room-temperature SkX phase could be achievable by proper
tailoring of the multilayer structure. Further, we demonstrate that in the
sandwich heterostructure, obtained by inserting a stiff F layer in between two
AF layers, the required external magnetic field can be completely replaced by
the effective field imposed by the F layer. Thus, one can design a
heterostructure with the SkX phase stabilized at relatively high temperatures
and zero field - the environment favorable for technological applications.

We investigate the fundamental viability of cooling ultracold atomic gases

resolution and destructiveness of optical imaging techniques imposes
constraints on the efficacy of feedback cooling, and that rapid
rethermalization is necessary for cooling thermal gases. We construct a simple
model to determine the limits to feedback cooling set by the visibility of
density fluctuations, measurement-induced heating, and three-body atomic
recombination. We demonstrate that feedback control can rapidly cool
high-temperature thermal clouds in quasi-2D geometries to degenerate
temperatures with minimal atom loss compared to traditional evaporation. Our
analysis confirms the feasibility of feedback cooling ultracold atomic gases,
providing a pathway to new regimes of cooling not achievable with current
approaches.

and determine the magnetic structures of the zero-field and magnetic
field-induced phases for $H$ along the $a$ and [-1 1 0] crystal directions. We
determine the experimental magnetic field-temperature ($H$, $T$)-phase diagram
and reproduce it by Monte-Carlo simulations of an effective spin exchange
Hamiltonian for one distorted kagome layer. Our model includes a strong axial
single-ion anisotropy and significantly smaller exchange couplings which span
up to the third-nearest neighbours within the layer. Single crystal inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal an almost flat, only weakly
dispersive mode around 7 meV that we use alongside bulk magnetization data to
deduce the crystal-electric field (CEF) scheme for the Tm$^{3+}$ ions. Random
phase approximation (RPA) calculations based on the determined CEF wave
functions of the two lowest quasi-doublets enable an estimation of the
interlayer coupling that is compatible with the experimental INS spectra. No
evidence for low-energy spin waves associated to the magnetic order was found,
which is consistent with the strongly Ising nature of the ground state.

Recently it was claimed that nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride exhibited a
near-ambient superconducting transition with a temperature of 294 K at a
pressure of only 10 kbar, this pressure being several orders of magnitude lower
than previously demonstrated for hydrides under pressure. In this paper, we
investigate within DFT+U the electronic structure of both parent lutetium
hydride LuH$_3$ and nitrogen doped lutetium hydride LuH$_{2.75}$N$_{0.25}$. We
calculated corresponding bands, density of states and Fermi surfaces. It is
shown that in the stoichiometric system the Lu-5d states cross the Fermi level
while the H-1s states make almost no contribution at the Fermi level. However,
with nitrogen doping, the N-2p states enter the Fermi level in large quantities
and bring together a significant contribution from the H-1s states. The
presence of N-2p and H-1s states at the Fermi level in a doped compound can
facilitate the emergence of superconductivity. For instance, nitrogen doping
almost doubles the value of DOS at the Fermi level. Simple BCS analysis shows
that the nitrogen doping of LuH$_3$ can provide T$_c$ more than 100K and even
increase it with further hole doping.

The asymmetry of spin-wave patterns in confined rectangular
Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ microstrips, both in single and double-strip geometries, is
quantified. The results of TR-STXM and micromagnetic simulations are compared.
For the TR-STXM measurements and the corresponding simulations the excitation
was a uniform microwave field with a fixed frequency of 9.43 GHz, while the
external static magnetic field was swept. In the easy axis orientation of the
analyzed microstrip, the results show a higher asymmetry for the double
microstrip design, indicating an influence of the additional microstrip placed
in close proximity to the analyzed one.

The electric-field control of magnetism is a highly promising and potentially
effective approach for achieving energy-efficient applications. In recent
times, there has been significant interest in the magneto-ionic effect in
synthetic antiferromagnets, primarily due to its strong potential in the
realization of high-density storage devices with ultra-low power consumption.
However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the magneto-ionic effect on
the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) remains elusive. In this study, we have
successfully identified that the magneto-ionic control of the properties of the
top ferromagnetic layer of the synthetic antiferromagnet (SyAFM), which is in
contact with the high ion mobility oxide, plays a pivotal role in driving the
observed gate-induced changes to the IEC. Our findings provide crucial insights
into the intricate interplay between stack structure and magnetoionic-field
effect on magnetic properties in synthetic antiferromagnetic thin film systems.

We investigate the relaxation dynamics in a chiral one-dimensional quantum
channel with finite range interactions, driven out of equilibrium by the
injection of high-energy electrons. While the distribution of high-energy
electrons, after dissipation of some of their energy, has been examined
previously (arXiv:2108.00685), we study the distribution of charge carriers
excited from the channel's Fermi sea during this process. Utilizing a detector
to measure the energetic imprint in the Fermi sea downstream of the injection
point, we discover an initial symmetry in the distribution of excited electrons
and holes relative to the Fermi level. However, this symmetry breaks down with
stronger interactions and increased propagation distances, attributed to terms
of order four and beyond in the interaction. We provide an intuitive
interpretation of these results in terms of interference between states with
different numbers of plasmons in the Fermi sea.

We consider a one-dimensional system of non-interacting fermions featuring
both boundary driving and continuous monitoring of the bulk particle density.
Due to the measurements, the expectation values of the local density and
current operators are random variables whose average behavior is described by a
well studied Lindblad master equation. By means of exact numerical
computations, we go beyond the averaged dynamics and study their full
probability distribution functions, focusing on the late-time stationary
regime. We find that, contrary to the averaged values, the spatial profiles of
the median density and current are non-trivial, exhibiting qualitative
differences as a function of the monitoring strength. At weak monitoring, the
medians are close to the means, displaying diffusive spatial profiles. At
strong monitoring, we find that the median density and current develop a
domain-wall and single-peak profile, respectively, which are suggestive of a
Zeno-like localization in typical quantum trajectories. While we are not able
to identify a sharp phase transition as a function of the monitoring rate, our
work highlights the usefulness of characterizing typical behavior beyond the
averaged values in the context of monitored many-body quantum dynamics.

Breaking of inversion symmetry leads to nonlinear and nonreciprocal electron
transport, in which the voltage response does not invert with the reversal of
the current direction. Many systems have incorporated inversion symmetry
breaking into their band or crystal structures. In this work, we demonstrate
that a conventional two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system with a back gate
shows non-reciprocal behavior (with voltage proportional to current squared) in
the quantum Hall regime, which depends on the out-of-plane magnetic field and
contact configuration. The inversion symmetry is broken due to the presence of
the back gate and magnetic field, and our phenomenological model provides a
qualitative explanation of the experimental data. Our results suggest a
universal mechanism that gives rise to non-reciprocal behavior in gated
samples.

The influence of surface oxygen vacancies on the oxygen evolution reaction on
bismuth vanadate is studied using hybrid density functional theory. Our
findings reveal the thermodynamic instability of the neutral unionized defect
(${\rm V}_{\rm O}^0$), leading to spontaneous ionization into ${\rm V}_{\rm
O}^{2+}$. By investigating the oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on both
stoichiometric and oxygen-deficient surfaces, we find that surface oxygen
vacancies reduce the reaction's thermodynamic overpotential, but only when the
defects are ionized. Moreover, the reaction pathway involves the formation of
surface-bound peroxide and superoxide ions as intermediates. Our work provides
insight into the nature of surface oxygen vacancies and shines new light on how
they may enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of semiconductors.

Nanoparticle self-assembly is an efficient bottom-up strategy for the
creation of nanostructures. In the standard approach, ligands are grafted on
the surfaces of nanoparticles to keep them separated and control interparticle
interactions. Ligands then remain secondary and usually are not expected to
order significantly during superstructure formation. Here, we investigate how
ligands can play a more primary role in the formation of inorganic-organic
hybrid materials. We graft poly(2-iso-propyl-2-oxazoline) (PiPrOx) as a
crystallizable shell onto SiO$_2$ nanoparticles. By varying the PiPrOx grafting
density, solution stability, and nanoparticle aggregation behavior can be
controlled. Upon prolonged heating, anisotropic nanostructures form in
conjunction with the crystallization of the ligands. Self-assembly of hybrid
PiPrOx@SiO$_2$ (shell@core) nanoparticles proceeds in two steps: First, rapid
formation of amorphous aggregates via gelation, mediated by the interaction
between nanoparticles through grafted polymers; second, slow radial growth of
fibers via directional crystallization, governed by the incorporation of
crystalline ribbons formed from unbound polymers coupling to the grafted
polymer shell. Our work reveals how crystallization-driven self-assembly of
ligands can create intricate hybrid nanostructures.

<h3>Magnetochiral anisotropy-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit  coupled Rashba conductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09993" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09993</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically predict the existence of a non-zero magnetochiral
anisotropy-induced nonlinear Hall effect or a second harmonic Hall voltage
transverse to an applied current in spin-orbit coupled Rashba conductors in the
presence of a large in-plane magnetic field B. This is distinct from the Berry
curvature dipole-induced nonlinear Hall effect in systems with non-trivial
bandstructure because the former requires broken time reversal symmetry while
the latter is non-zero even in time reversal symmetric systems with broken
inversion symmetry. We calculate the effect by considering the local change in
the single particle energy due to the applied electric field E and expanding
the electron distribution function perturbatively up to the quadratic order in
the electric field. We find that, for E||B, the magnitude of the nonlinear Hall
current flowing in a direction perpendicular to the applied electric field is
exactly 1/3 of the magnitude of the magnetochiral anisotropy-induced
rectification current obtained in the E\perp B configuration, which has already
been successfully measured in Rashba systems.
