<h3>Collapse and expansion kinetics of a single polyelectrolyte chain with  hydrodynamic interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00146</a>
<br>
<i>Jiaxing Yuan, Tine Curk</i>
<p>We investigate the collapse and expansion dynamics of a linear
polyelectrolyte (PE) with hydrodynamic interactions. Using dissipative particle
dynamics with a bead-spring PE model, long-range electrostatics and explicit
ions we examine how the timescales of collapse $t_\text{col}$ and expansion
$t_\text{exp}$ depend on the chain length $N$, and obtain scaling relationships
$t_\text{col}\sim N^\alpha$ and $t_\text{exp}\sim N^\beta$. For neutral
polymers, we derive values of $\alpha=0.94\pm0.01$ and $\beta=1.97\pm0.10$.
Interestingly, the introduction of electrostatic interaction markedly shifts
$\alpha$ to $\alpha\approx1.4\pm0.1$ for salt concentrations within $c=10^{-4}$
M to $10^{-2}$ M. A reduction in ion-to-monomer size ratio noticeably reduces
$\alpha$. On the other hand, the expansion scaling remains approximately
constant, $\beta \approx 2$, regardless of salt concentration or ion size
considered. We find $\beta > \alpha$ for all conditions considered, implying
that expansion is always slower than collapse in the limit of long polymers.

<p>The thesis explores calculating tunneling current densities between planar
conducting electrodes in an STM. It considers factors like bias voltages and
the separation between electrodes, using Fermi energy and work functions. Pauli
blocking effects on forward and reverse current densities are introduced,
comparing Airy function solutions with WKB results. A 'Russell Potential' is
defined for field lines, considering non-linearities and image force effects. A
multi-slice method using the transfer matrix approach calculates tunneling
currents for the Russell Potential and trapezoid + image force potentials. The
Simmons image potential's unreasonable enhancement of tunneling currents
prompts the construction of models with distributed charge, which show
negligible image effects compared to trapezoidal potentials. Tunneling currents
increase with bias voltage, decrease exponentially with tip-sample distance,
and rise with increasing tip curvature radius. The resolving power of the STM
degrades with blunter tips, higher bias voltages, and increased tip-sample
distances. In essence, the thesis covers calculating tunneling current
densities in STM, exploring different potential models and their effects. It
discusses factors influencing tunneling behavior, like bias voltage, tip-sample
distance, and tip curvature, revealing limitations in imaging capabilities
under certain conditions.

<h3>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in warm-dense Fe compounds beyond  the SASE FEL resolution limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00039" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00039</a>

<p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) is a widely used spectroscopic
technique, providing access to the electronic structure and dynamics of atoms,
molecules, and solids. However, RIXS requires a narrow bandwidth x-ray probe to
achieve high spectral resolution. The challenges in delivering an energetic
monochromated beam from an x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) thus limit its use
in few-shot experiments, including for the study of high energy density
systems. Here we demonstrate that by correlating the measurements of the
self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) spectrum of an XFEL with the RIXS
signal, using a dynamic kernel deconvolution with a neural surrogate, we can
achieve electronic structure resolutions substantially higher than those
normally afforded by the bandwidth of the incoming x-ray beam. We further show
how this technique allows us to discriminate between the valence structures of
Fe and Fe$_2$O$_3$, and provides access to temperature measurements as well as
M-shell binding energies estimates in warm-dense Fe compounds.

<h3>Critical behavior of the Fredenhagen-Marcu order parameter at  topological phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00127" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00127</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</i>
<p>A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological phase transitions has
been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). In this work, we find that the FM
string order parameter for the toric code in a magnetic field exhibits
universal scaling behavior near critical points by directly evaluating it in
the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States
(iPEPS). Our results thus indicate that the FM string order parameter is a
quantitatively good order parameter to characterize topological phase
transitions. In the presence of the electric-magnetic duality symmetry, a novel
critical exponent can be extracted from the FM string order parameter, which is
consistent with the (2+1)D XY universality class. In addition, we argue that
only in the regime with emergent 1-form Wilson loop symmetry, the corresponding
FM string order parameter can faithfully detect the topological transition.

<h3>Magnetic polarons beyond linear spin-wave theory: Mesons dressed by  magnons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00130" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00130</a>
<br>
<i>Pit Bermes, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</i>
<p>When a mobile hole is doped into an antiferromagnet, its movement will
distort the surrounding magnetic order and yield a magnetic polaron. The
resulting complex interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom gives rise to
very rich physics and is widely believed to be at the heart of high-temperature
superconductivity in cuprates. In this paper, we develop a quantitative
theoretical formalism, based on the phenomenological parton description, to
describe magnetic polarons in the strong coupling regime. We construct an
effective Hamiltonian with weak coupling to the spin-wave excitations in the
background, making the use of standard polaronic methods possible. Our starting
point is a single hole doped into an AFM described by a 'geometric string'
capturing the strongly correlated hopping processes of charge and spin degrees
of freedom, beyond linear spin-wave approximation. Subsequently, we introduce
magnon excitations through a generalized 1/S expansion and derive an effective
coupling of these spin-waves to the hole plus the string (the meson) to arrive
at an effective polaron Hamiltonian with density-density type interactions.
After making a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation, this system is solved using
the self-consistent Born approximation to extract the renormalized polaron
properties. We apply our formalism (i) to calculate beyond linear spin-wave
ARPES spectra, (ii) to reveal the interplay of ro-vibrational meson
excitations, and (ii) to analyze the pseudogap expected at low doping.
Moreover, our work paves the way for exploring magnetic polarons out-of
equilibrium or in frustrated systems, where weak-coupling approaches are
desirable and going beyond linear spin-wave theory becomes necessary.

<h3>Strain induced phase transition from antiferromagnet to altermagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00151</a>
<br>
<i>Atasi Chakraborty, Rafael González Hernández, Libor šmejkal, Jairo Sinova</i>
<p>The newly discovered altermagnets are unconventional collinear compensated
magnetic systems, exhibiting even (d, g, or i-wave) spin-polarization order in
the band structure, setting them apart from conventional collinear ferromagnets
and antiferromagnets. Altermagnets offer advantages of spin polarized current
akin to ferromagnets, and THz functionalities similar to antifferomagnets,
while introducing new novel effects like spin-splitter currents. A key
challenge for future applications and functionalization of altermagnets, is to
demonstrate controlled transitioning to the altermagnetic phase from other
conventional phases in a single material. Here we prove a viable path towards
overcoming this challenge through a strain-induced transition from an
antiferromagnetic to an altermagnetic phase in ReO$_2$. Combining spin group
symmetry analysis and \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we demonstrate that
under compressive strain ReO$_2$ undergoes such transition, lifting the
Kramer's degeneracy of the band structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in the
non-relativistic regime. In addition, we show that this magnetic transition is
accompanied by a metal insulator transition, and calculate the distinct spin
polarized spectral functions of the two phases, which can be detected in angle
resolved photo-emission spectroscopy experiments.

<h3>The ab initio amorphous materials database: Empowering machine learning  to decode diffusivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00177</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Zheng, Eric Sivonxay, Max Gallant, Ziyao Luo, Matthew McDermott, Patrick Huck, Kristin A. Persson</i>
<p>Amorphous materials exhibit unique properties that make them suitable for
various applications in science and technology, ranging from optical and
electronic devices and solid-state batteries to protective coatings. However,
data-driven exploration and design of amorphous materials is hampered by the
absence of a comprehensive database covering a broad chemical space. In this
work, we present the largest computed amorphous materials database to date,
generated from systematic and accurate \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics
(AIMD) calculations. We also show how the database can be used in simple
machine-learning models to connect properties to composition and structure,
here specifically targeting ionic conductivity. These models predict the Li-ion
diffusivity with speed and accuracy, offering a cost-effective alternative to
expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the
process of computational quenching amorphous materials provides a unique
sampling of out-of-equilibrium structures, energies, and force landscape, and
we anticipate that the corresponding trajectories will inform future work in
universal machine learning potentials, impacting design beyond that of
non-crystalline materials.

<p>We report the results of radioactivity assays and heat leak calculations for
a range of common cryogenic materials, considered for use in the QUEST-DMC
superfluid 3He dark matter detector. The bolometer, instrumented with
nanomechanical resonators, will be sensitive to energy deposits from dark
matter interactions. Events from radioactive decays and cosmic rays constitute
a significant background and must be precisely modelled, using a combination of
material screening and Monte Carlo simulations. However, the results presented
here are of wider interest for experiments and quantum devices sensitive to
minute heat leaks and spurious events, thus we present heat leak per unit mass
or surface area for every material studied. This can inform material choices
for other experiments, especially if underground operation is considered where
the radiogenic backgrounds will dominate even at shallow depths.

<h3>SuperDiff: Diffusion Models for Conditional Generation of Hypothetical  New Families of Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00198" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00198</a>
<br>
<i>Samuel Yuan, S.V. Dordevic</i>
<p>Effective computational search holds great potential for aiding the discovery
of High-Temperature Superconductors (HTSs), especially given the lack of
systematic methods for their discovery. Recent progress has been made in this
area with machine learning, especially with deep generative models, which have
been able to outperform traditional manual searches at predicting new
superconductors within existing superconductor families but have yet to be able
to generate completely new families of superconductors. We address this
limitation by implementing conditioning -- a method to control the generation
process -- for our generative model and develop SuperDiff, a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with Iterative Latent Variable Refinement
(ILVR) conditioning for HTS discovery -- the first deep generative model for
superconductor discovery with conditioning. With SuperDiff, by being able to
control the generation process, we were able to computationally generate
completely new families of hypothetical superconductors for the very first
time. Given that SuperDiff also has relatively fast training and inference
times, it has the potential to be a very powerful tool for accelerating the
discovery of new superconductors and enhancing our understanding of them.

<h3>Structural and optical properties of self-assembled AlN nanowires grown  on SiO2/Si substrates by molecular beam epitaxy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00216" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00216</a>
<br>
<i>Ž. Gačević, J. Grandal, Q. Guo, R. Kirste, M. Varela, Z. Sitar, M.A. Sánchez García</i>
<p>Self assembled AlN nanowires (NWs) are grown by plasma assisted molecular
beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on SiO2 / Si (111) substrates. Using a combination of
in-situ reflective high energy electron diffraction and ex situ X ray
diffraction (XRD), we show that the NWs grow nearly strain free, preferentially
perpendicular to the amorphous SiO2 interlayer and without epitaxial
relationship to Si(111) substrate, as expected. Scanning electron microscopy
investigation reveals significant NWs coalescence, which results in their
progressively increasing diameter and formation of columnar structures with non
hexagonal cross section. Making use of scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), the NWs initial diameters are found in the 20 to 30 nm
range. In addition, the formation of a thin (30 nm) polycrystalline AlN layer
is observed on the substrate surface. Regarding the structural quality of the
AlN NWs, STEM measurements reveal the formation of extended columnar regions,
which grow with a virtually perfect metal-polarity wurtzite arrangement and
with extended defects only sporadically observed. Combination of STEM and
electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveals the formation of continuous
aluminum oxide (1 to 2 nm) on the NW surface. Low temperature photoluminescence
measurements reveal a single near band edge (NBE) emission peak, positioned at
6.03 eV (at 2 K), a value consistent with nearly zero NW strain evidenced by
XRD and in agreement with the values obtained on AlN bulk layers synthesized by
other growth techniques. The significant full width at half maximum of NBE
emission, found at 20 meV (at 2 K), suggests that free and bound excitons are
mixed together within this single emission band.

<h3>Yielding under the microscope: a multi-scale perspective on brittle and  ductile behaviors in oscillatory shear</h3>

<i>P. Edera, M. Brizioli, M. Madani, E. Ngouamba, P. Coussot, V. Trappe, G. Petekidis, F. Giavazzi, R. Cerbino</i>
<p>We study the yielding transition in soft jammed materials under oscillatory
shear, employing a novel methodology that combines rheological measurements
with detailed dynamical observations. This method provides a comprehensive view
of the intricate interactions between macroscopic mechanical behavior,
mesoscopic deformation patterns, and microscopic dynamics during yielding. Our
findings reveal two distinct yielding behaviors: at one end, a smooth, uniform
transition, characterized by homogeneous strain fields, and Fickian, Gaussian
microscopic dynamics; at the other, a sharp transition defined by pronounced
shear banding, with the dynamics within shear bands being governed exclusively
by the local strain, and exhibiting non-Gaussian, cooperative nature. The
viscoplastic fragility emerges as a key macroscopic predictor of these
intricate behaviors across micro- and meso-scales, providing a new perspective
to understand and quantify ductile and brittle yielding in soft materials.

<h3>Formation mechanisms of single-crystalline InN quantum dots fabricated  via droplet epitaxy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00223</a>
<br>
<i>P. Aseev, Ž. Gačević, J.M. Mánuel, J.J. Jiménez, R. García, F.M. Morales, E. Calleja</i>
<p>This work presents an experimental and theoretical insight into formation
mechanisms of single crystalline wurtzite InN quantum dots (QDs) fabricated via
metal droplet epitaxy (DE) by employing plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy.
The applied procedure consists of two fabrication stages. During the first
stage, the cold substrate (T = 15 {\deg}C) is exposed to an impinging In flux,
resulting in formation of metallic In droplets on the substrate surface, and
then to an impinging active nitrogen flux, resulting in In conversion into
polycrystalline InN islands. During the second stage, the substrate, which is
still kept exposed to active nitrogen, is heated up to T = 300 {\deg}C, to
allow for the reorganization of extended polycrystalline InN islands into
groups of independent single crystalline wurtzite InN QDs. This work provides a
detailed experimental insight into both fabrication stages and their
qualitative explanations within the scopes of adatom surface kinetics (stage I)
and total energy per unit crystal volume minimization (stage II). Finally, the
formation mechanisms of InN QDs on the three different substrates (Si(111),
Si(001) and In0.3Ga0.7N/Si(111)) are compared, and also linked to the formation
mechanisms of other more studied nanostructures, such as self assembled GaN/AlN
QDs and self assembled and selective area grown GaN nanowires.

<h3>Strain-induced speed-up of Mn$^{2+}$ spin-lattice relaxation in  (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells: a time-resolved ODMR study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00228" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00228</a>
<br>
<i>Aleksander Bogucki, Aleksandra Łopion, Karolina Ewa Połczyńska, Wojciech Pacuski, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Andrzej Golnik, Piotr Kossacki</i>
<p>This study examines the spin-lattice relaxation rate of Mn$^{2+}$ ions in
strained diluted magnetic semiconductor (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells using
the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique. By adjusting the
magnesium (Mg) content in the buffer layer, we created samples with different
strain levels. Our time-resolved ODMR results show that the spin-lattice
relaxation time becomes faster as strain increases. We also found that the
relaxation rate increases with both magnetic field and temperature, showing a
power-law behavior. To understand these observations, we used a theoretical
model based on six-level rate equations with non-equal level separations. This
model suggests that the main factor affecting relaxation in our samples is a
"direct" mechanism. The model's predictions match well with our experimental
data. Overall, our findings give insights into spin-lattice relaxation in
strained quantum wells and could be important for the development of future
quantum and spintronic devices.

<h3>Coherent all-optical control of a solid-state spin via a double  $Λ$-system</h3>

<i>C. Adambukulam, J. A. Scott, S. Q. Lim, I. Aharonovich, A. Morello, A. Laucht</i>
<p>All-optical control enables fast quantum operations on color center spins
that are typically realized via a single Raman transition in a
$\Lambda$-system. Here, we simultaneously drive both Raman transitions in a
double $\Lambda$-system to control the spin of a germanium vacancy (GeV) in
diamond. In doing so, we achieve fast operations, observe the quantum
interference between the two Raman transitions and probe the GeV coherence
($T_2^*=224\pm14$ ns, $T_2^{\rm H}=11.9\pm0.3$ $\mu$s). Importantly, control
via a double $\Lambda$-system is applicable to other color centers and
particularly, the group-IV defects in diamond.

<i>Songrui Hou, Fengjiao Pan, Xinping Shi, Zahra Ebrahim Nataj, Fariborz Kargar, Alexander A. Balandin, David G. Cahill, Chen Li, Zhifeng Ren, Richard B. Wilson</i>
<p>Materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to conduct heat away from
hot spots in power electronics and optoelectronic devices. Cubic boron arsenide
(c-BAs) has a high thermal conductivity due to its special phonon dispersion
relation. Previous experimental studies of c-BAs report a room-temperature
thermal conductivity between 1000 and 1300 watts per meter-kelvin. We
synthesized high purity c-BAs single crystals with room-temperature thermal
conductivity of 1500 watts per meter-kelvin. We observed its thermal
conductivity to be proportional to the inverse square of temperature between
300 and 600 kelvin, a stronger dependence than predicted by state-of-the-art
theory.

<h3>Quantum phase transitions and composite excitations of antiferromagnetic  quantum spin trimer chains in a magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00272" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00272</a>
<br>
<i>Jun-Qing Cheng, Zhi-Yao Ning, Han-Qing Wu, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<p>Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies on
the high-energy excitations, we theoretically explore the quantum phase
transitions and composite excitations of the antiferromagnetic trimer chains in
a magnetic field using the exact diagonalization, density matrix
renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle and cluster
perturbation theory. We utilize the entanglement entropy to uncover the phase
diagram, encompassing the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II and
ferromagnetic phases. The critical XY-I and XY-II phases are both described by
the conformal field theory with the central charge $c \simeq 1$. We reveal the
diverse features of spin dynamics in various phases by using the dynamical
structure factor. In the weak intertrimer interaction regime, we identify the
intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization
plateau phases as the internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the
propagation of doublon and quarton, respectively. Notably, the magnetic field
splits the high-energy spectra into two branches labeled as the upper quarton
and lower quarton. Furthermore, we also explore the spin dynamics of a
trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12},
and discuss the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation. Our
results can be verified in the inelastic neutron scattering experiments and
provide deep insights for exploring the high-energy exotic excitations.

<h3>Phantom Chain Simulations for Fracture of End-linking Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00278" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00278</a>
<br>
<i>Yuichi Masubuchi</i>
<p>Despite numerous studies, the relationship between network structure and
fracture remains unclear. In this study, the fracture properties of end-linking
networks were compared with those of loop-free analogs made from star
prepolymers by performing phantom chain simulations. The networks were created
from equilibrated sols of stoichiometric mixtures of linear prepolymers and
f-functional linkers through end-linking reactions using Brownian dynamics
schemes. The examined networks, with various f values (between 3 and 8) and
strand-connection rates ({\phi}_s), were evaluated in terms of the primary loop
fraction and the cycle rank {\xi}. These structural characteristics were
consistent with mean-field theories that assume independent reactions. Energy
minimization and uniaxial stretch were applied to the networks until they broke
without Brownian motion. The fracture characteristics, including strain
({\epsilon}_b), stress ({\sigma}_b), and work for fracture (W_b), were obtained
from stress-strain curves. The end-linking networks exhibited larger
{\epsilon}_b and smaller {\sigma}_b and W_b than those for star networks due to
primary loops, at the same set of f and {\phi}_s. However, {\epsilon}_b,
{\sigma}_b/{\nu}_br and W_b/{\nu}_br (with {\nu}_br being the branch point
density) lie on the same master curves as those for star networks if they are
plotted against {\xi}. This result implies that the fracture of end-linking
networks is essentially the same as that for star analogs, and the effects of
primary loops are embedded in {\xi}.

<h3>A link between anomalous viscous loss and boson peak in soft jammed  solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00291" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00291</a>
<br>
<i>Yusuke Hara, Ryosuke Matsuoka, Hiroyuki Ebata, Daisuke Mizuno, Atsushi Ikeda</i>
<p>Soft jammed solids exhibit intriguing mechanical properties, while their
linear response is elusive. In particular, foams and emulsions generally reveal
anomalous viscous loss with the loss and storage modulus following $G^{\prime
\prime} \propto \sqrt{\omega}$ and $G^{\prime} \propto \omega^0$. In this
study, we offer a comprehensive microscopic understanding of this behavior.
Using microrheology experiment, we measured $G^* = G^{\prime} + i G^{\prime
\prime}$ of concentrated emulsions in a wide range of frequencies. In theory,
we applied a linear response formalism for microrheology to a soft sphere model
that undergoes the jamming transition. We find that the theory quantitatively
explains the experiments without the need for parameter adjustments. Our
analysis reveals that the anomalous viscous loss results from the boson peak,
which is a universal vibrational property of amorphous solids and reflects the
marginal stability in soft jammed solids. We discuss that the anomalous viscous
loss is universal in systems with various interparticle interactions as it
stems from the universal boson peak, and it even survives below the jamming
density where thermal fluctuation is pronounced and the dynamics becomes
inherently nonlinear.

<h3>Exploring inverse orbital Hall and orbital Rashba effects: unveiling the  oxidation states of the Cu surface</h3>

<p>In this work, employing spin-pumping techniques driven by both ferromagnetic
resonance (SP-FMR) and longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) to manipulate
and direct observe orbital currents, we investigated the volume conversion of
spin-orbital currents into charge-current in YIG(100nm)/Pt(2nm)/NM2 structures,
where NM2 represents Ti or Ru. While the YIG/Ti bilayer displayed a negligible
SP-FMR signal, the YIG/Pt/Ti structure exhibited a significantly stronger
signal attributed to the orbital Hall effect of Ti. Substituting the Ti layer
with Ru revealed a similar phenomenon, wherein the effect is ascribed to the
combined action of both spin and orbital Hall effects. Furthermore, we measured
the SP-FMR signal in the YIG/Pt(2)/Ru(6)/Ti(6) and YIG/Pt(2)/Ti(6)/Ru(6)
heterostructures by just altering the stack order of Ti and Ru layers, where
the peak value of the spin pumping signal is larger for the first sample. To
verify the influence on the oxidation of Ti and Ru films, we studied a series
of thin films subjected to controlled and natural oxidation. As Cu and CuOx is
a system that is already known to be highly influenced by oxidation, this metal
was chosen to carry out this study. We investigated these samples using SP-FMR
in YIG/Pt(2)/CuOx(tCu) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy and concluded that
samples with natural oxidation of Cu exhibit more significant results than
those when the CuOx is obtained by reactive sputtering. In particular, samples
where the Cu layer is naturally oxidized exhibit a Cu2O-rich phase. Our
findings help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inverse orbital Hall
and inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein-like effects. These insights indeed
contribute to the advancement of devices that rely on orbital-charge
conversion.

<h3>Chiral superconducting diode effect by Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00317</a>
<br>
<i>Naratip Nunchot, Youichi Yanase</i>
<p>A two-component quasi-two-dimensional superconductor with
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction is studied based on the Ginzburg-Landau and
Bogoliubov-de Gennes theories. Under external in-plane magnetic fields, the
order parameter of the superconducting state is a type of the Fulde-Ferrell
state with a finite momentum of Cooper pairs due to the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya
interaction. It is shown that the superconducting diode effect can emerge when
a supercurrent flows parallel to the external magnetic field, characteristic of
chiral crystals. In the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, phase diagrams associated
with the transition of the Cooper-pair momentum and the Josephson phase between
spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs are derived, and a close
relationship with the diode quality factor is demonstrated. Implications of
critical currents in the aspect of thermodynamics are also discussed. Based on
such an argument, it is argued that the first-order phase transition in terms
of Cooper-pair momentum and the coexistence of phases with different
Cooper-pair momentum and Josephson phase can occur. The argument also implies
the issue with the definition of critical currents calculated from the extremes
of the supercurrent when metastable states exist. Comments on purely
two-dimensional superconductors are also given.

<h3>Enhancement of the catalytic activity upon the surface of strongly  disordered hollow Pt nanoparticles: a First Principles investigation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00343</a>
<br>
<i>Olivier Le Bacq</i>
<p>A series of First Principles calculations is undertaken to characterize and
explain the enhancement of the catalytic activity of oxygen on top of very
disordered nanomaterials of Pt. As the adsorption of OH fragment on top of the
surfaces is known as the limiting factor in the Oxygen Reduction Reactions
(ORR) process in these systems, our calculations propose to determine the
influence of the local geometry of the various sites on the adsorption energy
of OH in order to discover a simple descriptor allowing to predict the
reactivity at these surfaces as a function of their morphology and strain. For
this purpose, the geometry of Pt slabs with various thickness (3, 5 and 7
atomic layers) including a large number of point defects are optimized in order
to generate a very rich catalog of inequivalent sites of reactivity on both
surfaces of the slabs. Given the very large distortion of the geometry of the
sites, these latter had to be categorized into several classes for which the
behavior with respect to catalytic activity is determined. A new descriptor
taking into account the distortion of the geometry of the sites is introduced,
allowing to recover the linear dependence of the adsorption energy of OH with
respect to the effective coordination number of the sites, as observed in
highly symmetric and planar surfaces of Pt.

<h3>Defect Cluster Morphology in W from Collision Cascades: Results  Comparing Five Inter-atomic potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00359</a>
<br>
<i>M. Warrier, U. Bhardwaj</i>
<p>The size and morphology of defect clusters formed during primary damage play
an important part in the subsequent evolution of the micro-structure of
irradiated materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of collision cascades
in W have been carried out using five interatomic potentials (IAP) including
the quantum accurate machine learned (ML) spectral neighbor analysis potential
(WSNAP), the ML based tabGAP potential and three embedded atom method (EAM)
based potentials. A total of 3500 MD simulations with the primary knock-on
atoms (PKA) having energys 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100 and 150 keV were carried out.
The PKA are launched in hundred random directions at each of the PKA energies
to obtain statistically valid results. Analysis using CSaransh, a web based
tool to analyze a large collision cascade database, was carried out to obtain
the number of defects (individual and in clusters), the defect cluster
morphologies, the defect cluster size distributions and the number of
sub-cascades formed. It is seen that <1 1 1> clusters dominate across all the
inter-atomic potentials (IAP), except for the WSNAP potential. The WSNAP
potential shows significantly higher number of C-15 like rings across all PKA
energies. The WSNAP potential also shows a higher fraction of in-cluster
vacancies. It is also seen that the stiffness and range of IAP do not affect
the number of defects, defect clustering or vacancy clusters, but shows a
tendency to form more sub-cascades for PKA energies less than 60 keV.

<h3>Emergence of tension-compression asymmetry from a complete phase-field  approach to brittle fracture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00368</a>
<br>
<i>Chang Liu, Aditya Kumar</i>
<p>The classical variational approach to brittle fracture propagation does not
distinguish between strain energy accumulation in tension versus compression
and consequently results in physically unrealistic cracking under compression.
A variety of energy splits have been proposed as a possible remedy. However, a
unique energy split that can describe this asymmetry for general loading
conditions has not been found. The main objective of this paper is to show that
a complete phase-field theory of brittle fracture nucleation and propagation,
one that accounts for the material strength at large, can naturally capture the
tension-compression asymmetry without an energy split. One such theory has been
recently proposed by Kumar et al. (2018). Over the past few years, several
studies have shown that this theory is capable of accurately describing
fracture nucleation and propagation for materials soft and hard under arbitrary
monotonic loading conditions. However, a systematic study of the
tension-compression asymmetry that emerges from this theory has not yet been
reported. This paper does precisely that. In particular, this paper reports a
comprehensive study of crack propagation in two problems, one involving a
symmetric tension-compression state and the other involving larger compressive
stresses at the crack tip. The results are compared with popular energy splits
used in literature. The results show that, remarkably, for the second problem,
only the complete theory is able to produce experimentally consistent results.

<h3>Quantum information theoretic measures to distinguish fermionized bosons  from non-interacting fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00372</a>
<br>
<i>Barnali Chakrabarti, Arnaldo Gammal, N D Chavda, Mantile Leslie Lekala</i>
<p>We study the dynamical fermionization of strongly interacting one-dimensional
bosons in Tonks-Girardeau limit by solving the time dependent many-boson
Schr\"odinger equation numerically exactly. We establish that the one-body
momentum distribution approaches the ideal Fermi gas distribution at the time
of dynamical fermionization. The analysis is further complemented by the
measures on two-body level. Investigation on two-body momentum distribution,
two-body local and non-local correlation clearly distinguish the fermionized
bosons from non-interacting fermions. The magnitude of distinguishablity
between the two systems is further discussed employing suitable measures of
information theory, i.e., the well known Kullback-Leibler relative entropy and
the Jensen-Shannon divergence entropy. We also observe very rich structure in
the higher-body density for strongly correlated bosons whereas non-interacting
fermions do not possess any higher order correlation beyond two-body.

<h3>Superconductivity in $\textit{a}$-MoGe thin films: effect of phase  fluctuations with decreasing thickness and study of vortex dynamics in  presence of low-frequency ac excitation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00387" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00387</a>
<br>
<i>Soumyajit Mandal</i>
<p>In this thesis, we have studied the evolution of superconductivity in
amorphous Molybdenum Germanium ($\textit{a}$-MoGe) thin films. The work can be
broken down into two parts. In the first part, we investigate the effect of
decreasing thickness on the suppression of superconductivity in
$\textit{a}$-MoGe thin films. Thick $\textit{a}$-MoGe thin film is a typical
type-II superconductor and follows the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) equation. Conventionally, it is believed that decreasing thickness will
decrease the effective attractive pairing interaction because of the gradual
loss of screening which holds true for large thicknesses in $\textit{a}$-MoGe.
But for lower thicknesses, a new mechanism comes into the picture where
superfluid density is suppressed making the superconductor vulnerable to phase
fluctuations. This is known as the Bosonic mechanism, where superconductivity
is destroyed due to the loss of phase coherence of the superconducting state
even though the attractive pairing amplitude remains finite above the
transition temperature. In the second part, we explore the electromagnetic
response of vortices in $\textit{a}$-MoGe thin film by low-frequency two-coil
mutual inductance technique. Penetration depth measured from the two-coil
technique was earlier used to determine superfluid density. However in the
present work, by analyzing the in-field penetration depth data with the help of
a mean-field model proposed by Coffey and Clem, we have demonstrated a
procedure of extraction of vortex parameters such as pinning restoring force
constant or Labusch parameter, vortex lattice drag coefficient and pinning
potential barrier for the thermally activated motion of vortices. The
temperature variation of vortex parameters suggests the dominant effect of
thermal fluctuations.

<h3>Quantum liquid states of spin solitons in a ferroelectric spin-Peierls  state</h3>

<br>
<i>Shusaku Imajo, Atsushi Miyake, Ryosuke Kurihara, Masashi Tokunaga, Koichi Kindo, Sachio Horiuchi, Fumitaka Kagawa</i>
<p>In this study, we performed high-magnetic-field magnetization, dielectric,
and ultrasound measurements on an organic salt showing a ferroelectric
spin-Peierls (FSP) state, which is in close proximity to a quantum critical
point. In contrast to the sparsely distributed gas-like spin solitons typically
observed in conventional spin-Peierls (SP) states, the FSP state exhibits dense
liquid-like spin solitons resulting from strong quantum fluctuations, even at
low fields. Nevertheless, akin to conventional SP systems, a
magnetic-field-induced transition is observed in the FSP state. In conventional
high-field SP states, an emergent wave vector results in the formation of a
spin-soliton lattice. However, in the present high-field FSP state, the strong
quantum fluctuations preclude the formation of such a soliton lattice, causing
the dense solitons to remain in a quantum-mechanically melted state. This
observation implies the realization of a quantum liquid--liquid transition of
topological particles carrying spin and charge in a ferroelectric insulator.

<h3>Ralph Kenna's scaling relations in critical phenomena</h3>

<i>Leïla Moueddene, Arnaldo Donoso, Bertrand Berche</i>
<p>In this note, we revisit the scaling relations among ``hatted critical
exponents'' which were first derived by Ralph Kenna, Des Johnston and Wolfhard
Janke, and we propose an alternative derivation for some of them. For the
scaling relation involving the behavior of the correlation function, we will
propose an alternative form since we believe that the expression is erroneous
in the work of Ralph and his collaborators.

<br>
<i>José Coutinho, Diana Gomes, Vitor J. B. Torres, Tarek O. Abdul Fattah, Vladimir P. Markevich, Anthony R. Peaker</i>
<p>We present a theoretical account of some of the most likely hydrogen-related
reactions with impurities in n-type and p-type solar-grade silicon. These
include reactions with dopants and carbon, which are relevant in the context of
life-time degradation of silicon solar cells, most notably of light and
elevated temperature degradation (LeTID) of the cells. Among the problems
addressed, we highlight a comparative study of acceptor-enhanced dissociation
of hydrogen molecules in B- and Ga-doped material, their subsequent reaction
steps toward formation of acceptor-hydrogen pairs, the proposal of mechanisms
which explain the observed kinetics of photo-/carrier-induced dissociation of
PH and CH pairs in n-type Si, analysis of reactions involving direct
interactions between molecules with P and C, and the assignment of several
electron and hole traps with detailed atomistic- and wavefunction-resolved
models.

<h3>Electric field tunable edge transport in Bernal stacked trilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00461</a>
<br>
<i>Saurabh Kumar Srivastav, Adithi Udupa, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Diptiman Sen, Anindya Das</i>
<p>This letter presents a non-local study on the electric field tunable edge
transport in an hBN-encapsulated dual-gated Bernal stacked (ABA) trilayer
graphene across various displacement fields ($D$) and temperatures ($T$). Our
measurements revealed that the non-local resistance ($R_{NL}$) surpassed the
expected classical ohmic contribution by a factor of at least two orders of
magnitude. Through scaling analysis, we found that the non-local resistance
scales linearly with the local resistance ($R_{L}$) only when the $D$ exceeds a
critical value of $\sim0.2$ V/nm. Additionally, we observed that the scaling
exponent remains constant at unity for temperatures below the bulk-band gap
energy threshold ($T<25$ K). Further, the value of $R_{NL}$ decreases in a
linear fashion as the channel length ($L$) increases. These experimental
findings provide evidence for edge-mediated charge transport in ABA trilayer
graphene under the influence of a finite displacement field. Furthermore, our
theoretical calculations support these results by demonstrating the emergence
of dispersive edge modes within the bulk-band gap energy range when a
sufficient displacement field is applied.

<h3>A mechanism for electrostatically generated magnetoresistance in chiral  systems without spin-dependent transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00472</a>
<br>
<i>Sytze H. Tirion, Bart J. van Wees</i>
<p>Significant attention has been drawn to electronic transport in chiral
materials coupled to ferromagnets in the chirality induced spin selectivity
(CISS) effect. A large magnetoresistance (MR) is usually observed which is
widely interpreted to originate from spin (dependent) transport. However, there
are severe discrepancies between the experimental results and theoretical
interpretations, most notably the apparent failure of the Onsager reciprocity
relation in the linear response regime. We provide an alternative explanation
for the mechanism of the two terminal MR in chiral systems coupled to a
ferromagnet. For this we point out that it was observed that the electrostatic
contact potential of chiral materials on a ferromagnet depends on the
magnetization direction and chirality. In our explanation this causes the
transport barrier to be modified by the magnetization direction, already in
equilibrium, in the absence of a bias current. This strongly alters the charge
transport through/over the barrier, not requiring spin transport. This provides
a mechanism that allows the linear response resistance to be sensitive to the
magnetization direction and also explains the failure of the Onsager
reciprocity relations. We propose experimental configurations to confirm our
alternative mechanism for MR.

<h3>Investigating the multidimensional separation behavior of particles in a  cyclosizer setting -- A case study on calcite, fluorite and magnesite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00488" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00488</a>
<br>
<i>Johanna Sygusch, Thomas Wilhelm, Orkun Furat, Volker Schmidt, Martin Rudolph</i>
<p>Particle separation is typically investigated regarding one particulate
property only. Virtually all separation processes, however, act on various
particle properties in different ways. Modern particle analytical modalities
enable a statistically meaningful multidimensional particle characterization.
Within this study, individual particle fractions of magnesite, calcite and
fluorite (-71 $\mu m$) are processed via the turbulent cross-flow separator
cascade Cyclosizer (M16, MARC Technologies Pty Ltd), consisting of 5
hydrocyclones, thus producing 5 different product streams. Particle
characterization is achieved via dynamic image analysis from which information
on the particle shape and size is obtained. Using this data, bivariate Tromp
functions are computed, which show the combined effect of the particle
descriptors of roundness and area-equivalent diameter on the separation
behavior. While the first cyclones recover predominantly coarse particles with
high roundness values, fine particles with varying roundness are recovered in
the latter cyclones.

<h3>Large scale zigzag pattern emerging from circulating active shakers</h3>

<br>
<i>Gaspard Junot, Marco De Corato, Pietro Tierno</i>
<p>We report the emergence of large zigzag bands in a population of reversibly
actuated magnetic rotors that behave as active shakers, namely squirmers that
shake the fluid around them without moving. The shakers collectively organize
into dynamic structures displaying self-similar growth, and generate
topological defects in form of cusps that connect vortices of rolling particles
with alternating chirality. By combining experimental analysis with
particle-based simulation, we show that the special flow field created by the
shakers is the only ingredient needed to reproduce the observed spatiotemporal
pattern. We unveil a self-organization scenario in a collection of driven
particles in an viscoelastic medium emerging from the reduced particle degrees
of freedom, as here the frozen orientational motion of the shakers.

<h3>Polarization-induced stress in the noisy voter model</h3>

<br>
<i>Miguel Aguilar-Janita, Andres Blanco-Alonso, Nagi Khalil</i>
<p>A new model for the dynamics of opinion formation is proposed and analysed at
the mean-field level. It can be regarded as a generalization of the noisy voter
model in which agents update their binary states by copying others and by an
intrinsic mechanism affected by the degree of polarization in the system. It
also takes into account whether the agents enhance or reduce their intrinsic
mechanism upon increasing polarization. Four phases or shapes of the
steady-state probability of a fraction of agents in a given state are found
(unimodal, bimodal, W and M). In the unimodal (resp. bimodal) phase, the
copying (resp. intrinsic) mechanism is globally dominant, while in the W (resp.
M) phase the copying (resp. intrinsic) mechanism is the relevant one close to
the consensus states while it reduces its influence as approaching coexistence.
In the thermodynamic limit, the bimodal and W phases disappear, while the
unimodal and M phases prevail. The theoretical results, obtained analytically
from the master equation, and the numerical simulations are in good agreement.

<h3>Quantum Metric Nonlinear Spin-Orbit Torque Enhanced by Topological Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00532</a>
<br>
<i>Xukun Feng, Weikang Wu, Hui Wang, Weibo Gao, Lay Kee Ang, Y. X. Zhao, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang</i>
<p>Effects manifesting quantum geometry have been a focus of physics research.
Here, we reveal that quantum metric plays a crucial role in nonlinear electric
spin response, leading to a quantum metric spin-orbit torque. We argue that
enhanced quantum metric can occur at band (anti)crossings, so the nonlinear
torque could be amplified in topological metals with nodal features close to
Fermi level. By applying our theory to magnetic Kane-Mele model and monolayer
CrSBr, which feature nodal lines and Weyl points, we demonstrate that the
quantum metric torque dominates the response, and its magnitude is
significantly enhanced by topological band structures, which even surpasses the
previously reported linear torques and is sufficient to drive magnetic
switching by itself.

<h3>Absence of Induced Ferromagnetism in Epitaxial Uranium Dioxide Thin  Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00546" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00546</a>
<br>
<i>William Thomas, Fabrice Wilhelm, Sean Langridge, Lottie. M Harding, Christopher Bell, Ross Springell, Sven Friedemann, Roberto Caciuffo, Gerrard. H Lander</i>
<p>Recently, Sharma et al. [Adv. Sci. 9, 2203473 (2022)] claimed that thin films
(around 20 nm) of UO2 deposited on perovskite substrates exhibit strongly
enhanced paramagnetism (called induced ferromagnetism by the authors). Moments
of up to 3 Bohr magneton/U atom were claimed in magnetic fields of 6 T. We have
reproduced such films and, after characterisation, have examined them with
X-ray circular magnetic dichroism (XMCD) at the uranium M edges, a technique
that is element specific. We do not confirm the published results. We find a
small increase, as compared to the bulk, in the magnetic susceptibility of UO2
in such films, but the magnetisation versus field curves, measured by XMCD, are
linear with field and there is no indication of any ferromagnetism. The absence
of any anomaly around 30 K (the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of bulk
UO2) in the XMCD signal suggests the films do not order magnetically.

<h3>Effect of the spin crossover of local copper-oxygen states on the  electronic structure of HTSC cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00547" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00547</a>
<br>
<i>Ilya Makarov, Sergey Ovchinnikov</i>
<p>In this work, the effect of uniaxial pressure along the c axis on the
electronic structure of the HTSC cuprate La2-xSrxCuO4 is investigated at the
doping levels x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.25. The GTB method within the five-band p-d
model framework is used to describe the electron system. The uniaxial
compression leads to a significant reconstruction of the electronic structure
and a change in the character of low-energy quasiparticle excitations: a large
contribution of a1g symmetry orbitals appears at the top of the valence band.
The crossover between the local Zhang-Rice singlet and the Emery-Reiter triplet
was found at the pressure Pc = 15.1 GPa. The characteristic changes in the
electronic structure under pressure occur abruptly as a result of the
crossover. In particular, the top of the valence band displaces to the region
around the k-point (pi,0), the Fermi contour transforms to the four pockets
around (0,0),(2pi,0),(0,2pi),(2pi,2pi) and the one contour around (pi,pi).

<h3>Topological Defects as Nucleation Points of the Nematic--Isotropic Phase  Transition in Liquid Crystal Shells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00552" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00552</a>
<br>
<i>Yucen Han, Jan Lagerwall, Apala Majumdar</i>
<p>The transition from a nematic to an isotropic state in a self-closing
spherical liquid crystal shell with tangential alignment is a stimulating
phenomenon to investigate, as the topology dictates that the shell exhibits
local isotropic points at all temperatures in the nematic phase range, in the
form of topological defects. The defects may thus be expected to act as
nucleation points for the phase transition upon heating beyond the bulk nematic
stability range. Here we study this peculiar transition, theoretically and
experimentally, for shells with two different configurations of four +1/2
defects, finding that the defects act as the primary nucleation points if they
are co-localized in each other's vicinity. If the defects are instead spread
out across the shell, they again act as nucleation points, albeit not
necessarily the primary ones. Beyond adding to our understanding of how the
orientational order--disorder transition can take place in the shell geometry,
our results have practical relevance for, e.g., the use of curved liquid
crystals in sensing applications or for liquid crystal elastomer actuators in
shell shape, undergoing a shape change as a result of the nematic--isotropic
transition.

<h3>Mixed higher-order topology and nodal and nodeless flat band topological  phases in a superconducting multiorbital model</h3>

<br>
<i>Rodrigo Arouca, Tanay Nag, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<p>We investigate the topological phases that appear in an orbital version of
the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model in the presence of conventional
spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and with the possibility of tuning an
in-plane magnetic field. We chart out the phase diagram by considering
different boundary conditions, with the topology of the individual phases
further examined by considering both the Wannier and entanglement spectra, as
well as the Majorana polarization.
For weak to moderate values of magnetic field and superconducting pairing
amplitude, we find a second-order topological superconductor phase with eight
zero-energy corner modes. Further increasing field or pairing, half of the
corner states can be turned into zero-energy edge-localized modes, thus forming
a type of hybrid-order phase. Then, we find two different putative first-order
topological phases, a nodal and a nodeless phase, both with zero-energy flat
bands localized along mirror-symmetric open edges. For the nodal phase, the
flat bands are localized between the nodes in reciprocal space, while in the
nodeless phase, with its a full bulk gap, the zero-energy boundary flat band
spans the whole Brillouin zone.

<h3>Neutron-scattering signature of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in  nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<i>Evelyn Pratami Sinaga, Michael P. Adams, Eddwi H. Hasdeo, Andreas Michels</i>
<p>The antisymmetric Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction (DMI) arises in systems
with broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. In conjunction
with the isotropic and symmetric exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, the
dipolar interaction, and an externally applied magnetic field, the DMI supports
and stabilizes the formation of various kinds of complex mesoscale
magnetization configurations, such as helices, spin spirals, skyrmions, or
hopfions. A question of importance in this context addresses the
neutron-scattering signature of the DMI, in particular in nanoparticle
assemblies, where the related magnetic scattering signal is diffuse in
character and not of the single-crystal diffraction-peak-type, as it is e.g.\
seen in the B20 compounds. Using micromagnetic simulations we study the effect
of the DMI in spherical FeGe nanoparticles on the randomly-averaged magnetic
neutron scattering observables, more specifically on the spin-flip small-angle
neutron scattering cross section, the related chiral function, and the
pair-distance distribution function. Within the studied parameter space for the
particle size ($60 \, \mathrm{nm} \leq L \leq 200 \, \mathrm{nm}$) and the
applied magnetic field ($-1 \, \mathrm{T} \leq \mu_0 H_0 \leq 1 \,
\mathrm{T}$), we find that the chiral function is only nonzero when the DMI is
taken into account in the simulations. This result is discussed within the
context of the symmetry properties of the magnetization Fourier components and
of the involved energies under space inversion. Finally, for small applied
magnetic fields, we provide an easy-to-implement analytical correlation
function for the DMI-induced spin modulations (with wave vector
$k_{\mathrm{d}}$). The corresponding randomly-averaged spin-flip SANS cross
section reproduces the main features found in the numerical simulations.

<h3>Effect of the growth temperature and the AlN mole fraction on In  incorporation and properties of quaternary III-nitride layers grown by  molecular beam epitaxy</h3>

<p>Indium incorporation into wurtzite (0001)-oriented
In$_{x}$Al$_{y}$Ga$_{1-x-y}$N layers grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam
epitaxy was studied as a function of the growth temperature (565-635
$^{\circ}$C) and the AlN mole fraction (0.01 < y < 0.27). The layer
stoichiometry was determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS).
RBS shows that Indium incorporation decreased continuously with increasing
growth temperature due to thermally enhanced dissociation of In-N bonds and for
increasing AlN mole fractions. High resolution x-ray diffraction and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements did not show evidence of
phase separation. The mosaicity of the quaternary layers was found to be mainly
determined by the growth temperature and independent on alloy composition
within the range studied. However, depending on the AlN mole fraction,
nanometer-sized composition fluctuations were detected by TEM.
Photoluminescence spectra showed a single broad emission at room temperature,
with energy and bandwidth S- and W-shaped temperature dependences typical of
exciton localization by alloy inhomogeneities. Cathodo-luminescence
measurements demonstrated that the alloy inhomogeneities, responsible of
exciton localization, occur on a lateral length scale below 150 nm, which is
corroborated by TEM.

<p>Room temperature photoluminescence and optical absorption spectra have been
measured in wurtzite In$_{x}$Al$_{y}$Ga$_{1-x-y}$N (x $\approx$ 0.06, 0.02 < y
< 0.27) layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Photoluminescence spectra show
both an enhancement of the integrated intensity and an increasing Stokes shift
with the Al content. Both effects arise from an Al-enhanced exciton
localization revealed by the S- and W-shaped temperature dependences of the
photoluminescence emission energy and bandwidth respectively. Present results
point to these materials as a promising choice for the active region in
efficient light emitters. An In-related bowing parameter of 1.6 eV was derived
from optical absorption data.

<h3>High-temperature growth of GaN nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy:  toward the materials quality of bulk GaN</h3>

<i>J. K. Zettler, C. Hauswald, P. Corfdir, M. Musolino, L. Geelhaar, H. Riechert, O. Brandt, S. Fernández-Garrido</i>
<p>In molecular beam epitaxy, the spontaneous formation of GaN nanowires on
Si(111) substrates at elevated temperatures is limited by the long incubation
time that precedes nanowire nucleation. In this work, we present three
unconventional growth approaches to minimize the incubation time and thus
facilitate significantly higher growth temperatures (up to 875$^{\circ}$C). We
achieve this by: (i) using III/V flux ratios larger than one to compensate for
Ga desorption, (ii) introducing a two-step growth procedure, and (iii) using an
AlN buffer layer to favor GaN nucleation. The GaN nanowire ensembles grown at
so far unexplored substrate temperatures exhibit excitonic transitions with
sub-meV linewidths and the low-temperature photoluminescence spectra are
comparable to those of state-of-the-art free-standing GaN layers grown by
hydride vapor phase epitaxy.

<p>Spin-orbit torque can drive auto-oscillations of propagating spin wave (PSW)
modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). These modes
allow both long-range coupling and the potential of controlling its phase --
critical aspect for nano-magnonics, spin wave logic, and Ising machines. Here,
we demonstrate PSW-driven variable-phase coupling between two nano-constriction
SHNOs and study how their separation and the PSW wave vector impact their
mutual synchronization. In addition to ordinary in-phase mutual
synchronization, we observe, using both electrical measurements and
phase-resolved $\mu-$Brillouin Light Scattering microscopy, mutual
synchronization with a phase that can be tuned from 0 to $\pi$ using the drive
current or the applied field. Micromagnetic simulations corroborate the
experiments and visualize how the PSW patterns in the bridge connecting the two
nano-constrictions govern the coupling. These results advance the capabilities
of mutually synchronized SHNOs and open up new possibilities for applications
in spin wave logic, unconventional computing, and Ising Machines.

remarkable properties. We center our discussion around its electronic
characteristics and their applications. We begin by giving a simple electronic
model which will then allow us to discuss its conductivity, electronic mobility
and the peculiar situation we find at the Fermi level. We then move to the
limitations imposed by the electronic structure, notably, the absence of a gap
in the band. Finally, we take a look at a very active research area:
modifications of the band structure of graphene and its potential applications.

<h3>Tensile and compressive strain tuning of a Kondo lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>Soumendra Nath Panja, Anton Jesche, Nan Tang, Philipp Gegenwart</i>
<p>We present electrical resistivity measurements on the prototypical
heavy-fermion metal YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ (YRS) under $a$-axis tensile and
compressive strain and focus on the evolution of the resistivity maximum near
136~K that arises from the interplay of the Kondo effect and the crystal
electric field (CEF) splitting. While compressive strain reduces $T_{\rm max}$,
similar as previously reported for hydrostatic pressure, $T_{\rm max}$ is
enhanced up to 145~K for 0.13\% tensile strain. Model calculations for the
strain effect on CEF splitting in YRS reveal a negligible shift of the levels.
Instead, the enhancement of the resistivity maximum indicates a 20\% increase
of the Kondo temperature. This opens the perspective to access the hidden
zero-field QCP in pure YRS.

<h3>Theory of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00643</a>

<i>Yukio Tanaka, Shun Tamura, Jorge Cayao</i>
<p>Majorana fermions are spin-1/2 neutral particles that are their own
antiparticles and were initially predicted by Ettore Majorana in particle
physics but their observation still remains elusive. The concept of Majorana
fermions has been borrowed into condensed matter physics, where, unlike
particle physics, Majorana fermions emerge as zero-energy quasiparticles that
can be engineered by combining electrons and holes and have therefore been
coined Majorana zero modes. In this review, we provide a pedagogical
explanation of the basic properties of Majorana zero modes in unconventional
superconductors and their consequences in experimental observables, putting a
special emphasis on the initial theoretical discoveries. In particular, we
first show that Majorana zero modes are self-conjugated and emerge as a special
type of zero energy surface Andreev bound states at the boundary of
unconventional superconductors. We then explore Majorana zero modes in
one-dimensional spin-polarized $p$-wave superconductors, where we address the
formation of topological superconductivity and the physical realization in
superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this part we highlight that Majorana
quasiparticles appear as zero-energy edge states, exhibiting charge neutrality,
spin-polarized, and spatial nonlocality as unique properties that can be
already seen from their energies and wavefunctions. Next, we discuss
analytically obtained Green's functions of $p$-wave superconductors and
demonstrate that the emergence of Majorana zero modes is always accompanied by
the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing as a unique result of the
self-conjugate nature of Majorana zero modes. We finally address the signatures
of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy, including the anomalous
proximity effect, and the phase-biased Josephson effect.

<p>We create two molecular devices with superconducting junctions, using
nickelocene molecules, single Fe atoms, and Pb electrodes at low temperature.
We find contrasting behavior based on the coordination of the Fe atom: one
device shows low-bias features in its differential conductance due to the
superposition of multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) and Fe-induced in-gap
states. The other reveals interference between MAR and in-gap states,
showcasing the diversity achievable in atomically engineered devices with
identical components.

<h3>The spectral boundary of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP)  -- free fermions, Bethe ansatz and random matrix theory</h3>

<br>
<i>Goran Nakerst, Tomaž Prosen, Masudul Haque</i>
<p>In non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion
Process (ASEP) serves as a paradigmatic example. We investigate the spectral
characteristics of the ASEP, focusing on the spectral boundary of its generator
matrix. We examine finite ASEP chains of length $L$, under periodic (pbc) and
open boundary conditions (obc). Notably, the spectral boundary exhibits $L$
spikes for pbc and $L+1$ spikes for obc. Treating the ASEP generator as an
interacting non-Hermitian fermionic model, we extend the model to have tunable
interaction. In the non-interacting case, the analytically computed many-body
spectrum shows a spectral boundary with prominent spikes. For pbc, we use the
coordinate Bethe ansatz to interpolate between the noninteracting case to the
ASEP limit, and show that these spikes stem from clustering of Bethe roots. The
robustness of the spikes in the spectral boundary is demonstrated by linking
the ASEP generator to random matrices with trace correlations or, equivalently,
random graphs with distinct cycle structures, both displaying similar spiked
spectral boundaries.

<h3>In-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance in detwinned  $BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}$ ($x$ = 0, 0.6)</h3>

<i>Kelly J. Neubauer, Mason L. Klemm, Shirin Mozaffari, Lin Jiao, Alexei E. Koshelev, Alexander Yaresko, Ming Yi, Luis Balicas, Pengcheng Dai</i>
<p>Understanding the magnetoresistance (MR) of a magnetic material forms the
basis for uncovering the orbital mechanisms and charge-spin interactions in the
system. Although the parent state of iron-based high-temperature
superconductors, including $BaFe_2As_2$, exhibits unusual electron transport
properties resulting from spin and charge correlations, there is still valuable
insight to be gained by understanding the in-plane MR effect due to twin
domains in the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic (AF) ordered state. Here, we
study the in-plane magnetoresistance anisotropy in detwinned $BaFe_2As_2$ and
compare the results to the non-magnetic Ni-doped sample. We find that in the
antiferromagnetically ordered state, $BaFe_2As_2$ exhibits anisotropic MR that
becomes large at low temperatures and high fields. Both transverse and
longitudinal MRs are highly anisotropic and dependent on the field and current
orientations. These results cannot be fully explained by calculations
considering only the anisotropic Fermi surface. Instead, the spin orientation
of the ordered moment also affects the MR effect, suggesting the presence of a
large charge-spin interaction in $BaFe_2As_2$ that is not present in the
Ni-doped material.

<h3>ScN/GaN($1\bar{1}00$): a new platform for the epitaxy of twin-free  metal-semiconductor heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<i>Philipp John, Achim Trampert, Duc Van Dinh, Domenik Spallek, Jonas Lähnemann, Vladimir Kaganer, Lutz Geelhaar, Oliver Brandt, Thomas Auzelle</i>
<p>We study the molecular beam epitaxy of rock-salt ScN on the wurtzite
GaN($1\bar{1}00$) surface. To this end, ScN is grown on free-standing
GaN($1\bar{1}00$) substrates and self-assembled GaN nanowires that exhibit
($1\bar{1}00$) sidewalls. On both substrates, ScN crystallizes twin-free thanks
to a specific epitaxial relationship, namely
ScN(110)[001]$||$GaN($1\bar{1}00$)[0001], providing a congruent, low-symmetry
GaN/ScN interface. The 13.1 % uniaxial lattice mismatch occurring in this
orientation mostly relaxes within the first few monolayers of growth by forming
a coincidence site lattice, where 7 GaN planes coincide with 8 ScN planes,
leaving the ScN surface nearly free of extended defects. Overgrowth of the ScN
with GaN leads to a kinetic stabilization of the zinc blende phase, that
rapidly develops wurtzite inclusions nucleating on {111} nanofacets, commonly
observed during zinc blende GaN growth. Our ScN/GaN($1\bar{1}00$) platform
opens a new route for the epitaxy of twin-free metal-semiconductor
heterostructures made of closely lattice-matched GaN, ScN, HfN and ZrN
compounds.

<i>Luca Leoni, Cesare Franchini</i>
<p>Normalizing Flows (NF) are powerful generative models with increasing
applications in augmenting Monte Carlo algorithms due to their high flexibility
and expressiveness. In this work we explore the integration of NF in
Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DMC), presenting an architecture designed to sample
the intricate multidimensional space of Feynman''s diagrams through
dimensionality reduction. By decoupling the sampling of diagram order and
interaction times, the flow focuses on one interaction at a time. This enables
constructing a general diagram by employing the same unsupervised model
iteratively, dressing a zero-order diagram with interactions determined by the
previously sampled order. The resulting NF-augmented DMC is tested on the
widely used single-site Holstein polaron model in the entire electron-phonon
coupling regime. The obtained data show that the model accurately reproduces
the diagram distribution reducing sample correlation and statistical error for
observables such as the polaron binding energy and the interacting Green's
function.

<p>Resistive switching is the fundamental process that triggers the sudden
change of the electrical properties in solid-state devices under the action of
intense electric fields. Despite its relevance for information processing,
ultrafast electronics, neuromorphic devices, resistive memories and
brain-inspired computation, the nature of the local stochastic fluctuations
that drive the formation of metallic nuclei out of the insulating state has
remained hidden. Here, using operando X-ray nano-imaging, we have captured the
early-stages of resistive switching in a V2O3-based device under working
conditions. V2O3 is a paradigmatic Mott material, which undergoes a first-order
metal-to-insulator transition coupled to a lattice transformation that breaks
the threefold rotational symmetry of the rhombohedral metal phase. We reveal a
new class of volatile electronic switching triggered by nanoscale topological
defects of the lattice order parameter of the insulating phase. Our results
pave the way to the use of strain engineering approaches to manipulate
topological defects and achieve the full control of the electronic Mott
switching. The concept of topology-driven reversible electronic transition is
of interest for a broad class of quantum materials, comprising transition metal
oxides, chalcogenides and kagome metals, that exhibit first-order electronic
transitions coupled to a symmetry-breaking order.

<h3>Field direction dependence of the electrocaloric effect in single  crystal BaTiO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<i>Lan-Tien Hsu, Frank Wendler, Anna Grünebohm</i>
<p>Single crystalline ferroelectric perovskites show a large electrocaloric
effect (ECE) at field-induced phase transitions, raising attention to
solid-state cooling technology. However, paraelectric-ferroelectric transition
temperatures are often too high for practical applications and lower
transitions are so far underrepresented in literature. Particularly, the role
of thermal hysteresis and field direction on the responses is critical, but not
yet fully understood. Using ab initio based coarse-grained molecular dynamics,
we show that the polarization changes at zero fields are good descriptors for
the field direction dependence of transition temperatures both for BaTiO$_3$
and PbTiO$_3$ even though both materials show different microscopic field
coupling. Furthermore, we reveal that the choice of field direction can reduce
irreversibilities related to thermal hysteresis and can adjust the temperature
windows of large caloric responses. Based on our results we identify favorable
temperature- and texturing conditions for polycrystals.

<h3>Element-specific and high-bandwidth ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy  with a coherent, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source</h3>

<br>
<i>Michael Tanksalvala, Anthony Kos, Jacob Wisser, Scott Diddams, Hans T. Nembach, Justin M. Shaw</i>
<p>We developed and applied a tabletop, ultrafast, high-harmonic generation
(HHG) source to measure the element-specific ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in
ultra-thin magnetic alloys and multilayers on an opaque Si substrate. We
demonstrate a continuous wave bandwidth of 62 GHz, with promise to extend to
100 GHz or higher. This laboratory-scale instrument detects the FMR using
ultrafast, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, with photon energies spanning the
M-edges of most relevant magnetic elements. An RF frequency comb generator is
used to produce a microwave excitation that is intrinsically synchronized to
the EUV pulses with a timing jitter of 1.4 ps or better. We apply this system
to measure the dynamics in a multilayer system as well as Ni-Fe and Co-Fe
alloys. Since this instrument operates in reflection-mode, it is a milestone
toward measuring and imaging the dynamics of the magnetic state and spin
transport of active devices on arbitrary and opaque substrates. The higher
bandwidth also enables measurements of materials with high magnetic anisotropy,
as well as ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and short-wavelength (high
wavevector) spinwaves in nanostructures or nanodevices. Furthermore, the
coherence and short wavelength of the EUV will enable extending these studies
using dynamic nanoscale lensless imaging techniques such as coherent
diffractive imaging, ptychography, and holography.

<br>
<i>Eliana Fiorelli</i>
<p>We consider a class of open quantum many-body systems that evolves in a
Markovian fashion, the dynamical generator being in GKS-Lindblad form. Here,
the Hamiltonian contribution is characterized by an all-to-all coupling, and
the dissipation features local transitions that depend on collective,
operator-valued rates, encoding average properties of the system. These types
of generators can be formally obtained by generalizing, to the quantum realm,
classical (mean-field) stochastic Markov dynamics, with state-dependent
transitions. Focusing on the dynamics emerging in the limit of infinitely large
systems, we build on the exactness of the mean-field equations for the dynamics
of average operators. In this framework, we derive the dynamics of quantum
fluctuation operators, that can be used in turn to understand the fate of
quantum correlations in the system. We apply our results to quantum generalized
Hopfield associative memories, showing that, asymptotically and at the
mesoscopic scale only a very weak amount of quantum correlations, in the form
of quantum discord, emerges beyond classical correlations.

making a wide comparison between different theoretical methods, including DFT,
DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory, and Hedin's $GW$ approximation,
we discover how the magnetic Compton profiles of Ni can be predicted remarkably
well. We find that the essential ingredients missing in DFT are (i) local spin

<i>Soumendu Bagchi, Danny Perez</i>
<p>The kinetics of dislocation reactions, such as dislocation multiplication,
controls the plastic deformation in crystals beyond their elastic limit,
therefore critical mechanisms in a number of applications in materials science.
We present a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that shows
that one such type of reactions, the nucleation of dislocation at free
surfaces, exhibit extremely unconventional kinetics, including unexpectedly
large nucleation rates under compression, very strong entropic stabilization
under tension, as well as strong non-Arrhenius behavior. These unusual kinetics
are quantitatively rationalized using a variational transition state theory
approach coupled with an efficient numerical scheme for the estimation of
vibrational entropy changes. These results highlight the need for a variational
treatment of the kinetics to quantitatively capture dislocation reaction
kinetics, especially at low-to-moderate strains where large deformations are
required to activate reactions. These observations suggest possible
explanations to previously observed unconventional deformation kinetics in both
molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.

<i>Debika Debnath, Paramita Dutta</i>
<p>We theoretically explore Josephson diode effect (JDE) in
superconductor/quantum dot (QD)/superconductor junctions in the presence of a
magnetic field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI). We calculate the
Josephson current in our QD junction using Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's
function technique. We show that RSOI can induce JDE in our junction without
any magnetic field. However, the rectification coefficient (RC) of our QD based
Josephson diode (JD) is amplified when both are present. Interestingly, the
sign and magnitude of the RC are highly controllable by the magnetic field and
RSOI. For realistic RSOI strength in the presence of magnetic field and
chirality, the RC can be tuned to be as high as $70\%$ by an external gate
potential, indicating a giant JDE in our QD junction. Our proposed QD based JD
may serve as a potential superconducting device component.

<h3>Role of filler lanthanide ions on lattice dynamics of phosphide  skutterudites RFe$_4$P$_{12}$ (R = La, Ce, and Pr) from first principles</h3>

<br>
<i>Rafaela F. S. Penacchio, Nicholas Burns, Maurício B. Estradiote, Milton S. Torikachvili, Stefan W. Kycia, Sérgio L. Morelhão</i>
<p>Phosphide skutterudites primarily show promise for thermoelectric
applications due to their chemical stability at high temperatures and
relatively low cost. Ion doping and band gap engineering have been used to
enhance their typically poor thermoelectric performance, opening avenues for
practical applications. Herein, we report a comparative lattice dynamics study
on the impact of filler and temperature on the structural and vibrational
properties of RFe$_4$P$_{12}$ (R = La, Ce, and Pr) skutterudites. Calculations
are performed within the quasi-harmonic approximation, and the results are
critically compared against experimental data and other \textit{ab initio}
calculations. We found gaps between the heat-carrying acoustic and optical
modes, a-o gaps, of approximately 4, -2, and 0.01\,cm$^{-1}$ for La, Ce, and Pr
compounds, respectively. These results suggest a filler-induced reduction in
the a-o gap is attributed to the softening of the optical modes instead of the
conventionally considered upward shift of acoustic modes proposed in the
\textit{rattling} scenario. The distinct softening of the optical modes is
rationalized by the stiffening of chemical bonds between the filler and host
lattice.

<h3>Unveiling nonequilibrium from multifilar events</h3>

<br>
<i>Pedro E. Harunari</i>
<p>Closely related to the laws of thermodynamics, the detection and
quantification of disequilibria are crucial in unraveling the complexities of
nature, particularly those beneath observable layers. Theoretical developments
in nonequilibrium thermodynamics employ coarse-graining methods to consider a
diversity of partial information scenarios that mimic experimental limitations,
allowing the inference of properties such as the entropy production rate. A
ubiquitous but rather unexplored scenario involves observing events that can
possibly arise from many transitions in the underlying Markov process--which we
dub $\textit{multifilar events}$--as in the cases of exchanges measured at
particle reservoirs, hidden Markov models, mixed chemical and mechanical
transformations in biological function, composite systems, and more. We relax
one of the main assumptions in a previously developed framework, based on
first-passage problems, to assess the non-Markovian statistics of mutifilar
events. By using the asymmetry of event distributions and their waiting-times,
we put forward model-free tools to detect nonequilibrium behavior and estimate
entropy production, while discussing their suitability for different classes of
systems and regimes where they provide no new information, evidence of
nonequilibrium, a lower bound for entropy production, or even its exact value.
The results are illustrated in reference models through analytics and numerics.

<h3>Energetic comparison of exciton gas versus electron-hole plasma in a  bilayer two-dimensional electron-hole system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00866</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ting Tu, Seth M. Davis, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>We study the zero-temperature phase diagram of a symmetric electron-hole
bilayer system by comparing the ground state energies of two distinct limiting
cases, characterized by an electron-hole plasma or an exciton gas,
respectively. For the electron-hole plasma, the random phase approximation is
used; for the exciton gas, we consider three different approximations: the
unscreened Coulomb interaction, the statically screened one, and the
dynamically screened one under the plasmon-pole approximation. Our results
suggest that the exciton gas is stable at small layer separation. However,
static screening in general suppresses the formation of excitons, and dynamic
screening gives different results depending on the representative energy scale
we used in the plasmon-pole approximation. We conclude that energetic
considerations alone are very sensitive to the approximation schemes, and the
phase diagram of the system may depend crucially on exactly how the
electron-hole attraction is treated in the theory. For very small and very
large densities, however, all our approximations show the exciton gas to have
lower energy than the plasma.

<h3>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</h3>

<p>We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm
A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion
($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a nematic superconductor in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in
the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region
of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically
lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical
Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley
anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening
near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's
coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon
atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that
the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing
(negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$,
albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative
and based on $exact$ asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by
Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is
predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the
parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic
$d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal
structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction). A
fully gapped $s$-wave pairing is also possible but spans a smaller phase space
in the phase diagram.
