<h3>Riemann meets Goldstone: magnon scattering off quantum Hall skyrmion  crystals probes interplay of symmetry breaking and topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13049</a>
<br>
<i>Nilotpal Chakraborty, Roderich Moessner, Benoit Doucot</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a model to study magnon scattering in skyrmion crystals,
sandwiched between ferromagnets which act as the source of magnons. Skyrmions
are topological objects while skyrmion crystals break internal and
translational symmetries, thus our setup allows us to study the interplay of
topology and symmetry breaking. Starting from a basis of holomorphic theta
functions, we construct an analytical ansatz for such a junction with finite
spatially modulating topological charge density in the central region and
vanishing in the leads. We then construct a suitably defined energy functional
for the junction and derive the resulting equations of motion, which resemble a
Bogoliubov-de Gennes-like equation. Using analytical techniques, field theory,
heuristic models and microscopic recursive transfer-matrix numerics, we
calculate the spectra and magnon transmission properties of the skyrmion
crystal. We find that magnon transmission can be understood via a combination
of low-energy Goldstone modes and effective emergent Landau levels at higher
energies. The former manifests in discrete low-energy peaks in the transmission
spectrum which reflect the nature of the Goldstone modes arising from symmetry
breaking. The latter, which reflect the topology, lead to band-like
transmission features, from the structure of which further details of the
excitation spectrum of the skyrmion crystal can be inferred. Such
characteristic transmission features are absent in competing phases of the
quantum Hall phase diagram, and hence provide direct signatures of skyrmion
crystal phases and their spectra. Our results directly apply to quantum Hall
heterojunction experiments in monolayer graphene with the central region doped
slightly away from unit filling, a $\nu = 1:1 \pm \delta \nu: 1$ junction and
are also relevant to junctions formed by metallic magnets or in junctions with
artificial gauge fields.

<h3>Spin-polarons and ferromagnetism in doped dilute Wigner-Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13068" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13068</a>

<i>Urban F. P. Seifert, Leon Balents</i>
<br>
<br>
Moir\'e heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit
Mott-insulating behaviour both at half-filling as well as at fractional
fillings, where electronic degrees of freedom form self-organized Wigner
crystal states. An open question concerns magnetic states obtained by lifting
the pseudospin-1/2 degeneracy of these states at lowest temperatures. While at
half-filling virtual hopping is expected to induce (weak) antiferromagnetic
exchange interactions, these are strongly suppressed when considering
$\textit{dilute}$ filling fractions. We argue that instead a small
concentration of doped electrons leads to the formation of spin-polarons,
inducing ferromagnetic order at experimentally relevant temperatures. We
predict explicit signatures of polaron-formation in the magnetization profile
of the system.

<h3>Regularized lattice theory for spatially dispersive nonlinear optical  conductivities</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear optical responses are becoming increasingly relevant for
characterizing the symmetries and quantum geometry of electronic phases in
materials. Here, we develop an expanded diagrammatic scheme for calculating
spatially dispersive corrections to nonlinear optical conductivities, which we
expect to enhance or even dominate even-order responses in materials of recent
interest. Building upon previous work that enforces gauge invariance of
spatially uniform nonlinear optical responses, we review the cancellation of
diagrams required to ensure the equivalence between velocity gauge and length
gauge formulations, and provide a simple vertex rule for extending optical
responses to first order in the light wave vector q. We then demonstrate the
method with calculations on a prototypical centrosymmetric model where spatial
dispersion admits anomalous secondharmonic generation, a response that is
symmetry-forbidden under the dipole approximation.

<h3>On the redundancy in large material datasets: efficient and robust  learning with less data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13076</a>
<br>
<i>Kangming Li, Daniel Persaud, Kamal Choudhary, Brian DeCost, Michael Greenwood, Jason Hattrick-Simpers</i>
<br>
<br>
Extensive efforts to gather materials data have largely overlooked potential
data redundancy. In this study, we present evidence of a significant degree of
redundancy across multiple large datasets for various material properties, by
revealing that up to 95 % of data can be safely removed from machine learning
training with little impact on in-distribution prediction performance. The
redundant data is related to over-represented material types and does not
mitigate the severe performance degradation on out-of-distribution samples. In
addition, we show that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms can
construct much smaller but equally informative datasets. We discuss the
effectiveness of informative data in improving prediction performance and
robustness and provide insights into efficient data acquisition and machine
learning training. This work challenges the "bigger is better" mentality and
calls for attention to the information richness of materials data rather than a
narrow emphasis on data volume.

<h3>Metallic-insulator phase transitions in the extended Harper model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13078" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13078</a>
<br>
<i>João Chakrian, Marcelo L. Lyra, Jonas R. F. Lima</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we investigate the transport properties of non-relativistic
quantum particles on incommensurate multilayered structures with the
thicknesses $w_n$ of the layers following an extended Harper model given by
$w_n = w_0 |\cos(\pi a n^{\nu})|$. For the normal incidence case, which means
an one-dimensional system, we obtained that for a specific range of energy, it
is possible to see a metallic-insulator transition with the exponent $\nu$. A
metallic phase is supported for $\nu<1$. We also obtained that for the specific
value $\nu=1$ there is an alternation between metallic and insulator phases as
we change the disorder strength $w_0$. When we integrate out all incidence
angles, which means a two-dimensional system, the metallic-insulator transition
can be seen for much larger range of energy compared to the normal incidence
case.

<h3>Quasi-static deformation of yield stress materials: homogeneous or  localized?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13082</a>
<br>
<i>E. A. Jagla</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze a mesoscopic model of a shear stress material with a three
dimensional slab geometry, under an external quasistatic deformation of a
simple shear type. Relaxation is introduced in the model as a mechanism by
which an unperturbed system achieves progressively mechanically more stable
configurations. Although in all cases deformation occurs via localized plastic
events (avalanches) we find qualitatively different behavior depending on the
degree of relaxation in the model. For no or low relaxation yielding is
homogeneous in the sample, and even the largest avalanches become negligible in
size compared with the system size (measured as the thickness of the slab
$L_z$) when this is increased. On the contrary, for high relaxation the
deformation localizes in an almost two dimensional region where all avalanches
occur. Scaling analysis of the numerical results indicates that in this case
the linear size of the largest avalanches is comparable with $L_z$ even when
this becomes very large. We correlate the two scenarios with a qualitative
difference in the flow curve of the system in the two cases, which is
monotonous in the first case, or of the velocity weakening type in the second
case.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo study of a bilayer $U(2)\times U(2)$ symmetric  Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13083</a>
<br>
<i>Yosef Caplan, Dror Orgad</i>
<br>
<br>
We carry out a sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo calculation of a bilayer
model with a repulsive intra-layer Hubbard interaction and a ferromagnetic
inter-layer interaction. The latter breaks the global $SU(2)$ spin rotational
symmetry but preserves a $U(2)\times U(2)$ invariance under mixing of same-spin
electrons between layers. We show that despite the difference in symmetry, the
bilayer model exhibits the same qualitative features found in the single-layer
Hubbard model. These include stripe phases, whose nature is sensitive to the
presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, a maximum in the Knight shift that
moves to lower temperatures with increasing hole doping, and lack of evidence
for intra-layer $d$-wave superconductivity. Instead, we find a superconducting
phase whose critical temperature traces a dome as a function of doping and is
due to inter-layer spin-polarized pairing that is induced by the ferromagnetic
interaction.

<h3>Hybrid nodal line semimetal states in anisotropic lattice materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Understanding the role of lattice geometry in shaping topological states and
their properties is of fundamental importance to condensed matter and device
physics. Here we demonstrate how an anisotropic crystal lattice drives a
topological hybrid nodal line in transition metal tetraphosphides $Tm$P$_4$
($Tm$ = Transition metal). $Tm$P$_4$ constitutes a unique class of black
phosphorus materials formed by intercalating transition metal ions between the
phosphorus layers without destroying the characteristic anisotropic band
structure of the black phosphorous. Based on the first-principles calculations
and $k \cdot p$ theory, we show that $Tm$P$_4$ harbor a single hybrid nodal
line formed between oppositely-oriented anisotropic $Tm~d$ and P states
unhinged from the high-symmetry planes. The nodal line consists of both type-I
and type-II nodal band crossings whose nature and location are determined by
the effective-mass anisotropies of the intersecting bands. We further discuss a
possible topological phase transition to exemplify the formation of the hybrid
nodal line state in $Tm$P$_4$. Our results offer a comprehensive study for
understanding the interplay between structural motifs-driven mass anisotropies
and topology in anisotropic lattice materials to realize hybrid semimetal
states.

<h3>Vortex dynamics induced by scanning SQUID susceptometry</h3>

We measured the local magnetic response of a niobium thin film by applying a
millitesla-scale AC magnetic field using a micron-scale field coil and
detecting the response with a micron-scale pickup loop in a scanning
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) susceptometry measurement.
Near the film's critical temperature, we observed a step-like nonlinear and
dissipative magnetic response due to the dynamics of a small number of
vortex-antivortex pairs induced in the film by the local applied AC field. We
modeled the dynamics of the measurement using a combined two-dimensional
London-Maxwell and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach, allowing us to
construct a detailed real-space picture of the vortex motion causing the
observed dissipative response. This work pushes scanning SQUID susceptometry of
two-dimensional superconductors beyond the regime of linear response and lays
the foundation for microscopic studies of vortex dynamics and pinning in
superconducting devices and more exotic materials systems.

<h3>Spin-liquid-like state in a square lattice antiferromagnet</h3>

Collective behavior of spins, frustration-induced strong quantum fluctuations
and subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom in quantum materials
can lead to correlated quantum states with fractional excitations that are
essential ingredients for establishing paradigmatic models and have immense
potential for quantum technologies. Quenched randomness is a new paradigm in
elucidating the emergence of spin-liquidlike states in geometrically frustrated
magnets. Herein, we report magnetization, specific heat, electron spin
resonance, and muon spin resonance studies on a 3d-electron-based square
lattice antiferromagnet Sr3CuTa2O9. In this material, S = 1/2 Cu2+
nearest-neighbor ions constitute a two-dimensional square lattice. The negative
value of Curie-Weiss temperature, obtained from the Curie-Weiss fit of
high-temperature magnetic susceptibility data indicates the presence of
antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments. Specific heat data show the
absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 64 mK despite a reasonably
strong exchange interaction between Cu2+ spins as reflected from a Curie-Weiss
temperature of -27 K. The power-law behavior and the data collapse of specific
heat and magnetization data evince the emergence of a random-singlet state in
Sr3CuTa2O9. The power-law-like spin auto-correlation function and the data
collapse of muon polarization asymmetry with longitudinal field dependence of
t/({\mu}0H){\gamma} further support credence to the presence of a
randomness-induced liquid-like state. Our results suggest that randomness
induced by disorder is a viable route to realize quantum spin liquid-like state
in this square lattice antiferromagnet.

<h3>Response to polarization and weak topology in Chern insulators</h3>

Chern insulators present a topological obstruction to a smooth gauge in their
Bloch wave functions that prevents the construction of exponentially-localized
Wannier functions - this makes the electric polarization ill-defined. Here, we
show that spatial or temporal differences in polarization within Chern
insulators are well-defined and physically meaningful because they account for
bound charges and adiabatic currents. We further show that the difference in
polarization across Chern-insulator regions can be quantized in the presence of
crystalline symmetries, leading to "weak" symmetry-protected topological
phases. These phases exhibit charge fractional quantization at the edge and
corner interfaces and with concomitant topological states. We also generalize
our findings to quantum spin-Hall insulators and 3D topological insulators. Our
work settles a long-standing question and deems the bulk polarization as the
fundamental quantity with a "bulk-boundary correspondence", regardless of
whether a Wannier representation is possible.

<h3>Estimating the master stability function from the time series of one  oscillator via machine learning</h3>

The master stability function (MSF) yields the stability of the globally
synchronized state of a network of identical oscillators in terms of the
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In order to compute the MSF, one must have
an accurate model of an uncoupled oscillator, but often such a model does not
exist. We present a machine learning technique for estimating the MSF given
only the time series of a single, uncoupled oscillator. We demonstrate the
generality of our technique by considering a variety of coupling configurations
of networks consisting of Lorenz oscillators or H{\'e}non maps.

<h3>Breaking the H2 chemical bond in a crystalline environment</h3>

Through density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations, we
have analysed various metal polyhydrides to understand whether hydrogen is
present in its molecular or atomic form - tetrahydrides of Ba,Sr,Ra, Cs and La;
Ba$_8$H$_{46}$ and BaH$_{12}$.
We show that, in experimentally reported binary barium hydrides (BaH$_x$),
molecular H$_2$ and atomic H$^-$ can coexist with the metallic cations.
In this thorough study of differences between BaH$_4$, higher barium
hydrides, and other binary tetrahydrides we find the number of atomic hydrogens
is equal to the formal charge of the cations. The remaining hydrogen forms
molecules in proportions yielding, e.g. BaH$_2$(H$_2)_x$, at pressures as high
as 200 GPa. At room temperature these are highly dynamic structures with the
hydrogens switching between H$^-$ and H$_2$ while retaining the 2:x ratio.
We find some qualitative differences between our static DFT calculations and
previously reported structural and spectroscopic experimental results. Two
factors allow us to resolve such discrepancies: Firstly, in static relaxation
H$_2$ must be regarded as a non-spherical object, which breaks symmetry in a
way invisible to X-rays; Secondly the required number of molecules $x$ may be
incompatible with the experimental space group (e.g. $BaH_2(H_2)_5$). In
molecular dynamics, bond-breaking transitions between various structural
symmetry configurations happen on a picosecond timescale via an H$_3^-$
intermediate. Rebonding is slow enough to allow a spectroscopic signal but
frequent enough to average out over the lengthscale involved in diffraction.

<h3>Optically induced symmetry breaking due to nonequilibrium steady state  formation in charge density wave material 1T-TiSe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13170</a>
<br>
<i>Harshvardhan Jog, Luminita Harnagea, Dibyata Rout, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Eugene J. Mele, Ritesh Agarwal</i>
<br>
<br>
The strongly correlated charge density wave (CDW) phase of 1T-TiSe$_2$ is
being extensively researched to verify the claims of a unique chiral order due
to the presence of three equivalent Fermi wavevectors involved in the CDW
formation. Characterization of the symmetries is therefore critical to
understand the origin of their intriguing properties but can be complicated by
the coupling of the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Here we use
continuous wave laser excitation to probe the symmetries of TiSe$_2$ using the
circular photogalvanic effect with very high sensitivity. We observe that the
ground state of the CDW phase is achiral. However, laser excitation above a
threshold intensity transforms TiSe$_2$ into a chiral phase in a nonequilibrium
steady state, which changes the electronic correlations in the stacking
direction of the layered material. The inherent sensitivity of the
photogalvanic technique provides clear evidence of the different optically
driven phases of 1T-TiSe$_2$, as well as emphasizes the interplay of electronic
and lattice degrees of freedom in this system under optical excitation. Our
work demonstrates that optically induced phase change can occur at extremely
low optical intensities in strongly correlated materials, providing a pathway
for future studies to engineer new phases using light.

<h3>Tensor network variational optimizations for real-time dynamics:  application to the time-evolution of spin liquids</h3>

Within the Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) tensor network formalism, a
simple update (SU) method has been used to investigate the time evolution of a
two-dimensional U(1) critical spin-1/2 spin liquid under Hamiltonian quench
[Phys. Rev. B 106, 195132 (2022)]. Here we introduce two different variational
frameworks to describe the time dynamics of SU(2)-symmetric
translationally-invariant PEPS, aiming to improve the accuracy. In one
approach, after using a Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the time evolution
operator in term of two-site elementary gates, one considers a single bond
embedded in an environment approximated by a Corner Transfer Matrix
Renormalization Group (CTMRG). A variational update of the two tensors on the
bond is performed under the application of the elementary gate and then, after
symmetrization of the site tensors, the environment is updated. In the second
approach, a cluster optimization is performed on a finite (periodic) cluster,
maximizing the overlap of the exact time-evolved state with a symmetric
finite-size PEPS ansatz. Observables are then computed on the infinite lattice
contracting the infinite-PEPS (iPEPS) by CTMRG. We show that the variational
schemes outperform the SU method and remain accurate over a significant time
interval before hitting the entanglement barrier. Studying the spectrum of the
transfer matrix, we found that the asymptotic correlations are very well
preserved under time evolution, including the critical nature of the singlet
correlations, as expected from the Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound theorem. We also
compute the time-evolution of the short distance spin-spin correlations and
estimate the LR velocity.

<h3>Thermal and optical conductivity in the Holstein model at half-filling  and at finite temperatures in the Luttinger-liquid and charge-density-wave  regime</h3>

<br>
Electron-phonon interactions play a key role in many branches of solid-state
physics. Here, our focus is on the transport properties of one-dimensional
systems, and we apply efficient real-time matrix-product state methods to
compute the optical and thermal conductivities of Holstein chains at finite
temperatures and filling. We validate our approach by comparison with
analytical results applicable to single polarons valid in the small polaron
limit. Our work provides a systematic study of contributions to the thermal
conductivity at finite frequencies and elucidates differences in the spectrum
compared to the optical conductivity, covering both the Luttinger-liquid and
charge-density-wave regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is
capable of extracting the DC conductivities as well. Beyond this first
application, several future extensions seem feasible, such as, the inclusion of
dispersive phonons, different types of local electron-phonon coupling, and a
systematic study of drag effects in this electron-phonon coupled system.

<h3>Exploring the origins of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in amorphous  Tb-Co via changes in medium-range ordering</h3>

<br>
Amorphous thin films of Tb$_{17}$Co$_{83}$ (a-Tb-Co) grown by magnetron
co-sputtering exhibit changes in magnetic anisotropy with varying growth and
annealing temperatures. The magnetic anisotropy constant increases with
increasing growth temperature, which is reduced or vanishes upon annealing at
temperatures above the growth temperature. The proposed explanation for this
growth-induced anisotropy in high orbital moment Tb-based transition metal
alloys such as a-Tb-Co is an amorphous phase texturing with preferential
in-plane and out-of-plane local bonding configurations for the rare-earth and
transition metal atoms. Scanning nanodiffraction performed in a transmission
electron microscope (TEM) is applied to a-Tb$_{17}$Co$_{83}$ films deposited
over a range of temperatures to measure relative changes in medium-range
ordering (MRO). These measurements reveal an increase in MRO with higher growth
temperatures and a decrease in MRO with higher annealing temperatures. The
trend in MRO indicates a relationship between the magnetic anisotropy and local
atomic ordering. Tilting select films between 0$^{\circ}$ and 40$^{\circ}$ in
the TEM measures variations in the local atomic structure a function of
orientation within the films. The findings support claims that preferential
ordering along the growth direction results from temperature-mediated adatom
configurations during deposition, and that oriented MRO correlates with the
larger anisotropy constants.

<h3>An rf Quantum Capacitance Parametric Amplifier</h3>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a radio-frequency parametric amplifier that exploits the
gate-tunable quantum capacitance of an ultra high mobility two dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) in a GaAs heterostructure at cryogenic temperatures. The
prototype narrowband amplifier exhibits a gain greater than 20 dB up to an
input power of - 66 dBm (1 dB compression), and a noise temperature TN of 1.3 K
at 370 MHz. In contrast to superconducting amplifiers, the quantum capacitance
parametric amplifier (QCPA) is operable at tesla-scale magnetic fields and
temperatures ranging from milli kelvin to a few kelvin. These attributes,
together with its low power (microwatt) operation when compared to conventional
transistor amplifiers, suggest the QCPA may find utility in enabling on-chip
integrated readout circuits for semiconductor qubits or in the context of space
transceivers and radio astronomy instruments.

<h3>Anyon Quantum Dimensions from an Arbitrary Ground State Wave Function</h3>

Topological orders and anyons are fascinating phenomena that are both
conceptually important and practically useful for quantum computing. However,
topological orders lack conventional order parameters and are generically
difficult to diagnose. Recent advances in quantum simulations have further
emphasized the need for efficient methods for identifying topological orders. A
breakthrough in this problem is the discovery of topological entanglement
entropy, which can be used to detect nontrivial topological order from a ground
state wave function, but is far from enough for fully determining the
topological order. In this work, we take a key step further in this direction:
We propose a simple entanglement-based protocol for extracting the quantum
dimensions of all anyons from a single ground state wave function in two
dimensions. The choice of the space manifold and the ground state is arbitrary.
This protocol is first validated in the continuum using Chern-Simons field
theories, and then analytically verified on lattices using Kitaev's quantum
double models. We anticipate that our protocol can be implemented
experimentally in various quantum simulation platforms, as well as in numerics.

The Kitaev model, a honeycomb network of spins with bond-dependent
anisotropic interactions, is a rare example of having a quantum spin liquid
ground state. Although most Kitaev model candidate materials eventually order
magnetically due to inevitable non-Kitaev terms, their bond-dependent
anisotropy manifests in unusual spin dynamics. It has recently been suggested
that bond-dependent anisotropy can stabilise novel magnetic phases and exotic
spin dynamics on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. However, few
materials have been identified with simultaneous geometric frustration and
bond-dependent anisotropy. Here, we report a frustrated triangular lattice with
bond-dependent anisotropy in the cobalt-based triangular van der Waals
antiferromagnet CoI2. Its momentum and energy-resolved spin dynamics exhibit
substantial magnon breakdown and complex level repulsion, as measured by
inelastic neutron scattering. A thorough examination of excitations in both the
paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states reveals that the bond-dependent
anisotropy is the origin of the spiral order and the magnon breakdown found in
CoI2. Our result paves the way toward a new research direction for the Kitaev

<br>
Double-perovskite oxides have attracted recent attention due to their
attractive functionalities and application potential. In this paper, we
demonstrate the effect of dual controls, i.e., the deposition pressure of
oxygen (P$_O2$) and lattice mismatch ($\epsilon$), on tuning magnetic
properties in epitaxial double-perovskite Sr$_2$FeReO$_6$ films. In a
nearly-lattice-matched Sr$_2$FeReO$_6$/SrTiO$_3$ film, the
ferrimagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition occurs when P$_O2$ is reduced to
30 mTorr, probably due to the formation of Re$^{4+}$ ions that replace the
stoichiometric Re$^{5+}$ to cause disorders of $B$-site ions. On the other
hand, a large compressive strain or tensile strain shifts this critical P$_O2$
to below 1 mTorr or above 40 mTorr, respectively. The observations could be
attributed to the modulation of $B$-site ordering by epitaxial strain through
affecting elemental valence. Our results provide a feasible way to expand the
functional tunability of magnetic double-perovskite oxides that hold great
promise for spintronic devices.

Theoretical studies on spin-dependent transport through helical molecules
with straight spiral geometry have received intense research interest in the
past decade, however, the physics in circular helical molecules has still less
been explored. In this work, we theoretically construct a circular single helix
(CSH) possessing the chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling and contacting with
two non-magnetic electrodes. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the
spin-related transport in CSH exhibits the so-called chiral-induced spin
selectivity (CISS) effect and more importantly, the CISS-reduced spin-dependent
destructive quantum interference (DQI) also occurs in the CSH, without any
external magnetic field or magnetic electrodes. Moreover, the changing of CSH
length or the electrode positions exhibits specific patterns in the
spin-polarized conductance. Particularly, the dephasing magnitude can adjust
effectively these two spin-dependent effects to realize their coexistence.
Additionally, the phase transition between the CISS-dependent constructive
quantum interference (CQI) and DQI is also observed in the CSH. Our theoretical
work puts forwards a new material plateau to explore the CISS and to exhibit
the novel CISS-dependent CQI effect.

Ionic Seebeck effect has received increasing attention because of its
advantages such as high Seebeck coefficient and low cost. However, theoretical
study on the ionic Seebeck coefficient is still in its infancy and mainly
focuses on diluted simple electrolytes excluding the contributions of ion
steric effects and short-range electrostatic correlation. Here, we show that
the coupling of the steric effects due to finite ion sizes and ion
thermodiffusion in electric double layers can significantly enhance the
thermoelectric response in confined electrolytes via both theory and
simulation. The Seebeck coefficient can reach 100% or even one order of
magnitude enhancement as compared to previous theoretical models depending on
the degree of the ion steric effects and the sum of ion Soret coefficients. In
addition, we demonstrate that the short-range electrostatic correlation is
beneficial to achieving the maximum Seebeck coefficient at weaker confinement
or more concentrated electrolytes. These findings can provide a strategy for
achieving high Seebeck coefficient and high electric conductivity
simultaneously to improve the efficiency of the ionic thermoelectric
conversion.

Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), a ferromagnetic van der Waals topological nodal line
semimetal, has recently been studied. Using first-principles calculations and
symmetry analysis, we investigate the effect of a uniaxial tensile strain on
the nodal line and the resultant intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Our
results reveal their robustness to the in-plane strain. Moreover, the intrinsic
AHE remains robust even for artificial adjustment of the atomic positions
introduced to break the crystalline symmetries of FGT. When the spin-orbit
coupling is absent, the nodal line degeneracy remains intact as long as the
inversion symmetry or the two-fold screw symmetry is maintained, which reveal
that the nodal line may emerge much more easily than previously predicted. This
strong robustness is surprising and disagrees with the previous experimental
report [Y. Wang et al., Adv. Mater. 32, 2004533 (2020)], which reports that a
uniaxial strain of less than 1 % of the in-plane lattice constant can double
the anomalous Hall resistance. This discrepancy implies that the present
understanding of the AHE in FGT is incomplete. The possible origins of this
discrepancy are discussed.

On-surface metal porphyrins can undergo electronic and conformational changes
that play a crucial role in determining the chemical reactivity of the
molecular layer. Therefore, understanding those properties is pivotal for the
design and implementation of organic-based devices. Here, by means of
photoemission orbital tomography supported by density functional theory
calculations, we investigate the electronic and geometrical structure of two
metallated tetraphenyl porphyrins (MTPPs), namely ZnTPP and NiTPP, adsorbed on
the oxygen-passivated Fe(100)-p(1x1)O surface. Both molecules weakly interact
with the surface as no charge transfer is observed. In the case of ZnTPP our
data correspond to those of moderately distorted molecules, while NiTPP
exhibits a severe saddle-shape deformation. From additional experiments on
NiTPP multilayer films, we conclude that this distortion is a consequence of
the interaction with the substrate, as the NiTPP macrocycle of the second layer
turns out to be flat. We further find that distortions in the MTPP macrocycle
are accompanied by an increasing energy gap between the highest occupied
molecular orbitals (HOMO and HOMO-1). Our results demonstrate that
photoemission orbital tomography can simultaneously probe the energy level
alignment, the azimuthal orientation, and the adsorption geometry of complex
aromatic molecules even in the multilayer regime.

Continuous attractor neural networks (CANN) form an appealing conceptual
model for the storage of information in the brain. However a drawback of CANN
is that they require finely tuned interactions. We here study the effect of
quenched noise in the interactions on the coding of positional information
within CANN. Using the replica method we compute the Fisher information for a
network with position-dependent input and recurrent connections composed of a
short-range (in space) and a disordered component. We find that the loss in
positional information is small for not too large disorder strength, indicating
that CANN have a regime in which the advantageous effects of local connectivity
on information storage outweigh the detrimental ones. Furthermore, a
substantial part of this information can be extracted with a simple linear
readout.

A giant Zn segregation transition is revealed using CALPHAD-integrated
density-based modelling of Zn segregation into Fe grain boundaries (GBs). The
results show that above a threshold of only a few atomic percent Zn in the
alloy, a substantial amount of up to 60 at.% Zn can segregate to the GB. We
also found that the amount of segregation significantly increases with
decreasing temperature, while the required Zn content in the alloy for
triggering the segregation transition decreases. Direct evidence of this Zn
segregation transition is obtained using high-resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy. We trace the origin of the segregation transition and its
temperature dependence back to the low cohesive energy of Zn and a miscibility
gap in Fe-Zn GB, arising from the magnetic ordering effect, which is
demonstrated by ab initio calculations. We show that the massive Zn segregation
resulting from the segregation transition greatly assists with liquid wetting
and reduces the work of separation along the GB. These findings reveal the
fundamental origin of GB weakening and therefore liquid metal embrittlement in
the Fe-Zn system.

Classical nanofluidic theories fail to describe the ionic transport in
Angstrom channels, where the conduction deviated from Ohm's law. Such deviation
was attributed to the dehydration/self-energy barrier known as Coulomb blockade
and dissociation of Bjerrum ion-pairs known as fractional Wien effects. Hereby
we found that identical cations bound to the surface charge blocked the ionic
transport in a single-file water channel. The presence of free ions
significantly increased the releasing probability of the bound ions due to
ion-ion interactions, resulting in ionic current. The I-E curve gradually turns
to be Ohmic with an increase of surface charge density, however reduces the
conduction amplitude as larger friction from more bound ions. We rationalized
the ionic transport by 1D Kramers' escape problem, which well predicted the I-E
curve and threshold electric field of conductive state transition. Our results
provide new insight views on Angstrom-scale ion conduction particularly for the
impact of surface charge density.

The honeycomb-lattice cobaltate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ has recently been
proposed to be a proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid~(QSL) candidate. However,
non-Kitaev terms in the Hamiltonian lead to a zigzag-type
antiferromagnetic~(AFM) order at low temperatures. Here, we partially
substitute magnetic Co$^{2+}$ with nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$ and investigate the
chemical doping effect in tuning the magnetic ground states of
Na$_3$Co$_{2-x}$Zn$_x$SbO$_6$. X-ray diffraction characterizations reveal no
structural transition but quite tiny changes on the lattice parameters over our
substitution range $0\leq x\leq0.4$. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat
results both show that AFM transition temperature is continuously suppressed
with increasing Zn content $x$ and neither long-range magnetic order nor spin
freezing is observed when $x\geq0.2$. More importantly, a linear term of the
specific heat representing fermionic excitations is captured below 5~K in the
magnetically disordered regime, as opposed to the $C_{\rm m}\propto T^3$
behavior expected for bosonic excitations in the AFM state. Based on the data
above, we establish a magnetic phase diagram of Na$_3$Co$_{2-x}$Zn$_x$SbO$_6$.
Our results indicate the presence of gapless fractional excitations in the
samples with no magnetic order, evidencing a potential QSL state induced by
doping in a Kitaev system.

We propose a continuum model for the theoretical study of hybridized moir\'e
excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers, and we use a
variational method to solve the exciton wavefunction and calculate the optical
absorption spectrum. The exciton continuum model is built by the charge
continuum model for electrons and holes in moir\'e superlattices, thereby
preserving the moir\'e periodicity and lattice symmetry from the charge
continuum model. The momentum-space shift of interlayer electron-hole
distribution is included, and thus the indirect nature of interlayer excitons
is described. Spin and valley degrees of freedom and related interactions are
omitted in this model, except for the spin-orbit energy splitting of A and B
excitons. In long moir\'e-wavelength and zero charge-transfer-coupling limits,
the exciton model and the optical absorption formula can be reduced to the
counterparts of an isolated exciton. This continuum model is applied to the
simulation of optical absorption by hybridized moir\'e excitons in
$\text{WSe}_2$/$\text{WS}_2$ and $\text{MoSe}_2$/$\text{WS}_2$ heterobilayers.
Twist-angle and electric-field dependences of absorption spectra are studied.
Calculated spectra are compared with experimental observations in the
literature, and correspondences of signatures are found. The deficiency and the
potential of the present model are discussed.

The axion search experiments based on haloscopes at the Center for Axion and

South Korea are performed in the frequency range from 1 GHz to 6 GHz. In order
to perform the experiments in a strong magnetic field of 12 T and a
large-volume cavity of close to 40 liters, we use He wet dilution refrigerators
with immersed superconducting magnets. The measurements require continuous
operation for months without interruptions for microwave component
replacements. This is achieved by using different cryogenic engineering
approaches including microwave RF-switching. The critical components, defining
the scanning rate and the sensitivity of the setup, are the Josephson
parametric amplifiers (JPA) and cryogenic low noise amplifiers (cLNA) based on
high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) technology. It is desirable for both
devices to have a wide frequency range and low noise close to the quantum limit
for the JPA. In this paper, we show a recent design of a 4-channel measurement
setup for JPA and HEMT measurements. The setup is based on a 4-channel wideband
noise source (NS) and is used for both JPA and HEMT gain and noise
measurements. The setup is placed at 20 mK inside the dry dilution
refrigerator. The NS is thermally decoupled from the environment using plastic
spacers, superconducting wires and superconducting coaxial cables. We show the

The $S=3/2$ Kitaev honeycomb model (KHM) is unique among the spin-$S$ Kitaev
models due to a massive ground state quasi-degeneracy that hampered previous
numerical and analytical studies. In a recent work~\cite{jin2022unveiling}, we
showed how an SO(6) Majorana parton mean-field theory of the $S=3/2$ isotropic
KHM explains the anomalous features of this Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) in terms
of an emergent low-energy Majorana flat band. Away from the isotropic limit,
the $S=3/2$ KSL generally displays a quadrupolar order with gapped or gapless
Majorana excitations, features that were quantitatively confirmed by DMRG
simulations. In this paper, we explore the connection between the $S = 3/2$ KHM
with Kugel-Khomskii models and discover new exactly soluble examples for the
latter. We perform a symmetry analysis for the variational parton mean-field
\emph{Ans{\"a}tze} in the spin and orbital basis for different quantum liquid
phases of the $S=3/2$ KHM. Finally, we investigate a proposed time-reversal
symmetry breaking spin liquid induced by a {[}111{]} single ion anisotropy and
elucidate its topological properties as well as experimental signatures, e.g.
an unquantized thermal Hall response.

The physical properties of a quantum many-body system can, in principle, be
determined by diagonalizing the respective Hamiltonian, but the dimensions of
its matrix representation scale exponentially with the number of degrees of
freedom. Hence, only small systems that are described through simple models can
be tackled via exact diagonalization. To overcome this limitation, numerical
methods based on the renormalization group paradigm that restrict the quantum
many-body problem to a manageable subspace of the exponentially large full
Hilbert space have been put forth. A striking example is the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG), which has become the reference numerical method
to obtain the low-energy properties of one-dimensional quantum systems with
short-range interactions. Here, we provide a pedagogical introduction to DMRG,
presenting both its original formulation and its modern tensor-network-based
version. This colloquium sets itself apart from previous contributions in two
ways. First, didactic code implementations are provided to bridge the gap
between conceptual and practical understanding. Second, a concise and
self-contained introduction to the tensor network methods employed in the
modern version of DMRG is given, thus allowing the reader to effortlessly cross
the deep chasm between the two formulations of DMRG without having to explore
the broad literature on tensor networks. We expect this pedagogical review to
find wide readership amongst students and researchers who are taking their
first steps in numerical simulations via DMRG.

The spin Hall effect (SHE) can generate a pure spin current by an electric
current, which is promisingly used to electrically control magnetization. To
reduce power consumption of this control, a giant spin Hall angle (SHA) in the
SHE is desired in low-resistivity systems for practical applications. Here,
critical spin fluctuation near the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase-transition is
proved as an effective mechanism to create an additional part of SHE, named as
fluctuation spin Hall effect (FSHE). This FSHE enhances the SHA due to the AFM
spin fluctuation between conduction electrons and local spins. We detect the
FSHE with the inverse and direct spin Hall effect (ISHE and DSHE) set-up and
their temperature (T) dependences in the Cr/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs). The SHA is significantly enhanced when temperature is approached to the
N\'eel temperature (T_N) and has a peak value of -0.34 at 200 K near T_N. This
value is higher than the room-temperature value by 240% and comparable to that
of heavy metals Ta and W. Furthermore, the spin Hall resistivity of Cr well
fits the modeled T-dependence when T approaches T_N from low temperatures,
implying the AFM spin fluctuation nature of strong SHA enhancement. Thus, this
study demonstrates the critical spin fluctuation as a prospective way of
increasing SHA and enriches the AFM material candidates for spin-orbitronic
devices.

We study the exciton states in the symmetrically biased dice model, the
electronic structures of which have an isolated flat band between two
dispersive bands. At 1/3 or 2/3 filling, the model describes a two-dimensional
semiconductor with the band edge at two degenerate valleys. Because of
qualitative changes in the eigenvectors resulting from the bias term, the
interband transition between the flat band and a dispersive band is valley
contrasting under circularly polarized light. In terms of an effective-mass
model and a realistic electron-hole interaction, we numerically calculate the
spectrum and wave functions of the intravalley excitons, which are treated as
Wannier-Mott excitons. We also discuss the fine structures of the exciton
spectrum induced by the intravalley and intervalley exchange interactions. The
symmetrically biased dice model thereby proves to be a new platform for
valley-contrasting optoelectronics.

Fast measurements of quantum devices is important in areas such as quantum

superconducting readout resonator interfaced to a silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
chiplet containing quantum dots (QDs) in a high-$\kappa$ nanowire transistor.
The superconducting chiplet contains resonant and coupling elements as well as
$LC$ filters that, when interfaced with the silicon chip, result in a resonant
frequency $f=2.12$~GHz, a loaded quality factor $Q=680$, and a resonator
impedance $Z=470$~$\Omega$. Combined with the large gate lever arms of SOI
technology, we achieve a minimum integration time for single and double QD
transitions of 2.77~ns and 13.5~ns, respectively. We utilize the assembly to
measure charge noise over 9 decades of frequency up to 500~kHz and find a 1/$f$
dependence across the whole frequency spectrum as well as a charge noise level
of 4~$\mu$eV/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1~Hz. The modular microwave circuitry
presented here can be directly utilized in conjunction with other quantum

noise spectroscopy, all without the complexity of superconductor-semiconductor

Although point defects in solids are one of the most promising physical
systems to build functioning qubits, it remains challenging to position them in
a deterministic array and to integrate them into large networks. By means of
advanced ab initio calculations we show that undissociated screw dislocations
in cubic 3C-SiC, and their associated strain fields, could be used to create a
deterministic pattern of relevant point defects. Specifically, we present a
detailed analysis of the formation energies and electronic structure of the
divacancy in 3C-SiC when located in the vicinity of this type of dislocations.
Our results show that the divacancy is strongly attracted towards specific and
equivalent sites inside the core of the screw dislocations, and would form a
one-dimensional arrays along them. Furthermore, we show that the same strain
that attracts the divacancy allows the modulation of the position of its
electronic states and of its charge transition levels. In the case of the
neutral divacancy, we find that these modulations result in the loss of its
potential as a qubit. However, these same modulations could transform defects
with no potential as qubits when located in bulk, into promising defects when
located inside the core of the screw dislocations. Since dislocations are still
mostly perceived as harmful defects, our findings represent a technological
leap as they show that dislocations can be used as active building blocks in
future defect-based quantum computers.

Phosphorene, a 2D allotrope of phosphorus, is technologically very appealing
because of its semiconducting properties and narrow band gap. Further reduction
of the phosphorene dimensionality may spawn exotic properties of its electronic
structure, including lateral quantum confinement and topological edge states.
Phosphorene atomic chains self-assembled on Ag(111) have recently been
characterized structurally but were found by angle-resolved photoemission
(ARPES) to be electronically 2D. We show that these chains, although aligned
equiprobably to three <$1 \bar{1} 0$> directions of the Ag(111) surface, can be
characterized by ARPES because the three rotational variants are separated in
the angular domain. The dispersion of the phosphorus band measured along and
perpendicular to the chains reveals pronounced electronic confinement resulting
in a 1D band, flat and dispersionless perpendicular to the chain direction in
momentum space. Our density functional theory calculations reproduce the 1D
band for the experimentally determined structure of P/Ag(111). We predict a
semiconductor-to-metal phase transition upon increasing the density of the
chain array so that a 2D structure would be metallic.

Slide electrification - the spontaneous charge separation by sliding water
drops - can lead to an electrostatic potential of 1 kV and change drop motion
substantially. To find out, how slide electrification influences the contact
angles of moving drops, we analyzed the dynamic contact angles of aqueous drops
sliding down tilted plates with insulated surfaces, grounded surfaces, and
while grounding the drop. The observed decrease in dynamic contact angles at
different salt concentrations is attributed to two effects: An electrocapillary
reduction of contact angles caused by drop charging and a change in the free
surface energy of the solid due to surface charging.

<h3>The Quantum Measurement Spintronic Engine: Using Entanglement to Harvest  Vacuum Fluctuations</h3>

Several experimental reports have described electrical power output by
electronic devices that channel spin-polarized currents across paramagnetic
centers. Phononic radiation have been proposed as the source of the engine's
energy, though other hypotheses, such as quantum vacuum fluctuations, should
also be examined. This paper is the first of a series which will address these
hypotheses. Herein, we investigate the more basic hypothesis that quantum
vacuum fluctuations power a quantum engine that converts entanglement energy
into useful electrical work. The system under review is composed of two
atom-level quantum dots that are tunnel-coupled and exhibit a magnetic exchange
interaction. This working substance is connected in series with two
ferromagnetic electrodes. The engine cycle comprises two strokes. The
thermalizing stroke puts the system into equilibrium with the electrode baths,
leading to a release of electrical energy into the leads and to an increase in
the system entropy due to entanglement. Then the measurement stroke breaks the
entanglement between the two quantum dots, thereby reducing its entropy while
energizing it on average. Using a perturbative master equation approach, we
analytically demonstrate the efficiency of the engine, and we study the cycle
numerically to gain insight into the relevant parameters to maximize power.
Although the possibility of harvesting energy from the quantum vacuum
fluctuations and the interactions with the baths is proven on paper and
confirmed by numerical experiments, the efficiency remains low and is unstable.
Our results indicate that quantum vacuum fluctuations alone are unlikely to be
the energy source in the the quantum spintronic engine experiments that have
been reported thus far.

Ribbons of two-dimensional lattices have properties depending sensitively on
the morphology of the two edges. For regular ribbons with two parallel straight
edges, the atomic chains terminating the two edges may have more than one
choices for a general edge orientation. We enumerate the possible choices for
zigzag dice lattice ribbons, which are regular ribbons of the dice lattice with
edges parallel to a zigzag direction, and explore the relation between the edge
morphologies and their electronic spectra. A formula is introduced to count the
number of distinct edge termination morphologies for the regular ribbons, which
gives 18 distinct edge termination morphologies for the zigzag dice lattice
ribbons. For the pure dice model, because the equivalence of the two rim
sublattices, the numerical spectra of the zigzag ribbons show qualitative
degeneracies among the different edge termination morphologies. For the
symmetrically biased dice model, we see a one-to-one correspondence between the
18 edge termination morphologies and their electronic spectra, when both the
zero-energy flat bands and the dispersive or nonzero-energy in-gap states are
considered. We analytically study several interesting features in the
electronic spectra, including the number and wave functions of the zero-energy
flat bands, and the analytical spectrum of novel in-gap states. The in-gap
states of the zigzag dice lattice ribbons both exhibit interesting similarities
and show salient differences when compared to the spectra of the zigzag ribbons
of the honeycomb lattice.

<h3>From ultra-fast growth to avalanche growth in devitrifying glasses</h3>

<br>
<br>
During devitrification, pre-existing crystallites grow by adding particles to
their surface via a process which is either thermally activated (diffusive
mode), or happens without kinetic barriers (fast crystal growth mode). It is
yet unclear what factors determine the crystal growth mode, and how to predict
it. With simulations of repulsive hard-sphere glasses, we show for the first
time that the same system at the same volume fraction and temperature can
devitrify via both modes depending on the preparation protocol of the glass. We
prepare two types of glass, a conventional glass (CG) via fast quenching and a
uniform glass (UG) via density homogenization. Firstly, we bring either glass
into contact with a crystal (X) and find the inherent structure (CGX/UGX).
During energy minimization, the crystal front grows deep into the CG interface,
while the growth is minimal for UG. When thermal noise is added, this behavior
is reflected in different crystallization dynamics. CGX exhibits a density drop
at the crystal growth front, leading to enhanced dynamics at the interface and
a fast growth mode. This mechanism may explain the faster crystal growth
observed below the glass transition experimentally. In contrast, UGX grows via
intermittent avalanche-like dynamics localized at the interface, a combination
of localized mechanical defects and the exceptional mechanical stability
imposed by the UG glass phase.

<h3>Lessons from the harmonic oscillator -- a reconciliation of the  Frequency-Resolved Frozen Phonon Multislice Method with other theoretical  approaches</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13510</a>
<br>
<i>Paul M. Zeiger, Juri Barthel, Leslie J. Allen, Ján Rusz</i>
<br>
<br>
We compare the Frequency-Resolved Frozen Phonon Multislice (FRFPMS) method,
introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 025501 (2020), with other theoretical
approaches used to account for the inelastic scattering of high energy
electrons, namely the first-order Born approximation and the quantum excitation
of phonons model. We show, that these theories lead to similar expressions for
the single inelastically scattered intensity as a function of momentum transfer
for an anisotropic quantum harmonic oscillator in a weak phase object
approximation of the scattered waves, except for a too small smearing of the
scattering potential by the effective Debye-Waller factor (DWF) in the FRFPMS
method. We propose that this issue can be fixed by including an explicit DWF
smearing into the potential and demonstrate numerically, that in any realistic
situation, a FRFPMS approach revised in this way, correctly accounts for the
single inelastically scattered intensity and the correct elastic scattering
intensity. Furthermore our simulations illustrate that the only requirement for
such a revised FRFPMS method is the smallness of mean squared displacements for
all atomic species in all frequency bins. The analytical considerations for the
FRFPMS method also explain the $1/\omega^2$-scaling of FRFPMS spectra observed
in Phys. Rev. B 104, 104301 (2021) by the use of classical statistics in the
molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, we find that the FRFPMS method
inherently adds the contributions of phonon loss and gain within each frequency
bin. Both of these issues related to the frequency-scaling can be fixed by a
system-independent post-processing step.

<h3>Trajectories of square lattice staircase polygons</h3>

<br>
<br>
The distribution of monomers in a coating of grafted and adsorbing polymers
is modelled using a grafted staircase polygon in the square lattice. The
adsorbing staircase polygon consists of a bottom and a top lattice path
(branches) and the asymptotic probability density that vertices in the lattice
are occupied by these paths is determined. This is a model consisting of two
linear polymers grafted to a hard wall in a coating. The probability that
either the bottom, or the top, path of a staircase polygon passes through a
lattice site with coordinates $(\lfloor \epsilon n \rfloor,\lfloor \delta
\sqrt{n}\rfloor)$, for $0 < \epsilon < 1$ and $\delta\geq 0$, is determined
asymptotically as $n\to\infty$. This gives the probability density of vertices
in the staircase polygon in the scaling limit (as $n\to\infty$):
$\displaystyle {\mathbb P}_r^{f,(both)} (\epsilon,\delta) =
\frac{\delta^2(15\,\epsilon^2(1 - \epsilon)^2 - 12\, \delta^2 \epsilon(1 -
\epsilon) + 4\, \delta^4 ) }{3\sqrt{\pi\,\epsilon^7(1 - \epsilon)^7}} \,
e^{-\delta^2/\epsilon(1 - \epsilon)} .$
The densities of other cases, grafted and adsorbed, and at the adsorption
critical point (or special point), are also determined. In these cases the most
likely and mean trajectories of the paths are determined. The results show that
low density regions in the distribution induces entropic forces on test
particles which confine them next to the hard wall, or between branches of the
staircase polygon. These results give qualitative mechanisms for the
stabilisation of a drug particle confined to a polymer coating in a drug
delivery system such as a drug-eluding stent covered by a grafted polymer.

<h3>Signatures of Hund Metal and Fermi Liquid Behavior in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$  Revealed by Electronic Raman Scattering</h3>

<i>Germán Blesio, Sophie Beck, Antoine Georges, Jernej Mravlje</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic Raman scattering of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using a
material-realistic dynamical mean-field theory approach. We identify the
low-energy Fermi liquid behavior and point out that the enhanced Raman response
at higher energies displays clear signatures of Hund metals physics. These
signatures originate in the two-stage coherence of Hund metals and associated
quasiparticle 'unrenormalization'. In agreement with recent experimental
observations we find a strong dichotomy between the $\mathrm{B}_{1g}$ and
$\mathrm{B}_{2g}$ response, but our calculations suggest a novel interpretation
of this dichotomy. The $\mathrm{B}_{1g}$ response is dominated by the $xy$
orbital and the $\mathrm{B}_{2g}$ response receives contributions from all
orbitals and is strongly affected by interband nesting at finite frequencies.

<h3>Quantum many-body scars in spin models with multi-body interactions</h3>

<br>
<i>Kazuyuki Sanada, Yuan Miao, Hosho Katsura</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and study several classes of quantum spin models with multi-body
interactions that exhibit quantum many-body scars. The models are constructed
by two different methods: one exploiting boundary states in integrable spin
chains and the other based on a variant of existing methods such as restricted
spectrum generating algebras. The first method allows us to construct
deformations of the Majumdar-Ghosh and Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki models --
prototypes of frustration-free systems. With the second method, we construct a
large class of spin-$1$ models involving scalar spin chirality in both one and
two dimensions. Interestingly, in some cases, the models so constructed have
towers of scar states of different character. For each example, we show that
the scar states behave differently from thermal states by comparing their
spectral and dynamical properties with those of other states. We also show that
a superposition of the scar states constructed by the second method exhibits
perfectly periodic revivals in the dynamics.

We show that four narrow zigzag dice lattice ribbons, which have the minimal
widths among their separate categories, constitute a unique collection of
systems to study physics related to one-dimensional Dirac cones and flat bands.
In zero magnetic field, all three combinations, including only Dirac cones,
only flat bands, coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, are realized in the
low-energy band structures of one or two of the four ribbons. In particular, we
identify flat bands and Dirac cones corresponding to the edge states of wide
ribbons. In a perpendicular magnetic field that gives half a flux quantum per
elementary rhombus, two of the four minimal ribbons have fully pinched
spectrum, and dynamical evolutions from initially localized wave packets always
lead to compact Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cages. The experimental realizations of
these narrow zigzag dice lattice ribbons, and the opportunities of exploring
novel single-body and many-body physics therein are discussed.

The infrared response of a system of two vibrational modes in a cavity is
calculated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived by employing the
nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) formalism. Degeneracies of the
Hamiltonian (exceptional points, EP) widely employed in theoretical analysis of
optical cavity spectroscopies are used in an approximate treatment and compared
with the full NEGF. Qualitative limitations of the EP treatment are explained
by examining the approximations employed in the calculation.

Since temperature and its spatial and temporal variations affect a wide range
of physical properties of material systems, they can be used to create
reconfigurable spatial structures of various types in physical and biological
objects. This paper presents an experimental optical setup for creating tunable
two-dimensional temperature patterns on a micrometer scale. As an example of
its practical application, we have produced temperature-induced magnetization
landscapes in ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet films and investigated them
using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. It is shown that,
due to the temperature dependence of the magnon spectrum, temperature changes
can be visualized even for microscale thermal patterns.

Glasses obtained from vapor deposition on a cold substrate have superior
thermodynamic and kinetic stability with respect to ordinary glasses. Here we
perform molecular dynamics simulations of vapor deposition of a model
glass-former and investigate the origin of its high stability compared to that
of ordinary glasses. We find that the vapor deposited glass is characterized by
locally favoured structures (LFS) whose occurrence correlates with its
stability, reaching a maximum at the optimal deposition temperature. The
formation of LFS is enhanced near the free surface, hence supporting the idea
that the stability of vapor deposited glasses is connected to the relaxation
dynamics at the surface.

A major challenge in the study of active matter lies in quantitative
characterization of phases and transitions between them. We show how the
entropy of a collection of active objects can be used to classify regimes and
spatial patterns in their collective behavior. Specifically, we estimate the
contributions to the total entropy from correlations between the degrees of
freedom of position and orientation. This analysis pin-points the flocking
transition in the Vicsek model while clarifying the physical mechanism behind
the transition. When applied to experiments on swarming Bacillus subtilis with
different cell aspect ratios and overall bacterial area fractions, the entropy
analysis reveals a rich phase diagram with transitions between qualitatively
different swarm statistics. We discuss physical and biological implications of
these findings.

One of the most notable features in repulsive particle based active matter
systems is motility-induced-phase separation (MIPS) where a dense, often
crystalline phase coexists with a low density fluid. In most active matter
studies, the activity is kept constant as a function of time; however, there
are many examples of active systems in which individual particles transition
from living or moving to dead or nonmotile due to lack of fuel, infection, or
poisoning. Here we consider an active matter particle system at densities where
MIPS does not occur. When we add a small number of infected particles that can
effectively poison other particles, rendering them nonmotile, we find a rich
variety of time dependent pattern formation, including MIPS, a wetting phase,
and a fragmented state formed when mobile particles plow through an nonmotile
packing. We map out the patterns as a function of time scaled by the duration
of the epidemic, and show that the pattern formation is robust for a wide range
of poisoning rates and activity levels. We also show that pattern formation
does not occur in a random death model, but requires the promotion of
nucleation by contact poisoning. Our results should be relevant to biological
and active matter systems where there is some form of poisoning, death, or
transition to nonmotility.

Parisi demonstrated in 1979 that pairwise interactions exhibit a glass spin
phase when there is disorder. While he discovered an equilibrium solution of
the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin-glass model and we know it as a
continuous phase transition, the model dedicated to pairwise interactions and
higher-order interactions has not been addressed. This research intends to
determine whether this phase exists in triplet interactions. Due to the
intractable nature of the three interacting spins alone, we employed a
perturbation approach to provide an analytical solution for the triplet
interactions in the background of the SK spin-glass model. Our results show the
existence of this phase in the third-order interaction and a sudden transition
that indicates a change in the nature of a glassy spin system transitioning
from the continuous order to the first order. It causes a forward shift in the
critical temperature by identifying the frustration of triplet interactions.

Realizing hybrids of low-dimensional Kondo lattices and superconducting
substrates leads to fascinating platforms for studying the exciting physics of
strongly correlated electron systems with induced superconducting pairing.
Here, we report a scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study of a new
type of two-dimensional (2D) La-Ce alloy grown epitaxially on a superconducting
Re(0001) substrate. We observe the characteristic spectroscopic signature of a
hybridization gap evidencing the coherent spin screening in the 2D Kondo
lattice realized by the ultrathin La-Ce alloy film on normal conducting
Re(0001). Upon lowering the temperature below the critical temperature of
rhenium, a superconducting gap is induced with an in-gap Shiba band arising
from the interaction of residual unscreened magnetic moments with the
superconducting substrate. A positive correlation between the Kondo
hybridization gap and the binding energy of the subgap Shiba band maximum is
found. Our results open up a promising route toward the design of artificial
superconducting Kondo and heavy fermion systems.

Isolated magnetic skyrmions are stable, topologically protected spin textures
that are at the forefront of research interests today due to their potential
applications in information technology. A distinct class of skyrmion hosts are
rare earth - transition metal (RE-TM) ferrimagnetic materials. To date, the
nature and the control of basic traits of skyrmions in these materials are not
fully understood. We show that for an archetypal ferrimagnetic material that
exhibits strong perpendicular anisotropy, the ferrimagnetic skyrmion size can
be tuned by external magnetic fields. Moreover, by taking advantage of the high
spatial resolution of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and
utilizing a large x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) contrast that occurs
naturally at the RE resonant edges, we resolve the nature of the magnetic
domain walls of ferrimagnetic skyrmions. We demonstrate that through this
method one can easily discriminate between Bloch and N\'eel type domain walls
for each individual skyrmion. For all isolated ferrimagnetic skyrmions, we
observe that the domain walls are of N\'eel-type. This key information is
corroborated with results of micromagnetic simulations and allows us to
conclude on the nature of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) which
concurs to the stabilisation of skyrmions in ferrimagnetic systems.
Establishing that an intrinsic DMI occurs in RE-TM materials will also be
beneficial towards a deeper understanding of chiral spin texture control in
ferrimagnetic materials.

Elongated colloidal rods at sufficient packing conditions are known to form
stable lamellar or smectic phases. Using a simplified volume-exclusion model,
we propose a generic equation-of-state for hard-rod smectics that is robust
against simulation results and is independent of the rod aspect ratio. We then
extend our theory by exploring the elastic properties of a hard-rod smectic,
including the layer compressibility ($B$) and bending modulus ($K_{1}$). By
introducing weak backbone flexibility we are able to compare our predictions
with experimental results on smectics of filamentous virus rods and find
quantitative agreement between the smectic layer spacing, the out-of-plane
fluctuation strength, as well as the smectic penetration length $\lambda =
\sqrt{K_{1}/B}$. We demonstrate that the layer bending modulus is dominated by
director splay and depends sensitively on lamellar out-of-plane fluctuations
that we account for on the single-rod level. We find that the ratio between the
smectic penetration length and the lamellar spacing is about two orders of
magnitude smaller than typical values reported for thermotropic smectics. We
attribute this to the fact that colloidal smectics are considerably softer in
terms of layer compression than their thermotropic counterparts while the cost
of layer bending is of comparable magnitude.

A system having macroscopic patches in different topological phases have no
well-defined global topological invariant. To treat such a case, the quantities
labeling different areas of the sample according to their topological state are
used, dubbed local topological markers. Here we study their dynamics. We
concentrate on two quantities, namely local Chern marker and on-site charge
induced by an applied magnetic field. We demonstrate that the time-dependent
local Chern marker is much more non-local object than equilibrium one.
Surprisingly, in large samples driven out of equilibrium, it leads to a simple
description of the local Chern marker's dynamics by a local continuity
equation. Also, we argue that the connection between the local Chern marker and
magnetic-field induced charge known in static holds out of equilibrium in some
experimentally relevant systems as well. This gives a clear physical
description of the marker's evolution and provides a simple recipe for
experimental estimation of the topological marker's value.

While Hopfield networks are known as paradigmatic models for memory storage
and retrieval, modern artificial intelligence systems mainly stand on the
machine learning paradigm. We show that it is possible to formulate a
teacher-student self-supervised learning problem with Boltzmann machines in
terms of a suitable generalization of the Hopfield model with structured
patterns, where the spin variables are the machine weights and patterns
correspond to the training set's examples. We analyze the learning performance
by studying the phase diagram in terms of the training set size, the dataset
noise and the inference temperature (i.e. the weight regularization). With a
small but informative dataset the machine can learn by memorization. With a
noisy dataset, an extensive number of examples above a critical threshold is
needed. In this regime the memory storage limits of the system becomes an
opportunity for the occurrence of a learning regime in which the system can
generalize.

We investigate a 2+1-D interacting Dirac semimetal with onsite flavor SU(2)
symmetry. Topological considerations imply that the skyrmions in the
flavor-symmetry-breaking phase carry electron quantum numbers, motivating a
dual bosonized low energy description in terms of two complex scalars coupled
to an abelian Chern-Simons field. We propose that the transition between a
nearby Chern insulator and the flavor symmetry-broken phase is a bicritical
point in the bosonized description, and also suggest that the
Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg (GNH) transition between the Dirac semimetal and the
flavor symmetry-broken phase is a tricritical point. Heuristically, the dual
description corresponds to the gap closing of fermionic skyrmions. We discuss
implications and potential issues with our proposal, and motivated from it,
perform extensive unbiased Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations
on a lattice regularized Hamiltonian for the GNH transition, extending
previously available results. We compare DQMC results with the estimates in the
proposed dual from available perturbative renormalization group results. We
also numerically demonstrate the presence of fermionic skyrmions in the
symmetry-broken phase of our lattice model.
