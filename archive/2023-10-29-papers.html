<h3>Diffusive-hydrodynamic transition in the anomalous Hall effect</h3>

We have developed a theory of the anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional
electron gas in the case where the time of electron-electron collisions is much
smaller than the transport relaxation time. The transition between the
diffusion transport regime, when the momentum relaxation length of electrons is
much smaller than the channel width, and the hydrodynamic regime, when the
momentum relaxation length exceeds the channel width, has been traced. The
contributions of the anomalous velocity, wave packet shifts, and asymmetric
scattering to the anomalous Hall field and voltage have been calculated. It has
been shown that the anomalous Hall voltage caused by the asymmetric scattering
can have a nontrivial coordinate dependence and change its sign depending on
the specific scattering mechanism.

<h3>Scale-invariant phase transition of disordered bosons in one dimension</h3>

The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and
non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally
expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show
that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with
distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with
power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We
use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for
different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha > 2$.
We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is
scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior
incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions
in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find
that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the
Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of
disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha>3$ our data are consistent with
a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.

<h3>Pair-density-wave and $s\pm \mathrm{i}d$ superconductivity in a strongly  coupled, lightly doped Kondo insulator</h3>

We investigate the large Kondo coupling limit of the Kondo-Heisenberg model
on one- and two-dimensional lattices. Focusing on the possible superconducting
states when slightly doping the Kondo insulator state, we identify different
pairing modes to be most stable in different parameter regimes. Possibilities
include uniform s-wave, pair-density-wave with momentum $\pi$ (in both one and
two dimensions) and uniform $s\pm \mathrm{i}d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (in two
dimensions). We attribute these exotic pairing states to the presence of
various pair-hopping terms with a "wrong" sign in the effective model, a
mechanism that is likely universal for inducing pairing states with spatially
modulated pair wavefunctions.

<h3>Recovery of a Luther-Emery phase in the three-band Hubbard model with  longer-range hopping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17706</a>
<br>
<i>Luhang Yang, Thomas P. Devereaux, Hong-Chen Jiang</i>
<br>
<br>
A lightly doped single-band Hubbard model on a two leg ladder exhibits a
Luther-Emery phase, while the three-band Hubbard ladder behaves as a Luttinger
liquid upon hole doping. In order to understand this discrepancy, we present a
systematic density-matrix renormalization group study of the three-band Hubbard
model on two-leg cylinders with further-neighbor particle hoppings. The
inclusion of the longer-range hopping is motivated by the studies of the
single-band Hubbard model in which the further-neighbor hopping terms are
suggested to be crucial for the unconventional superconductivity. When the
longer-range hopping parameters are small, the ground state is a Luttinger
liquid having mutually commensurate superconducting, charge and spin density
wave correlations. Increasing the longer-range hopping drives a transition into
a Luther-Emery phase with quasi-long ranged superconducting and charge orders
but short-ranged spin-spin correlations. By down-folding the three-band Hubbard
model into an effective $t$-$t'$-$J$-$J'$ model, we find that in the
Luther-Emery phase, both the nearest and second neighbor kinetic energies are
enhanced due to an effective increase of copper-oxygen hybridization.
Amplifying inter-cell oxygen orbital hopping mirrors the benefits of reducing
the charge transfer energy, causing doped holes to favor oxygen orbitals and
strengthening superconducting pairing.

<h3>The Interplay Between Imprint, Wake-Up Like Effects and Domains in  Ferroelectric AlScN</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17718</a>
<br>
<i>Maike Gremmel, Simon Fichtner</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper investigates wake-up and imprint in ferroelectric AlScN films. The
study employs a series of I-V and P-E measurements with varying electric field
amplitudes and voltage cycles as well as structural investigation via Scanning
Electron Microscopy to understand the origin and underlying principle of
wake-up and imprint as well as their relation. It is shown that the material
can be considered wake-up free, however inherent imprint and imprint shift in
combination with minor loops result in a wake-up like effect. We introduce a
proposition to explain the influence of initial switching cycles on domains,
their stabilization and corresponding changes in imprint. Unipolar fields and
temperature investigations are used to explore the reversibility of imprint and
ways to program it, while partial switching is applied to investigate domain
propagation and support the aforementioned approach. It is concluded, that
after an energetically more demanding domain nucleation, domain wall motion can
switch the majority of polarization in Al1-xScxN. As a consequence, the
presence of initial domains reduces the coercive field in respect to unipolar
films.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly attractive to build the
channel of next-generation field-effect transistors (FETs) with gate lengths
below 10-15 nm. Because the 2D technology has not yet reached the same level of
maturity as its Silicon counterpart, device simulation can be of great help to
predict the ultimate performance of 2D FETs and provide experimentalists with
reliable design guidelines. In this paper, an ab initio modelling approach
dedicated to well-known and exotic 2D materials is presented and applied to the
simulation of various components, from thermionic to tunnelling transistors
based on mono- and multi-layer channels. Moreover, the physics of metal - 2D
semiconductor contacts is revealed and the importance of different scattering
sources on the mobility of selected 2D materials is discussed. It is expected
that modeling frameworks similar to the one described here will not only
accompany future developments of 2D devices, but will also enable them.

<h3>Unconventional Superconductivity near a Nematic Instability in a  Multi-Orbital system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17728" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17728</a>
<br>
<i>Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Andrey Chubukov</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze superconductivity in a multi-orbital fermionic system near the
onset of a nematic order, using doped FeSe as an example. We associate the
nematic order with spontaneous polarization between $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$
orbitals. We derive the pairing interaction, mediated by soft nematic
fluctuations, and show that it is attractive, and that its strength depends on
the position on the Fermi surface. As the consequence, right at the nematic
quantum-critical point (QCP), superconducting gap opens up at $T_c$ only at
special points and extends into finite arcs at $T < T_c$. In between the arcs
the Fermi surface remains intact. This gives rise to highly unconventional
behavior of the specific heat, with no jump at $T_c$ and an apparent finite
offset at $T=0$, when extrapolated from a finite $T$. We argue that this
behavior is consistent with the specific heat data for FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ near
critical $x$ for the onset of a nematic order. We discuss the behavior of the
gap away from a QCP and the pairing symmetry, and apply the results to
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, which both show superconducting
behavior near the QCP distinct from that in a pure FeSe.

<h3>Measuring Topological Field Theories: Lattice Models and Field-Theoretic  Description</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17740" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17740</a>
<br>
<i>Yabo Li, Mikhail Litvinov, Tzu-Chieh Wei</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in performing measurements
within topological phases of matter, e.g., symmetry-protected topological (SPT)
phases and topological orders. Notably, measurements of certain SPT states have
been known to be related to Kramers-Wannier duality and Jordan-Wigner
transformations, giving rise to long-range entangled states and invertible
phases, such as the Kitaev chain. Moreover, measurements of topologically
ordered states correspond to charge condensations. In this work, we present a
field-theoretic framework for describing measurements within topological field
theories. We employ various lattice models as examples to illustrate the
outcomes of measuring local symmetry operators within topological phases,
demonstrating their agreement with the predictions from field-theoretic
descriptions. We demonstrate that these measurements can lead to SPT,
spontaneous symmetry-breaking, and topologically ordered phases. Specifically,
when there is emergent symmetry after measurement, the remaining symmetry and
emergent symmetry will have a mixed anomaly, which leads to long-ranged
entanglement.

<h3>A Critical Assessment of Electronic Structure Descriptors for Predicting  Perovskite Catalytic Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17744" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17744</a>

The discovery and design of new materials which can efficiently catalyze the
oxygen reduction and evolution reactions at reduced temperatures is important
for facilitating the widespread adoption of fuel cell and electrolyzer
technologies. Numerous studies have produced correlations between catalytic
properties, such as oxygen surface exchange or electrode area specific
resistance (ASR), and properties of the catalyst material. However,
correlations have historically been limited in scope (e.g., using only a few
materials or at a single temperature) and it has been difficult to provide
detailed assessments of their robustness. Here, we assess the ability of the O
p-band center electronic structure descriptor, obtained from density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, to correlate with oxygen surface exchange rates,
diffusivities, and area specific resistances for a large database of perovskite
oxide catalytic properties. By data mining the literature, we obtain 747
catalytic property value data points spanning 299 unique perovskite
compositions from 313 studies. We assess linear correlations of each property
with the O p-band center and find generally modest correlations that are
qualitatively useful (prediction mean absolute errors of about 0.5 log units
are typical), where the correlations are improved at higher temperatures (e.g.,
800 {\deg}C vs. 500 {\deg}C) and significantly improve when considering fits to
the subset of materials which have multiple independent measurements. These
findings suggest that the spread of property data is significantly influenced
by experimental uncertainty, and subsequent measurements of additional
materials will likely improve the O p-band center correlations.

<h3>Microscopic origin of tunable assembly forces in chiral active  environments</h3>

The fluctuations of a nonequilibrium bath enable dynamics inaccessible to any
equilibrium system. Exploiting the driven dynamics of active matter in order to
do useful work has become a topic of significant experimental and theoretical
interest. Due to the unique modalities controlling self-assembly, the interplay
between passive solutes and the particles in an active bath has been studied as
a potential driving force to guide assembly of otherwise non-interacting
objects. Here, we investigate and characterize the microscopic origins of the
attractive and repulsive interactions between passive solutes in an active
bath. We show that, while assembly does not occur dynamically for achiral
active baths, chiral active particles can produce stable and robust assembly
forces. We both explain the observed oscillatory force profile for active
Brownian particles and demonstrate that chiral active motion leads to fluxes
consistent with an odd diffusion tensor that, when appropriately tuned,
produces long-ranged assembly forces.

<h3>Prospects for thermalization of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17812" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17812</a>
<br>
<i>Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn</i>
<br>
<br>
We study anisotropic thermalization in dilute gases of microwave shielded
polar molecular fermions. For collision energies above the threshold regime, we
find that thermalization is suppressed due to a strong preference for forward
scattering and a reduction in total cross section with energy, significantly
reducing the efficiency of evaporative cooling. We perform close-coupling
calculations on the effective potential energy surface derived by Deng et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 183001 (2023)], to obtain accurate 2-body elastic
differential cross sections across a range of collision energies. We use
Gaussian process regression to obtain a global representation of the
differential cross section, over a wide range of collision angles and energies.
The route to equilibrium is then analyzed with cross-dimensional
rethermalization experiments, quantified by a measure of collisional efficiency
toward achieving thermalization.

<h3>Distinct contiguous versus separated triplet-pair multiexcitons in an  intramolecular singlet fission chromophore</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17818</a>
<br>
<i>R. Chesler, P. Bhattacharyya, A. Shukla, S. Mazumdar</i>
<br>
<br>
We show from many-body quantum mechanical calculations that there occur
structurally distinct triplet-pair eigenstates in the intramolecular singlet
fission (iSF) compound pentacene-tetracene-pentacene. Triplet excitons occupy
neigboring pentacene and tetracene monomers in the higher energy doubly
degenerate triplet-triplet multiexcitons, and terminal pentacene chromophores
in the lower energy multiexciton. The lowest energy multiexciton is reached by
ultrafast triplet migration within the triplet-triplet manifold, a result with
profound implication for the design of superior iSF compounds.

<h3>Ab-initio study of the energy competition between Γand K valleys  in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17824</a>

<br>
<br>
Moir\'e engineering in two-dimensional van der Waals bilayer crystals has
emerged as a flexible platform for controlling strongly correlated electron
systems. The competition between valleys for the band extremum energy position
in the parent layers is crucial in deciding the qualitative nature of the
moir\'e Hamiltonian since it controls the physics of the moir\'e minibands.
Here we use density functional theory to examine the competition between K and
$\Gamma$ for the valence band maximum in homo- and hetero-bilayers formed from
the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), MX\{_2} where M=Mo,W and X=S,Se,Te.
We shed light on how the competition is influenced by interlayer separation,
which can be modified by applying pressure, by external gate-defined electric
fields, and by transition metal atom d-orbital correlations. Our findings are
related to several recent experiments, and contribute to the development of
design rules for moir\'{e} materials.

<h3>Optical Properties of LiNbO$_2$ thin films</h3>

<br>
<br>
The complex dielectric functions of LiNbO$_2$ were determined using optical
transmittance and reflectance spectroscopies at room temperature. The measured
dielectric function spectra reveal distinct structures at several bandgap
energies. The bandgaps (exciton resonances) in the spectrum were observed at
ca. 2.3, 3.2, 3.9, and 5.1 eV, respectively. These experimental data have been
fit using a model dielectric function based on the electronic energy-band
structure near critical points plus excitonic effects. The features of measured
dielectric functions are, to some extent, reproduced quantitatively by an
ab-initio calculation including the interaction effects between electrons and
holes.

<h3>Spin Selective Evolution of Zhang-Rice State in Binary Transition Metal  Oxide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17833" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17833</a>

<br>
<br>
The Zhang-Rice (ZR) state is a strongly hybridized bound state formed by the
transition metal and oxygen atoms. The spin-fluctuations within the ZR state
are known to play an important role in high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in
cuprates. Here, we employ a combination of angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and {\it ab
initio} embedded dynamical mean-field theory (eDMFT) to investigate the
influence of magnetic ordering on the spectral characteristics of the valence
band and Mn 2$p$ core-level in MnO (001) ultrathin films. Our results
demonstrate that a complex spin-selective evolution of Mn 3$d$$-$O 2$p$
hybridization develops due to the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering.
This hybridization significantly alters the spectral shape and weight of the ZR
state. Specifically, in the AFM phase, we observed the sharpening of the ZR
state and band folding with the periodicity of the AFM unit cell of MnO(001).
We also demonstrated a strong connection between the spectral evolution of the
ZR state and the non-local screening channels of the photoexcited core holes.
Further, our detailed temperature-dependent study reveals the presence of
short-range antiferromagnetic correlations that exist at much higher
temperatures than $T_\mathrm{N}$. Such comprehensive studies showing the
evolution of the ZR state across the magnetic transitions and its implication
to the core-hole screening have never been reported in any 3$d$ binary
transition metal oxides.

<h3>Strongly anisotropic vortices in dipolar quantum droplets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We construct strongly anisotropic quantum droplets with embedded vorticity in
the 3D space, with mutually perpendicular vortex axis and polarization of the
atomic magnetic moments. Stability of these anisotropic vortex quantum droplets
(AVQDs) is verified by means of systematic simulations. Their stability area is
identified in the parametric plane of the total atom number and scattering
length of contact interactions. The application of torque perpendicular to the
vorticity axis gives rise to robust intrinsic oscillations or rotation of the
AVQDs. Collisions between slowly and fast moving AVQDs give rise, respectively,
to the elastic outcome or merger. Finally, we construct stable
vortex-antivortex-vortex bound states and find their stability regions in the
parameter space.

<h3>Strain-Tunable Magnetic Compensation Temperature of Epitaxial  Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ Thin Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17841</a>

<br>
<br>
High-quality rare-earth iron garnet (ReIG) Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) thin
films are epitaxially grown on a series of (111)-oriented garnet substrates
with various lattice constants. The coherent growth induces a
substrate-dependent in-plane tensile or compressive strain in the TbIG film.
Measurements of the anomalous Hall-like effect (AHLE) in TbIG/Pt
heterostructures show that the compensation temperature of TbIG films
monotonically changes with the film strain. The strain results in a variation
of the distances between magnetic atoms in the TbIG crystal and therefore the
corresponding exchange interactions. The latter is explicitly calculated as a
function of the lattice strain based on density functional theory, reproducing
the observed experimental results. This work provides a versatile way to
optimize ReIG-based spin-orbit torque devices.

<h3>Realizing attractive interacting topological surface fermions: A  resonating TI- thin film hybrid platform</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17847" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17847</a>
<br>
<i>Saran Vijayan, Fei Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
In this article, we propose a practical way to realize topological surface
Dirac fermions with tunable attractive interaction between them. The approach
involves coating the surface of a topological insulator with a thin film metal
and utilizing the strong-electron phonon coupling in the metal to induce
interaction between the surface fermions. We found that for a given TI and thin
film, the attractive interaction between the surface fermions can be maximally
enhanced when the Dirac point of the TI surface resonates with one of the
quasi-2D quantum-well bands of the thin film. This effect can be considered to
be an example of 'quantum-well resonance'. We also demonstrate that the
superconductivity of the resonating surface fermions can be further enhanced by
choosing a strongly interacting thin film metal or by tuning the spin-orbit
coupling of the TI. This TI-thin film hybrid configuration holds promise for
applications in Majorana-based quantum computations and for the study of
quantum critical physics of strongly attractively interacting surface
topological matter with emergent supersymmetry.

<br>
<br>
Hund's metal is one kind of correlated metal, in which the electronic
correlation is strongly influenced by the Hund's interaction. At high
temperatures, while the charge and orbital degrees of freedom are quenched, the
spin degrees of freedom can persist in terms of frozen moments. As temperature
decreases, a coherent electronic state with characteristic orbital
differentiation always emerges at low temperatures through an
incoherent-to-coherent crossover, which has been widely observed in iron-based
superconductors (e.g., iron selenides and AFe2As2 (A = K, Rb, Cs)).
Consequently, the above frozen moments are "screened" by coupling to orbital
degrees of freedom, leading to an emergent Fermi-liquid state. In contrast, the
coupling among frozen moments should impede the formation of the Fermi-liquid
state by competitive magnetic ordering, which is still unexplored in Hund's
metal. Here, in the iron-based Hund's metal CsFe2As2, we adopt a chemical
substitution at iron sites by Cr/Co atoms to explore the competitive magnetic
ordering. By a comprehensive study of resistivity, magnetic susceptibility,
specific heat and nuclear magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that the
Fermi-liquid state is destroyed in Cr-doped CsFe2As2 by a spinfreezing
transition below T_g ~ 22 K. Meanwhile, the evolution of charge degrees of
freedom measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy also supports the
competition between the Fermi-liquid state and spin-glass state.

<h3>Electronic structure, magnetic correlations, and superconducting pairing  in the reduced Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ under pressure:  different role of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital compared with La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17871</a>

<i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
(327-LNO) under pressure stimulated much interest in layered nickelates.
However, superconductivity was not found in another bilayer nickelate system,
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ (326-LNO), even under pressure. Using density functional
theory and the random phase approximation (RPA), we systematically investigate
326-LNO under pressure. The large crystal-field splitting between the $e_g$
orbitals caused by the missing apical oxygen moves the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital
farther away from the Fermi level, implying that the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital
plays a less important role in 326-LNO than in 327-LNO. This also results in a
smaller bandwidth for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and a reduced energy gap for
the bonding-antibonding splitting of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital in 326-LNO, as
compared to 327-LNO. Moreover, the in-plane hybridization between the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is found to be small in 326-LNO,
while it is much stronger in 327-LNO. The weak inter-layer coupling suggests
that $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing is unlikely in 326-LNO. The robust in-plane
ferromagnetic coupling also suggests that d-wave superconductivity, which is
usually caused by antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital,
is also unlikely in 326-LNO. These conclusions are supported by our many-body
RPA calculations of the pairing behavior. Contrasting with the cuprates, for
the bilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_6$, we find a strong "self-doping
effect" of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital under pressure, with the charge of Cu
being reduced by approximately 0.13 electrons from 0 GPa to 25 GPa. In
contrast, we do not observe such a change in the electronic density in 326-LNO
under pressure, establishing another important difference between the
nickelates and the cuprates.

<h3>Ground state of the staggered Heisenberg-$Γ$ honeycomb model in a  magnetic field</h3>

<br>
We study the ground state properties of the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ staggered
Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ honeycomb model under a magnetic field based on analytical
and numerical methods. Our calculations show that the conventional zigzag and
stripy phases are favored because of the staggered Heisenberg interaction away
from the pure $\Gamma$ limit. In our classical analysis, we find that the field
induces a series of competing magnetic phases with relatively large unit cells
in the region sandwiched between the two magnetic phases with long-range
ordering. In the quantum treatment, these large magnetic unit cells are
destabilized by strong quantum fluctuations that result in the stabilization of
a gapless quantum spin liquid behavior. In a honeycomb $\Gamma$ magnet, we
disclose an intermediate-field gapless quantum spin liquid phase driven by a
tilted field away from the out-of-plane direction only for a narrow region

<h3>Twist- and gate-tunable proximity spin-orbit coupling, spin relaxation  anisotropy, and charge-to-spin conversion in heterostructures of graphene and  transition-metal dichalcogenides</h3>

We present a DFT-based investigation of the twist-angle dependent proximity
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene/TMDC structures. We find that for
Mo-based TMDCs the proximity valley-Zeeman SOC exhibits a maximum at around
15--20{\deg}, and vanishes at 30{\deg}, while for W-based TMDCs we find an
almost linear decrease of proximity valley-Zeeman SOC when twisting from
0{\deg} to 30{\deg}. The induced Rashba SOC is rather insensitive to twisting,
while acquiring a nonzero Rashba phase angle, $\varphi \in [-20;40]${\deg}, for
twist angles different from 0{\deg} and 30{\deg}. This finding contradicts
earlier tight-binding predictions that the Rashba angle can be 90{\deg} in the
studied systems. In addition, we study the influence of several tunability
knobs on the proximity SOC for selected twist angles. By applying a transverse
electric field in the limits of $\pm 2$ V/nm, mainly the Rashba SOC can be
tuned by about 50\%. The interlayer distance provides a giant tunability, since
the proximity SOC can be increased by a factor of 2--3, when reducing the
distance by about 10\%. Encapsulating graphene between two TMDCs, both twist
angles are important to control the interference of the individual proximity
SOCs, allowing to precisely tailor the valley-Zeeman SOC in graphene, while the
Rashba SOC becomes suppressed. Finally, based on our effective Hamiltonians
with fitted parameters, we calculate experimentally measurable quantities such
as spin lifetime anisotropy and charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies. The
spin lifetime anisotropy can become giant, up to $10^4$, in encapsulated
structures. The charge-to-spin conversion, which is due to spin-Hall and
Rashba-Edelstein effects, can lead to twist-tunable non-equilibrium
spin-density polarizations that are perpendicular and parallel to the applied
charge current.

Optical responses of atomically thin 2D materials are greatly influenced by
electron-hole interactions. It is by far established that exciton signatures
can be well-identified in the optical absorption spectrum of quasi-2D
materials. However, the same level of understanding of excitonic effects on
nonlinear optical responses and the ability to compute them accurately is still
much desired. Based on the functional integral formalisms and working in the
velocity gauge, we introduce a convenient Feynman diagram approach for
calculating nonlinear responses including excitonic effects. By dressing
electron-photon interactions with electron-hole ladder diagrams, we derive an
expression for second-order optical responses and provide a comprehensive
description of excitonic effects. We apply our approach to a monolayer h-BN
model and show qualitative changes in the second harmonic generation spectrum
when comparing with results assuming independent particles. Our approach can be
readily extended to higher order optical responses and is feasible for
first-principles calculations.

<br>
Based on a variational expression for the steady-state entropy production
rate in overdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive concrete upper bounds on the
entropy production rate in various physical settings. For particles in a
thermal environment and driven by non-conservative forces, we show that the
entropy production rate can be upper bounded by considering only the statistics
of the driven particles. We use this finding to argue that the presence of
non-driven, passive degrees of freedom generally leads to decreased
dissipation. Another upper bound can be obtained only in terms of the variance
of the non-conservative force, which leads to a universal upper bound for
particles that are driven by a constant force that is applied in a certain
region of space. Extending our results to systems attached to multiple heat
baths or with spatially varying temperature and/or mobility, we show that the
temperature difference between the heat baths or the gradient of the
temperature can be used to upper bound the entropy production rate. We show
that most of these results extend in a straightforward way to underdamped
Langevin dynamics and demonstrate them in three concrete examples.

Topological quantum matter exhibits novel transport phenomena driven by
entanglement between internal degrees of freedom, as for instance generated by
spin-orbit coupling effects. Here we report on a direct connection between the
mechanism driving spin relaxation and the intertwined dynamics between spin and
sublattice degrees of freedom in disordered graphene. Beyond having a direct
observable consequence, such intraparticle entanglement is shown to be
resilient to disorder, pointing towards a novel resource for quantum

The coherent quantum transport of matter wave through a ring-shaped circuit
attached to leads defines an iconic system in mesoscopic physics that has
allowed both to explore fundamental questions in quantum science and to draw
important avenues for conceiving devices of practical use.
Here we study the source-to-drain transport of excitations going through a
ring-network, without propagation of matter waves. We model the circuit in
terms of a spin system with specific long-range interactions that are relevant
for quantum technology, such as Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers or
ion traps. Inspired by the logic of rf- and dc-SQUIDs, we consider rings with
one and two local energy offsets, or detunings. As a combination of specific
phase shifts in going though the localized detunings and as a result of
coherent tunneling, we demonstrate how the transport of excitations can be
controlled, with a distinctive dependence on the range of interactions.

Degeneracies in multilayer graphene, including spin, valley, and layer
degrees of freedom, are susceptible to Coulomb interactions and can result into
rich broken-symmetry states. In this work, we report a ferromagnetic state in
charge neutral ABCA-tetralayer graphene driven by proximity-induced spin-orbit
coupling from adjacent WSe2. The ferromagnetic state is further identified as a
Chern insulator with Chern number of 4, and its Hall resistance reaches 78% and
100% quantization of h/4e2 at zero and 0.4 tesla, respectively. Three
broken-symmetry insulating states, layer-antiferromagnet, Chern insulator and
layer-polarized insulator and their transitions can be continuously tuned by
the vertical displacement field. Remarkably, the magnetic order of the Chern
insulator can be switched by three knobs, including magnetic field, electrical
doping, and vertical displacement field.

We analyze a quantized pumping in a nonlinear non-Hermitian photonic system
with nonadiabatic driving. The photonic system is made of a waveguide array,
where the distances between adjacent waveguides are modulated. It is described
by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model together with a saturated nonlinear gain term
and a linear loss term. A topological interface state between the topological
and trivial phases is stabilized by the combination of a saturated nonlinear
gain term and a linear loss term. We study the pumping of the topological
interface state. We define the transfer-speed ratio $\omega /\Omega $ by the
ratio of the pumping speed $% \omega $ of the center of mass of the wave packet
to the driving speed $ \Omega $ of the topological interface. It is quantized
as $\omega /\Omega =1$ in the adiabatic limit. It remains to be quantized for
slow driving even in the nonadiabatic regime, which is a nonadiabatic quantized
pump. On the other hand, there is almost no pump for fast driving. We find a
transition in pumping as a function of the driving speed.

Topological superconductors are a class of unconventional superconducting
materials featuring sub-gap zero-energy Majorana bound modes that hold promise
as a building block for topological quantum computing. In this work, we study
the realization of second-order topology that defines anomalous gapless
boundary modes in a two-orbital superconductor with spin-orbital couplings. We
reveal a time-reversal symmetry-breaking second-order topological
superconducting phase with $d+id$-wave orbital-dependent paring without the
need for the external magnetic field. Remarkably, this orbital-active $d$-wave
paring gives rise to anomalous zero-energy Majorana corner modes, which is in
contrast to conventional chiral $d$-wave pairing, accommodating one-dimensional
Majorana edge modes. Our work not only reveals a unique mechanism of
time-reversal symmetry breaking second-order topological superconductors but
also bridges the gap between second-order topology and orbital-dependent
pairings.

Recent experimental breakthroughs, particularly for single-qubit and
two-qubit gates exceeding the error correction threshold, highlight silicon
spin qubits as leading candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In
the existing architecture, intrinsic or synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is
critical in various aspects, including electrical control, addressability,
scalability, etc. However, the high-fidelity SWAP operation and quantum state
transfer (QST) between spin qubits, crucial for qubit-qubit connectivity,
require the switchable nature of SOC which is rarely considered. Here, we
propose a flexible architecture based on spin valves by electrically changing
its magnetization orientation within sub-nanoseconds to generate ultrafast
switchable SOC. Based on the switchable SOC architecture, both SWAP operation
of neighbor spin qubits and resonant QST between distant spins can be realized
with fidelity exceeding 99% while considering the realistic experimental
parameters. Benefiting from the compatible processes with the modern
semiconductor industry and experimental advances in spin valves and spin
qubits, our results pave the way for future construction of silicon-based
quantum chips.

We demonstrate the failure of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation to
describe the ground state of a quantum impurity within an ultracold Fermi gas
despite substantial mass differences between the bath and impurity species.
Increasing repulsion leads to the appearance of non-adiabatic couplings between
the fast bath and slow impurity degrees of freedom which reduce the parity
symmetry of the latter according to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect. The presence
of this mechanism is associated to a conical intersection involving the
impurity position and the inverse of the interaction strength which acts as a
synthetic dimension. We elucidate the presence of these effects via a detailed
ground state analysis involving the comparison of ab initio fully-correlated
simulations with effective models. Our study suggests ultracold atomic
ensembles as potent emulators of complex molecular phenomena.

aerosol-deposited
$0.65\text{Pb}(\text{Mg}_{1/3}\text{Nb}_{2/3})\text{O}_{3}-0.35\text{PbTiO}_{3}$
thick films on stainless-steel substrates are investigated using two
complementary methods at high and low applied external electric fields. The
first one is Positive Up Negative Down method, which allows us to obtain
information about the switching and non-switching contributions to the
polarization. It shows that the as-deposited film is ferroelectric before
annealing, since it has a switching contribution to the polarization. After
annealing, both the switching and non-switching contributions to polarization
increased by a factor of 1.6 and 2.33, respectively, indicating stronger
ferroelectric behavior. The second method is based on impedance spectroscopy
coupled with Rayleigh analysis. The results show that post-deposition thermal
annealing increases the reversible domain wall contribution to the dielectric
permittivity by a factor 11 while keeping the threshold field similar. This
indicates, after annealing, domain wall density is larger while domain wall
mobility remains similar. These two complementary characterization methods show
that annealing increases the ferroelectric behavior of the thick film by
increasing the domain wall density and its influence is visible both on
polarization versus electric field loop and dielectric permittivity.

In this review, we present the encounter-based approach to target search
problems, in which the diffusive dynamics is described by the joint probability
of the position of the particle and the number of its encounters with a given
target set. The knowledge of the statistics of encounters allows one to
implement various mechanisms of reactions on the target set, beyond
conventional reaction schemes. We formulate this approach for three relevant
settings: discrete random walks, Brownian motion with bulk reactions, and
reflected Brownian motion with surface reactions. In all cases, we discuss the
advantages of this approach, its recent applications and possible extensions.

The development of new materials is a core aspect of advancement in synthesis
and application for industry. There is a vast number of possible chemical
permutations of the basic elements that can be explored to synthesize materials
that possess attractive catalytic, mechanical and electrical properties that
may not be easily accessible to traditional experimental methods for various
reasons, including cost and time considerations. Nitrides, as examples, require
very stringent and precise conditions to successfully synthesize making their
experimental exploration very slow. In this paper, we employ the use of machine
learning algorithms to predict the bulk properties of Ternary Metal Nitrides
(TMN), specifically their bulk modulus which is correlated with the hardness of
the material. We were able to develop a consistent model with encouraging
accuracy, that was able to predict the bulk moduli of materials that previously
did not have computed values. The model was trained on $10^3$ ternary materials
with known elastic properties and defined structures, and was able to predict
the bulk modulus of $\thickapprox 1,000$ Ternary Metal Nitrides (TMNs) to
$\thickapprox 80\%$ accuracy. This approach is orders of magnitude faster than
the traditional computational approaches like density functional theory
(DFT)\cite{dft-paper} which makes exploratory identification of materials with
promising properties fast. We propose that such models be used to select
interesting candidates for high throughput computation from first principles.

Recently, the two-site Kitaev model hosting Majorana edge states was
experimentally realized based on double quantum dots. In this context, we
construct two-band effective models describing Majorana edge states of a
finite-length Kitaev chain by using the isospectral matrix reduction method. We
analytically estimate the robustness of Majorana edge states as a function of
model parameters. We also study effects of coupling to an environment based on
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians derived from the Lindblad equation. We study three
types of dissipation, a local one, an adjacent one and a global one. It is
found that the Majorana zero-energy edge states acquire nonzero energy such as
$E\propto \pm \left( i\gamma \right) ^{L}$ for the local dissipation, where
$\gamma $ is the magnitude of the dissipation and $L$ is the length of the
chain. On the other hand, the Majorana zero-energy edge states acquire nonzero
energy such as $E\propto \pm i\gamma $ irrespective of the length $L$ for the
global dissipation. Hence, the Majorana edge states are robust against the
local dissipation but not against the global one. Our results will be useful
for future studies on Majorana edge states based on quantum dots.

A paramagnetic, Gallium interstitial defect (Ga$_{\textrm{i}}$) is thought to
be responsible for a spectacular effect known as spin-dependent recombination
(SDR) in dilute nitride semiconductors of the form GaAs$_{1-x}$N$_x$. Based on
the magnitude and excitation power dependence of the SDR, it is widely accepted
that this defect results in two deep levels within the gap corresponding to the
(+/0) and (++/+) charge-state transitions. Using a novel form of photo-induced
current transient spectroscopy that exploits the optical selection rules for
band-to-band absorption of circularly polarized light, the deep-level
electronic structure of an alloy with $x$ = 0.021 is revealed. The (+/0) state
lies $\approx$ 0.27 eV below the conduction band edge, and an anomalous,
negative activation energy reveals the presence of not one but $two$ other
states within the gap. The experimental observations are consistent with a
(++/+) state lying $\approx$ 0.13 eV above the valence band edge, and a
hitherto ignored, acceptor-like (+++/++) state lying approximately within
$k_BT$ = 25 meV of the valence band edge. These observations can inform future
efforts to improve current models, both of the unusual spin-dependent charge
dynamics occurring at these centers, and of the local chemical environment of
the Ga$_{\textrm{i}}$ defect.

We report the valence-to-core resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) of
EuS measured at the L3 edge of Eu. The obtained data reveal two sets of
excitations: one set is composed of a hole in the S 3p bands and an electron
excited to extended Eu 5d band states, the other is made up from a hole in the
Eu 4f states and an electron in localized Eu 5d states bound to the 4f hole by
its Coulomb potential. The delocalized excitations arise from the
dipole-allowed 5d to 2p emissions, whereas the localized excitations result
from the dipole-forbidden (quadrupole-allowed) 4f to 2p emissions. Both these
emission channels have a comparable intensity thanks to a small number of
occupied 5d states (approximately 0.6) combined with a large number of occupied
4f states (seven). We identify the localized electron-hole pairs with the
"magnetic excitons" suggested in the past as an interpretation of the sharp
features seen in the optical absorption spectra. Our observations provide a
direct experimental evidence of these excitons which has been missing up to
now.

Three-dimensional dislocation networks control the mechanical properties such

and their temporal evolution, analysis tools are needed that fully resolve the
dynamic processes of the intrinsic dislocation graph structure. We propose the
use of a graph database for the analysis of three-dimensional dislocation
networks obtained from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. This makes it
possible to extract (sub-)graphs and their features with relative ease. That
allows for a more holistic view of the evolution of dislocation networks and
for the extraction of homogenized graph features to be incorporated into
continuum formulation. As an illustration, we describe the static and dynamic
analysis of spatio-temporal dislocation graphs as well as graph feature
analysis.

Interconnect materials with ultralow dielectric constant, and good thermal
and mechanical properties are crucial for the further miniaturization of
electronic devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that ultrathin amorphous
boron nitride (aBN) films have a very low dielectric constant, high density
(above 2.1 g/cm3), high thermal stability, and mechanical properties. The
excellent properties of aBN derive from the nature and degree of disorder,
which can be controlled at fabrication, allowing tuning of the physical
properties for desired applications. Here, we report an improvement in the
stability and mechanical properties of amorphous boron nitride upon hydrogen
doping. With the introduction of a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for
atomistic simulations, we investigate the changing morphology of amorphous
boron nitride with varying H doping concentrations. We found that for 8 at% of
H doping, the concentration of $sp^3$-hybridized atoms reaches a maximum which
leads to an improvement of thermal stability and mechanical properties by 20%.
These results will be a guideline for experimentalists and process engineers to
tune the growth conditions of amorphous boron nitride films for numerous
applications.

possible transition paths to the bcc ground state structure and the energy
landscape for tetragonal distortions. Furthermore, we discuss their stability
by means of their phonon spectra and vibronic free energies. Second we analyze
the impact of tantalum impurities on phase stability. Surprisingly we find new
aspects of the energy landscape of the material which have been overlooked so
far: A new local energy minimum on the bcc to omega transition path, a flat
energy landscape with respect to uniaxial strain along [111] and a considerable
stabilization of the sigma phase by Ta substitution.

The nature of correlation-driven metal-insulator transitions remains a
longstanding puzzle in solid-state physics. While some theories suggest a
second-order character, various experimental observations in these materials
indicate first-order phase transitions. Despite considerable progress over the
last decades in understanding the underlying driving mechanisms of
metal-insulator transitions, in particular the phase coexistence remains poorly
understood on a microscopic scale. Here, we employ Mueller matrix spectroscopic
and temperature-dependent ellipsometry to determine the anisotropic dielectric
functions of the two-dimensional charge-transfer salt
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ across its charge-order metal-insulator
transition. Our results offer valuable insights into temperature-dependent
changes of the dielectric functions along the different crystallographic axes.
Furthermore, we apply an effective-medium approximation to quantify the
correlation between the metal-to-insulator transition and the volume fraction
of the metallic phase embedded within the insulating phase. Through this
comprehensive approach, generalized ellipsometry unravels the nature of the
correlation-driven metal-insulator transition.

Heat engines are key devices that convert thermal energy into usable energy.
Strong thermoelectricity, at the basis of electrical heat engines, is present
in superconducting spin tunnel barriers at cryogenic temperatures where
conventional semiconducting or metallic technologies cease to work. Here we
realize a superconducting spintronic heat engine consisting of a ferromagnetic
insulator/superconductor/insulator/ferromagnet tunnel junction
(EuS/Al/AlO$_x$/Co). The efficiency of the engine is quantified for bath
temperatures ranging from 25 mK up to 800 mK, and at different load
resistances. Moreover, we show that the sign of the generated thermoelectric
voltage can be inverted according to the parallel or anti-parallel orientation
of the two ferromagnetic layers, EuS and Co. This realizes a thermoelectric
spin valve controlling the sign and strength of the Seebeck coefficient,
thereby implementing a thermoelectric memory cell. We propose a theoretical
model that allows describing the experimental data and predicts the engine
efficiency for different device parameters.

Topological superconductivity emerges in chains or arrays of magnetic atoms

radical molecules on Pb(111), whose discharge is controlled by the tip of a
scanning tunneling microscope. Charged molecules carry a spin-1/2 state, as
confirmed by observing Yu-Shiba-Rusinov in-gap states by tunneling spectroscopy
at millikelvin temperature. Low energy modes are localized at island boundaries
with a long decay towards the interior, whose spectral signature is consistent
with Majorana zero modes protected by mirror symmetry. Our results open up a

Engineering heterostructures with various types of quantum materials can
provide an intriguing playground for studying exotic physics induced by
proximity effect. Here, we report the successful synthesis of iron-based
superconductor FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ (FST) thin films in the entire composition
of $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and its heterostructure with a magnetic topological
insulator by using molecular beam epitaxy. Superconductivity is observed in the
FST films with an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ $\sim$
12 K at around x = 0.1. We found that superconductivity survives in the very
Te-rich films ($x \leq 0.05$), showing stark contrast to bulk crystals with
suppression of superconductivity due to an appearance of bicollinear
antiferromagnetism accompanied by monoclinic structural transition. By
examining thickness t dependence on electrical transport properties, we
observed strong suppression of the structural transition in films below t
$\sim$ 100 nm, suggesting that substrate effects may stabilize superconducting
phase near the interface. Furthermore, we fabricated all chalcogenide-based
heterointerface between FST and magnetic topological insulator
(Cr,Bi,Sb)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ for the first time, observing both superconductivity
and large anomalous Hall conductivity. The anomalous Hall conductivity
increases with decreasing temperature, approaching to the quantized value of
$e^2/h$ down to the measurable minimum temperature at $T_c$. The result
suggests coexistence of magnetic and superconducting gaps at low temperatures
opening at the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. Our novel magnetic
topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure could be an ideal platform
to explore chiral Majorana edge mode.

We consider the spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions with contact attraction near the
SU(4)-symmetric limit of vanishing Luttinger parameter responsible for band
inversion, and at finite chemical potential. In the case of exact SU(4)
symmetry the previously considered s-wave and five d-wave superconducting order
parameters together form a six-dimensional irreducible representation which
transforms as an antisymmetric tensor under SU(4). In this limit, we find the
SU(4) ($\simeq$ SO(6)) symmetry to be spontaneously broken down to SO(5) at the
superconducting transition. When the SU(4) is reduced to SO(3) by the weak
band-inversion kinetic energy term, we show that at low temperatures the
superconducting state is $is+d$, with a dominant $s$ and a small $d$ component,
and spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry. Relevance to superconductivity
in doped semiconductors with diamond structure is discussed.

<h3>Time evolution of entanglement entropy after quenches in two-dimensional  free fermion systems: a dimensional reduction treatment</h3>

<i>Shion Yamashika, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the time evolution of the R\'enyi entanglement entropies following a
quantum quench in a two-dimensional (2D) free-fermion system. By employing
dimensional reduction, we effectively transform the 2D problem into decoupled
chains, a technique applicable when the system exhibits translational
invariance in one direction. Various initial configurations are examined,
revealing that the behavior of entanglement entropies can often be explained by
adapting the one-dimensional quasiparticle picture. However, intriguingly, for
specific initial states the entanglement entropy saturates to a finite value
without the reduced density matrix converging to a stationary state. We discuss
the conditions necessary for a stationary state to exist and delve into the
necessary modifications to the quasiparticle picture when such a state is
absent.

<h3>Effect of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in spin dynamics  of an Antiferromagnet coupled Ferromagnetic double-barrier Magnetic Tunnel  Junction</h3>

<i>Reeta Devi, Nimisha Dutta, Arindam Boruah, Saumen Acharjee</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we have studied the spin dynamics of a synthethic
Antiferromagnet (SAFM)$|$Heavy Metal (HM)$|$Ferromagnet (FM) double barrier
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) in presence of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoside
interaction (RKKYI), interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI),
N\'eel field and Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) with different Spin Transfer Torque
(STT). We employ Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation to
investigate the AFM dynamics of the proposed system. We found that the system
exhibits a transition from regular to damped oscillations with the increase in
strength of STT for systems with weaker iDMI than RKKYI while display sustained
oscillatons for system having same order of iDMI and RKKYI. On the other hand
the iDMI dominating system exhibits self-similar but aperiodic patterns in
absence of N\'eel field. In the presence of N\'eel field, the RKKYI dominating
systems exhibit chaotic oscillations for low STT but display sustained
oscillation under moderate STT. Our results suggest that the decay time of
oscillations can be controlled via SOC. The system can works as an oscillator
for low SOC but display nonlinear characteristics with the rise in SOC for
systems having weaker iDMI than RKKYI while an opposite characteristic are
noticed for iDMI dominating systems. We found periodic oscillations under low
external magnetic field in RKKYI dominating systems while moderate field are
necessary for sustained oscillation in iDMI dominating systems. Moreover, the
system exhibits saddle-node bifurcation and chaos under moderate N\'eel field
and SOC with suitable iDMI and RKKYI. In addition, our results indicate that
the magnon lifetime can be enhanced by increasing the strength of iDMI for both
optical and acoustic modes.

The physics of impurities in a bosonic quantum environment is a paradigmatic
and challenging many-body problem that remains to be understood in its full
complexity. Here, this problem is investigated for impurities with strong
repulsive interactions based on Ramsey interferometry in a quantum degenerate
gas of 39K atoms. We observe an oscillatory signal that is consistent with a
quantum beat between two co-existing coherent quasiparticle states: the
attractive and repulsive polarons. The interferometric signal allows us to
extract the polaron energies for a wide range of interaction strengths,
complimenting earlier spectroscopic measurements. We furthermore identify
several dynamical regimes towards the formation of the Bose polaron in good
agreement with theory. Our results improve the understanding of quantum
impurities interacting strongly with a bosonic environment, and demonstrate how
quasiparticles as well as short-lived non-equilibrium many-body states can be
probed using Ramsey interferometry.

<br>
<br>
The spin-reversal in dilute Li$_2$(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)N with $x < 1$ % is
dominated by resonant quantum tunneling of spatially well-separated states. We
report on the effect of finite couplings between those states that give rise to
cooperative, simultaneous quantum tunneling of two spins. This phenomenon,
known as spin-spin cross relaxation, effectively elucidates the fine-structure
observed in isothermal magnetization loops, a previously unresolved aspect.
Temperature and field-dependent magnetization measurements were conducted over
a range from T = 2 K to 300 K in applied fields of up to $\mu_0H$ = 7 T.
Magnetic dipole fields are computed numerically. Our findings affirm the
absence of stoichiometric defects in Li$_2$(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)N and underscore
its exemplary suitability as a model system for investigating spin-reversal
processes at the microscopic level. This is attributed to its comparatively
simple crystal structure, the availability of large single crystals, elevated
characteristic energies, and well-defined energy levels

Accurate thermodynamic stability predictions enable data-driven computational
materials design. Standard density functional theory (DFT) approximations have
limited accuracy with average errors of a few hundred meV/atom for ionic
materials such as oxides and nitrides. Thus, insightful correction schemes as
given by the coordination corrected enthalpies (CCE) method, based on an
intuitive parameterization of DFT errors with respect to coordination numbers
and cation oxidation states present a simple, yet accurate solution to enable
materials stability assessments. Here, we illustrate the computational
capabilities of our AFLOW-CCE software by utilizing our previous results for
oxides and introducing new results for nitrides. The implementation reduces the
deviations between theory and experiment to the order of the room temperature
thermal energy scale, i.e. ~25 meV/atom. The automated corrections for both
materials classes are freely available within the AFLOW ecosystem via the
AFLOW-CCE module, requiring only structural inputs.

Thin-film photovoltaics offers a path to significantly decarbonize our energy
production. Unfortunately, current materials commercialized or under
development as thin-film solar cell absorbers are far from optimal as they show
either low power conversion efficiency or issues with earth-abundance and
stability. Entirely new and disruptive materials platforms are rarely
discovered as the search for new solar absorbers is traditionally slow and
serendipitous. Here, we use first principles high-throughput screening to
accelerate this process. We identify new solar absorbers among known inorganic
compounds using considerations on band gap, carrier transport, optical
absorption but also on intrinsic defects which can strongly limit the carrier
lifetime and ultimately the solar cell efficiency. Screening about 40,000
materials, we discover the Zintl-phosphide BaCd$_{2}$P$_{2}$ as a potential
high-efficiency solar absorber. Follow-up experimental work confirms the
predicted promises of BaCd$_{2}$P$_{2}$ highlighting an optimal band gap for
visible absorption, bright photoluminescence, and long carrier lifetime of up
to 30 ns even for unoptimized powder samples. Importantly, BaCd$_{2}$P$_{2}$
does not contain any critical elements and is highly stable in air and water.
Our work opens an avenue for a new family of stable, earth-abundant,
high-performance Zintl-based solar absorbers. It also demonstrates how recent
advances in first principles computation can accelerate the search of
photovoltaic materials by combining high-throughput screening with experiment.

<h3>Theory and optimisation of radiative recombination in broken-gap  InAs/GaSb superlattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Cónal Murphy, Eoin P. O'Reilly, Christopher A. Broderick</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical analysis of mid-infrared radiative recombination in
InAs/GaSb superlattices (SLs). We employ a semi-analytical plane wave expansion
method in conjunction with an 8-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian
to compute the SL electronic structure, paying careful attention to the
identification and mitigation of spurious solutions. The calculated SL
eigenstates are used directly to compute spontaneous emission spectra and the
radiative recombination coefficient $B$. We elucidate the origin of the
relatively large $B$ coefficients in InAs/GaSb SLs which, despite the presence
of spatially indirect (type-II-like) carrier confinement, are close to that of
bulk InAs and compare favourably to those calculated for mid-infrared type-I
pseudomorphic and metamorphic quantum well structures having comparable
emission wavelengths. Our analysis explicitly quantifies the roles played by
carrier localisation (specifically, partial delocalisation of bound electron
states) and miniband formation (specifically, miniband occupation and optical
selection rules) in determining the magnitude of $B$ and its temperature
dependence. We perform a high-throughput optimisation of the room temperature
$B$ coefficient in InAs/GaSb SLs across the 3.5 -- 7 $\mu$m wavelength range,
quantifying the dependence of $B$ on the relative thickness of the
electron-confining InAs and hole-confining GaSb layers. This analysis provides
guidance for the growth of optimised SLs for mid-infrared light emitters. Our
results, combined with the expected low non-radiative Auger recombination rates
in structures having spatially indirect electron and hole confinement,
corroborate recently observed high output power in prototype InAs/GaSb SL
inter-band cascade light-emitting diodes.

<h3>Nature of the photo-induced metallic state in monoclinic VO$_2$</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The metal-insulator transition of VO$_2$, which in equilibrium is associated
with a structural phase transition, has been intensively studied for decades.
In particular, it is challenging to disentangle the role of Mott physics from
dimerization effects in the insulating phase. Femtosecond time-resolved
experiments showed that optical excitations can induce a transient metallic
state in the dimerized phase, which is distinct from the known equilibrium
phases. In this study, we combine non-equilibrium cluster dynamical mean-field
theory with realistic first principles modeling to clarify the nature of this
laser-induced metallic state. We show that the doublon-holon production by
laser pulses with polarization along the V-V dimers and the subsequent
inter-orbital reshuffling of the photo-carriers leads to a population of
orbital-mixed states and the filling of the gap. The photo-induced metal state
is qualitatively similar to a hot electronic state in the dimerized structure,
and does not involve a collapse of the Mott gap.

X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) are the most advanced pulsed x-ray sources.
Their extraordinary pulse parameters promise unique applications. Indeed,
several new methods have been developed at XFEL-s. However, no methods are
known, which would allow ab initio atomic level structure determination using
only a single XFEL pulse. Here, we present experimental results, demonstrating
the determination of the 3D atomic structure from data obtained during a single
25 fs XFEL pulse. Parallel measurement of hundreds of Bragg reflections was
done by collecting Kossel line patterns of GaAs and GaP. With these
measurements, we reached the ultimate temporal limit of the x-ray structure
solution possible today. These measurements open the way for studying
non-repeatable fast processes and structural transformations in crystals for
example measuring the atomic structure of matter at extremely non-ambient
conditions or transient structures formed in irreversible physical, chemical,
or biological processes. It would also facilitate time resolved pump-probe
structural studies making them significantly shorter than traditional serial
crystallography.

Fermionic atoms in optical lattices have served as a compelling model system
to study and emulate the physics of strongly-correlated matter. Driven by the
advances of high-resolution microscopy, the recent focus of research has been
on two-dimensional systems in which several quantum phases, such as
anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulators for repulsive interactions and
charge-density waves for attractive interactions have been observed. However,
the aspired emulations of real materials, such as bilayer graphene, have to
take into account that their lattice structure composes of coupled layers and
therefore is not strictly two-dimensional. In this work, we realize a bilayer
Fermi-Hubbard model using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice and demonstrate
that the interlayer coupling controls a crossover between a planar
anti-ferromagnetically ordered Mott insulator and a band insulator of
spin-singlets along the bonds between the layers. Our work will enable the
exploration of further fascinating properties of coupled-layer Hubbard models,
such as theoretically predicted superconducting pairing mechanisms.

<br>
<br>
As a simplified description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of buckled dimers
on the Si(001) surface, we consider the anisotropic 2D Ising model and study
the freezing of spatial correlations during a cooling quench across the
critical point. The dependence of the frozen correlation lengths $\xi_\|$ and
$\xi_\perp$ on the cooling rate obtained numerically matches the Kibble-Zurek
scaling quite well. However, we also find that the ratio $\xi_\|/\xi_\perp$ of
their frozen values deviates significantly from the ratio in equilibrium.
Supported by analytical arguments, we explain this difference by the fact that
the deviation from equilibrium in the weakly coupled direction occurs earlier
than in the strongly coupled direction.

<br>
<br>
The parallel stripe phase is remarkable both in its own right, and in
relation to the other phases it co-exists with. Its inhomogeneous nature makes
such states susceptible to random fields from quenched magnetic vacancies. We
argue this is the case by introducing low concentrations of nonmagnetic Zn
impurities (0-10%) into La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (Nd-LSCO) with $x$
= 0.125 in single crystal form, well below the percolation threshold of $\sim$
41% for two-dimensional (2D) square lattice. Elastic neutron scattering
measurements on these crystals show clear magnetic quasi-Bragg peaks at all Zn
dopings. While all the Zn-doped crystals display order parameters that merge
into each other and the background at $\sim$ 68 K, the temperature dependence
of the order parameter as a function of Zn concentration is drastically
different. This result is consistent with meandering charge stripes within the
parallel stripe phase, which are pinned in the presence of quenched magnetic
vacancies. In turn it implies vacancies that preferentially occupy sites within
the charge stripes, and hence that can be very effective at disrupting
superconductivity in Nd-LSCO ($x$ = 0.125), and, by extension, in all systems
exhibiting parallel stripes.

We present the Python package CELL, which provides a modular approach to the

systems, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional alloys, in a general

complex materials comprising several atoms in their parent lattice. CELL uses
state-of-the-art techniques for the construction of training data sets, model
selection, and finite-temperature simulations. The user interface consists of
well-documented Python classes and modules
(this http URL). CELL also provides visualization
utilities and can be interfaced with virtually any ab initio package,
total-energy codes based on interatomic potentials, and more. The usage and
capabilities of CELL are illustrated by a number of examples, comprising a
Cu-Pt surface alloy with oxygen adsorption, featuring two coupled binary
sublattices, and the thermodynamic analysis of its order-disorder transition;
the demixing transition and lattice-constant bowing of the Si-Ge alloy; and an

The relevant length scales for superconductivity are of the order of
nanometers. By confining the superconducting condensate to such dimensions,
many physical properties change substantially, and novel phenomena emerge,
which are absent in the pristine material. We discuss various methods of
creating artificial nanostructures by top-down approaches in metallic and
copper-oxide superconductors and their applications. Such nanostructures can be
used to control magnetic flux quanta in superconductors, anchoring them to
engineered defects to avoid dissipation, guiding their motion, or building
artificial flux-quanta arrangements. Nanopatterned superconductors are
essential for creating model systems for basic research and enable building
almost dissipationless and ultrafast electronic devices and highly sensitive
sensors.

Using first-principle calculations, we investigate the electronic,
topological and superconducting properties of Nb$_3$X (X = Ge, Sn, Sb) and
Ta$_3$Y (Y = As, Sb, Bi) A15 compounds. We demonstrate that these compounds
host Dirac surface states which are related to a nontrivial Z$_2$ topological
value. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splits the eightfold degenerate R point
close to the Fermi level enhancing the amplitude of the spin Hall conductance.
Indeed, despite the moderate spin-orbit of the Nb-compounds, a large spin Hall
effect is also obtained in Nb$_3$Ge and Nb$_3$Sn compounds. We show that the
Coulomb interaction opens the gap at the R point thus making more evident the
occurrence of Dirac surface states. We then investigate the superconducting
properties by determining the strength of the electron-phonon BCS coupling. The
evolution of the critical temperature is tracked down to the 2D limit
indicating a reduction of the transition temperature which mainly arises from
the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. Finally, we
propose a minimal tight-binding model based on three coupled
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with t$_{2g}$ Ta- and Nb-orbitals reproducing the
spin-orbit splittings at the R point among the $\pi$-bond bands in this class
of compounds. We separate the kinetic parameters in $\pi$ and $\delta$-bonds,
in intradimer and interdimer hoppings and discuss their relevance for the
topological electronic structure. We point out that Nb$_3$Ge might represent a
Z$_2$ topological metal with the highest superconducting temperature ever
recorded.

<br>
<br>
Van Vleck modes describe all possible displacements of
octahedrally-coordinated ligands about a core atom. They are a useful
analytical tool for analysing the distortion of octahedra, particularly for the
first-order Jahn-Teller distortion. Determination of Van Vleck modes of an
octahedron is complicated by the presence of angular distortion of octahedra
however. This problem is most commonly resolved by calculating the bond
distortion modes ($Q_2$, $Q_3$) along the bond axes of the octahedron,
disregarding the angular distortion and losing information on the octahedral
shear modes ($Q_4$, $Q_5$, and $Q_6$) in the process. In this paper, the
validity of assuming bond lengths to be orthogonal in order to calculate the
van Vleck modes is discussed, and a method is described for calculating Van
Vleck modes without disregarding the angular distortion. A Python code for
doing this, VanVleckCalculator, is introduced, and some examples of its use are
given. Finally, we show that octahedral shear and angular distortion are often,
but not always, correlated, and propose a parameter as the shear fraction,
$\eta$. We demonstrate that $\eta$ can be used to predict whether the values
will be correlated when varying a tuning parameter such as temperature or
pressure.

Symmetry and non-Hermiticity play pivotal roles in photonic lattices. While
symmetries such as parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry have attracted ample
attention, more intricate crystalline symmetries have been neglected in
comparison.
Here, we investigate the impact of the 17 wallpaper space groups of
two-dimensional crystals on non-Hermitian band structures. We show that the
non-trivial space group representations enforce degeneracies at high symmetry
points and dictate their dispersion away from these points. In combination with
either $\mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{PT}$, the symmorphic p4mm symmetry, as well
as the non-symmorphic p2mg, p2gg, and p4gm symmetries, protect novel
exceptional chains intersecting at the pertinent high symmetry points.

We propose an exact analytical decimation transformation scheme to explore
the fascinating coexistence of flat bands and Dirac fermions in
three-dimensional coupled kagome systems. Our method allows coarse-graining of
the parameter space that maps the original system to an equivalent low-level
lattice. The decimated system enables defining a quantity in the tight-binding
parameter space that predominantly controls the emergence of a flat band (FB)
and provides a specific criterion for absolute flatness. Likewise, in terms of
atomic separations, we develop a quantity that primarily controls the FB width
in real materials and thus can be helpful in predicting new systems hosting FB
as well as in tuning the FB width. Our predictions on the emergence of the flat
band and Dirac fermions are confirmed for M$_3$X (M= Ni, Mn, Co, Fe; X= Al, Ga,
In, Sn, Cr,...) family of materials, leveraging materials databases and
first-principles calculations. Our work provides an analytical formalism that
enables accurate predictions of FBs in real materials.

Recent ultrafast photoemission experiments showed signatures of an ultrafast

$10.5\,\text{ps}$, we eliminate hot electrons and see that the nucleation of FM
domains still proceeds at the intrinsic timescale of $8\,\text{ps}$, which
starts when the deposited energy surpasses the threshold energy. For long
pulses, the phase transition proceeds considerably faster than predicted by a
convolution of the dynamics observed for ultrafast excitation with the long
pump pulse duration. We predict that quite generally, slow photoexcitation can
result in a fast response, if the non-linear threshold behavior of a
first-order phase transition is involved.

Optical absorption in rhombohedral BiFeO$_3$ starts at photon energies below
the photoemission band gap of $\approx$ 3 eV calculated from first principles.
A shoulder at the absorption onset has so far been attributed to low-lying
electronic transitions or to oxygen vacancies. In this work optical spectra are
calculated ab initio to determine the nature of the optical transitions near
the absorption onset of pristine BiFeO$_3$, the effect of electron-hole
interaction, and the spectroscopic signatures of typical defects, i.e. doping
(excess electrons or holes), intrinsic defects (oxygen and bismuth vacancies),
and low-energy structural defects (ferroelectric domain walls).

Modern hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction arrays are a
promising platform for analog quantum simulations. Their controllable and
non-sinusoidal energy/phase relation opens the path to implement nontrivial
interactions and study the emergence of exotic quantum phase transitions. Here,
we propose the analysis of an array of hybrid Josephson junctions defining a
two-leg ladder geometry for the quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising
phase transition. This transition provides the paradigmatic example of minimal
conformal models beyond Ising criticality and its excitations are intimately
related with Fibonacci non-Abelian anyons and topological order in two
dimensions. We study this superconducting system and its thermodynamic phases
based on bosonization and matrix-product-states techniques. Its effective
continuous description in terms of a three-frequency sine-Gordon quantum field
theory suggests the presence of the targeted tricritical point and the analysis
of order parameters and correlation lengths confirm this picture. Our results
indicate which experimental observables can be adopted in realistic devices to
probe the physics and the phase transitions of the model. Additionally, our
proposal provides a useful one-dimensional building block to design
two-dimensional scalable Josephson junction arrays with exotic topological
order.

We have carried out a search for a pair density wave signature using
high-energy X-ray diffraction in fields up to 16 T. We do not see evidence for
a signal at the predicted wavevector. This is a report on the details of our
experiment, with information on where in reciprocal space we looked.
