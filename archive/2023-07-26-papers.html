<h3>Energy Spectrum Analysis on a Red Blood Cell Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14029" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14029</a>

It is important to understand the dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) in blood
flow. This requires the formulation of coarse-grained RBC models that reproduce
the hydrodynamic properties of blood accurately. One of the models that
successfully reproduce the rheology and morphology of blood has been proposed
by Fedosov et al. [D. A. Fedosov, B. Caswell, and G. E. Karniadakis, Comput.
Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., Vol. 199, 1937-1948 (2010)]. The proposed RBC model
contains several parameters whose values are determined either by various
experiments or physical requirements. In this study, we developed a new method
of determining the parameter values precisely from the fluctuations of the RBC
membrane. Specifically, we studied the relationship between the spectra of the
fluctuations and model parameters. Characteristic peaks were observed in the
spectra, whose peak frequencies were dependent on the parameter values. In
addition, we investigated the spectra of the radius of gyration. We identified
the peaks originating from the spring potential and the volume-conserving
potential appearing in the spectra. These results lead to the precise
experimental determination of the parameters used in the RBC model.

<h3>Lagrangian statistics of dense emulsions</h3>

The dynamics of dense stabilized emulsions presents a rich phenomenology
including chaotic emulsification, non-Newtonian rheology and ageing dynamics at
rest. Macroscopic rheology results from the complex droplet microdynamics and,
in turn, droplet dynamics is influenced by macroscopic flows via the competing
action of hydrodynamic and interfacial stresses, giving rise to a complex
tangle of elastoplastic effects, diffusion, breakups and coalescence events.
This tight multiscale coupling, together with the daunting challenge of
experimentally investigating droplets under flow, hindered the understanding of
dense emulsions dynamics. We present results from 3D numerical simulations of
dense stabilised emulsions, resolving the shape and dynamics of individual
droplets, along with the macroscopic flows. We investigate droplet dispersion
statistics, measuring probability density functions (PDF) of droplet
displacements and velocities, changing the concentration, in the stirred and
ageing regimes. We provide the first measurements ever, in concentrated
emulsions, of the relative droplet-droplet separations PDF and of the droplet
acceleration PDF, which becomes strongly non-Gaussian as the volume fraction is
increased above the jamming point. Cooperative effects, arising when droplets
are in contact, are argued to be responsible of the anomalous superdiffusive
behaviour of the mean square displacement and of the pair separation at long
times, in both the stirred and in the ageing regimes. This superdiffusive
behaviour is reflected in a non-Gaussian pair separation PDF, whose analytical
form is investigated, in the ageing regime, by means of theoretical arguments.
This work paves the way to developing a connection between Lagrangian dynamics
and rheology in dense stabilised emulsions.

<h3>Robust Training of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with  Dimensionality Reduction and Stratified Sampling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13710" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13710</a>

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable the accurate
simulation of materials at larger sizes and time scales, and play increasingly
important roles in the computational understanding and design of materials.
However, MLIPs are only as accurate and robust as the data they are trained on.
In this work, we present DImensionality-Reduced Encoded Clusters with
sTratified (DIRECT) sampling as an approach to select a robust training set of
structures from a large and complex configuration space. By applying DIRECT
sampling on the Materials Project relaxation trajectories dataset with over one
million structures and 89 elements, we develop an improved materials 3-body
graph network (M3GNet) universal potential that extrapolate more reliably to
unseen structures. We further show that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
with universal potentials such as M3GNet can be used in place of expensive
\textit{ab initio} MD to rapidly create a large configuration space for target
materials systems. Combined with DIRECT sampling, we develop a highly reliable
moment tensor potential for Ti-H system without the need for iterative
optimization. This work paves the way towards robust high throughput
development of MLIPs across any compositional complexity.

<h3>Unconventional spin transport in strongly correlated kagome systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13725</a>
<br>
<i>Masataka Kawano, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent progress in material design enables the study of correlated,
low-temperature phases and associated anomalous transport in two-dimensional
kagome systems. Here, we show that unconventional spin transport can arise in
such systems even at elevated temperatures due to emergent dynamical
constraints. To demonstrate this effect, we consider a strong-coupling limit of
an extended Hubbard model on the kagome lattice with 2/3 filling. We
numerically investigate the charge and spin transport by employing a cellular
automaton circuit. The charge dynamics reflects the constraints and can be
understood by a Gaussian field theory of a scalar height field. Moreover, the
system exhibits a hidden spin conservation law with a dynamic sublattice
structure, which enables additional slow relaxation pathways for spin
excitations. These features can be directly tested by measuring the dynamic
spin structure factor with neutron scattering.

<h3>Strange-metal behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ beyond the  stripe-percolation transition</h3>

The nature of the normal state of cuprate superconductors continues to
stimulate considerable speculation. Of particular interest has been the linear
temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity in the low-temperature
limit, which violates the prediction for a Fermi liquid. We present evidence
that the behavior is a consequence of an inhomogeneous mixture of
quasiparticles and strongly-correlated patches of spin and charge stripes. In
the case of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, the strange-metal behavior is observed
only for doped-hole concentrations that exceed the percolation threshold for
stripe correlations, where we observe that the resistivity measured
perpendicular to the planes develops a metallic temperature dependence.

<h3>Phase transition in the Galam's majority-rule model with  information-mediated independence</h3>

<br>
<i>André L. Oestereich, Marcelo A. Pires, Silvio M. Duarte Queirós, Nuno Crokidakis</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the Galam's majority-rule model in the presence of an independent
behavior that can be driven intrinsically or can be mediated by information
regarding the collective opinion of the whole population. We first apply the
mean-field approach where we obtained an explicit time-dependent solution for
the order parameter of the model. We complement our results with Monte Carlo
simulations where our findings indicate that independent opinion leads to
order-disorder continuous nonequilibrium phase transitions. Finite-size scaling
analysis show that the model belongs to the mean-field Ising model universality
class. Moreover, results from an approach with the Kramers-Moyal coefficients
provide insights about the social volatility.

<h3>Thermal form-factor expansion of the dynamical two-point functions of  local operators in integrable quantum chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13789" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13789</a>

<br>
Evaluating a lattice path integral in terms of spectral data and matrix
elements of a suitably defined quantum transfer matrix, we derive form-factor
series expansions for the dynamical two-point functions of arbitrary local
operators in fundamental Yang-Baxter integrable lattice models at finite
temperature. The summands in the series are parameterised by solutions of the
Bethe Ansatz equations associated with the eigenvalue problem of the quantum
transfer matrix. We elaborate on the example of the XXZ chain for which the
solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations are sufficiently well understood in
certain limiting cases. We work out in detail the case of the spin-zero
operators in the antiferromagnetic massive regime at zero temperature. In this
case the thermal form-factor series turn into series of multiple integrals with
fully explicit integrands. These integrands factorize into an
operator-dependent part, determined by the so-called Fermionic basis, and a
part which we call the universal weight as it is the same for all spin-zero
operators. The universal weight can be inferred from our previous work. The
operator-dependent part is rather simple for the most interesting short-range
operators. It is determined by two functions $\rho$ and $\omega$ for which we
obtain explicit expressions in the considered case. As an application we
rederive the known explicit form-factor series for the two-point function of
the magnetization operator and obtain analogous expressions for the magnetic
current and the energy operators.

<h3>Unconventional charge-density-wave gap in monolayer NbS$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, for a monolayer of
transition metal dichalcogenide H-NbS$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on
graphene, we provide unambiguous evidence for a charge density wave (CDW) with
a 3$\times$3 superstructure, which is not present in bulk NbS$_2$. Local
spectroscopy displays a pronounced gap of the order of 20 meV at the Fermi
level. Within the gap low energy features are present. The gap structure with
its low energy features is at variance with the expectation for a gap opening
in the electronic band structure due to a CDW. Instead, comparison with \it{ab
initio} calculations indicates that the observed gap structure must be
attributed to combined electron-phonon quasiparticles. The phonons in question
are the elusive amplitude and phase collective modes of the CDW transition. Our
findings advance the understanding of CDW mechanisms in two dimensional
materials and their spectroscopic signatures.

<h3>Electronic transport computation in thermoelectric materials: From ab  initio scattering rates to nanostructures</h3>

Over the last two decades a plethora of new thermoelectric materials, their
alloys, and their nanostructures were synthesized. The ZT figure of merit,
which quantifies the thermoelectric efficiency of these materials increased
from values of unity to values consistently beyond two across material
families. At the same time, the ability to identify and optimize such
materials, has stressed the need for advanced numerical tools for computing
electronic transport in materials with arbitrary bandstructure complexity,
multiple scattering mechanisms, and a large degree of nanostructuring. Many
computational methods have been developed, the majority of which utilize the
Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) formalism, spanning from fully ab initio to
empirical treatment, with varying degree of computational expense and accuracy.
In this paper we describe a suitable computational process that we have
recently developed specifically for thermoelectric materials. The method
consists of three independent software packages that we have developed and: 1)
begins from ab initio calculation of the electron-phonon scattering rates, 2)
to then be used within a Boltzmann transport simulator, and 3) calculated
quantities from BTE are then passed on to a Monte Carlo simulator to examine
electronic transport in highly nanostructured material configurations. The
method we describe is computationally significantly advantageous compared to
current fully ab initio and existing Monte Carlo methods, but with a similar
degree of accuracy, thus making it truly enabling in understanding and
assessing thermoelectric transport in complex band, nanostructured materials.

<h3>Simulating the rheology of dense suspensions using pairwise formulation  of contact, lubrication and Brownian forces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13802" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13802</a>

Dense suspensions of solid particles in viscous liquid are ubiquitous in both
industry and nature, and there is a clear need for efficient numerical routines
to simulate their rheology and microstructure. Particles of micron size present
a particular challenge: at low shear rates colloidal interactions control their
dynamics while at high rates granular-like contacts dominate. While there are
established particle-based simulation schemes for large-scale non-Brownian
suspensions using only pairwise lubrication and contact forces, common schemes
for colloidal suspensions generally are more computationally costly and thus
restricted to relatively small system sizes. Here we present a minimal
particle-based numerical model for dense colloidal suspensions which
incorporates Brownian forces in pairwise form alongside contact and lubrication
forces. We show that this scheme reproduces key features of dense suspension
rheology near the collodial-to-granular transition, including both
shear-thinning due to entropic forces at low rates and shear thickening at high
rate due to contact formation. This scheme is implemented in LAMMPS, a
widely-used open source code for parallelized particle-based simulations, with
a runtime that scales linearly with the number of particles making it amenable
for large-scale simulations.

<h3>Computational Design of Anisotropic Stealthy Hyperuniform Composites  with Engineered Directional Scattering Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13833" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13833</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Disordered hyperuniform materials are an emerging class of exotic amorphous
states of matter that endow them with singular physical properties. Here, we
generalize the Fourier-space based numerical construction procedure for
designing {\it isotropic} disordered hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous
materials (i.e., composites) developed by Chen and Torquato [Acta Mater. {\bf
142}, 152 (2018)] to {\it anisotropic} microstructures by explicitly
incorporating the {\it vector-dependent} spectral density function ${\tilde
\chi}_{_V}({\bf k})$ of {\it arbitrary form} that is realizable. We demonstrate
the utility of the procedure by generating a wide spectrum of {\it anisotropic}
stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) microstructures with ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({\bf k}) =
0$ for ${\bf k} \in \Omega$. We show how different exclusion-region shapes with
various discrete symmetries and varying size affect the resulting statistically
anisotropic microstructures as a function of the and phase volume fraction. We
find that, among other properties, the directional hyperuniform behaviors
imposed by the shape asymmetry (or anisotropy) of certain exclusion regions
give rise to distinct anisotropic structures and degree of uniformity in the
distribution of the phases on intermediate and large length scales along
different directions. Moreover, while the anisotropic exclusion regions impose
strong constraints on the {\it global} symmetry of the resulting media, they
can still possess almost isotropic {\it local} structures. Our construction
algorithm enables one to control the statistical anisotropy of composite
microstructures which is crucial to engineering directional optical, transport
and mechanical properties of two-phase composite media.

<h3>Colossal magnetoresistance in Ti lightly-doped Cr2Se3 single crystals  with layered structure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Stoichiometric Cr2Se3 single crystals are particular layer-structured
antiferromagnets which possess noncolinear spin configuration, weak
ferromagnetic moments, moderate magnetoresistance (MR ~ 14.3%), and bad
metallic conductivity below the antiferromagnetic phase transition temperature.
Here, we report an interesting >16000% colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect
in Ti (1.5 atomic percent) lightly-doped Cr2Se3 single crystals. Such a CMR is
approximately 1143 times larger than that of the stoichiometric Cr2Se3 crystals
and is rarely observed in layered antiferromagnets and is attributed to the
frustrated spin configuration. Moreover, the Ti doping not only dramatically
changes the electronic conductivity of the Cr2Se3 crystal from a bad metal to a
semiconductor with a gap of ~ 15 meV, but also induces a change of the magnetic
anisotropy of the Cr2Se3 crystal from strong out-of-plane to weak in plane.
Further, magnetotransport measurements reveal that the low-field MR scales with
the square of the reduced magnetization, which is a signature of CMR materials.
The layered Ti:Cr2Se3 with CMR effect could be used as 2D heterostructure
building blocks to provide colossal negative MR in spintronic devices.

<br>
<br>
The effect of ion bombardment on MnAs single crystalline thin films is
studied. The role of elastic collisions between ions and atoms of the material
is singled-out as the main process responsible for modifying the properties of
the material. Thermal hysteresis suppression, and the loss of sharpness of the
magneto-structural phase transition are studied as a function of different
irradiation conditions. While the latter is shown to be associated with the ion
induced disorder at the scale of the transition correlation length, the former
is related to the coupling between disorder and the large-scale elastic field
associated with the phase coexistence pattern.

<h3>Magnetotransport and Berry phase Tuning in Gd-doped Bi2Se3 Topological  Insulator Single Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13847" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13847</a>
<br>
<i>Lei Chen, Shuang-Shuang Li, Weiyao Zhao, Abdulhakim Bake, David Cortie, Xiaolin Wang, Julie Karel, Han Li, Ren-Kui Zheng</i>
<br>
<br>
The Berry phase is an important concept in solids, correlated to the band
topology, axion electrodynamics and potential applications of topological
materials. Here, we investigate the magnetotransport and Berry phase of rare
earth element Gd doped Bi2Se3 (Gd_Bi2Se3) topological insulator at low
temperatures and high magnetic fields. Gd_Bi2Se3 single crystals show
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with nontrivial Berry phase while Bi2Se3
single crystals show zero Berry phase in SdH oscillations. The temperature
dependent magnetization curves can be well fitted with the Curie-Weiss law in
3-300 K region, indicating no magnetic ordering in Gd_Bi2Se3 crystals.
Moreover, Gd doping has limited influence on the quantum oscillation parameters
(e.g., frequency of oscillations, the area of the Fermi surface, effective
electron mass, Fermi wave vectors etc.), but has an impact on the Hall
mobility, carrier density, and band topology. Our results demonstrate that Gd
doping can tune the Berry phase of topological insulators effectively, which
may pave a way for the future realization of many predicted exotic transport
phenomena of topological origin.

<h3>Fast Fabrication of WS2/Bi2Se3 Heterostructures for High Performance  Photodetection</h3>

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) material heterostructures have attracted considerable
attention owing to their interesting and novel physical properties, which
expand the possibilities for future optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and
nanoelectronic applications. A portable, fast, and deterministic transfer
technique is highly needed for the fabrication of heterostructures. Herein, we
report a fast half wet poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) transfer process utilizing
the change of adhesion energy with the help of micron-sized water droplets.
Using this method, a vertical stacking of the WS2/Bi2Se3 heterostructure with a
straddling band configuration is successfully assembled on a fluorophlogopite
substrate. Thanks to the complementary band gaps and high efficiency of
interfacial charge transfer, the photodetector based on the heterostructure
exhibits a superior responsivity of 109.9 A/W for a visible incident light at
473 nm and 26.7 A/W for a 1064 nm near-infrared illumination. Such high
photoresponsivity of the heterostructure demonstrates that our transfer method
not only owns time efficiency but also ensures high quality of the
heterointerface. Our study may open new pathways to the fast and massive
fabrication of various vertical 2D heterostructures for applications in
twistronics/valleytronics and other band engineering devices.

<h3>Emulating Expert Insight: A Robust Strategy for Optimal Experimental  Design</h3>

<br>
<br>
The challenge of optimal design of experiments (DOE) pervades materials
science, physics, chemistry, and biology. Bayesian optimization has been used
to address this challenge in vast sample spaces, although it requires framing
experimental campaigns through the lens of maximizing some observable. This
framing is insufficient for epistemic research goals that seek to
comprehensively analyze a sample space, without an explicit scalar objective
(e.g., the characterization of a wafer or sample library). In this work, we
propose a flexible formulation of scientific value that recasts a dataset of
input conditions and higher-dimensional observable data into a continuous,
scalar metric. Intuitively, the scientific value function measures where
observables change significantly, emulating the perspective of experts driving
an experiment, and can be used in collaborative analysis tools or as an
objective for optimization techniques. We demonstrate this technique by
exploring simulated phase boundaries from different observables, autonomously
driving a variable temperature measurement of a ferroelectric material, and
providing feedback from a nanoparticle synthesis campaign. The method is
seamlessly compatible with existing optimization tools, can be extended to
multi-modal and multi-fidelity experiments, and can integrate existing models
of an experimental system. Because of its flexibility, it can be deployed in a
range of experimental settings for autonomous or accelerated experiments.

Spin torque oscillators (STOs) are dissipative magnetic systems that provide
a natural platform for exploring non-Hermitian phenomena. We theoretically
study a two-dimensional (2d) array of STOs and show that its dynamics can be
mapped to a 2d, non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We calculate
the energy spectrum and identify the one-dimensional (1d) edge states of our
model, corresponding to auto-oscillation of STOs on the boundary of the system
while the bulk oscillators do not activate. We show that tuning the Gilbert
damping, injected spin current, and coupling between STOs allows for exploring
the edge state properties under different parameter regimes. Furthermore, this
system admits 1d edge states with non-uniform probability density, and we
explore their properties in systems of different sizes. Additional symmetry
analysis indicates that these states are not topologically protected but are
nevertheless confined to the edge of the system, as the bulk is protected by
PT-symmetry. These results indicate that 2d arrays of STOs may be useful to
explore novel edge state behavior in dissipative systems.

<h3>Highly Tunable Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy and Anisotropic  Magnetoresistance in Ru-doped La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 Epitaxial Films</h3>

<br>
<br>
As a prototypical half-metallic ferromagnet, La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) has been
extensively studied due to its versatile physical properties and great
potential in spintronic applications. However, the weak perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA) limits the controllability and detection of magnetism in LSMO,
thus hindering the realization of oxide-based spintronic devices with low
energy consumption and high integration level. Motivated by this challenge, we
develop an experimental approach to enhance the PMA of LSMO epitaxial films. By
cooperatively introducing 4d Ru doping and a moderate compressive strain, the
maximum uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in Ru-doped LSMO can reach 3.0 to 1E5 J/m3
at 10 K. Furthermore, we find a significant anisotropic magnetoresistance
effect in these Ru-doped LSMO films, which is dominated by the strong PMA. Our
findings offer an effective pathway to harness and detect the orientations of
magnetic moments in LSMO films, thus promoting the feasibility of oxide-based
spintronic devices, such as spin valves and magnetic tunnel junctions.

<h3>A stable, critical phase induced by Berry phase and dissipation in a  spin-chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated from experiments on spin-chains embedded in a metallic bath, as
well as closed quantum systems described by long-range interacting
Hamiltonians, we study a critical SU(N) spin-chain perturbed by dissipation, or
equivalently, after space-time rotation, long-range spatial interactions. The
interplay of dissipation and the Wess-Zumino (Berry phase) term results in a
rich phase diagram with multiple renormalization group fixed points. For a
range of the exponent that characterizes the dissipative bath, we find a
second-order phase transition between the fixed point which describes an
isolated spin-chain, and a dissipation-induced-ordered phase. More
interestingly, for a different range of the exponent, we find a stable,
gapless, non-relativistic phase of matter whose existence necessarily requires
coupling to the dissipative bath. Upon tuning the exponent, we find that the
fixed-point corresponding to this gapless, stable phase 'annihilates' the fixed
point that describes the transition out of this phase to the ordered phase. We
also study a relativistic version of our model, and identify a new critical
point. We discuss implications of our work for Kondo lattice systems, and
engineered long-range interacting quantum systems.

<br>

We study the time-dependent response of a Heisenberg spin ladder subjected to
a time-dependent square form variation of its rung spin exchange coupling. To
do so, we employ a field theoretic representation of the Heisenberg spin ladder
consisting of a singlet and a triplet of Majorana fermions. Because this
underlying description is free fermionic, we are able to develop closed form
analytic expressions for dynamical quantities, both one-body measures of local
spin correlations as well as two-time correlation functions. These expressions
involve both the gaps to triplet and singlet excitations. We analyze these
expressions obtaining both the time scales for their transients and long-time
athermal steady state behaviors. We show that variations in the rung coupling
are directly tied to changes in the local antiferromagnetic correlations. We
further discuss the application of these results to pump-probe experiments on
material realizations of low-dimensional magnetic systems.

We introduce the stochastic process of incremental multifractional Brownian
motion (IMFBM), which locally behaves like fractional Brownian motion with a
given local Hurst exponent and diffusivity. When these parameters change as
function of time the process responds to the evolution gradually: only new
increments are governed by the new parameters, while still retaining a
power-law dependence on the past of the process. We obtain the mean squared
displacement and correlations of IMFBM which are given by elementary formulas.
We also provide a comparison with simulations and introduce estimation methods
for IMFBM. This mathematically simple process is useful in the description of
anomalous diffusion dynamics in changing environments, e.g., in viscoelastic
systems, or when an actively moving particle changes its degree of persistence
or its mobility.

Multi-band effects in hybrid structures provide a rich playground for
unconventional superconductivity. We combine two complementary approaches based
on density-functional theory (DFT) and effective low-energy model theory in
order to investigate the proximity effect in a Rashba surface state in contact
to an $s$-wave superconductor. We discuss these synergistic approaches and
combine the effective model and DFT analysis at the example of a Au/Al
heterostructure. This allows us to predict finite-energy superconducting
pairing due to the interplay of the Rashba surface state of Au, and
hybridization with the electronic structure of superconducting Al. We
investigate the nature of the induced superconducting pairing and quantify its
mixed singlet-triplet character. Our findings demonstrate general recipes to
explore real material systems that exhibit inter-orbital pairing away from the
Fermi energy.

<h3>Normal state quantum geometry and superconducting domes in (111) oxide  interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13993" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13993</a>
<br>
<i>Florian Simon, Mark O. Goerbig, Marc Gabay</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the influence of the normal state quantum
geometry on the superconducting phase in (111) oriented oxide interfaces and
discuss some of its implications in the case of the
$\text{LaAlO}_3/\text{SrTiO}_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. Based on a
tight-binding representation of this interface, we introduce a low-energy model
for which we compute the quantum geometry of the lowest band. The quantum
metric exhibits a high peak around the $\Gamma$ point, owing to the closeness
of the band to a degeneracy point, while the Berry curvature is negligible. We
then compute the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid
weight. The conventional part increases linearly with the chemical potential
$\mu$, a generic behaviour for Schr\"odinger-like bands. The geometric part
shows a dome upon varying $\mu$, and we argue that this is a generic behaviour
when the quantum metric is peaked at the zero-filling point (where the filling
starts). Both contributions can be of the same order when we include disorder
effects, yielding a dome-shaped superfluid weight as a function of the chemical
potential. Experimentally, a dome-shaped superconducting temperature is
observed when the gate voltage $V_g$ is changed. We suggest that this effect
stems from the variation of the chemical potential with $V_g$ and that it
mirrors the evolution of the conventional part of the superfluid weight up to
optimal doping. Furthermore, we propose that a second superconducting dome
could be found at larger values of $V_g$ , as a result of the dominant
contribution of the geometric superfluid weight, which would also matter in
saturating the overdoped regime of the observed dome. Such features would
underscore the impact of the normal state quantum geometry on the
superconducting state.

<h3>Adiabatic Cooper Pair Splitter</h3>

<br>
<i>Fredrik Brange, Riya Baruah, Christian Flindt</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have observed Cooper pair splitting in quantum dots
coupled to superconductors, and efficient schemes for controlling and timing
the splitting process are now called for. Here, we propose and analyze an
adiabatic Cooper pair splitter that can produce a regular flow of
spin-entangled electrons in response to a time-dependent and periodic gate
voltage. The splitting process is controlled by moving back and forth along an
avoided crossing between the empty state and the singlet state of two quantum
dots that are coupled to a superconductor, followed by the emission of the
split Cooper pairs into two normal-state drains. The scheme does not rely on
fine-tuned resonance conditions and is therefore robust against experimental
imperfections in the driving signal. We identify a range of driving
frequencies, where the output currents are quantized and proportional to the
driving frequency combined with suppressed low-frequency noise. We also discuss
the main sources of cycle-missing events and evaluate the statistics of
electrons emitted within a period of the drive as well as the distribution of
waiting times between them. Realistic parameter estimates indicate that the
Cooper pair splitter can be operated in the gigahertz regime.

<h3>Collective Excitations of Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates:  Breathing Mode and Appearance of Anisotropy under Self-Gravity</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the collective mode of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation. The
self-gravitating BEC recently receives significant attention in cosmology and
astrophysics as a candidate for dark matter. We investigate the breathing and
anisotropic collective modes by numerically solving the GPP equation and using
the variational method. The breathing mode shows that the period decreases with
the total mass due to the density dependence of the self-gravitating BEC, which
is quantitatively consistent with our analytical results. We also obtain an
anisotropic collective mode, in which the quadrupole mode is coupled with the
breathing mode. The period of the quadrupole mode has the same total mass
dependence as that of the breathing mode. The characteristics of these periods
are different from those of ordinary BECs trapped by an external potential.
However, despite the difference in density dependence, their ratio is equal to
that of the BEC trapped by an isotropic harmonic potential. Furthermore, a
variational method extended to a spheroidal configuration shows that we extract
only the quadrupole mode from the anisotropic collective mode.

In this big data era, the use of large dataset in conjunction with machine
learning (ML) has been increasingly popular in both industry and academia. In
recent times, the field of materials science is also undergoing a big data
revolution, with large database and repositories appearing everywhere.
Traditionally, materials science is a trial-and-error field, in both the
computational and experimental departments. With the advent of machine
learning-based techniques, there has been a paradigm shift: materials can now
be screened quickly using ML models and even generated based on materials with
similar properties; ML has also quietly infiltrated many sub-disciplinary under
materials science. However, ML remains relatively new to the field and is
expanding its wing quickly. There are a plethora of readily-available big data
architectures and abundance of ML models and software; The call to integrate
all these elements in a comprehensive research procedure is becoming an
important direction of material science research. In this review, we attempt to
provide an introduction and reference of ML to materials scientists, covering
as much as possible the commonly used methods and applications, and discussing
the future possibilities.

<h3>Effects of a surrounding environment during the coalescence of AuPd  nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is far well accepted that the morphology of nanoparticles and nanoalloys
is of paramount importance to understand their properties. Furthemore, the
morphology depends on the growth mechanism with coalescence generally accepted
as one the most common mechanisms both in liquid and in the gas phase.
Coalescence refers when two existing seeds collide and aggregate into a larger
object. It is expected that the resulting aggregate shows a compact, often
spherical structure, although strongly out of the equilibrium, referring to its
global minimum. While the coalescence of liquid droplet is widely studied, the
first stages of the coalescence between nanoseeds has attracted less interest,
although important as multiple aggregation can take place. Here we simulate the
coalescence of Au and Pd seeds by the Molecular Dynamics method, comparing the
initial stage of the coalescence in vacuum and when there is an interacting
surrounding around them. We show that the surface chemical composition of the
resulting aggregate depend on the environment as well as the overall
morphology.

<h3>Spin-flip scattering engendered negative $Δ_T$ noise</h3>

<br>

$\Delta_T$ noise generated due to temperature gradient in the absence of
charge current has recently attracted a lot of interest. In this paper, for the
first time, we derive spin-polarized charge $\Delta_T$ noise and spin
$\Delta_T$ noise along with its shot noise-like and thermal noise-like
contributions. Introducing a spin flipper at the interface of a bilayer metal
junction with a temperature gradient, we examine the impact of spin-flip
scattering. We do a detailed analysis of charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise in
four distinct setups for two distinct temperature regimes: the first case of
one hot \& the other cold reservoir and the second case of reservoirs with
comparable temperatures, and also two distinct bias voltage regimes: the first
case of zero bias voltage and second case of finite bias voltage. In all these
regimes, we ensure that the net charge current transported is zero always. We
find negative charge $\Delta_T$ noise for reservoirs at comparable temperatures
while for the one hot \& another cold reservoir case, charge $\Delta_T$ noise
is positive. We also see that spin $\Delta_T$ noise and spin $\Delta_T$ thermal
noise-like contributions are negative for one hot and the other cold reservoir
case. Recent work on the general bound for spin $\Delta_T$ shot noise with a
spin-dependent bias suggests it is always positive. In this paper, we see spin
$\Delta_T$ shot noise-like contribution to be negative in contrast to positive
charge $\Delta_T$ shot noise contribution, although in the absence of any
spin-dependent bias. Spin-flip scattering exhibits the intriguing effect of a
change in sign in both charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, which can help probe
spin-polarized transport.

<h3>Computational prediction of high thermoelectric performance in  As$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ by engineering out-of-equilibrium defects</h3>

<br>
<i>Anderson S. Chaves, Murilo Aguiar Silva, Alex Antonelli</i>
<br>
<br>
We employed first-principles calculations to investigate the thermoelectric
transport properties of the compound As$_2$Se$_3$. Early experiments and
calculations have indicated that these properties are controlled by a kind of
native defect called antisites. Our calculations using the linearized Boltzmann
transport equation within the relaxation time approximation show good agreement
with the experiments for defect concentrations of the order of 10$^{19}$
cm$^{-3}$. Based on our total energy calculations, we estimated the equilibrium
concentration of antisite defects to be about 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$. These
results suggest that the large concentration of defects in the experiments is
due to kinetic and/or off-stoichiometry effects and in principle it could be
lowered, yielding relaxation times similar to those found in other chalcogenide
compounds. In this case, for relaxation time higher than 10 fs, we obtained
high thermoelectric figures of merit of 3 for the p-type material and 2 for the
n-type one.

<h3>Establishing Magnetic Coupling in Spin-crossover-2D Hybrid  Nanostructures via Interfacial Charge-transfer Interaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite a clear demonstration of bistability in spin-crossover (SCO)
materials, the absence of long-range magnetic order and poor electrical
conductivity limit their prospect in spintronic and nanoelectronic
applications. Intending to create hybrid devices made of spin-crossover
(SCO)-2D architecture, here, we report an easily processable Fe-based SCO
nanostructures grown on 2D reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The heterostructure
shows enhanced cooperativity due to formation of interfacial charge transfer
induced inter-molecular interaction. The spin transition temperature is
controlled by tuning the coverage area of SCO nanostructured networks over the
2D surfaces, thus manipulating hysteresis (aka memory) of the heterostructure.
The enhanced magnetic coupling of the heterostructure leads to the spontaneous
magnetization states with a large coercive field of $\sim$ 3000 Oe.
Additionally, the low conductivity of the pristine SCO nanostructures is
addressed by encapsulating them on suitable 2D rGO template, enabling detection
of magnetic bistable spin states during high-spin/low-spin conductance change.
This adds spin functionality in conductance switching for realizing hybrid 2D
spintronic devices. Ab-inito calculations, on the experimentally proposed
nanostructures, corroborate the enhanced magnetic interaction in the proposed
architecture facilitated by interfacial charge transfer and provide insights on
the microscopic mechanism.

<br>
The control of mortar rheology is of paramount importance in the design of
systems and structures in 3D printing concrete by extrusion. This is
particularly sensitive for two-component (2K) processes that use an accelerator
to switch the printed mortar very quickly from a liquid behavior to a
sufficiently solid behavior to be able to be printed. It is necessary to set up
simple and effective tests within a precise methodological framework to qualify
materials evolving so quickly in an industrial context. It is obvious that
inline solutions, that is to say, post-printing solutions, will be more
desirable than benchtop-type solutions reproducing the printing conditions as
well as possible, but imperfectly. After some main key points about measuring
the structuration of mortars, we propose an original inline test using a pocket
shear vane tester. The protocols are precisely described and the simplicity and
quality of the results are demonstrated.

<h3>Non-Hermitian Chiral Edge Modes With Complex Fermi Velocity</h3>

<br>
<i>Fei Yang, Xue-Ping Ren, Su-peng Kou</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, much attention has been paid to uncovering the influence of
dissipation on a quantum system, particularly on how the non-Hermitian (NH)
terms modify the band topology of topological materials and reshape the profile
of the wavefunctions of a system (or the NH skin effect). In this paper, a
specific NH skin effect that induced by local dissipation is studied for chiral
edge modes, in which the NH term corresponds to the local imaginary Fermi
velocity of the chiral edge modes. By solving the NH Schr\"{o}dinger equation
of the non-Hermitian chiral edge modes (nhCEs) with complex Fermi velocity, we
uncovered the remarkable complex spectra and the wavefunctions of the nhCEs. We
find that the complex spectra of these modes is a straight line in the
topological materials, and its chirality can separates the modes with positive
energy from those with negative energy, in which they are localized at
different positions. We also studied the nhCEs at the boundary of 2-dimensional
(2D) topological materials, the 2D $p$-wave superconductor and the Qi-Wu-Zhang
model, in which the general law of nhCEs was verified. We expect that our
findings will pave the way for researching the transport properties of the
chiral edge modes in the non-equilibrium context.

<h3>Reliable phase quantification in focused probe electron ptychography of  thin materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Christoph Hofer, Timothy J. Pennycook</i>
<br>
<br>
Electron ptychography provides highly sensitive, dose efficient phase images
which can be corrected for aberrations after the data has been acquired. This
is crucial when very precise quantification is required, such as with
sensitivity to charge transfer due to bonding. Drift can now be essentially
eliminated as a major impediment to focused probe ptychography, which benefits
from the availability of easily interpretable simultaneous Z-contrast imaging.
However challenges have remained when quantifying the ptychographic phases of
atomic sites. The phase response of a single atom has a negative halo which can
cause atoms to reduce in phase when brought closer together. When unaccounted
for, as in integrating methods of quantification, this effect can completely
obscure the effects of charge transfer. Here we provide a new method of
quantification that overcomes this challenge, at least for 2D materials, and is
robust to experimental parameters such as noise, sample tilt.

<h3>Understanding the dynamics of randomly positioned dipolar spin ensembles</h3>

<br>
<i>Timo Gräßer, Kristine Rezai, Alexander O. Sushkov, Götz S. Uhrig</i>
<br>
<br>
Dipolar spin ensembles with random spin positions attract much attention
currently because they help to understand decoherence as it occurs in solid
state quantum bits in contact with spin baths. Also, these ensembles are
systems which may show many-body localization, at least in the sense of very
slow spin dynamics. We present measurements of the autocorrelations of spins on
diamond surfaces in a doubly-rotating frame which eliminates local disorder.
Strikingly, the time scales in the longitudinal and the transversal channel
differ by more than one order of magnitude which is a factor much greater than
one would have expected from simulations of spins on lattices. A previously
developed dynamic mean-field theory for spins (spinDMFT) fails to explain this
phenomenon. Thus, we improve it by extending it to clusters (CspinDMFT). This
theory does capture the striking mismatch up to two orders of magnitude for
random ensembles. Without positional disorder, however, the mismatch is only
moderate with a factor below 4. The pivotal role of positional disorder
suggests that the strong mismatch is linked to precursors of many-body
localization.

<h3>Randomized higher-order tensor renormalization group</h3>

<br>
<i>Katsumasa Nakayama</i>
<br>
<br>
The higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) is a fundamental method
to calculate the physical quantities by using a tensor network representation.
This method is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) to take the
contraction of all indices in the network with an approximation. For the SVD,
randomized singular value decomposition (R-SVD) is a powerful method to reduce
computational costs of SVD. However, HOTRG with the randomized method is not
established. We propose a randomized HOTRG method in a dimension $d$ with the
computational cost $O(D^{3d})$ depending on the truncated bond dimension $D$.
We also introduce the minimally-decomposed TRG (MDTRG) as the R-HOTRG on the
tensor of order $d+1$ with $O(D^{2d + 1})$ and a triad representation of the
MDTRG (Triad-MDTRG) with $O(D^{d+3})$. The results from these formulations are
consistent with the HOTRG result with the same truncated bond dimension $D$.

Topological insulators are characterized by insulating bulk and conducting
surface, the latter is a necessity consequence of the nontrivial topology of
the wavefunctions forming the valence band. This chapter gives a historical
overview of the discovery of topological insulators and a concise description
of the $Z_2$ topology which defines them. The concept of topological insulators
have been extended to various other topologies, giving rise to the recognition
of further topological states of matter such as topological crystalline
insulators and higher-order topological insulators. Representative materials of
topological insulators, their synthesis techniques, and the ways for the
experimental confirmation of the topological nature are introduced. Among the
interesting phenomena derived from topological insulators, topological
superconductivity, Majorana zero modes, and quantum anomalous Hall effect are
briefly discussed.

We investigate the effect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) of hydrogen atoms
on the elasticity of ice VII at high pressure and ambient temperature
conditions using ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)
calculations. We find that the NQEs of hydrogen contributes to the transition
of ice VII from a static disordered structure to a dynamically disordered
structure at pressures exceeding 40 GPa. This transition is marked by a
discontinuous increase of the elastic constants. Comparison of ab initio
molecular dynamics and PIMD calculations reveal that NQEs increase the elastic
constants of ice by about 20% at 70 GPa and 300 K.

<h3>Why soft contacts are stickier when breaking than when making them</h3>

<br>
<br>
Insects, pick-and-place manufacturing, engineered adhesives, and soft robots
employ soft materials to stick to surfaces even in the presence of roughness.
Experiments show that the force required for making contact is lower than for
releasing it, a phenomenon known as the adhesion hysteresis. The common
explanation for this hysteresis is either contact aging or viscoelasticity.
Here, we show that adhesion hysteresis emerges even for perfectly elastic
contacts and in the absence of contact aging and viscoelasticity because of
surface roughness. We present a crack-perturbation model and experimental
observations that reveal discrete jumps of the contact perimeter. These
stick-slip instabilities are triggered by local differences in fracture energy
between roughness peaks and valleys. Pinning of the contact perimeter retards
both its advancement when coming into contact and its retraction when pulling
away. Our model quantitatively reproduces the hysteresis observed in
experiments and allows us to derive analytical predictions for its magnitude,
accounting for realistic rough geometries across orders of magnitude in length
scale. Our results explain why adhesion hysteresis is ubiquitous and reveal why
soft pads in nature and engineering are efficient in adhering even to surfaces
with significant roughness.

I establish the criteria and obtained analytical results for the pseudogap at
the Van Hove (antinodal) point on the Fermi surface in two dimensions. The
original criterion $\xi >> \xi_{th\_db}=v_F/\pi T$ is not applicable in this
case since Fermi velocity $v_F=0$. It turns out that the characteristic length
for the pseudogap crossover at the Van Hove point $\xi_{th\_vh} \propto
1/T^{1/2}$, which is significantly shorter than the one at the regular Fermi
surface points $\xi_{th\_db} \propto 1/T$. In particular, $\xi_{th\_vh}$ is
between one and two lattice spacing in the intermediate interaction regime of
the Hubbard model. I have also identified the regime where there is still a
single maximum in the spectral function, but single particle properties are
abnormal. Specifically, the imaginary part of the self-energy has a minimum
instead of maximum at the Fermi level and the slope of the real part of the
self-energy is positive instead of negative. The important advantages of an
analytical approach is that it provides results in both the Matsubara frequency
representation and in real frequencies representation. I compare Matsubara
frequency results with the exact numerical results of the Monte Carlo methods
in the Hubbard model and then show what they correspond to in the real
frequency self-energy and spectral function.

<br>
<br>
Berry phase interference arguments that underlie the theory of deconfined
quantum criticality (DQC) for spin-1/2 antiferromagnets have also been invoked
to allow for continuous transitions in spin-1 magnets including a N\'eel to
(columnar) valence bond solid (cVBS) transition. We provide a microscopic model
realization of this transition on the square lattice consisting of Heisenberg
exchange (J_H) and biquadratic exchange (J_B) that favor a N\'eel phase, and a
designed Q-term (Q_B) interaction which favors a cVBS through large-scale
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For J_H=0, this model is equivalent to
the SU(3) JQ model with a N\'eel-cVBS transition that has been argued to be DQC
through QMC. Upon turning on J_H which brings down the symmetry to SU(2), we
find multiple signatures -- a single critical point, high quality collapse of
correlation ratios and order parameters, "U(1)-symmetric" cVBS histograms and
lack of double-peak in order parameter histograms for largest sizes studied
near the critical point -- that are highly suggestive of a continuous
transition scenario. However, Binder analysis finds negative dips that grow
sub-extensively that we interpret as these transitions rather being
pseudocritical. This along with recent results on spin-1/2 models suggests that
deconfined pseudocriticality is the more generic scenario.

Within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems, we
demonstrate that an off-resonant high-frequency electromagnetic field can
induce the Lifshitz phase transition in periodical structures described by the
one-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model with the nearest and next-nearest
neighbor hopping. The transition changes the topology of electron energy
spectrum at the Fermi level, transforming it from the two Fermi-points to the
four Fermi-points, what facilitates the emergence of the superconducting
fluctuations in the structure. Possible manifestations of the effect and
conditions of its experimental observability are discussed.

<i>Ruben Zakine, Jerome Garnier-Brun, Antoine-Cyrus Becharat, Michael Benzaquen</i>
<br>
<br>
How robust are socioeconomic agent-based models with respect to the details
of the agents' decision rule? We tackle this question by considering an
occupation model in the spirit of the Sakoda-Schelling model, historically
introduced to shed light on segregation dynamics among human groups. For a
large class of utility functions and decision rules, we pinpoint the
nonequilibrium nature of the agent dynamics, while recovering the
equilibrium-like phase separation phenomenology. Within the mean field
approximation we show how the model can be mapped, to some extent, onto an
active matter field description (Active Model B). Finally, we consider
non-reciprocal interactions between two populations, and show how they can lead
to non-steady macroscopic behavior. We believe our approach provides a unifying
framework to further study geography-dependent agent-based models, notably
paving the way for joint consideration of population and price dynamics within
a field theoretic approach.

Boundaries between structural twins of bilayer graphene (so-called AB/BA
domain walls) are often discussed in terms of the formation of topologically
protected valley-polarised chiral states. Here, we show that, depending on the
width of the AB/BA boundary, the latter can also support non-chiral
one-dimensional (1D) states that are confined to the domain wall at low
energies and take the form of quasi-bound states at higher energies, where the
1D bands cross into the two-dimensional spectral continuum. We present the
results of modeling of electronic properties of AB/BA domain walls with and
without magnetic field as a function of their width and interlayer bias.

Recently, we introduced the active Dyson Brownian motion model (DBM), in
which $N$ run-and-tumble particles interact via a logarithmic repulsive
potential in the presence of a harmonic well. We found that in a broad range of
parameters the density of particles converges at large $N$ to the Wigner
semi-circle law, as in the passive case. In this paper, we provide an
analytical support for this numerical observation, by studying the fluctuations
of the positions of the particles in the nonequilibrium stationary state of the
active DBM, in the regime of weak noise and large persistence time. In this
limit, we obtain an analytical expression for the covariance between the
particle positions for any $N$ from the exact inversion of the Hessian matrix
of the system. We show that, when the number of particles is large $N \gg 1$,
the covariance matrix takes scaling forms that we compute explicitly both in
the bulk and at the edge of the support of the semi-circle. In the bulk, the
covariance scales as $N^{-1}$, while at the edge, it scales as $N^{-2/3}$.
Remarkably, we find that these results can be transposed directly to an
equilibrium model, the overdamped Calogero-Moser model in the low temperature
limit, providing an analytical confirmation of the numerical results by
Agarwal, Kulkarni and Dhar. For this model, our method also allows us to obtain
the equilibrium two-time correlations and their dynamical scaling forms both in
the bulk and at the edge. Our predictions at the edge are reminiscent of a
recent result in the mathematics literature by Gorin and Kleptsyn on the
(passive) DBM. That result can be recovered by the present methods, and also,
as we show, using the stochastic Airy operator. Finally, our analytical
predictions are confirmed by precise numerical simulations, in a wide range of
parameters.

We extend and benchmark the recently-developed Effective-Hamiltonian (EFFH)
method [PRX Quantum $\bf{4}$, 020307 (2023)] as an approximation to the
equilibrium state ("mean-force Gibbs state") of a quantum system at strong
coupling to a thermal bath. The EFFH method is an approximate framework.
Through a combination of the reaction-coordinate mapping, a polaron
transformation and a controlled truncation, it imprints the system-bath
coupling parameters into the system's Hamiltonian. First, we develop a
$\textit{variational}$ EFFH technique. In this method, system's parameters are
renormalized by both the system-bath coupling parameters (as in the original
EFFH approach) and the bath's temperature. Second, adopting the generalized
spin-boson model, we benchmark the equilibrium state from the EFFH treatment
against numerically-exact simulations and demonstrate a good agreement for both
polarization and coherences using the Brownian spectral function. Third, we
contrast the (normal and variational) EFFH approach with the familiar (normal
and variational) polaron treatment. We show that the two methods predict a
similar structure for the equilibrium state, albeit the EFFH approach offers
the advantage of simpler calculations and closed-form analytical results.
Altogether, we argue that for temperatures comparable to the system's
frequencies, the EFFH methodology provides a good approximation for the
mean-force Gibbs state in the full range of system-bath coupling, from
ultraweak to ultrastrong.

<h3>Non-Hermitian tearing by dissipation</h3>

In the paper, we study the non-Hermitian system under dissipation in which
the energy band shows an imaginary line gap and energy eigenstates are bound to
a specific region. To describe these phenomena, we propose the concept of
"non-Hermitian tearing", in which the degree of tearing we defined reveals a
continuous phase transition at the exceptional point. The non-Hermitian tearing
manifests in two forms -- bulk state separation and boundary state decoupling.
For a deeper understanding of non-Hermitian tearing, we give the effective 2*2
Hamiltonian in the k-space by reducing the N*N Hamiltonian in the real space.
In addition, we also explore the non-Hermitian tearing in the one-dimensional
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model. Our results provide a
theoretical approach for studying non-Hermitian tearing in more complex
systems.
