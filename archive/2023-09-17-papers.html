<h3>Odd thermoelasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08262</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Ostoja-Starzewski, Piotr Surówka</i>
<br>
<br>
We generalize the odd elasticity of planar materials to thermoelasticity,
admitting spatially inhomogeneous properties. First, we show that for active
systems breaking Onsager relations thermal evolution is given by an odd
generalization of the Maxwell-Cattaneo relation. Next three different heat
conduction models of odd solids are considered leading, respectively, to a
classical coupled thermoelasticity with Fourier law, thermoelasticity with
relaxation times of the Maxwell-Cattaneo type, and thermoelasticity with two
relaxation times. Governing equations are established in terms of either
displacement-temperature pair, stress-heat flux pair, or stress-temperature
pair. Next, we establish a form of the stiffness tensor, ensuring its inversion
to a compatibility tensor, and write equations of elasticity in the presence of
eigenstrains, such as thermal strains. Finally, we find that the stress field
remains unchanged for a specific additive change of the compliance tensor
field. This so-called stress invariance gives an equivalence class of a wide
range of odd materials with different values of material properties.
Effectively, within each class, the elastic compliances may be modified by a
field linear in the plane without affecting the stress field. Finally, we study
hydrodynamic modes in an odd thermoelastic solid with Fourier heat conduction
and argue that contrary to even elastic solids, the temperature can affect both
dilatational and shear waves. We present odd corrections to sound attenuation
and diffusion coefficients.

<h3>A Dedicated Modelling Scheme for Nonclassical Optical Response from the  Nanosphere-on-Mirror Structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08311</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaotian Yan, Christos Tserkezis, N. Asger Mortensen, Guy A. E. Vandenbosch, Xuezhi Zheng</i>
<br>
<br>
Within the framework of the T-matrix method, we present a modeling tool that
predicts the optical response from the Nanosphere-on-Mirror (NSoM) construct.
The nonclassical effects in metals are accounted for by the nonlocal
hydrodynamic Drude model (NLHDM) or the surface response model (SRM). Two
essential elements in the T-matrix method, i.e., the T-matrix of the sphere and
the R matrix accounting for the effects of the mirror, have been fully upgraded
to include longitudinal waves for the NLHDM and the augmented interface
conditions for the SRM. The proposed tool is quantitatively validated both in
the near and the far field by an in-house developed BEM solver for the NLHDM
where the gap between the sphere and the mirror is as small as 1 nm. Two
physical checks are performed, where the results from the classical local
response model are compared with the ones from the NLHDM and the SRM. The
observed shifts in resonances and reduced field enhancements in the gap region
agree well with previous physical findings. The proposed tool may not only
serve as a reference tool for other numerical methods, but also provides an
ideal platform for investigating nonclassical optical processes in the NSoM,
hence paving a semi-analytical way to understand the extreme optics at very
small scales.

<h3>Deciphering the Enigma of Cu-Doped Lead Apatite (LK-99): Structural  Insights, Electronic Properties, and Implications for Ambient-Pressure  Superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07928</a>
<br>
<i>Jun Li, Qi An</i>
<br>
<br>
The most recent discovery, the Cu-doped lead apatite LK-99, is a proposed
room-temperature superconductor operating under ambient pressure. However, this
discovery has brought a slew of conflicting results from different scientific
groups. While some observed the absence of electrical resistance, others could
not confirm any signs of superconductivity in LK-99. Here, we investigate the
structural and electronic properties of LK-99 and its antecedent compounds
through quantum mechanics (QM) and QM-based molecular dynamics (QM-MD)
simulations. Our study elucidates the insulating nature of base compounds,
Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O and Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$, spotlighting their
large band gaps. Notably, Cu doping in LK-99 disrupts its symmetry, yielding a
distorted ground-state crystal structure with a triclinic P1 symmetry and
CuO$_4$ square coordination. Such alterations predispose LK-99 to exhibit
semiconducting behaviors, characterized by a flat band above the Fermi energy,
arising from Cu-3d and O-2p orbitals. In addition, the S doping sustains the
triclinic P1 symmetry but leads to a significantly reduced band gap, with a
band emerging primarily from Cu-3d and S-3p orbitals. These findings are
important in understanding LK-99's structural and electronic properties and
provide a strategic compass for the development of high-T$_C$ superconductors.

<h3>Geometrically Taming Dynamical Entanglement Growth in Purified Quantum  States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07961</a>
<br>
<i>Tim Pokart, Carl Lehmann, Jan Carl Budich</i>
<br>
<br>
Entanglement properties of purified quantum states are of key interest for
two reasons. First, in quantum information theory minimally entangled purified
states define the Entanglement of Purification as a fundamental measure for the
complexity of the corresponding physical mixed state. Second, dynamical
entanglement growth in purified states represents the main bottleneck for
calculating dynamical physical properties on classical computers in the
framework of tensor network states. Here, we demonstrate how geometric methods
including parallel transport may be harnessed to drastically reduce such
dynamical entanglement growth, and to obtain a general prescription for
maintaining (locally) optimal entanglement entropy when time-evolving a
purified state. Adapting and extending by higher order skew corrections the
notion of Uhlmann geometric phases, we thus reveal the relation between
dynamical entanglement growth and the geometry of the Hilbert-Schmidt bundle as
the mathematical foundation of purified states. With benchmarks on a
non-integrable spin chain model, we compare the computational performance of
matrix product state algorithms based on our present geometric disentangling
method to previous approaches for taming entanglement growth in purified
states. Our findings provide numerical evidence that geometric disentanglers
are at least competitive and even outperform existing techniques in an extended
parameter regime relevant to the practical calculation of dynamical response
functions. To exclude the effect of avoidable algorithmic imperfections, we
provide a numerically exact analysis for systems of moderate size.

<h3>Photo-induced reversible modification of the Curie-Weiss temperature in  paramagnetic gadolinium compounds</h3>

Gadolinium oxyhydride GdHO is a photochromic material that darkens under
illumination and bleaches back by thermal relaxation. As an inorganic
photochromic material that can be easily deposited by magnetron sputtering,
GdHO has very interesting potential applications as a functional material,
specially for smart glazing applications. However, the underlying reasons
behind the photochromic mechanism-which can be instrumental for the correct
optimisation of GdOH for different applications-are not completely understood.
In this paper, we rely on the well-stablished magnetic properties of Gd$^{3+}$
to shed light on this matter. GdOH thin films present paramagnetic behaviour
similar to other Gd$^{3+}$ compounds such as Gd$_2$O$_3$. Illumination of the
films result in a reversible increase of the Curie-Weiss temperature pointing
to RKKY interactions, which is consistent with the resistivity decrease
observed in the photo-darkened films.

<h3>AFM insulating state and normal state of cuprates from first principle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07997" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07997</a>
<br>
<i>Zheting Jin, Sohrab Ismail-Beigi</i>
<br>
<br>
Materials-realistic microscopic theoretical descriptions of copper-based
superconductors are challenging due to their complex crystal structures
combined with strong electron interactions. Here, we demonstrate how ab initio
calculations can accurately describe key structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties of the normal state of the prototypical cuprate
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212). We emphasize the importance of
accounting for energy-lowering structural distortions, which then allows us to:
(a) accurately describe the insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of
the undoped parent compound (in contrast to the metallic state predicted by
previous {\it ab initio} studies); (b) identify numerous low-energy competing
spin and charge stripe orders in the hole-overdoped material that are nearly
degenerate in energy with the G-AFM ordered state, indicating strong spin
fluctuations; (c) predict the lowest-energy hole-doped crystal structure which
exhibits long-range structural distortions and oxygen dopant positions matching
high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements;
and (d) describe electronic bands near the Fermi energy with flat antinodal
dispersions and Fermi surfaces that in agreement with angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and provide a clear explanation
for the structural origin of the so-called "shadow bands".

<h3>Curved vortex surfaces in four-dimensional superfluids: I.  Unequal-frequency double rotations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08015</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The study of superfluid quantum vortices has long been an important area of
research, with previous work naturally focusing on two-dimensional and
three-dimensional systems, where rotation stabilises point vortices and line
vortices respectively. Interestingly, this physics generalises for a
hypothetical four-dimensional (4D) superfluid to include vortex planes, which
can have a much richer phenomenology. In this paper, we study the possibility
of skewed and curved vortex planes, which have no direct analogue in lower
dimensions. By analytically and numerically studying the 4D Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, we show that such vortex surfaces can be stabilised and favoured by
double rotation with unequal rotation frequencies. Our work raises open
questions for further research into the physics of these vortex surfaces and
suggests interesting future extensions to tilted vortex surfaces under
equal-frequency double rotation and to more realistic 4D models.

<h3>Curved vortex surfaces in four-dimensional superfluids: II.  Equal-frequency double rotations</h3>

<br>
<br>
As is well-known, two-dimensional and three-dimensional superfluids under
rotation can support topological excitations such as quantized point vortices
and line vortices respectively. Recently, we have studied how, in a
hypothetical four-dimensional (4D) superfluid, such excitations can be
generalised to vortex planes and surfaces. In this paper, we continue our
analysis of skewed and curved vortex surfaces based on the 4D Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, and show that certain types of such states can be stabilised by
equal-frequency double rotations for suitable parameters. This work extends the
rich phenomenology of vortex surfaces in 4D, and raises interesting questions
about vortex reconnections and the competition between various vortex
structures which have no direct analogue in lower dimensions.

<h3>Properties of stable ensembles of Euclidean random matrices</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the spectrum of a system of coupled disordered harmonic oscillators
in the thermodynamic limit. This Euclidean random matrix ensemble has been
suggested as model for the low-temperature vibrational properties of glass.
Exact numerical diagonalization is performed in three and two spatial
dimensions. It reveals a low-frequency regime of sound waves that are damped by
Rayleigh scattering. At large frequencies localized modes exist. In between,
the central peak in the vibrational density of states is well described by
Wigner's semicircle law expected for random matrix systems. We compare our
results with predictions from two recent self-consistent field theories.

<br>
<br>
Point defects in two-dimensional materials are of key interest for quantum
information science. However, the space of possible defects is immense, making
the identification of high-performance quantum defects extremely challenging.
Here, we perform high-throughput (HT) first-principles computational screening
to search for promising quantum defects within WS$_2$, which present localized
levels in the band gap that can lead to bright optical transitions in the
visible or telecom regime. Our computed database spans more than 700 charged
defects formed through substitution on the tungsten or sulfur site. We found
that sulfur substitutions enable the most promising quantum defects. We
computationally identify the neutral cobalt substitution to sulfur (Co$_{\rm
S}^{0}$) as very promising and fabricate it with scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM). The Co$_{\rm S}^{0}$ electronic structure measured by STM agrees with
first principles and showcases an attractive new quantum defect. Our work shows
how HT computational screening and novel defect synthesis routes can be
combined to design new quantum defects.

<h3>Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in  $(d+1)$ dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08059</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Luke Causer, Jamie F. Mair, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
<br>
We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be
used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin
models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the
presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional
elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional
classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this
method for $d>1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general
observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$
four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the
$d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$
Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the
quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity
on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their
quantum phase transitions.

<h3>Using quantitative magneto-optical imaging to reveal why the ac  susceptibility of superconducting films is history-independent</h3>

<br>
<br>
Measurements of the temperature-dependent ac magnetic susceptibility of
superconducting films reveal reversible responses, i.e., irrespective of the
magnetic and thermal history of the sample. This experimental fact is observed
even in the presence of stochastic and certainly irreversible magnetic flux
avalanches which, in principle, should randomly affect the results. In this
work, we explain such an apparent contradiction by exploring the spatial
resolution of magneto-optical imaging. To achieve this, we successfully compare
standard frequency-independent first harmonic ac magnetic susceptibility
results for a superconducting thin film with those obtained by ac-emulating
magneto-optical imaging (acMOI). A quantitative analysis also provides
information regarding flux avalanches, reveals the presence of a
vortex-antivortex annihilation zone in the region in which a smooth flux front
interacts with pre-established avalanches, and demonstrates that the major
impact on the flux distribution within the superconductor happens during the
first ac cycle. Our results establish acMOI as a reliable approach for studying
frequency-independent ac field effects in superconducting thin films while
capturing local aspects of flux dynamics, otherwise inaccessible via global
magnetometry techniques.

<h3>Fermi surface and light quasi particles in hourglass nodal chain metal  \b{eta}-ReO2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum oscillations in magnetic torque and electrical resistivity were
measured to investigate the electronic structure of \b{eta}-ReO2, a candidate
hourglass nodal chain metal (Dirac loop chain metal). All the de Haas-van
Alphen oscillation branches measured at 30 mK in magnetic fields of up to 17.5
T were consistent with first-principles calculations predicting four Fermi
surfaces (FSs). The small-electron FS of the four FSs exhibited a very small
cyclotron mass, 0.059 times that of the free electrons, which is likely to be
related to the linear dispersion of the energy band. The consistency between
the quantum oscillation results and band calculations indicates the presence of
the hourglass nodal chain predicted for \b{eta}-ReO2 in the vicinity of the
Fermi energy.

<h3>Successive phase transitions of the spin-orbit-coupled metal Cd2Re2O7  probed by high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08074</a>
<br>
<i>Daigorou Hirai, Atsuhito Fukui, Hajime Sagayama, Takumi Hasegawa, Zenji Hiroi</i>
<br>
<br>
The 5d pyrochlore oxide superconductor Cd2Re2O7 (CRO) has attracted
significant interest as a spin-orbit-coupled metal (SOCM) that spontaneously
undergoes a phase transition to an odd-parity multipole phase by breaking the
spatial inversion symmetry due to the Fermi liquid instability caused by strong
spin-orbit coupling. Despite the significance of structural information during
the transition, previous experimental results regarding lattice deformation
have been elusive. We have conducted ultra-high resolution synchrotron
radiation x-ray diffraction experiments on a high-quality CRO single crystal.
The temperature-dependent splitting of the 0 0 16 and 0 0 14 reflections, which
are allowed and forbidden, respectively, in the high-temperature cubic phase I
(space group Fd-3m), has been clearly observed and reveals the following
significant facts: inversion symmetry breaking and tetragonal distortion occur
simultaneously at Ts1 = 201.5(1) K; the previously believed first-order
transition between phase II (I-4m2) and phase III (I4122) at Ts2 ~ 120 K
consists of two close second-order transitions at Ts2 = 115.4(1) K and Ts3 ~
100 K; there is a new orthorhombic phase XI (F222) in between. The order
parameters (OPs) of these continuous transitions are uniquely represented by a
two-dimensional irreducible representation Eu of the Oh point group, and the
OPs of phase XI are a linear combination of those of phases II and III. Each
phase is believed to correspond to a distinct odd-parity multipole order, and
the complex successive transitions observed may be the result of an electronic
phase transition that resolves the Fermi liquid instability in the SOCM.

<h3>Control of Static Friction by Designing Grooves on Friction Surface</h3>

This study numerically investigated the friction of viscoelastic objects with
grooves. A 3D viscoelastic block with grooves on a rigid substrate is slowly
pushed from the lateral side under uniform pressure on the top surface. The
local friction force at the interface between the block and the substrate obeys
Amontons' law. Numerical results obtained using the finite element method
reveal that the static friction coefficient decreases with increasing groove
width and depth. The propagation of the precursor slip is observed before bulk
sliding. Furthermore, bulk sliding occurs when the area of slow precursor slip
reaches a critical value, which decreases with increasing groove size. A
theoretical analysis based on a simplified model reveals that the static
friction coefficient is related to the critical area of the precursor, which is
determined by the instability of the precursor. A scaling law for the critical
area is theoretically predicted, and it indicates that the decrease in the
effective viscosity due to the formation of the grooves leads to a decrease in
the static friction coefficient. The validity of the theoretical prediction is
numerically confirmed.

<h3>Geometric landscape annealing as an optimization principle underlying  the coherent Ising machine</h3>

Given the fundamental importance of combinatorial optimization across many
diverse application domains, there has been widespread interest in the
development of unconventional physical computing architectures that can deliver
better solutions with lower resource costs. These architectures embed discrete
optimization problems into the annealed, analog evolution of nonlinear
dynamical systems. However, a theoretical understanding of their performance
remains elusive, unlike the cases of simulated or quantum annealing. We develop
such understanding for the coherent Ising machine (CIM), a network of optical
parametric oscillators that can be applied to any quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization problem. Here we focus on how the CIM finds low-energy
solutions of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass. As the laser gain is
annealed, the CIM interpolates between gradient descent on the soft-spin energy
landscape, to optimization on coupled binary spins. By exploiting spin-glass
theory, we develop a detailed understanding of the evolving geometry of the
high-dimensional CIM energy landscape as the laser gain increases, finding
several phase transitions, from flat, to rough, to rigid. Additionally, we
develop a cavity method that provides a precise geometric interpretation of
supersymmetry breaking in terms of the response of a rough landscape to
specific perturbations. We confirm our theory with numerical experiments, and
find detailed information about critical points of the landscape. Our extensive
analysis of phase transitions provides theoretically motivated optimal
annealing schedules that can reliably find near-ground states. This analysis
reveals geometric landscape annealing as a powerful optimization principle and
suggests many further avenues for exploring other optimization problems, as
well as other types of annealed dynamics, including chaotic, oscillatory or
quantum dynamics.

<h3>Emergence of partially disordered antiferromagnetism and isothermal  magnetization plateau due to geometrical frustration in a metallic compound,  Er2RhSi3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Partially disordered antiferro (PDA) magnetism (in which one of the three
magnetic ions in a triangular network remains magnetically disordered), has
been known commonly among geometrically frustrated insulating materials. The
one-third plateau in isothermal magnetization (M) of such materials has been of
great theoretical interest. Here, we report these properties in a
AlB2-structure derived metallic material, Er2RhSi3 in which Er sublattice has
triangular networks. The presence of a well-defined lamda anomaly in the
temperature (T) dependence of heat capacity and its magnetic-field (H)
dependence, and the loss of spin-disorder contribution in electrical
resistivity (rho) confirm antiferromagnetic order below (TN=) 5 K. On the other
hand, the separation of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled dc magnetic
susceptibility (chi) curves, decay of isothermal remnant magnetization and the
frequency dependence of real and imaginary components of ac chi suggest the
onset of spin-glass freezing concomitant with the antiferromagnetic order. In
addition, interestingly, we observe one-third plateau in M(H) below 20 kOe for
T less than TN. The change in rho as a function of H at a given temperature
well below TN is also revealing, with this compound exhibiting a plateau below
20 kOe, with complexities at higher fields. Therefore, this compound serves as
a prototype for theoretical understanding of transport behavior across
one-third plateau due to PDA magnetism in a metal without any interference from
the 4f delocalization phenomena.

Transfer techniques based on two dimensional (2D) materials and devices offer
immense potential towards their industrial integration with the existing
silicon based electronics. To achieve high quality devices, there is an urgent
requirement for the etching-free, and clean transfer that retain original
semiconducting properties of layered channel materials. In parallel, transfer
of metal electrode arrays on the 2D semiconductors also attract attention
towards large-scale integration for commercial applications. Here, we
demonstrate a facile PMMA-assisted etching-free one-step approach to transfer
both 2D channels and metal electrodes without damaging the contact region. The
direct device transfer (DDT) technique enables residue-free monolayer MoS2 as
channel material towards achieving doping-free intrinsic transistors with
enhanced performances. The crystalline quality, strain relaxation, and
interfacial coupling effects are studied using Raman and photoluminescence
spectra with spatial mapping. Post device transfer, a reduced pinning effect is
observed by the effective modulation of gate tunable drain currents in MoS2
transistors at room temperature. Furthermore, the extracted Schottky barrier
heights, temperature dependence of threshold voltage shifts, hysteresis
evolution, and mobility enhancements validates the improved transistor
performances in transferred devices. The proposed DDT method can be utilized to
directly transfer array of devices of 2D materials and heterostructures
skipping various cumbersome steps in between and hence could offer high
performance reliable electronic applications.

<h3>Quantum Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetals modulated by the  Lifshitz transition of the Fermi arc surface states</h3>

<br>
<i>Tao-Rui Qin, Zhuo-Hua Chen, Tian-Xing Liu, Fu-Yang Chen, Hou-Jian Duan, Ming-Xun Deng, Rui-Qiang Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the magnetotransport of topological Dirac semimetals (DSMs) by
taking into account the Lifshitz transition of the Fermi arc surface states. We
demonstrate that a bulk momentum-dependent gap term, which is usually neglected
in study of the bulk energy-band topology, can cause the Lifshitz transition by
developing an additional Dirac cone for the surface to prevent the Fermi arcs
from connecting the bulk Dirac points. As a result, the Weyl orbits can be
turned off by the surface Dirac cone without destroying the bulk Dirac points.
In response to the surface Lifshitz transition, the Weyl-orbit mechanism for
the 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) in topological DSMs will break down. The
resulting quantized Hall plateaus can be thickness-dependent, similar to the
Weyl-orbit mechanism, but their widths and quantized values become irregular.
Accordingly, we propose that apart from the bulk Weyl nodes and Fermi arcs, the
surface Lifshitz transition is also crucial for realizing stable Weyl orbits
and 3D QHE in real materials.

Thin films of ice and water on soil particles play crucial roles in
environmental and technological processes. Understanding the fundamental
physical mechanisms underlying their formation is essential for advancing
scientific knowledge and engineering practices. Herein, we focus on the role of
the Casimir-Lifshitz force, also referred to as dispersion force, in the
formation and behavior of thin films of ice and water on soil particles at
273.16 K, arising from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and
depending on the dielectric properties of interacting materials. We employ the
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to compute the dielectric
functions for two model materials, CaCO$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, essential
constituents in various soils. These dielectric functions are used with the
Kramers-Kronig relationship and different extrapolations to calculate the
frequency-dependent quantities required for determining forces and free
energies. Moreover, we assess the accuracy of the optical data based on the DFT
to model dispersion forces effectively, such as those between soil particles.
Our findings reveal that moisture can accumulate into almost micron-sized water
layers on the surface of calcite (soil) particles, significantly impacting the
average dielectric properties of soil particles. This research highlights the
relevance of DFT-based data for understanding thin film formation in soil
particles and offers valuable insights for environmental and engineering

In the present work, we have performed the phonon dispersion calculations of
body-centered cubic Vanadium (V) and Niobium (Nb) with the supercell approach
using different supercell size. Using DFT method, the calculated phonon spectra
of V and Nb are found to be in a good agreement with the available experimental
data. Our calculated results show a \enquote{dip}-like feature in the
longitudinal acoustic phonon mode along the $\Gamma$-H high symmetric path for
both transition metals in the case of supercell size 4$\times$4$\times$4.
However, in supercell size 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3, the
\enquote{dip}-like feature is not clearly visible. In addition to this,
thermodynamical properties are also computed, which compare well with the
experimental data. Apart from this, the phonon lifetime due to electron-phonon
interactions ($\tau_{\rm{eph}}^{\rm{ph}}$) and phonon-phonon interactions
($\tau_{\rm{ph}}^{\rm{ph}}$) are calculated. The effect of phonon-phonon
interactions (PPI) is studied by computing the average phonon lifetime for all
acoustic branches. The value of $\tau_{\rm{eph}}^{\rm{ph}}$ of V (Nb) is found
to be 23.16 (24.70)$\times 10^{-15}$ s at $100$ K, which gets decreased to 1.51
(1.85)$\times 10^{-15}$ s at 1000 K. The $\tau_{\rm{ph}}^{\rm{ph}}$ of V (Nb)
is found to be 8.59 (18.09)$\times 10^{-12}$ and 0.83 (1.76)$\times 10^{-12}$ s
at 100 and 1000 K, respectively. Nextly, the lattice thermal conductivity is
computed using linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. The present work suggests
that studying the variation of phonon dispersion with supercell size is crucial
for understanding the phonon properties of solids accurately.

<h3>Superconductivity and vortex structure on  Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ heterostructures with different  thickness of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using scanning tunnel microscopy (STM), we investigate the superconductivity
and vortex properties in topological insulator Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ thin films
grown on the iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. The
proximity-induced superconductivity weakens in the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ film when
the thickness of the film increases. Unlike the elongated shape of vortex cores
observed in the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ film with 2-quintuple-layer (QL) thickness,
the isolated vortex cores exhibit a star shape with six rays in the 1-QL film,
and the rays are along the crystalline axes of the film. This is consistent
with the sixfold rotational symmetry of the film lattice, and the
proximity-induced superconductivity is still topologically trivial in the 1-QL
film. At a high magnetic field, when the direction between the two nearest
neighbored vortices deviates from that of any crystalline axes, two cores
connect each other by a pair of adjacent rays, forming a new type of electronic
structure of vortex cores. On the 3-QL film, the vortex cores elongate along
one of the crystalline axes of the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ film, similar to the
results obtained on 2-QL films. The elongated vortex cores indicate a twofold
symmetry of the superconducting gap induced by topological superconductivity
with odd parity. This observation confirms possible topological
superconductivity in heterostructures with a thickness of more than 2 QLs. Our
results provide rich information for the vortex cores and vortex-bound states
on the heterostructures consisting of the topological insulator and the
iron-based superconductor.

<br>
<br>
Graphene field-effect transistors exhibit negligible transconductance under
two scenarios: for any gate-to-source voltage when the drain-to-source voltage
is set to zero, and for an arbitrary drain-to-source voltage provided that the
gate-to-source voltage equals the Dirac voltage. Hence, extracting the channel
and the parasitic series resistances from S-parameters under these conditions
enables analyzing their dependence on the gate and drain biases. This is
fundamental to assess the portion of the output resistance that is controlled
by the gate. Besides, the drain bias dependence of the drain and source
resistances is also evidenced. Within the proposal, resistive components
accounting for the lossy nature of the gate capacitance are incorporated into
the model, which exhibits a broadband correlation with experimental data. This
avoids the series resistances to be considered as frequency dependent in the
model.

The mechanism through which superconductivity is destroyed upon controlled
disordering often holds the key to understanding the mechanism of emergence of
superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an $in$-$situ$ mechanism to control the
fraction of disorder in a 2D superconductor. By controlling an electric field
V$_G$, we created an assembly of segregated superconducting nano-islands and
varied the inter-island distance to accomplish a quantum phase transition from
a superconducting phase to a strange quantum anomalous metallic (QAM) phase at
LaVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. In the QAM phase, the resistivity dropped below
a critical temperature (T$_{CM}$) as if the system was approaching
superconductivity, and then saturated, indicating the destruction of global
phase coherence and the emergence of a phase where metal-like transport of
Bosons (a Bose metal) becomes a possibility. The unprecedented control over the
island size is obtained through the control of nanometer scale ferroelectric
domains formed in the SrTiO$_3$ side of the interface due to a low-temperature
structural phase transition.

We propose an extended compass model that hosts subsystem symmetries and has
potential experimental relevance with 3d transition metal compounds. The
subsystem symmetries strongly constrain the mobility of spin excitations and
lead to profound consequences. At the quantum critical point we find the
presence of "critical Bose surface" along the entire $k_x$ and $k_y$ axis.
Across which we find a nodal-line spin liquid that undergoes nematic
instability at low temperatures. In the ferro-quadrupole phase, we find that
one excitation is immobile individually analogous to "fractons".

While the possibility of topological superconductivity (TSC) in hybrid
heterostructures involving topologically nontrivial band structure and
superconductors has been proposed, the realization of TSC in a single
stoichiometric material is most desired for fundamental experimental
investigation of TSC and its device applications. Bulk measurements on YRuB$_2$
detect a single superconducting gap of $\sim$ 1 meV. This is supported by our
electronic structure calculations which also reveal the existence of
topological surface states in the system. We performed surface-sensitive
Andreev reflection spectroscopy on YRuB$_2$ and detected the bulk
superconducting gap as well as another superconducting gap of $\sim$ 0.5 meV.
From our analysis of electronic structure, we show that the smaller gap is
formed in the topological surface states in YRuB$_2$ due to the proximity of
the bulk superconducting condensate. Thus, in agreement with the past
theoretical predictions, we present YRuB$_2$ as a unique system that hosts
superconducting topological surface states.

<h3>Chern-Simons-Modified-RPA-Eliashberg Theory of the nu=1/2+1/2 Quantum  Hall Bilayer</h3>

<br>
<br>
The nu=1/2+1/2 quantum Hall bilayer has been previsously modeled using
Chern-Simons-RPA-Eliashberg (CSRPAE) theory to describe pairing between the two
layers. However, these approaches are troubled by a number of divergences and
ambiguities. By using a "modified" RPA approximation to account for mass
renormalization, we can work in a limit where the cyclotron frequency is taken
to infinity, effectively projecting to a single Landau level. This,
surprisingly, controls the important divergences and removes ambiguities found
in prior attempts at CSRPAE. Examining BCS pairing of composite fermions we
find that the angular momentum channel l=+1 dominates for all distances d
between layers and at all frequency scales. Examining BCS pairing of composite
fermion electrons in one layer with composite fermion holes in the opposite
layer, we find the l=0 pairing channel dominates for all d and all frequencies.
The strength of the pairing in these two different descriptions of the same
phase of matter is found to be almost identical. This agrees well with our
understanding that these are two different but dual descriptions of the same
phase of matter.

DNA loop extrusion is arguably one of the most important players in genome
organization. The precise mechanism by which loop extruding factors (LEFs) work
is still unresolved and much debated. One of the major open questions in this
field is how do LEFs establish and maintain unidirectional motion along DNA. In
this paper, we use High-Speed AFM data to show that condensin hinge domain
displays a structural, geometric constraint on the angle within which it can
extend with respect to the DNA-bound domains. Using computer simulations, we
then show that such a geometrical constraint results in a local symmetry
breaking and is enough to rectify the extrusion process, yielding
unidirectional loop extrusion along DNA. Our work highlights an overlooked
geometric aspect of the loop extrusion process that may have a universal impact
on SMC function across organisms.

<br>
<br>
The non-Markovian continuous-time random walk model, featuring fat-tailed
waiting times and narrow distributed displacements with a non-zero mean, is a
well studied model for anomalous diffusion. Using an analytical approach, we
recently demonstrated how a fractional space advection diffusion asymmetry
equation, usually associated with Markovian L\'evy flights, describes the
spreading of a packet of particles. Since we use Gaussian statistics for jump
lengths though fat-tailed distribution of waiting times, the appearance of
fractional space derivatives in the kinetic equation demands explanations
provided in this manuscript. As applications we analyse the spreading of
tracers in two dimensions, breakthrough curves investigated in the field of
contamination spreading in hydrology and first passage time statistics. We
present a subordination scheme valid for the case when the mean waiting time is
finite and the variance diverges, which is related to L\'evy statistics for the
number of renewals in the process.

<h3>Ferromagnetic response of thin NiI$_2$ flakes up to room temperatures</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the magnetic response of thin NiI$_2$ flakes for temperatures
above 80~K. Since no magnetic ordering is expected for bulk NiI$_2$, we observe
clear paramagnetic response for massive NiI$_2$ single crystals. In contrast,
thin NiI$_2$ flakes show well-defined ferromagnetic hysteresis loop within
$\pm2$~kOe field range. The value of the response does not scale with the
sample mass, ferromagnetic hysteresis can be seen for any flake orientation in
the external field, so it originates from the sample surface, possibly, due to
the anisotropic exchange (Kitaev interaction). The observed ferromagnetism is
weakly sensitive to temperature up to 300~K. If a flake is multiply exposed to
air, ferromagnetic hysteresis is accompanied by the periodic modulation of the
magnetization curves, which is usually a fingerprint of the multiferroic state.
While NiI$_2$ flakes can not be considered as multiferroics above 80~K, surface
degradation due to the crystallohydrate formation decreases the symmetry of
NiI$_2$ surface, which produces the surface ferroelectric polarization in
addition to the described above ferromagnetic one.

<h3>Phase Transformations and Energy Gap Variations in Uniaxial and Biaxial  Strained Monolayer VS$_2$ TMDs: A Comprehensive DFT and Beyond-DFT Study</h3>

In the rapidly evolving field of 2D materials, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as compelling candidates for electronic
applications. This study investigates the electronic structure of the H-phase
monolayer VS$_2$ belonging to TMD family and the influence of strain on its
band structure through Density Functional Theory (DFT). We employ two different
pseudopotential approximations and a suite of computational methods including
DFT+U, GAUPBE, G0W0, and self-GW to provide a nuanced understanding of its
electronic band structure. A highlight of the study is its focus on how both
uniaxial and biaxial strains, ranging from -5% to +5%, affect the electronic
properties of the H-phase monolayer VS$_2$. Our comprehensive analysis reveals
that these tensile strains significantly widen the energy gap, with uniaxial
strains having a more pronounced effect than their biaxial counterparts. In
addition, we identify an intriguing phase transition from a semiconducting to a
metallic state under compressive strains, this transition is attributed to both
symmetry breaking and bond length variation in the uniaxial case, the bond
length in biaxial. These key findings not only enrich our understanding of the
intricate electronic behavior of monolayer VS$_2$ under different strains but
also pave the way for the design of innovative electronic devices using strain
engineering.

<h3>Beware of CaBER: filament thinning rheometry doesn't give `the'  relaxation time of polymer solutions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) is commonly used to measure
`the' viscoelastic relaxation time {\tau} of polymer solutions. We show
experimentally that this method in fact only provides an apparent relaxation
time that increases significantly when increasing the plate diameter and
droplet volume. Similar results are obtained with a Dripping-onto-Substrate
(DoS) method. This dependence on the flow history before the formation of the
viscoelastic filament is in contradiction with polymer models such as Oldroyd-B
that predict a filament thinning rate 1/3{\tau} which is a material property
independent of geometrical factors. We show that this is not due to artefacts
such as solvent evaporation or polymer degradation and that it cannot always be
explained by the finite extensibility of polymer chains.

<h3>Isotropic active colloids: explicit vs. implicit descriptions of  propulsion mechanisms</h3>

<br>
<i>Jeanne Decayeux, Jacques Fries, Vincent Dahirel, Marie Jardat, Pierre Illien</i>
<br>
<br>
Modeling the couplings between active particles often neglects the possible
many-body effects that control the propulsion mechanism. Accounting for such
effects requires the explicit modeling of the molecular details at the origin
of activity. Here, we take advantage of a recent two-dimensional model of
isotropic active particles whose propulsion originates from the interactions
between solute particles in the bath. The colloid catalyzes a chemical reaction
in its vicinity, which results in a local phase separation of solute particles,
and the density fluctuations of solute particles cause the enhanced diffusion
of the colloid. In this paper, we investigate an assembly of such active
particles, using (i) an explicit model, where the microscopic dynamics of the
solute particles is accounted for; and (ii) an implicit model, whose parameters
are inferred from the explicit model at infinite dilution. In the explicit
solute model, the effective diffusion coefficient of the active colloids
strongly decreases with density, an effect which is not captured by the derived
implicit model. This suggests that classical models, which usually decouple
pair interactions from activity, fail to describe collective dynamics in active
colloidal systems driven by solute-solute interactions.

<i>Daniel Schubring</i>
<br>
<br>
The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve
solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order
corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral
are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian.
A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest
theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of
divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation.
It is further shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually
a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear
modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.

On-surface synthesis has paved the way towards the fabrication and
characterization of conjugated carbon-based molecular materials that exhibit
{\pi}-magnetism such as triangulenes. Aza-triangulene, a nitrogen-substituted
derivative, was recently shown to display rich on-surface chemistry, offering
an ideal platform to investigate structure-property relations regarding
spin-selective charge transfer and magnetic fingerprints. Herein, we study
electronic changes upon fusing single molecules into larger dimeric
derivatives. We show that the closed-shell structure of aza-triangulene on
Ag(111) leads to closed-shell dimers covalently coupled through sterically
accessible carbon atoms. Meanwhile, its open-shell structure on Au(111) leads
to coupling via atoms displaying high spin density, resulting in symmetric or
asymmetric dimer products. Interestingly, whereas all fused products on Au(111)
exhibit similar charge transfer properties, only asymmetric dimers show
magnetic fingerprints. We rationalize this in terms of molecular bonding
structure and {\pi}-conjugation: in contrast to the symmetric and highly
conjugated dimer, asymmetric dimers display more localized orbitals, which
result in a larger Coulomb repulsion and thus promote single electron
occupancies with associated spin density and {\pi}-magnetism. These results
expose a clear relationship between molecular symmetry, charge transfer, and
spin states in {\pi}-conjugated carbon-based nanostructures.

We demonstrate a macro-coherent regime in molecular exciton-polariton
systems, where nonequilibrium polariton Bose--Einstein condensation coexists
with macroscopically occupied vibrational states. Strong vibronic coupling in
molecules induces an effective optomechanical interaction between cavity
polaritons and vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules, leading to
vibrational amplification in a resonant blue-detuned configuration. This
interaction maps out properties of the condensate to vibrational states,
offering a novel approach to achieve vibrational condensation with potential
applications in cavity-controlled chemistry, nonlinear and quantum optics.

<br>

Adiabatic evolution is an emergent design principle for time modulated
metamaterials, often inspired by insights from topological quantum computing
such as Majorana fermions and braiding operations. However, the pursuit of
classical adiabatic metamaterials is rooted on the assumption that classical
and quantum adiabatic evolution are equivalent. We show that this is not the
case; and some instances of quantum adiabatic evolution, such as those
containing zero modes, cannot be reproduced in classical systems. This is
because mode coupling is fundamentally different in classical mechanics. We
derive classical conditions to ensure adiabaticity and demonstrate that only
under these, from quantum mechanics distinct conditions the Berry phase and
Wilczek-Zee matrix emerge as meaningful quantities encoding the geometry of
classical adiabatic evolution.

to seek for multifunctionalities specially in the HF domain. We present, here,
new insights for the design of different HF applications such as power

We discuss coexistence of Kondo and spin excitation signals in tunneling
spectroscopy in strongly correlated polyradical $\pi$-magnetic nanographenes on
a metal surface. The Kondo signal is rationalized by a multi-orbital Kondo
screening of the unpaired electrons. The fundamental processes are spin-flips
of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order involving charged molecular multiplets. We
introduce a~perturbative model, which provides simple rules to identify the
presence of AFM channels responsible for Kondo screening. The Kondo regime is
confirmed by numerical renormalization group calculations. This framework can
be applied to similar strongly correlated open-shell systems.

The models of the Kondo chain and Anderson chain in the integer valence state

is analogous to the Mott insulator in the Hubbard chain. For the Kondo chain,
the problem is solved for arbitrary exchange interaction constant. In the

<br>
<br>
In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, transport, thermodynamic and
spectroscopic experiments pinpoint at a competition between distinct low-energy
states with and without electronic order, as well as a competition between
localized and delocalized charge carriers. In this study, we utilize Dynamical
Mean Field Theory (DMFT) on the topological heavy Fermion (THF) model of
twisted bilayer graphene to investigate the emergence of electronic
correlations and long-range order in the absence of strain. We explain the
nature of emergent insulating and correlated metallic states, as well as
transitions between them driven by three central phenomena: (i) the formation
of local spin and valley isospin moments around 100K, (ii) the ordering of the
local isospin moments around 10K, and (iii) a cascadic redistribution of charge
between localized and delocalized electronic states upon doping. At integer
fillings, we find that low energy spectral weight is depleted in the symmetric
phase, while we find insulating states with gaps enhanced by exchange coupling
in the zero-strain ordered phases. Doping away from integer filling results in
distinct metallic states: a "bad metal" above the ordering temperature, where
coherence of the low-energy electronic excitations is suppressed by scattering
off the disordered local moments, and a "good metal" in the ordered states with
coherence of quasiparticles facilitated by isospin order. Upon doping, there is
charge transfer between the localized and delocalized orbitals of the THF model
such that they get periodically filled and emptied in between integer fillings.
This charge reshuffling manifests itself in cascades of doping-induced Lifshitz
transitions, local spectral weight redistributions and periodic variations of
the electronic compressibility ranging from nearly incompressible to negative.

Choice can be defined in thermodynamical terms and be shown to have a
thermodynamic cost: choosing between a binary alternative at temperature T
dissipates an energy E > kT ln 2.

We apply the Green-Kubo (G-K) approach to obtain the thermal conductivity
tensor of $\beta$-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane ($\beta$-HMX) as a
function of pressure and temperature from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Direct application of the G-K formula exhibits slow convergence of
the integrated thermal conductivity values even for long (120 ns) accumulated
simulation times. To partially mitigate this slow convergence, we apply a
recently implemented numerical procedure [Int. J. Heat Mass Trans. 188, 122647
(2022)] that involves physically justified filtering of the MD-calculated G-K
heat current and fitting the integrated time-dependent thermal conductivity to
a physically motivated double-exponential function. The thermal conductivity
tensor was determined for pressures 1 atm $ \leq P \leq $ 30 GPa and
temperatures 300 K $\leq T \leq$ 900 K. The thermal conductivity
${\kappa}^{\alpha \beta} (T,P)$ increases with increasing pressure, by
approximately an order of magnitude over the interval considered, and decreases
with increasing temperature. The MD predictions are compared to experimental
and other theoretically determined values for the thermal conductivity of
${\beta}$-HMX. A simple, semi-empirical fitting form is proposed that captures
the behavior of $\kappa^{\alpha \alpha} (T,P)$ over the pressure and
temperature intervals studied.

We present a report on hybrid InSb-Pb nanowires that combine high spin-orbit
coupling with a high critical field and a large superconducting gap. Material
characterization indicates the Pb layer of high crystal quality on the nanowire
side facets. Hard induced superconducting gaps and gate-tunable supercurrent
are observed in the hybrid nanowires. These results showcase the promising
potential of this material combination for a diverse range of applications in
hybrid quantum transport devices.

Spin and charge pumping induced by a precessing magnetization has been
instrumental to the development of spintronics. Nonetheless, most theoretical
studies so far treat the spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation, which
disregards the dynamical competition between exchange and spin-orbit fields. In
this work, based on Keldysh formalism and Wigner expansion, we develop an
adiabatic theory of spin and charge pumping adapted to multiorbital systems
with arbitrary spin-orbit coupling. We apply this theory to the magnetic Rashba
gas and magnetic graphene cases and discuss the pumped ac and dc current. We
show that the pumped current possesses both intrinsic and extrinsic
contributions, akin to the magnetic damping. In addition, we find that higher
harmonics can be generated under large angle precession and we propose a couple
of experimental setups where such an effect could be experimentally observed.
