<h3>Persistent motion of a Brownian particle subject to repulsive feedback  with time delay</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03182</a>
<br>
<i>Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</i>
<br>
Based on analytical and numerical calculations we study the dynamics of an
overdamped colloidal particle moving in two dimensions under time-delayed,
non-linear feedback control. Specifically, the particle is subject to a force
derived from a repulsive Gaussian potential depending on the difference between
its instantaneous position, $\mathbf{r}(t)$, and its earlier position
$\mathbf{r}(t-\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the (discrete) delay time. Considering
first the deterministic case, we provide analytical results for both, the case
of small displacements and the dynamics at long times. In particular, at
appropriate values of the feedback parameters, the particle approaches a steady
state with a constant, non-zero velocity whose direction is constant as well.
In the presence of noise, the direction of motion becomes randomized at long
times, but the (numerically obtained) velocity autocorrelation still reveals
some persistence of motion. Moreover, the mean-squared displacement (MSD)
reveals a ballistic regime at intermediate times, allowing us to extract an
estimate for the effective propulsion velocity in presence of noise. We then
analyze the data in terms of exact, known results for the MSD of active
Brownian particles. The comparison indeed indicates a strong similarity between
the dynamics of the particle under repulsive delayed feedback and active
motion. This relation carries over to the behavior of the long-time diffusion
coefficient $D_\mathrm{eff}$ which, similarly to active motion, is strongly
enhanced compared to the free case. Finally we show that, for small delays,
$D_\mathrm{eff}$ can be estimated analytically.

<h3>Glassy Dynamics in Chiral Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03196" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03196</a>
<br>
<i>Vincent E. Debets, Hartmut Löwen, Liesbeth M.C. Janssen</i>
<br>
Chiral active matter is enjoying a rapid increase of interest, spurred by the
rich variety of asymmetries that can be attained in e.g. the shape or
self-propulsion mechanism of active particles. Though this has already led to
the observance of so-called chiral crystals, active chiral glasses remain
largely unexplored. A possible reason for this could be the naive expectation
that interactions dominate the glassy dynamics and the details of the active
motion become increasingly less relevant. Here we show that quite the opposite
is true by studying the glassy dynamics of interacting chiral active Brownian
particles (cABPs). We demonstrate that when our chiral fluid is pushed to
glassy conditions, it exhibits highly nontrivial dynamics, especially compared
to a standard linear active fluid such as common ABPs. Despite the added
complexity, we are still able to present a full rationalization for all
identified dynamical regimes. Most notably, we introduce a new 'hammering'
mechanism, unique to rapidly spinning particles in high-density conditions,
that can fluidize a chiral active solid.

<h3>Excitonic Condensate in Flat Valence and Conduction Bands of Opposite  Chirality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03252" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03252</a>
<br>
<i>Gurjyot Sethi, Martin Cuma, Feng Liu</i>
<br>
Excitonic Bose-Einstein condensation (EBEC) has drawn increasing attention
recently with the emergence of 2D materials. A general criterion for EBEC, as
expected in an excitonic insulator (EI) state, is to have negative exciton
formation energies in a semiconductor. Here, using exact diagonalization of
multi-exciton Hamiltonian modelled in a diatomic Kagome lattice, we demonstrate
that the negative exciton formation energies are only a prerequisite but
insufficient condition for realizing an EI. By a comparative study between the
cases of both a conduction and valence flat bands (FBs) versus that of a
parabolic conduction band, we further show that the presence and increased FB
contribution to exciton formation provide an attractive avenue to stabilize the
EBEC, as confirmed by calculations and analyses of multi-exciton energies, wave
functions and reduced density matrices. Our results warrant a similar
many-exciton analysis for other known/new candidates of EIs, and demonstrate
the FBs of opposite parity as a unique platform for studying exciton physics,
paving the way to material realization of spinor BEC and spin-superfluidity.

<h3>Vortex gap solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with  competing nonlinearities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03341" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03341</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoxi Xu, Feiyan Zhao, Yangui Zhou, Bin Liu, Xunda Jiang, Boris A. Malomed, Yongyao Li</i>
<br>
The formation and dynamics of full vortex gap solitons (FVGSs) is
investigated in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), Zeeman splitting (ZS), and competing cubic and quintic
nonlinear terms, while the usual kinetic energy is neglected, assuming that it
is much smaller than the SOC and ZS terms. Unlike previous SOC system with the
cubic-only attractive nonlinearity, in which solely semi-vortices may be
stable, with the vorticity carried by a single component, the present system
supports stable FVGS states, with the vorticity present in both components
(such states are called here full vortex solitons, to stress the difference
from the half-vortices). They populate the bandgap in the system's linear
spectrum. In the case of the cubic self-attraction and quintic repulsion,
stable FVGSs with a positive effective mass exist near the top of the bandgap.
On the contrary, the system with cubic self-repulsion and quintic attraction
produces stable FVGSs with a negative mass near the bottom of the bandgap.
Mobility and collisions of FVGSs with different topological charges are
investigated too.

<h3>Ultrafast reversible self-assembly of living tangled matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03384</a>
<br>
<i>Vishal P. Patil, Harry Tuazon, Emily Kaufman, Tuhin Chakrabortty, David Qin, Jörn Dunkel, M. Saad Bhamla</i>
<br>
Tangled active filaments are ubiquitous in nature, from chromosomal DNA and
cilia carpets to root networks and worm blobs. How activity and elasticity
facilitate collective topological transformations in living tangled matter is
not well understood. Here, we report an experimental and theoretical study of
California blackworms (Lumbriculus variegatus), which slowly form tangles over
minutes but can untangle in milliseconds. Combining ultrasound imaging,
theoretical analysis and simulations, we develop and validate a mechanistic
model that explains how the kinematics of individual active filaments
determines their emergent collective topological dynamics. The model reveals
that resonantly alternating helical waves enable both tangle formation and
ultrafast untangling. By identifying generic dynamical principles of
topological self-transformations, our results can provide guidance for
designing new classes of topologically tunable active materials.

<h3>Radiation-resistant aluminium alloy for space missions in the extreme  environment of the solar system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03397" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03397</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick D. Willenshofer, Matheus A. Tunes, Ho T. Vo, Lukas Stemper, Oliver Renk, Graeme Greaves, Peter J. Uggowitzer, Stefan Pogatscher</i>
<br>
Future human-based exploration of our solar system requires the invention of
materials that can resist harsh environments. Age-hardenable aluminium alloys
would be attractive candidates for structural components in long-distance
spacecrafts, but their radiation resistance to solar energetic particles is
insufficient. Common hardening phases dissolve and displacement damage occurs
in the alloy matrix, which strongly degrades properties. Here we present an
alloy where hardening is achieved by T-phase, featuring a giant unit cell and
highly-negative enthalpy of formation. The phase shows record radiation
survivability and can stabilize an ultrafine-grained structure upon temperature
and radiation in the alloy, therby successfully preventing displacement damage
to occur. Such concept can be considered ideal for the next-generation space
materials and the design of radiation resistant alloy.

<h3>Anomalous finite-size scaling in higher-order processes with absorbing  states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03504</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Vezzani, Miguel A. Muñoz, Raffaella Burioni</i>
<br>
We study standard and higher-order birth-death processes on fully connected
networks, within the perspective of large-deviation theory (also referred to as
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method in some contexts). We obtain a general
expression for the leading and next-to-leading terms of the stationary
probability distribution of the fraction of "active" sites, as a function of
parameters and network size $N$. We reproduce several results from the
literature and, in particular, we derive all the moments of the stationary
distribution for the $q$-susceptible-infected-susceptible ($q-SIS$) model,
i.e., a high-order epidemic model requiring of $q$ active ("infected") sites to
activate an additional one. We uncover a very rich scenario for the
fluctuations of the fraction of active sites, with non-trivial
finite-size-scaling properties. In particular, we show that the
variance-to-mean ratio diverges at criticality for $[1 \leq q\leq 3]$, with a
maximal variability at $q=2$, confirming that complex-contagion processes can
exhibit peculiar scaling features including wild variability and that the
leading-order in a large-deviation approach does not suffice to describe them:
next-to-leading terms are essential to capture the intrinsic singularity at the
origin of systems with absorbing states.

<h3>Superconductivity in a system of interacting spinful semions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03633</a>
<br>
<i>Koji Kudo, Jonathan Schirmer</i>
<br>
Non-interacting particles obeying certain fractional statistics have been
predicted to exhibit superconductivity. We discuss the issue in an attractively
interacting system of spinful semions on a lattice by numerically investigating
the presence of off-diagonal long-range order at zero temperature. For this
purpose, we construct a Hubbard model wherein two semions with opposite spin
can virtually coincide while maintaining consistency with the fractional
braiding statistics. Clear off-diagonal long range order is seen in the strong
coupling limit, consistent with the expectation that a pair of semions obeys
Bose statistics. We find that the semion system behaves similarly to a system
of fermions with the same attractive Hubbard $U$ interaction for a wide range
of $U$, suggesting that semions also undergo a BCS to BEC crossover as a
function of $U$.

<h3>Analytical results for the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks in  the XY spin chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03637</a>
<br>
<i>Gilles Parez, Riccarda Bonsignori</i>
<br>
The study of the dynamics of entanglement measures after a quench has become
a very active area of research in the last two decades, motivated by the
development of experimental techniques. However, exact results in this context
are available in only very few cases. In this work, we present the proof of the
quasiparticle picture for the dynamics of entanglement entropies for two
disjoint blocks in the XY chain after a quantum quench. As a byproduct, we also
prove the quasiparticle conjecture for the mutual information in that model.
Our calculations generalize those presented in [M. Fagotti, P. Calabrese, Phys.
Rev. A 78, 010306 (2008)] to the case where the correlation matrix is a
block-Toeplitz matrix, and rely on the multidimensional stationary phase
approximation in the scaling limit. We also test the quasiparticle predictions
against exact numerical calculations, and find excellent agreement. In the case
of three blocks, we show that the tripartite information vanishes when at least
two blocks are adjacent.

<h3>Odd elasticity and topological waves in active surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03669</a>
<br>
<i>Michele Fossati, Colin Scheibner, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli</i>
<br>
Odd elasticity encompasses active elastic systems whose stress-strain
relationship is not compatible with a potential energy. As the requirement of
energy conservation is lifted from linear elasticity, new anti-symmetric (odd)
components appear in the elastic tensor. In this work, we study the odd
elasticity and non-Hermitian wave dynamics of active surfaces, specifically
plates of moderate thickness. We find that a free-standing moderately thick,
isotropic plate can exhibit two odd-elastic moduli, both of which are related
to shear deformations of the plate. These odd moduli can endow the vibrational
modes of the plate with a nonzero topological invariant known as the first
Chern number. Within continuum elastic theory, we show that the Chern number is
related to the presence of unidirectional shearing waves that are hosted at the
plate's boundary. We show that the existence of these chiral edge waves hinges
on a distinctive two-step mechanism: the finite thickness of the sample gaps
the shear modes and the odd elasticity endows them with chirality.

<h3>Tunable superconductivity and Möbius Fermi surfaces in an  inversion-symmetric twisted van der Waals heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03125</a>
<br>
<i>Harley D. Scammell, Mathias S. Scheurer</i>
<br>
We study theoretically a moir\'e superlattice geometry consisting of
mirror-symmetric twisted trilayer graphene surrounded by identical transition
metal dichalcogenide layers. We show that this setup allows to switch on/off
and control the spin-orbit splitting of the Fermi surfaces via application of a
perpendicular displacement field $D_0$, and explore two manifestations of this
control: first, we compute the evolution of superconducting pairing with $D_0$;
this features a complex admixture of singlet and triplet pairing and, depending
on the pairing state in the parent trilayer system, phase transitions between
competing superconducting phases. Second, we reveal that, with application of
$D_0$, the spin-orbit-induced spin textures exhibit vortices which lead to
"M\"obius fermi surfaces'' in the interior of the Brillouin zone: diabatic
electron trajectories, which are predicted to dominate quantum oscillation
experiments, require encircling the $\Gamma$ point twice, making their M\"obius
nature directly observable. We further show that the superconducting order
parameter inherits the unconventional, M\"obius spin textures. Our findings
suggest that this system provides a promising experimental avenue for studying
systematically the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the multitude of
topological and correlated phases in near-magic-angle twisted trilayer
graphene.

<h3>Lifshitz gauge duality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03127" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03127</a>
<br>
<i>Leo Radzihovsky</i>
<br>
Motivated by a variety of realizations of the compact Lifshitz model I derive
its fractonic gauge dual. The resulting U(1) vector gauge theory efficiently
and robustly encodes the restricted mobility of its dipole conserving charged
matter and the corresponding topological vortex defects. The gauge theory
provides a transparent formulation of the three phases of the Lifshitz model
and gives a field theoretic formulation of the associated two-stage Higgs
transitions.

<h3>Metal-insulator transition in a 2D system of chiral unitary class</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03131" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03131</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas F. Karcher, Ilya A. Gruzberg, Alexander D. Mirlin</i>
<br>
We perform a numerical investigation of Anderson metal-insulator transition
(MIT) in a twodimensional system of chiral symmetry class AIII by combining
finite-size scaling, transport, density of states, and multifractality studies.
The results are in agreement with the sigma-model renormalization-group theory,
where MIT is driven by proliferation of vortices. We determine the phase
diagram and find an apparent non-universality of several parameters on the
critical line of MIT, which is consistent with the analytically predicted slow
renormalization towards the ultimate fixed point of the MIT. The
localization-length exponent $\nu$ is estimated as $\nu = 1.55 \pm 0.10$.

<h3>Entanglement Entropy in Timelike Slices: a Free Fermion Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03134</a>
<br>
<i>Bowei Liu, Hao Chen, Biao Lian</i>
<br>
We define the entanglement entropy of a quantum state in a discrete set of
points in an arbitrary spacetime slice, and give the explicit formula for free
fermions. We investigate timelike (causal) slices specifically. For 1D lattice
free fermions, we calculated the time-direction entanglement entropy in a set
of times $t_n=n\tau$ ($1\le n\le K$) on the same site, and identified a
stabilizing transition at $\tau=\tau_0=2\pi/E_0$, where $E_0$ is the energy
range of single-fermion spectrum. At zero temperature, the time-like
entanglement entropy of the lattice fermion with $\tau<\tau_0$ resembles the
Cardy formula for one flavor of chiral fermion. For generic slices, the
entanglement entropy shows a clear transition between spacelike and timelike
slices. We conjecture $\tau_0$ is the upper bound of time period for
consecutive local observations to retrieve information from a quantum state,
and conjecture a similar $\tau_0$ exists in interacting models.

Germanium (Ge) is increasingly used as a substrate for high-performance
optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and electronic devices. These devices are usually
grown on thick and rigid Ge substrates manufactured by classical wafering
techniques. Nanomembranes (NMs) provide an alternative to this approach while
offering wafer-scale lateral dimensions, weight reduction, limitation of waste,
and cost effectiveness. Herein, we introduce the Porous germanium Efficient
Epitaxial LayEr Release (PEELER) process, which consists of the fabrication of
wafer-scale detachable monocrystalline Ge NMs on porous Ge (PGe) and substrate
reuse. We demonstrate monocrystalline Ge NMs with surface roughness below 1 nm
on top of nanoengineered void layer enabling layer detachment. Furthermore,
these Ge NMs exhibit compatibility with the growth of III-V materials.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization shows
Ge NMs crystallinity and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) reciprocal
space mapping endorses high-quality GaAs layers. Finally, we demonstrate the
chemical reconditioning process of the Ge substrate, allowing its reuse, to
produce multiple free-standing NMs from a single parent wafer. The PEELER
process significantly reduces the consumption of Ge during the fabrication
process which paves the way for a new generation of low-cost flexible
optoelectronics devices.

The defect-rich morphology of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) thin
films leads to a glass-like arrangement of Abrikosov vortices which causes the
resistance to disappear in vanishing current densities. This vortex glass
consists of entangled vortex lines and is identified by a characteristic
scaling of the voltage-current isotherms. Randomly distributed columnar defects
stratify the vortex lines and lead to a Bose glass. Here, we report on the
observation of an ordered Bose glass in a YBCO thin film with a hexagonal array
of columnar defects with 30 nm spacings. The periodic pinning landscape was
engineered by a focused beam of 30 keV He$^+$ ions in a helium-ion microscope.

The observation of magnetic diode behavior with ultra-low forward voltage of
5 mV renders new venue for energetically efficient spintronic device research
in the unconventional system of two-dimensional permalloy honeycomb lattice.
Detailed understanding of temperature and magnetic field tuning of diode
behavior is imperative to any practical application. Here, we report a
comprehensive study in this regard by performing electrical measurements on
magnetic diode sample as functions of temperature and magnetic field. Magnetic
diode is found to persist across the broad temperature range. Magnetic field
application unveils a peculiar reentrant characteristic where diode behavior is
suppressed in remnant field but reappears after warming to room temperature.
Analysis of I-V data suggests a modest energy gap, 0.03-0.1 eV, which is
comparable to magnetic Coulomb's interaction energy between emergent magnetic
charges on honeycomb vertices in the reverse biased state. It affirms the role
of magnetic charge correlation in unidirectional conduction in 2D honeycomb
lattice. The experimental results are expected to pave way for the utilization
of magnetic diode in next generation spintronic device applications.

<br>
Electrical breakdown of a dielectric nanolayer between film electrodes under
the combined action of direct current and capacitor discharge current makes it
possible to form Josephson bridges with a reproducible resistance exceeding 1
{\Omega}. A new feature of the formation of a bridge during electrical
breakdown, which is preceded by a series of preliminary breakdowns (auto
breakdowns) of a dielectric nanolayer, has been discovered. The mechanism of
the process and the role of the thickness of the cathode film in the formation
of the bridge are discussed.

<br>
Monolithic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a promising solution for
the industrial implementation of this emerging class of multifunctional
materials, due to their structural stability. When compared to MOF powders,
monoliths exhibit other intriguing properties like hierarchical porosity, that
significantly improves volumetric adsorption capacity. The mechanical
characterization of MOF monoliths plays a pivotal role in their industrial
expansion, but so far, several key aspects remain unclear. In particular, the
fracture behavior of MOF monoliths has not been explored. In this work, we
studied the initiation and propagation of cracks in four prototypical MOF
monoliths, namely ZIF-8, HKUST-1, MIL-68 and MOF-808. We observed that shear
faults inside the contact area represent the main failure mechanism of MOF
monoliths and are the source of radial cracks. MIL-68 and MOF-808 showed a
remarkably high resistance to cracking, which can be ascribed to their
consolidated nanostructure.

<br>
Following a nonperturbative formulation of strong-field QED developed in our
earlier works, and using the Dirac model of the graphene, we construct a
reduced QED_{3,2} to describe one species of the Dirac fermions in the graphene
interacting with an external electric field and photons. On this base, we
consider the photon emission in this model and construct closed formulas for
the total probabilities. Using the derived formulas, we study probabilities for
the photon emission by an electron and for the photon emission accompanying the
vacuum instability in the quasiconstant electric field that acts in the
graphene plane during the time interval T. We study angular and polarization
distribution of the emission as well as emission characteristics in a high
frequency and low frequency approximations. We analyze the applicability of the
presented calculations to the graphene physics in laboratory conditions. In
fact, we are talking about a possible observation of the Schwinger effect in
these conditions.

<br>
Fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) exemplify exotic phases of
low-disorder two-dimensional (2D) electron systems when electron-electron
interaction dominates over the thermal and kinetic energies. Particularly
intriguing among the FQHSs are those observed at even-denominator Landau level
filling factors, as their quasi-particles are generally believed to obey
non-Abelian statistics and be of potential use in topological quantum
computing. Such states, however, are very rare and fragile, and are typically
observed in the excited Landau level of 2D electron systems with the lowest
amount of disorder. Here we report the observation of a new and unexpected
even-denominator FQHS at filling factor {\nu} = 3/4 in a GaAs 2D hole system
with an exceptionally high quality (mobility). Our magneto-transport
measurements reveal a strong minimum in the longitudinal resistance at {\nu} =
3/4, accompanied by a developing Hall plateau centered at (h/e2)/(3/4). This
even-denominator FQHS is very unusual as it is observed in the lowest Landau
level and in a 2D hole system. While its origin is unclear, it is likely a
non-Abelian state, emerging from the residual interaction between composite
fermions.

<br>
In connection with recent experiments on excitation in which Mott insulators
change to conductors, we study the properties of excited states beyond the Mott
gap as quasi-stationary states for a two-dimensional Hubbard (t-t'-U) model at
half filling. A variational Monte Carlo method is used with trial wave
functions for paramagnetic or normal (PM), superconducting with dx2-y2-wave
(d-SC), isotropic s-wave, and extended s-wave symmetries, and antiferromagnetic
(AF) states. The excited states are generated by imposing a minimum number of
doubly occupied sites (doublons) D_L on the lowest-energy states. For U>W (W:
band width), d_L=D_L/Ns (Ns: number of sites) corresponds to the excitation
intensity. It is found that the AF state is the most stable among the states we
treated for d_L<0.14 and insulating. The PM and d-SC states become conductive
over a threshold d_Lc, and the conduction is caused by unbound doublons and
holons (empty sites). The PM state arises for d_L>0.14, but the d-SC state is
always hidden by the AF state. The s-wave-type superconducting states are not
stabilized for any parameter set.

<h3>Fast time-domain current measurement for quantum dot charge sensing  using a homemade cryogenic transimpedance amplifier</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03333" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03333</a>
<br>
<i>Heorhii Bohuslavskyi, Masayuki Hashisaka, Takase Shimizu, Takafumi Akiho, Koji Muraki, Norio Kumada</i>
<br>
We developed a high-speed and low-noise time-domain current measurement
scheme using a homemade GaAs high-electron-mobility-transistor-based cryogenic
transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The scheme is versatile for broad cryogenic
current measurements, including semiconductor spin-qubit readout, owing to the
TIA's having low input impedance comparable to that of commercial
room-temperature TIAs. The TIA has a broad frequency bandwidth and a low noise
floor, with a trade-off between them governed by the feedback resistance
$R_{FB}$. A lower $R_{FB}$ of 50 k$\Omega$ enables high-speed current
measurement with a -3dB cutoff frequency $f_{-3dB}$ = 28 MHz and noise-floor
$NF = 8.5 \times 10^{-27}$ A$^{2}$/Hz, while a larger $R_{FB}$ of 400 k$\Omega$
provides low-noise measurement with $NF = 1.0 \times 10^{-27}$ A$^{2}$/Hz and
$f_{-3dB}$ = 4.5 MHz. Time-domain measurement of a 2-nA peak-to-peak square
wave, which mimics the output of the standard spin-qubit readout technique via
charge sensing, demonstrates a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 12.7, with the
time resolution of 48 ns, for $R_{FB}$ = 200 k$\Omega$, which compares
favorably with the best-reported values for the radio-frequency (RF)
reflectometry technique. The time resolution can be further improved at the
cost of the SNR (or vice versa) by using an even smaller (larger) $R_{FB}$,
with a further reduction in the noise figure possible by limiting the frequency
band with a low-pass filter. Our scheme is best suited for readout electronics
for cryogenic sensors that require a high time resolution and current
sensitivity and thus provides a solution for various fundamental research and
industrial applications.

<br>
We have investigated hybridized magnon-phonon excitation (magnon polarons) in
spin Seebeck effects (SSEs) in Bi$_x$Y$_{3-x}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$
(Bi$_x$Y$_{3-x}$IG; $x=0$, $0.5$, and $0.9$) films with Pt contact. We observed
sharp peak structures in the magnetic field $H$ dependence of the longitudinal
SSE (LSSE) voltages, which appear when the phonon dispersions are tangential to
the magnon dispersion curve in Bi$_x$Y$_{3-x}$IG. By increasing the Bi amount
$x$, the peak fields in the LSSE shift toward lower $H$ values due to the
reduction of the sound velocities in Bi$_x$Y$_{3-x}$IG. We also measured the
SSE in a nonlocal configuration and found that magnon-polaron anomalies appear
with different signs and intensities. Our result shows composition-tunability
of magnon-polaron anomalies and provides a clue to further unravel the physics
of magnon-polaron SSEs.

<br>
Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are increasingly attracting
interest due to their largely modifiable electronic properties, which can be
tailored by controlling their width and edge structure during chemical
synthesis. In recent years, the exploitation of GNR properties for electronic
devices has focused on GNR integration into field-effect-transistor (FET)
geometries. However, such FET devices have limited electrostatic tunability due
to the presence of a single gate. Here, we report on the device integration of
9-atom wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (9-AGNRs) into a multi-gate FET
geometry, consisting of an ultra-narrow finger gate and two side gates. We use
high-resolution electron-beam lithography (EBL) for defining finger gates as
narrow as 12 nm and combine them with graphene electrodes for contacting the
GNRs. Low-temperature transport spectroscopy measurements reveal quantum dot
(QD) behavior with rich Coulomb diamond patterns, suggesting that the GNRs form
QDs that are connected both in series and in parallel. Moreover, we show that
the additional gates enable differential tuning of the QDs in the nanojunction,
providing the first step towards multi-gate control of GNR-based multi-dot
systems.

We measure superfluid transport of strongly-interacting fermionic lithium
atoms through a quantum point contact with local, spin-dependent particle loss.
We observe that the characteristic non-Ohmic superfluid transport enabled by
high-order multiple Andreev reflections survives even at dissipation strength
greater than the superfluid gap. We develop a model with mean-field reservoirs
connected via tunneling to a dissipative site. Our calculations in the Keldysh
formalism reproduce the observed non-equilibrium particle current, yet do not
fully explain the observed loss rate or spin current.

<br>
Plasmonic sensing in the infrared region employs the direct interaction of
the vibrational fingerprints of molecules with the plasmonic resonances,
creating surface-enhanced sensing platforms that are superior than the
traditional spectroscopy. However, the standard noble metals used for plasmonic
resonances suffer from high radiative losses as well as fabrication challenges,
such as tuning the spectral resonance positions into mid- to far-infrared
regions, and the compatibility issue with the existing complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing platform. Here, we demonstrate
the occurrence of mid-infrared localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in
thin Si films hyperdoped with the known deep-level impurity tellurium. We show
that the mid-infrared LSPR can be further enhanced and spectrally extended to
the far-infrared range by fabricating two-dimensional arrays of
micrometer-sized antennas in a Te-hyperdoped Si chip. Since Te-hyperdoped Si
can also work as an infrared photodetector, we believe that our results will
unlock the route toward the direct integration of plasmonic sensors with the
one-chip CMOS platform, greatly advancing the possibility of mass manufacturing
of high-performance plasmonic sensing systems.

<br>
B20-type MnSi is the prototype magnetic skyrmion material. Thin films of MnSi
show a higher Curie temperature than their bulk counterpart. However, it is not
yet clear what mechanism leads to the increase of the Curie temperature. In
this work, we grow MnSi films on Si(100) and Si(111) substrates with a broad
variation in their structures. By controlling the Mn thickness and annealing
parameters, the pure MnSi phase of polycrystalline and textured nature as well
as the mixed phase of MnSi and MnSi1.7 are obtained. Surprisingly, all these
MnSi films show an increased Curie temperature of up to around 43 K. The Curie
temperature is likely independent of the structural parameters within our
accessibility including the film thickness above a threshold, strain, cell
volume and the mixture with MnSi1.7. However, a pronounced phonon softening is
observed for all samples, which can tentatively be attributed to slight Mn
excess from stoichiometry, leading to the increased Curie temperature.

<br>
<i>Lukas P. A. Krisna, Mikito Koshino</i>
<br>
We theoretically study in-plane acoustic phonons of graphene/hexagonal boron
nitride moir\'e superlattice by using a continuum model. We demonstrate that
the original phonon bands of individual layers are strongly hybridized and
reconstructed into moir\'e phonon bands consisting of dispersive bands and flat
bands. The phonon band structure can be effectively described by a spring-mass
network model to simulate the motion of moir\'e domain walls, where the
flat-band modes are interpreted as vibrations of independent, decoupled
strings. We also show that the moir\'e phonon has angular momentum due to the
inversion symmetry breaking by hBN, with high amplitudes concentrated near
narrow gap region. Finally, we apply the same approach to twisted bilayer
graphene, and we find a notable difference between the origins of the flat-band
modes in G/hBN and TBG, reflecting distinct geometric structures of domain
pattern.

<br>
In 2D systems with a spin-orbit interaction, magnetic focussing can be used
to create a spatial separation of particles with different spin. Here we
measure hole magnetic focussing for two different magnitudes of the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction. We find that when the Rashba spin-orbit magnitude is
large there is significant attenuation of one of the focussing peaks, which is
conventionally associated with a change in the spin polarisation. We instead
show that in hole systems with a $k^3$ spin-orbit interaction, this peak
suppression is due to a change in the scattering of one spin state, not a
change in spin polarisation. We also show that the change in scattering length
extracted from magnetic focussing is consistent with results obtained from
measurements of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This result suggests that
scattering must be considered when relating focussing peak amplitude to spin
polarisation in hole systems

<i>Haibo Xue, Zehua Chen, Shuxia Tao, Geert Brocks</i>
<br>
Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid iodide 2D perovskites are put forward as stable
alternatives to their 3D counterparts. Using first-principles calculations, we
demonstrate that equilibrium concentrations of point defects in the 2D
perovskites PEA$_2$PbI$_4$, BA$_2$PbI$_4$, and PEA$_2$SnI$_4$ (PEA: phenethyl
ammonium, BA: butylammonium), are much lower than in comparable 3D perovskites.
Bonding disruptions by defects are more detrimental in 2D than in 3D networks,
making defect formation energetically more costly. The stability of 2D Sn
iodide perovskites can be further enhanced by alloying with Pb. Should,
however, point defects emerge in sizable concentrations as a result of
nonequilibrium growth conditions, for instance, then those defects hamper the
optoelectronic performance of the 2D perovskites, as they introduce deep traps.
We suggest that trap levels are responsible for the broad sub-bandgap emission
in 2D perovskites observed in experiments.

Monolayer NaCrX2 (X=Te,Se,S) were theoretically proposed to be
two-dimensional intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors while their physical
properties have not been thoroughly investigated in bulk single crystals. We
report the single-crystal growth, structural, magnetic and electronic transport
properties of NaCr(Te1-xSex)2 (0 6 x 6 1) and NaCrS2. For NaCr(Te1-xSex)2, the
strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of NaCrTe2 can be gradually tuned to
be a nearly isotropic one by Se-doping. Meanwhile, a systematic change in the
conductivity with increasing x is observed, displaying a doping-induced
metal-insulator-like transition. Under magnetic field larger than 30 koe, both
NaCrTe2 and NaCrSe2 can be polarized to a ferromagnetic state. While for
NaCrS2, robust antiferromagnetism is observed up to 70 kOe and two
field-induced metamagnetic transitions are identified along H||ab. These
intriguing properties together with the potential to be exfoliated down to
few-layer thickness make NaCrX2 (X=Te,Se,S) promising for exploring spintronic
applications.

Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool in
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), but RHEED images are often difficult to
interpret, requiring experienced operators. We present an approach for
automated surveillance of GaAs substrate deoxidation in MBE using deep learning
based RHEED image-sequence classification. Our approach consists of an
non-supervised auto-encoder (AE) for feature extraction, combined with a
supervised convolutional classifier network. We demonstrate that our
lightweight network model can accurately identify the exact deoxidation moment.
Furthermore we show that the approach is very robust and allows accurate
deoxidation detection during months without requiring re-training. The main
advantage of the approach is that it can be applied to raw RHEED images without
requiring further information such as the rotation angle, temperature, etc.

Electron flying qubits are envisioned as potential information link within a
quantum computer, but also promise -- alike photonic approaches -- a
self-standing quantum processing unit. In contrast to its photonic counterpart,
electron-quantum-optics implementations are subject to Coulomb interaction,
which provide a direct route to entangle the orbital or spin degree of freedom.
However, the controlled interaction of flying electrons at the single particle
level has not yet been established experimentally. Here we report antibunching
of a pair of single electrons that is synchronously shuttled through a circuit
of coupled quantum rails by means of a surface acoustic wave. The in-flight
partitioning process exhibits a reciprocal gating effect which allows us to
ascribe the observed repulsion predominantly to Coulomb interaction. Our
single-shot experiment marks an important milestone on the route to realise a
controlled-phase gate for in-flight quantum manipulations.

<br>
<i>Aditya Vats, Sanjay Puri, Varsha Banerjee</i>
<br>
The biaxial phase in nematic liquid crystals has been elusive for several
decades after its prediction in the 1970s. A recent experimental breakthrough
was achieved by Liu et al. [PNAS 113, 10479 (2016)] in a liquid crystalline
medium with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). They exploited the different length
scales of dipolar and magneto-nematic interactions to obtain an equilibrium
state where the magnetic moments are at an angle to the nematic director. This
tilt introduces a second distinguished direction for orientational ordering or
biaxiality in the two-component system. Using coarse-grained Ginzburg-Landau
free energy models for the nematic and magnetic fields, we provide a
theoretical framework which allows for the manipulation of morphologies and
quantitative estimates of biaxial order.

We derive a low-energy effective $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonians for
monolayer C$_{3}$N at the $ \Gamma $ and $ M $ points of the Brillouin zone
where the band edge in the conduction and valence band can be found. Our
analysis of the electronic band symmetries helps to better understand several
results of recent ab-initio calculations[1,2] for the optical properties of
this material. We also calculate the Landau level spectrum. We find that the
Landau level spectrum in the degenerate conduction bands at the $ \Gamma $
point acquires properties that are reminiscent of the corresponding results in
bilayer graphene, but there are important differences as well. Moreover,
because of the heavy effective mass, $n$-doped samples may host interesting
electron-electron interaction effects.

Precise control over interactions between ballistic electrons will enable us
to exploit Coulomb interactions in novel ways, to develop high-speed sensing,
to reach a non-linear regime in electron quantum optics and to realise schemes
for fundamental two-qubit operations on flying electrons. Time-resolved
collisions between electrons have been used to probe the indistinguishability,
Wigner function and decoherence of single electron wavepackets. Due to the
effects of screening, none of these experiments were performed in a regime
where Coulomb interactions were particularly strong. Here we explore the
Coulomb collision of two high energy electrons in counter-propagating ballistic
edge states. We show that, in this kind of unscreened device, the partitioning
probabilities at different electron arrival times and barrier height are shaped
by Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. This prevents the wavepacket
overlap required for the manifestation of fermionic exchange statistics but
suggests a new class of devices for studying and manipulating interactions of
ballistic single electrons.

We report deterministic control over moir\'e superlattice geometry in twisted
bilayer graphene by implementing designable device-level heterostrain with
process-induced strain engineering. We quantify strain and moir\'e interference
with Raman spectroscopy through in-plane and moir\'e-activated phonon mode
shifts. Results support systematic C$_{3}$ rotational symmetry breaking and
tunable periodicity in moir\'e superlattices under the application of uniaxial
or biaxial heterostrain, confirmed with density functional theory based first
principles calculations. This provides a method to not only tune moir\'e
interference without additional twisting, but also allows for a systematic
pathway to explore new van der Waals based moir\'e superlattice symmetries by
deterministic design.

<h3>Interactions between polyelectrolytes mediated by ordering and  orientation of multivalent non-spherical ions in salt solutions</h3>

<br>

<br>
Multivalent ions in solutions with polyelectrolytes (PE) induce electrostatic
correlations that can drastically change ion distributions around the PEs and
their mutual interactions. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations,
we show how in addition to valency, ion shape and concentration can be
harnessed as tools to control like-charged PE-PE interactions. We demonstrate a
correlation between the orientational ordering of aspherical ions and how they
mediate the effective PE-PE attraction induced by multivalency. The interaction
type, strength, and range can thus be externally controlled in ionic solutions.
Our results can be used as generic guidelines to tune the self-assembly of
like-charged polyelectrolytes by variation of the characteristics of the ions.

<h3>Trivial Andreev band mimicking topological bulk gap reopening in the  non-local conductance of long Rashba nanowires</h3>

<br>
<i>Richard Hess, Henry F. Legg, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja</i>
<br>
We consider a one-dimensional Rashba nanowire in which multiple Andreev bound
states in the bulk of the nanowire form an Andreev band. We show that, under
certain circumstances, this trivial Andreev band can produce an apparent
closing and reopening signature of the bulk band gap in the non-local
conductance of the nanowire. Furthermore, we show that the existence of the
trivial bulk reopening signature (BRS) in non-local conductance is essentially
unaffected by the additional presence of trivial zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) in the
local conductance at either end of the nanowire. The simultaneous occurrence of
a trivial BRS and ZBPs mimics the basic features required to pass the so-called
"topological gap protocol". Our results therefore provide a topologically
trivial minimal model by which the applicability of this protocol can be
benchmarked.

Frustrated quantum magnets may exhibit fascinating collective phenomena. The
main goal of this dissertation is to provide conclusive evidence for the
emergence of novel phases of matter like quantum spin liquids in local quantum
spin models. We develop novel algorithms for large-scale Exact Diagonalization
computations. Sublattice coding methods for efficient use of lattice symmetries
in the procedure of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix are proposed and
suggest a randomized distributed memory parallelization strategy. Benchmarks of
computations on various supercomputers with system size up to 50 spin-1/2
particles have been performed. Results concerning the emergence of a chiral
spin liquid in a frustrated kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet are presented.
The stability and extent of this phase are discussed. In an extended Heisenberg
model on the triangular lattice, we establish another chiral spin liquid phase.
We discuss the special case of the Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model and present a
scenario where the critical point of phase transition from the 120-degree
N\'eel to a putative $\mathbf{Z}_2$ spin liquid is described by a Dirac spin
liquid. A generalization of the SU(2) Heisenberg model with SU(N) degrees of
freedom on the triangular lattice with an additional ring-exchange term is
discussed. We present our contribution to the project and the final results
that suggest a series of chiral spin liquid phases in an extended parameter
range. Finally, we present preliminary data from a Quantum Monte Carlo study of
an SU(N) version of the J-Q model on a square lattice for N=2,...,10, and
multi-column representations. We establish the phase boundary between the
N\'eel ordered phase and the disordered phases. The disordered phase in the
four-column representation is expected to be a two-dimensional analog of the
Haldane phase for the spin-1 Heisenberg chain.

<br>
The spin-1/2 Heisenberg model is formulated in terms of a mean-field
approximation (MFA) by using the matrix forms of spin operators
$\hat{S}_x,\hat{S}_y$ and $\hat{S}_z$ in three-dimensions. The considered
Hamiltonian consists of bilinear exchange interaction parameters
$(J_x,J_y,J_z)$, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
$(\Delta_x,\Delta_y,\Delta_z)$ and external magnetic field components
$(H_x,H_y,H_z)$. The magnetization and its components are obtained in the MFA
with the general anisotropic case with $J_x\neq J_y \neq J_z$ for various
values of coordination numbers $q$. Then, the thermal variations of
magnetizations are investigated in detail to obtain the phase diagrams of the
model for the isotropic case with $J_x=J_y=J_z>0$. It is found that the model
exhibits ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, random phase regions and an extra
ferromagnetic phase at which the components of magnetizations present
branching.

<br>
We study magnon bands in the slab geometry for the spin model on the
pyrochlore lattice with Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
and spin-ice anisotropy. For a range of model parameters, for both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange, we evaluate spin wave bands for
slabs oriented perpendicular to the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. We
analyze magnon dispersions for the ferromagnetic splay phase, the
all-in-all-out phase and a coplanar phase. For all the phases considered,
depending on the slab geometry the magnon band structure can be non-reciprocal
and we locate regions of non-reciprocity in the surface Brillouin zones. We
provide details of the edge localized magnons in these phases associated with
point degeneracies and different nodal lines in the bulk spectra.

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) describes the interaction between an electron's
motion and its spin, and is ubiquitous in condensed matter systems. The
interplay of SOC with superconductivity has attracted significant interest over
the past decade and understanding has substantially progressed, both
experimentally and theoretically. Even with well-understood materials,
conventional $s$-wave superconducting hybrid structures with SOC provide a
platform for realizing exotic phenomena and counterparts in the normal state.
Understanding the emergent phenomena in such systems is an important aim in
condensed matter physics. One such area relates to the generation and interplay
of spin-polarized spin-triplet Cooper pairs in superconducting structures with
magnetic interfaces. It is established that certain forms of magnetic
inhomogeneity at an $s$-wave superconductor interface with a ferromagnet can
transform spin-singlet Cooper pairs into a spin-polarized spin-triplet Cooper
pairs, enabling transformative concepts for cryogenic computing. Recently,
theory and experiments have demonstrated singlet-to-triplet pair conversion via
SOC in $s$-wave superconducting structures with or without magnetic layers.
Moreover, the spin-dependent properties of quasiparticles and their
non-equilibrium behavior also change in the presence of SOC. These
breakthroughs create the potential for energy-efficient control of static and
dynamic spin phenomena in superconducting structures and devices. This article
reviews progress in superconducting spintronics with a focus on the coupling of
superconductivity and SOC in hybrid structures and devices, and outlines
directions that are critical for future device development and fundamental
understanding.

<h3>$n$-body Correlation of Tonks-Girardeau Gas</h3>

<br>
For the well-known exponential complexity it is a giant challenge to
calculate the correlation function for general many-body wave function. We
investigate the ground state $n$th-order correlation functions of the
Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gases. Basing on the wavefunction of free fermions and
Bose-Fermi mapping method we obtain the exact ground state wavefunction of TG
gases. Utilizing the properties of Vandermonde determinant and Toeplitz matrix,
the $n$th-order correlation function is formulated as $(N-n)$-order Toeplitz
determinant, whose element is the integral dependent on 2$(N-n)$ sign functions
and can be computed analytically. By reducing the integral on domain $[0,2\pi]$
into the summation of the integral on several independent domains, we obtain
the explicit form of the Toeplitz matrix element ultimately. As the
applications we deduce the concise formula of the reduced two-body density
matrix and discuss its properties. The corresponding natural orbitals and their
occupation distribution are plotted. Furthermore, we give a concise formula of
the reduced three-body density matrix and discuss its properties. It is shown
that in the successive second measurements, atoms appear in the regions where
atoms populate with the maximum probability in the first measurement.

<h3>Dual origin of viscoelasticity in polymer-carbon black hydrogels: a  rheometry and electrical spectroscopy study</h3>

Nanocomposites formed by mixing nanoparticles and polymers offer a limitless
creative space for the design of functional advanced materials with a broad
range of applications in materials and biological sciences. Here we focus on
aqueous dispersions of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles, namely carbon
black (CB) dispersed with a sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food
additive known as cellulose gum that bears hydrophobic groups, which are liable
to bind physically to CB particles. Varying the relative content of CB
nanoparticles and cellulose gum allows us to explore a rich phase diagram that
includes a gel phase. We investigate this hydrogel using rheometry and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CB-CMC hydrogels display two radically
different types of mechanical behaviors that are separated by a critical
CMC-to-CB mass ratio $r_c$. For $r<r_c$, i.e., for low CMC concentration, the
gel is electrically conductive and shows a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum,
pointing to a microstructure composed of a percolated network of CB
nanoparticles decorated by CMC. In contrast, gels with CMC concentration larger
than $r_c$ are non-conductive, indicating that the CB nanoparticles are
dispersed in the cellulose gum matrix as isolated clusters, and act as physical
crosslinkers of the CMC network, hence providing mechanical rigidity to the
composite. Moreover, in the concentration range, $r>r_c$ CB-CMC gels display a
power-law viscoelastic spectrum that depends strongly on the CMC concentration.
These relaxation spectra can be rescaled onto a master curve that exhibits a
power-law scaling in the high-frequency limit, with an exponent that follows
Zimm theory, showing that CMC plays a key role in the gel viscoelastic
properties for $r>r_c$. Our results offer a characterization of CB-CMC
dispersions that will be useful for designing nanocomposites based on
hydrophobic interactions.

<br>
The non-linear response of a beam splitter to the coincident arrival of
interacting particles enables numerous applications in quantum engineering and
metrology yet poses considerable challenge to achieve focused interactions on
the individual particle level. Here we probe the coincidence correlations at a
mesoscopic constriction between individual ballistic electrons in a system with
unscreened Coulomb interactions and introduce concepts to quantify the
associated parametric non-linearity. The full counting statistics of joint
detection allows us to explore the interaction-mediated energy exchange. We
observe an increase from 50\% up to 70\% in coincidence counts between
statistically indistinguishable on demand sources, and a correlation signature
consistent with independent tomography of the electron emission. Analytical
modeling and numerical simulations underpin consistency of the experimental
results with Coulomb interactions between two electrons counterpropagating in a
dispersive quadratic saddle, and demonstrate interactions sufficiently strong,
$U/(\hbar \omega) > 10$, to enable single-shot in-flight detection and quantum
logic gates.

We study the Landau level spectrum of bulk graphene monolayers beyond the
Dirac Hamiltonian with linear dispersion. We consider an effective Wannier-like
tight-binding model obtained from ab initio calculations, that includes
long-range electronic hopping integral terms. We employ the Haydock-Heine-Kelly
recursive method to numerically compute the Landau level spectrum of bulk
graphene in the quantum Hall regime and demonstrate that this method is both
accurate and computationally much faster than the standard numerical approaches
used for this kind of study. The Landau level energies are also obtained
analytically for an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for up to third nearest
neighbor hopping processes. We find an excellent agreement between both
approaches. We also study the effect of disorder on the electronic spectrum.
Our analysis helps to elucidate the discrepancy between theory and experiment
for the high-energy Landau levels energies.

Black holes are arguably the most extreme regions of the universe. Yet, they
are also utterly inaccessible to experimentation, and even just indirect
observation poses significant technical challenges. The phenomenological
approach of thermodynamics is uniquely suited to explore at least some of the
physical properties of such scenarios, and this has motivated the study of
so-called holographic engines. We show that the efficiency of an endoreversible
Brayton cycle is given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency if the engine is fueled
by a 2-dimensional ideal gas; and that the efficiency is higher, if the working
medium is a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. These findings may be relevant
not only in the quest to unlock the mysteries of black holes, but also for
potential technological applications of graphene.

<br>
Packings of macroscopic granular chains capture some of the essential aspects
of molecular polymer systems and have been suggested as a paradigm to
understand the physics on a molecular scale. However, here we demonstrate that
the interparticle friction $\mu$ in granular chain packings, which has no
counterpart in polymer systems, leads to a nontrivial yielding and rheological
response. Based on discrete element simulations we study the nonlinear rheology
of random packings of granular chains under large amplitude oscillatory shear.
We find that the maximum stress and the penetration depth of the shear
deformation into the material bulk are nonmonotonic functions of friction with
extrema at intermediate values of $\mu$. We also show that the regularly
repeated gaps between the adjacent grains, which are special to commercial
granular chains, broaden the shear zone and enhance the entanglements in the
system by promoting the interlocking events between chains. These topological
constraints can significantly increase the degree of strain stiffening. Our
findings highlight the differences between the physics of granular chain
packings and molecular polymer systems.

<h3>Polaron spectroscopy of a bilayer excitonic insulator</h3>

<br>
Recent advances in fabrication of two dimensional materials and their moir\'e
heterostructures have opened up new avenues for realization of ground-state
excitonic insulators, where the structure spontaneously develops a finite
interlayer electronic polarization. We propose and analyze a scheme where an
optically generated intralayer exciton is screened by excitations out of the
excitonic insulator to form interlayer polarons. Using Quantum Monte-Carlo
calculations we first determine the binding energy of the biexciton state
composed of inter- and intralayer excitons, which plays a central role in
understanding polaron formation. We describe the excitations out of the
ground-state condensate using BCS theory and use a single
interacting-quasiparticle-pair excitation Ansatz to describe dynamical
screening of optical excitations. Our predictions carry the hallmarks of the
excitonic insulator excitation spectrum and show how changing the interlayer
exciton binding energy by increasing the layer separation modifies the optical
spectra.

<br>
The nature of the antiferromagnetic order in the heavy fermion metal
YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, its quantum criticality, and superconductivity, which appears
at low mK temperatures, remain open questions. We report measurements of the
heat capacity over the wide temperature range 180 $\mu$K - 80 mK, using current
sensing noise thermometry. In zero magnetic field we observe a remarkably sharp
heat capacity anomaly at 1.5 mK, which we identify as an electro-nuclear
transition into a state with spatially modulated electronic magnetic order of
maximum amplitude 0.1$\mu_B$. We also report results of measurements in
magnetic fields in the range 0 to 70 mT, applied perpendicular to the c-axis,
which show eventual suppression of this order. These results demonstrate a
coexistence of a large moment antiferromagnet with putative superconductivity.

The fusion rules and braiding statistics of anyons in $(2+1)$D fermionic
topological orders are characterized by the modular data of a super-modular
category. On the other hand, the modular data of a super-modular category form
a congruence representation of the $\Gamma_\theta$ subgroup of the modular
group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We provide a method to classify the modular
data of super-modular categories by first obtaining the congruence
representations of $\Gamma_\theta$ and then building candidate modular data out
of those representations. We carry out this classification up to rank $10$. We
obtain both unitary and non-unitary modular data, including all previously
known unitary modular data, and also discover new classes of modular data of
rank $10$. We also determine the central charges of all these modular data,
without explicitly computing their modular extensions.

<h3>Signature of cubic and linear Rashba in  $\text{LaAlO}_\text{3}$/$\text{KTaO}_\text{3}$ (0 0 1) heterostructure</h3>

<br>
Complex oxide heterostructures, for example, the
$\text{KTaO}_\text{3}$/$\text{LaAlO}_\text{3}$ (KTO/LAO) is an archetypal
example to explore the emergent properties due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in
non-magnetic systems. In this study, we report a first-principles investigation
of the electronic and spintronics properties at the perfect (0 0 1) interfaces
of the $\text{KTaO}_\text{3}$/$\text{LaAlO}_\text{3}$ (KTO/LAO)
heterostructure. We find that the $\text{TaO}_\text{2}^{+}$/$\text{LaO}^{+}$
interface is n-type where the electron-like behavior appears from Ta-5$d_{xy}$
orbital, whereas $\text{KO}^{-}$/$\text{AlO}_\text{2}^{-}$ is p-type interface
contributed by O-2($p_{y}+p_{z}$) orbitals. Due to the lack of inversion
symmetry associated with both the interfaces, we have found substantial spin
splittings in this system in the presence of the SOC. The Rashba spin splitting
in n-type interface is contributed by the unoccupied $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$
band of Ta atom, which is cubic in nature. However, the p-type interface
demonstrates a combination of the cubic and linear kind of Rashba splitting and
are present in $d_{yz}$/$d_{xz}$ and ($p_{y}+p_{z}$)/($p_{x}+p_{y}$) bands. We
have observed that the strength of the spin-orbit coupling is dependent on
energy in case of modified linear Rashba. Furthermore, such interface with two
dimensional hole gas (2DHG) exhibits a rich platform for spin-orbitronics and
opto-spintronics applications due to the presence of circularly polarized
photogalvanic effect (CGPE).

<h3>Gapped Lineon and Fracton Models on Graphs</h3>

We introduce a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ stabilizer code that can be defined on any
spatial lattice of the form $\Gamma\times C_{L_z}$, where $\Gamma$ is a general
graph. We also present the low-energy limit of this stabilizer code as a
Euclidean lattice action, which we refer to as the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$
Laplacian model. It is gapped, robust (i.e., stable under small deformations),
and has lineons. Its ground state degeneracy (GSD) is expressed in terms of a
"mod $N$-reduction" of the Jacobian group of the graph $\Gamma$. In the special
case when space is an $L\times L\times L_z$ cubic lattice, the logarithm of the
GSD depends on $L$ in an erratic way and grows no faster than $O(L)$. We also
discuss another gapped model, the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model, which can be
defined on any graph. It has fractons and a similarly strange GSD.
