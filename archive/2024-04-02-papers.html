<p>We simulate phase separated fluids using the Cahn-Hillard fluctuating
hydrodynamic (CH-FHD) model and measure the statistical properties of capillary
waves generated by thermal fluctuations. Our measurements are in good agreement
with stochastic lubrication theory and molecular dynamics simulations but
differ significantly from recent CH-FHD results by Zhang et al. (Phys. Rev. E
109 024208 (2024)). Specifically, we find that capillary wave statistics at
thermodynamic equilibrium are independent of transport properties, namely
viscosity and species diffusion.

<h3>The Exotic Quasisolidity and Supersolidity of Water</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01309" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01309</a>
<br>
</p><i>CQ Sun</i>
<p>Water is ubiquitously important but least known. This perspective features
the latest finding of two exotic forms of water called quasisolid and
supersolid phases due to the cooperativity and disparity of the O:H-O bond in
its segmental length, energy, and specific heat when subjected to thermal,
electric, and undercoordination perturbation. The quasisolid (QS) phase only
appears at temperatures between melting and ice nucleation, regardless of
sample size, and this phase has a negative thermal expansivity (NTE). However,
polarization or molecular undercoordination creates the supersolid phase in
skins of water and ice, droplets, ionic hydration cells, and volumetric water
with a current flow or under a 106 eV/cm electric bias. This phase is
characterized by ~10% H-O bond contraction and vibrating at ~3450 cm-1. The
supersolid has unique properties such as high elasticity, mechanical strength,
optical reflectivity, structure order, thermal stability, diffusivity,
catalytic activity, and chemical reactivity. Liquid-QS-Ice transition with QS
phase energy absorption occurs for water due to H-O bond contraction during
thermal decay but not for the supersolid phase of saturated NaCl solution. The
NTE of the QS fosters ice buoyancy and the supersolidity endows ice
slipperiness, supercooling, superheating, premelting, low-temperature fiber
elasticity, water bridge, and warm water fast cooling, as well as on water
chemistry.

<p>We present colossal Seebeck coefficient ($S$) and large thermal electron
motivate force (EMF) reproduced by space charge (SC) effect, introducing
multi-Debye lengths into grain boundaries (GBs) of thermoelectric (TE)
materials with phonon drag (PD) effect. Recently colossal $S$ was reported in
several TE materials. In addition, the polarity reversal was also reproduced by
transfer process with inner bias around SP generated from thermal EMF. Colossal
$S$ and EMF for TE material were reproduced by SC model as the functions of
Debye length into GBs, reduced mass: $m^*/m$, and temperature.

</p><i>Yasuko Kawahata</i>
<p>This study delves into the intricate electronic and optical behaviors of
two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb materials, such as Stannen, arsenene,
antimonene, silicene, and bismuthene(bismuth molecule), through the lens of
first-principles calculations(AB Initio Calculations) based on the Kohn-Sham
equations. Focusing on the exchange-correlation potential approximations within
the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, we evaluate the potential of
these materials in digital information control and management. Special
attention is given to the nonlinear optical responses and electronic properties
under the influence of twisted bilayer configurations, external fields, and
varying twist angles. The findings offer novel insights into the design of
advanced digital devices, suggesting a transformative approach to information
technology through the utilization of 2D honeycomb materials.

<h3>Cluster state as a non-invertible symmetry protected topological phase</h3>

</p><i>Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao</i>
<p>We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster
model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category
Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times
\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a
non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians
for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of
qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We
identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces
between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not
exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.

<p>In multilayer moir\'e heterostructures, the interference of multiple twist
angles ubiquitously leads to tunable ultra-long-wavelength patterns known as
supermoir\'e lattices. However, their impact on the system's many-body
electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local
compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting
from supermoir\'e-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong
interactions. By using the supermoir\'e lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin
symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near
$\nu=-2$, possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing
proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoir\'e
lattices as a tunable parameter for designing novel quantum phases and an
effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moir\'e materials.

<h3>Josephson effect in a fractal geometry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01373" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01373</a>
<br>
</p><i>Morten Amundsen, Vladimir Juričić, Jabir Ali Ouassou</i>
<p>The Josephson effect is a hallmark signature of the superconducting state,
which, however, has been sparsely explored in non-crystalline superconducting
materials. Motivated by this, we consider a Josephson junction consisting of
two superconductors with a fractal metallic interlayer, which is patterned as a
Sierpi\'nski carpet by removing atomic sites in a self-similar and
scale-invariant manner. We here show that the fractal geometry has direct
observable consequences on the Josephson effect. In particular, we demonstrate
that the form of the supercurrent-magnetic field relation as the fractal
generation number increases can be directly related to the self-similar fractal
geometry of the normal metallic layer. Furthermore, the maxima of the
corresponding diffraction pattern directly encode the self-repeating fractal
structure in the course of fractal generation, implying that the corresponding
magnetic length directly probes the shortest length scale in the given fractal
generation. Our results should motivate future experimental efforts to verify
these predictions in designer quantum materials.

<h3>A new theoretical approach to disordered Majorana nanowires: Studying  disorder without any disorder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01379</a>
<br>
</p><i>Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>The interplay of disorder and short finite wire length is the crucial physics
hindering progress in the semiconductor-superconductor nanowire platform for
realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZM). Disorder effectively segments
the nanowire into isolated patches of quantum dots (QD) which act as subgap
Andreev bound states often mimicking MZMs. In this work, we propose and develop
a new theoretical approach to model disorder, effectively a spatially varying
effective mass model, which does not rely on incorporating unknown microscopic
details of disorder into the Hamiltonian. This model effectively segments the
wire into multiple QDs, characterized by highly enhanced effective mass at
impurity sites leading to the segmentation of the wire into effective random
QDs. We find that this model can reproduce disorder physics, providing a
crystal clear way to understand the effects of disorder by comparing the mean
free path to the superconducting coherence length. In addition, this model
allows precise control over the disorder regime, enabling us to evaluate the
reliability of topological invariants (TI) in predicting MZMs. We find that TIs
alone may yield a significant false positive rate as indicators for topology in
the actual wire with increasing disorder strength. Therefore, we propose new
indicators to characterize the spatial distribution of the zero-energy state,
emphasizing the key necessity for isolated MZMs localized at wire ends.
Employing this set of new indicators for stringent characterizations, we
explore their experimental relevance to the measured differential conductance
spectra. Our findings highlight the critical role of isolated localized states,
beyond the TI, in identifying topological MZMs. We believe that this approach
is a powerful tool for studying realistic Majorana nanowires where disorder and
short wire length obfuscate the underlying topological physics.

<h3>Enhanced pair-density-wave vertices in a bilayer Hubbard model at  half-filling</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01389</a>
<br>
</p><i>Fangze Liu, Xu-Xin Huang, Edwin W. Huang, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux</i>
<p>Motivated by the pair-density-wave (PDW) state found in the one-dimensional
Kondo-Heisenberg chain, we report on a determinant quantum Monte Carlo DQMC
study of pair-fields for a two- dimensional half-filled Hubbard layer coupled
to an itinerant, non-interacting layer with one electron per site. In a
specific range of interlayer hopping, the pairing vertex associated with PDW
order becomes more attractive than that for uniform d-wave pairing, although
both remain subdominant to the leading antiferromagnetic correlations at
half-filling. Our result sheds light on where one potentially may find a PDW
state in such a model.

<h3>Giant and negative magnetoresistances in conical magnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01401" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01401</a>
<br>
</p><i>Raz Rivlis, Andrei Zadorozhnyi, Yuri Dahnovsky</i>
<p>We study magnetotransport in conical helimagnet crystals. Spin dependent
magnetoresistance exhibits dramatic properties for high and low electron
concentrations at different temperatures. For spin up electrons we find
negative magnetoresistance despite only considering a single carrier type. For
spin down electrons we observe giant magnetoresistance due to depletion of spin
down electrons with an applied magnetic field. For spin up carriers, the
magnetoresistance is negative, due to the increase in charge carriers with a
magnetic field. In addition, we investigate spin dependent Hall effect. If a
magnetic field reaches some critical value for spin down electrons, giant Hall
resistance occurs, i.e., Hall current vanishes. This effect is explained by the
absence of spin down carriers. For spin up carriers, the Hall constant
dramatically decreases with field, due to the increase in spin up electron
density. Because of the giant spin dependent magnetoresistance and Hall
resistivity, conical helimagnets could be useful in spin switching devices.

<h3>Correlation of Structural and Magnetic Properties of RFeO3 (R=Dy, Lu)</h3>

</p><i>Banani Biswas, Pavel Naumov, Federico Motti, Patrick Hautle, Marek Bartkowiak, Ekaterina V. Pomjakushina, Uwe Stuhr, Dirk Fuchs, Thomas Lippert, Christof W. Schneider</i>
<p>In orthoferrites the rare-earth (R) ion has a big impact on structural and
magnetic properties in particular the ionic size influences the octahedral tilt
and the R3+- Fe3+ interaction modifies properties like the spin reorientation.
Growth induced strain in thin films is another means to modify materials
properties since the sign of strain affects the bond length and therefore
directly the orbital interaction. Our study focuses on epitaxially grown (010)
oriented DyFeO3 and LuFeO3 thin films, thereby investigating the impact of
compressive lattice strain on the magnetically active Dy3+ and magnetically
inactive Lu3+ compared to uniaxially strained single crystal DyFeO3. The DyFeO3
films exhibits a shift of more than 20K in spin-reorientation temperatures,
maintain the antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4 phase of the Fe-lattice below the spin
reorientation, and show double step hysteresis loops for both in-plane
directions between 5 K and 390 K. This is the signature of an Fe-spin induced
ferromagnetic Dy3+ lattice above the N\'eel temperature of the Dy. The observed
shift in the film spin reorientation temperatures vs lattice strain is in good
agreement with isostatic single crystal neutron diffraction experiments with a
rate of 2 K/ kbar bar.

<h3>Electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of epitaxial  Sc1-xVxNy thin films grown on MgO(001)</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01417" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01417</a>
<br>
</p><i>Susmita Chowdhury, Niraj Kumar Singh, Sanath Kumar Honnali, Grzegorz Greczynski, Per Eklund, Arnaud le Febvrier, Martin Magnuson</i>
<p>The electronic structure of Sc1-xVxNy epitaxial films with different alloying
concentrations of V are investigated with respect to effects on thermoelectric
properties. Band structure calculations on Sc0.75V0.25N indicate that V 3d
states lie in the band gap of the parent ScN compound in the vicinity of the
Fermi level. Thus, theoretically the presence of light (dispersive) bands at
the {\Gamma}-point with band multiplicity is expected to lead to lower
electrical resistivity while flat (heavy) bands at X-W-K symmetry points are
associated with higher Seebeck coefficient than that of ScN. With this aim,
epitaxial Sc1-xVxNy thin film samples were deposited on MgO(001) substrates.
All the samples showed N substoichiometry and pseudocubic crystal structure.
The N-vacancy-induced states were visible in the Sc 2p XAS spectra. The
reference ScN and Sc1-xVxNy samples up to x = 0.12 were n type, exhibiting
carrier concentration of 1021 cm-3, typical for degenerate semiconductors. For
the highest V alloying of x = 0.15, holes became the majority charge carrier as
indicated by the positive Seebeck coefficient. The underlying electronic
structure and bonding mechanism in Sc1-xVxNy influence the electrical
resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and Hall effect. Thus, the work contributes
to the fundamental understanding of the correlated defects and thermoelectric
properties to the electronic structure in Sc-N system with V alloying.

<h3>Josephson diode effect in a ballistic single-channel nanowire</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01429</a>
<br>
</p><i>Julia S. Meyer, Manuel Houzet</i>
<p>When time-reversal and inversion symmetry are broken, superconducting
circuits may exhibit a so-called diode effect, where the critical currents for
opposite directions of the current flow differ. In recent years, this effect
has been observed in a multitude of systems and the different physical
ingredients that may yield such an effect are well understood. On a microscopic
level, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and a Zeeman field may give
rise to a diode effect in a single Josephson junction. However, so far there is
no analytical description of the effect within a simple model. Here we study a
single channel nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and subject to a Zeeman
field. We show that the different Fermi velocities and spin projections of the
two pseudo-spin bands lead to a diode effect. Simple analytical expressions for
the efficiency can be obtained in limiting cases.

<h3>Wehnelt Photoemission in an Ultrafast Electron Microscope: Stability and  Usability</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01434" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01434</a>
<br>
</p><i>Simon A. Willis, Wyatt A. Curtis, David J. Flannigan</i>
<p>We tested and compared the stability and usability of three different cathode
materials and configurations in a thermionic-based ultrafast electron
microscope: (1) on-axis thermionic and photoemission from a 0.1-mm diameter
LaB6 source with graphite guard ring, (2) off-axis photoemission from the Ni
aperture surface of the Wehnelt electrode, and (3) on-axis thermionic and
photoemission from a 0.2-mm diameter polycrystalline Ta source. For each
cathode type and configuration, we illustrate how the photoelectron
beam-current stability is deleteriously impacted by simultaneous cooling of the
source following thermionic heating. Further, we demonstrate usability via
collection of parallel- and convergent-beam electron diffraction patterns and
by formation of optimum probe size. We find that usability of the off-axis Ni
Wehnelt-aperture photoemission is at least comparable to on-axis LaB6
thermionic emission, as well as to on-axis photoemission. However, the
stability and achievable beam currents for off-axis photoemission from the
Wehnelt aperture were superior to that of the other cathode types and
configurations, regardless of the electron-emission mechanism. Beam-current
stability for this configuration was found to be within 1% of the mean for 70
minutes (longest duration tested), and steady-state beam current was reached
within the sampling-time resolution used here (~1 s) for 15 pA beam currents
(i.e., 460 electrons per packet for a 200 kHz repetition rate). Repeatability
and robustness of the steady-state condition was also found to be within 1% of
the mean. We discuss the implications of these findings for UEM imaging and
diffraction experiments, for pulsed-beam damage measurements, and for practical
switching between optimum conventional TEM and UEM operation within the same
instrument.

<h3>Approach and rotation of reconnecting topological defect lines in liquid  crystal</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01480</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yohei Zushi, Cody D. Schimming, Kazumasa A. Takeuchi</i>
<p>Topological defects are a universal concept across many disciplines, such as
crystallography, liquid-crystalline physics, low-temperature physics,
cosmology, and even biology. In nematic liquid crystals, topological defects
called disclinations have been widely studied. For their three-dimensional (3D)
dynamics, however, only recently have theoretical approaches dealing with fully
3D configurations been reported. Further, recent experiments have observed 3D
disclination line reconnections, a phenomenon characteristic of defect line
dynamics, but detailed discussions were limited to the case of approximately
parallel defects. In this study, we focus on the case of two disclination lines
that approach at finite angles and lie in separate planes, a more fundamentally
3D reconnection configuration. Observation and analysis showed the square-root
law of the distance between disclinations and the decrease of the
inter-disclination angle over time. We compare the experimental results with
theory and find qualitative agreement on the scaling of distance and angle with
time, but quantitative disagreement on distance and angle relative mobilities.
To probe this disagreement, we derive the equations of motion for systems with
reduced twist constant and also carry out simulations for this case. These,
together with the experimental results, suggest that deformations of
disclinations may be responsible for the disagreement.

<h3>Rugged potential of mean force and underscreening of polarizable  colloids in concentrated electrolytes</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Emily Krucker-Velasquez, Martin Z. Bazant, Alfredo Alexander-Katz, James W. Swan</i>
<p>This study uses advanced numerical methods to estimate the mean force
potential (PMF) between charged, polarizable colloidal particles in dense
electrolytes. We observe that when the Debye screening length,
$\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is below the hydrated ion size, the PMF shows
discernible oscillations, contrasting with the expected decay in DLVO theory.
Our findings provide evidence for the existence of anomalous underscreening in
electrostatically stabilized suspensions, potentially having significant
implications for our understanding of colloidal stability and the forces that
govern the behavior of concentrated charged soft matter systems beyond DLVO
theory.

<br>
</p><i>D.V. Khveshchenko</i>
<p>This note addresses the effects of long-ranged and/or retarded interactions
on the bosonic collective modes in the so-called 'strange metals'. Recently,
there have been conflicting reports on the very existence of such stable
collective excitations and their properties. Extending a number of approaches
that were previously used in the analyses of the standard Fermi liquid one
finds evidence for, both, conventional and novel behaviors of the
non-Fermi-liquid counterparts of the zero-, shear-, and other 'sounds'.

<h3>Accurate determination of thermoelectric figure of merit using ac Harman  method with a four-probe configuration</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kenjiro Okawa, Yasutaka. Amagai, Norihiko Sakamoto, Nobu-Hisa Kaneko</i>
<p>The ac Harman method has been used for the direct estimation of dimensionless
thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) through ac/dc resistance measurements.
However, accurate zT estimation with a four-probe configuration is difficult
owing to the occurrence of a thermal phase-delay in the heat flow with a low
frequency current. This study reports an exact solution for zT estimation by
solving the heat conduction equation. The analysis can explain the reverse heat
flow, which is the main source of the error in the four-probe configuration,
and the experimentally obtained behavior of the frequency dependence of zT of
(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$. Approximately 20 % of the error is caused by a thermal
phase-delay, unless an appropriate current frequency and voltage-terminal
position are chosen. Thus, an accurate zT evaluation using a four-probe
configuration at any voltage terminal position is achieved. These findings can
lead to interesting thermoelectric metrology and could serve as a powerful tool
to search for promising thermoelectric materials.

<h3>Structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of triangular-lattice  transition-metal phosphates</h3>

</p><i>Chuandi Zhang, Junsen Xiang, Quanliang Zhu, Longfei Wu, Shanfeng Zhang, Juping Xu, Wen Yin, Peijie Sun, Wei Li, Gang Su, Wentao Jin</i>
<p>The recent discovery of the spin supersolid candidate Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$
stimulates numerous research interest on the triangular-lattice
transition-metal phosphates. Here we report a comprehensive study on the
structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of polycrystalline
Na$_2$$A$$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ ($A$ = Ba, Sr; $T$ = Co, Ni, Mn). X-ray and neutron
diffraction measurements confirm that Na$_2$Ba$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ (NB$T$P)
crystallizes in a trigonal structure, while Na$_2$Sr$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ (NS$T$P)
forms a monoclinic structure with a slight distortion of the triangular network
of $T^{2+}$ ions. The dc magnetization data show that all six compounds order
antiferromagnetically below 2 K, and the N\'{e}el temperatures of NS$T$P are
consistently higher than those of NB$T$P for $T$ = Co, Ni, and Mn, due to the
release of geometrical frustration by monoclinic distortions. Further
magnetocaloric measurements show that trigonal NB$T$P can reach a lower
temperature in the quasi-adiabatic demagnetization process and thus shows a
better performance in the magnetic refrigeration, compared with monoclinic
NS$T$P. Our findings highlight the outstanding magnetocaloric performances of
the trigonal transition-metal phosphates, and disclose two necessary
ingredients for a superior magnetic coolant that can reach an ultra-low
temperature, including a perfect geometrically frustrated lattice and a small
effective spin number associated with the magnetic ions.

<p>Determination of the magnetic structure and confirmation of the presence or
absence of inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) and time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry
is imperative for correctly understanding the topological magnetic materials.
Here high-quality single crystals of the layered manganese pnictide CaMnSb$_2$
are synthesized using the self-flux method. De Haas-van Alphen oscillations
indicate a nontrivial Berry phase of $\sim$ $\pi$ and a notably small cyclotron
effective mass, supporting the Dirac semimetal nature of CaMnSb$_2$. Neutron
diffraction measurements identify a C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure
below $T\rm_{N}$ = 303(1) K with the Mn moments aligned along the $a$ axis,
which is well supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The corresponding magnetic space group is $Pn'm'a'$, preserving a
$\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Adopting the experimentally determined
magnetic structure, band crossings near the Y point in momentum space and
linear dispersions of the Sb $5p_{y,z}$ bands are revealed by the DFT
calculations. Furthermore, our study predicts the possible existence of an
intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect in CaMnSb$_2$, offering a
promising platform to study the impact of topological properties on nonlinear
electrical transports in antiferromagnets.

<p>Magnon spin currents in the ferrimagnetic garnet Tb3Fe5O12 with 4f electrons
were examined through the spin-Seebeck effect and neutron scattering
measurements. The compound shows a magnetic compensation, where the
spin-Seebeck signal reverses above and below Tcomp = 249.5(4) K. Unpolarized
neutron scattering unveils two major magnon branches with finite energy gaps,
which are well-explained in the framework of spin-wave theory. Their
temperature dependencies and the direction of the precession motion of magnetic
moments, i.e. magnon polarization, defined using polarized neutrons, explain
the reversal at Tcomp and decay of the spin-Seebeck signals at low
temperatures. We illustrate an example that momentum- and energy-resolved
microscopic information is a prerequisite to understanding the magnon spin
current.

<p>Processes of diffusion of As and P atoms in InP and InAs, and atomic and
energy structure of group-V vacancies and interstitial P and As atoms in InP
and InAs have been investigated using density functional theory. Formation
energies of group-V vacancies in InP and InAs and P and As interstitial atoms
in InP and InAs have been calculated with hybrid functional. The main types of
migration jumps have been determined, and the energy favorable migration paths
and migration barriers of As and P atoms diffusion in InP and InAs via
vacancies and interstitial atoms have been calculated using climbing image
nudged elastic band method. In the case of diffusion of As and P atoms in InP
and InAs via interstitial atoms the diffusion process occurs via indirect
interstitial mechanism. The migration energy barriers for the vacancy diffusion
mechanism are 1.5-2.0 eV, the migration energy barriers for the interstitialcy
mechanism are 0.3-0.6 eV. The interstitial atoms have higher formation energies
compared to the formation energies of the vacancies, and total activation
energies of the diffusion are comparable for the vacancy and interstitialcy
mechanisms. The obtained results will be useful for modeling of the diffusion
processes in semiconductor structures based on InP and InAs.

<h3>Predicting room-temperature conductivity of Na-ion super ionic  conductors with the minimal number of easily-accessible descriptors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01627" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01627</a>

</p><i>Seong-Hoon Jang, Randy Jalem, Yoshitaka Tateyama</i>
<p>Given the vast compositional possibilities
Na$_nM_mM_{m'}$Si$_{3-p-a}$P$_p$As$_a$O$_{12}$, Na-ion superionic conductors
(NASICON) are attractive but complicate for designing materials with enhanced
room-temperature Na-ion conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K}$. We propose an
explicit regression model for $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K}$ with easily-accessible
descriptors, by exploiting density functional theory molecular dynamics
(DFT-MD). Initially, we demonstrate that two primary descriptors, the
bottleneck width along Na-ion diffusion paths $d_1$ and the average Na-Na
distance $\langle d_{\rm Na-Na} \rangle$, modulate room-temperature Na-ion
self-diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm Na,300K}$. Then, we introduce two secondary
easily-accessible descriptors: Na-ion content n, which influences $d_1$,
$\langle d_{\rm Na-Na} \rangle$, and Na-ion density $\rho_{\rm Na}$; and the
average ionic radius $\langle r_M \rangle$ of metal ions, which impacts $d_1$
and $\langle d_{\rm Na-Na} \rangle$. These secondary descriptors enable the
development of a regression model for $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K}$ with $n$ and
$\langle r_M \rangle$ only. Subsequently, this model identifies a promising yet
unexplored stable composition,
Na$_{2.75}$Zr$_{1.75}$Nb$_{0.25}$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$, which, upon DFT-MD
calculations, indeed exhibits $\sigma_{\rm Na,300K} > 10^{^3}$
S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$. Furthermore, the adjusted version effectively fits $140$
experimental values with $R^2=0.718$.

<p>PCPDTBT nanostructures have been synthesized via template-assisted method and
polymer-melt technique. The morphological, optical and structural properties of
the PCPDTBT have been investigated. Melting polymer was used as a driving force
to infiltrate the Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) template in which the applied

melting time duration is set constant for 30 minutes for each of those melting

temperature however based the morphological investigation, only the first two
melting temperatures, 200 and 250, that can serve the structural without any
broken noticed on the Raman measurement. The optical and structural properties

<h3>Drop impact on wet granular beds: water-content effects on the cratering</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Wei Zhang, Hiroaki Katsuragi, Ken Yamamoto</i>
<p>Drop impact events on wet granular bed show rich variety by changing the
substrate composition. We observe the drop impact onto dry/wet granular
substrates with different grain size (50-400 {\mu}m) and water content (0-22
vol %). Although the impactor condition is fixed (impact velocity: 4.0 m/s,
water drop radius: 1.8 mm), the experiment reveals that the post-impact
behaviors of both impactor and target are strongly affected by the substrate
composition. We sort these behaviors into several phases regarding liquid
splashing and crater shapes left after the event. As these phases show
relevance each other, we measure the mechanical characteristics of the
substrates and find that the onset of splashing and particle ejection are
explained by a fracture of the substrate. Furthermore, we discuss several
timescales of the event to understand more detailed phase separations.
Consequently, we find that the splashing phase and the crater shape are
determined by a competition of the timescales of impact, penetration, and
contact.

<p>Organisms maintain the status quo, holding key physiological variables
constant to within an acceptable tolerance, and yet adapt with precision and
plasticity to dynamic changes in externalities. What organizational principles
ensure such exquisite yet robust control of systems-level "state variables" in
complex systems with an extraordinary number of moving parts and fluctuating
variables? Here we focus on these issues in the specific context of intra- and
intergenerational life histories of individual bacterial cells, whose
biographies are precisely charted via high-precision dynamic experiments using
the SChemostat technology. We highlight intra- and intergenerational scaling
laws and other "emergent simplicities" revealed by these high-precision data.
In turn, these facilitate a principled route to dimensional reduction of the
problem, and serve as essential building blocks for phenomenological and
mechanistic theory. Parameter-free data-theory matches for multiple organisms
validate theory frameworks, and explicate the systems physics of stochastic

<h3>Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation of  Thermo-Osmosis: Enhanced Effects on Polarized Graphene Surfaces</h3>

</p><i>Mehdi Ouadfel, Samy Merabia, Yasutaka Yamaguchi, Laurent Joly</i>
<p>Thermo-osmotic flows, generated by applying a thermal gradient along a
liquid-solid interface, could be harnessed to convert waste heat into
electricity. While this phenomenon has been known for almost a century, there
is a crucial need to gain a better understanding of the molecular origins of
thermo-osmosis. In this paper, we start by detailing the multiple contributions
to thermo-osmosis. We then showcase three approaches to compute the
thermo-osmotic coefficient using molecular dynamics; a first method based on
the computation of the interfacial enthalpy excess and Derjaguin's theoretical
framework, a second approach based on the computation of the interfacial
entropy excess using the so-called dry-surface method, and a novel
non-equilibrium method to compute the thermo-osmotic coefficient in a periodic
channel. We show that the three methods align with each other, in particular
for smooth surfaces. In addition, for a polarized graphene-water interface, we
observe large variations of thermo-osmotic responses, and multiple changes in
flow direction with increasing surface charge. Overall, this study showcases
the versatility of osmotic flows and calls for experimental investigation of
thermo-osmotic behavior in the vicinity of charged surfaces.

<p>We investigate the photocurrent and spectral features in a simplified model
of a Mott photovoltaic system consisting of a multilayered insulating
heterostructure. The central correlated region is coupled to two metallic leads
kept at different chemical potentials. A periodic drive applied to the
correlated region produces excited doublons and holons across the Mott gap
which are then separated by a potential gradient, which mimics the
polarization-induced electric field present in oxyde heterostructures. The
nonequilibrium Floquet steady-state is addressed by means of dynamical
mean-field theory and its Floquet extension, while the so-called auxiliary
master equation approach is employed as impurity solver. We find that impact
ionization, identified by a kink in the photocurrent as function of the driving
frequency, becomes significant and is generally favoured by weak, narrow-band
hybridizations to the leads beyond a certain strength of the driving field. On
the other hand, in the case of a direct coupling to metallic leads with a flat
band, we observe a drastic reduction of impact ionization and of the
photocurrent itself.

<p>We developed an efficient numerical approach to compute the different
components of the orbital Hall responses in disordered materials from the Berry
phase theory of magnetization. We propose a theoretical framework based on the
Chebyshev expansion of Green's functions and the position operator for systems
under arbitrary boundary conditions. The capability of this scheme is
illustrated by computing the orbital Hall conductivity for gapped graphene and
Haldane model in the presence of nonperturbative disorder effects. This
methodology opens the door to realistic simulations of orbital Hall responses
in arbitrary complex models of disordered materials.

<h3>Excitons, Optical Spectra, and Electronic Properties of Semiconducting  Hf-based MXenes</h3>

</p><i>Nilesh Kumar, Miroslav Kolos, Sitangshu Bhattacharya, František Karlický</i>
<p>Semiconducting MXenes are an intriguing two-dimensional (2D) material class
with promising electronic and optoelectronic properties. Here, we focused on
recently prepared Hf-based MXenes, namely Hf$_3$C$_2$O$_2$ and Hf$_2$CO$_2$.
Using the first-principles calculation and excited state corrections, we proved
its dynamical stability, reconciled its semiconducting behavior, and obtained
fundamental gaps by the many-body GW method (indirect 1.1 eV and 2.2 eV,
respectively, direct 1.4 eV and 3.5 eV, respectively). Using the Bethe-Salpeter
equation (BSE) we subsequently provided optical gaps (0.9 eV and 2.7eV,
respectively), exciton binding energies, absorption spectra, and other
properties of excitons in both Hf-based MXenes. The indirect character of both
2D materials further allowed a significant decrease of excitation energies by
considering indirect excitons with exciton momentum along the $\Gamma$-M path
in the Brillouin zone. The first bright excitons are strongly delocalized in
real space while contributed by only a limited number of electron-hole pairs
around the M point in the k-space from the valence and conduction band. A
diverse range of excitonic states in Hf$_3$C$_2$O$_2$ MXene lead to a 4\% and
13\% absorptance for the first and second peaks in the infrared region of
absorption spectra, respectively. In contrast, a prominent 28\% absorptance
peak in the visible region appears in Hf$_2$CO$_2$ MXene. Results from
radiative lifetime calculations indicate the promising potential of these
materials in optoelectric devices requiring sustained and efficient exciton
behavior.

<h3>Stacking of charge-density waves in 2H-NbSe$_2$ bilayers</h3>

<p>We employ ab-initio electronic structure calculations to investigate the
charge-density waves and periodic lattice distortions in bilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$.
We demonstrate that the vertical stacking can give rise to a variety of
patterns that may lower the symmetry of the CDW exhibited separately by the two
composing 1H-NbSe$_2$ monolayers. The general tendency to a spontaneous
symmetry breaking observed in the ground state and the first excited states is
shown to originate from a non-negligible inter-layer coupling. Simulated images
for scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) as well as diffraction/scattering
patterns show signatures of the different stacking orders. This may not only be
useful to reinterpret past experiments on surfaces and thin films, but may also
be exploited to devise ad-hoc experiments for the investigation of the stacking
order in 2H-NbSe$_2$. We anticipate that our analysis does not only apply to
the 2H-NbSe$_2$ bilayer, but is also relevant for thin films and bulk, whose
smallest centro-symmetric component is indeed the bilayer. Finally, our results
illustrate clearly that the vertical stacking is not only important for 1T
structures, as exemplified by the metal-to-insulator transition observed in
1T-TaS$_2$, but seems to be a general feature of metallic layered transition
metal dichalcogenides as well.

<p>Super-hard C5 with lon topology (lon: Lonsdaleite hexagonal diamond) and
characterized by the presence of sp3 and sp2 -like carbon sites is devised from
crystal chemistry and used as template matrix structure for identifying
original carbonitrides C4N and C2N2 with lon topology except for the equiatomic
belonging to a new topology (3,4L147). The steric effect of N(2s2) lone pair is
highlighted in C2N2 in inducing an original structure of largely separated
two-layered stacking of tetrahedra. The investigations based on crystal
chemistry were backed by computations within the quantum density functional
theory DFT. All systems were found cohesive and both mechanically (elastic
constants) and dynamically (phonons band structures) stable. Super hardness
characterizes the carbon allotrope C5 and the nitrides C4N and C2N2.
Metallic-like conductivities and insulating characters were identified.

<p>A Fourier-Matsubara series expansion is derived for imaginary-time
correlation functions that constitutes the imaginary-time generalization of the
infinite Matsubara series for equal-time correlation functions. The expansion
is consistent with all known exact properties of imaginary-time correlation
functions and opens up new avenues for the utilization of quantum Monte Carlo
simulation data. Moreover, the expansion drastically simplifies the computation
of imaginary-time density-density correlation functions with the finite
temperature version of the self-consistent dielectric formalism. Its existence
underscores the utility of imaginary-time as a complementary domain for
many-body physics.

<p>Fatigue crack growth is usually a three-dimensional problem, but it is often
simplified to two dimensions to reduce complexity. However, this study
investigates the relationships between microscopic effects such as crack
kinking, shear lips, and plasticity that are present in reality. Therefore,
crack propagation tests were carried out on 2-mm-thick MT-160 specimens of
AA2024-T3 sheet material in L-T and T-L orientation. Using high-resolution
digital image correlation (DIC), the plastic zone was identified and measured
on the samples surface. The fracture surfaces were then digitized and their 3D
shape characterized. Finite element simulations confirm the presence of a local
mixed-mode I/II/III state along the crack front for a slant or double
shear-fracture type. A derived mapping function enables the determination of
the fracture type from the surface plastic zone, along with the current crack
tip loading during the test. Finally, a transition of the fracture type also
leads to a short-term delay in the crack propagation rate. Based on this
information crack propagation curves are computed with regards to the local 3D
crack orientation.

<p>This study compares thirteen natural and industrial samples of supplementary
or emerging supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs): slag, fly ashes,
pozzolan, obsidian, silica fume, and recycled glass. These materials are used
or are under consideration for decarbonization in cement plants. XRF, XRD and
Raman microspectroscopy were used in order to achieve a deeper understanding of
the structural characterization of SCMs. The changes in position and shape of
the XRD diffuse halos were compared. Raman spectroscopy was used to study the
glass part of the SCM families, to better understand their structure in terms
of depolymerization degree, angle, ring size and incorporations into the
glass.The chemical composition of each glassy part was also estimated using
reverse Bogue calculations. The hump position is correlated with the Raman
shift, and with the XRF bulk or with the calculated glass chemical composition
of SCMs, in terms of CaO/(SiO2+Al2O3) or network modifiers to formers ratios.

</p><i>Huaiqiang Wang, Yiliang Fan, Haijun Zhang</i>
<p>Isolated flat bands with significantly quenched kinetic energy of electrons
could give rise to exotic strongly correlated states from electron-electron
interactions. More intriguingly, the interplay between topology and flat bands
can further lead to richer physical phenomena, which have attracted much
interest. Here, taking advantage of the recently proposed intertwined Dirac
states induced from the anisotropic coupling between top and bottom surface
states of an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin film, we show the
emergence of a high-Chern-number (quasi)flat-band state through Moir\'e
engineering of the surface states. Remarkably, the flat bands are isolated from
other bands and located near the Fermi level. Furthermore, topological phase
transitions between trivial and nontrivial flat-band states can be driven by
tuning the out-of-plane electric field. Our work not only proposes a new scheme
to realize high-Chern-number flat-band states, but also highlights the
versatility of the intertwined Dirac-cone states.

<h3>Frustration-induced quantum criticality in Ni-doped CePdAl as revealed  by the $μ$SR technique</h3>

<br>
</p><i>I. Ishant, T. Shiroka, O. Stockert, V. Fritsch, M. Majumder</i>
<p>In CePdAl, the 4$f$ moments of cerium arrange to form a geometrically
frustrated kagome lattice. Due to frustration in addition to Kondo- and RKKY-
interactions, this metallic system shows a long-range magnetic order (LRO) with
a $T_{\rm N}$ of only 2.7\,K. Upon Ni doping at the Pd sites, $T_{\rm N}$ is
further suppressed, to reach zero at a critical concentration $x_c \approx
0.15$. Here, by using muon-spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR), we
investigate at a local level CePd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$Al for five different
Ni-concentrations, both above and below $x_c$. Similar to the parent CePdAl
compound, for $x = 0.05$, we observe an incommensurate LRO, which turns into a
quasi-static magnetic order for $x = 0.1$ and 0.14. More interestingly, away
from $x_c$, for $x = 0.16$ and 0.18, we still observe a non-Fermi liquid
regime, evidenced by a power-law divergence of the longitudinal relaxation at
low temperatures. In this case, longitudinal field measurements exhibit a
time-field scaling, indicative of a cooperative spin dynamics that persists for
$x > x_c$. Furthermore, similar to the externally applied pressure, the
chemical pressure induced by Ni doping suppresses the region below $T^*$,
characterized by a spin-liquid like dynamical behavior. Our results suggest
that the magnetic properties of CePdAl are similarly affected by the
hydrostatic- and the chemical pressure. We also confirm that the unusual
non-Fermi liquid regime (compared to conventional quantum critical systems) is
due to the presence of frustration that persists up to the highest Ni
concentrations.

<p>We present an experimental study on optical properties and dynamics of direct
and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells near
the crossover between $\varGamma$- and $X$-valley confined electron states. The
time-integrated photoluminescence experiment at $T=$4.8 K revealed three
simultaneously observed optical transitions resulting from (a) a direct exciton
recombination, involving an electron and a hole states both located in the
$\varGamma$-valley in the quantum well layer, and (b) two spatially and
momentum indirect excitons, comprising of the confined electron states in the
$X$-valley in the AlAs barrier with different effective masses and quantum well
holes in the $\varGamma$-valley. The measured spatial extent, density
dependence and temperature dependence of the structure photoluminescence
revealed characteristics necessary to pinpoint the states' nature and provided
their characterization crucial in future device design. Temporal dynamics
observed in the time-resolved photoluminescence measurement showed the
complexity of the capture and recombination dynamics, largely affected by
nonradiative processes, what is additionally critical in the system's use. This
solid state platform hosting both direct and indirect excitons in a highly
tunable monolithic system can benefit and underline the operation principles of
novel electronic and photonic devices.

<p>To realise the goals of active matter at the micro- and nano-scale, the next
generation of microrobots must be capable of autonomously sensing and
responding to their environment to carry out pre-programmed tasks. Memory
effects are proposed to have a significant effect on the dynamics of responsive
robotic systems, drawing parallels to strategies used in nature across all
length-scales. Inspired by the integral feedback control mechanism by which
E.coli are proposed to sense their environment, we develop a numerical
responsive active Brownian particle (rABP) model in which the rABPs
continuously react to changes in the physical parameters dictated by their
local environment. The resulting generated time series are then used to
classify and characterise their response, leading to the identification of
conditional heteroscedasticity in their physics. We then train recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) capable of quantitatively describing the responsiveness of
rABPs using their 2-D trajectories. We believe that our proposed strategy to
determine the parameters governing the dynamics of rABPs can be applied to
guide the design of microrobots with physical intelligence encoded during their
fabrication.

<p>Alcohol ferrofluids made of ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite (BHF)
nanoplatelets (NPLs) form a unique example of a dipolar fluid - a liquid
magnet. Its formation is induced at a high enough concentration of the NPLs.
The key interactions between the NPLs are long-ranged dipolar magnetic and
screened anisotropic electrostatic. Herein, we report the results on tuning the
isotropic-nematic phase transition (i.e., the NPLs threshold concentration) in
1-butanol ferrofluids of BHF NPLs by affecting the interactions in the
ferrofluids. The threshold concentration was determined by polarizing optical
microscopy (POM) combined with a system for magnetic field manipulation and was
in the range between 4.6 and 6.6 \% (v/v) depending on the ferrofluid. We
observed that the threshold concentration decreased for 0.6 \% (v/v) with a
larger mean diameter of the NPLs, up to 0.6 \% (v/v) with increased ionic
strength of the ferrofluid, and for $\sim$ 2 \% (v/v) with higher saturation
magnetization of the NPLs. We showed that by tuning the parameters affecting
the ferrofluid's interplatelet interactions, we can alter the threshold
concentration for the liquid magnet formation. The results elucidate the
importance of a delicate balance between the repulsive screened electrostatic
and attractive dipolar magnetic interactions for the liquid magnet formation.

<p>The entropy production is commonly used to gauge a system's distance from
equilibrium, but this interpretation lacks formalization due to the absence of
a natural equilibrium measure. This analysis shows that the entropy production
of a Markov system measures its separation from specific equilibrium dynamics.
These reference dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the

entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information
geometry.

<h3>The ground state of electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979</a>

</p><i>Yang Shen, Xiangjian Qian, Mingpu Qin</i>
<p>We perform a comprehensive study of the electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on
cylinders with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We adopt both
periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circumference
direction to explore the finite size effect. We study doping levels of $1/6$,
$1/8$, and $1/12$ which represent the most interesting region in the phase
diagram of electron-doped cuprates. We find that for width-4 and 6 systems, the
ground state for fixed doping switches between anti-ferromagnetic Neel state
and stripe state under different boundary conditions and with system widths,
indicating the presence of large finite size effect in the $t-t'-J$ model. We
also have a careful analysis of the $d$-wave pairing correlations which also
changes quantitatively with boundary conditions and widths of the system.
However, the pairing correlations are enhanced when the system becomes wider
for all dopings, suggesting the existence of possible long-ranged
superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit. The width-8 results are found
to be dependent on the starting state in the DMRG calculation for the kept
states we can reach. For width-8 system only Neel (stripe) state can be
stabilized in DMRG calculation for $1/12$ ($1/6$) doping, while both stripe and
Neel states are stable in the DMRG sweep for $1/8$ doping, regardless of the
boundary conditions. These results indicate that $1/8$ doping is likely to lie

and the stripe phase with higher doping, consistent with the previous study.
The sensitivity of ground state on boundary conditions and size observed in
this work is similar to that in the $t'$- Hubbard model.

<p>Exploration of new dielectrics with large capacitive coupling is an essential
topic in modern electronics when conventional dielectrics suffer from the
leakage issue near breakdown limit. To address this looming challenge, we
demonstrate that rare-earth-metal fluorides with extremely-low ion migration
barriers can generally exhibit an excellent capacitive coupling over 20 $\mu$F
cm$^{-2}$ (with an equivalent oxide thickness of ~0.15 nm and a large effective
dielectric constant near 30) and great compatibility with scalable device
manufacturing processes. Such static dielectric capability of superionic
fluorides is exemplified by MoS$_2$ transistors exhibiting high on/off current
ratios over 10$^8$, ultralow subthreshold swing of 65 mV dec$^{-1}$, and
ultralow leakage current density of ~10$^{-6}$ A cm$^{-2}$. Therefore, the
fluoride-gated logic inverters can achieve significantly higher static voltage
gain values, surpassing ~167, compared to conventional dielectric. Furthermore,
the application of fluoride gating enables the demonstration of NAND, NOR, AND,
and OR logic circuits with low static energy consumption. Notably, the
superconductor-to-insulator transition at the clean-limit
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ can also be realized through fluoride
gating. Our findings highlight fluoride dielectrics as a pioneering platform
for advanced electronics applications and for tailoring emergent electronic
states in condensed matters.

<h3>Determining the chemical composition of diamagnetic mixed solids via  measurements of the magnetic susceptibility</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02012</a>
<br>
</p><i>Miao Miao Zhao, Yang Yang, Na Du, Yu Ying Zhu, Peng Ren, Fei Yen</i>
<p>Mixed solid compounds are employed in a vast array of applications so an
accurate determination of their chemical compositions is of crucial importance.
All current characterization methods require specially-treated samples so the
availability of a more practical method with similar accuracy should alleviate
the quantification process. In this work, we show how the doping concentration
$\delta$ (or isotope concentration) of a mixed solid compound in powdered form,
where both parent compounds are diamagnetic, can be obtained from the
measurement of the mass magnetization. We exploit the additive nature of the
molar magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{Mol}$ and molar mass to construct two
equations with the same two unknowns in the $\chi_{Mol}$ vs. $\delta$ space to
simultaneously solve $\chi_{Mol}$ and $\delta$ of a mixed solid. Eight examples
are provided to show the wide applicability of this method:
NH$_{4(1-\delta)}$D$_{4\delta}$Br (where D = $^2$H),
NH$_4$I$_{1-\delta}$Br$_\delta$,
(NH$_4$H$_2$)$_{1-\delta}$(ND$_4$D$_2$)$_\delta$PO$_4$,
C$_{48}$H$_{22+6\delta}$Br$_{6(1-\delta)}$O$_{32}$Zr$_6$,
[creatine]$_{1-\delta}$[$_D$-glucose]$_\delta$, [$_L$-glutamic
acid]$_{1-\delta}$[$_L$-leucine]$_\delta$, [terephthalic
acid]$_{1-\delta}$[trimesic acid]$_\delta$ and
[p-terphenyl]$_{1-\delta}$[triphenylphosphine]$_\delta$. Experimental errors of
~1.2% were obtained for $\delta$ from average sample masses of 16.6 mg in
powdered form rendering the presented approach an attractive choice for
characterizing the ratios of mixed solids.

<h3>QDarts: A Quantum Dot Array Transition Simulator for finding charge  transitions in the presence of finite tunnel couplings, non-constant charging  energies and sensor dots</h3>

</p><i>Jan A. Krzywda, Weikun Liu, Evert van Nieuwenburg, Oswin Krause</i>
<p>We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability
diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows
for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in
a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through
it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging
energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close
matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package
hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening
the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.

<h3>Granular aqueous suspensions with controlled inter-particular friction  and adhesion</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02071" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02071</a>

</p><i>Lily Blaiset, Bruno Bresson, Ludovic Olanier, Élisabeth Guazzelli, Matthieu Roché, Nicolas Sanson</i>
<p>We present a simple route to obtain large quantities of suspensions of
non-Brownian particles with stimuli-responsive surface properties to study the
relation between their flow and interparticle inter- actions. We perform an
alkaline hydrolysis reaction on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles to
obtain poly(sodium methacrylate) (PMAA-Na) particles. We characterize the
quasi-static macro- scopic frictional response of their aqueous suspensions
using a rotating drum. The suspensions are frictionless when the particles are
dispersed in pure water. We relate this state to the presence of elec-
trosteric repulsion between the charged surfaces of the ionized PMAA-Na
particles in water. Then we add monovalent and multivalent ions (Na+, Ca2+,
La3+) and we observe that the suspensions become frictional whatever the
valency. For divalent and trivalent ions, the quasi-static avalanche angle
{\theta}c at large ionic strength is greater than that of frictional PMMA
particles in water, suggest- ing the presence of adhesion. Finally, a decrease
in the pH of the suspending solution leads to a transition between a
frictionless plateau and a frictional one. We perform Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) to relate our macroscopic observations to the surface features of the
particles. In particular, we show that the increase in friction in the presence
of multivalent ions or under acidic conditions is driven by a nanoscopic phase
separation and the bundling of polyelectrolyte chains at the surface of the
particle. Our results highlight the importance of surface interactions in the
rheology of gran- ular suspensions. Our particles provide a simple, yet
flexible platform to study frictional suspension flows.

<h3>Extreme plasmons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02087</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aakash A. Sahai</i>
<p>Nanosciences largely rely on plasmons which are quasiparticles constituted by
collective oscillations of quantum electron gas composed of conduction band
electrons that occupy discrete quantum states. Our work has introduced
non-perturbative plasmons with oscillation amplitudes that approach the extreme
limit set by breakdown in characteristic coherence. In contrast, conventional
plasmons are small-amplitude oscillations. Controlled excitation of extreme
plasmons modeled in our work unleashes unprecedented Petavolts per meter
fields. In this work, an analytical model of this new class of plasmons is
developed based on quantum kinetic framework. A controllable extreme plasmon,
the surface "crunch-in" plasmon, is modeled here using a modified independent
electron approximation which takes into account the quantum oscillation
frequency. Key characteristics of such realizable extreme plasmons that unlock
unparalleled possibilities, are obtained.

<p>Tuning magnetic properties in layered magnets is an important route to
realize novel phenomenon related to two-dimensional (2D) magnetism. Recently,
tuning antiferromagnetic (AFM) properties through substitution and
intercalation techniques have been widely studied in MPX3 compounds.
Interesting phenomena, such as diverse AFM structures and even the signatures
of ferrimagnetism, have been reported. However, long-range ferromagnetic (FM)
ordering has remained elusive. In this work, we explored the magnetic
properties of the previously unreported Cr-substituted NiPS3. We found that Cr
substitution is extremely efficient in controlling spin orientation in NiPS3.
Our study reveals a field-induced spin polarization in lightly (9%)
Cr-substituted NiPS3, which is likely attributed to the attenuation of AFM
interactions and magnetic anisotropy due to Cr doping. Our work provides a
possible strategy to achieve FM phase in AFM MPX3, which could be useful for
investigating 2D magnetism as well as potential device applications.

<h3>One-dimensional Fermi polaron after a kick: two-sided singularity of the  momentum distribution, Bragg reflection and other exact results</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099</a>
<br>
</p><i>Oleksandr Gamayun, Oleg Lychkovskiy</i>
<p>A mobile impurity particle immersed in a quantum fluid forms a polaron - a
quasiparticle consisting of the impurity and a local disturbance of the fluid
around it. We ask what happens to a one-dimensional polaron after a kick, i.e.
an abrupt application of a force that instantly delivers a finite impulse to
the impurity. In the framework of an integrable model describing an impurity in
a one-dimensional gas of fermions or hard-core bosons, we calculate the
distribution of the polaron momentum established when the post-kick relaxation
is over. A remarkable feature of this distribution is a two-sided power-law
singularity that can correspond to one of two processes. In the first process,
the whole impulse is transferred to the polaron, without creating phonon-like
excitations of the fluid. In the second process, the impulse is shared between
the polaron and the center-of-mass motion of the fluid, again without creating
any fluid excitations. The latter process is, in fact, a Bragg reflection at
the edge of the emergent Brillouin zone. We carefully analyze the conditions
for each of the two cases and derive the asymptotic form of the distribution in
the vicinity of the singularity.

<h3>Quantum Hall effect in a CVD-grown oxide</h3>

<p>Two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) are promising for investigating
correlated quantum phenomena. In particular, 2D oxides provide a platform that
can host various quantum phases such as quantized Hall effect,
superconductivity, or magnetism. The realization of such quantum phases in 2D
oxides heavily relies on dedicated heterostructure growths. Here we show the
integer quantum Hall effect achieved in chemical vapor deposition grown Bi2O2Se
- a representative member of a more accessible oxide family. A single or few
sub-band 2DES can be prepared in thin films of Bi2O2Se, where the film
thickness acts as the sole design parameter and the sub-band occupation is
determined by the electric field effect. This new oxide platform exhibits
characteristic advantages in structural flexibility due to its layered nature,
making it suitable for scalable growth. The unique small mass distinguishes
Bi2O2Se from other high-mobility oxides, providing a new platform for exploring
quantum Hall physics in 2D oxides.

<h3>Reaching Curzon-Ahlborn limit in linear response and Whitney limit in  nonlinear response in edge mode quantum thermoelectrics and refrigeration</h3>

</p><i>Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin</i>
<p>Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal
quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature
probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime,
we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in
both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that
efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. For the first time, we
see that the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear transport
regimes are achieved using quantum point contacts in the same setup.
