<h3>Fate of Boltzmann's breathers: Stokes hypothesis and anomalous  thermalization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09726</a>
<br>
<i>M. I. García de Soria, P. Maynar, David Guéry-Odelin, Emmanuel Trizac</i>
<p>Boltzmann showed that in spite of momentum and energy redistribution through
collisions, a rarefied gas confined in a isotropic harmonic trapping potential
does not reach equilibrium; it evolves instead into a breathing mode where
density, velocity and temperature oscillate. This counter-intuitive prediction
is upheld by cold atoms experiments. Yet, are the breathers eternal solutions
of the dynamics even in an idealized and isolated system? We show by a
combination of hydrodynamic arguments and Molecular Dynamics simulations that
an original dissipative mechanism is at work, where the minute and often
neglected bulk viscosity eventually thermalizes the system, that thus reaches
equilibrium.

<h3>Shear viscosity in interacting two-dimensional Fermi liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09977</a>

<i>Ulf Gran, Eric Nilsson, Johannes Hofmann</i>
<p>In interaction-dominated two-dimensional electron gases at intermediate
temperatures, electron transport is not diffusive as in the conventional Drude
picture but instead hydrodynamic. The relevant transport coefficient in this
regime is the shear viscosity. Here, we develop a numerically exact basis
expansion to solve the Fermi liquid equation, and apply it to compute the shear
viscosity of the electron gas with screened Coulomb interactions. Our
calculations are valid at all temperatures and in particular describe the
response beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit, where perturbative
approaches exist. We show that even in this low-temperature limit, there is a
nonanalytic exchange contribution to the shear viscosity, highlighting the need
for a full nonperturbative solution of the Fermi liquid equation. We hope that
the techniques developed in this work will serve as a platform to determine the
response of interacting Fermi liquids.

<h3>Comparative study of Kondo effect in Vanadium dichalcogenides VX$_2$  (X=Se & Te)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09258</a>
<br>
<i>Indrani Kar, Susanta Ghosh, Shuvankar Gupta, Sudip Chakraborty, S. Thirupathaiah</i>
<p>We report on the electrical transport, magnetotransport, and magnetic
properties studies on the transition metal dichalcogenides VSe$_2$ and VTe$_2$
and draw a comprehensive comparison between them. We observe Kondo effect in
both systems induced by the exchange interaction between localized moments and
conduction electrons at low temperature, resulting into resistance upturn at 6
K for VSe$_2$ and 17 K for VTe$_2$. From the field dependent resistance
measurements we find that the data is fitted best with modified Hamann equation
corrected by the quantum Brillouin function for VSe$_2$, while the data is
fitted best with modified Hamann equation corrected by the classical Langevin
function for VTe$_2$. Interestingly, we observe a contrasting magnetoresistance
(MR) property between these systems across the Kondo temperature. That means,
negative MR is found in both systems in the Kondo state. In the normal state MR
is positive for VSe$_2$, while it is negligible for VTe$_2$. In addition, both
systems show weak ferromagnetism at low temperature due to intercalated V
atoms.

<h3>Non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order in a group-based  cluster state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09272" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09272</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher Fechisin, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Victor V. Albert</i>
<p>Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed
matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly
realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the
microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian
composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times
\text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in
Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at
this http URL]. We show that this state lies in
a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times
\text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality
argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge
modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$
cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based
quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect
product of abelian groups.

<h3>Nanoscale magnetism and magnetic phase transitions in atomically thin  CrSBr</h3>

<p>Since their first observation in 2017, atomically thin van der Waals (vdW)
magnets have attracted significant fundamental, and application-driven
attention. However, their low ordering temperatures, $T_c$, sensitivity to
atmospheric conditions and difficulties in preparing clean large-area samples
still present major limitations to further progress. The remarkably stable
high-$T_c$ vdW magnet CrSBr has the potential to overcome these key
shortcomings, but its nanoscale properties and rich magnetic phase diagram
remain poorly understood. Here we use single spin magnetometry to
quantitatively characterise saturation magnetization, magnetic anisotropy
constants, and magnetic phase transitions in few-layer CrSBr by direct magnetic
imaging. We show pristine magnetic phases, devoid of defects on micron
length-scales, and demonstrate remarkable air-stability down the monolayer
limit. We address the spin-flip transition in bilayer CrSBr by direct imaging
of the emerging antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phase wall and
elucidate the magnetic properties of CrSBr around its ordering temperature. Our
work will enable the engineering of exotic electronic and magnetic phases in
CrSBr and the realisation of novel nanomagnetic devices based on this highly
promising vdW magnet.

<h3>Vacancy-induced tunable Kondo effect in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09286</a>
<br>
<i>Yueqing Chang, Jinjing Yi, Ang-Kun Wu, Fabian B. Kugler, Eva Andrei, David Vanderbilt, Gabriel Kotliar, J. H. Pixley</i>
<p>In single sheets of graphene, vacancy-induced states have been shown to host
an effective spin-1/2 hole that can be Kondo-screened at low temperatures.
Here, we show how these vacancy-induced impurity states survive in twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG), which thus provides a tunable system to probe the
critical destruction of the Kondo effect in pseudogap hosts. Ab-initio
calculations and atomic-scale modeling are used to determine the nature of the
vacancy states in the vicinity of the magic angle in TBG, demonstrating that
the vacancy can be treated as a quantum impurity. Utilizing this insight, we
construct an Anderson impurity model with a TBG host that we solve using the
numerical renormalization group combined with the kernel polynomial method. We
determine the phase diagram of the model and show how there is a strict
dichotomy between vacancies in the AA / BB versus AB / BA tunneling regions. In
AB / BA vacancies, we find that the Kondo temperature at the magic angle
develops a broad distribution with a tail to vanishing temperatures due to
multifractal wavefunctions at the magic angle. We argue that the scanning
tunneling microscopy response in the vicinity of the vacancy can act as a
non-trivial probe of both the critical single-particle states and the
underlying many-body ground state in magic-angle TBG.

<h3>Localisation phase transition in cooperative stochastic resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09307" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09307</a>
<br>
<i>Felix J. Meigel, Steffen Rulands</i>
<p>Fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems accumulate over time. Stochastic
resetting, where the state of a system is reset to extrinsically predefined
conditions at random times, is a paradigm for studying the constraint of
fluctuations. Here, we show that cooperative resetting in many-particle systems
can constrain fluctuations in a self-organized manner. We show that systems
where pairs of particles are reset to their mean position exhibit phase
transitions between delocalized and localized states, which exhibit altered
response and improved search behavior compared to extrinsic resetting.

<h3>Biorealistic Response in Optoelectrically-Driven Flexible  Halide-Perovskite Single-Crystal Memristors</h3>

<p>The transition to smart wearable and flexible optoelectronic devices
communicating with each other and performing neuromorphic computing at the edge
is a big goal in next-generation optoelectronics. These devices should perform
their regular tasks supported by energy-efficient in-memory calculations. Here,
we study the response of the CsPbBr$_3$ halide-perovskite single crystal
fabricated on the flexible polymer substrate and integrated with the
single-walled carbon nanotube thin film electrodes in a lateral geometry. We
show both photodetection functions combined with the synaptic functionality in
our device under the application of hybrid optoelectrical stimuli. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our device exhibits frequency-dependent bidirectional
modification of synaptic weight with a sliding threshold similar to
biologically plausible Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro learning. The demonstrated
optoelectronic synaptic behavior in halide-perovskite single-crystals opens the
opportunity for the development of hybrid organic-inorganic artificial visual
systems.

<h3>Self-Diffusion and Structure of a Quasi Two-Dimensional, Classical  Coulomb Gas Under Increasing Magnetic Field and Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09318</a>
<br>
<i>J. D. Hernández Velázquez, Z. Nussinov, A. Gama Goicochea</i>
<p>The influence of a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the plane of a
quasi two dimensional, low density classical Coulomb gas, with interparticle
potential U of r as 1 over r, is studied using momentum conserving dissipative
particle dynamics simulations. The self diffusion and structure of the gas are
studied as functions of temperature and strength of the magnetic field. It is
found that the gas undergoes a topological phase transition when the
temperature is varied, in accord with the Bohr van Leeuwen BvL theorem, the
structural properties being unaffected, resembling those of the strictly two
dimensional Kosterlitz Thouless transition, with U of r as varying as ln r.
Consistent with the BvL theorem, the transition temperature and the melting
process of the condensed phase are unchanged by the field. Conversely, the self
diffusion coefficient of the gas is strongly reduced by the magnetic field. At
the largest values of the cyclotron frequency, the self diffusion coefficient
is inversely proportional to the applied magnetic field. The implications of
these results are discussed.

<h3>Non-Hermitian delocalization in a 2D photonic quasicrystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09322" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09322</a>
<br>
<i>Zhaoyang Zhang, Shun Liang, Ismael Septembre, Jiawei Yu, Yongping Huang, Maochang Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Min Xiao, Guillaume Malpuech, Dmitry Solnyshkov</i>
<p>Quasicrystals show long-range order, but lack translational symmetry. So far,
theoretical and experimental studies suggest that both Hermitian and
non-Hermitian quasicrystals show localized eigenstates. This localization is
due to the fractal structure of the spectrum in the Hermitian case and to the
transition to diffusive bands via exceptional points in the non-Hermitian case.
Here, we present an experimental study of a dodecagonal (12-fold) photonic
quasicrystal based on electromagnetically-induced transparency in a Rb vapor
cell. The transition to a quasicrystal is obtained by superposing two honeycomb
lattices at 30$^\circ$ with a continuous tuning of their amplitudes.
Non-Hermiticity is controlled independently. We study the spatial expansion of
a probe wavepacket. In the Hermitian case, the wavepacket expansion is
suppressed when the amplitude of the second lattice is increased (quasicrystal
localization). We find a new regime, where increasing the non-Hermitian
potential in the quasicrystal enhances spatial expansion, with the $C_{12}$
symmetry becoming visible in the wavepacket structure. This real-space
expansion is due to a k-space localization on specific quasicrystal modes. Our
results show that the non-Hermitian quasicrystal behavior is richer than
previously thought. The localization properties of the quasicrystals can be
used for beam tailoring in photonics, but are also important in other fields.

<h3>Enhanced optical, structural and antibacterial properties of ZnO doped  TiO2 composites</h3>

<p>Bacterial infections are a common problem in daily life that can affect human
health. Researchers are looking for valuable materials that can help prevent
such infections and environmental pollutants. Thin films are a well-known
application for photocatalytic and biological activity. Therefore, thin-film
formation is an excellent way to address these problems, thanks to its
nanosized thickness and enhanced monolayer or multilayered structure. Titanium
oxide (TiO2) is the most common material used to produce thin films due to its
various traits that enhance the activity of thin films, such as structural and
optical properties. However, the single usage of pure TiO2 has certain
limitations over these problems. Therefore, new techniques, called doping, need
to be implemented to overcome these limitations. Doping is a standard method
for manipulating material properties to provide enhanced functionality. ZnO was
selected as a dopant because of its good bandgap energy and high electron
activity. Thus, this research mainly focused on the differences in
antibacterial, structural, and optical activity between pure TiO2 and ZnO-doped
TiO2. The sol-gel method was used in this research for several different
thin-film deposition methods due to its easy progression at room temperature,
low cost, and homogeneity traits. The antibacterial activity of pure and doped
TiO2 thin films was analyzed using the standard ISO 22196 protocol against
gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Escherichia coli. As a
result, XRD and UV-vis spectrophotometer measurements show that our dopant ZnO
efficiently enhances the bandgap energy of pure TiO2. The correlation between
dispersibility and homogeneity was achieved in the concentration range ZTA-B-R
(5-10).

<h3>Tripartite Phonon-Magnon-Plasmon Coupling, Parametric Amplification, and  Formation of a Phonon-Magnon-Plasmon Polariton in a Two-Dimensional Periodic  Array of Magnetostrictive/Plasmonic Bilayered Nanodots</h3>

<br>
<i>Sreya Pal, Pratap Kumar Pal, Raisa Fabiha, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay, Anjan Barman</i>
<p>Coupling between spin waves (SWs) and other types of waves in nanostructured
magnetic media has garnered increased attention in recent years because of the
rich physics and the potential to produce disruptive technologies. Among this
family of intriguing phenomena, we recently reported a new one: coupling
between SWs and hybridized phonon-plasmon waves, resulting in tripartite
coupling of magnons, phonons, and plasmons. Here, this acousto-plasmo-magnonic
phenomenon is studied in a two-dimensional periodic array of bilayered [Co/Al]
nanodots on a silicon substrate, where the Co is a magnetostrictive constituent
responsive to magneto-elastic coupling and the Al acts as a source of surface
plasmons. Time-resolved magneto-optical-Kerr-effect microscopy revealed
parametric amplification and strong coupling between two spin wave modes
mediated by a hybrid phonon-plasmon wave. The strong coupling forms a new
quasi-particle: the phonon-plasmonmagnon polariton.

<h3>Position operators and interband matrix elements of scalar and vector  potentials in the 8-band Kane model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09349" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09349</a>
<br>
<i>I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</i>
<p>We diagonalize the 8-band Kane Hamiltonian with a proper inclusion of the
interband matrix elements of the scalar and vector potentials. This leads,
among other results, to a modification of the conventional expression for the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength in narrow band semiconductors with the zinc
blende symmetry. We find that in GaAs, at low temperatures, the correct
expression for the SOC strength is actually twice as large as usually
considered. In InSb it is $1.76$ times larger. We also provide a proper
treatment of the interband matrix elements of the position operator. We show
that the velocity operator in a crystal should be defined as a time-derivative
of a fictitious position operator rather than the physical one. We compute the
expressions for both these position operators projected to the conduction band
of the 8-band Kane model. We also derive an expression for the velocity
operator and demonstrate that the SOC strength in it differs from the SOC
strength in the Hamiltonian. The ratio between them is not equal to $1$, as it
is often assumed for the Rashba model. It does not equal $2$ either. The
correct result for this ratio is given by a rational function of the parameters
of the model. This function takes values between $4(23+3\sqrt{2})/73\approx
1.49$ and $2$. Our findings modify a vast number of research results obtained
using the Rashba model and provide a path for a consistent treatment of the
latter in future applications.

<h3>Spatial Confinement Affects the Heterogeneity and Interactions Between  Shoaling Fish</h3>

<i>Gabriel Kuntz, Junxiang Huang, Mitchell Rask, Alex Lindgren-Ruby, Jacob Y. Shinsato, Dapeng Bi, A. Pasha Tabatabai</i>
<p>Living objects are able to consume chemical energy and process information
independently from others. However, living objects can coordinate to form
ordered groups such as schools of fish. This work considers these complex
groups as living materials and presents imaging-based experiments of laboratory
schools of fish to understand how this non-equilibrium activity affects the
mechanical properties of a group. We use spatial confinement to control the
motion and structure of fish within quasi-2D shoals of fish. Using image
analysis techniques, we make quantitative observations of the structures, their
spatial heterogeneity, and their temporal fluctuations. Furthermore, we utilize
Monte Carlo simulations to replicate the experimentally observed area
distribution patterns which provide insight into the effective interactions
between fish and confirm the presence of a confinement-based behavioral
preference transition. In addition, unlike in short-range interacting systems,
here structural heterogeneity and dynamic activities are positively correlated
as a result of complex interplay between spatial arrangement and behavioral
dynamics in fish collectives.

<h3>Emergent fault friction and supershear in a continuum model of  geophysical rupture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09378" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09378</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishek Arora, Amit Acharya</i>
<p>Important physical observations in rupture dynamics such as static fault
friction, short-slip, self-healing, and supershear phenomenon in cracks are
studied. A continuum model of rupture dynamics is developed using the field
dislocation mechanics (FDM) theory. The energy density function in our model
encodes accepted and simple physical facts related to rocks and granular
materials under compression. We work within a 2-dimensional ansatz of FDM where
the rupture front is allowed to move only in a horizontal fault layer
sandwiched between elastic blocks. Damage via the degradation of elastic
modulus is allowed to occur only in the fault layer, characterized by the
amount of plastic slip. The theory dictates the evolution equation of the
plastic shear strain to be a Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equation, resulting in the
representation of a propagating rupture front, which is fully coupled to
elastodynamics in the whole domain. Our simulations recover static friction
laws as emergent features of our model, without putting in by hand any such
discontinuous criteria. Estimates of material parameters of cohesion and
friction angle are deduced. Short-slip and slip-weakening (crack-like)
behaviors are also reproduced as a function of the degree of damage behind the
rupture front. The long-time behavior of a moving rupture front is probed, and
it is deduced that the equilibrium profiles under no shear stress are not
traveling wave profiles under non-zero shear load. However, it is shown that a
traveling wave structure is likely attained in the limit of long times.
Finally, a crack-like damage front is driven by an initial impact loading, and
it is observed in our simulations that an upper bound to the crack speed is the
dilatational wave speed of the material unless the material is put under
pre-stressed conditions, in which case supersonic motion can be obtained.

<h3>Efficient Superconductor Arithmetic Logic Unit for Ultra-Fast Computing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09386" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09386</a>
<br>
<i>Sasan Razmkhah, Ali Bozbey</i>
<p>We present a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) utilizing superconductor
technology. The ALU serves as the central processing unit of a processor,
performing crucial arithmetic and logical operations. We have adopted a
bit-parallel architecture to ensure an efficient and streamlined design with
minimal fanin/fanout and optimal latency. In terms of fabrication, the ALU has
been fabricated using a standard commercial process. It operates at an
impressive clock frequency exceeding 30 GHz while consuming a mere 4.75 mW of
power, including applied reverse current, encompassing static and dynamic
components. The ALU contains over 9000 Josephson junctions, with approximately
7000 JJs dedicated to wiring, delay lines, and path balancing, and it has over
18% bias margin. Designed as a co-processor, this arithmetic logic unit will
work with external CMOS memory and processors via interface circuits. Thorough
testing and validation of the ALU's functionality have been conducted with
digital and analog simulations, and all the components were fabricated and
measured within a 4K pulse-tube cryocooler. Experimental verification has
confirmed the successful operation of both the arithmetic and logic units.
These results have been analyzed and are presented alongside the experimental
data to provide comprehensive insights into the ALU's behavior and
capabilities.

<h3>Automated Grain Boundary Detection for Bright-Field Transmission  Electron Microscopy Images via U-Net</h3>

<br>
<i>Matthew J. Patrick, James K. Eckstein, Javier R. Lopez, Silvia Toderas, Sarah A. Asher, Sylvia I. Whang, Stacey Levine, Jeffrey M. Rickman, Katayun Barmak</i>
<p>Quantification of microstructures is crucial for understanding
processing-structure and structure-property relationships in polycrystalline
materials. Delineating grain boundaries in bright-field transmission electron
micrographs, however, is challenging due to complex diffraction contrast in
images. Conventional edge detection algorithms are inadequate; instead, manual
tracing is usually required. This study demonstrates the first successful
machine-learning approach for grain-boundary detection in bright-field
transmission electron micrographs. The proposed methodology uses a U-Net
convolutional neural network trained on carefully constructed data from
bright-field images and hand-tracings available from prior studies, combined
with targeted post-processing algorithms to preserve fine features of interest.
The image processing pipeline accurately estimates grain-boundary positions,
avoiding segmentation in regions with intragrain contrast and identifying
low-contrast boundaries. Our approach is validated by directly comparing
microstructural markers (i.e., grain centroids) identified in U-Net predictions
with those identified in hand tracings; furthermore, the grain size
distributions obtained from the two techniques show notable overlap when
compared using t-, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Cramer-von Mises tests. The
technique is then successfully applied to interpret new aluminum film
microstructures having different image characteristics from the training data,
and preliminary results from Pt and Pd microstructures are presented,
highlighting the versatility of our approach for grain-boundary identification
in bright-field micrographs.

<h3>Hofstadter Butterfly and Broken-Symmetry Quantum Hall States in  α-Type Organic Dirac Fermion Systems</h3>

<i>Toshihito Osada</i>
<p>The electronic state of \alpha-type organic Dirac fermion systems such as
\alpha-(ET)_2I_3 or \alpha-(BETS)_2I_3 has been studied under magnetic fields
using the four-band tight-binding model with Peierls phase factors. The
validity of the Dirac fermion picture in these materials was confirmed by the
generated Hofstadter butterfly and its Chern numbers. The four-component
envelope function of the N = 0 Landau level with valley degeneracy was studied.
It was found that the two degenerate valley states have different weights on A
and A' molecules connected by inversion. This feature is also recognized for
the N = 0 spin-split Landau levels under the Zeeman effect and the spin-orbit
interaction. The spontaneous valley symmetry breaking in the N = 0 Landau
levels due to the exchange interaction results in the \nu = 1 and -1 quantum
Hall states accompanied by the spatial charge and spin modulations in a unit
cell.

<p>The vibrational properties of 2H-TaSe$_{2-x}$S$_x$ ($0 \le x \le 2$) single
crystals were probed using Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory
calculations. The end members revealed two out of four symmetry-predicted Raman
active modes, together with the pronounced two-phonon structure, attributable
to the enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Additional peaks become observable
due to crystallographic disorder for the doped samples. The evolution of the
E$_{2g}^2$ mode Fano parameter reveals that the disorder has weak impact on
electron-phonon coupling, which is also supported by the persistence of
two-phonon structure in doped samples. As such, this research provides thorough
insights into the lattice properties, the effects of crystallographic disorder
on Raman spectra, and the interplay of this disorder with the electron-phonon
coupling in 2H-TaSe$_{2-x}$S$_x$ compounds.

<h3>Fermionic quartet and vestigial gravity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09435" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09435</a>
<br>
<i>G.E. Volovik</i>
<p>We discuss the two-step transitions in superconductors, where the
intermediate state between the Cooper pair state and the normal metal is the
4-fermion condensate, which is called the intertwined vestigial order. We
discuss different types of the vestigial order, which are possible in the
spin-triplet superfluid $^3$He, and the topological objects in the vestigial
phases. Since in $^3$He the order parameter $A_{\alpha i}$ represents the
analog of gravitational tetrads, we suggest that the vestigial states are
possible in quantum gravity. As in superconductors, the fermionic vacuum can
experience two consequent phase transitions. At first transition the metric
appears as the bilinear combination of tetrads $g_{\mu\nu} =\eta_{ab}< \hat
E^a_\mu \hat E^b_\nu>$, while the tetrad order parameter is still absent,
$e_\mu^a=< \hat E^a_\mu> =0$. This corresponds to the bosonic Einstein general
relativity, which emerges in the fermionic vacuum. The nonzero tetrads
$e_\mu^a=< \hat E^a_\mu> \neq 0$ appear at the second transition, where a kind
of the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble tetrad gravity is formed. This suggests
that on the levels of particles, gravity acts with different strength on
fermions and bosons.

<h3>Emergence of 6-particle "hexciton'' states in WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$  monolayers</h3>

<p>When doped with a high density of mobile charge carriers, monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors can host new types of
composite many-particle exciton states that do not exist in conventional
semiconductors. Such multi-particle bound states arise when a photoexcited
electron-hole pair couples to not just a single Fermi sea that is
quantum-mechanically distinguishable (as for the case of conventional charged
excitons or trions), but rather couples simultaneously to \textit{multiple}
Fermi seas, each having distinct spin and valley quantum numbers. Composite
six-particle ``hexciton'' states were recently identified in electron-doped
WSe$_2$ monolayers, but under suitable conditions they should also form in all
other members of the monolayer TMD family. Here we present spectroscopic
evidence demonstrating the emergence of many-body hexcitons in charge-tunable
WS$_2$ monolayers (at the A-exciton) and MoSe$_2$ monolayers (at the
B-exciton). The roles of distinguishability and carrier screening on the
stability of hexcitons are discussed.

<p>Ultrafast laser excitation provides a means to transiently realize long-range
ordered electronic states of matter that are hidden in thermal equilibrium.
Recently, this approach has unveiled a variety of thermally inaccessible
ordered states in strongly correlated materials, including charge density wave,
ferroelectric, magnetic, and intertwined charge-orbital ordered states.
However, more exotic hidden states exhibiting higher multipolar ordering remain
elusive owing to the challenge of directly manipulating and detecting them with
light. Here we demonstrate a method to induce a dynamical transition from a
thermally allowed to a thermally forbidden spin-orbit entangled quadrupolar
ordered state in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ by coherently exciting a phonon that is strongly
coupled to the order parameter. Combining probe photon energy-resolved coherent
phonon spectroscopy measurements with model Hamiltonian calculations, we show
that the dynamical transition is manifested through anomalies in the
temperature, pump excitation fluence, and probe photon energy dependence of the
strongly coupled phonon. With this procedure, we introduce a general pathway to
uncover hidden multipolar ordered states and to control their re-orientation on
ultrashort timescales.

<p>Electronic topological phases are renowned for their unique properties, where
conducting surface states exist on the boundary of an insulating
three-dimensional bulk. While the transport response of the surface states has
been extensively studied, the response of the topological hinge modes remains
elusive. Here, we investigate a layered topological insulator
$\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$, and provide the first evidence for quantum transport in
gapless topological hinge states existing within the insulating bulk and
surface energy gaps. Our magnetoresistance measurements reveal pronounced h/e
periodic (where h denotes Planck's constant and e represents the electron
charge) Aharonov-Bohm oscillation. The observed periodicity, which directly
reflects the enclosed area of phase-coherent electron propagation, matches the
area enclosed by the sample hinges, providing compelling evidence for the
quantum interference of electrons circumnavigating around the hinges. Notably,
the h/e oscillations evolve as a function of magnetic field orientation,
following the interference paths along the hinge modes that are allowed by
topology and symmetry, and in agreement with the locations of the hinge modes
according to our scanning tunneling microscopy images. Remarkably, this
demonstration of quantum transport in a topological insulator can be achieved
using a flake geometry and we show that it remains robust even at elevated
temperatures. Our findings collectively reveal the quantum transport response
of topological hinge modes with both topological nature and quantum coherence,
which can be directly applied to the development of efficient quantum
electronic devices.

<h3>Efficient Machine Learning Force Field for Large-Scale Molecular  Simulations of Organic Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09490</a>
<br>
<i>Junbao Hu, Liyang Zhou, Jian Jiang</i>
<p>To address the computational challenges of ab initio molecular dynamics and
the accuracy limitations of empirical force fields, the introduction of machine
learning force fields has proven effective in various systems including metals
and inorganic materials. However, in large-scale organic systems, the
application of machine learning force fields is often hindered by impediments
such as the complexity of long-range intermolecular interactions and molecular
conformations, as well as the instability in long-time molecular simulations.
Therefore, we propose a universal multiscale higher-order equivariant model
combined with active learning techniques, efficiently capturing the complex
long-range intermolecular interactions and molecular conformations. Compared to
existing equivariant models, our model achieves the highest predictive
accuracy, and magnitude-level improvements in computational speed and memory
efficiency. In addition, a bond length stretching method is designed to improve
the stability of long-time molecular simulations. Utilizing only 901 samples
from a dataset with 120 atoms, our model successfully extends high precision to
systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms. These achievements guarantee high
predictive accuracy, fast simulation speed, minimal memory consumption, and
robust simulation stability, satisfying the requirements for high-precision and
long-time molecular simulations in large-scale organic systems.

<h3>Three-state active lattice gas: a discrete Vicseklike model with  excluded volume</h3>

<br>
<i>Tiago Venzel Rosembach, Ana Luiza Novaes Dias, Ronald Dickman</i>
<p>We study a discrete-space model of active matter with excluded volume.
Particles are restricted to the sites of a triangular lattice, and can assume
one of three orientations. Varying the density and noise intensity, Monte Carlo
simulations reveal a variety of spatial patterns. Ordered states occur in the
form of condensed structures, which (away from the full occupancy limit)
coexist with a low-density vapor. The condensed structures feature low particle
mobility, particularly those that wrap the system via the periodic boundaries.
As the noise intensity is increased, dense structures give way to a disordered
phase. We characterize the parameter values associated with the condensed
phases and perform a detailed study of the order-disorder transition at (1)
full occupation and (2) at a density of 0.1. In the former case, the model
possesses the same symmetry as the three-state Potts model and exhibits a
continuous phase transition, as expected, with critical exponents consistent
with those of the associated Potts model. In the low-density case, the
transition is clearly discontinuous, with strong dependence of the final state
upon the initial configuration, hysteresis,and nonmonotonic dependence of the
Binder cumulant upon noise intensity.

<h3>Emergence and Growth Dynamics of Wetting-induced Phase Separation on  Soft Solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09493" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09493</a>
<br>
<i>Wenjie Qian, Weiwei Zhao, Tiezheng Qian, Qin Xu</i>
<p>Liquid droplets on soft solids, such as soft polymeric gels, can induce
substantial surface deformations, leading to the formation of wetting ridges at
the contact points. While these contact ridges have been shown to govern the
rich surface mechanics of complaint substrates, the inherently divergent
characteristics at contact points and the multiphase nature of soft reticulated
gels both pose great challenges for continuum mechanical theories in modeling
soft wetting phenomena. In this study, we report in-situ experimental
characterizations of the emergence and growth dynamics of the wetting-induced
phase separation. The measurements demonstrate how the migration of free chains
prevents the stress singularities at contact points. Based on the Onsager
variational principle, we present a phenomenological model that effectively
captures the growth dynamics of this phase separation, including the crossover
from a short-term diffusive state to a long-term equilibrium state. Comparing
the model predictions with the experimental results obtained for varied
crosslinking densities, we reveal how the intrinsic material parameters of soft
gels dictate the phase separation dynamics.

<h3>Osmotic Pressure and Swelling Behavior of Ionic Microcapsules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09515</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammed O. Alziyadi, Alan R. Denton</i>
<p>Ionic microcapsules are hollow shells of hydrogel, typically 10-1000 nm in
radius, composed of cross-linked polymer networks that become charged and
swollen in a good solvent. The ability of microcapsules to swell/deswell in
response to changes in external stimuli (e.g., temperature, pH, ionic strength)
suits them to applications, such as drug delivery, biosensing, and catalysis.
Equilibrium swelling behavior of ionic microcapsules is determined by a balance
of electrostatic and elastic forces. The electrostatic component of the osmotic
pressure of a microcapsule -- the difference in pressure between the inside and
outside of the particle -- plays a vital role in determining swelling behavior.
Within the spherical cell model, we derive exact expressions for the radial
pressure profile and for the electrostatic and gel components of the osmotic
pressure of a microcapsule, which we compute via Poisson-Boltzmann theory and
molecular dynamics simulation. For the gel component, we use the Flory-Rehner
theory of polymer networks. By combining the electrostatic and gel components
of the osmotic pressure, we compute the equilibrium size of ionic microcapsules
as a function of particle concentration, shell thickness, and valence. We
predict concentration-driven deswelling at relatively low concentrations at
which steric interactions between particles are weak, and demonstrate that this
response can be attributed to crowding-induced redistribution of counterions.
Our approach may help to guide the design and applications of smart,
stimuli-responsive colloidal particles.

<h3>Osmotic Swelling Behavior of Surface-Charged Ionic Microgels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09519</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammed O. Alziyadi, Alan R. Denton</i>
<p>In recent years, ionic microgels have garnered much attention due to their
unique properties, especially their stimulus-sensitive swelling behavior. The
tunable response of these soft, permeable, compressible, charged colloidal
particles is increasingly attractive for applications in medicine and
biotechnologies, such as controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering, and
biosensing. The ability to model and predict variation of the osmotic pressure
of a single microgel with respect to changes in particle properties and
environmental conditions proves vital to such applications. In this work, we
apply both nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation
to ionic microgels (macroions) in the cell model to compute density profiles of
microions (counterions, coions), single-microgel osmotic pressure, and
equilibrium swelling ratios of spherical microgels whose fixed charge is
confined to the macroion surface. The basis of our approach is an exact theorem
that relates the electrostatic component of the osmotic pressure to the
microion density profiles. Close agreement between theory and simulation serves
as a consistency check to validate our approach. We predict that
surface-charged microgels progressively deswell with increasing microgel
concentration, starting well below close packing, and with increasing salt
concentration, in qualitative agreement with experiments. Comparison with
previous results for microgels with fixed charge uniformly distributed over
their volume demonstrates that surface-charged microgels deswell more rapidly
than volume-charged microgels. We conclude that swelling behavior of ionic
microgels in solution is sensitive to the distribution of fixed charge within
the polymer-network gel and strongly depends on bulk concentrations of both
microgels and salt ions.

<i>Chi-Hung Lee, Cheng-Yen Lin, Guan-Yu Chen</i>
<p>Unique zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials are valuable for use in
precision instruments, including electronics, aerospace parts, and engines.
However, most ZTE materials have a temperature range less than 1000 K under
which they do not expand. In this study, we present a uniaxial ZTE in the
low-cost Mn2OBO3 with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\alpha$=
-1.7$\times$10^(-7) K-1 along the [h00] direction from 3.5 to 1250 K. The
monoclinic structure of Mn2OBO3 remains stable over the entire temperature
range in ambient conditions. Considerable thermal contraction on the BO3
trigonal planar and thermal expansion on the MnO6 octahedra combine to produce
uniaxial ZTE. No charge order-disorder transition, which could cause thermal
contraction, was observed up to 1250 K.

<h3>Effective interactions, structure, and pressure in charge-stabilized  colloidal suspensions: Critical assessment of charge renormalization methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09543" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09543</a>
<br>
<i>Mariano E. Brito, Gerhard Nägele, Alan R. Denton</i>
<p>Charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions display a rich variety of
microstructural and thermodynamic properties, which are determined by
electro-steric interactions between all ionic species. The large size asymmetry
between molecular-scale microions and colloidal macroions allows the microion
degrees of freedom to be integrated out, leading to an effective one-component
model of microion-dressed colloidal quasi-particles. For highly-charged
colloids with strong macroion-microion correlations, nonlinear effects can be
incorporated into effective interactions by means of charge renormalization
methods. Here, we compare and partially extend several practical mean-field
methods of calculating renormalized colloidal interaction parameters, including
effective charges and screening constants, as functions of concentration and
ionic strength. Within the one-component description, we compute structural and
thermodynamic properties from the effective interactions and assess the
accuracy of the different methods by comparing predictions with elaborate
primitive-model simulations [P. Linse, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 4359 (2000)]. We
also compare various prescriptions for the osmotic pressure of suspensions in
Donnan equilibrium with a salt ion reservoir, and analyze instances where the
macroion effective charge becomes larger than the bare one. The methods
assessed include single-center cell, jellium, and multi-center mean-field
theories. The strengths and weaknesses of the various methods are critically
assessed, with the aim of guiding optimal and accurate implementations.

<h3>Stress correlations in near-crystalline packings</h3>

<br>
<i>Roshan Maharana, Kabir Ramola</i>
<p>We derive exact results for stress correlations in near-crystalline systems
in two and three dimensions. We study energy minimized configurations of
particles interacting through Harmonic as well as Lennard-Jones potentials, for
varying degrees of microscopic disorder and quenched forces on grains. Our
findings demonstrate that the macroscopic elastic properties of such
near-crystalline packings remain unchanged within a certain disorder threshold,
yet they can be influenced by various factors, including packing density,
pressure, and the strength of inter-particle interactions. We show that the
stress correlations in such systems display anisotropic behavior at large
lengthscales and are significantly influenced by the pre-stress of the system.
The anisotropic nature of these correlations remains unaffected as we increase
the strength of the disorder. Additionally, we derive the large lengthscale
behavior for the change in the local stress components that shows a $1/r^d$
radial decay for the case of particle size disorder and a $1/r^{d-1}$ behavior
for quenched forces introduced into a crystalline network. Finally, we verify
our theoretical results numerically using energy-minimised static particle
configurations.

<h3>Summation of Divergent Series and Quantum Phase Transitions in Kitaev  Chains with Long-Range Hopping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09566" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09566</a>
<br>
<i>Hao Fu, Peiqing Tong</i>
<p>We study the quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in extended Kitaev chains with
long-range ($1/r^{\alpha}$) hopping. Formally, there are two QPT points at
$\mu=\mu_0(\alpha)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ ($\mu$ is the chemical potential)
which correspond to the summations of $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}m^{-\alpha}$ and
$\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{m-1}m^{-\alpha}$, respectively. When $\alpha\leq0$,
both the series are divergent and it is usually believed that no QPTs exist.
However, we find that there are two QPTs at $\mu=\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(0)$ for
$\alpha=0$ and one QPT at $\mu=\mu_\pi(\alpha)$ for $\alpha<0$. These QPTs are
second order. The $\mu_0(0)$ and $\mu_\pi(\alpha\leq0)$ correspond to the
summations of the divergent series obtained by the analytic continuation of the
Riemann $\zeta$ function and Dirichlet $\eta$ function. Moreover, it is found
that the quasiparticle energy spectra are discontinue functions of the wave
vector $k$ and divide into two branches. This is quite different from that in
the case of $\alpha>0$ and induces topological phases with the winding number
$\omega:=\pm1/2$. At the same time, the von Neumann entropy are power law of
the subchain length $L$ no matter in the gapped region or not. In addition, we
also study the QPTs, topological properties, and von Neumann entropy of the
systems with $\alpha>0$.

<i>Meng Li, Tao Cheng, Gongze Liu, He Huang, Keqiao Li, Yang Li, Jiayue Yang, Baoling Huang</i>
<p>Visible transparent but infrared reflective materials are ideal candidates
for both transparent conductive films and low-emissivity glass, which are
highly desired in a broad variety of areas such as touchscreens and displays,
photovoltaics, smart windows, and antistatic coatings. Ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene
films are emerging as promising low-emissivity transparent candidates. However,
the fundamental IR properties of Ti3C2Tx has not been revealed experimentally
due to daunting challenges in the preparation of continuous, large-area, and
ultrathin films of optical quality on flat substrates. Herein, we proposed a
tape-free transfer method that can help prepare centimeter-size and ultrathin
(down to 8 nm) Ti3C2Tx films on diverse optical substrates. Benefitting from
this method, the refractive index and permittivity for Ti3C2Tx were
successfully measured. Ti3C2Tx films exhibit large in-plane permittivity in the
IR region, yielding maximum IR reflectance of 88% for bulk films.
Interestingly, three anomalies were found in ultrathin Ti3C2Tx films: strong
dispersion in the permittivity, interlayer space-dependent optical properties,
and abnormally high IR absorption for a 15-nm-thick film. These anomalies are
important guidelines in the design of Ti3C2Tx-based low-emissivity transparent
films and other related devices, and may inspire other intriguing applications
such as ultrathin IR absorption coatings and tunable IR optical devices.

<h3>Unrevealing hardening and strengthening mechanisms in high-entropy  ceramics from lattice distortion</h3>

<br>
<i>Yiwen Liu, Haifeng Tang, Mengdong Ma, Hulei Yu, Zhongyu Tang, Yanhui Chu</i>
<p>Revealing the hardening and strengthening mechanisms is crucial for
facilitating the design of superhard and high-strength high-entropy ceramics
(HECs). Here, we take high-entropy diborides (HEB$_2$) as the prototype to
thoroughly investigate the hardening and strengthening mechanisms of HECs.
Specifically, the equiatomic 4- to 9-cation single-phase HEB$_2$ ceramics
(4-9HEB$_2$) are fabricated by an ultra-fast high-temperature sintering method.
The as-fabricated 4-9HEB$_2$ samples possess similar grain sizes, comparable
relative densities (up to ~98%), uniform compositions, and clean grain
boundaries without any impurities. The experimental results show that the
hardness and flexural strength of the as-fabricated 4-9HEB$_2$ samples have an
increasing tendency with the increase of metal components. The first-principles
calculations find that lattice distortion is essential to the hardness and
strength of HEB$_2$. With the increase of metal components, an aggravation of
lattice distortion accompanied by B-B bond strengthening is determined,
resulting in the enhancement of the hardness and flexural strength. Moreover,
the correlation between other potential indicators and the hardness/flexural
strength of HEB$_2$ has been disproved, including valence electron
concentration, electronegativity mismatch, and metallic states. Our results
unravel the hardening and strengthening mechanisms of HECs by intensifying
lattice distortion, which may provide guidance for developing superhard and
high-strength HECs.

<p>Atom optics demonstrates optical phenomena with coherent matter waves,
providing a foundational connection between light and matter. Significant
advances in optics have followed the realisation of structured light fields
hosting complex singularities and topologically non-trivial characteristics.
However, analogous studies are still in their infancy in the field of atom
optics. Here, we investigate and experimentally create knotted quantum
wavefunctions in spinor Bose--Einstein condensates which display non-trivial
topologies. In our work we construct coordinated orbital and spin rotations of
the atomic wavefunction, engineering a variety of discrete symmetries in the
combined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The structured wavefunctions that
we create map to the surface of a torus to form torus knots, M\"obius strips,
and a twice-linked Solomon's knot. In this paper we demonstrate striking
connections between the symmetries and underlying topologies of multicomponent
atomic systems and of vector optical fields--a realization of topological
atom-optics.

<i>Motoaki Hirayama, Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita</i>
<p>The chiral Majorana fermion is an exotic particle that is its own
antiparticle. It can arise in a one-dimensional edge of topological materials,
and especially that in a topological superconductor can be exploited in
non-Abelian quantum computation. While the chiral Majorana mode (CMM) remains
elusive, a promising situation is realized when superconductivity coexists with
a topologically non-trivial surface state. Here, we perform fully non-empirical
calculation for the CMM considering superconductivity and surface relaxation,
and show that hexagonal close-packed thallium (Tl) has an ideal electronic
state that harbors the CMM. The $k_z=0$ plane of Tl is a mirror plane,
realizing a full-gap band inversion corresponding to a topological crystalline
insulating phase. Its surface and hinge are stable and easy to make various
structures. Another notable feature is that the surface Dirac point is very
close to the Fermi level, so that a small Zeeman field can induce a topological
transition. Our calculation indicates that Tl will provide a new platform of
the Majorana fermion.

<br>
<i>Linda Albanese, Andrea Alessandrelli, Alessia Annibale, Adriano Barra</i>
<p>Statistical mechanics of spin glasses is one of the main strands toward a
comprehension of information processing by neural networks and learning
machines. Tackling this approach, at the fairly standard replica symmetric
level of description, recently Hebbian attractor networks with multi-node
interactions (often called Dense Associative Memories) have been shown to
outperform their classical pairwise counterparts in a number of tasks, from
their robustness against adversarial attacks and their capability to work with
prohibitively weak signals to their supra-linear storage capacities. Focusing
on mathematical techniques more than computational aspects, in this paper we
relax the replica symmetric assumption and we derive the one-step
broken-replica-symmetry picture of supervised and unsupervised learning
protocols for these Dense Associative Memories: a phase diagram in the space of
the control parameters is achieved, independently, both via the Parisi's
hierarchy within then replica trick as well as via the Guerra's telescope
within the broken-replica interpolation. Further, an explicit analytical
investigation is provided to deepen both the big-data and ground state limits
of these networks as well as a proof that replica symmetry breaking does not
alter the thresholds for learning and slightly increases the maximal storage
capacity. Finally the De Almeida and Thouless line, depicting the onset of
instability of a replica symmetric description, is also analytically derived
highlighting how, crossed this boundary, the broken replica description should
be preferred.

<p>This chapter reviews the state of the art in mutually synchronized
spin-torque and spin Hall nano-oscillator (STNO and SHNO) arrays. After briefly
introducing the underlying physics, we discuss different nano-oscillator
implementations and their functional properties with respect to frequency
range, output power, phase noise, and modulation rates. We then introduce the
concepts and the theory of mutual synchronization and discuss the possible
coupling mechanisms in spintronic nano-oscillators, such as dipolar,
electrical, and spin-wave coupling. We review the experimental literature on
mutually synchronized STNOs and SHNOs in one- and two-dimensional arrays and
discuss ways to increase the number of mutually synchronized nano-oscillators.
Finally, the potential for applications ranging from microwave signal
sources/detectors and ultrafast spectrum analyzers to neuromorphic computing
elements and Ising machines is discussed together with the specific electronic
circuitry that has been designed so far to harness this potential.

<h3>Two-particle correlation effects on nonlinear optical responses in the  1d interacting Rice-Mele model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09668" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09668</a>
<br>
<i>Akira Kofuji, Robert Peters</i>
<p>Nonlinear responses in crystalline solids are attracting a great deal of
attention because of exciting phenomena, such as the bulk photovoltaic effect
in noncentrosymmetric crystals and the third harmonic generation related to
Higgs modes in superconductors, and their potential applicability to electronic
devices. Recently, nonlinear responses have also been studied in strongly
correlated electron systems. Experimental evidence has revealed that
correlations play a significant role in nonlinear responses. However, most
theoretical calculations only consider excitonic effects or involve numerically
demanding approaches, making interpreting the results challenging. In this
paper, we adopt another approach, which is based on real-time evolution using
the correlation expansion method. Particularly, we focus on the 1d interacting
Rice-Mele model. We analyze the impact of the density-density interaction on
the linear and nonlinear conductivities and demonstrate that two-particle
correlations beyond the mean-field level enhance second-order nonlinear
responses, especially the second harmonic generation, while the linear response
is not strongly affected. Furthermore, by decomposing the current into a
one-particle contribution and six two-particle contributions, we show that the
``biexciton transition" term and its nonlinear oscillations is the most
dominant two-particle contribution to the nonlinear response. In addition, we
also show that the intercell charge-charge correlation is strongly enhanced
when the system is driven with the frequency corresponding to the excitonic
peak and can even exceed the intracell correlation. This implies the
possibility of manipulating two-particle correlations with external fields.

<i>Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer</i>
<p>Antiferromagnets (AFMs) attract much research interest because of their
potential for spintronic applications and open fundamental physics questions.
Especially non-collinear AFMs (nAFMs) remain relatively unexplored. Here we
formulate the injection, transport, thermal and coherent pumping of spins in
nAFMs|normal metal bilayers, reporting that the spin current polarization is a
vector with components along both the N\'{e}el vector and net magnetic moment.
The interface spin conductance that governs spin injection and pumping is a
tensor and depends strongly on the local spin configuration. We explain
non-local spin transport experiments in hematite, attribute the controversial
sign problem of the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect to interface effects,
and suggest that interface engineering may enhance the spin pumping efficiency.

<p>The Nd0.6Sr0.4MnO3 manganite system exhibits a phase transition from
paramagnetic insulating (PMI) to ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) state around its
Curie temperature TC = 270 K (bulk). The morphology-driven changes in the
kinetically arrested magnetic phases in NSMO thin films with granular and a
crossed-nano-rod-type morphology are studied. At low temperatures, the
manganite thin films possess a magnetic glassy state arising from the
coexistence of the high-temperature PMI phase and the low-temperature FMM
phase. The extent of kinetic arrest and its relaxation was studied using the
"cooling and heating in unequal field (CHUF)" protocol in magnetic and
magneto-transport investigations. The sample with rod morphology showed a large
extent of phase coexistence compared to the granular sample. Further, with a
field-cooling protocol, time-evolution studies were carried out to understand
the relaxation of arrested magnetic phases across these morphologically
distinct thin films. The results on the devitrification of the arrested
magnetic state are interpreted from the point of view of homogeneous and
heterogeneous nucleation of the FM phase in the PM matrix with respect to
temperature.

<p>Electrons in quantum matter behave like a fluid when the quantum-mechanical
carrier-carrier scattering dominates over other relaxation mechanisms. By
combining a microscopic treatment of electron-electron interactions within the
random phase approximation with a phenomenological Navier-Stokes like equation,
we predict that in the limit of high temperature and strong Coulomb
interactions, both monolayer and bilayer graphene exhibit a universal behavior
in dynamic viscosity. We find that the dynamic viscosity to entropy density
ratio for bilayer graphene is closer to the holographic bound suggesting that
such a bound might be observable in a condensed matter system. We discuss how
this could be observed experimentally using a magnetoconductance measurements
in a Corbino geometry for a realistic range of temperature and carrier density.

<br>
<i>M.E. Bal, E. Cheah, Z. Lei, R. Schott, C. A. Lehner, H. Engelkamp, W. Wegscheider, U. Zeitler</i>
<p>We have characterized the electronic properties of a high-mobility
two-dimensional electron system in modulation doped InAsSb quantum wells and
compare them to InSb quantum wells grown in a similar fashion. Using
temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas experiments as well as FIR transmission
we find an effective mass of $m^{\ast} \approx$ 0.022$m_{e}$, which is lower
than in the investigated InSb quantum well, but due to a rather strong
confinement still higher than in the corresponding bulk compound. The effective
$g$-factor was determined to be $g^{\ast} \approx$ 21.9. These results are also
corroborated by $k \cdot p$ band structure calculations. When spin polarizing
the electrons in a tilted magnetic field, the $g$-factor is significantly
enhanced by electron-electron interactions, reaching a value as large as
$g^{\ast}$ = 60 at a spin polarization P = 0.75. Finally, we show that due to
the low effective mass the quantum Hall effect in our particular sample can be
observed up to a temperature of 60 K and we propose scenarios how to increase
this temperature even further.

<h3>Pressure-tuned quantum criticality in the locally non-centrosymmetric  superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$</h3>

<p>The unconventional superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ (critical temperature
$T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx0.4\,\mathrm{K}$) displays an exceptionally rare
magnetic-field-induced transition between two distinct superconducting (SC)
phases, proposed to be states of even and odd parity of the SC order parameter,
enabled by a locally non-centrosymmetric structure. The SC state exhibits
signatures of antiferromagnetism and is preceded by a phase transition of
unknown origin at $T_{0}\approx0.5\,\mathrm{K}$. Electronic low-temperature
properties of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ show pronounced non-Fermi-liquid behavior,
indicative of a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP). The role of
quantum fluctuations and normal state orders for the superconductivity in a
system with staggered Rashba interaction is currently an open question,
pertinent to explaining the occurrence of two-phase superconductivity. In this
work, using measurements of resistivity and specific heat under hydrostatic
pressure, we show that the $T_{0}$ order vanishes completely at a modest
pressure of $P_{0}=0.5-0.7\,\mathrm{GPa}$, revealing a QCP. The linear
temperature dependence of the resistivity at $P_{0}$ evolves into a
Fermi-liquid quadratic dependence as the quantum criticality is suppressed by
increasing pressure. The dome-like behavior of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ around $P_{0}$
suggests that the fluctuations of the $T_{0}$ order are involved in the SC
pairing mechanism. These results set the scene for further investigations into
the fate of the multi-phase superconductivity across this phase diagram.

<h3>Exposing the odd-parity superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ with  hydrostatic pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09729" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09729</a>
<br>
<i>Meike Pfeiffer, Konstantin Semeniuk, Javier F. Landaeta, Michael Nicklas, Christoph Geibel, Manuel Brando, Seunghyun Khim, Elena Hassinger</i>
<p>Odd-parity superconductivity is a rare and sought-for state of matter with a
potential for applications in topological quantum computing. Crystals with
staggered locally non-centrosymmetric structures have been proposed as
platforms where a magnetic field can induce a transition between even- and
odd-parity superconducting (SC) states. The superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ with
a critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx0.4\,\mathrm{K}$ is likely the
first example material showing such a phase transition at a magnetic field
$\mu_{0}H^{*}=4\,\mathrm{T}$ applied along the crystallographic $c$ axis.
CeRh$_2$As$_2$ also undergoes a phase transition of an unknown origin at
$T_{0}=0.5\,\mathrm{K}$ and presents signs of an antiferromagnetism below
$0.25\,\mathrm{K}$. Under a hydrostatic pressure of
$P_0\approx0.5\,\mathrm{GPa}$, the $T_{0}$ order vanishes, resulting in a
quantum critical point. Here, using resistivity measurements under pressure, we
investigate how the correlations and normal-state orders affect the SC phase
switching. We find an enhancement of the in-plane critical field near $P_0$. At
the same time, the two SC states persist well past $P_{0}$, until at least
$2.7\,\mathrm{GPa}$ and $H^{*}$ is reduced to $0.3\,\mathrm{T}$, making the
putative odd-parity state stable almost down to zero field.

<h3>Dynamics and condensation of polaritons in an optical nanocavity coupled  to two-dimensional materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09742" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09742</a>
<br>
<i>Maria Vittoria Gurrieri, Emil V. Denning, Kristian Seegert, Philip T. Kristensen, Jesper Mørk</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive investigation of the light-matter interaction
dynamics in two-dimensional materials coupled with a spectrally isolated cavity
mode in the strong coupling regime. The interaction between light and matter
breaks the translational symmetry of excitons in the two-dimensional lattice
and results in the emergence of a localized polariton state. Employing a novel
approach involving transformation to exciton reaction coordinates, we derive a
Markovian master equation to describe the formation of a macroscopic population
in the localized polariton state. Our study shows that the construction of a
large-scale polariton population is affected by correction terms addressing the
breakdown of translational symmetry. Increasing the spatial width of the cavity
mode increases the Coulomb scattering rates while the correction terms saturate
and affect the system's dynamics progressively less. Tuning the lattice
temperature can induce bistability and hysteresis with different origins than
those recognized for quantum wells in larger microcavities. We identify a limit
temperature $T_{\mathrm{l}}$ as a key factor for stimulated emissions and
forming a macroscopic population, enriching our understanding of strong
coupling dynamics in systems with extreme confinement.

<h3>Tunable 2D Electron- and 2D Hole States Observed at Fe/SrTiO$_3$  Interfaces</h3>

<p>Oxide electronics provide the key concepts and materials for enhancing
silicon-based semiconductor technologies with novel functionalities. However, a
basic but key property of semiconductor devices still needs to be unveiled in
its oxidic counterparts: the ability to set or even switch between two types of
carriers - either negatively (n) charged electrons or positively (p) charged
holes. Here, we provide direct evidence for individually emerging n- or p-type
2D band dispersions in STO-based heterostructures using resonant photoelectron
spectroscopy. The key to tuning the carrier character is the oxidation state of
an adjacent Fe-based interface layer: For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the
empty band gap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti and Fe-derived states
across the interface, while for Fe$_3$O$_4$ overlayers, an 2D electron system
is formed. Unexpected oxygen vacancy characteristics arise for the hole-type
interfaces, which as of yet had been exclusively assigned to the emergence of
2DESs. In general, this finding opens up the possibility to straightforwardly
switch the type of conductivity at STO interfaces by the oxidation state of a
redox overlayer. This will extend the spectrum of phenomena in oxide
electronics, including the realization of combined n/p-type all-oxide
transistors or logic gates.

<h3>Dynamic control of the Bose-Einstein-like condensation transition in  scalar active matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09823" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09823</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas Berx</i>
<p>The dynamics of a generic class of scalar active matter exhibiting a
diffusivity edge is studied in a confining potential where the amplitude is
governed by a time-dependent protocol. For such non-equilibrium systems, the
diffusion coefficient vanishes when the single-particle density field reaches a
critical threshold, inducing a condensation transition that is formally akin to
Bose-Einstein condensation. We show that this transition arises even for
systems that do not reach a steady state, leading to condensation in finite
time. Since the transition can be induced for a fixed effective temperature by
evolving the system, we effectively show that the temporal coordinate
constitutes an alternative control parameter to tune the transition
characteristics. For a constant-amplitude protocol, our generalised
thermodynamics reduces in the steady-state limit to earlier results. Lastly, we
show numerically that for periodic modulation of the potential amplitude, the
condensation transition is reentrant.

<p>Bloch points in magnetic materials are attractive entities in view of
magnetic information transport. Here, Bloch point configuration has been
investigated and experimentally determined in a magnetic trilayer
($Gd_{12}Co_{88}/Nd_{17}Co_{83}/Gd_{24}Co_{76}$) with carefully adjusted
composition within the ferrimagnetic $Gd_{x}Co_{1-x}$ alloys in order to
engineer saturation magnetization, exchange length, and interlayer couplings
(ferromagnetic vs antiferromagnetic). X-ray vector magnetic tomography has
allowed us to determine experimentally Bloch point polarity (related to
topological charge) and Bloch point helicity ${\gamma}$ (determined by
magnetostatic energy). At the bottom layer (close to the ferromagnetic
interface), Bloch points adopt a standard circulating configuration with
helicity ${\gamma}$ close to ${\pi}/2$. Within the top layer (with much lower
saturation magnetization), Bloch points nucleate within a Neel-like exchange
spring domain wall created by the antiferromagnetic coupling and adopt an
uncommon hyperbolic configuration, characterized by much larger helicity
angles. Our results indicate a path for Bloch point engineering in future
applications adjusting material parameters and domain wall characteristics.

<h3>Probing the Mott-insulating behavior of Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ with DFT+DMFT</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09839" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09839</a>
<br>
<i>Maximilian E. Merkel, Aria Mansouri Tehrani, Claude Ederer</i>
<p>We investigate the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations,
and lattice distortions in the $5d^1$ double perovskite Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$.
Combining density-functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT), we establish the Mott-insulating character of Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ in both
its cubic and tetragonal paramagnetic phases. Despite substantial spin-orbit
coupling, its impact on the formation of the insulating state is minimal,
consistent with theoretical expectations for $d^1$ systems. We further
characterize the electronic properties of the cubic and tetragonal phases by
analyzing spectral functions and local occupations in terms of multipole
moments centered on the Re sites. Our results confirm the presence of
ferroically ordered $z^2$ quadrupoles in addition to the antiferroic
$x^2-y^2$-type order. We compare two equivalent but complementary descriptions
in terms of either effective Re-\ttg frontier orbitals or more localized
atomic-like Re-d and O-p orbitals. The former maps directly on a physically
intuitive picture in terms of nominal $d^1$ Re cations, while the latter
explicitly demonstrates the role of hybridization with the ligands in the
spin-orbit splitting and the formation of the charge quadrupoles around the Re
sites. Finally, we compare our DFT+DMFT results with a previous DFT+$U$ study
of the tetragonal paramagnetic state. We find good qualitative agreement for
the dominant charge quadrupoles, but also notable differences in the
corresponding spectral functions, underscoring the need for more comparative
studies between these two methods.

<h3>Geometry of the dephasing sweet spots of spin-orbit qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09840" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09840</a>
<br>
<i>Lorenzo Mauro, Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Marion Bassi, Vivien Schmitt, Yann-Michel Niquet</i>
<p>The dephasing time of spin-orbit qubits is limited by the coupling with
electrical and charge noise. However, there may exist "dephasing sweet spots"
where the qubit decouples (to first order) from the noise so that the dephasing
time reaches a maximum. Here we discuss the nature of the dephasing sweet spots
of a spin-orbit qubit electrically coupled to some fluctuator. We characterize
the Zeeman energy $E_\mathrm{Z}$ of this qubit by the tensor $G$ such that
$E_\mathrm{Z}=\mu_B\sqrt{\mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T}G\mathbf{B}}$ (with $\mu_B$ the
Bohr magneton and $\mathbf{B}$ the magnetic field), and its response to the
fluctuator by the derivative $G^\prime$ of $G$ with respect to the fluctuating
field. The geometrical nature of the sweet spots on the unit sphere describing
the magnetic field orientation depends on the sign of the eigenvalues of
$G^\prime$. We show that sweet spots usually draw lines on this sphere. We then
discuss how to characterize the electrical susceptibility of a spin-orbit qubit
with test modulations on the gates. We apply these considerations to a Ge/GeSi
spin qubit heterostructure, and discuss the prospects for the engineering of
sweet spots.

<h3>Dynamic Hysteresis Across a Dissipative Multi-Mode Phase Transition</h3>

<br>
<i>Marvin Röhrle, Jens Benary, Erik Bernhart, Herwig Ott</i>
<p>Dissipative phase transitions are characteristic features in open quantum
systems. Key signatures are the dynamical switching between different states in
the vicinity of the phase transition and the appearance of hysteresis. Here, we
experimentally study dynamic sweeps across a first order dissipative phase
transition in a multi-mode driven-dissipative system. In contrast to previous
studies, we perform sweeps of the dissipation strength instead of the driving
strength. We extract exponents for the scaling of the hysteresis area in
dependence of the sweep time and study the $g^{(2)}(0)$ correlations, which
show non-trivial behavior. Due to the multi-mode nature of the system, we can
also study the influence of the temperature on the hysteresis area. We compare
our results to numerical calculations done for a single mode variant of the
system, and find surprisingly good agreement. Furthermore, we identify and
discuss the differences between a scan of the dissipation strength and a scan
of the driving strength.

<p>Magnets are interesting materials for classical and quantum information
technologies. However, the short decoherence and dephasing times that determine
the scale and speed of information networks, severely limit the appeal of
employing the ferromagnetic resonance. Here we show that the lifetime and
coherence of the uniform Kittel mode can be enhanced by 3-magnon
interaction-induced mixing with the long-lived magnons at the minima of the
dispersion relation. Analytical and numerical calculations based on this model
explain recent experimental results and predict experimental signatures of
quantum coherence.

<p>The microscopic origin of the topological magnon band gap in CrI$_3$
ferromagnets has been a subject of controversy for years since two main models
with distinct characteristics, i.e., Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and Kitaev,
provided possible explanations with different outcome implications. Here we
investigate the angular magnetic field dependence of the magnon gap of CrI$_3$
by elucidating what main contributions play a major role in its generation. We
implement stochastic atomistic spin dynamics simulations to compare the impact
of these two spin interactions on the magnon spectra. We observe three distinct
magnetic field dependencies between these two gap opening mechanisms. First, we
demonstrate that the Kitaev-induced magnon gap is influenced by both the
direction and amplitude of the applied magnetic field, while the DM-induced gap
is solely affected by the magnetic field direction. Second, the position of the
Dirac cones within the Kitaev-induced magnon gap shifts in response to changes
in the magnetic field direction, whereas they remain unaffected by the magnetic
field direction in the DM-induced gap scenario. Third, we find a
direct-indirect magnon band-gap transition in the Kitaev model by varying the
applied magnetic field direction. These differences may distinguish the origin
of topological magnon gaps in CrI$_3$ and other van der Waals magnetic layers.
Our findings pave the way for exploration and engineering topological gaps in
van der Waals materials.

<p>With the rise of two-dimensional (2D) materials, unique properties that are
completely distinct from bulk counterparts continue to emerge at
low-dimensional scales, presenting numerous opportunities and challenges. It
also provides a new perspective for the study of transition metal system. Here,
based on density functional theory (DFT), the physical properties of 2D
monolayer LiV2S4 have been studied. Remarkable changes have been observed,
i.e., vanadium dimerization, ferromagnetism, charge distribution and
metal-insulator transition (MIT). It is argued that the electronic instability
leads to the V dimerization which further lifts the degeneracy of charge
distribution and stabilizes the charge and spin ordering state.

<h3>Human Perception-Inspired Grain Segmentation Refinement Using  Conditional Random Fields</h3>

<br>
<i>Doruk Aksoy, Huolin L. Xin, Timothy J. Rupert, William J. Bowman</i>
<p>Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as grain
boundaries in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant
challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision
algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle
with thin masks, often necessitating intricate post-processing for effective
contour closure and continuity. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a
fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique, leveraging domain knowledge
about grain boundary connectivity and employing conditional random fields and
perceptual grouping rules. This approach significantly enhances segmentation
mask accuracy, achieving a 79% segment identification accuracy in validation
with a U-Net model on electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide.
Additionally, a novel grain alignment metric is introduced, showing a 51%
improvement in grain alignment, providing a more detailed assessment of
segmentation performance for complex microstructures. This method not only
enables rapid and accurate segmentation but also facilitates an unprecedented
level of data analysis, significantly improving the statistical representation
of grain boundary networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where
precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.

<h3>Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of titanium nitride for  superconducting devices</h3>

<br>
<i>John Femi-Oyetoro, Sasha Sypkens, Henry LeDuc, Matthew Dickie, Andrew Beyer, Peter Day, Frank Greer</i>
<p>This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the exceptional
superconducting attributes of titanium nitride (TiN) achieved through
plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) on both planar and intricate
three-dimensional (3D) structures. We introduced an additional substrate
biasing cycle to densify the film and remove ligand residues, augmenting the
properties while minimizing impurities. While reactive-sputtered TiN films
exhibit high quality, our technique ensures superior uniformity by consistently
maintaining a desired sheet resistance greater than 95 percent across a 6inch
wafer, a critical aspect for fabricating extensive arrays of superconducting
devices and optimizing wafer yield. Moreover, our films demonstrate exceptional
similarity to conventional reactive-sputtered films, consistently reaching a
critical temperature (Tc) of 4.35 K with a thickness of around 40 nm. This
marks a notable achievement compared to previously reported ALD-based
superconducting TiN. Using the same process as for planar films, we obtained Tc
for aspect ratios (ARs) ranging from 2 to 40, observing a Tc of approximately 2
K for ARs between 2 and 10.5. We elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the
limitations and degradation of superconducting properties over these aggressive
3D structures. Our results seamlessly align with both current and
next-generation superconducting technologies, meeting stringent criteria for
thin-film constraints, large-scale deposition, conformality, 3D integration
schemes, and yield optimization.

<h3>Disorder-induced decoupling of attracting identical fermions: transfer  matrix approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09987" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09987</a>
<br>
<i>Lolita I. Knyazeva, Vladimir I. Yudson</i>
<p>We consider a pair of identical fermions with a short-range attractive
interaction on a finite lattice cluster in the presence of a strong site
disorder. This toy model imitates a low density regime of the strongly
disordered Hubbard model. In contrast to spinful fermions, which can
simultaneously occupy a site with a minimal energy and thus always form a bound
state resistant to disorder, for the identical fermions the probability of
pairing on neighboring sites depends on the relation between the interaction
and the disorder. The complexity of 'brute-force' calculations (both analytical
and numerical) of this probability grows rapidly with the number of sites even
for the simplest cluster geometry in the form of a closed chain. Remarkably,
this problem is related to an old mathematical task of computing the volume of
a polyhedron, known as NP-hard. However, we have found that the problem in the
chain geometry can be exactly solved by the transfer matrix method. Using this
approach we have calculated the pairing probability in the long chain for an
arbitrary relation between the interaction and the disorder strengths and
completely described the crossover between the regimes of coupled and separated
fermions.

<h3>Entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals and spin structures in  interacting chains in and out of equilibrium</h3>

<i>Vanja Marić, Saverio Bocini, Maurizio Fagotti</i>
<p>We take the paradigm of interacting spin chains, the Heisenberg
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ model, as a reference system and consider interacting
models that are related to it by Jordan-Wigner transformations and restrictions
to sub-chains. An example is the fermionic analogue of the gapless XXZ
Hamiltonian, which, in a continuum scaling limit, is described by the massless
Thirring model. We work out the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropies of disjoint blocks
in the ground state and extract the universal scaling functions describing the
R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information in the limit of infinite lengths. We
consider also the von Neumann entropy, but only in the limit of large distance.
We show how to use the entropies of spin blocks to unveil the spin structures
of the underlying massless Thirring model. Finally, we speculate about the
tripartite information after global quenches and conjecture its asymptotic
behaviour in the limit of infinite time and small quench. The resulting
conjecture for the ``residual tripartite information'', which corresponds to
the limit in which the intervals' lengths are infinitely larger than their
(large) distance, supports the claim of universality recently made studying
noninteracting spin chains. Our mild assumptions imply that the residual
tripartite information after a small quench of the anisotropy in the gapless
phase of XXZ is equal to $-\log 2$.
