<h3>Feedback enhanced Dyakonov-Shur instability in Graphene-FET</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08900</a>

Graphene devices are known to have the potential to operate THz signals. In
particular, graphene field-effect transistors have been proposed as devices to
host plasmonic instabilities in the THz realm; for instance, Dyakonov-Shur
instability which relies upon dc excitation. In this work, starting from a
hydrodynamical description of the charge carriers, we extend the transmission
line description of graphene field-effect transistors to a scheme with a
positive feedback loop, also considering the effects of delay, which leads to
the transcendental transfer function with terms of the form $e^{as}{\rm
sech}^k(s)/s$. Applying the conditions for the excitation of Dyakonov-Shur
instability, we report an enhanced voltage gain in the linear regime that is
corroborated by our simulations of the nonlinear hydrodynamic model for the
charge carriers. This translates to both greater saturation amplitude -- often
up to 50% increase -- and fastest growth rate of the self-oscillations. Thus,
we bring forth a prospective concept for the realization of a THz oscillator
suitable for future plasmonic circuitry.

<h3>PT breaking and RG flows between multicritical Yang-Lee fixed points</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08522" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08522</a>
<br>
<i>Máté Lencsés, Alessio Miscioscia, Giuseppe Mussardo, Gábor Takács</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a novel class of Renormalization Group flows which connect
multicritical versions of the two-dimensional Yang-Lee edge singularity
described by the conformal minimal models M(2,2n+3). The absence in these
models of an order parameter implies that the flows towards and between
Lee-Yang edge singularities are all related to the spontaneous breaking of PT
symmetry and comprise a pattern of flows in the space of PT symmetric theories
consistent with the c-theorem and the counting of relevant directions.
Additionally, we find that while in a part of the phase diagram the domains of
unbroken and broken PT symmetry are separated by critical manifolds of class
M(2,2n+3), other parts of the boundary between the two domains are not
critical.

<h3>Thermalization at Low Temperatures via Slowly-Driven Multi-Site Baths</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08525</a>
<br>
<i>Cristian Zanoci, Yongchan Yoo, Brian Swingle</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the thermalization properties of one-dimensional open quantum
systems coupled to baths at their boundary. The baths are driven to their
thermal states via Lindblad operators, while the system undergoes Hamiltonian
dynamics. We specifically consider multi-site baths and investigate the extent
to which the late-time steady state resembles a Gibbs state at some
controllable temperature set by the baths. We study three models: a
non-interacting fermion model accessible via free-fermion technology, and two
interacting models, the XZ model and the chiral clock model, which are
accessible via tensor network methods. We show that, by tuning towards the weak
coupling and slow driving limits, one can engineer low temperatures in the bulk
of the system provided the bath size is big enough. We use this capability to
study energy transport in the XZ model at lower temperatures than previously
reported. Our work paves the way for future studies of interacting open quantum
systems at low temperatures.

<h3>Kondo Temperature Evaluated from Linear Conductance in Magnetic Fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08544</a>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically and experimentally study the universal scaling property of
the spin-1/2 Kondo state in the magnetic field dependence of bias-voltage
linear conductance through a quantum dot at low temperatures. We discuss an
efficient and reliable procedure to evaluate the Kondo temperature defined at
the ground state from experimental or numerical data sets of the magnetic field
dependence of the linear conductance or the magnetization of the quantum dot.
This procedure is helpful for quantitative comparison of the theory and the
experiment, and useful in Kondo-correlated systems where temperature control
over a wide range is difficult, such as for cold atoms. We demonstrate its
application to experimentally measured electric current through a carbon
nanotube quantum dot.

<h3>Strong-randomness renormalization groups</h3>

<br>
<br>
This is a very brief review article, written for a book (in preparation) in
memory of Michael E. Fisher and to celebrate 50+ years since the Wilson-Fisher
renormalization group. Strong-randomness renormalization groups were first
developed to treat various quantum critical ground states, especially in
one-dimensional systems. After briefly reviewing some of the earlier work with
these methods, the recent application of this approach to the many-body
localization (MBL) phase transition is reviewed.

<h3>Moment canting and domain effects in antiferromagnetic DyRh$_2$Si$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08607" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08607</a>
<br>
<i>Kristin Kliemt, Michelle Ocker, Sarah Krebber, Susanne Schulz, Denis V. Vyalikh, Cornelius Krellner, Dmitry Yu. Usachov</i>
<br>
<br>
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the layered
antiferromagnetic compound DyRh$_2$Si$_2$ in the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure
is presented. The heat capacity shows two transitions upon cooling, the first
one at the N{\'e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}=55\,\rm K$ and a second one at
$T_{\rm N2}=12\,\rm K$. Using magnetization measurements, we study the canting
process of the Dy moments upon changing the temperature and can assign $T_{\rm
N2}$ to the onset of the canting of the magnetic moments towards the $[100]$
direction away from the $c$ axis. Furthermore, we found that the field
dependence of the magnetization is highly anisotropic and shows a two-step
process for $H\parallel 001$. We used a mean-field model to determine the
crystalline electric field as well as the exchange interaction parameters. Our
magnetization data together with the calculations reveal a moment orientation
close to the $[101]$ direction in the tetragonal structure at low temperatures
and fields. Applying photoemission electron microscopy, we explore the (001)
surface of the cleaved DyRh$_2$Si$_2$ single crystal and visualize Si- and
Dy-terminated surfaces. Our results indicate that the Si-Rh-Si surface protects
the deeper lying magnetically active Dy layers and is thus attractive for
investigation of magnetic domains and their properties in the large family of
LnT$_2$Si$_2$ materials.

<h3>Exploring exotic configurations with anomalous features with deep  learning: Application of classical and quantum-classical hybrid anomaly  detection</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08616" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08616</a>
<br>
<i>Kumar J. B. Ghosh, Sumit Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we present the application of classical and quantum-classical
hybrid anomaly detection schemes to explore exotic configuration with anomalous
features. We consider the Anderson model as a prototype where we define two
types of anomalies - a high conductance in presence of strong impurity and low
conductance in presence of weak impurity - as a function of random impurity
distribution. Such anomalous outcome constitutes less than 10% of a data set
and is not a part of the training process. The anomaly detection is therefore
more suitable to detect unknown features which is not possible with
conventional classification or regression methods. We also present a systematic
study of the performance of the classical and the hybrid method and show that
the inclusion of a quantum circuit significantly enhances the performance of
anomaly detection which we quantify with suitable performance metrics. Our
approach is quite generic in nature and can be used for any system that relies
on a large number of parameters to find their new configurations which can hold
exotic new features.

<h3>Interaction between pentacene molecules and monolayer transition metal  dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08619" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08619</a>
<br>
<i>E. Black, P. Kratzer, J. M. Morbec</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory, we
investigated the adsorption of pentacene molecules on monolayer two-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We considered the four most popular
TMDs, namely, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$, and we examined the
structural and electronic properties of pentacene/TMD systems. We discuss how
monolayer pentacene interacts with the TMDs, and how this interaction affects
the charge transfer and work function of the heterostructure. We also analyse
the type of band alignment formed in the heterostructure and how it is affected
by molecule-molecule and molecule-substrate interactions. Such analysis is
valuable since pentacene/TMD heterostructures are considered to be promising
for application in flexible, thin and lightweight photovoltaics and
photodetectors.

<h3>Neutron Spectroscopy and Computational Methods in investigation of Na  ion Battery Materials: A Perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08621" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08621</a>
<br>
<i>Rastislav Turányi, Sanghamitra Mukhopadhyay</i>
<br>
<br>
Adoption of renewable energy is essential to address the challenge of climate
change, but that necessitates energy storage technologies. Lithium-ion
batteries, the most ubiquitous solution, are insufficient for large-scale
applications, so sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), an alternative, are of great
current interest. To design and synthesise a commercially viable SIB with
required performance, a fundamental understanding of the materials is
imperative. Neutron diffraction and spectroscopy provide a unique insight of
atomistic understanding of structure and dynamics in materials, therefore in
this perspective we have explored how these techniques have been used in SIB
research. As neutrons have high penetrability in materials and neutron-matter
interaction probabilities are independent of the atomic number, they can
provide unique information about motion of particles in bulk materials in the
pico- to nanosecond time scales. This makes neutron scattering techniques
important tools in battery research. Sodium has a low neutron cross section,
which makes computational simulations essential for analysing neutron
scattering data of SIB materials. With the availability of high flux neutron
sources, high resolution instruments and high performance computers and
simulations tools, neutron spectroscopy has been an emerging technique in the
last decade for SIB research. In this perspective, we have shown that neutron
diffraction is the most popular, while neutron spectroscopies, are just
emerging. Computational simulation methods, both force field based and from
first principles, are common but still are mostly used independent of neutron
experiments. We have identified that suitable improvements of instrumentation,
sample environments and simulations methodology will allow these techniques to
be more accessible in future.

<h3>Location and thermal evolution of the pseudogap due to spin fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08623</a>
<br>
<i>Mengxing Ye, Zhentao Wang, Rafael M Fernandes, Andrey V Chubukov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study pseudogap behavior in a metal near a spin density wave (SDW)
instability due to thermal magnetic fluctuations. We consider the $t-t'$
Hubbard model on a square lattice at a finite doping, at intermediate coupling
strength, and analyze the thermal evolution of the electron spectral function
between a SDW ordered state at low temperatures and a normal Fermi liquid at
high temperatures. We argue that for proper description of the pseudogap one
needs to sum up infinite series of diagrams for both the fermionic self-energy
and the SDW order parameter in the SDW state or the magnetic correlation length
in the paramagnetic state. We use eikonal approach to sum up an infinite series
of diagrammatic contributions from thermal fluctuations. Earlier studies found
that in the SDW state, the spectral function $A_{\bf k} (\omega)$ of a hot
fermion at a finite $T$ is exponentially small below the energy scale $\Delta
(T)$, which scales with SDW order and vanishes at the ordering temperature
$T_N$, and has a hump at a larger frequency $\Delta_{\rm pg}$, comparable to
the zero-temperature SDW gap $\Delta (T=0)$. We argue that the hump, which we
associate with the pseudogap, survives in some $T$ range above $T_N$. We show
that this range is split by regions of strong and weak pseudogap behavior. In
the first region, $\Delta_{\rm pg}$ is weakly temperature dependent, despite
that it comes from thermal fluctuations. Such a behavior has been seen in
numerical studies of the Hubbard model. We show that to obtain it, one needs to
go beyond the one-loop approximation and sum up the infinite series of
diagrams. In the second regime, $\Delta_{\rm pg}$ decreases with increasing $T$
and eventually vanishes. We further argue that a magnetic pseudogap at a finite
$T$ emerges only if the ground state is magnetically ordered. We present the
phase diagram and apply the results to high-$T_c$ cuprates.

<h3>Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Superconductors with Coexisting Spin  Density Waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08633</a>
<br>
<i>Sean F Peterson, Sourav Sen Choudhury, Yves Idzerda</i>
<br>
<br>
Thermal conductivity measurements can provide key and experimentally
verifiable insight into the electronic transport of unconventional
superconductors. In this work, electronic thermal transport of two-dimensional
tight-binding metallic systems with coexisting $d$-wave superconducting (SC)
and antiferromagnetic spin density wave (SDW) orders with nesting vector
$\mathbf{Q} = (\pi/2,\pi/2)$ or $(\pi,0)$ are considered. The coexisting SC and
SDW orders are modelled at the mean-field level. Thermal conductivities are
numerically calculated within Boltzmann kinetic theory in the weak impurity
scattering (Born) limit. These SDW nesting vectors are chosen for their unique
property of reconstructing the Fermi surface (FS) parallel to $\mathbf{Q}$ and
preserving the metallic FS perpendicular to $\mathbf{Q}$. This leads to
anisotropic electronic thermal conductivities parallel and perpendicular to
$\mathbf{Q}$, which also depend on the presence or absence of additional
gapless excitations exclusive to the coexistence phase. It was found that the
$\mathbf{Q} = (\pi/2,\pi/2)$ and $(\pi,0)$ SDW systems exhibit equivalent
electron transport relative to $\mathbf{Q}$. These systems also had equivalent
electron transport when coexisting with a $d$-wave SC gap when
$\Delta_{\mathbf{k}}$ had the same symmetry class under translations of
$\mathbf{Q}$.

<h3>Electromagnetic signatures of chiral quantum spin liquid</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Quantum spin liquid (QSL) has become an exciting topic in interacting spin
systems that do not order magnetically down to the lowest experimentally
accessible temperature; however, conclusive experimental evidence remains
lacking. Motivated by the recent surge of theoretical and experimental interest
in a half-filled Hubbard model on the triangular lattice, where chiral QSL can
be stabilized, we investigate the electromagnetic signature of the chiral QSL
to aid experimental detection. We systematically studied the electrical charge
and orbital electrical current associated with a spinon excitation in the
chiral QSL based on parton mean-field theory and unbiased density-matrix
renormalization group calculations. We then calculated both longitudinal and
transverse optical conductivities below the Mott gap. We also conduct quantum
field theory analysis to unravel the connection between spinon excitation and
emergent and physical gauge fields. Our results show that the chiral QSL phase
has a clear electromagnetic response even in a Mott insulator regime, which can
facilitate the experimental detection of this long-sought-after phase.

<h3>Electronic structure of boron and aluminum $δ$-doped layers in  silicon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08636" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08636</a>
<br>
<i>Quinn T. Campbell, Shashank Misra, Andrew D. Baczewski</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent work on atomic-precision dopant incorporation technologies has led to
the creation of both boron and aluminum $\delta$-doped layers in silicon with
densities above the solid solubility limit. We use density functional theory to
predict the band structure and effective mass values of such $\delta$ layers,
first modeling them as ordered supercells. Structural relaxation is found to
have a significant impact on the impurity band energies and effective masses of
the boron layers, but not the aluminum layers. However, disorder in the
$\delta$ layers is found to lead to significant flattening of the bands in both
cases. We calculate the local density of states and doping potential for these
$\delta$-doped layers, demonstrating that their influence is highly localized
with spatial extents at most 4 nm. We conclude that acceptor $\delta$-doped
layers exhibit different electronic structure features dependent on both the
dopant atom and spatial ordering. This suggests prospects for controlling the
electronic properties of these layers if the local details of the incorporation
chemistry can be fine tuned.

<h3>Irreversibility across a nonreciprocal ${\cal PT}$-symmetry-breaking  phase transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08661</a>
<br>
<i>Henry Alston, Luca Cocconi, Thibault Bertrand</i>
<br>
<br>
Nonreciprocal interactions are commonplace in continuum-level descriptions of
both biological and synthetic active matter, yet studies addressing their
implications for time-reversibility have so far been limited to microscopic
models. Here, we derive a general expression for the average rate of
informational entropy production in the most generic mixture of conserved phase
fields with nonreciprocal couplings and additive conservative noise. For the
particular case of a binary system with Cahn-Hilliard dynamics augmented by
nonreciprocal cross-diffusion terms, we observe a non-trivial scaling of the
entropy production rate across a parity-time symmetry breaking phase
transition. We derive a closed-form analytic expression in the weak-noise
regime for the entropy production rate due to the emergence of a macroscopic
dynamic phase, showing it can be written in terms of the global polar order
parameter, a measure of parity-time symmetry breaking.

<h3>Annealing of swift heavy ion tracks in amorphous silicon dioxide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08667" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08667</a>
<br>
<i>Shankar Dutt, Christian Notthoff, Xue Wang, Christina Trautmann, Pablo Mota-Santiago, Patrick Kluth</i>
<br>
<br>
The annealing kinetics of the high energy ion damage in amorphous silicon
dioxide (a-SiO2) are still not well understood, despite the material's
widespread application in material science, physics, geology, and biology. This
study investigates how annealing temperature, duration, and ambient environment
affect the recovery of irradiation damage produced along the trajectory of
swift heavy ions in a-SiO2. The track-annealing kinetics and the changing ion
track morphology were investigated using synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) and etching methods. We found that track annealing proceeds
quicker near the sample surface demonstrated by a changing track etch rate as a
function of depth. Measurements of ion tracks using SAXS show only small
changes in the radial density distribution profile of the ion tracks.
Activation energy of the annealing process at different sample depths was
determined and the effect of the capping layer during the annealing process was
also studied. Combination of oxygen diffusion and stress relaxation may
contribute to the observed behaviour of preferential and anisotropic healing of
the ion track. The results add to the fundamental understanding of ion track
damage recovery and may have direct implications for materials for radioactive
waste storage and solid state nanopores.

<h3>Superconductivity in single crystals of a quasi-one dimensional infinite  chain cuprate Sr$_x$Ca$_{1-x}$CuO$_2$ at 90 K</h3>

<br>
<br>
Although there is no complete theory of high temperature superconductivity,
the importance of CuO$_2$ planes in cuprate superconductors is confirmed from
both theory and experiments. Strong Coulomb repulsion between electrons on the
CuO$_2$ plane makes the resultant electron system highly correlated and a
difficult problem to solve since exact solutions of many-body Hamiltonian in
two dimensions do not exist. If however, superconductivity can arise in
structures having chains rather than planes and having a high critical
temperature, then the high temperature superconductivity problem could become
more tractable since exact solutions in one dimension do exist. In this paper,
we report the observation of bulk superconductivity in single crystals of a
cuprate Sr$_x$Ca$_{1-x}$CuO$_2$ at very high critical temperature, T$_c$, of
$\sim$ 90 K whose structure reveals the presence of infinite double chains of
Cu-O-Cu-O instead of CuO$_2$ planes, thus, ensuring quasi-one dimensional
superconductivity. Bulk superconducting behaviour was observed in \textit{dc}
magnetisation, \textit{ac} susceptibility as well as resistance measurements.
The observation of bulk superconductivity in Sr$_x$Ca$_{1-x}$CuO$_2$ having
chains of Cu-O-Cu-O rather than planes of CuO$_2$ at a high T$_c$ of 90 K is
expected to profoundly impact our understanding of high temperature
superconductivity.

<h3>Bogoliubov excitations driven by thermal lattice phonons in a quantum  fluid of light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08677</a>
<br>
<i>Irénée Frérot, Amit Vashisht, Martina Morassi, Aristide Lemaître, Sylvain Ravets, Jacqueline Bloch, Anna Minguzzi, Maxime Richard</i>
<br>
<br>
Elementary excitations in weakly interacting quantum fluids have a correlated
particle-hole nature that leads to spectacular macroscopic quantum phenomena
such as superfluidity. This many-body character was established in the context
of cold-atom condensates at thermal equilibrium in the framework of
Bogoliubov's celebrated theory of the weakly interacting Bose gas. Bogoliubov
excitations were also found to be highly relevant to driven-dissipative quantum
fluid of light, with certain resulting phenomena strikingly analogue to their
equilibrium counterparts, but also genuine out-of-equilibrium aspects. In this
work, we investigate both theoretically and experimentally a regime in which
the elementary excitations in a quantum fluid of light result dominantly from
their interaction with thermal lattice phonons, namely the elementary
vibrations of the crystal. By an accurate comparison with the theoretically
predicted spectral function of the driven-dissipative quantum fluid we achieve
a quantitative understanding of the particle-hole nature of the elementary
excitations, and unveil a remarkable decoupling from thermal excitations which
is expected to be relevant in equilibrium quantum fluids as well. Finally, we
exploit this quantitative understanding to identify a crossover temperature
around $1\,$K, below which the lattice phonons are sufficiently quieted down
for the quantum fluctuations to take over in the generation of Bogoliubov
excitations. This regime is highly desired as it is characterized by strong
quantum correlations between Bogoliubov excitations.

<h3>Multiple Incommensurate Magnetic States in the Kagome Antiferromagnet  Na2Mn3Cl8</h3>

<br>
<br>
The kagome lattice can host exotic magnetic phases arising from frustrated
and competing magnetic interactions. However, relatively few insulating kagome
materials exhibit incommensurate magnetic ordering. Here, we present a study of
the magnetic structures and interactions of antiferromagnetic
Na$_2$Mn$_3$Cl$_8$ with an undistorted Mn$^{2+}$ kagome network. Using
neutron-diffraction and bulk magnetic measurements, we show that
Na$_2$Mn$_3$Cl$_8$ hosts two different incommensurate magnetic states, which
develop at $T_{N1} = 1.6$ K and $T_{N2} = 0.6$ K. Magnetic Rietveld refinements
indicate magnetic propagation vectors of the form $\mathbf{q} =
(q_{x},q_{y},\frac{3}{2})$, and our neutron-diffraction data can be well
described by cycloidal magnetic structures. By optimizing exchange parameters
against magnetic diffuse-scattering data, we show that the spin Hamiltonian
contains ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third-neighbor
Heisenberg interactions, with a significant contribution from long-ranged
dipolar coupling. This experimentally-determined interaction model is compared
with density-functional-theory simulations. Using classical Monte Carlo
simulations, we show that these competing interactions explain the experimental
observation of multiple incommensurate magnetic phases and may stabilize
multi-$\mathbf{q}$ states. Our results expand the known range of magnetic
behavior on the kagome lattice.

<h3>Phase diagram for the extended Hubbard model on a square lattice</h3>

The Extended Hubbard model describes electron-electron interactions and is
commonly used to understand various phenomena in strongly correlated systems.
In this paper, we focus on investigating the phase diagram of this model, which
considers a nearest neighbor interaction, $V$, in addition to the on-site term
$U$. To perform our study, we utilize the determinant quantum Monte Carlo
method simulations, where the average sign of the determinant is used to
extract information about the quantum critical points. When both $U$ and $V$
are positive, the on-site term favors antiferromagnetism (AFM), while the
extended interaction favors the formation of a charge density wave (CDW). In
cases where at least one of the interactions is negative, superconductivity
competes with the above-mentioned phases, and the system displays phase
separation for intense attractive extended interaction. Our findings indicate
that only $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing symmetries exist in such scenarios.

<h3>Self-learning mechanical circuits</h3>

Computation, mechanics and materials merge in biological systems, which can
continually self-optimize through internal adaptivity across length scales,
from cytoplasm and biofilms to animal herds. Recent interest in such
material-based computation uses the principles of energy minimization, inertia
and dissipation to solve optimization problems. Although specific computations
can be performed using dynamical systems, current implementations of material
computation lack the ability to self-learn. In particular, the inverse problem
of designing self-learning mechanical systems which can use physical
computations to continuously self-optimize remains poorly understood. Here we
introduce the concept of self-learning mechanical circuits, capable of taking
mechanical inputs from changing environments and constantly updating their
internal state in response, thus representing an entirely mechanical
information processing unit. Our circuits are composed of a new mechanical
construct: an adaptive directed spring (ADS), which changes its stiffness in a
directional manner, enabling neural network-like computations. We provide both
a theoretical foundation and experimental realization of these elastic learning
units and demonstrate their ability to autonomously uncover patterns hidden in
environmental inputs. By implementing computations in an embodied physical
manner, the system directly interfaces with its environment, thus broadening
the scope of its learning behavior. Our results pave the way towards the
construction of energy-harvesting, adaptive materials which can autonomously
and continuously sense and self-optimize to gain function in different
environments.

<h3>LiY(SO$_4$)$_2$: A Superionic Material Synthesized by Superionic State  Hidden in no-Superionic Literature</h3>

<br>
<br>
A potential superionic material LiY(SO$_4$)$_2$ has been excavated from the
published literatures because its synthesis method and experiment data implied
it exists the superionic state. We use \textit{ab initio} calculation to
analyzing the differences between solid state and superionic state. We found
the diffusion of Li$^+$ from the lattice site to the interstitial site will
change the nearest neighbor numbers of O atom from 4 to 8. In order to reduce
energy, the reorientation of SO$_4^{2-}$ must exist accompany with the
diffusion of Li$^+$ so the nearest neighbor number of O will keep about 5 in
the superionic state. Our work not only presents an example for discovering
materials from literatures based on prior knowledge but also reveals the
micromechanism of cation-anion coupled dynamics for superionic state.

We investigate the speed limits and dissipation-time trade-off relation for
classical stochastic processes with time-independent transition rates. Our
results show that the time required to evolve from an initial to a desired
target state is bounded from below by the informational-theoretic
$\infty$-R\'enyi divergence between these states, divided by the total rate.
Furthermore, we present a new dissipation-time trade-off relation that
outperforms previous bounds and only requires knowledge of the total rate.

Ordered phases realized through broken continuous symmetries embrace
long-range order-parameter fluctuations as manifest in the power-law decays of
both the transverse and longitudinal correlations, which are similar to those
at the second-order transition point. We calculate the transverse one-loop
correction to the dispersion relation of nonrelativistic Nambu-Goldstone (NG)
bosons at finite temperatures, assuming that they have well-defined dispersion
relations with some integer exponents. It is found that the transverse
correlations make the lifetime of the NG bosons vanish right on the assumed
dispersion curve below three dimensions at finite temperatures. Combined with
the vanishing of the longitudinal "mass", the result indicates that the
correlations generally bring both an intrinsic lifetime to the excitations and
a qualitative change in the dispersion relation at long wavelengths below three
dimensions at finite temperatures, unless it is protected by some conservation
law. A more detailed calculation performed specifically on a single-component
Bose-Einstein condensate reveals that the gapless Bogoliubov mode predicted by
the perturbative treatment is modified substantially after incorporating the
correlations to have (i) an intrinsic lifetime and (ii) a peak shift at long
wavelengths from the linear dispersion relation. Thus, the NG bosons may be
fluctuating intrinsically into and out of the ordered "vacuum" to maintain the
order temporally.

<h3>Anomalous impact of thermal fluctuations on spintransfer torque induced  ferrimagnetic switching</h3>

<br>
<br>
The dynamics of a spin torque driven ferrimagnetic (FiM) system is
investigated using the two-sublattice macrospin model. We demonstrate an
ultrafast switching in the picosecond range. However, we find that the
excessive current leads to the magnetic oscillation. Therefore, faster
switching cannot be achieved by unlimitedly increasing the current. By
systematically studying the impact of thermal fluctuations, we find the
dynamics of FiMs can also be distinguished into the precessional region, the
thermally activated region, and the cross-over region. However, in the
precessional region, there is a significant deviation between FiM and
ferromagnet (FM), i.e., the FM is insensitive to thermal fluctuations since its
switching is only determined by the amount of net charge. In contrast, we find
that the thermal effect is pronounced even a very short current pulse is
applied to the FiM. We attribute this anomalous effect to the complex relation
between the anisotropy and overdrive current. By controlling the magnetic
anisotropy, we demonstrate that the FiM can also be configured to be
insensitive to thermal fluctuations. This controllable thermal property makes
the FiM promising in many emerging applications such as the implementation of
tunable activation functions in the neuromorphic computing.

<br>
<br>
Using high-resolution extreme ultraviolet resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
(EUVRIXS) spectroscopy at Cu M-edge, we observed the doping dependent spectral
shifts of inter-orbital (dd) excitations of YBa_2Cu_3O_(7-x) and
La_(2-x)Sr_xCuO_4. With increasing hole doping level from undoped to optimally
doped superconducting compositions, the leading edge of dd excitations is found
to shift towards lower energy loss in a roughly linear trend that is
irrespective to the cuprate species. The magnitude of energy shift can be
explained by including a 0.15 eV Coulomb attraction between Cu 3d_(x^2-y^2)
electrons and the doped holes on the surrounding oxygens in the atomic
multiplet calculations. The consistent energy shift between distinct cuprate
families suggests that this inter-site Coulomb interaction energy scale is
relatively material-independent, and provides an important reference point for
understanding charge density wave phenomena in the cuprate phase diagram.

<h3>Linear scaling relationship of Néel temperature and dominant magnons  in pyrochlore ruthenates</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a systematic Raman spectroscopy study on a series of pyrochlore
ruthenates, a system which is not yet clearly settled on its magnetic origin
and structure. Apart from the Raman-active phonon modes, new peaks that appear
in the energy range of 15 - 35 meV below the N\'{e}el temperature are assigned
as one-magnon modes. The temperature evolution of one-magnon modes displays no
significant thermal dependence in mode frequencies while the intensities
decrease monotonically. Remarkably, one-magnons from all compounds show similar
characteristics with a single dominant peak at lower energy and weaker side
peaks at a couple of meV higher energy. Most importantly, we uncover a striking
proportionality between the dominant magnon mode energies and the N\'{e}el
temperatures. Our results suggest the Ru ions may have similar or the same
magnetic phase in all pyrochlore ruthenates of our study. We have thus found an
avenue for directly tuning the magnetic exchange interaction by the selection
of the $A$-site ion.

<h3>Role of magnetic field on the electronic properties of an $α$-$T_3$  ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08830" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08830</a>
<br>
<i>Mijanur Islam, Tutul Biswas, Saurabh Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a quantum ring of a certain radius R built from a sheet of the
$\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice and solve for its spectral properties in presence of an
external magnetic field. The energy spectrum consists of a conduction band, a
valence band and a zero energy flat band, all having a number of discrete
levels therein which can be characterized by the angular momentum quantum
number, m. The energy levels in the flat band are infinitely degenerate
irrespective of the value of $\alpha$. We reveal a two-fold degeneracy of the
levels in the conduction band as well as in the valence band for $\alpha$ = 0
and $\alpha$ = 1. However, the m = 0 level for $\alpha$ = 1 is an exception.
Corresponding to an intermediate value of $\alpha$, namely, 0 <$\alpha$< 1, the
energy levels become nondegenerate. The scenario remains unaltered when the
ring is threaded by a magnetic flux which is an integer multiple of the flux
quantum. We also calculate the persistent current which exhibits quantum
oscillations as a function of the magnetic field with a period of one flux
quantum at a particular Dirac point, which is often referred to as a valley.
The total current oscillates with a periodicity of one flux quantum for any
intermediate value of $\alpha$. We have also explored the effect of a mass term
(that breaks the sublattice symmetry) in the Hamiltonian. In the absence of a
magnetic field, the energy levels in the flat band become dispersive, except
for the m = 0 level in the case of $\alpha$ = 1. In presence of the field, each
of the flat band levels becomes dispersive for any $\alpha \neq$ 0. Finally, we
also see the effect of the mass term on the behaviour of the persistent
current, which shows periodicity of one flux quantum, but the total current
remains finite for all values of $\alpha$.

<br>
<br>
We study non-normalizable quasi-equilibrium states (NNQE) arising from
anomalous diffusion. Initially, particles in contact with a thermal bath are
released from an asymptotically flat potential well, with dynamics that is
described by fractional calculus. For temperatures that are sufficiently low
compared to the potential depth, the properties of the system remain almost
constant in time. We use the fractional-time Fokker-Planck equation (FTFPE) and
continuous-time random walk approaches to calculate the ensemble averages of
observables. We obtain analytical estimates of the duration of NNQE, depending
on the fractional order, from approximate theoretical solutions of the FTFPE.
We study and compare two types of observables, the mean square displacement
typically used to characterize diffusion, and the thermodynamic energy. We show
that the typical time scales for stagnation depend exponentially on the
activation energy in units of temperature multiplied by a function of the
fractional exponent.

<h3>Dispersion engineering in spin-orbit coupled spinor $F=1$ condensates  driven by negative masses</h3>

<br>
<i>K. Rajaswathi, S. Bhuvaneswari, R. Radha, P. Muruganandam</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the impact of negative mass on expanding spin-orbit (SO)
coupled spinor $F=1$ Bose-Einstein condensates by analyzing the dispersion
relation of the single-particle quantum system. In SO-coupled spinor
condensates, a negative mass parameter generates a wave packet that propagates
in the opposite direction of the momentum. We analyze the dynamics of spin
waves analytically and present a simple approach to investigate the expansion
of spinor condensates. In particular, we examine the dynamics when both masses
are negative, which results in the spinor condensate splitting into two
counter-propagating self-interfering packets (SIPs). Using numerical
simulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, we demonstrate the
density expansion and self-interference patterns with and without magnetization
for repulsive and attractive interactions with different coupling parameters.
Our investigation hasc unearthed several phenomena observed in experiments,
such as symmetric expansion dynamics, SIPs, pileup, modulation instability,
slow down, and self-trapping. Furthermore, we notice that a phase diagram of
expansion velocities could be used to identify a quantum phase transition, from
a plane wave phase to a stripe phase, based on the strengths of SO coupling,
Rabi coupling, and interaction.

<br>
<br>
The interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling rare-earth/transition-metal bilayer
ferrimagnet systems have attracted much attention because they present
variously unusual temperature-and field-dependent nontrivial magnetic states
and dynamics. These properties and the implementation of their applications in
spintronics highly depend on the significant temperature dependence of the
magnetic exchange stiffness constant A. Here, we quantitatively determine the
temperature dependence of magnetic exchange stiffness A_{Py-Gd} and A_{Gd} in
the artificially layered ferrimagnet consisting of a Py/Gd bilayer, using a
measurement of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of the bilayer thin film at
different temperatures and magnetic fields. The obtained temperature dependence
of A_{Py-Gd} and A_{Gd} exhibit a scaling power law with the magnetization of
Gd. The critical field of spin-flop transition and its temperature dependence
can also be directly obtained by this method. Additionally, the experimental
results are well reproduced by micromagnetic simulations with the obtained
parameters A_{Py-Gd} and A_{Gd}, which further confirms the reliability of this
easily accessible technique.

<h3>Machine-learning detection of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless  transition and the second-order phase transition in the XXZ models</h3>

<br>
<i>Yusuke Miyajima, Masahito Mochizuki</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose two machine-learning methods based on neural networks, which we
respectively call the phase-classification method and the
temperature-identification method, for detecting different types of phase
transitions in the XXZ models without prior knowledge of their critical
temperatures. The XXZ models have exchange couplings which are anisotropic in
the spin space where the strength is represented by a parameter $\Delta(>0)$.
The models exhibit the second-order phase transition when $\Delta>1$, whereas
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition when $\Delta<1$. In
the phase-classification method, the neural network is trained using spin or
vortex configurations of well-known classical spin models other than the XXZ
models, e.g., the Ising models and the XY models, to classify those of the XXZ
models to corresponding phases. We demonstrate that the trained neural network
successfully detects the phase transitions for both $\Delta>1$ and $\Delta<1$,
and the evaluated critical temperatures coincide well with those evaluated by
conventional numerical calculations. In the temperature-identification method,
on the other hand, the neural network is trained so as to identify temperatures
at which the input spin or vortex configurations are generated by the Monte
Carlo thermalization. The critical temperatures are evaluated by analyzing the
optimized weight matrix, which coincide with the result of numerical
calculation for the second-order phase transition in the Ising-like XXZ model
with $\Delta=1.05$ but cannot be determined uniquely for the BKT transition in
the XY-like XXZ model with $\Delta=0.95$.

Resonant absorption of a photon by bound electrons in a solid can promote an
electron to another orbital state or transfer it to a neighboring atomic site.
Such a transition in a magnetically ordered material could affect the magnetic
order. While this process is an obvious road map for optical control of
magnetization, experimental demonstration of such a process remains
challenging. Exciting a significant fraction of magnetic ions requires a very
intense incoming light beam, as orbital resonances are often weak compared to
above-band-gap excitations. In the latter case, a sizeable reduction of the
magnetization occurs as the absorbed energy increases the spin temperature,
masking the non-thermal optical effects. Here, using ultrafast x-ray
spectroscopy, we were able to resolve changes in the magnetization state
induced by resonant absorption of infrared photons in Co-doped yttrium iron
garnet, with negligible thermal effects. We found that the optical excitation
of the Co ions affects the two distinct magnetic Fe sublattices differently,
resulting in a transient non-collinear magnetic state. The present results
indicate that the all-optical magnetization switching most likely occurs due to
the creation of a transient, non-collinear magnetic state followed by coherent
spin rotations of the Fe moments.

Memory can remarkably modify the collective behaviors of active particles. In
Quincke systems driven by electric fields, the memory of particles, in the form
of relaxation of polarization, has been taken to account for the run-and-tumble
behaviors under periodical driving. However, we show that the memory of Quincke
particles is generally a product of multiple mechanisms including inertia and
depolarization. The memory of Quincke particles can be tuned and enhanced by
the parameters of electric fields. Moreover, the interplay between inertia and
propulsion results in a frequency-dependent mobility such that a balance
between activity and attraction can be reached, giving rise to the formation of
dense active clusters. The memory in dense clusters becomes even more
significant because of the strong electrostatic interactions. Combining the
tunable memory and the adjustable mobility, a rich variety of collective
motions can be realized. These findings offer new insights into the dynamics of
active matter and have broad interests in periodically driven active systems.

Specific types of spatial defects or potentials can turn monolayer graphene
into a topological material. These topological defects are classified by a
spatial dimension $D$ and they are systematically obtained from the Hamiltonian
by means of its symbol $\mathcal{H} (\boldsymbol{k}, \boldsymbol{r}) $, an
operator which generalises the Bloch Hamiltonian and contains all topological
information. This approach, when applied to Dirac operators, allows to recover
the tenfold classification of insulators and superconductors. The existence of
a stable $\mathbb{Z}$-topology is predicted as a condition on the dimension
$D$, similar to the classification of defects in thermodynamic phase
transitions. Kekule distortions, vacancies and adatoms in graphene are proposed
as examples of such defects and their topological equivalence is discussed.

In this article, we report some examples of how high-energy electron
irradiation can be used as a tool for shaping material properties turning the
generation of point-defects into an advantage beyond the presumed degradation

occurs when irradiation is used as a test for radiation hard materials or
devices degradation in harsh environments. We illustrate the potential of this
emerging technique by results obtained on two families of materials, namely

Dense or glassy active matter, as a result of its remarkable resemblance to
passive glass-forming materials, is enjoying increasing scientific interest. To
better grasp the subtle effect of active motion on the process of
vitrification, a number of active mode-coupling theories (MCTs) have recently
been developed. These have proven capable of qualitatively predicting important
parts of the active glassy phenomenology. However, most efforts so far have
only considered single-component materials, and their derivations are arguably
more complex than the standard MCT case, which might hinder broader usage. Here
we present a detailed derivation of a distinct active MCT for mixtures of
athermal self-propelled particles that is more transparent than previously
introduced versions. The key insight is that we can follow a similar strategy
for our overdamped active system as is typically used for passive underdamped
MCT. Interestingly, when only considering one particle species, our theory
gives the exact same result as the one obtained in previous work which employed
a highly different mode-coupling strategy. Moreover, we assess the quality of
the theory and its novel extension to multi-component materials by using it to
predict the dynamics of a Kob-Andersen mixture of athermal active Brownian
quasi-hard spheres. We demonstrate that our theory is able to capture all
qualitative features, most notably the location of the optimum of the dynamics
when the persistence length and cage length coincide, for each combination of
particle types.

The Halperin $(m',m,n)$ fractional quantum Hall effects of two-component
quantum particles are studied in topological checkerboard lattice models. Here
for $m\neq m'$, we demonstrate the emergence of fractional quantum hall effects
with the associated $\mathbf{K}=\begin{pmatrix} m+2 & 1\\ 1 & m\\
\end{pmatrix}$ matrix (even $m=2$ for boson and odd $m=3$ for fermion) in the
presence of both strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. Through
exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we
elucidate their topological fractionalizations, including (i) the
$\det|\mathbf{K}|=(m^2+2m-1)$-fold ground-state degeneracies and (ii)
fractionally quantized topological Chern number matrix
$\mathbf{C}=\mathbf{K}^{-1}$. Our flat band model provides a paradigmatic

<br>
<br>
The optical properties of two-dimensional materials are exceptional in
several respects. They are highly anisotropic and frequently dominated by
excitonic effects. Dipole-allowed second order non-linear optical properties
require broken inversion symmetry. Hence, several two-dimensional materials
show strong in-plane (IP) non-linearity but negligible out-of-plane (OOP)
response due to vertical symmetry. By considering buckled hexagonal monolayers,
we analyze the critical role of broken vertical symmetry on their excitonic
optical response. Both linear as well as second order shift current and second
harmonic response are studied. We demonstrate that substantial OOP non-linear
response can be obtained, in particular, through off-diagonal tensor elements
coupling IP excitation to OOP response. Our findings are explained by excitonic
selection rules for OOP response and the impact of dielectric screening on
excitons is elucidated.

The computational study of energy storage and conversion processes call for
simulation techniques that can reproduce the electronic response of metal
electrodes under electric fields. Despite recent advancements in
machine-learning methods applied to electronic-structure properties, predicting
the non-local behaviour of the charge density in electronic conductors remains
a major open challenge. We combine long-range and equivariant kernel methods to
predict the Kohn-Sham electron density of metal electrodes decomposed on an
atom-centered basis. By taking slabs of gold as an example, we show that
including long-range correlations into the learning model is essential to
accurately reproduce the charge density and potential in bare electrodes of
increasing size. A finite-field extension of the method is then introduced,
which allows us to predict the charge transfer and the electrostatic potential
drop induced by the application of an external electric field. Finally, we
demonstrate the capability of the method to extrapolate the non-local
electronic polarization generated by the interaction with an ionic species for
electrodes of arbitrary thickness. Our study represents an important step
forward in the accurate simulation of energy materials that include metallic
interfaces.

We study the influence of Coulomb correlations on spectral and magnetic
properties of fcc cobalt using a combination of density functional theory and
dynamical mean-field theory. The computed uniform and local magnetic
susceptibilities obey the Curie-Weiss law, which, as we demonstrate, occurs due
to the partial formation of local magnetic moments. We find that the lifetime
of these moments in cobalt is significantly less than in bcc iron, suggesting a
more itinerant magnetism in cobalt. In contrast to the bcc iron, the obtained
electronic self-energies exhibit a quasiparticle shape with the quasiparticle
mass enhancement factor ${m^*/m}\sim$1.8, corresponding to moderately
correlated metal. Finally, our calculations reveal that the static magnetic
susceptibility of cobalt is dominated by ferromagnetic correlations, as
evidenced by its momentum dependence.

Recent experimental study by Dias et al claims to have discovered
room-temperature superconductivity in lutetium-nitrogen-hydrogen system at 1
GPa [Nature 615, 244 (2023)], which sheds light on the long-held dream of
ambient superconductivity. However, the compositions and the crystal structures
of the lutetium-nitrogen-hydrogen system remain unknown. By employing the
density functional theory based structure prediction algorithm, we show that in
lutetium-nitrogen-hydrogen the major component is LuH2, together with minor
LuN. The blue LuH2 at ambient pressure will turn into purple and red color at
higher pressures, possibly accompanied by the formation of vacancies at
hydrogen-sites. In LuH2 and LuN, the density of states at the Fermi level is
dominated by the Lu-5d orbitals, while those from hydrogen and nitrogen are
very small, leading to the absence of superconductivity in these two compounds.
Nitrogen-doping to LuH2 fails to enhance the superconductivity as well.

We extend and apply a recently introduced quasi-particle functional

next-nearest-neighbour hopping and away from half filling. We confirm the
generation of superconducting correlations in some regions of the phase
diagram, but also find that the inclusion of self-energy feedback by means of a
decreasing quasi-particle weight can suppress superconducting tendencies more
than anti-ferromagnetic correlations by which they are generated. As a
supplement, we provide sample results for the self-energy in second-order

As an A-site-vacant perovskite-type oxide, ReO3 undergoes sequential
pressure-driven structural transitions associated with the rotation of ReO6
octahedra. The rhombohedral-I phase stable in the pressure range of 12-38 GPa
is featured by a lattice of nearly close-packed oxygen layers intercalated with
Re cations, in reminiscent of the recently discovered superhydride
superconductors. A combined study of first-principles calculations and
transport measurements under high pressures enabled us to discover
superconductivity in the rhombohedral-I phase showing a dome-shaped Tc(P) with
a maximum Tc of 17 K at about 30 GPa. In addition to the enhanced density of
states at the Fermi level compared to that of the ambient phase, the
low-frequency vibrations of hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice significantly
strengthen the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for observed
superconductivity with a relatively high Tc. The present work thus establishes
a rare case among oxide superconductors that the light-element oxygen lattice
plays a crucial role in inducing superconductivity.

Excitonic condensation and superfluidity have recently received a renewed
attention, due to the fabrication of bilayer systems in which electrons and
hole are spatially separated and form stable pairs known as indirect excitons.
Dichalcogenides- and graphene- based bilayers are nowadays built and
investigated, giving access to systems with (i) only spin degeneracy, (ii) spin
and valley degeneracy. Simulation studies performed in the last decade at $T=0$
for simple, model electron-hole bilayers, as function of inter-layer distance
and in-layer carrier density, have revealed in case (i) the formation of
biexcitons in a tiny region of parameter space and in case (ii) the formation
of stable compounds made of 4 electrons and 4 holes (quadriexcitons) in a
sizable region of parameter space. Of some interest is the relation of the
properties of isolated biexcitons (quadriexcitons) and those of their finite
density counterpart. In fact, the isolated biexciton has been repeatedly
studied in the last years with simulations and other techniques. No
simulations, instead, are available to our knowledge for the isolated
quadriexciton, for which we present here results of the first quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) study. Stability with respect to the dissociation into biexcitons,
and the pair correlations with varying the inter-layer distance $d$ are
discussed.

Magnons, the collective excitations of spin systems, have been proposed as a
platform to induce conventional and unconventional superconductivity in
magnetic solid-state devices. In this article, we study the induced interaction
of spin-like collective excitations in an ultracold gas of hard-core bosons. We
show that the induced interaction supports two-body states with energies,
symmetries, and a number of bound states strongly dependent on the properties
of the hard-core boson gas. The ability to control the nature of the two-body
bound states motivates the study of superfluid phases, which we address within
the BKT theory. We demonstrate how the superfluid parameters and critical
temperatures can be tuned in our system. Our findings may pave the way for
future theoretical and experimental studies with ultracold gases and
solid-state systems.

<h3>Repulsion driven metallic phase in the ground state of the half-filled  $t-t^{\prime}$ ionic Hubbard chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
An unusual metallic phase is proven to develop in the one dimensional ionic
Hubbard model, at half-filling and zero magnetization, at intermediate
electron-electron repulsion $U$ when second neighbors hopping is allowed and
tuned close to a topological Lifshitz transition (connected with a change of
the Fermi surface in the non-interacting system). The metallic state lies
between a band insulator phase at low repulsion and a correlated (Mott-like)
insulator phase at high repulsion. In approaching the later, the metal supports
spontaneous bond charge dimerization and antiferromagnetic correlations. The
ground state of the system, attainable by cold atoms in optical lattices for a
wide range of the parameter $U$, is extensively explored by numerically exact
density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) calculations. A combination of mean
field and effective field theory (bosonization) provides an analytical
understanding of the physical processes underlying the observed phase
transitions.

<h3>Edge-selective extremal damping from topological heritage of dissipative  Chern insulators</h3>

One of the most important practical hallmarks of topological matter is the
presence of topologically protected, exponentially localised edge states at
interfaces of regions characterised by unequal topological invariants. Here, we
show that even when driven far from their equilibrium ground state, Chern
insulators can inherit topological edge features from their parent Hamiltonian.
In particular, we show that the asymptotic long-time approach of the
non-equilibrium steady state, governed by a Lindblad Master equation, can
exhibit edge-selective extremal damping. This phenomenon derives from edge
states of non-Hermitian extensions of the parent Chern insulator Hamiltonian.
The combination of (non-Hermitian) topology and dissipation hence allows to
design topologically robust, spatially localised damping patterns.

Systematic microcanonical inflection-point analysis of precise numerical
results obtained in extensive generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo simulations
reveals a bifurcation of the coil-globule transition line for polymers with a
bending stiffness exceeding a threshold value. The region, enclosed by the
toroidal and random-coil phases, is dominated by structures crossing over from
hairpins to loops upon lowering the energy. Conventional canonical statistical
analysis is not sufficiently sensitive to allow for the identification of these

Wigner functions are broadly used to probe non-classical effects in the
macroscopic world. Here we develop an orbital-free functional framework to
compute the 1-body Wigner quasi-probability for both fermionic and bosonic
systems. Since the key variable is a quasi-density, this theory is particularly
well suited to circumvent the problem of finding the Pauli potential or
approximating the kinetic energy in orbital-free density functional theory. As
proof of principle, we find that the universal functional for the building
block of optical lattices results from a translation, a contraction, and a
rotation of the corresponding functional of the 1-body reduced density matrix,
indicating a strong connection between these functional theories. Furthermore,
we relate the concepts of Wigner negativity and $v$-representability, and find
a manifold of ground states with negative Wigner functions.

Silicon carbide (SiC) is an important semiconductor material for fabricating
power electronic devices that exhibit higher switch frequency, lower energy
loss and substantial reduction both in size and weight in comparison with its
Si-based counterparts1-4. Currently, most devices, such as
metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors, which are core devices used
in electric vehicles, photovoltaic industry and other applications, are
fabricated on a hexagonal polytype 4H-SiC because of its commercial
availability5. Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC), the only cubic polytype, has a
moderate band gap of 2.36 eV at room-temperature, but a superior mobility and
thermal conduction than 4H-SiC4,6-11. Moreover, the much lower concentration of
interfacial traps between insulating oxide gate and 3C-SiC helps fabricate
reliable and long-life devices7-10,12-14. The growth of 3C-SiC crystals,
however, has remained a challenge up to now despite of decades-long efforts by
researchers because of its easy transformation into other polytypes during
growth15-19, limiting the 3C-SiC based devices. Here, we report that 3C-SiC can
be made thermodynamically favored from nucleation to growth on a 4H-SiC
substrate by top-seeded solution growth technique(TSSG), beyond what's expected
by classic nucleation theory. This enables the steady growth of quality and
large sized 3C-SiC crystals (2~4-inch in diameter and 4.0~10.0 mm in thickness)
sustainable. Our findings broaden the mechanism of hetero-seed crystal growth
and provide a feasible route to mass production of 3C-SiC crystals,offering new
opportunities to develop power electronic devices potentially with better
performances than those based on 4H-SiC.

Emergent phases often appear when the electronic kinetic energy is comparable
to the Coulomb interactions. One approach to seek material systems as hosts of
such emergent phases is to realize localization of electronic wavefunctions due
to the geometric frustration inherent in the crystal structure, resulting in
flat electronic bands. Recently, such efforts have found a wide range of exotic
phases in the two-dimensional kagome lattice, including magnetic order,
time-reversal symmetry breaking charge order, nematicity, and
superconductivity. However, the interlayer coupling of the kagome layers
disrupts the destructive interference needed to completely quench the kinetic
energy. Here we experimentally demonstrate that an interwoven kagome network--a
pyrochlore lattice--can host a three dimensional (3D) localization of electron
wavefunctions. In particular, through a combination of angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, fundamental lattice model and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, we present the novel electronic structure of a
pyrochlore superconductor, CeRu$_2$. We find striking flat bands with
bandwidths smaller than 0.03 eV in all directions--an order of magnitude
smaller than that of kagome systems. We further find 3D gapless Dirac cones
predicted originally by theory in the diamond lattice space group with
nonsymmorphic symmetry. Our work establishes the pyrochlore structure as a
promising lattice platform to realize and tune novel emergent phases
intertwining topology and many-body interactions.

Controlling materials to create and tune topological phases of matter could
potentially be used to explore new phases of topological quantum matter and to
create novel devices where the carriers are topologically protected. It has
been demonstrated that a trivial insulator can be converted into a topological
state by modulating the spin-orbit interaction or the crystal lattice. However,
there are limited methods to controllably and efficiently tune the crystal
lattice and at the same time perform electronic measurements at cryogenic
temperatures. Here, we use large controllable strain to demonstrate the
topological phase transition from a weak topological insulator phase to a
strong topological insulator phase in high-quality HfTe5 samples. After
applying high strain to HfTe5 and converting it into a strong topological
insulator, we found that the sample's resistivity increased by more than two
orders of magnitude (24,000%) and that the electronic transport is dominated by
the topological surface states at cryogenic temperatures. Our findings show
that HfTe5 is an ideal material for engineering topological properties, and it
could be generalized to study topological phase transitions in van der Waals
materials and heterostructures. These results can pave the way to create novel
devices with applications ranging from spintronics to fault-tolerant
topologically protected quantum computers.

<h3>Single-test evaluation of directional elastic properties of anisotropic  structured materials</h3>

When the elastic properties of structured materials become
direction-dependent, the number of their descriptors increases. For example, in
two-dimensions, the anisotropic behavior of materials is described by up to 6
independent elastic stiffness parameters, as opposed to only 2 needed for
isotropic materials. Such high number of parameters expands the design space of
structured materials and leads to unusual phenomena, such as materials that can
shear under uniaxial compression. However, an increased number of properties
descriptors and the coupling between shear and normal deformations render the
experimental evaluation of material properties more challenging. In this paper,
we propose a methodology based on the virtual fields method to identify six
separate stiffness tensor parameters of two-dimensional anisotropic structured
materials using just one tension test, thus eliminating the need for multiple
experiments, as it is typical in traditional methods. The approach requires no
stress data and uses full-field displacement data and global force data. We
show the accuracy of our method using synthetic data generated from finite
element simulations as well as experimental data from additively manufactured
specimens

Non-equilibrium transport of particles embedded in a liquid crystal host can,
by cooling through a phase transition, be exploited to create a remarkable
variety of structures including shells, foams, and gels. Due to the complexity
of the multicomponent system and protocol-dependent experimental results, the
physical mechanisms behind structure selection remain only partially
understood. Here we formulate a new model coupling LC physics to a
Fokker-Planck equation as is commonly used in studies of transport. The
resulting model allows us to draw an analogy between the LC-nanocomposite
system and chemotaxis, enriching the space of possible target structures that
could be produced. We study the model in one dimension both analytically and
numerically to identify different parameter regimes where soliton-like pulses
of particles ``surf'' the phase boundary or where the interface ``sweeps''
particles from one domain to another. We also consider an extended model that
includes agglomeration of the particles and observe formation of periodic
structures as a prototypical example of hierarchical self assembly. Results are
compared with experimental observations of transport by isolated phase
boundaries.

The lattice strain induced by metallic electrodes can impair the
functionality of advanced quantum devices operating with electron or hole
spins. Here we investigate the deformation induced by CMOS-manufactured
titanium nitride electrodes on the lattice of a buried, 10 nm-thick Si/SiGe
Quantum Well by means of nanobeam Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy. We
were able to measure TiN electrode-induced local modulations of the strain
tensor components in the range of $2 - 8 \times 10^{-4}$ with ~60 nm lateral
resolution. We have evaluated that these strain fluctuations are reflected into
local modulations of the potential of the conduction band minimum larger than 2
meV, which is close to the orbital energy of an electrostatic quantum dot. We
observe that the sign of the strain modulations at a given depth of the quantum
well layer depends on the lateral dimensions of the electrodes. Since our work
explores the impact of device geometry on the strain-induced energy landscape,
it enables further optimization of the design of scaled CMOS-processed quantum
devices.

Hyperuniform many-particle systems are characterized by a structure factor
$S({\mathbf{k}})$ that is precisely zero as $|\mathbf{k}|\rightarrow0$; and
stealthy hyperuniform systems have $S({\mathbf{k}})=0$ for the finite range $0
< |{\mathbf{k}}| \le K$, called the "exclusion region." Through a process of
collective-coordinate optimization, energy-minimizing disordered stealthy
hyperuniform systems of moderate size have been made to high accuracy, and
their novel physical properties have shown great promise. However, minimizing
$S(\mathbf{k})$ in the exclusion region is computationally intensive as the
system size becomes large. In this Letter, we present an improved methodology
to generate such states using double-double precision calculations on GPUs that
reduces the deviations from zero within the exclusion region by a factor of
approximately $10^{30}$ for systems sizes more than an order of magnitude
larger. We further show that this ultra-high accuracy is required to draw
conclusions about their corresponding characteristics, such as the nature of
the associated energy landscape and the presence or absence of Anderson
localization, which might be masked, even when deviations are relatively small.

We consider a stack of parallel sheets composed of conducting planes with
tensorial conductivities. Using the scattering matrix approach, we derive
explicit formulas for the Casimir energy of two, three, and four planes, as
well as a recurrence relation for arbitrary planes. Specifically, for a stack
of graphene, we solve the recurrence relations and obtain formulas for the
Casimir energy and force acting on the planes within the stack. Moreover, we
calculate the binding energy in the graphene stack with graphite interplane
separation, which amounts to $E_{ib} = 9.9$ meV/atom. Notably, the Casimir
force on graphene sheets decreases rapidly for planes beyond the first one. In
particular, for the second graphene layer in the stack, the force is $35$ times
smaller than that experienced by the first layer.

The insensitivity of photons towards external magnetic fields forms one of
the hardest barriers against efficient magneto-optical control, aiming at
modulating the polarization state of light. However, there is even scarcer
evidence of magneto-optical effects that can spatially modulate light. Here, we
demonstrate the latter by exploiting strongly coupled states of semimagnetic
matter and light in planar semiconductor microcavities. We nonresonantly excite
two spatially adjacent exciton-polariton condensates which, through inherent
ballistic near field coupling mechanism, spontaneously synchronise into a
dissipative quantum fluidic supermode of definite parity. Applying a magnetic
field along the optical axis, we continuously adjust the light-matter
composition of the condensate exciton-polaritons, inducing a supermode switch
into a higher order mode of opposite parity. Our findings set the ground
towards magnetic spatial modulation of nonlinear light.

The long range electronic modulations recently discovered in the
geometrically frustrated kagome lattice have opened new avenues to explore the
effect of correlations in materials with topological electron flat bands. The
observation of the lattice response to the emergent new phases of matter, a
soft phonon mode, has remained elusive and the microscopic origin of charge
density waves (CDWs) is still unknown. Here, we show, for the first time, a
complete melting of the ScV$_ 6$Sn$_ 6$ (166) kagome lattice. The low energy
phonon with propagation vector $\frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{2}$ collapses
at 98 K, without the emergence of long-range charge order, which sets in with a
propagation vector $\frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3}$. The CDW is driven
(but locks at a different vector) by the softening of an overdamped phonon flat
plane at k$_z$=$\pi$. We observe broad phonon anomalies in momentum space,
pointing to (1) the existence of approximately flat phonon bands which gain
some dispersion due to electron renormalization, and (2) the effects of the
momentum dependent electron-phonon interaction in the CDW formation. Ab initio
and analytical calculations corroborate the experimental findings to indicate
that the weak leading order phonon instability is located at the wave vector
$\frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{2}$ of a rather flat collapsed mode. We
analytically compute the phonon frequency renormalization from high
temperatures to the soft mode, and relate it to a peak in the orbital-resolved
susceptibility, obtaining an excellent match with both ab initio and
experimental results, and explaining the origin of the approximately flat
phonon dispersion. Our data report the first example of the collapse of a
softening of a flat phonon plane and promote the 166 compounds of the kagome
family as primary candidates to explore correlated flat phonon-topological flat
electron physics.
