<h3>Péclet dependent Interactions of Self-Propelled Droplets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13740" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13740</a>
<br>
</p><i>Prateek Dwivedi, Sobiya Ashraf, Pawan Kumar, Dipin Pillai, Rahul Mangal</i>
<p>Interactions among biologically active agents is facilitated by their
self-generated chemical and hydrodynamic fields. In order to elucidate the
pair-wise interactions between such micro-organisms, we employ active droplets
as a model system, capable of self-generating chemical and hydrodynamic fields.
We demonstrate that the solute P\'eclet number ($Pe$), characterizing the
relative strength of its convective to diffusive transport, plays a crucial
role in determining how the chemical and hydrodynamic fields impact their
interactions. Our findings reveal that at low $Pe$, the interaction is
predominantly governed by chemo-repulsive effects, leading to droplets avoiding
physical contact. Conversely, at elevated $Pe$, hydrodynamic interactions
become more influential, leading to physical engagement. However, irrespective
of $Pe$, the interaction of a droplet with the chemical trail of another
droplet is always governed by chemo-repulsive effects. Furthermore, our results
establish that the chemo-repulsive deflection/rebounding of droplets is
influenced by the droplets' inherent chemical polarity, as determined by its
$Pe$, independent of their approach orientation. Our findings offer a
methodology for tuning the outcomes of binary interactions among chemically
active droplets, laying the groundwork for potential studies on their
collective dynamics.

<h3>Navier-Stokes equations for nearly integrable quantum gases</h3>

</p><i>Maciej Łebek, Miłosz Panfil</i>
<p>The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing
hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in
transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations
arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body
systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable
models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking
into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport
coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two
regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the resulting fluid. We
illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an
experimentally relevant case of coupled 1d cold-atomic gases.

<h3>Investigation of phonons and magnons in [Ni80Fe20/Au/Co/Au]N multilayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13052</a>
<br>
</p><i>M. Zdunek, S. Shekhar, S. Mielcarek, A. Trzaskowska</i>
<p>The interaction between phonons and magnons is a widely developing topic,
especially in the field of acoustic spintronics. To discuss this interaction,
it is necessary to observe two different waves (acoustic and spin waves) with
the same frequency and wavelength. In the Ni80Fe20/Au/Co/Au system deposited on
a silicon substrate, we observe the interaction between spin waves and surface
acoustic waves using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. As a result, we
can selectively control (activate or deactivate) the magnetoelastic interaction
between the fundamental spin wave mode and surface acoustic waves by adjusting
the magnetostrictive layer thickness in the multilayer. We demonstrate that by
adjusting the number of layers in a multilayer structure, we can precisely
control the dispersion of surface acoustic waves, with minimal impact on the
fundamental spin wave mode

<p>This research was focused on the efficient collection of experimental
Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) data from scientific literature to address the
challenges of accessing hard-to-find data and improving the quality of
information available for machine learning studies in materials science.
Utilizing a chain of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), we developed a
systematic approach to extract and organize MOF data into a structured format.
Our methodology successfully compiled information from more than 40,000

findings highlight the significant advantage of incorporating experimental data
over relying solely on simulated data for enhancing the accuracy of machine
learning predictions in the field of MOF research.

<h3>Multifunctional graphene-based and amorphous magnetic materials:  synthesis, characterization, and applications in electromagnetic shielding  and advanced gas sensing</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13054</a>

</p><i>Álvaro Peña</i>
<p>This thesis thoroughly investigates the production, characterization, and
applications of graphene-based materials (GBMs) and amorphous magnetic
materials, particularly in electromagnetic shielding and gas sensing. Four main
research lines are pursued: GBM production, GBMs and amorphous magnetic
materials in shielding applications, GBMs in gas sensors, and amorphous
magnetic materials in magnetoelastic resonance-based sensors. Scalable methods
for GBM production are explored, including ball milling, yielding few-layered
mesoporous graphene (FLMG). FLMG enhances electromagnetic shielding when
combined with amorphous magnetic microwires (MW), showing synergistic effects.
FLMG also demonstrates effective NO2 detection in gas sensors, with UV
irradiation improving sensor performance. Amorphous magnetic materials show
promise in magnetoelastic resonance-based sensors for biomedical applications.
Overall, this thesis addresses current limitations in electromagnetic shielding
and gas detection, supported by patents and scientific publications.

<h3>Particle pinning during grain growth -- A new analytical model for  predicting the mean limiting grain size but also grain size heterogeneity in  a 2D polycrystalline context</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13055" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13055</a>
<br>
</p><i>Madeleine Bignon, Marc Bernacki</i>
<p>This study proposes a new analytical model for grain boundary pinning by
second phase particles in two-dimensional polycrystals. This approach not only
considers how particles impede grain growth, but also elucidates their role in
preventing grain disappearance, thereby leading to stabilised microstructures
characterised by heterogeneous grain size distribution comprising a mixture of
small and large grains. By quantifying the number of particles intercepted by
grain boundaries during grain growth or shrinkage, we are able to calculate the
respective sizes and fractions of large and small grains. Furthermore, we
identify ranges of particle surface fractions and particle sizes that maximise
the heterogeneity in grain size. Additionally, we demonstrate the significant
influence of initial grain size on the limiting grain size in pinned
microstructures. Our analytical model's results are compared with those
obtained from full-field level-set simulations conducted in this study and from
phase-field calculations reported in the literature, revealing very good
agreement. Finally, the differences between the proposed model and existing
ones in the literature are discussed.

<h3>Sonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation of two-dimensional CrTe$_3$  under inert conditions</h3>

<p>Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) has been used for the successful fabrication
of nanosheets from a large number of van der Waals materials. While this allows
to study fundamental changes of material properties' associated with reduced
dimensions, it also changes the chemistry of many materials due to a
significant increase of the effective surface area, often accompanied with
enhanced reactivity and accelerated oxidation. To prevent material
decomposition, LPE and processing in inert atmosphere have been developed,
which enables the preparation of pristine nanomaterials, and to systematically
study compositional changes over time for different storage conditions. Here,
we demonstrate the inert exfoliation of the oxidation-sensitive van der Waals
crystal, CrTe$_3$. The pristine nanomaterial was purified and size-selected by
centrifugation, nanosheet dimensions in the fractions quantified by atomic
force microscopy and studied by Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and photo spectroscopic
measurements. We find a dependence of the relative intensities of the CrTe$_3$
Raman modes on the propagation direction of the incident light, which prevents
a correlation of the Raman spectral profile to the nanosheet dimensions. XPS
and EDX reveal that the contribution of surface oxides to the spectra is
reduced after exfoliation compared to the bulk material. Further, the
decomposition mechanism of the nanosheets was studied by time-dependent
extinction measurements after water titration experiments to initially dry
solvents, which suggest that water plays a significant role in the material
decomposition.

<h3>Band Structure Engineering in Highly Crystalline Organic Semiconductors</h3>

<p>Blending of semiconductors for controlling the energy levels (band structure
engineering) is an important technique, in particular, for optoelectronic
applications. The underlying physics is the delocalized Bloch states, which
average over the potential landscape of the blend. For organic semiconductors,
it has been shown that two quite different effects, the dielectric constant and
electrostatic interaction between molecules, can be used to tune the energy gap
and ionization energy of disordered and weakly crystalline organic
semiconductor blends. It is so far not known whether the electronic
delocalization in organic crystals with large bandwidths can contribute to the
energy structure engineering of the blend in a way similar to that in inorganic
semiconductors. Here, we investigate the growth of highly ordered organic
thin-film blends with a similar chemical structure and show the effect of band
structure engineering by spectroscopic methods. We rationalize the experimental
results with comprehensive theoretical simulations, showing that the
delocalization is a significant effect. Our work paves the way for engineering
the band structure of highly ordered organic semiconductor thin films that can
be tailored for the desired optoelectronic device application.

<h3>Nonlinear mechanics of phase-change-induced accretion</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13121" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13121</a>
<br>
</p><i>Satya Prakash Pradhan, Arash Yavari</i>
<p>In this paper, we formulate a continuum theory of solidification within the
context of finite-strain coupled thermoelasticity. We aim to fill a gap in the
existing literature, as the existing studies on solidification typically
decouple the thermal problem (the classical Stefan's problem) from the
elasticity problem, and often limit themselves to linear elasticity with small
strains. Treating solidification as an accretion problem, with the growth
velocity correlated with the jump in the heat flux across the boundary, it
presents an initial boundary-value problem (IBVP) over a domain whose boundary
location is a priori unknown. This IBVP is solved numerically for the specific
example of radially inward solidification in a spherical container. Several
parametric studies are conducted to compare the numerical results with the
rigid cases in the literature and gain insights into the role of elastic
deformations in solidification.

<h3>Effect of the atomic structure of complexions on the active  disconnection mode during shear-coupled grain boundary motion</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13126</a>

</p><i>Swetha Pemma, Rebecca Janisch, Gerhard Dehm, Tobias Brink</i>
<p>The migration of grain boundaries leads to grain growth in polycrystals and
is one mechanism of grain-boundary-mediated plasticity, especially in
nanocrystalline metals. This migration is due to the movement of
dislocation-like defects, called disconnections, which couple to externally
applied shear stresses. While this has been studied in detail in recent years,
the active disconnection mode was typically associated with specific
macroscopic grain boundary parameters. We know, however, that varying
microscopic degrees of freedom can lead to different atomic structures without
changing the macroscopic parameters. These structures can transition into each
other and are called complexions. Here, we investigate $[11\overline{1}]$
symmetric tilt boundaries in fcc metals, where two complexions -- dubbed domino
and pearl -- were observed before. We compare these two complexions for two
different misorientations: In $\Sigma19$b $[11\overline{1}]$ $(178)$
boundaries, both complexions exhibit the same disconnection mode. The critical
stress for nucleation and propagation of disconnections is nevertheless
different for domino and pearl. At low temperatures, the Peierls-like barrier
for disconnection propagation dominates, while at higher temperatures the
nucleation is the limiting factor. For $\Sigma$7 $[11\overline{1}]$ $(145)$
boundaries, we observed a larger difference. The domino and pearl complexions
migrate in different directions under the same boundary conditions. While both
migration directions are possible crystallographically, an analysis of the
complexions' structural motifs and the disconnection core structures reveals
that the choice of disconnection mode and therefore migration direction is
directly due to the atomic structure of the grain boundary.

<h3>Real-space topological invariant for time-quasiperiodic Majoranas</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13129" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13129</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zihao Qi, Ilyoun Na, Gil Refael, Yang Peng</i>
<p>When subjected to quasiperiodic driving protocols, superconducting systems
have been found to harbor robust time-quasiperiodic Majorana modes, extending
the concept beyond static and Floquet systems. However, the presence of
incommensurate driving frequencies results in dense energy spectra, rendering
conventional methods of defining topological invariants based on band structure
inadequate. In this work, we introduce a real-space topological invariant
capable of identifying time-quasiperiodic Majoranas by leveraging the system's
spectral localizer, which integrates information from both Hamiltonian and
position operators. Drawing insights from non-Hermitian physics, we establish
criteria for constructing the localizer and elucidate the robustness of this
invariant in the presence of dense spectra. Our numerical simulations, focusing
on a Kitaev chain driven by two incommensurate frequencies, validate the
efficacy of our approach.

<p>Existence of quasi-static negative capacitance (QSNC) was proposed from an
interpretation of the widely accepted Landau model of ferroelectrics. However,
many works showed not to support the QSNC theory, making it controversial. In

transition-state-theory, can connect various models including first-principles,
Landau, Preisach and nucleation limited switching while it does not predict the
existence of QSNC.

<h3>Sub-Sharvin conductance and incoherent shot-noise in graphene disks at  magnetic field</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13141</a>
<br>
</p><i>Adam Rycerz, Katarzyna Rycerz, Piotr Witkowski</i>
<p>Highly-doped graphene samples show the conductance reduced and the shot-noise
power enhanced compared to standard ballistic systems in two-dimensional
electron gas. These features can be understood within a model assuming
incoherent scattering of Dirac electrons between two interfaces separating the
sample and the leads. Here we find, by adopting the above-mentioned model for
the edge-free (Corbino) geometry and by means of the computer simulation of
quantum transport, that another graphene-specific feature should be observable
when the current flow through a doped disk is blocked by high magnetic field.
In case the conductance drops to zero, the Fano factor approaches the value of
$F\approx{}0.56$, with a very weak dependence on the disk radii ratio. The role
of finite source-drain voltages and the system behavior upon tuning the
electrostatic potential barrier from a rectangular to parabolic shape are also
discussed.

<h3>Observation of Momentum Space Josephson Effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13151</a>
<br>
</p><i>Annesh Mukhopadhyay, Xi-Wang Luo, Colby Schimelfenig, M. K. H. Ome, Sean Mossman, Chuanwei Zhang, Peter Engels</i>
<p>The momentum space Josephson effect describes the supercurrent flow between
weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at two discrete momentum
states. Here, we experimentally observe this exotic phenomenon using a BEC with
Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, where the tunneling between two local band
minima is implemented by the momentum kick of an additional optical lattice. A
sudden quench of the Raman detuning induces coherent spin-momentum oscillations
of the BEC, which is analogous to the a.c. Josephson effect. We observe both
plasma and regular Josephson oscillations in different parameter regimes. The
experimental results agree well with the theoretical model and numerical
simulation, and showcase the important role of nonlinear interactions. We also
show that the measurement of the Josephson plasma frequency gives the
Bogoliubov zero quasimomentum gap, which determines the mass of the
corresponding pseudo-Goldstone mode, a long-sought phenomenon in particle
physics. The observation of momentum space Josephson physics offers an exciting
platform for quantum simulation and sensing utilizing momentum states as a
synthetic degree.

<p>Intensities in high-resolution phase-contrast images from electron
microscopes build up discretely in time by detecting single electrons. A wave
description of pulse-like coherent-inelastic interaction of an electron with
matter is detailed and verified. In perspective, the interaction time of any
matter wave compares with the lifetime of a virtual particle of any elemental
interaction, suggesting the present concept of coherent-inelastic interactions
of matter waves might be generalizable.

<h3>Effects of dynamical dielectric screening on the excitonic spectrum of  monolayer semiconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13162</a>
<br>
</p><i>Dinh Van Tuan, Hanan Dery</i>
<p>We present a new method to solve the dynamical Bethe-Salpeter Equation
numerically. The method allows one to investigate the effects of dynamical
dielectric screening on the spectral position of excitons in transition-metal
dichalcogenide monolayers. The dynamics accounts for the response of optical
phonons in the materials below and on top the monolayer to the electric field
lines between the electron and hole of the exciton. The inclusion of this
effect unravels the origin of a counterintuitive energy blueshift of the
exciton resonance, observed recently in monolayer semiconductors that are
supported on ionic crystals with large dielectric constants. A surprising
result is that while energy renormalization of a free electron in the
conduction band or a free hole in the valence band is controlled by the
low-frequency dielectric constant, the bandgap energy introduces a phase
between the photoexcited electron and hole, rendering contributions from the
high-frequency dielectric constant also important when evaluating self-energies
of the exciton components. As a result, bandgap renormalization of the exciton
is not the sum of independent contributions from energy shifts of the
conduction and valence bands. The theory correctly predicts the energy shifts
of exciton resonances in various dielectric environments that embed
two-dimensional semiconductors.

<h3>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi  high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</a>
<br>
</p><i>Christopher D. Woodgate, George A. Marchant, Livia B. Pártay, Julie B. Staunton</i>
<p>We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our
approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the
paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker
formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential
approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear
response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In
addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for
study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the
nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential
energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of
Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or
$\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other
hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental
observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the
melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms
directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are
dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe
remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling
suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases.
These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering
tendencies in these intriguing materials.

<p>A system that possesses translational symmetry but breaks orientational
symmetry is known as a nematic phase. While there are many examples of nematic
phases in a wide range of contexts, such as in liquid crystals, complex oxides,
and superconductors, of particular interest is the magnetic analogue, where the
spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom of the electron are intertwined.
The difficulty of spin nematics is the unambiguous realization and
characterization of the phase. Here we present an entirely new type of magnetic
nematic phase, which replaces the basis of individual spins with magnetic
helices. The helical basis allows for the direct measurement of the order
parameters with soft X-ray scattering and a thorough characterization of the
nematic phase and its thermodynamic transitions. We discover two distinct
nematic phases with unique spatio-temporal correlation signatures. Using
coherent X-ray methods, we find that near the phase boundary between the two
nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on the timescale of both seconds and
sub-nanoseconds. Additionally, we have determined that the fluctuations occur
simultaneously with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating that
there is spontaneous symmetry breaking and new degrees of freedom become
available. Our results provide a novel framework for characterizing exotic
phases and the phenomena presented can be mapped onto a broad class of physical
systems.

<h3>Nanomechanical ancilla qubits generator for error correction algorithms  in quantum computation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Danko Radić, Leonid Y. Gorelik, Sergei I. Kulinich, Robert I. Shekhter</i>
<p>We suggest a nanoelectromechanical setup that generates properly entangled
ancillary ("ancilla") qubits for error correction algorithms in quantum
computing, demonstrated as an encoder for the three-qubit bit flip code. The
setup is based on mesoscopic terminal utilizing the AC Josephson effect between
voltage biased superconducting electrodes and mechanically vibrating mesoscopic
superconducting grain in the regime of the Cooper pair box, controlled by the
gate voltage. Required functionality is achieved by specifically tailored
time-protocol of operating two external parameters: bias voltage and gate
voltage. The superconducting grain is fixed on the free end of a cantilever,
performing controlled in-plane mechanical vibrations, generating the
nanomechanical coherent states organised in a pair of entangled cat-states in
two perpendicular spatial directions. Cooper pair box and nanomechanical
coherent states become three entangled qubits in a particular way: quantum
information, initially encoded in superposition of the Cooper pair box states,
is transduced into quantum superposition of two special 3-qubit entangled
states, $\vert \uparrow + \, + \rangle$ and $\vert \downarrow - \, - \rangle$.
It constitutes the basic input state for the three-qubit bit flip code, used in
quantum computation mainly for error correction, "installed" on a single
physical object in which the last two ancilla qubits are generated by the
nanoelectromechanical setup.

<p>Monolayers of ReS2 were grown by a chemical vapor deposition technique on
SiO2/Si substrates and investigated at room temperature by using micro-Raman,
micro-photoluminescence (PL) and absorbance spectroscopies. The Raman
scattering spectrum exhibits several phonon modes that were confirmed by the
computation analysis based on the density functional theory. The ReS2
structural integrity was confirmed by using the XRD and the energy dispersion
spectroscopy that was obtained by the scanning electron microscopy.
Photoluminescence spectra show excitons related to interband transition in thin
monolayer flakes and bulk-like structures. Additionally, a sharp PL line
located at 1.2620 eV with a second harmonic peak at 2.5420 eV were observed and
explained in terms of interband excitonic transitions originated within the
rhenium 5d orbit. An optical absorbance spectrum with an exciton peak around
1.4660 eV was obtained for an assembly of ReS2 flakes grown on silica
substrate.

<h3>Effect of disorder on Berry curvature and quantum metric in two-band  gapped graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13275</a>

</p><i>Ze Liu, Zhi-Fan Zhang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</i>
<p>The geometric properties of parameter space are mostly described by Berry
curvature and quantum metric, which is the imaginary and real part of quantum
geometric tensor, respectively. In this work, we calculate the dressed Berry
curvature and quantum metric containing eight Feynman diagrams, which is
proportional to the leading-order of the concentration of impurities. For a
two-band gapped graphene model, we find the disorder does not break the
original symmetry of Berry curvature and quantum metric but decrease (increase)
the absolute value of conductor (valence) band. We show how impurities affect
the Berry curvature and quantum metric, laying the foundation for the study of
the influence of impurities on the electron transport properties.

<p>Bismuth produces different types of ordered superstructures on the InAs(100)
surface, depending on the growth procedure and coverage. The (2x1) phase forms
at completion of a Bi monolayer and consists of a uniformly oriented array of
parallel lines of Bi dimers. Scanning tunneling and core level spectroscopies
demonstrate its metallic character, in contrast with the semiconducting
properties expected on the basis of the electron counting principle. The weak
electronic coupling among neighboring lines gives rise to quasi one-dimensional
Bi-derived bands with open contours at the Fermi level. Spin- and
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a giant Rashba splitting of
these bands, in good agreement with ab-initio electronic structure
calculations. The very high density of the dimer lines, the metallic and quasi
one-dimensional band dispersion and the Rashba-like spin texture make the
Bi/InAs(100)-(2x1) phase an intriguing system, where novel transport regimes
can be studied.

<h3>Domain wall migration-mediated ferroelectric switching and Rashba effect  tuning in GeTe thin films</h3>

<p>Germanium Telluride (GeTe), identified as a ferroelectric Rashba
semiconductor, is a promising candidate for future electronic devices in
computing and memory applications. However, its ferroelectric switching on a
microscopic scale remains to be understood. Here, we propose that the migration
of a domain wall can be the mechanism that mediates the ferroelectric
switching. By employing $ab~initio$ methods, such a mechanism is characterized
by an energy barrier of $66.8$ meV/nm$^2$, in a suitable range for retention
and switchability. In accompanying the domain wall migration, the net Rashba
effect is tunable, as it is a result of competition between layers with
opposite electric polarization. These results shed light on the ferroelectric
switching mechanism in GeTe, paving stones for the design of potential
GeTe-based devices.

<h3>Chern Number Tunable Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Compensated  Antiferromagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13305" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13305</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wenhao Liang, Jiaqi An, Zeyu Li, Yafei Ren, Zhenhua Qiao, Qian Niu</i>
<p>We propose to realize quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional
antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We consider antiferromagnetic
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a concrete example. In contrast to the even-layer A-type
antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ that has zero Chern number due to the combined
parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, the system can host a nonzero Chern
number by breaking this symmetry. We show that by controlling the
antiferromagnetic spin configuration, for example, down/up/up/down, to break
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, tetralayer antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ can
realize QAHE with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$. Such spin configuration can be
stablized by pinning the spin orientations on top and bottom layers.
Furthermore, we reveal that the edge states are layer-selective and primarily
locate at the boundaries of the bottom and top layers. In addition, via tuning
the on-site orbital energy which determines the inverted band gap, we find
tunable Chern number from $\mathcal{C}=-1$ to $\mathcal{C}=2$ and then to
$\mathcal{C}=-1$. Our work not only proposes a scheme to realize Chern number
tunable QAHE in antiferromagnets without net spin magnetization, but also
provide a platform for layer-selective dissipationless transport devices.

<p>We discuss the stochastic process of creation and annihilation of particles,
i.e., the $A^{n} \rightleftarrows B$ process in which $n$ particles $A$s and
one particle $B$ are transformed to each other. Considering the case that the
stochastic fluctuations are dependent on the numbers of $A$ and $B$, we apply
the Langevin equation for the stochastic time-evolution of the numbers of $A$
and $B$. We analyze the Langevin equation in the path-integral formalism, and
show that the new driving force is generated dynamically by the stochastic
fluctuations. We present that the generated driving force leads to the
nontrivial stable equilibrium state. This equilibrium state is regarded as the
new state of order which is induced effectively by stochastic fluctuations. We
also discuss that the formation of such equilibrium state requires at least two
stochastic variables in the stochastic processes.

Waals materials, like Vanadium based dichalcogenides, VX$_2$ (X=S, Se, Te) and
other materials of similar symmetry. We assume that the materials exhibit
Dzialoshinskii- Moriya interaction and in-plane easy-axis magnetic anisotropy
due to symmetry breaking induced externally (eg, by strain, gate voltage,
proximity effects to an appropriate substrate/oberlayer, etc). The
considerations are limited to a collinear spin ground state, stabilized by a
sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The theoretical analysis is
performed within the general spin wave theory based on the
Hollstein-Primakoff-Bogolubov transformation.

<h3>3D characterization of kinematic fields and poroelastic swelling near  the tip of a propagating crack in a hydrogel</h3>

<p>In fracture mechanics, polyacrylamide hydrogels have been widely used as a
model material for experiments, benefited from its optical transparency,
fracture brittleness, and low Rayleigh wave velocity. To describe the brittle
fracture in the hydrogels, linear elastic fracture mechanics comes as the first
choice. However, in soft materials such as hydrogels, the crack opening can be
extremely large, leading to substantial geometric nonlinearity and material
nonlinearity at the crack tip. Furthermore, poroelasticity may also modify the
local mechanical state within the polymer network. Direct characterization of
the kinematic fields and poroelastic effect at the crack tip is lacking. Here,
based on a hybrid method of digital image correlation and particle tracking
technique, we retrieved high-resolution 3D particle trajectories near the tip
of a slowly propagating crack and measured the near-tip 3D kinematic fields,
including the displacement fields, rotation fields, stretch fields, and
swelling fields. Results confirmed the complex multi-axial stretching near the
crack tip and the substantial geometric nonlinearity, particularly on the two
wakes of the crack where rotation exceeds 30$^{\deg}$. Significant swelling,
due to the poroelastic solvent migration, is also observed, with a strong
correlation to the local stretch. Our experimental method, without any
assumption of the material properties, can be readily extended to study 3D
crack tips in a huge varieties of materials, and our results can shed light on
the fundamental fracture mechanics and the development of material models for
soft materials undergoing large multi-axial loading and substantial swelling.

<p>Graphene corrugations affect hybridization of $\pi$ and $\sigma$ orbitals of
carbon atoms in graphene based systems. It can as well break differently the
symmetry of the electron transfer integrals for different strip boundaries.
Using these facts, we found that the momentum distribution of electrons in
ballistically propagating beam can be selective without external electric
and/or magnetic fields in the graphene strip under experimentally feasible
periodic potential. Such a potential is created by means of the superlattice
that consists of periodically repeated graphene elements (flat+rippled
junction) with different hybridization of carbon orbits, produced by variation
of the graphene surface curvature. As a result it gives rise to the valley
dependent focusing effects that can be controlled by alteration of number of
superlattice elements.

</p><i>Chelsea Fox, Kyle Chen, Micaela Antonini, Tommaso Magrini, Chiara Daraio</i>
<p>As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular
structures that lead to outstanding mechanical properties, like high
stiffness-to-weight ratios and good energy absorption. To reproduce these
properties in synthetic materials, biomimicry typically replicates the
irregular natural structure, often leading to fabrication challenges. Here, we
present a bioinspired material design method that instead reduces the irregular
natural structure to a finite set of building blocks, also known as tiles, and
rules to connect them, and then uses these elements as instructions to generate
synthetic materials with mechanical properties similar to the biological
materials. We demonstrate the method using the pericarp of the orange, a member
of the citrus family known for its protective, energy-absorbing capabilities.
We generate polymer samples and characterize them under quasi-static and
dynamic compression and observe spatially-varying stiffness and good energy
absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and
connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, we determine how to
spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.

<h3>Persistent and anti-Persistent Motion in Bounded and Unbounded Space:  Resolution of the First-Passage Problem</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13360" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13360</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daniel Marris, Luca Giuggioli</i>
<p>The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a
widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The
ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic
systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated
movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been
made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related
quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or
multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap
we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities
to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice
for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step
non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and
unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and
anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice.
The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to
that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target
from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to
spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either
repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics
to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with
the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not.
With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage
distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the
latter.

<p>A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) formed on a curved surface with a distinct
topology has been a hot topic of intense research, in search of new phenomena
in quantum physics as well as for its possible application in quantum
computing. In addition to the study of a spherical-shell-shaped BEC, we studied
the formation of a cylindrical-shell-shaped harmonically-trapped dipolar BEC of
$^{164}$Dy atoms theoretically using an improved mean-field model including a
Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density.
To test the robustness of the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC, here we study its
expansion in the same model. We find that as the harmonic trap in the $x$ and
$y$ directions are removed, maintaining the axial trap, the
cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC expands in the $x$-$y$ plane without deformation,
maintaining its shell-shaped structure. After an adequate radial expansion, the
axial trap can be relaxed for a desired axial expansion of the
cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC allowing its observation.

</p><i>Gan Ren</i>
<p>The Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relation is proposed to be breakdown in
supercooled liquids by many studies. However, the conclusions are usually drawn
by testing some variants of the SED relation rather than its original form. In
this work, the rationality of the SED relation and its variants is examined by
performing molecular dynamics simulations with the Lewis-Wahnstrom model of
ortho-terphenyl (OTP). The results indicate the original SED relation is valid
for OTP but the three variants are all breakdown. The inconsistency between SED
relation and its variants is attributed to the adopted assumptions and
approximations, heterogeneous dynamics and the interactions among molecules.
Therefore, care should be taken when employing its variants to judge the
validity of the SED relation in supercooled liquids.

<p>Chirality in solid-state materials has sparked significant interest due to
potential applications of topologically-protected chiral states in
next-generation information technology. The electrical magneto-chiral effect
(eMChE), arising from relativistic spin-orbit interactions, shows great promise
for developing chiral materials and devices for electronic integration. Here we
demonstrate an angle-resolved eMChE in an A-B-C-C type atomic-layer
superlattice lacking time and space inversion symmetry. We observe
non-superimposable enantiomers of left-handed and right-handed tilted uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy as the sample rotates under static fields, with the tilting
angle reaching a striking 45 degree. Magnetic force microscopy and atomistic
simulations correlate the tilt to the emergence and evolution of chiral spin
textures. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction lock effect in competition with
Zeeman effect is demonstrated to be responsible for the angle-resolved eMChE.
Our findings open up a new horizon for engineering angle-resolved
magneto-chiral anisotropy, shedding light on the development of novel
angle-resolved sensing or writing techniques in chiral spintronics.

<p>Understanding the structural and magnetic properties in layered hybrid
organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) is key for their design and
integration in spin-electronic devices. Here, we have conducted a systematic
study on ten compounds to understand the effect of the transition metal
(Cu$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$, Co$^{2+}$), organic spacer (alkyl- and aryl-ammonium)
and perovskite phase (Ruddlesden-Popper and Dion-Jacobson) on the properties of
these materials. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements show that the
crystals' structural phase transitions are triggered by the motional freedom of
the organic cations as well as by the flexibility of the inorganic metal-halide
lattice. In the case of Cu$^{2+}$ HOIPs, an increase of the in-plane anisotropy
and a reduction of the octahedra interlayer distance is found to change the
behavior of the HOIP from that of a 2D ferromagnet to that of a quasi-3D
antiferromagnet. Mn$^{2+}$ HOIPs show inherent antiferromagnetic octahedra
intralayer interactions and a phenomenologically rich magnetism, presenting
spin-canting, spin-flop transitions and metamagnetism controlled by the crystal
anisotropy. Co$^{2+}$ crystals with non-linked tetrahedra show a dominant
paramagnetic behavior irrespective of the organic spacer and the perovskite
phase. This work demonstrates that the chemical flexibility of HOIPs can be
exploited to develop novel layered magnetic materials with tailored magnetic
properties.

</p><i>Sota Nishiyama, Masayuki Ohzeki</i>
<p>The storage capacity of a binary classification model is the maximum number
of random input-output pairs per parameter that the model can learn. It is one
of the indicators of the expressive power of machine learning models and is
important for comparing the performance of various models. In this study, we
analyze the structure of the solution space and the storage capacity of fully
connected two-layer neural networks with general activation functions using the
replica method from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that the
storage capacity per parameter remains finite even with infinite width and that
the weights of the network exhibit negative correlations, leading to a
'division of labor'. In addition, we find that increasing the dataset size
triggers a phase transition at a certain transition point where the permutation
symmetry of weights is broken, resulting in the solution space splitting into
disjoint regions. We identify the dependence of this transition point and the
storage capacity on the choice of activation function. These findings
contribute to understanding the influence of activation functions and the
number of parameters on the structure of the solution space, potentially
offering insights for selecting appropriate architectures based on specific
objectives.

<p>Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the conventional spin Hall effect
and/or Rashba-Edelstein effect are promising for manipulating magnetization.
However, this approach typically exhibits non-deterministic and inefficient
behaviour when it comes to switching perpendicular ferromagnets. This
limitation posed a challenge for write-in operations in high-density magnetic
memory devices. Here, we determine an effective solution to overcome this
challenge by simultaneously leveraging both a planar Hall effect (PHE) and an
orbital Hall effect (OHE). Using a representative Co/PtGd/Mo trilayer SOT
device, we demonstrate that the PHE of Co is enhanced by the interfacial
coupling of Co/PtGd, giving rise to a finite out-of-plane damping-like torque
within the Co layer. Simultaneously, the OHE in Mo layer induces a strong
out-of-plane orbital current, significantly amplifying the in-plane
damping-like torque through orbital-to-spin conversion. While either the PHE or
OHE alone proves insufficient for reversing the perpendicular magnetization of
Co, their collaborative action enables high-efficiency field-free deterministic
switching. Our work provides a straightforward strategy to realize high-speed
and low-power spintronics.

</p><i>Jingtian Shi, Nicolás Morales-Durán, Eslam Khalaf, Allan H. MacDonald</i>
<p>Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been
identified in AA homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e
superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional
Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed
viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the
position-dependence of the layer spinor by a nonuniform periodic effective
magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field
cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band
version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as
Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we
critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the
parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the
adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including
those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation
leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible
beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term
in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy.
As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of
the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively
reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature
distribution.

<br>
</p><i>Subhrangsu Saha, John E. Dolbow, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</i>
<p>With the fundamental objective of establishing the universality of the
Griffith energy competition to describe the growth of large cracks in solids
\emph{not} just under monotonic but under general loading conditions, this
paper puts forth a generalization of the classical Griffith energy competition
in nominally elastic brittle materials to arbitrary \emph{non-monotonic}
quasistatic loading conditions, which include monotonic and cyclic loadings as
special cases. Centered around experimental observations, the idea consists in:
$i$) viewing the critical energy release rate $\mathcal{G}_c$ \emph{not} as a
material constant but rather as a material function of both space $\textbf{X}$
and time $t$, $ii$) one that decreases in value as the loading progresses, this
solely within a small region $\Omega_\ell(t)$ around crack fronts, with the
characteristic size $\ell$ of such a region being material specific, and $iii$)
with the decrease in value of $\mathcal{G}_c$ being dependent on the history of
the elastic fields in $\Omega_\ell(t)$. By construction, the proposed Griffith
formulation is able to describe any Paris-law behavior of the growth of large
cracks in nominally elastic brittle materials for the limiting case when the
loading is cyclic. For the opposite limiting case when the loading is
monotonic, the formulation reduces to the classical Griffith formulation.
Additional properties of the proposed formulation are illustrated via a
parametric analysis and direct comparisons with representative fatigue fracture
experiments on a ceramic, mortar, and PMMA.

</p><i>Yaokun Su, Chen Li</i>
<p>The study of phonon dynamics is pivotal for understanding material
properties, yet it faces challenges due to the irreversible information loss
inherent in powder inelastic neutron scattering spectra and the limitations of
traditional analysis methods. In this study, we present a machine learning
framework designed to reveal obscured phonon dynamics from powder spectra.
Using a variational autoencoder, we obtain a disentangled latent representation
of spectra and successfully extract force constants for reconstructing phonon
dispersions. Notably, our model demonstrates effective applicability to
experimental data even when trained exclusively on physics-based simulations.
The fine-tuning with experimental spectra further mitigates issues arising from
domain shift. Analysis of latent space underscores the model's versatility and
generalizability, affirming its suitability for complex system applications.
Furthermore, our framework's two-stage design is promising for developing a
universal pre-trained feature extractor. This approach has the potential to
revolutionize neutron measurements of phonon dynamics, offering researchers a
potent tool to decipher intricate spectra and gain valuable insights into the
intrinsic physics of materials.

<p>Multiferroicity allows magnetism to be controlled using electric fields or
vice versa, which has gained tremendous interest in both fundamental research
and device applications. A reduced dimensionality of multiferroic materials is
highly desired for device miniaturization, but the coexistence of
ferroelectricity and magnetism at the two-dimensional limit is still debated.
Here, we used a NbSe2 substrate to break both the C3 rotational and inversion
symmetries in monolayer VCl3 and thus introduced exceptional in-plane
ferroelectricity into a two-dimensional magnet. Scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their
domain boundaries in monolayer VCl3, where coexisting antiferromagnetic order
with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer
measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial
role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking
the symmetries and thus in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was
further verified by examining an ML-VCl3/graphene sample. Our work demonstrates
an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets
through van der Waals interfacial interactions.

discovered in monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$ via the observation of quantized
longitudinal conductance that rarely exists in other 2D topological insulators.
The non-trivial $Z_2$ topological charges can exist at both charge neutrality
point and the van Hove singularity point with correlation effect induced band
gap. Based on this model 2D material, we studied the switch of quantized
signals between longitudinal conductance and transversal Hall conductance via
tuning external magnetic field. In $Z_2$ topological phase of monolayer
$\text{TaIrTe}_4$, the zero Chern number can be understood as 1-1=0 from the
double band inversion from spin-up and spin-down channels. After applying a
magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, the Zeeman split changes the band
order for one branch of the band inversion from spin-up and spin-down channels,
along with a sign charge of the Berry phase. Then the net Chern number of 1-1=0
is tuned to 1+1=2 or -1-1=-2 depending on the orientation of the magnetic
field. The quantized signal not only provides another effective method for the
verification of topological state in monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$, but also
offers a strategy for the utilization of the new quantum topological states
based on switchable quantized responses.

<p>Pinch point is a spectral discontinuity found in the neutron diffraction
image of spin ice. Similar spectral singularity is commonly observed in a broad
range of systems that have a close connection with flat bands. We focus on the
electron flat band and its two topologically distinct classes of wavefunction:
the compact localized state (CLS), and the non-contractible loop state (NLS).
We establish their simple mathematical relationship, showing that different
Bloch NLSs can be derived as momentum derivatives of a Bloch CLS, depending on
the approaching direction toward the singular point. This CLS-NLS
correspondence helps visualize the pinch point as an interference pattern among
NLSs through a ``polarizer", which encodes the information about the location
of singular momentum and the experimental techniques like spin-polarized
photoemission spectroscopy. It helps extract topological information knit to
microscopic electronic and magnetic structures.

<p>Strain is an effective strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of
2D materials, but it has been almost unexplored in layered hybrid
organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) due to their complex band
structure and mechanical properties. Here, we investigate the
temperature-dependent microphotoluminescence (PL) of 2D
$(C_6H_5CH_2CH_2NH_3)_2Cs_3Pb_4Br_{13}$ HOIP subject to biaxial strain induced
by a $SiO_2$ ring platform on which flakes are placed by viscoelastic stamping.
At 80 K, we found that a strain of <1% can change the PL emission from a single
peak (unstrained) to three well-resolved peaks. Supported by micro-Raman
spectroscopy, we show that the thermomechanically generated strain modulates
the bandgap due to changes in the octahedral tilting and lattice expansion.
Mechanical simulations demonstrate the coexistence of tensile and compressive
strain along the flake. The observed PL peaks add an interesting feature to the
rich phenomenology of photoluminescence in 2D HOIPs, which can be exploited in
tailored sensing and optoelectronic devices.

<h3>A Variational Approach to Trap Macromolecules</h3>

<p>Trapping macromolecules is impoartant for the study of their conformations,
interactions, dynamics and kinetic processes. Here, we develop a variational
approach which self-consistently introduces a mean force that controls the
center-of-mass position and a self-adjustable harmonic potential that counters
the center-of-mass fluctuation. The effectiveness and versatility of our
approach is verified in three classical yet not fully understood problems in
polymer physics: (1) single-chain conformation in the entire solvent regimes,
(2) globule-pearl necklace-coil transition of a polyelectrolyte and (3)
inter-chain interaction by simultaneously trapping two polymers. The scaling
relationships and $\theta$ behaviors are well captured. Conformations with
large shape anisotropy appearing in charged polymers are clearly depicted. Our
theoretical predictions are in quantitative agreement with experimental results
reported in the literature.

<p>The emergence of strong relativistic spin-orbit effects in low-dimensional
systems provides a rich opportunity for exploring unconventional states of
matter. Here, we present a route to realize highly tunable relativistic band
structures based on the lateral patterning of proximity-induced spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). The concept is illustrated on a 1D patterned graphene
heterostructure, where the periodic spatial modulation of SOC is shown to give
rise to a rich mini-band structure with massless and massive Dirac bands
carrying large Berry curvature. The envisaged systems support robust spin Hall
responses driven by the quantum geometry of mini-bands, which can be tailored
through metasurface fabrication methods and twisting effects. These findings
suggest new pathways to 2D quantum material design and low-power spintronic
applications.

<h3>Structural modulation driven Curie temperature enhancement in Cr-doped  SrRuO3</h3>

<p>Strongly correlated system with competing ground states are often poised
close to the quantum critical point. External perturbations such as pressure,
strain, electric field, and chemical doping can stabilise its ground state with
exotic physical properties. Cr-doping is the lone exception which enhances the
Curie-temperature in one of such correlated system SrRuO$_3$. To find the
origin of $T_C$ enhancement, we investigate temperature-dependent structure,
spectroscopic, magnetic and magnetotransport properties in
SrRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$. Cr-doping squeezes the unit cell volume which
effectively enhances the stretching octahedral distortion by nearly five times
than pure SrRuO$_3$. The Curie temperature increment by $\sim$ 22 K for x =
0.15 is found to be intertwined with the structural-modulation.
Temperature-dependent Neutron diffraction analysis indicate that the unit cell
volume minima coincide exactly with the enhanced ferromagnetic ordering ($\sim$
190 K). Further analysis reveals that the effect of Cr-doping not only freezes
the octahedral tilt below 100 K but also suppresses the complex magnetism
responsible for exchange bias and topological hall effect in SrRuO$_3$. The
spectroscopic measurements find a reduction of itinerancy of d-electrons with
Cr-doping. The magnetotransport measurements portray an evolution from
itinerant to localised ferromagnetism.

<h3>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</h3>

<p>Fano resonance arises from interference between a direct path and a resonant
path. Predictions and observations of Fano profiles of conductance have been
reported yet only in nonchiral electron transport. We propose an electronic
Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer(\textcolor{blue}{MZFI}) that integrates a
quantum dot to an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer and investigate
various transport spectra of this type of device. Electron motion in the device
is chiral and backscattering is absent, enabling the transmission, linear
conductance and differential spectra such as differential conductance,
differential shot noise and differential Fano factor to possess perfect Fano
profiles that can be fully tuned by an external magnetic flux. For a symmetric
interferometer of(two arms with the same length, even the current and shot
noise demonstrate fully tunable resonances and are bestowed different hallmarks
unique to Fano resonances. All the transport spectra display the same evolution
pattern in an evolution cycle, which along with the profiles are robust against
variation of the parameters defining the device.

<p>The magnetism in the correlated metal CaRuO$_3$ is enigmatic as it is poised
near a triple point among the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and
paramagnetic ground states. Here we report a detailed work on structural,
spectroscopic, magnetic, and transport properties in CaRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$.
We find that Cr doping reduces the orthorhombicity in CaRuO$_3$. Surprisingly,
a tiny (x = 0.01) amount of Cr-doping drives the magnetic ground state from
\enquote{paramagnetic-like} to ferrimagnetic. Slightly higher Cr-doping (x =
0.05) results formation of magnetic clusters which gives rise to Griffiths
singularity and power law divergence in magnetic susceptibility. The magnetism
in CaRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ is explained in terms of \enquote{seven atom}
ferrimagnetic clusters. Electrical transport shows a gradual evolution of a
non-metallic state upon Cr-doping. In particular, for x $\geq$ 0.1, the
temperature-dependent resistivity follows Mott-VRH conduction. The XPS study
also supports significant role of disorder and electron correlation which
effectively reduces the itinerant character of electrons. Finally, a new T-x
phase diagram is constructed depicting the evolution of electronic and magnetic
state in CaRu$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$.

<p>Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive
exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the
infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron
mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the
visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures. In this study, we
showcase the successful realization of the phase of \c{hi}_3 borophene on
diverse substrates using aluminum-based chemical vapor deposition. Leveraging
first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength
cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of
this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic
to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental
findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane
hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for
pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly
through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting
heterostructures.

<h3>Uncertainty Assessment of Probabilistic Cellular Automata Simulations in  Microstructure Evolution</h3>

</p><i>Majid Seyed-Salehi</i>
<p>The probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) method is highlighted for its
relatively simple numerical algorithm and low computational cost in the
simulation of microstructural evolution. In this method, probabilistic state
change rules are implemented to compute the evolution of cell states at each
time step. The stochastic nature of this simulation method leads to
non-repeatable simulation results, introducing inherent uncertainty. In this
study, the uncertainty and dispersion in PCA simulations of microstructural
evolution were investigated. Hence, the probabilistic transformations of cell
states were meticulously considered at each time step, and discrete probability
distribution functions (dPDF) were introduced to analyze the frequency
distribution of simulation outcomes. To evaluate the performance of the
proposed dPDFs, cellular automaton models were developed with various numbers
of cells and distribution of transformation probabilities. Multiple iterations
of these simulations were conducted, and the validity of the presented
distribution functions was assessed through statistical analysis of the
simulations outcomes. Comparisons between PCA simulation results and
distribution functions demonstrate consistency, emphasizing the predictive
capability of the proposed models. Also, the effects of modeling parameters on
the uncertainty of simulation results in two and three-dimensional PCA modeling
were studied, introducing the coefficient of variation as a measure of
dispersion. Results indicate that increasing the number of boundary cells,
cellular resolution, and model size reduces uncertainty, enhancing the
repeatability of PCA simulation outcomes.

<p>In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic
systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems
by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the
irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting
stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which
guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to
thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with
non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic
variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further
establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we
establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.

<p>A clear understanding of chirality in spin-active electronic states is
discussed in order to address confusions about chiral effects recently

as a measure of chirality in this categorization, which can be clearly related
to the chiral density operator in the Dirac equation. We extend the concepts of
chirality not only to those of materials but also to those of physical fields,
and to material-field composites. Additionally, we illustrate specific examples
from physics and chemistry that demonstrate the process of acquiring chirality
through the combination of seemingly achiral degrees of freedom, which we term
the emergence of chirality. Interference among multiple chiralities exhibiting
phenomena specific to handedness is also discussed.

<p>One of the most effective methods to enhance the strength of aluminum alloys
involves modifying grain boundaries (GBs) through solute segregation. However,
the fundamental mechanisms of solute segregation and their impacts on material
properties remain elusive. In this study, we implemented highly efficient
hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MCMD) algorithms in the graphics
process units molecular dynamics (GPUMD) package. Using this efficient MCMD
approach combined with a general-purpose machine-learning-based neuroevolution
potential (NEP) for 16 elemental metals and their alloys, we simulated the
segregation of 15 solutes in polycrystalline Al. Our results elucidate the
segregation behavior and trends of 15 solutes in polycrystalline Al.
Additionally, we investigated the impact of solutes on the strength of
polycrystalline Al. The mechanisms underlying solute strengthening and
embrittlement were analyzed at the atomistic level, revealing the importance of
GB cohesion, as well as the nucleation and movement of Shockley dislocations,
in determining the material's strength. We anticipate that our developed
methods, along with our insights into solute segregation behavior in
polycrystalline Al, will be valuable for the design of Al alloys and other
multi-component materials, including medium-entropy materials, high-entropy
materials, and complex concentrated alloys.

<h3>Controlling quantum vortex dynamics and vortex-antivortex annihilation  in Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</h3>

<p>Superfluids with strong spatial modulation can be experimentally produced in
the area of cold atoms under the influence of optical lattices. Here we address
$^{87}$Rb bosons at T=0 K in a flat geometry under the influence of a periodic
potential with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The statics and dynamics of vortex
excitations are studied in the case of one dimensional (1D) and of two
dimensional (2D) optical lattices, as function of the intensity of the optical
lattice. We compute how the vortex energy depends on the position of its core
and the energy barrier that a vortex has to surmount in order to move in the
superfluid. The dynamics of a vortex dipole, a pair of vortices of opposite
chirality, differ profoundly from the case of a uniform superfluid. In the 1D
case, when parallel ridges of density are present, the dynamics depends on the
positions of the two vortices. If they are in the same channel between two
ridges, then the two vortices approach each other until they annihilate each
other in a short time. If the two vortices are in distinct channels the dipole
undergoes a rigid translation but with a velocity depending on the intensity of
the optical lattice and this translation velocity can even change sign with
respect to the case of the uniform superfluid. Superimposed on this translation
an oscillatory motion is also present. These oscillatory motions can be both
longitudinal, i.e. along the channel, as well as transverse. In all cases the
transverse motions are one-side, in the sense that the vortex core never
crosses the equilibrium position nearest the starting position. In the case of
the 2D lattices we study (square, triangular and honeycomb), the two vortices
of a dipole move mainly by jumps between equilibrium positions and approach
each other until annihilation.

<p>Phonon polaritons (PhPs) are hybrid photon-phonon waves which enable strong
light-matter interactions and subdiffractional confinement, potentially
empowering applications in sensing, nonlinear optics and nanoscale energy

coupling between bulk phonon modes and localized surface phonon polariton
(SPhP) modes in indium phosphide (InP) nanopillars and 4H-silicon carbide
(4H-SiC) gratings. The Raman intensity within the nanostructures is described
in terms of the SPhP eigenmodes and used to reconstruct the field intensity,
providing a method to map SPhP eigenmodes using visible and near-IR light. Our
results indicate that, contrary to expectation, all Raman-active bulk phonon
modes of InP and 4H-SiC couple to the localized SPhP modes. Further, we confirm
that polarizability selection rules form the predominant coupling mechanism
between phonons and SPhP modes, with electron-phonon coupling playing a role
for certain phonon modes (A1(LO) and E1(TO) in 4H-SiC). These observations
provide a method for extending Raman studies of PhP modes to achieve full 3D
reconstruction of the PhP eigenmodes and visualize light-matter interactions
within nanostructures, thus advancing Raman scattering as a technique for
understanding PhP modes.

<p>In the recent rapid progress of quantum technology, controlling quantum
states has become an important subject of study. Of particular interest is the
control of open quantum systems, where the system of interest couples to the
environment in an essential way. One formalism to describe open systems is the
non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Photonics systems have been a major platform
to study non-Hermitian quantum mechanics due to its flexibility in engineering
gain and loss. Ultracold atomic gases have also used to study non-Hermitian
quantum mechanics. However, unlike in photonics, gain is not easily
controllable in ultracold atomic gases, and exploration of non-Hermitian
physics has been limited to control of losses. In this paper, we report
engineering of effective gain through evaporative cooling of judiciously chosen
initial thermal atoms. We observe resulting formation of Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) in excited eigenstates of a synthetic lattice. We realize
formation of BEC in a topological edge state of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
lattice in the synthetic hyperfine lattice, which can be regarded as atomic
laser oscillations at a topological edge mode, i.e. topological atom laser.

<p>In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is
magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase
supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of
transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a
PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The
dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems,
which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic
Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate
boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar
condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV
exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably
long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of
axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.

<p>We investigate the ground state magnetic configurations of a Fibonacci chain
of classical spins with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and monoaxial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions. Our analysis reveals a diverse
array of magnetic textures induced by an external magnetic field perpendicular
to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector. These textures exhibit a spectrum ranging
from a quasi-fully polarized non-collinear state under high magnetic fields,
capable of maintaining metastable chiral soliton topological defects, to a
variety of quasicrystalline chiral soliton lattices below a critical field
$H_c$. For a range of magnetic fields below $H_c$, the ground state spin
textures result from the interplay between an effective quasiperiodic potential
influencing the solitons and their repulsive interactions. At lower magnetic
fields, the system experiences a commensurate-incommensurate transition,
signified by the appearance of discommensurations in the quasicrystalline
soliton lattice. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the ground state
assumes a helical configuration with a quasiperiodic pitch angle.

<p>We study Thouless pumping and arresting of gap solitons in a two-component
Bose gas loaded into an optical superlattice. We show that, depending on the
atomic interactions and chemical potentials, the two solitons can be
simultaneously pumped or trapped, but we also identify regimes where one
soliton is pumped and the other arrested. These behaviors can be understood by
considering an effective model of the system based on a variational approach,
which reveals that the soliton width is a suitable qualifier for the observed
behaviours: solitons with a larger width get transported, while solitons with a
smaller width get trapped. Since these width can be controlled by tuning
interactions, it should be possible to observe all behaviours experimentally.

field as a non-conservational driving force acting on the Brownian particle.
This allows us to apply the theoretical formalism developed in a recent work
for general non-conservative Langevin dynamics. We define heat and work both at
the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and prove the second law of
thermodynamics explicitly. The entropy production (EP) is decomposed into a
housekeeping part and an excess part, both of which are non-negative at the
ensemble level. Fluctuation theorems are derived for the housekeeping work, the
excess work, and the total work, which are further verified using numerical
simulations. A comparison between our theory and an earlier theory by Speck et.

centrosymmetric helimagnet {\alpha}-EuP$_3$. The magnetic structure of
{\alpha}-EuP$_3$ is highly tunable by a magnetic field and closely coupled to
its semi-metallic electronic band structure, enabling a systematic study across
chiral and achiral magnetic phases on the correspondence between nonreciprocal
transport and electronic band asymmetry. Our findings reveal how a microscopic
change in the magnetic configuration of charge carriers can lead to
nonreciprocal electronic transport, paving the way for designing chiral magnets

</p><i>Jiyeon Kim, Donggeon Lee, Dongwoo Lee, Xin Li, Yea-Lee Lee, Sooran Kim</i>
<p>Recently, machine-learning approaches have accelerated computational
materials design and the search for advanced solid electrolytes. However, the
predictors are currently limited to static structural parameters, which may not
fully account for the dynamic nature of ionic transport. In this study, we
meticulously curated features considering dynamic properties and developed
machine-learning models to predict the ionic conductivity of solid
electrolytes. We compiled 14 phonon-related descriptors from first-principles
phonon calculations along with 16 descriptors related to structure and
electronic properties. Our logistic regression classifiers exhibit an accuracy
of 93 %, while the random forest regression model yields a root mean square
error of 1.179 S/cm and $R^2$ of 0.710. Notably, phonon-related features are
essential for estimating the ionic conductivity in both models. Furthermore, we
applied our prediction model to screen 264 Li-containing materials and
identified 11 promising candidates as potential superionic conductors.

<h3>Extract Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy in a Single Quantum Monte  Carlo Simulation</h3>

<p>The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE)
are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical
points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent
developments of stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many body systems,
we develop a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE
with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the
subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between
the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and corner
entanglement boundaries in \textit{a single} quantum Monte Carlo simulation.
Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but
also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the
universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE. Utilizing this
advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on
both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different
corner opening angles and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding
universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further
theoretical investigations in this field.

<h3>Spin Wave Optics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kirill A. Rivkin</i>
<p>Similarity between Walker and Helmholtz equations encouraged many to search
for analogies between optical and spin wave phenomena. In the present article
we demonstrate that one to one relationship can be established by formalizing
the concept of magnetic refractive index and deriving on its basis Eikonal
equations for magnetic media, formally proving that a very substantial portion
of optical devices: lenses, mirrors, waveguides and so on, can be implemented
as magnetic devices operating on spin waves instead of optical radiation.
Controlling the refractive index is accomplished by changing the environmental
variables such as magnetic bias field or temperature. Functionality of the
above mentioned devices is confirmed with micromagnetic simulations, which also
demonstrate a substantial agreement with the analytical model introduced in the
present manuscript.

<br>
</p><i>Leo Sementilli, Daniil M. Lukin, Hope Lee, Erick Romero, Jelena Vučković, Warwick P. Bowen</i>
<p>Due to their low mass and long coherence times, nanomechanical resonators
have many applications, from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum
interfaces. In many instances the performance is limited by internal material
damping. Crystalline materials promise lower material dissipation, however due
to fabrication challenges, amorphous materials are more commonly utilized.
Crystalline silicon carbide (SiC) is particularly appealing due to its
exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but to-date exhibits
higher nanomechanical dissipation than both amorphous and other crystalline
materials. To address this, we fabricate nanomechanical resonators thinned from
bulk monocrystalline 4H-SiC. Characterization of multiple resonators of
different sizes and thicknesses, allows us to discern the surface and
volumetric contributions to dissipation. We measure mechanical dissipation
rates as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any
previous crystalline SiC resonator, yielding quality factors as high as 20
million at room temperature. We also quantify the nonlinear dissipation of SiC
nanomechanical resonators for the first time, finding that it is lower than
other materials. This promises higher sensitivity in applications such as mass
sensing. By achieving exceptionally low dissipation in SiC resonators, our work
provides a path towards improved performance in sensing and other applications.

<h3>Residual Entropy of Hexagonal Ice and Cubic Ice: A Transfer Matrix  Description</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13897" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13897</a>
<br>
</p><i>De-Zhang Li, Yu-Jie Cen, Xin Wang, Xiao-Bao Yang</i>
<p>Residual entropy of ice systems has long been a significant and intriguing
issue in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. The exact
solutions for the residual entropy of realistic three-dimensional ice systems
remain unknown. In this study, we focus on two typical realistic ice systems,
namely the hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic). We present a transfer
matrix description of the number of ice-ruled configurations for these two
systems. First, a transfer matrix M is constructed for ice Ic, where each
element is the number of ice-ruled configurations of a hexagonal monolayer
under certain condition. The product of M and its transpose corresponds to a
bilayer unit in ice Ih lattice, therefore is exactly a transfer matrix for ice
Ih. Making use of this, we simply show that the residual entropy of ice Ih is
not less than that of ice Ic in the thermodynamic limit, which was first proved
by Onsager in 1960s. Furthermore, we find an alternative transfer matrix M' for
ice Ih, which is based on a monolayer periodic unit. Some interesting
properties of M, MMT and M' are illustrated, specifically the summation of all
elements, the element in the first row and first column, and the trace. Each
property is equivalent with the residual entropy of a two-dimensional ice
model. Our work rediscovers the relationship between the residual entropies of
ice Ih and ice Ic, and provides an effective description for various
two-dimensional ice models.

<h3>Using Polyvinyl Alcohol as Polymeric Adhesive to Enhance the Water  Stability of Soil and its Performance</h3>

</p><i>Chunyan Cao, Lingyu Zhao, Gang Li</i>
<p>Soil degradation threatens agricultural productivity and food supply, leading
to hunger issues in some developing regions. To address this challenge, we
developed a low-cost, highly efficient, and long-term stable soil improvement
method. We chose polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a commercially available polymer that
is safe and non-degradable, to serve as a soil adhesive. We mixed PVA solution
into the soil and applied a drying treatment to enhance the bonding between PVA
and the soil, achieving highly water-stable soil. This PVA-stabilized soil
exhibits low bulk density, high porosity, and high permeability, making it an
ideal substrate for planting. In a germination test, the PVA-stabilized soil
revealed a higher germination rate and growth rate compared to those of the
non-treated soil. We believe this simple and efficient soil improvement method
can restore degraded soil and contribute to sustainable agriculture.

<h3>Chiral edge plasmons in quantum anomalous Hall insulators</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Furu Zhang, Chenxi Ding, Jianhui Zhou, Yugui Yao</i>
<p>We find that the Berry curvature splits the edge plasmons propagating along
the opposite directions in quantum anomalous Hall insulators even with
vanishing Chern number. When the bulk is insulating, only one unidirectional
edge plasmon mode survives whose direction can be changed by external fields.
The unidirectional edge plasmon in the long-wavelength limit is acoustic and
essentially determined by the anomalous Hall conductivity. The group velocity
of the chiral edge plasmon would change its sign for a large wave vector, which
originates from the k-quadratic correction to the effective mass. The impacts
of the Fermi level and the wave vector on the bulk and edge plasmons are
discussed. Our work provides a well quantitative explanation of the recent
observation of the chiral edge plasmon in quantum anomalous Hall insulators and
some insight into the application of realistic topological materials in chiral
plasmonics.

<h3>Extreme Elastic Deformation of Atoms and Pressure-Induced  Superconductivity in Silicon</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13932" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13932</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xiaozhi Hu</i>
<p>Change in the interatomic spacing of a two-atom system under tension and
compression has been modelled by the elastic deformation of atoms. The critical
elastic strain of atoms before separation or cracking from tension was
estimated by the Griffith theory together with a recent mechanics model, then
extended to the lateral elastic expansion under uniaxial compression. The
hypothesis of deformable atoms has led to astonishing predictions of the
critical elastic strain, around 10 and 20 percent for silicon in the 110 and
100 crystal directions. Superimposed by the substantial reduction of
interatomic spacing in the direction of uniaxial compression above 20 GPa,
these severely deformed silicon atoms or metastable new variants have acquired
unforeseeable characteristics and properties, vastly different from those of
silicon atoms under moderate stresses. Under extreme pressure, the natural
repulsive reaction of atoms is intensified due to the increasing alignment of
electron orbitals along the pressure direction and formation of metastable
pressure-resistant phases. An opportunity for creation of a superconductive
band has thus arisen at the edge of the laterally elastically expanded region
away from the nuclei, where more space is available for free electron movement.
Diamond results were also used to validate the new mechanics model, including
the effects of atomic scale defects on fracture strain and strength, critical
to elastic strain engineering.

<p>We develop an accurate nanoelectronic modeling approach for realistic
three-dimensional topological insulator nanostructures and investigate their
low-energy surface-state spectrum. Starting from the commonly considered
four-band $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{k\cdot p}}$ bulk model Hamiltonian for the
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family of topological insulators, we derive new parameter sets for
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We consider a fitting strategy
applied to \emph{ab initio} band structures around the $\Gamma$ point that
ensures a quantitatively accurate description of the low-energy bulk and
surface states, while avoiding the appearance of unphysical low-energy states
at higher momenta, something that is not guaranteed by the commonly considered
perturbative approach. We analyze the effects that arise in the low-energy
spectrum of topological surface states due to band anisotropy and electron-hole
asymmetry, yielding Dirac surface states that naturally localize on different
side facets. In the thin-film limit, when surface states hybridize through the
bulk, we resort to a thin-film model and derive thickness-dependent model
parameters from \emph{ab initio} calculations that show good agreement with
experimentally resolved band structures, unlike the bulk model that neglects
relevant many-body effects in this regime. Our versatile modeling approach
offers a reliable starting point for accurate simulations of realistic
topological material-based nanoelectronic devices.

<p>At ambient pressure, HfTe$_{5}$ is a material at the boundary between a weak
and a strong topological phase, which can be tuned by changes in its
crystalline structure or by the application of high magnetic fields. It
exhibits a Lifshitz transition upon cooling, and three-dimensional (3D) quantum
Hall effect (QHE) plateaus can be observed at low temperatures. Here, we have
investigated the electrical transport properties of HfTe$_{5}$ under
hydrostatic pressure up to 3 GPa. We find a pressure-induced crossover from a
semimetallic phase at low pressures to an insulating phase at about 1.5 GPa.
Our data suggest the presence of a pressure-induced Lifshitz transition at low
temperatures within the insulating phase around 2 GPa. The quasi-3D QHE is
confined to the low-pressure region in the semimetallic phase. This reveals the
importance of the semimetallic groundstate for the emergence of the QHE in
HfTe$_{5}$ and thus favors a scenario based on a low carrier density metal in
the quantum limit for the observed signatures of the quasi-quantized 3D QHE.

<p>We extend the scattering theory of the Josephson effect to include a coupling
of the Josephson junction to a gapless electron reservoir in the normal state.
By opening up the system with a quasiparticle escape rate $1/\tau$, the
supercurrent carried at zero temperature by an Andreev level at energy
$\varepsilon_{\rm A}$ is reduced by a factor $(2/\pi)\arctan(2\varepsilon_{\rm

junctions", by comparing this result to different proposed generalizations of
the Josephson effect to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

<h3>Current fluctuations in finite-sized one-dimensional non-interacting  passive and active systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Arup Biswas, Stephy Jose, Arnab Pal, Kabir Ramola</i>
<p>We investigate the problem of effusion of particles initially confined in a
finite one-dimensional box of size $L$. We study both passive as well active
scenarios, involving non-interacting diffusive particles and run-and-tumble
particles, respectively. We derive analytic results for the fluctuations in the
number of particles exiting the boundaries of the finite confining box. The
statistical properties of this quantity crucially depend on how the system is
prepared initially. Two common types of averages employed to understand the
impact of initial conditions in stochastic systems are annealed and quenched
averages. It is well known that for an infinitely extended system, these
different initial conditions produce quantitatively different fluctuations,
even in the infinite time limit. We demonstrate explicitly that in finite
systems, annealed and quenched fluctuations become equal beyond a system-size
dependent timescale, $t \sim L^2$. For diffusing particles, the fluctuations
exhibit a $\sqrt{t}$ growth at short times and decay as $1/\sqrt{t}$ for time
scales, $t \gg L^2/D$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant. Meanwhile, for
run-and-tumble particles, the fluctuations grow linearly at short times and
then decay as $1/\sqrt{t}$ for time scales, $t \gg L^2/D_{\text{eff}}$, where
$D_{\text{eff}}$ represents the effective diffusive constant for run-and-tumble
particles. To study the effect of confinement in detail, we also analyze two
different setups (i) with one reflecting boundary and (ii) with both boundaries
open.

</p><i>A. Skarlatos, A. Martínez-De-Guerenu, R. Miorelli, A. Lasaosa, C. Reboud</i>
<p>In this work, two different parametric hysteresis models, the Jiles-Atherton
model and the Mel'gui relation, have been combined to form a more general
hysteresis operator, suitable for the description of families of experimental
B(H) curves obtained for low carbon (LC) steel specimens after isothermal
annealing at different temperatures and times. As it has been demonstrated in a
number of previous studies, characteristic values of steel hysteresis curves
can be used as very efficient identifiers for the monitoring of the different
metallurgical transformations that take place during the annealing, such as
recovery and recrystallisation processes. It is thus important from a practical
point to be able to reproduce the experimental curves obtained under different
conditions, as precisely as possible, in order to proceed to the samples
characterisation. Hybridisation of the two aforementioned models demonstrated
satisfactory results for the reproduction of all considered curves obtained
under the different considered annealing conditions.

<br>
</p><i>Tyler Lutz, Andreas M. Menzel, Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider</i>
<p>Functionalized thin elastic films and membranes frequently feature internal
sites of net forces or stresses. These are, for instance, active sites of
actuation, or rigid inclusions in a strained membrane that induce counterstress
upon externally imposed deformations. We theoretically analyze the geometry of
isotropic, flat, thin, linearly elastic films or membranes of finite thickness,
laterally extended to infinity. At the mathematical core of such
characterizations are the fundamental solutions for localized force and stress
singularities associated with corresponding Green's functions. We derive such
solutions in three dimensions and place them into the context of previous
two-dimensional calculations. To this end, we consider both no-slip and
stress-free conditions at the top and/or bottom surfaces. We provide an
understanding for why the fully free-standing thin elastic membrane leads to
diverging solutions in most geometries and compare these situations to the
truly two-dimensional case. A no-slip support of at least one of the surfaces
stabilizes the solution, which illustrates that the divergences in the fully
free-standing case are connected to global deformations. Within the mentioned
framework, our results are important for associated theoretical
characterizations of thin elastic films, whether supported or free-standing,
and of membranes subject to internal or external forces or stresses.

<h3>Origin of the Apparent Electric-Field Dependence of Electrostrictive  Coefficients</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14015</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiacheng Yu, Abdelali Zaki, Killian Mache, Omar Ibder, Sandrine Coste, Maud Barré, Philippe Lacorre, Pierre-Eymeric Janolin</i>
<p>Electrostrictive materials exhibit a strain that is proportional to the
square of the induced polarization. In linear dielectrics where the
permittivity is constant, this electromechanical strain is also proportional to
the square of the electric field. However, under increasing amplitudes of the
driving field, the electromechanical strain sometimes saturates; the
electrostrictive coefficients therefore appear to depend on the amplitude of
the electric field used to measure them. Here, we present a methodology showing
that this apparent field dependence is a consequence of neglecting higher-order
electromechanical phenomena. When these are taken into account, not only do the
electrostrictive coefficients remain constant but the signs of the high-order
coefficients enable the prediction of the saturation behavior from a single
measurement. We illustrate this approach on both classical and non-classical
(so-called ``giant'') electrostrictors.

<h3>Dynamical scaling and Planckian dissipation due to heavy-fermion quantum  criticality</h3>

</p><i>Andreas Gleis, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Gabriel Kotliar, Jan von Delft</i>
<p>We study dynamical scaling associated with a Kondo-breakdown quantum critical
point (KB-QCP) of the periodic Anderson model, treated by two-site cellular
dynamical mean-field theory (2CDMFT). In the quantum critical region, the
staggered spin exhibits SYK-like slow dynamics and its dynamical susceptibility
shows $\omega/T$ scaling. We propose a scaling Ansatz that describes this
behavior. It also implies Planckian dissipation for the longest-lived
excitations. The current susceptibility follows the same scaling ansatz,
leading to strange-metal scaling. This demonstrates that the KB-QCP described
by 2CDMFT is an intrinsic (i.e., disorder-free) strange-metal fixed point.
Surprisingly, the SYK-like dynamics and scaling are driven by strong vertex
contributions to the susceptibilities. Our results for the optical conductivity
match experimental observations on YbRh${}_2$Si${}_2$ and CeCoIn${}_5$.

<p>The synthesis of solar methanol through direct CO2 hydrogenation using solar
energy is of great importance in advancing a sustainable energy economy. In
this study, non-precious NiZn intermetallic/ZnO catalyst is reported to
catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol using sunlight irradiation
(1sun). The NiZn-ZnO interface is identified as the active site to stabilize
the key intermediates of HxCO*. At ambient pressure, the NiZn-ZnO catalyst
demonstrates a methanol production rate of 127.5 umol g-1h-1 from solar driven
CO2 hydrogenation, with a remarkable 100% selectivity towards methanol in the
total organic products. Notably, this production rate stands as the highest
record for photothermic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in continuous-flow
reactors with sunlight as the only requisite energy input. This discovery not
only paves the way for the development of novel catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation
to methanol but also marks a significant stride towards a full solar-driven

<p>Atomic structures of Al-Co-Cu decagonal quasicrystals (QCs) are investigated
using empirical oscillating pair potentials (EOPP) in molecular dynamic (MD)
simulations that we enhance by Monte Carlo (MC) swapping of chemical species
and replica exchange. Predicted structures exhibit planar decagonal tilin g
patterns and are periodic along the perpendicular direction. We then
recalculate the energies of promising structures using first-principles density
functional theory (DFT), along with energies of competing phases. We find that
our $\tau$-inflated sequence of QC approximants are energetically unstable a t
low temperature by at least 3 meV/atom. Extending our study to finite
temperatures by calculating harmonic vibrational entropy, as well as anharmonic
contributions that include chemical species swaps and tile flips, our results
suggest that the quasicrystal phase is entropically stabilized at temperatur es
in the range 600-800K and above. It decomposes into ordinary (though complex)
crystal phases at low temperatures, including a partially disordered B2-type
phase. We discuss the influence of density and composition on QC phase
stability; we compare the structural differences between Co-rich and Cu-rich
quasicrystals; and we analyze the role of entropy in stabilizing the
quasicrystal, concluding with a discussion of the possible existence of "high
entropy" quasicrystals.

<p>Hydrogen is playing a crucial role in the green energy transition. Yet, its
tendency to react with and diffuse into surrounding materials poses a
challenge. Therefore, it is critical to develop coatings that protect
hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive-hydrogen environments. In this
work, we report group IV-V transition metal carbide (TMC) thin films as
potential candidates for hydrogen-protective coatings in hydrogen radical (H*)
environments at elevated temperatures. We identify three classes of TMCs based
on the reduction of carbides and surface oxides (TMOx). HfC, ZrC, TiC, TaC,
NbC, and VC (class A) are found to have a stable carbidic-C (TM-C) content,
with a further sub-division into partial (class A1: HfC, ZrC, and TiC) and
strong (class A2: TaC, NbC, and VC) surface TMOx reduction. In contrast to
class A, a strong carbide reduction is observed in Co2C (class B), along with a
strong surface TMOx reduction. The H*-TMC/TMOx interaction is hypothesized to
entail three processes: (i) hydrogenation of surface C/O-atoms, (ii) formation
of CHx/OHx species, and (iii) subsurface C/O-atoms diffusion to the surface
vacancies. The number of adsorbed H-atoms required to form CHx/OHx species (i),
and the corresponding energy barriers (ii) are estimated based on the change in
the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) for the reduction reactions of TMCs and TMOx.
Hydrogenation of surface carbidic-C-atoms is proposed to limit the reduction of
TMCs, whereas the reduction of surface TMOx is governed by the thermodynamic
barrier for forming H2O.

<h3>Anomalous dispersion via dissipative coupling in a quantum well  exciton-polariton microcavity</h3>

</p><i>Dąbrówka Biegańska, Maciej Pieczarka, Christian Schneider, Sven Höfling, Sebastian Klembt, Marcin Syperek</i>
<p>According to the principles of quantum mechanics the Hamiltonian describing a
closed system's energies must be Hermitian. This leads to an avoided crossing
on resonance, as coupling between states causes the energy levels to repel.
This concept lies at the heart of exciton-polariton physics, where coherent
exciton-photon interaction causes polariton branches to repel in momentum
dispersion. However, non-Hermitian physics predicts an opposite effect: level
attraction, which occurs when significant energy dissipation is present in the
system. Here, we show a manifestation of dissipative coupling in a high-quality
AlGaAs-based polariton microcavity, where two polariton branches attract,
resulting in an anomalous, inverted dispersion of the lower branch in momentum
dispersion. We observe the evolution of the level attraction with
exciton-photon detuning, leading to changes in anomalous dispersion shape
within a single sample. The dissipative coupling is explained by the
interaction with an indirect exciton, acting as a highly dissipative channel in
our system, and the observed dispersions are well captured within a
phenomenological model. Our results present a new mechanism of dissipative
coupling in light-matter systems and offer a tunable and well-controlled
AlGaAs-based platform for engineering the non-Hermitian and negative mass
effects in polariton systems.

</p><i>Youjia Huang, Shu Nagata, Joseph Jachinowski, Jiazhong Hu, Cheng Chin</i>
<p>We demonstrate two-dimensional arrays of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as
a new experimental platform with parallel quantum simulation capability. A
defect-free array of up to 49 BECs is formed by loading a single BEC with
50,000 atoms into 7*7 optical wells. Each BEC is prepared with independent
phases, confirmed by matterwave interference. Based on BEC arrays, we realize
fast determination of the phase boundary of BECs with attractive interactions.
We also observe the stochastic collapse dynamics from the distribution of atom
numbers in the array. We show that the collapse of a BEC can occur much faster
than the averaged decay of an ensemble. The BEC arrays enable new forms of
experiments to drastically increase the measurement throughput and to quantum
simulate, say, large 2D Josephson-junction arrays.

<p>The rise of electron microscopy has expanded our ability to acquire nanometer
and atomically resolved images of complex materials. The resulting vast
datasets are typically analyzed by human operators, an intrinsically
challenging process due to the multiple possible analysis steps and the
corresponding need to build and optimize complex analysis workflows. We present
a methodology based on the concept of a Reward Function coupled with Bayesian
Optimization, to optimize image analysis workflows dynamically. The Reward
Function is engineered to closely align with the experimental objectives and
broader context and is quantifiable upon completion of the analysis. Here,
cross-section, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of ion-irradiated
(Y, \text{Dy})\text{Ba}_2\text{Cu}_3\text{O}_{7-\delta} thin-films were used as
a model system. The reward functions were formed based on the expected
materials density and atomic spacings and used to drive multi-objective
optimization of the classical Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) method. These results
can be benchmarked against the DCNN segmentation. This optimized LoG* compares
favorably against DCNN in the presence of the additional noise. We further
extend the reward function approach towards the identification of
partially-disordered regions, creating a physics-driven reward function and
action space of high-dimensional clustering. We pose that with correct
definition, the reward function approach allows real-time optimization of
complex analysis workflows at much higher speeds and lower computational costs
than classical DCNN-based inference, ensuring the attainment of results that
are both precise and aligned with the human-defined objectives.

<h3>Cavity-enhanced Kondo effect</h3>

</p><i>Jun Mochida, Yuto Ashida</i>
<p>In metals containing magnetic impurities, conduction electrons screen the
magnetic impurities and induce the Kondo effect, i.e., the enhancement of the
electrical resistance at low temperatures. Motivated by recent advances in
manipulating quantum materials by cavity confinement, we study how the
ultrastrong light-matter coupling can affect the Kondo effect. We show that the
ultrastrong coupling can enhance the Kondo temperature and give rise to several
notable phenomena, including universal scalings of the cavity-modified Kondo
effect, the photon occupation number, and the entanglement entropy between the
cavity and electrons. The origin of the cavity enhancement can be understood
from the mass renormalization due to the cavity-mediated nonlocal
electron-electron interaction, which is akin to the polaronic mass enhancement.
We combine the unitary transformations and the Gaussian variational states to
analyze the quantum impurity system confined in the cavity. Our nonperturbative
framework can be applied to a variety of quantum impurity problems influenced
by structured quantum electromagnetic environment.

<p>The negatively-charged boron vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) center in hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) is currently garnering considerable attention for the
design of two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensing units. Such developments require
a precise understanding of the spin-dependent optical response of
V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which still remains poorly documented despite its key
role for sensing applications. Here we investigate the spin-dependent
photodynamics of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in hBN by a series of time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL) measurements. We first introduce a robust all-optical
method to infer the spin-dependent lifetime of the excited states and the
electron spin polarization of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers under optical pumping.
Using these results, we then analyze PL time traces recorded at different
optical excitation powers with a seven-level model of the V$_\text{B}^-$ center
and we extract all the rates involved in the spin-dependent optical cycles,
both under ambient conditions and at liquid helium temperature. These findings
are finally used to study the impact of a vector magnetic field on the optical
response. More precisely, we analyze PL quenching effects resulting from
electron spin mixing induced by the magnetic field component perpendicular to
the V$_\text{B}^-$ quantization axis. All experimental results are well
reproduced by the seven-level model, illustrating its robustness to describe
the spin-dependent photodymanics of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers. This work provides
important insights into the properties of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in hBN, which
are valuable for future developments of 2D quantum sensing units.

<h3>Dynamical Spectra of Spin Supersolid States in Triangular  Antiferromagnets</h3>

<p>We employ tensor network renormalization to explore the dynamical spectra of
the easy-axis triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) in a magnetic field.
Our analysis identifies two distinct low-energy magnon excitations: a gapless
Goldstone mode and a gapped mode. At zero field, the spectra display two nearly
degenerate roton modes near the M point. With the increase of the magnetic
field within the Y-shape superfluid phase, these modes diverge, with the roton
excitation vanishing from the Goldstone mode branch, suggesting that the roton
dip in this mode may just result from the energy-level repulsion imposed by the
roton excitation in the gapped mode. Moreover, the in-plane spectral function
shows substantial weight in high energies in the same spin excitation channel
where the low-energy roton excitation appears. However, these roton excitations
are absent in the V-shape supersolid phase.

<h3>Optimal frequency for undulatory motion in granular media</h3>

<p>Sand is a highly dissipative system, where the local spatial arrangements and
densities depend strongly on the applied forces, resulting in fluid-like or
solid-like behaviour. This makes sand swimming challenging and intriguing,
raising questions about the nature of the motion and how to optimize the design
of artificial swimmers able to swim in sand. Recent experiments suggest that
lateral undulatory motion enables efficient locomotion, with a non-monotonic
dependence of the swimming speed on the undulatory frequency and the height of
the sediment bed. Here, we propose a quasi-2D granular model, where the effect
of the bed height is modeled by a coarse-grained frictional force with the
substrate. We show that the optimal frequency coincides with the second
vibrational mode of the swimmer and explain the underlying mechanism through a
characterization of the rheology of the medium. Potential implications in the
design of artificial swimmers are discussed.

<h3>Edge-selective reconfiguration in polarized lattices with magnet-enabled  bistability</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14171" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14171</a>
<br>
</p><i>Luca Iorio, Raffaele Ardito, Stefano Gonella</i>
<p>The signature topological feature of Maxwell lattices is their polarization,
which manifests as an unbalance in stiffness between opposite edges of a finite
domain. The manifestation of this asymmetry is especially dramatic in the case
of soft lattices undergoing large nonlinear deformation under concentrated
loads, where the excess of softness at the soft edge can result in the
activation of sharp indentations. This study explores how this mechanical
dichotomy between edges can be tuned and possibly extremized by working with
soft magneto-mechanical metamaterials. The magneto-mechanical coupling is
obtained by endowing the lattice sites with permanent magnets, which activate a
network of magnetic forces that can interact with (either augmenting or
competing with) the elasticity of the material. Specifically, under
sufficiently large deformation that macroscopically alters the equilibrium
positions of the sites, the attractive forces between the magnets can trigger
bistable reconfiguration mechanisms. The strength of such mechanisms depends on
the landscapes of elastic reaction forces exhibited by the edges, which are
different due to the polarization, and is therefore inherently edge-selective.
We show that, on the soft edge, the addition of magnets simply enhances the
softness of the edge. In contrast, on the stiff edge, the magnets activate
snapping mechanisms that locally reconfigure the cells and produce a lattice
response reminiscent of plasticity, characterized by residual deformation that
persists upon unloading.

<h3>Non-equilibrium structure and relaxation in active microemulsions</h3>

<p>Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified
by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the
transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles
in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an
active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and
relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two
distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken
detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.

<p>Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as
high-temperature superconducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry
explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the
paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the
structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume
of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum
distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear
relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the
steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is
the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints
including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two
object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately
optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach
successfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as
spinel, pyrochlore-$\alpha$, and $\mathrm{K}_2 \mathrm{NiF}_4$ structures.

<h3>Record high superconducting transition temperature in Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$  alloy with rich magnetic element Mn</h3>

</p><i>Ying-Jie Zhang, Yijie Zhu, Qing Li, Zhe-Ning Xiang, Tianheng Huang, Jian Sun, Hai-Hu Wen</i>
<p>It is well-known that magnetic moments are very harmful to superconductivity.
A typical example is the element Mn whose compounds usually exhibit strong
magnetism. Thus, it is very hard to achieve superconductivity in materials
containing Mn. Here, we report enhanced superconductivity with the
superconducting transition temperature ($T_\text{c}$) up to a record high-value
of about 26 K in a beta-phase Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloy containing rich magnetic
element Mn under high pressures. This is contrary to the intuition that the
magnetic moments always suppress superconductivity. Under high pressures, we
also found that in the middle-pressure regime, the Pauli limit of the upper
critical field is surpassed. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction data shows an
unchanged beta-phase with a continuous contraction of the cell volume, which is
well supported by the first-principles calculations. Although the theoretical
results based on electron-phonon coupling (EPC) can interpret the $T_\text{c}$
value in a certain pressure region, the monotonic enhancement of
superconductivity by pressure cannot seek support from the theory. Our results
show a surprising enhancement of superconductivity in Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloy
with a considerable Mn content.

<p>To control the magnon transport in magnetic systems is of great interest in
magnonics. Due to the feasibility of electric field, how to generate and
manipulate magnon with pure electrical method is one of the most desired goals.
Here we propose that the magnon spin current is generated by applying
time-dependent electric field, where the coupling between the magnon and
electric field is invoked via Aharonov-Casher effect. In particular, the magnon
spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to
the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model
and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band
geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and
electric-control-magnon mechanisms.

<h3>Electrical spin manipulation in double SrTiO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ quantum dots</h3>

</p><i>B. Szafran, M. Zegrodnik, M.P. Nowak, R. Citro, P. Wojcik</i>
<p>The spin dynamics in two electron double quantum dots embedded in two
dimensional electron gas at the interface between SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ is
studied by an exact numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation, in the context of the electric dipole spin resonance experiment.
Based on the three band model of $3d$-electrons localized at Ti ions on the
square lattice we analyze in details the singlet-triplet transition induced by
the AC electric field, in the magnetic field range close to the avoided
crossing which appears as a result of the spin-orbit coupling. Our calculations
show that for symmetric double quantum dots the single photon spin-flip
transitions is prohibited due to the parity symmetry and the transition can
occur only by the higher order two-photon processes. For a weakly asymmetric
system, when the first order singlet-triplet transitions are released due to
the parity symmetry breaking, the spin-flip transition has a character of the
Rabi oscillations for a low electric field amplitude. As the amplitude is
increased the frequency of the transition is blueshifted (redshifted) for the
magnetic field below (above) the single-triplet avoided crossing.
Interestingly, for a sufficiently high magnetic field and high AC field
amplitude the electric field drives the system across the avoided crossing
inducing the spin-flip by the Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg-Majorana transitions
with 100\% spin flip probability for a slow sweep. Finally, the optimization of
the geometrical parameters of the system with respect to the time of spin-flip
of its fidelity is also presented.

<h3>Dipolar order controls dielectric response of glass-forming liquids</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Till Böhmer, Florian Pabst, Jan P. Gabriel, Thomas Blochowicz</i>
<p>The dielectric response of liquids reflects both, reorientation of single
molecular dipoles and collective modes, i.e., dipolar cross-correlations. A
recent theory predicts the latter to produce an additional slow peak in the
dielectric loss spectrum. Following this idea we argue that in supercooled
liquids the high-frequency power law exponent of the dielectric loss $\beta$
should be correlated with the degree of dipolar order, i.e., the Kirkwood
correlation factor $g_K$. This notion is confirmed for 25 supercooled liquids.
While our findings support recent theoretical work the results are shown to
violate the earlier Kivelson-Madden theory.

absorption and conversion of light energy into thermal energy in the visible
range of the spectrum, which makes them promising in various applications, from
biomedical to environmental protection. In this work, it is shown that titanium
nitride nanoparticles also possess promising adsorption capabilitieseffect. TiN
nanoparticles were synthesized by laser ablation method in liquid. Water,
acetone and acetonitrile are used as solvent. Nanoparticles were characterized
by scanning and transmission microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, which showed the
formation of the under-stoichiometric titanium nitride (TiN1-x). TiN
nanoparticles are investigated as a promising object for high adsorption It is
shown that adsorption of TiN nanoparticles is associated with the electrostatic
effect and the presence of pores in the synthesized nanoparticles. Optimal dye
absorption capabilities were found to be associated with a low amount of Ti
vacancies and high amount of N vacancies acting as donor states. The particles
synthesized in water have the highest sorption capacity of dye achieving the

<p>Granular $\text{L}1_0$-FePt thin films with small columnar grains are
essential for heat-assisted magnetic recording media. While hexagonal boron
nitride(h-BN) has proven effective for promoting columnar FePt grains, we
explored multilayer graphene as an alternative grain boundary material
leveraging its structural similarity to h-BN. The FePt granular thin films with
carbon-based grain boundary materials(GBMs) were deposited by cosputtering on
Si/SiO2 substrates with substrate bias at 650{\deg}C. The RF bias and high
temperature facilitated formation of interlinked graphene nanoribbons wrapping
around FePt grains, yielding 7.5 nm diameter, 8 nm height grains with an order
parameter of 0.78 and a perpendicular coercivity of 40 kOe. However, the
formation of graphene nanoribbons could not effectively promote columnar
structures, likely due to co-existing amorphous carbon in grain boundaries.
Optimizing deposition to improve graphene grain boundary quality is necessary
to realize this 2D material's potential for achieving desirable microstructures
for HAMR media.

indicates a heating of the adsorbate layer on a time scale of a few ps,
suggesting coupling to phononic degrees of freedom of the substrate as the
primary energy transfer channel for the vibrational excitation of the adsorbate
layer. Remarkably, the transient photoelectron diffraction signal not only
provides direct information about the structural dynamics of the adsorbate, but
also about the charge carrier dynamics of the substrate. The presented concept
combined with momentum microscopy could become a versatile tool for the
comprehensive investigation of the coupled charge and vibrational dynamics of

<p>Large quantities of random numbers are crucial in a wide range of
applications. We have recently demonstrated that perpendicular nanopillar
magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs) can produce true random bits when actuated
with short pulses. However, our implementation used high-end and expensive
electronics, such as a high bandwidth arbitrary waveform generator and
analog-to-digital converter, and was limited to relatively low data rates.
Here, we significantly increase the speed of true random number generation
(TRNG) of our stochastic actuated pMTJs (SMART-pMTJs) using Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs), demonstrating the generation of over $10^{12}$ bits at
rates exceeding 10Mb/s. The resulting bitstreams pass the NIST Statistical Test
Suite for randomness with only one XOR operation. In addition to a hundred-fold
reduction in the setup cost and a thousand-fold increase in bitrate, the
advancement includes simplifying and optimizing random bit generation with a
custom-designed analog daughter board to interface an FPGA and SMART-pMTJ. The
resulting setup further enables FPGA at-speed processing of MTJ data for
stochastic modeling and cryptography.

<p>Crystallization of rubrene, progressing from an amorphous phase to a
triclinic meta-stable and ultimately to the orthorhombic stable phase, offers
broad applications not only in organic electronic devices but also for in-depth
studies of optical and electronic properties, including exciton distribution
and dynamics. We investigate the crystallization of rubrene on highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), aiming at the growth of the preferred rubrene
orthorhombic phase, which has been reported to have one of the highest charge
mobilities in organic semiconductors. This is achieved through controlled
heating and enhanced partial pressure. Through precise control of the initial
deposition on the substrate, we investigate the growth habit of rubrene
crystals by high-rate heat treatment beyond the second crystallization
temperature. Furthermore, this work addresses thermal stability and
photodegradation across various morphologies.

<p>Non-collinear magnetic skyrmion lattices provide novel magnonic
functionalities due to their topological magnon bands and asymmetric dispersion
relations. Magnon excitations with intermediate wavelengths comparable to
inter-skyrmion distances are particularly interesting but largely unexplored so
far due to experimental challenges. Here, we report the detection of such
magnons with wavevectors q $\simeq$ 48 rad/um in the metastable skyrmion
lattice phase of the bulk chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ using micro-focused
Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Thanks to its high sensitivity and broad
bandwidth we resolved various excitation modes of a single skyrmion lattice
domain over a wide magnetic field regime. Besides the known modes with dipole
character, quantitative comparison of frequencies and spectral weights to
theoretical predictions enabled the identification of a quadrupole mode and
observation of signatures which we attribute to a decupole and a sextupole
mode. Our combined experimental and theoretical work highlights that skyrmionic
phases allow for the design of magnonic devices exploiting topological magnon
bands.

</p><i>Claudio Gonzalez-Fuentes, Maria Abellan, Simon Oyarzun, Christian Orellana</i>
<p>We have developed a novel, compact and cost-effective magneto-optical method
for quantifying the spin-orbit torque (SOT) effective field vector (hSO) in
magnetic thin films subjected to spin current injection. The damping-like
(hSODL) component of the vector is obtained by the polar Kerr response arising
from the out-of-plane magnetization tilting, whereas the field-like component
(hSODL) is obtained by current-induced hysteresis-loop shifting study, using
conventional longitudinal Kerr magnetometry.
We tested our method in FM/NM bilayers comprising NiFe, CoFeB (ferromagnetic
layers) and Pt, Pd, Ta (non-magnetic layers). Our findings revealed a
damping-like SOT efficiency xiDL of 0.089 pm 0.006,0.019 pm 0.002, and -0.132
pm 0.009 for Pt, Pd, and Ta, respectively. The hSOFL/hSODL ratio was 0.35 pm
0.02 for NiFe/Pt and 0.14 pm 0.002 for Ta/CoFeB bilayers when the ferromagnetic
layer thickness is 4nm.
A key advancement over the state-of-art magneto-optical methods is the use of
an oblique light incidence angle, which allows switching between measuring
modes for hSODL and hSOFL, without altering the experimental setup. Moreover,
our approach relies exclusively on first-order Kerr effects, thereby ensuring
its broad applicability to any type of ferromagnetic material.

<p>Palladium (Pd) catalysts have been extensively studied for the direct
synthesis of H2O through the hydrogen oxidation reaction at ambient conditions.
This heterogeneous catalytic reaction not only holds considerable practical
significance but also serves as a classical model for investigating fundamental
mechanisms, including adsorption and reactions between adsorbates. Nonetheless,
the governing mechanisms and kinetics of its intermediate reaction stages under
varying gas conditions remains elusive. This is attributed to the intricate
interplay between adsorption, atomic diffusion, and concurrent phase
transformation of catalyst. Herein, the Pd-catalyzed, water-forming hydrogen
oxidation is studied, in situ, to investigate intermediate reaction stages via
fluid cell transmission electron microscopy. The dynamic behaviors of water
generation, associated with reversible palladium hydride formation, are
captured in real time with a nanoscale spatial resolution. Our findings suggest
that the hydrogen oxidation rate catalyzed by Pd is significantly affected by
the sequence in which gases are introduced. Through direct evidence of electron
diffraction and density functional theory calculation, we demonstrate that the
hydrogen oxidation rate is limited by adsorption processes of gas precursors.
These nanoscale insights help identify the optimal reaction conditions for
Pd-catalyzed hydrogen oxidation, which has substantial implications for water
production technologies. The developed understanding also advocates a broader
exploration of analogous mechanisms in other metal-catalyzed reactions.

<p>Floquet engineering is a novel method of manipulating quantum phases of

different platforms ranging from photonic systems [3] to optical lattice of

insulator [6], their manifestations have been seen in a number of other
experiments [7-14]. By engineering the electronic band structure using
Floquet-Bloch states, various exotic phase transitions have been predicted
[15-22] to occur. To realize these phases, it is necessary to better understand
the nature of Floquet-Bloch states in different materials. However, direct
energy and momentum resolved observation of these states is still limited to
only few material systems [6, 10, 14, 23, 24]. Here, we report direct
observation of Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer epitaxial graphene which was
the first proposed material platform [15] for Floquet engineering. By using
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with mid-infrared
(mid-IR) pump excitation, we detected replicas of the Dirac cone. Pump
polarization dependence of these replica bands unequivocally shows that they
originate from the scattering between Floquet-Bloch states and photon-dressed
free-electron-like photoemission final states, called Volkov states. Beyond
graphene, our method can potentially be used to directly observe Floquet-Bloch
states in other systems paving the way for Floquet engineering in a wide range
of quantum materials.

<p>We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting
with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron
hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This
unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals with a skyrmion
topological charge of 1 and 2 at a zero magnetic field. Diverse multipolar
phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of
conduction electrons.

<p>Different insulator phases compete with each other in strongly correlated
materials with simultaneous local and non-local interactions. It is known that
the homogeneous Mott insulator converts into a charge density wave (CDW) phase
when the non-local interactions are increased, but there is ongoing debate on
whether and in which parameter regimes this transition is of first order, or of
second order with an intermediate bond-order wave phase. Here we show that
strong-field optics applied to an extended Fermi-Hubbard system can serve as a
powerful tool to reveal the nature of the quantum phase transition.
Specifically, we show that in the strongly interacting regime characteristic
excitations such as excitons, biexcitons, excitonic strings, and charge
droplets can be tracked by the non-linear optical response to an ultrafast and
intense laser pulse. Subcycle analysis of high harmonic spectra unravels the
ultrafast dynamics of these increasingly complex objects, which partially
escape the scrutiny of linear optics. Their appearance in the high harmonic
spectrum provides striking evidence of a first-order transition into the CDW
phase, and makes a strong case for using strong-field optics as a powerful tool
to reveal the nature of quasiparticles in strongly correlated matter, and to
track the electron dynamics during a first-order quantum phase transition.
