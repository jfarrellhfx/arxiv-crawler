<h3>Two-dimensional THz spectroscopy of nonlinear phononics in the  topological insulator $\mathrm{MnBi}_2\mathrm{Te}_4$</h3>

The interaction of a single-cycle THz electric field with the topological
insulator $\mathrm{MnBi}_2\mathrm{Te}_4$ triggers strongly anharmonic lattice
dynamics, promoting fully coherent energy transfer between the otherwise
non-interacting Raman-active $E_g$ and infrared (IR)-active $E_u$ phononic
modes. Two-dimensional (2D) THz spectroscopy combined with modeling based on
the classical equations of motion and symmetry analysis reveals the multi-stage
process underlying the excitation of the Raman-active $E_g$ phonon. In this
process, the THz electric field first prepares a coherent IR-active $E_u$
phononic state and subsequently interacts with this state to efficiently excite
the $E_g$ phonon.

The ability to sensitively image electric fields is important for
understanding many nanoelectronic phenomena, including charge accumulation at
surfaces and interfaces and field distributions in active electronic devices. A
particularly exciting application is the visualization of domain patterns in
ferroelectric and nanoferroic materials owing to their potential in computing
and data storage. Here, we use a scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) microscope,
well known for its use in magnetometry, to image domain patterns in
piezoelectric (Pb[Zr$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$]O$_{3}$) and improper ferroelectric
(YMnO$_{3}$) materials through their electric fields. Electric field detection
is enabled by measuring the Stark shift of the NV spin using a gradiometric
detection scheme. Analysis of the electric field maps allows us to discriminate
between different types of surface charge distributions, as well as to
reconstruct maps of the three-dimensional electric field vector and charge
density. The ability to measure both stray electric and magnetic fields under
ambient conditions opens exciting opportunities for the study of multiferroic
and multifunctional materials and devices.

<h3>Superconductivity in monolayer and few-layer graphene: III  Impurity-induced subgap states and quasi-particle interference patterns</h3>

<br>
We consider the most energetically favorable symmetry-allowed spin-singlet
and spin-triplet superconducting pairing symmetries in monolayer and few-layer
graphene, and for each calculate the energy spectrum in the presence of a
scalar or magnetic impurity. We find that two doubly degenerate subgap states
exist for scalar impurities for all types of pairing, except for the
spin-singlet $s$-wave state. For magnetic impurities, two or four subgap states
may form depending on the order parameter symmetry. We find that the spin
polarization of these states allows one to distinguish between spin-singlet and
triplet pairing, for example, only the spin-triplet states show opposite-energy
subgap states with the same spin. We also calculate the quasi-particle
interference patterns associated with the subgap states and find that they
exhibit features that could distinguish between different types of pairing
symmetries, especially a breaking of rotational symmetry for nodal states,
stronger for the spin-singlet $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ than for the
spin-triplet $p_x$ and $p_y$ states.

<h3>Topological phases in the presence of disorder and longer-range  interactions</h3>

We study the combined effects of disorder and range of the couplings on the
phase diagram of one-dimensional topological superconductors. We consider an
extended version of the Kitaev chain where hopping and pairing terms couple
many sites. Deriving the conditions for the existence of Majorana zero modes,
we show that either the range and the on-site disorder can greatly enhance the
topological phases characterized by the appearance of one or many Majorana
modes localized at the edges. We consider both a discrete and a continuous
disorder distribution. Moreover we discuss the role of correlated disorder
which might further widen the topological regions. Finally we show that in the
purely long-range regime and in the presence of disorder, the spatial decay of
the edge modes remains either algebraic or exponential, with eventually a
modified localization length, as in the absence of disorder.

<h3>Fluctuation dominated phase ordering in coarse-grained depth models:  Domain wall structures, extreme values and coarsening</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07471" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07471</a>
<br>
<i>Arghya Das, Mustansir Barma</i>
<br>
<br>
Models of particles driven by a one-dimensional fluctuating surface are known
to exhibit fluctuation dominated phase ordering (FDPO), in which both the order
and fluctuations appear on macroscopic scales. Highly dynamic and
macroscopically broad interfacial regions, each composed of many domain walls,
appear between macroscopically ordered regions and consequently the scaled
correlation function violates the Porod law. We focus on two essential
quantities which together quantify the unique characteristics of FDPO, namely
the total number of domain walls and the length of the largest cluster. We
present results in the context of coarse-grained depth (CD) models, both in
steady state and while coarsening. Analytic arguments supported by numerical
simulations show that even though domain wall number fluctuations are very
strong, surprisingly the associated variance remains constant in time during
coarsening. Further, the length of the largest cluster grows as a power law
with significant multiplicative logarithms which involve both the time and
system size. In addition, we identify significant corrections to the leading
power law scaling in several quantities in the coarsening regime. We also study
a generalisation of the CD model in which the domain wall density is controlled
by a fugacity. This model shows a mixed order phase transition with the regular
CD model (which exhibits FDPO) corresponding to the critical point.

<h3>Method of difference-differential equations for some Bethe ansatz  solvable models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07480</a>
<br>
<i>Zoran Ristivojevic</i>
<br>
<br>
In studies of one-dimensional Bethe ansatz solvable models, a Fredholm
integral equation of the second kind with a difference kernel on a finite
interval often appears. This equation does not generally admit a closed-form
solution and hence its analysis is quite complicated. Here we study a family of
such equations concentrating on their moments. We find exact relations between
the moments in the form of difference-differential equations. The latter
results significantly advance the analysis, enabling one to practically
determine all the moments from the explicit knowledge of the lowest one. As
applications, first we study the moments of the quasimomentum distribution in
the Lieb-Liniger model and find explicit analytical results. The latter moments
determine several basic quantities, e.g., the $N$-body local correlation
functions. We prove the equivalence between different expressions found in the
literature for the three-body local correlation functions and find an exact
result for the four-body local correlation function in terms of the moments of
the quasimomentum distributions. We eventually find the analytical results for
the three- and four-body correlation functions in the form of asymptotic series
in the regimes of weak and strong interactions. Next, we study the exact form
of the low-energy spectrum of a magnon (a polaron) excitation in the
two-component Bose gas described by the Yang-Gaudin model. We find its explicit
form, which depends on the moments of the quasimomentum distributions of the
Lieb-Liniger model. Then, we address a seemingly unrelated problem of
capacitance of a circular capacitor and express the exact result for the
capacitance in the parametric form. In the most interesting case of short plate
separations, the parametric form has a single logarithmic term. This should be
contrasted with the explicit result that has a complicated structure of
logarithms.

<h3>Exact Results for the Moments of the Rapidity Distribution in  Galilean-Invariant Integrable Models</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a class of Galilean-invariant one-dimensional Bethe ansatz solvable
models in the thermodynamic limit. Their rapidity distribution obeys an
integral equation with a difference kernel over a finite interval, which does
not admit a closed-form solution. We develop a general formalism enabling one
to study the moments of the rapidity distribution, showing that they satisfy a
difference-differential equation. The derived equation is explicitly analyzed
in the case of the Lieb-Liniger model and the moments are analytically
calculated. In addition, we obtained the exact information about the
ground-state energy at weak repulsion. The obtained results directly enter a
number of physically relevant quantities.

<h3>Segmentation of pores within concrete-epoxy interface using synchronous  chemical composition mapping and backscattered electron imaging</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07493" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07493</a>
<br>
<i>Andrzej M. Żak, Anna Wieczorek, Agnieszka Chowaniec, Lukasz Sadowski</i>
<br>
<br>
The method of assessing porosity using images from scanning electron
microscopy is ineffective in situations where the substrate and the coating
have a significantly different average atomic number, which results in a
different contrast of backscattered electrons. For this reason, the analyzes
carried out to date were usually based on the manual distinction of important
microstructure elements, which was followed by selective thresholding. However,
this method depends on the subjective action of the researcher, and may result
in errors that are difficult to estimate. The presented method is based on the
simultaneous collection of both the image of backscattered electrons and
elemental maps obtained using an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer. Multivariate
comparative analysis of the matrix was used to characterize a technique of
distinguishing epoxy resin from a hydrated cement-based substrate. The proposed
algorithm significantly facilitates the detection of individual interface
components, and also makes comparative analyzes repeatable and reliable.

<h3>Mpemba effect in terms of mean first passage times of overdamped  Langevin dynamics on a double-well potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07496</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew R. Walker, Marija Vucelja</i>
<br>
<br>
The Mpemba effect occurs when a system prepared at a hot temperature cools
down faster than its warm temperature copy. We derive the necessary conditions
for the Mpemba effect in the small diffusion limit of one-dimensional
overdamped Langevin dynamics on a double-well potential. The conditions depend
on the means of first passage times and energy and their pair correlation. Our
results agree with the experiment of Kumar and Bechhoeffer, which shows the
strong Mpemba effect occurs when the probability of being in a well at initial
and bath temperature matches.

<h3>Spatiotemporal Quenches in Long-Range Hamiltonians</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07499" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07499</a>
<br>
<i>Simon Bernier, Kartiek Agarwal</i>
<br>
<br>
Spatiotemporal quenches are efficient at preparing ground states of critical
Hamiltonians that have emergent low-energy descriptions with Lorentz
invariance. The critical transverse field Ising model with nearest neighbor
interactions, for instance, maps to free fermions with a relativistic low
energy dispersion. However, spin models realized in artificial quantum
simulators based on neutral Rydberg atoms, or trapped ions, generically exhibit
long range power-law decay of interactions with $J(r) \sim 1/r^\alpha$ for a
wide range of $\alpha$. In this work, we study the fate of spatiotemporal
quenches in these models with a fixed velocity $v$ for the propagation of the
quench front, using the numerical time-dependent variational principle. For
$\alpha \gtrsim 3$, where the critical theory is suggested to have a dynamical
critical exponent $z = 1$, our simulations show that optimal cooling is
achieved when the front velocity $v$ approaches $c$, the effective speed of
excitations in the critical model. The energy density is inhomogeneously
distributed in space, with prominent hot regions populated by excitations
co-propagating with the quench front, and cold regions populated by
counter-propagating excitations. Lowering $\alpha$ largely blurs the boundaries
between these regions. For $\alpha < 3$, we find that the Doppler cooling
effect disappears, as expected from renormalization group results for the
critical model which suggest a dispersion $\omega \sim q^z$ with $z < 1$.
Instead, we show that excitations are controlled by two relevant length scales
whose ratio is related to that of the front velocity to a threshold velocity
that ultimately determines the adiabaticity of the quench.

<h3>Competing magnetic fluctuations and orders in a multiorbital model of  doped SrCo$_2$As$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07511" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07511</a>
<br>
<i>Ana-Marija Nedić, Morten H. Christensen, Y. Lee, Bing Li, Benjamin G. Ueland, Rafael M. Fernandes, Robert J. McQueeney, Liqin Ke, Peter P. Orth</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the intriguing magnetic behavior of the paradigmatic itinerant
frustrated magnet $\rm{Sr}\rm{Co}_2\rm{As}_2$, which shows strong and competing
magnetic fluctuations yet does not develop long-range magnetic order. By
calculating the static spin susceptibility $\chi(\mathbf{q})$ within a
realistic sixteen orbital Hubbard-Hund model, we determine the leading
instability to be ferromagnetic (FM). We then explore the effect of doping and
calculate the critical Hubbard interaction strength $U_c$ that is required for
the development of magnetic order. We find that $U_c$ decreases under electron
doping and with increasing Hund's coupling $J$, but increases rapidly under
hole doping. This suggests that magnetic order could possibly emerge under
electron doping but not under hole doping, which agrees with experimental
findings. We map out the leading magnetic instability as a function of doping
and Hund's coupling and find several antiferromagnetic phases in addition to
FM. We also quantify the degree of itinerant frustration in the model and
resolve the contributions of different orbitals to the magnetic susceptibility.
Finally, we discuss the dynamic spin susceptibility, $\chi(\mathbf{q},
\omega)$, at finite frequencies, where we recover the anisotropy of the peaks
at $\mathbf{Q}_\pi = (\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \pi)$ observed by inelastic neutron
scattering that is associated with the phenomenon of itinerant magnetic
frustration. By comparing results between theory and experiment, we conclude
that the essential experimental features of doped SrCo$_2$As$_2$ are well
captured by a Hubbard-Hund multiorbital model if one considers a small shift of
the chemical potential towards hole doping.

<h3>Accuracy of ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson and dynamical mean  field theory as a function of the impurity-model bath size</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07515</a>
<br>
<i>Tsung-Han Leem Nicola Lanatà, Gabriel Kotliar</i>
<br>
<br>
We compare the accuracy of the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson
(g-RISB) theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) on the single-band
Hubbard model, as a function of the number of bath sites in the embedding
impurity Hamiltonian. Our benchmark calculations confirm that the accuracy of
g-RISB can be systematically improved by increasing the number of bath sites,
similar to DMFT. With a few bath sites, we observe that g-RISB is
systematically more accurate than DMFT for the ground-state observables. On the
other hand, the relative accuracy of these methods is generally comparable for
the quasiparticle weight and the spectral function (both at low and high
energies). As expected, we observe that g-RISB satisfies the variational
principle in infinite dimension, as the total energy decreases monotonically
towards the exact value as a function of the number of bath sites used. Our
results suggest that the g-RISB is a promising method for first principle
simulations of strongly correlated matter, which can capture the behavior of
both static and dynamical observables, at a relatively low computational cost.

<h3>Comparing the roles of time overhead and spatial dimensions on Brownian  processes with potential bias and stochastic resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07557" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07557</a>
<br>
<i>Saeed Ahmad, Dibyendu Das</i>
<br>
<br>
The strategy of stochastic resetting is known to expedite the first passage
to a target, in diffusive systems. Consequently, the mean first passage time is
minimised at an optimal resetting parameter. With Poisson resetting, continuous
and discontinuous transitions in the optimal resetting rate has been found for
various model systems, under the further influence of an external potential. In
this paper, we explore how the discontinuous transitions in this context, are
regulated by two other factors -- the first one is spatial dimensions within
which the diffusion is embedded, and the second is the time delay introduced
before restart. We investigate the effect of these factors by studying
analytically two types of models, one with an ordinary drift and another with a
barrier, and both types having two absorbing boundaries. In the case of barrier
potential, we find that the effect of increasing dimensions on the transitions,
is quite the opposite of increasing refractory period.

<h3>Distinguishing thixotropy, anti-thixotropy, and viscoelasticity using  hysteresis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07572" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07572</a>
<br>
<i>Yilin Wang, Randy H. Ewoldt</i>
<br>
<br>
Thixotropy, anti-thixotropy, and viscoelasticity are three types of
time-dependent dynamics that involve fundamentally different underlying
physical processes. Yet distinguishing them can be very challenging, which
hinders the understanding of structure-property relations. Here we show that
hysteresis is a promising technique to contrast the three dynamics by exploring
signatures of the most basic thixotropic, anti-thixotropic, and nonlinear
viscoelastic models. From these signatures, using shear-rate controlled ramps
that begin and end at high shear rates, we identify two distinguishing features
in hysteresis loops. The first is the direction of the hysteresis loops:
clockwise for thixotropy, but counterclockwise for viscoelasticity and
anti-thixotropy. A second feature is achieved at high ramping rates where all
responses lose hysteresis: the viscoelastic response shows a stress plateau at
low shear rates (lack of stress relaxation), whereas the thixotropic and
anti-thixotropic responses are purely viscous with minimal shear thinning or
thickening. The features are observed independent of the model details. We
establish further evidence for these signatures by experimentally measuring the
hysteresis of thixotropic Laponite suspensions, anti-thixotropic carbon black
suspensions, and viscoelastic poly (ethylene oxide) solutions. The protocols
explored here can be used to distinguish thixotropy, anti-thixotropy, and
viscoelasticity, which helps reveal the underlying microstructural physics of
complex fluids.

<h3>Electronic transport mechanisms in a thin crystal of the Kitaev  candidate $α$-RuCl$_3$ probed through guarded high impedance  measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07578</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick Barfield, Vinh Tran, Vikram Nagarajan, Maya Martinez, Amirari Diego, Derek Bergner, Alessandra Lanzara, James G. Analytis, Claudia Ojeda-Aristizabal</i>
<br>
<br>
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is considered to be the top candidate material for the
experimental realization of the celebrated Kitaev model, where ground states
are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with interesting fractionalized excitations. It
is however known that additional interactions beyond the Kitaev model trigger
in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a long-range zigzag antiferromagnetic ground state. In
this work, we investigate a nanoflake of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ through guarded high
impedance measurements aimed at reaching through electronic transport, the
regime where the system turns into a zigzag antiferromagnet. We investigated a
variety of temperatures (1.5 - 130 K) and out-of-plane magnetic fields ranging
up to 11 T, finding that there is a clear deviation from traditional transport
mechanisms such as variable range hopping (VRH) or thermal activation at
temperatures below the magnetic ordering transition. In particular, we find
that above that temperature ($\approx$7 K), transport is ruled by
Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH, becoming thermally activated at $\approx $30 K and
both mechanisms being suppressed below the critical temperature. ES-VRH is
consistent with the zero density of states at the Fermi level that we have
observed through our Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES)
measurements. Our work demonstrates the possibility of reaching through
specialized high impedance measurements the thrilling ground states predicted
for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ at low temperatures in the frame of the Kitaev model, and
informs about the transport mechanisms in this material in a wide temperature
range as well as on important characteristic quantities such as the
localization length.

<h3>Vanishing RKKY interactions in Ce-based cage compounds</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the results of thermodynamic measurements in external magnetic
field of the cubic Ce-based cage compounds Ce$T_{2}$Cd$_{20}$ ($T$ = Ni,Pd).
Our analysis of the heat-capacity data shows that the $\Gamma_7$ doublet is the
ground state multiplet of the Ce$^{3+}$ ions. Consequently, for the $\Gamma_7$
doublet it can be theoretically shown that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
(RKKY) interaction between the localized Ce moments mediated by the conduction
electrons, must vanish at temperatures much lower than the energy separating
the ground state doublet from the first excited $\Gamma_8$ quartet. Our
findings provide an insight as to why no long range order has been observed in
these compounds down to temperatures in the millikelvin range.

<h3>Strain-induced superconductivity in Sr2IrO4</h3>

<br>
<i>Lena Engström, Chia-Chuan Liu, William Witczak-Krempa, T. Pereg-Barnea</i>
<br>
<br>
Multi-orbital quantum materials with strong interactions can host a variety
of novel phases. In this work we study the possibility of interaction-driven
superconductivity in the iridate compound Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ under strain and
doping. We find numerous regimes of strain-induced superconductivity in which
the pairing structure depends on model parameters. Spin-fluctuation mediated
superconductivity is modeled by a Hubbard-Kanamori model with an effective
particle-particle interaction, calculated via the random phase approximation.
Magnetic orders are found using the Stoner criterion. The most likely
superconducting order we find has $d$-wave pairing, predominantly in the total
angular momentum, $J=1/2$ states. Moreover, an $s_{\pm}$-order which mixes
different bands is found at high Hund's coupling, and at high strain
anisotropic $s$- and $d$-wave orders emerge. Finally, we show that in a
fine-tuned region of parameters a spin-triplet $p$-wave order exists. The
combination of strong spin-orbit coupling, interactions, and a sensitivity of
the band structure to strain proves a fruitful avenue for engineering new
quantum phases.

<h3>Supersolidity and crystallization of a dipolar Bose gas in an infinite  tube</h3>

<br>
<i>Joseph C. Smith, D. Baillie, P. B. Blakie</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the ground states of a dipolar Bose gas confined in an infinite
tube potential. We use the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation theory and
present a novel numerical method to efficiently obtain solutions. A key feature
of this method is an analytic result for a truncated dipole-dipole interaction
potential that enables the long-ranged interactions to be accurately evaluated
within a unit cell. Our focus is on the transition of the ground state to a
crystal driven by dipole-dipole interactions as the short ranged interaction
strength is varied. We find that the transition is continuous or discontinuous
depending upon average system density. These results give deeper insight into
the supersolid phase transition observed in recent experiments, and validate
the utility of the reduced three-dimensional theory developed in [Phys. Rev.
Res. 2, 043318 (2020)] for making qualitatively accurate predictions.

<br>
The nature of complex eigenenergy enables unique band topology to the
non-Hermitian (NH) lattice systems. Recently, there has been a fast growing
interest in the elusive winding and braiding topologies of the NH single and
double bands, respectively. Here, we explore the even more intricate NH
multi-band topology and present the first experimental characterization of the
three-band braid relations by acoustic systems. Based on a concise
tight-binding model, we design a ternary cavity-tube structure equipped with a
highly controllable unidirectional coupler, through which the acoustic NH Bloch
bands are experimentally reproduced in a synthetic dimension. We identify the
NH three-band braid relations from both the perspectives of eigenvalues and
eigenstates, including a noncommutative braid relation and a swappable braid
relation. Our results could promote the understanding of NH Bloch band topology
and pave the way toward designing new devices for manipulating acoustic states.

Understanding the profile of a qubit's wavefunction is key to its quantum
applications. Unlike conducting systems, where a scanning tunneling microscope
can be used to probe the electron distribution, there is no direct method for
solid-state-defect based qubits in wide-bandgap semiconductors. In this work,
we use pressure as a tuning method and a nuclear spin as an atomic scale probe
to monitor the hyperfine structure of negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV)
centers in diamonds under pressure. We present a detailed study on the
nearest-neighbor $^{13}C$ hyperfine splitting in the optically detected
magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrum of NV centers at different pressures. By
examining the $^{13}C$ hyperfine interaction upon pressurizing, we show that
the NV hyperfine parameters have prominent changes, resulting in an increase in
the NV electron spin density and rehybridization from $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ bonds.
The $ab$ $initio$ calculations of strain dependence of the NV center's
hyperfine levels are done independently. The theoretical results qualitatively
agree well with experimental data without introducing any fitting parameters.
Furthermore, this method can be adopted to probe the evolution of wavefunction
in other defect systems. This potential capability could play an important role
in developing magnetometry and quantum information processing using the defect
centers.

Determining the nature of band gaps in transition-metal compounds remains
challenging. We present a first-principles study on electronic and optical
properties of CoO using hybrid functional pseudopotentials. We show that
optical absorption spectrum can provide a clear fingerprint to distinguish
between Mott-Hubbard, intermediate and charge-transfer insulators. This
discrimination is reflected by the qualitative difference in peak satellites
due to unique interplay between $d$-$d$ and $p$-$d$ excitations, thus allowing
identification from experimental data alone, unlike the existing methods that
require additional theoretical interpretation. We conclude that the CoO is an
intermediate, rather than a Mott-Hubbard insulator as is initially believed.

We report on single crystal growth of laser material Nd:YAG widely used in
the applications by innovative crucible-free floating zone method implemented
in an advanced laser optical furnace. We have optimized the parameters for the
production of high-quality single crystals of the size typical for laser tubes.
To reduce the strain and improve machinability, we have developed an
afterheater to thermalize the grown part of a single crystal below the hot
zone, which is a technique unavailable in common mirror furnaces. The high
quality of the single crystals was verified by Laue diffraction and the
internal strain was documented by neutron diffraction. The absorption spectrum
corresponds with the parameters of the commercially used material produced by
Czochralski method. The presented methodology for the single crystal growth by
floating zone method with laser heating is applicable for the preparation of
other high-quality single crystals of oxide-based materials, particularly in an
oxidizing environment unattainable in commonly used crucible methods.

Vertical van der Waals heterostructures of semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenides realize moir\'e systems with rich correlated electron phases
and moir\'e exciton phenomena. For material combinations with small lattice
mismatch and twist angles as in MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$, however, lattice
reconstruction eliminates the canonical moir\'e pattern and instead gives rise
to arrays of periodically reconstructed nanoscale domains and mesoscopically
extended areas of one atomic registry. Here, we elucidate the role of atomic
reconstruction in MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructures synthesized by chemical
vapor deposition. With complementary imaging down to the atomic scale,
simulations, and optical spectroscopy methods we identify the coexistence of
moir\'e-type cores and extended moir\'e-free regions in heterostacks with
parallel and antiparallel alignment. Our work highlights the potential of
chemical vapor deposition for applications requiring moir\'e-free uniform
systems and moir\'e-type exciton-confining arrays.

The Berry curvature plays a key role in the magnetic transport of topological
materials. Yet, it is not clear whether the Berry curvature by itself can give
rise to universal transport phenomena with specific scaling behaviors. In this
work, based on the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism and the symmetry analysis,
we show that the noncentrosymmetric distribution of the Berry curvature
generally results in linear magnetoresistivity and thermoconductivity both
exhibiting the B-scaling behavior. We then study such kind of topological
linear magnetoresistivity in the 2D MnBi2Te4 flakes and the 3D
spin-orbit-coupled electron gas, the former showing good agreement with the
experimental observations. The difference between our mechanism and the
conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance is elucidated. Our theory proposes a
universal scenario for the topological linear magnetoresistivity and
thermoconductivity and predicts such effects to occur in various materials,
which also provides a reasonable explanation for the recent observations of
linear magnetoresistivity.

We study the transient dynamics subject to quantum coherence effects of two
interacting parallel quantum dots weakly coupled to macroscopic leads. The
stationary particle current of this quantum system is sensitive to
perturbations much smaller than any other energy scale, specifically compared
to the system-lead coupling and the temperature. We show that this is due to
the presence of a parity-like symmetry in the dynamics, as a consequence of
which, two distinct stationary states arise. In the presence of small
perturbations breaking this symmetry, the system exhibits metastability with
two metastable phases that can be approximated by a combination of states
corresponding to stationary states in the unperturbed limit. Furthermore, the
long-time dynamics can be described as classical dynamics between those phases,
leading to a unique stationary state. In particular, the competition of those
two metastable phases explains the sensitive behavior of the stationary current
towards small perturbations. We show that this behavior bears the potential of
utilizing the parallel dots as a charge sensor which makes use of quantum
coherence effects to achieve a signal to noise ratio that is not limited by the
temperature. As a consequence, the parallel dots outperform an analogous
single-dot charge sensor for a wide range of temperatures.

Neuromorphic computing (NC) architecture has shown its suitability for
energy-efficient computation. Amongst several systems, spin-orbit torque (SOT)
based domain wall (DW) devices are one of the most energy-efficient contenders
for NC. To realize spin-based NC architecture, the computing elements such as
synthetic neurons and synapses need to be developed. However, there are very
few experimental investigations on DW neurons and synapses. The present study
demonstrates the energy-efficient operations of neurons and synapses by using
novel reading and writing strategies. We have used a W/CoFeB-based
energy-efficient SOT mechanism to drive the DWs at low current densities. We
have used the concept of meander devices for achieving synaptic functions. By
doing this, we have achieved 9 different resistive states in experiments. We
have experimentally demonstrated the functional spike and step neurons.
Additionally, we have engineered the anomalous Hall bars by incorporating
several pairs, in comparison to conventional Hall crosses, to increase the
sensitivity as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We performed micromagnetic
simulations and transport measurements to demonstrate the above-mentioned
functionalities.

<h3>Bilinear Majorana representations for spin operators with spin  magnitudes $S>1/2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a classification of bilinear Majorana representations for spin-$S$
operators, based on the real irreducible matrix representations of SU(2). We
identify two types of such representations: While the first type can be
straightforwardly mapped onto standard complex fermionic representations of
spin-$S$ operators, the second type realizes spin amplitudes $S=s(s+1)/4$ with
$s\in\mathbb{N}$ and can be considered particularly efficient in representing
spins via fermions. We show that for $s=1$ and $s=2$ this second type
reproduces known spin-$1/2$ and spin-$3/2$ Majorana representations and we
prove that these are the only bilinear Majorana representations that do not
introduce any unphysical spin sectors. While for $s>2$, additional unphysical
spin spaces are unavoidable they are less numerous than for more standard
complex fermionic representations and carry comparatively small spin
amplitudes. We apply our Majorana representations to exactly solvable small
spin clusters and confirm that their low energy properties remain unaffected by
unphysical spin sectors, making our representations useful for
auxiliary-particle based methods.

<br>
<br>
The stimulated emission of exciton-polaritons was proposed as a means of
lowering the lasing threshold because it does not require the dissociation of
excitons to obtain an electron-hole plasma, as in a classical semiconductor
laser based on population inversion. In this work we propose a method to prove
unambiguously the polaritonic nature of lasing by combining experimental
measurements with a model accounting for the permittivity change as a function
of the carrier density. To do so we use angle resolved photoluminescence to
observe the lasing at cryogenic temperature from a polariton mode in a zinc
oxide waveguide structure, and to monitor the continuous shift of the
polaritonic dispersion towards a photonic dispersion as the optical intensity
of the pump is increased (up to 20 times the one at threshold). This shift is
reproduced thanks to a model taking into account the reduction of the
oscillator strength and the renormalization of the bandgap due to the screening
of the electrostatic interaction between electrons and holes. Furthermore, the
measurement of the carriers lifetime at optical intensities in the order of
those at which the polariton lasing occurs enables us to estimate the carrier
density, confirming it is lower than the corresponding Mott density for zinc
oxide reported in the literature.

<h3>Exploration of all-3d Heusler alloys for permanent magnets: an ab initio  based high-throughput study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Heusler alloys have attracted interest in various fields of functional
materials since their properties can quite easily be tuned by composition.
Here, we have investigated the relatively new class of all-3d Heusler alloys in
view of its potential as permanent magnets. To identify suitable candidates, we
performed a high-throughput study using an electronic structure database to
search for X$_2$YZ-type Heusler systems with tetragonal symmetry and high
magnetization. For the alloys which passed our selection filters, we have used
a combination of density functional theory calculations and spin dynamics
modelling to investigate their magnetic properties including the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and exchange interactions. The candidates
which fulfilled all the search criteria served as input for the investigation
of the temperature dependence of the magnetization and determination of Curie
temperature. Based on our results, we suggest that Fe$_2$NiZn, Fe$_2$NiTi and
Ni$_2$CoFe are potential candidates for permanent magnets with large
out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy (1.23, 0.97 and 0.82 MJ/m$^3$ respectively)
and high Curie temperatures lying more than 200 K above the room temperature.
We further show that the magnitude and direction of anisotropy is very
sensitive to the strain by calculating the values of anisotropy energy for
several tetragonal phases. Thus, application of strain can be used to tune the
anisotropy in these compounds.

We quantitatively characterize the metastability in a multi-phase lattice
Boltzmann model. The structure factor of density fluctuations is theoretically
obtained and numerically verified to a high precision, for all simulated
wave-vectors and reduced temperatures. The static structure factor is found to
consistently diverge as the temperature approaches the critical-point or the
density approaches the spinodal line at a sub-critical temperature.
Theoretically predicted critical exponents are observed in both cases. Finally,
the phase separation in the unstable branch follows the same pattern, i.e. the
generation of interfaces with different topology, as observed in molecular
dynamics simulations. All results can be independently reproduced through the
``idea.deploy" framework https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy

The electronic structure of rhombohedral sp2 hybridized boron nitride (r-BN)
is characterized by X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy.
Measurements are performed at the boron and nitrogen K-edges (1s) and
interpreted with first-principles density functional theory calculations,
including final state effects by applying a core-hole. We show that it is
possible to distinguish between different 2D planar polytypes such as
rhombohedral, twinned rhombohedral, hexagonal and turbostratic BN by the
difference in chemical shifts. In particular, the chemical shift at the B
1s-edge is shown to be significant for the turbostratic polytype. This implies
that the band gap can be tuned by a superposition of different polytypes and
stacking of lattice planes.

<h3>Dynamics of a spherical self-propelled tracer in a polymeric medium:  interplay of self-propulsion, stickiness, and crowding</h3>

<br>
<br>
We employ computer simulations to study the dynamics of a self-propelled
spherical tracer particle in a viscoelastic medium, made of a long polymer
chain. Here, the interplay between viscoelasticity, stickiness, and activity
(self-propulsion) brings additional complexity to the tracer dynamics. Our
simulation shows that on increasing the stickiness of the tracer particle to
the polymer beads, the dynamics of the tracer particle slows down as it gets
stuck to the polymer chain, and moves along with it. But with increasing the
self-propulsion velocity, the dynamics gets enhanced. In case of increasing
stickiness as well as activity, the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP) exhibits
non-monotonic behavior, which also shows up in the re-scaled self part of the
van-Hove function. Non-Gaussianity results owing to the enhanced binding
events, and the sticky motion of the tracer along with the chain with
increasing stickiness. On the other hand, with increasing activity, initially
non-Gaussianity increases as the tracer moves through the heterogenous
polymeric environment but for higher activity, escapes resulting negative NGP.
For higher values of stickiness, the trapping time distributions of the passive
tracer particle broadens and have long tails. On the other hand, for a given
stickiness with increasing self-propulsion force, the same becomes narrower and
have short tails. We believe that our current simulation study will be helpful
in elucidating the complex motion of activity-driven probes in viscoelastic
media.

<br>
<br>
We report the discovery of a novel skyrmion phase in the multiferroic
insulator Cu2OSeO3 for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket.
This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample out of equilibrium with
near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulses but can not be reached by any
conventional field cooling protocol. From the strong wavelength dependence of
the photocreation process and via spin dynamics simulations, we identify the
magnetoelastic effect as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect
results in a transient modification of the magnetic interaction extending the
equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. Once created, the
skyrmions rearrange and remain stable over a long time, reaching minutes. The
presented results are relevant for designing high-efficiency non-volatile data
storage based on magnetic skyrmions.

Quantum-disordered models provide a versatile platform to explore the
emergence of quantum excitations in many-body systems. The engineering of spin
models at the atomic scale with scanning tunneling microscopy and the local
imaging of excitations with electrically driven spin resonance has risen as a
powerful strategy to image spin excitations in finite quantum spin systems.
Here, focusing on $S=1/2$ lattices as realized by TiH in MgO, we show that
dynamical spin excitations provide a robust strategy to infer the nature of the
underlying Hamiltonian. We show that finite-size interference of the dynamical
many-body spin excitations of a generalized long-range Heisenberg model allows
the underlying spin couplings to be inferred. We show that the spatial
distribution of local spin excitations in TiH islands and ladders directly
correlates with the underlying ground state in the thermodynamic limit. Using a
supervised learning algorithm, we demonstrate that the different parameters of
the Hamiltonian can be extracted by providing the spatially and
frequency-dependent local excitations that can be directly measured by
electrically driven spin resonance with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our
results put forward local dynamical excitations in confined quantum spin models
as versatile witnesses of the underlying ground state, providing an
experimentally robust strategy for Hamiltonian inference in complex real spin
models.

Equilibrium physical properties of the solid and liquid phases of
parahydrogen, computed by first principle computer simulations, are compared
for different choices of pairwise, spherically symmetric intermolecular
potentials. The most recent ab initio potential [Patkowski et al., J. Chem.
Phys., 2008, 129, 094304], which has a stiffer repulsive core than the commonly
used Silvera-Goldman, yields results for structural quantities in better
agreement with the most recent experimental measurements, while possibly
overestimating the kinetic energy per molecule by as much as 10%. Altogether,
the comparison between theory and the available experimental evidence suggests
that the potential of Patkowski et al. may be a better choice for simulations
of condensed phases of parahydrogen at moderate pressure.

<br>
<br>
The thermo-mechanical coupling mechanism of graphene fracture under thermal
gradients possesses rich applications whereas hard to study due to its coupled
non-equilibrium nature. We employ non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to study
the fracture of graphene by applying a fixed strain rate under different
thermal gradients by employing different potential fields. It is found that for
AIREBO and AIREBO-M the fracture stresses do not strictly follow the positive
correlations with the initial crack length. Strain-hardening effects are
observed for "REBO-based" potential models of small initial defects, which is
interpreted as blunting effect observed for porous graphene. The temperature
gradients are observed to not show clear relations with the fracture stresses
and crack propagation dynamics. Quantized fracture mechanics verifies our
molecular dynamics calculations. We provide a unique perspective that the
transverse bond forces share the loading to account for the nonlinear increase
of fracture stress with shorter crack length. Anomalous kinetic energy
transportation along crack tips is observed for "REBO-based" potential models,
which we attribute to the high interatomic attractions in the potential models.
The fractures are honored to be more "brittle-liked" carried out using machine
learning interatomic potential (MLIP), yet incapable of simulating
post-fracture dynamical behaviors. The mechanical responses using MLIP are
observed to be not related to temperature gradients. The temperature
configuration of equilibration simulation employing the dropout uncertainty
neural network potential with a dropout rate of 0.2 is reported to be the most
accurate compared with the rest. This work is expected to inspire further
investigation of non-equilibrium dynamics in graphene with practical
applications in various engineering fields.

Polar discontinuities and structural changes at oxide interfaces give rise to
a large variety of unusual electronic and ionic phenomena. Related effects have
been studied intensively in epitaxial systems, including ferroelectric domain
walls and interfaces in superlattices. Here, we study the impact of polar
discontinuities on the local chemistry at grain boundaries in a polycrystalline
ferroelectric. By performing atom probe tomography measurements on the model
system ErMnO3, we find an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at
charged grain boundaries. In addition, impurity atoms accumulate at the grain
boundaries. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that
exceeds possible polarization-driven effects, demonstrating that structural
phenomena and chemical grain-to-grain variations rather than electrostatics
determine the local chemical composition. The study thus shows that the charged
grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving
new opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

<br>
Electronic nematicity that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry has been
shown as a generic phenomenon in correlated quantum systems including
high-temperature superconductors and the AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) family with a
kagome network. Identifying the driving force has been a central challenge for
understanding nematicity. In iron-based superconductors, the problem is
complicated because the spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom are
intimately coupled. In vanadium-based kagome superconductors AV3Sb5, the
electronic nematicity exhibits an intriguing entanglement with the charge
density wave order (CDW), making understanding its origin difficult. Recently,
a new family of titanium-based kagome superconductors ATi3Bi5 has been
synthesized. In sharp contrast to its vanadium-based counterpart, the
electronic nematicity occurs in the absence of CDW. ATi3Bi5 provides a new
window to explore the mechanism of electronic nematicity and its interplay with
the orbital degree of freedom. Here, we combine polarization-dependent
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory to
directly reveal the band topology and orbital characters of the multi-orbital
RbTi3Bi5. The promising coexistence of flat bands, type-II Dirac nodal line and
nontrivial Z2 topological states is identified in RbTi3Bi5. Remarkably, our
study clearly unveils the orbital character change along the G-M and G-K
directions, implying a strong intrinsic inter-orbital coupling in the Ti-based
kagome metals, reminiscent of iron-based superconductors. Furthermore,
doping-dependent measurements directly uncover the orbital-selective features
in the kagome bands, which can be well explained by the d-p hybridization. The
suggested d-p hybridization, in collaboration with the inter-orbital coupling,
could account for the electronic nematicity in ATi3Bi5.

Despite being a staple of synthetic plastics and biomolecules, helical
polymers are scarcely studied with Gaussian-basis-set ab initio
electron-correlated methods on an equal footing with molecules. This article
introduces an ab initio second-order Green's-function [MBGF(2)] method with
nondiagonal, frequency-dependent Dyson self-energy for infinite helical
polymers using screw-axis-symmetry-adapted Gaussian-spherical-harmonics basis
functions. Together with the Gaussian-basis-set density-functional theory for
energies, analytical atomic forces, translational-period force, and
helical-angle force, it can compute correlated energy, quasiparticle energy
bands, structures, and vibrational frequencies of an infinite helical polymer,
which smoothly converge at the corresponding oligomer results. We apply these
methods to polyethylene ($2/1$ helix), polyacetylene (Peierls' system), and
polytetrafluoroethylene ($13/6$ helix) to establish the quantitative accuracy
of MBGF(2)/cc-pVDZ in simulating their (angle-resolved) ultraviolet
photoelectron spectra, and of B3LYP/cc-pVDZ or 6-31G** in reproducing their
structures, infrared and Raman band positions, phonon dispersions, and
(coherent and incoherent) inelastic neutron scattering spectra. We then predict
the same properties for infinitely catenated chains of nitrogen or oxygen and
discuss their possible metastable existence under ambient conditions. They
include planar zigzag polyazene (N$_2$)$_x$ (Peierls' system), $11/3$-helical
isotactic polyazane (NH)$_x$, $9/4$-helical isotactic polyfluoroazane (NF)$_x$,

strongly coupled two-dimensional polaritonic lattices. Ubiquitous in
polaritonic experiments, the theoretical description of NPSF, remains limited
to perturbative treatment and homogeneous samples. In this study, we go beyond
the existing theoretical description and discover the broad scope of regimes
where NPSF crucially modifies the optical response. Studying the effects of
non-bosonicity, cooperative light-matter coupling, and Coulomb blockade, we
reveal several regimes for observing the nonlinear Rabi splitting quench due to
the phase space filling. Unlike prior studies, we derive nonlinear Rabi
frequency scaling all the way to the saturation limit and show that the
presence of a lattice potential leads to qualitatively distinct nonlinearity.
We concentrate on three regimes of NPSF: 1) planar; 2) fractured; and 3)
ultralocalized. In planar saturation, the Rabi frequency decreases
exponentially as a function of exciton density. For the fractured case, where
excitons form a lattice with sites exceeding the exciton size, we discover fast
NPSF at low occupation in the lattice. This is followed by slower NPSF as the
medium becomes fully saturated. This behavior is particularly pronounced in the
presence of Coulomb (or Rydberg) blockade, where regions of fast and slow NPSF
depend on the strength of repulsion. For the ultralocalized NPSF, we observe
the square-root saturation typical to the collection of two-level systems. Our
findings can help describing recent observations of strong nonlinearity in
heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides where Moir{\'e} lattices
emerge naturally [Nature \textbf{591}, 61 (2021)]. The theory also opens the
prospects for engineering strongly nonlinear responses of polaritonic lattices
with patterned samples, driving polaritonics into the quantum regime.

<h3>Fermi energy determination for advanced smearing techniques</h3>

Smearing techniques are widely used in first-principles calculations of
metallic and magnetic materials, where they improve the accuracy of Brillouin
zone sampling and lessen the impact of level-crossing instabilities. Smearing
introduces a fictitious electronic temperature that smooths the discontinuities
of the integrands; consequently, a corresponding fictitious entropic term
arises, and needs to be considered in the total free energy functional.
Advanced smearing techniques -- such as Methfessel-Paxton and cold smearing --
have been introduced to guarantee that the system's total free energy remains
independent of the smearing temperature at least up to the second order. In
doing so, they give rise to non-monotonic occupation functions (and, for
Methfessel-Paxton, non-positive definite), which can result in the chemical
potential not being uniquely defined. We explore this shortcoming in detail and
introduce a numerical protocol utilizing Newton's minimization method that is
able to identify the desired Fermi energy. We validate the method by
calculating the Fermi energy of $\sim$20,000 materials and comparing it with
the results of standard bisection approaches. In passing, we also highlight how
traditional approaches, based on Fermi-Dirac or Gaussian smearing, are actually
equivalent for all practical purposes, provided the smearing width is
appropriately renormalized by a factor $\sim$2.565.

Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) provide an efficient dynamical coupling between
strain and magnetization in micro/nano-metric devices. Using a hybrid device
composed of a piezoelectric, GaAs, and a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy thin film,
Fe$_3$Si, we are able to quantify the amplitude of magnetoacoustic waves
generated with SAWs via magnetic imaging in an X-ray photoelectron microscope.
The cubic anisotropy of the sample together with a low damping coefficient
allows for the observation of resonant and non-resonant magnetoelastic
coupling. Additionally, via micromagnetic simulation, we verify the
experimental behavior and quantify the magnetoelastic shear strain component in
Fe$_3$Si that appears to be very large ($b_2=14\times 10^6$ J/m$^3$), much
larger than the one found in Nickel.

<h3>Tuning the nuclei-induced spin relaxation of localized electrons by the  quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects</h3>

Quantum measurement back action is fundamentally unavoidable when
manipulating electron spins. Here we demonstrate that this back action can be
efficiently exploited to tune the spin relaxation of localized electrons
induced by the hyperfine interaction. In optical pump-probe experiments,
powerful probe pulses suppress the spin relaxation of electrons on Si donors in
an InGaAs epilayer due to the quantum Zeno effect. By contrast, an increase of
the probe power leads to a speed up of the spin relaxation for electrons in
InGaAs quantum dots due to the quantum anti-Zeno effect. The microscopic
description shows that the transition between the two regimes occurs when the
spin dephasing time is comparable to the probe pulse repetition period.

The noncentrosymmetric NbReSi superconductor with $T_{c} \simeq 6.5$ K is
characterized by the relatively large upper critical magnetic field. Its
multigap features were observed experimentally. Recent studies suggested
realization of P$\bar{6}$2m or Ima2 symmetry. We discuss the dynamical
properties of both symmetries (e.g., phonon spectra). In this paper, using the
ab initio techniques, we clarify this ambiguity, and conclude that the Ima2
symmetry is unstable, and P$\bar{6}$2m should be realized. The P$\bar{6}$2m
symmetry is also stable in the presence of external hydrostatic pressure. We
show that NbReSi with the P$\bar{6}$2m symmetry should host phonon surface
states for (100) and (110) surfaces. Additionally, we discuss the main
electronic properties of the system with the stable symmetry.

Single magnetic molecules may be the smallest functional magnets. An
electric-field controllable spin state of magnetic molecules is of fundamental
importance for applications while its realization remains challenging. To date
the observed spin-electric interaction based on spin-orbit coupling or spin
dipole coupling is useful to tune fine spin structures but too weak to flip the
spin state. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to realize enhanced
spin-electric coupling and flip the spin states by tuning the spin
superexchange between local spins. Using first-principles calculations and
Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate this effect in a family of magnetic
molecules, transition metallic Porphyrins. We show that their d-{\pi} and
{\pi}-{\pi} spin superexchange couplings are determined by the relative
energies of d and {\pi} electronic states, which are sensitive to the applied
electric field. Therefore, applying electric field can tune a wide range of
magnetic ground states, including ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and
antiferromagnetic configurations. This spin-electric coupling may provide a new
approach for designing and controlling molecular spintronics.

<h3>Emergent flat band and topological Kondo semimetal driven by  orbital-selective correlations</h3>

Flat electronic bands are expected to show proportionally enhanced electron
correlations, which may generate a plethora of novel quantum phases and unusual
low-energy excitations. They are increasingly being pursued in
$d$-electron-based systems with crystalline lattices that feature destructive
electronic interference, where they are often topological. Such flat bands,
though, are generically located far away from the Fermi energy, which limits
their capacity to partake in the low-energy physics. Here we show that electron
correlations produce emergent flat bands that are pinned to the Fermi energy.
We demonstrate this effect within a Hubbard model, in the regime described by
Wannier orbitals where an effective Kondo description arises through
orbital-selective Mott correlations. Moreover, the correlation effect
cooperates with symmetry constraints to produce a topological Kondo semimetal.
Our results motivate a novel design principle for Weyl Kondo semimetals in a
new setting, viz. $d$-electron-based materials on suitable crystal lattices,
and uncover interconnections among seemingly disparate systems that may inspire
fresh understandings and realizations of correlated topological effects in
quantum materials and beyond.

<h3>Topological phase transitions for any taste in 2D quasiperiodic systems</h3>

In this paper we explore the effects of quasiperiodicity in paradigmatic
models of Chern insulators. We identify a plethora of topological phase
transitions and characterize them based on spectral and localization
properties. Contrary to uncorrelated disorder, gap closing and reopening
topological transitions can be induced by quasiperiodicity. These can separate
widely different phases, including (i) trivial and Chern insulators, both with
ballistic states near the gap edges; (ii) Chern insulators with critical states
around the gap edges or (iii) Chern and trivial insulators respectively with
ballistic and localized gap-edge states. Transition (i) is similar to
clean-limit topological transitions due to the ballistic character of the
gap-edge states, but at the same time resembles (quasi)disorder driven
topological Anderson insulator phenomena. On the other hand, transitions (ii)
and (iii) have no clean-limit counterpart. Additionally, quasiperiodicity can
also induce topological transitions into a trivial state for which the gap
closes and does not reopen, a scenario that resembles more what is observed
with uncorrelated disorder. However, we found that such transitions can also be
non-conventional in that they can be accompanied by the emergence of
intermediate metallic and critical phases where the Chern number is not
quantized. Our results show that a rich variety of topological phase
transitions, not previously realized experimentally nor predicted theoretically
can be attained when applying quasiperiodic modulations to simple Chern
insulators. Such models have previously been realized experimentally in widely
different platforms, including in optical lattices and photonic or acoustic
media, where quasiperiodicity effects can be incorporated. The unveiled
topological phase transitions can in principle be observed experimentally with
state-of-the-art techniques.

<h3>Watching the seeds of dynamical phase transitions: the complex-time  survival amplitude</h3>

Dynamical phase transitions are defined through non-analyticities of the
survival probability of an out-of-equilibrium time-evolving state at certain
critical times. They ensue from zeros of the corresponding survival amplitude.
By extending the time variable onto the complex domain, we formulate the
complex-time survival amplitude. The complex zeros of this quantity near the
time axis correspond, in the infinite-size limit, to non-analytical points
where the survival probability abruptly vanishes. Our results are numerically
exemplified in the fully-connected transverse-field Ising model, which displays
a symmetry-broken phase delimited by an excited-state quantum phase transition.
A detailed study of the behavior of the complex-time survival amplitude when
the characteristics of the out-of-equilibrium protocol changes is presented.
The influence of the excited-state quantum phase transition is also put into
context.

<h3>Dynamic metal along grain boundaries in Floquet topological crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Driven quantum materials often feature emergent topology, otherwise absent in
static crystals. Dynamic bulk-boundary correspondence, encoded by
nondissipative gapless modes residing near the Floquet zone center and/or
boundaries, is the most prominent example of such phenomena. Here we show that
topologically robust gapless matallic states appear along the grain boundaries,
embedded in the interior of Floquet topological crystals, when the
Floquet-Bloch band inversion occurring at a finite momentum (${\bf K}^{\rm
Flq}_{\rm inv}$) and the Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) of the constituting array
of dislocations satisfy ${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo
$2 \pi$). Such dissipationless metallic states can be found near the center
and/or edge of the Floquet Brillouin zone, irrespective of the drive protocol.
We showcase these general outcomes for two-dimensional driven time-reversal
symmetry breaking insulators. Promising experimental platforms, unveiling such
dynamic topological metals in real materials, are discussed.

We provide an overview of the effects of interactions in Bose-condensed
gases. We focus on phenomena that have been explored in ultracold atom
experiments, covering both tuneable contact interactions and dipolar
interactions. Our discussion includes: modifications to the ground state and
excitation spectrum, critical behaviour near the Bose--Einstein condensation
temperature, the unitary regime where the interactions are as strong as allowed
by quantum mechanics, quantum droplets in mixtures, and supersolids in dipolar
gases.
