A Markov state model is a powerful tool that can be used to track the
evolution of populations of configurations in an atomistic representation of a
protein. For a coarse-grained linear chain model with discontinuous
interactions, the transition rates among states that appear in the Markov model
when the monomer dynamics is diffusive can be determined by computing the
relative entropy of states and their mean first passage times, quantities that
are unchanged by the specification of the energies of the relevant states. In
this paper, we verify the folding dynamics described by a diffusive linear
chain model of the crambin protein under three distinct solvent systems, each
differing in complexity: a hard-sphere solvent, a solvent undergoing
multi-particle collision dynamics, and an implicit solvent model. The predicted
transition rates among configurations agree quantitatively with those observed
in explicit molecular dynamics simulations for all three solvent models. These
results suggest that the local monomer-monomer interactions provide sufficient
friction for the monomer dynamics to be diffusive on timescales relevant to
changes in conformation. Factors such as structural ordering and dynamic
hydrodynamic effects appear to have minimal influence on transition rates
within the studied solvent densities.

The statistical-physical study of granular matter is essential to understand,
from a fundamental point of view, the many different phenomena emerging in
these classical many-body systems. Under rapid-flow conditions, granular
materials exhibit a gas-like behavior, which can be described from the kinetic
theory of gases. However, unlike molecular gases, a granular gas dissipates
energy upon particle collisions, thus being completely out of equilibrium.
Then, whereas the simplest model for a molecular gas consists in a collection
of elastic hard spheres, a granular gas is simply described by inelastic hard
spheres, which is usually improved by the consideration of surface roughness in
the particles. Moreover, a granular gas can be found in free evolution,
externally driven, or even immersed in an interstitial fluid. In this work, the
description of the dynamics of granular gases has been carried out with the aim
of identifying the specific properties emerging from the model by considering
the surface roughness of granular particles. For that end, we have used the
Boltzmann equation, adding in the driven and suspension cases a
Fokker--Planck-like term. The main objectives of this thesis have been the
theoretical description of the homogeneous states of the considered models, as
well as the study of memory effects emerging from out-of-equilibrium states,
and, finally, the transport properties and the appearance of instabilities in
the hydrodynamic description of a granular gas of inelastic and rough
particles. All these kinetic-theory analyses have been supplemented with
computer simulations from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics algorithms.

Inspired by the root systems of Lie algebras of rank 2, we propose a
mathematical method to engineer new 2D materials with double periodic
structures tessellating the plane. Concretely, we investigate two geometries
relaying on squares and hexagons exhibiting D4 D4 and D6 D6 dihedral group
invariances, respectively. Due to lack of empirical verifications of such
double configurations, we provide a numerical investigation by help of the open
source quantum espresso. Motivated by hybrid structures of graphene, silicene,
germanene, we investigate two models involving D4 D4 and D6 D6 dihedral
symmetries which we refer to as Si4Ge4 and Si6C6 compounds, respectively. For
simplicities, we study only the opto-electronic physical properties by applying
an electromagnetic source propagating in linear and isotropic mediums. We
believe that the Lie algebra inspiration of such 2D material studies, via
density functional theory techniques, could open new roads to think about
higher dimensional cases by implementing generalized Cartan matrices.

Two-dimensional semiconductors, known as Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
(TMDCs), are of great interest among many materials due to their unique 2D
characteristics, including exceptional electronic and optical properties. These
compounds belong to the family of lamellar materials having a general formula
of type $MX_2$, where M represents a transition metal belonging to one of
groups IV, V, or VI of Mendeleev's periodic table, and X is a chalcogenide.
These materials exhibit fundamental properties that are qualitatively different
from their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, often relating to their
electronic and phononic band structure. The in-depth study of these materials
has revealed remarkable phenomena, such as two-dimensional quantum phase
transitions and optoelectronic phenomena related to electronic "valleys", which
exploit the wavevector selectivity of the emission and the absorption of
photons. Unlike graphene, materials such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and
WSe$_2$ are semiconductors that have a bandgap varying from 1.2 to 1.9 electron
volts (eV), depending on the number of layers. This characteristic makes them
suitable for use as active elements in optoelectronic devices. Additionally,
their two-dimensional nature and mechanical strength enable the realization of
quantum phase transitions and electronic components on flexible substrates. It
is also possible to create quantum wells based on MoS$_2$, with materials such
as MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, depending on the band shift between the
components of the quantum well.
This work aims to propose a theoretical and numerical model for these
materials, which will make it possible to determine the electronic band
structure as well as the optical gain in an active zone composed of
two-dimensional semiconductors. This research is of great importance for
evaluating the performance of active zones in laser devices based on these
materials.

The potential leakage of nuclear waste, especially radioiodine, is a major
safety concerning issue around the world. To remove radioiodine from nuclear
waste efficiently, there is an urgent demand for adsorbents that possess both
high stability and strong adsorption affinity for environmental remediation.
Herein, two Zr-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) and their
N-functionalized analogues have been synthesized and researched for iodine
adsorption in both vapours and solutions. It was found that Zr-MOFs with
N-enriched ligands (e.g., pyridine and amino) exhibited the faster iodine
adsorption rate and the higher iodine uptake amount (e.g., reaching adsorption
equilibrium within 4 hours with the removal rate of above 85% for iodine
solution adsorption) than their unfunctionalized counterparts (UiO-66 and
UiO-67). The critical role played by N-enriched groups in enhancing iodine
adsorption has been revealed through versatile model fittings, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy characterizations, as
well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Compared to those in
amino-group, the N-atoms in pyridine-groups showed a deeper affinity towards
iodine molecules. Remarkably, the N-enriched UiOs adsorbents also exhibited
good recyclability, especially UiO-66-PYDC and UiO-67-NH2 could maintain the
removal efficiency of 89.05% and 85.49% after four adsorption-desorption
recycling tests. With the strong iodine uptake affinity and outstanding
regeneration performance, this work has systematically investigated the impact
of N-functionalization on the enhanced performance for iodine capture by using
the N-enriched UiO MOFs as promising adsorbents, providing an insightful
guideline into the physical chemistry of adsorption mechanism behind the
radioiodine capture.

A unidirectional "density" wave order in an otherwise isotropic environment
is guaranteed to display smectic-like Goldstone mode. Examples of such "soft"
states include conventional smectic liquid crystals, putative
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluids, and helical states of frustrated
bosons and spins. Here we develop generalized spin-smectic $\sigma$-models that
break $O(N)$ internal symmetry in addition to the $d$-dimensional rotational
and uniaxial translational symmetries. We explore long-wavelength properties of
such strongly fluctuating states, show that they are characterized by a
"double-power-law" static structure peak, and analyze their asymptotic
symmetry-reduced crossover to conventional low-energy modes. We also present
the associated Ginzburg-Landau theory, describing phase transition into such
spin-smectic states, and discuss experimental realization of such models.

The development of large databases of material properties, together with the
availability of powerful computers, has allowed machine learning (ML) modeling
to become a widely used tool for predicting material performances. While
confidence intervals are commonly reported for such ML models, prediction
intervals, i.e., the uncertainty on each prediction, are not as frequently
available. Here, we investigate three easy-to-implement approaches to determine
such individual uncertainty, comparing them across ten ML quantities spanning
energetics, mechanical, electronic, optical, and spectral properties.
Specifically, we focused on the Quantile approach, the direct machine learning
of the prediction intervals and Ensemble methods.

Expanding the pool of stable halide perovskites with attractive
optoelectronic properties is crucial to addressing current limitations in their
performance as photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. In this article, we demonstrate how
a high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) dataset of halide perovskite
alloys can be used to train accurate surrogate models for property prediction
and subsequently perform inverse design using genetic algorithm (GA). Our
dataset consists of decomposition energies, band gaps, and photovoltaic
efficiencies of nearly 800 pure and mixed composition ABX$_3$ compounds from
both the GGA-PBE and HSE06 functionals, and are combined with ~ 100
experimental data points collected from the literature. Multi-fidelity random
forest regression models are trained on the DFT + experimental dataset for each
property using descriptors that one-hot encode composition, phase, and
fidelity, and additionally include well-known elemental or molecular properties
of species at the A, B, and X sites. Rigorously optimized models are deployed
for experiment-level prediction over > 150,000 hypothetical compounds, leading
to thousands of promising materials with low decomposition energy, band gap
between 1 and 2 eV, and efficiency > 15%. Surrogate models are further combined
with GA using an objective function to maintain chemical feasibility, minimize
decomposition energy, maximize PV efficiency, and keep band gap between 1 and 2
eV; hundreds more optimal compositions and phases are thus discovered. We
present an analysis of the screened and inverse-designed materials, visualize
ternary phase diagrams generated for many systems of interest using ML
predictions, and suggest strategies for further improvement and expansion in
the future.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have drawn immense interest in scientific and
technological communities, owing to their extraordinary properties that are
profoundly altered from their bulk counterparts and their enriched tunability
by gating, proximity, strain, and external fields. For digital applications, an
ideal 2D material would have high mobility, air stability, sizable band gap,
and be compatible with large-scale synthesis. Here we demonstrate air-stable
field-effect transistors using atomically thin few-layer PdSe2 sheets that are
sandwiched between hexagonal BN (hBN), with record high saturation current
>350{\mu}A/{\mu}m, and field effect mobilities 700 and 10,000 cm2/Vs at 300K
and 2K, respectively. At low temperatures, magnetotransport studies reveal
unique octets in quantum oscillations, arising from 2-fold spin and 4-fold
valley degeneracies, which can be broken by in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic
fields toward quantum Hall spin and orbital ferromagnetism.

Recently, large degeneracy based on product eigenstates has been found in

liquids, anyonic phases, and quantum scars. We unify these systems by a
complete classification of product eigenstates of Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonians
with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on general graphs in the form of
Kirchhoff rules for spin supercurrent. By this, we construct spin systems with
extensive degree of degeneracy linked to exotic condensates which can be
studied in atomic gases and quantum spin lattices.

BaNi$_2$As$_2$ is a structural analog of the pnictide superconductor
BaFe$_2$As$_2$, which, like the iron-based superconductors, hosts a variety of
ordered phases including charge density waves (CDWs), electronic nematicity,
and superconductivity. Upon isovalent Sr substitution on the Ba site, the
charge and nematic orders are suppressed, followed by a sixfold enhancement of
the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$). To understand the
mechanisms responsible for enhancement of $T_c$, we present high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the
Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$As$_2$ series, which agree well with our density
functional theory (DFT) calculations throughout the substitution range.
Analysis of our ARPES-validated DFT results indicates a Lifshitz transition and
reasonably nested electron and hole Fermi pockets near optimal substitution
where $T_c$ is maximum. These nested pockets host Ni $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ orbital
compositions, which we associate with the enhancement of nematic fluctuations,
revealing unexpected connections to the iron-pnictide superconductors. This
gives credence to a scenario in which nematic fluctuations drive an enhanced
$T_c$.

Doped Mott insulators are the starting point for interesting physics such as
high temperature superconductivity and quantum spin liquids. For multi-band
Mott insulators, orbital selective ground states have been envisioned. However,
orbital selective metals and Mott insulators have been difficult to realize
experimentally. Here we demonstrate by photoemission spectroscopy how
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, upon alkali-metal surface doping, develops a single-band metal
skin. Our dynamical mean field theory calculations reveal that homogeneous
electron doping of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ results in a multi-band metal. All together,
our results provide compelling evidence for an orbital-selective Mott insulator
breakdown, which is unachievable via simple electron doping. Supported by a
cluster model and cluster perturbation theory calculations, we demonstrate a
novel type of skin metal-insulator transition induced by surface dopants that
orbital-selectively hybridize with the bulk Mott state and in turn produce
coherent in-gap states.

<h3>Dynamic STEM-EELS for single atom and defect measurement during electron  beam transformations</h3>

On- and off-axis electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a powerful
method for probing local electronic structure on single atom level. However,
many materials undergo electron-beam induced transformation during the scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and spectroscopy, the problem
particularly acute for off-axis EELS signals. Here, we propose and
operationalize the rapid object detection and action system (RODAS) for dynamic
exploration of the structure-property relationships in STEM-EELS. In this
approach, the electron beam is used to induce dynamic transformations creating
new defect types at sufficiently small rates and avoiding complete material
destruction. The deep convolutional neural networks trained via the ensemble
learning iterative training (ELIT) approach are used to identify the defects as
they form and perform EELS measurements only at specific defect types. Overall,
in this case the EEL spectra are collected only at predefined objects of
interest, avoiding measurements on the ideal regions or holes. We note that
this approach can be extended to identify new defect classes as they appear,
allowing for efficient collection of structure-property relationship data via
balanced sampling over defect types.

Efforts were paid to disentangle the paramagnon signal from non-spin-flip
spectral weight mixing in the RIXS spectrum at $\bf{Q_{\|}}$ = $(0.6\pi, 0)$
and $(0.9\pi, 0)$ along the (1 0) direction. Our results show that, for doping
level x from 0.07 to 0.185, the variation of the paramagnon excitation energy
is marginal. We discuss the implication of our results in connection with the
evolution of the electron correlation strength in this system.

We propose a nanomechanical device which can actuate and probe a flying qubit
that can be used to facilitate quantum information transfer over a long
distance. The flying qubit is formed by a movable Cooper pair box (CPB)
consisting of a superconducting dot and a bulk superconductor which are
entangled by removing the Coulomb blockade of Cooper pair tunneling
electrostatically. We suggest that flying qubit states formed on movable CPB
can be observed in electron transport to a normal electrode via Andreev
reflections. The charge transfer due to periodic mechanical motion of CPB leads
to nonzero current at zero voltage and its coherence can be identified through
oscillatory dependence of the current on a gate voltage.

Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous
attentions over several decades, because it potentially allows one to control
spin transports in spintronics. But light is a transverse electromagnetic wave,
how an electron acquires a longitudinal velocity has been very puzzling. In
this paper, we show a general mechanism is working. It is the magnetic field
{\bf B} that steers the electron moving along the light propagation direction,
while its strong transverse motion leads to local excitation. We employ the
formalism put forth by Varga and Toroke to show that if we only include {\bf
E}, the electron only moves transversely with a large velocity. Including both
{\bf B} and {\bf E} and using real experimental laser parameters, we are able
to demonstrate that a laser pulse can drive the electron along the axial
direction by 20 to 262 $\rm \AA$, consistent with the experiments. The key
insight is that {\bf B} changes the direction of the electron and allows the
electron to move along the Poynting vector of light. Our finding has an
important consequence. Because a nonzero {\bf B} means a spatially dependent
vector potential ${\bf A} (\br,t)$, ${\bf B}=\nabla \times {\bf A}(\br,t)$,
this points out that the Coulomb gauge, that is, replacing ${\bf A}(\br,t)$ by
a spatial independent ${\bf A}(t)$, is unable to describe electron and spin
transport under laser excitation. Our finding is expected to have a potential
impact on the ongoing investigation of laser-driven spin transport.

Magnetically ordered materials reveal various types of magnetic moment
alignment that affects their functional properties. This makes the exploration
of unconventional magnetic orderings promising for the discovery of new
physical phenomena and spintronic applications. Here, we introduce cross-chain
antiferromagnets, dubbed X-type antiferromagnets, as an uncharted class of
magnetically ordered crystals, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices
form an orthogonal pattern of intersecting atomic chains. These largely
unexplored X-type antiferromagnets reveal unique spin-dependent transport
properties that are not present in conventional magnets. Using $\beta$-Fe2PO5
as a representative example of such X-type antiferromagnets, we predict the
emergence of sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport, where one magnetic
sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, spin torque can
be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast
dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the
antiferromagnetic domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of
magnetic moment alignment in antiferromagnets and reveals sublattice-selective
physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.

Magnetoelectric multiferroics are key materials for next-generation devices
due to their entangled magnetic and ferroelectric properties. Spiral
multiferroics induce ferroelectric polarization and are particularly promising
for electric control of magnetism and magnetic control of ferroelectricity. In
this work, we uncover long-period incommensurate states characterized by unique
multiferroic kinks in corundum nickelate Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$. Utilizing a
2-orbital $S=1$ model, we derive formulas for Heisenberg and anisotropic
magnetic exchanges and magnetically-induced polarization, enabling their
calculations from first principles. Our theory reproduces experimentally
observed magnetic structures and polarization dependence on the magnetic field
and predicts a three-step magnetic phase transition (flat spiral $\rightarrow$
conical spiral $\rightarrow$ spin-flop $\rightarrow$ ferromagnet) under
external magnetic fields. Kinks in the spiral phases repel each other through a
Yukawa-like potential arising from exchange of massive magnons. Furthermore,
our continuum theory predicts that an electric field directed one way
stabilizes the ferromagnetic state, while the opposite direction stabilizes the
spiral layer state. Our findings open a new pathway to predictive
first-principles modelling of multiferroics and may lead to technological
applications based on multiferroic kinks.

Enabling on-demand control of heat flow is key for the development of
next-generation electronic devices, solid-state heat pumps, and thermal logic.
However, precise and agile tuning of the relevant microscopic material
parameters for adjusting thermal conductivities remains elusive. Here, we study
several single crystals of lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO$_{3}$) with different
domain structures and show that ferroelastic domain walls behave as boundaries
that act like efficient controllers to govern thermal conductivity. At low
temperature (3 K), we demonstrate a fivefold reduction in thermal conductivity
induced by domain walls orthogonal to the heat flow and a twofold reduction
when they are parallel to the heat flow. Atomistic calculations fully support
this experimental observation. By breaking down phonon scattering mechanisms,
we also analyze the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity to
derive a quantitative relation between thermal conductivity variations and
domain wall organization and density.

Configuring TiO2 into bicontinuous mesostructures greatly improves its
photocatalytic efficiency. This is often ascribed to the expanded surface area.
Yet, whether mesostructuring modulates TiO2's electronic structure and how that
contributes to the improvement are rarely discussed. Here, we employed
spectroscopic and density functional theory approaches to address the question.
It is found that the improved efficacy could arise from an expansion in surface
area and elevation in density of states, both of which might collectively lead
to the observed reduction in charge-carrier recombination.

<h3>Polarizability Models for Simulations of Finite Temperature Raman  Spectra from Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics</h3>

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive method that is widely
used to study the vibrational properties of solids or molecules. Simulations of
finite-temperature Raman spectra rely on obtaining polarizabilities along
molecular dynamics trajectories, which is computationally highly demanding if
calculated from first principles. Machine learning force fields (MLFF) are
becoming widely used for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations, but
machine-learning models for polarizability are still rare. In this work, we
present and compare three polarizability models for obtaining Raman spectra in
conjunction with MLFF molecular dynamics trajectories: (i) model based on
projection to primitive cell eigenmodes, (ii) bond polarizability model, and
(iii) symmetry-adapted Gaussian process regression (SA-GPR) using smooth
overlap of atomic positions. In particular, we investigate the accuracy of
these models for different systems and how much training data is required.
Models are first applied to boron arsenide, where the first- and second-order
Raman spectra are studied as well as the effect of boron isotopes. With MoS$_2$
we study the applicability of the models for highly anisotropic systems and for
simulating resonant Raman spectra. Finally, inorganic halide perovskites
CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$ are studied with a particular interest in simulating
the spectra across phase transitions and the evolution of the central peak. All
models can be used to efficiently predict polarizabilities and are applicable
to large systems and long simulation times, and while all three models were
found to perform similarly for BAs and MoS$_2$, only SA-GPR offers sufficient
flexibility to accurately describe complex anharmonic materials like the
perovskites.

<h3>Ferroelectricity in crystals with non-polar point groups</h3>

Ferroelectric crystals must adopt one of the 10 polar point groups according
to the Neumann's principle. In this paper we propose that this conclusion is
based on perfect bulk crystals without taking the boundaries into account, and
we show first-principles evidence that ferroelectric polarizations may also be
formed in some non-polar point groups as the edges generally break the crystal
symmetry, which may even maintain at macroscale. They can be switchable in some
systems with weak van der Waals bondings or covalent-like ionic bondings where
long ion displacements with moderate barriers are possible. Such unconventional
ferroelectricity violates the Neumann's principle and Abrahams' conditions
respectively due to the boundaries and long ion displacements, which may
explain some unclarified phenomena reported previously as well as significantly
expand the scope of ferroelectrics.

<br>
<br>
GaN/AlxGa1-xN quantum wells were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on high
quality bulk (0001) GaN substrates. The quantum well thickness was set in the
6-8 nm range to favor the photoluminescence emission of indirect excitons.
Indeed, such excitons are known to be spatially indirect, due to the presence
of the internal electric field which spatially separates the electron and hole
wave functions. The growth conditions were optimized in view of minimizing the
photoluminescence peak broadening. In particular, the impact of growth
temperature (up to 900{\deg}C) on the surface morphology, structural and
photoluminescence properties was studied. The diffusion of indirect excitons on
the scale of tens of microns was measured with a micro-photoluminescence setup
equipped with a spatially resolved detection. A dedicated model and its
analysis allow us to extract from these measurements the exciton diffusion
constant and to conclude on the optimum growth conditions for the GaN/AlxGa1-xN
quantum well structures suited for studies of quantum collective effects in
indirect exciton liquids.

<h3>The interplay between electron tunneling and Auger emission in a single  quantum emitter weakly coupled to an electron reservoir</h3>

<br>
<br>
In quantum dots (QDs) the Auger recombination is a non-radiative scattering
process in which the optical transition energy of a charged exciton (trion) is
transferred to an additional electron leaving the dot. Electron tunneling from
a reservoir is the competing process that replenishes the QD with an electron
again. Here, we study the dependence of the tunneling and Auger recombintaion
rate on the applied electric field using high-resolution time-resolved
resonance fluorescence (RF) measurements. With the given p-i-n diode structure
and a tunnel barrier between the electron reservoir and the QD of $45\,$nm, we
measured a tunneling rate into the QD in the order of ms$^{-1}$. This rate
shows a strong decrease by almost an order of magnitude for decreasing electric
field, while the Auger emission rate decreases by a factor of five in the same
voltage range. Furthermore, we study in detail the influence of the Auger
recombination and the tunneling rate from the charge reservoir into the QD on
the intensity and linewidth of the trion transition. Besides the well-known
quenching of the trion transition, we observe in our time-resolved RF
measurements a strong influence of the tunneling rate on the observed
linewidth. The steady-state RF measurement yields a broadened trion transition
of about $1.5\,$GHz for an Auger emission rate of the same order as the
electron tunneling rate. In a non-equilibrium measurement, the Auger
recombination can be suppressed, and a more than four times smaller linewidth
of $340\,$MHz ($1.4\,$${\mu}$eV) is measured.

<h3>Dynamical quantum phase transitions following a noisy quench</h3>

We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum
phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse
magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic
Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the
problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the
noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless
DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of
closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the
phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate
during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the
system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to
a noisy quench.

<br>
<i>Kwai-Kong Ng, Min-Fong Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, a modified method of anomaly detection using convolutional
autoencoders is employed to predict phase transitions in several statistical
mechanical models on a square lattice. We show that, when the autoencoder is
trained with input data of various phases, the mean-square-error loss function
can serve as a measure of disorder, and its standard deviation becomes an
excellent indicator of critical points. We find that various types of phase
transition points, including first-order, second-order, and topological ones,
can be faithfully detected by the peaks in the standard deviation of the loss
function. Besides, the values of transition points can be accurately determined
under the analysis of finite-size scaling. Our results demonstrate that the
present approach has general application in identification/classification of
phase transitions even without a priori knowledge of the systems in question.

<br>
Residual stress and plastic strain in additive manufacturing materials can
exhibit significant microscopic variation at the powder scale, profoundly
influencing the overall properties of printed components. This variation
depends on process parameters and stems from multiple factors, including
differences in powder bed morphology, non-uniform thermo-structural profiles,
and inter-layer fusion. In this research, we propose a powder-resolved
multilayer multi-physics simulation scheme tailored for porous materials
through the process of selective sintering. This approach seamlessly integrates
finite element method (FEM)-based non-isothermal phase-field simulation with
thermo-elasto-plastic simulation, incorporating temperature- and
phase-dependent material properties. The outcome of this investigation includes
a detailed depiction of the mesoscopic evolution of stress and plastic strain
within a transient thermal-microstructure, evaluated across a spectrum of beam
power and scan speed parameters. Simulation results further reveal the
underlying mechanisms. For instance, stress concentration primarily occurs at
the necking region of partially melted particles and the junctions between
different layers, resulting in the accumulation of plastic strain and residual
stress, ultimately leading to structural distortion in the materials. Based on
the simulation data, regression models were proposed to describe the dependency
of the residual stress and the plastic strain on densification or beam energy
input, along with the comparison to experimental results.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions, the topological states possessing chiral magnetic
structure with non-trivial topology, have been widely investigated as a
promising candidate for spintronic devices. They can also couple with
superconducting vortices to form skyrmion-vortex pairs, hosting Majorana zero
mode which is a potential candidate for topological quantum computering. A lot
of theoretical proposals have been put forward on constructing skyrmion-vortex
pairs in heterostructures of chiral magnet and superconductor. Nevertheless,
how to generate skyrmion-vortex pairs in a controllable way experimentally
remains a significant challenge. We have designed a heterostructure of chiral
magnet and superconductor [CoFeB/Ir/Ta]7/Nb in which zero field N\'eel-type
skyrmions can be stabilized and the superconducting vortices can couple with
the skyrmions when Nb is in the superconducting state. We have directly
observed the formation of skyrmion-superconducting vortex pairs which is
dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field. Our results provide
an effective method to manipulate the quantum states of skyrmions with the help
of superconducting vortices, which can be used to explore the possible
existence of Majorana zero mode for future quantum computation.

The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is the archetype of a two-dimensional Olympic
network, composed of thousands of DNA minicircles and found in the
mitochondrion of certain parasites. The evolution, replication and
self-assembly of this structure are fascinating open questions in biology that
can also inform us how to realise synthetic Olympic networks in vitro. To
obtain a deeper understanding of the structure and assembly of kDNA networks,
we sequenced the Crithidia fasciculata kDNA genome and performed
high-resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and analysis of kDNA networks
that had been partially digested by selected restriction enzymes. We discovered
that these topological perturbations lead to networks with significantly
different geometrical features and morphologies with respect to the unperturbed
kDNA, and that these changes are strongly dependent on the class of DNA circles
targeted by the restriction enzymes. Specifically, cleaving maxicircles leads
to a dramatic reduction in network size once adsorbed onto the surface, whilst
cleaving both maxicircles and a minor class of minicircles yields non-circular
and deformed structures. We argue that our results are a consequence of a
precise positioning of the maxicircles at the boundary of the network, and we
discuss our findings in the context of kDNA biogenesis, design of artificial
Olympic networks and detection of in vivo perturbations.

<h3>The role of stacking on the electronic structure of MoSe2 at small twist  angles</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider two high symmetry stackings AA and AB and examine the changes
induced in the electronic structure by considering small angles of rotation of
3.48degrees from both these stackings. In both cases we largely recover the low
energy electronic structure of the untwisted limit. We additionally find flat
bands emerging above the dispersing bands. Surprisingly, while the rotation
from the AA end leads to one flat band above the highest occupied band at
{\Gamma}, one finds two flat bands emerging for small rotations from the AB
end. Examining the real space localization of the flat bands allows us to
discuss the origin of the flat bands in terms of quantum well states and
qualitatively understand the dependence of the number of flat bands found on
the twist angle.

<h3>Equilibrium in solid-state electrochemical cells at sample-electrolyte  boundary</h3>

<br>
<i>Yakov I. Korepanov</i>
<br>
<br>
In solid-state electrochemical experiments, the boundary between the sample
and the electrolyte plays a crucial role, and the rest of the sample acting as
a buffer that maintains a fixed composition. Due to the presence of an
electrochemical circuit in the cell (ionic conductivity in the electrolyte and
electronic conductivity in the sample system), the chemical potential is
equalized at the electrolyte-sample boundary. This leads to an equilibrium
state and allows for the measurement of equilibrium values, regardless of the
assumptions made by the experimenters. This article demonstrates the principle
of equalizing the electrochemical potential at the electrolyte-sample
interface, which explains why achieving equilibrium in the presence of an
electrolyte can occur much faster compared to sample synthesis, which often
occurs at higher temperatures. This fact can be used to synthesize sample
systems or other substances at the required temperatures with a significant
reduction in synthesis time.

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets are normally thought of as materials with compensated
magnetic sublattices. This adds to their technological advantages but
complicates readout of the antiferromagnetic state. We demonstrate
theoretically the existence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) which
is determined by the magnetic symmetry classes of Cr$_2$O$_3$ surfaces with an
in-plane magnetic easy axis. The DMI explains a previously predicted
out-of-plane magnetization at the nominally compensated surfaces of chromia,
leading to a surface-localized canted ferrimagnetism. This is in agreement with
magnetotransport measurements and with density functional theory predictions
which further allow us to quantify the strength of DMI. The temperature
dependence of the transversal resistance for these planes shows distinct
behavior in comparison with that of the Cr$_2$O$_3$ $c$ plane, which we
attribute to the influence of DMI. Our work provides a framework to analyze
surface-driven phenomena in antiferromagnets, and motivates the use of
nominally compensated chromia surfaces for antiferomagnetic spintronics and
magnonics.

Ultrafast laser irradiation can induce spontaneous self-organization of
surfaces into dissipative structures with nanoscale reliefs. These surface
patterns emerge from symmetry-breaking dynamical processes that occur in
Rayleigh-B\'enard-like instabilities. In this study, we demonstrate that the
coexistence and competition between surface patterns of different symmetries in
two dimensions can be numerically unraveled using the stochastic generalized
Swift-Hohenberg model. We originally propose a deep convolutional network to
identify and learn the dominant modes that stabilize for a given bifurcation
and quadratic model coefficients. The model is scale-invariant and has been
calibrated on microscopy measurements using a physics-guided machine learning
strategy. Our approach enables the identification of experimental irradiation
conditions for a desired self-organization pattern. It can be applied generally
to predict structure formation in situations where the underlying physics can
be approximately described by a self-organization process and data is sparse
and non-time series. Our work paves the way for supervised local manipulation
of matter using timely-controlled optical fields in laser manufacturing.

Ferromagnetic substrate influences the electromagnetic response of a type-II
superconducting film to the applied magnetic field. We present a
two-dimensional integrodifferential model for the magnetization of a flat
superconductor/ferromagnet bilayer of an arbitrary shape using a thin shell
quasistatic model for the ferromagnetic substrate and an infinitely thin
approximation for the superconducting layer. An efficient numerical method is
developed and used to investigate the effect of a ferromagnetic substrate. In
particular, we simulate the thin bilayer magnetization in a parallel field and,
for a high field, the critical-state distributions of the superconducting
current density. These critical-state distributions are different from those
known for a normal external field.

<br>
<br>
We study a nonequilibrium ferromagnetic mean-field spin model exhibiting a
phase with spontaneous temporal oscillations of the magnetization, on top of
the usual paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. This behavior is obtained by
introducing dynamic field variables coupled to the spins through non-reciprocal
couplings. We determine a nonequilibrium generalization of the Landau free
energy in terms of the large deviation function of the magnetization and of an
appropriately defined smoothed stochastic time derivative of the magnetization.
While the transition between paramagnetic and oscillating phase is continuous,
the transition between ferromagnetic and oscillating phases is found to be
discontinuous, with a coexistence of both phases, one being stable and the
other one metastable. Depending on parameter values, the ferromagnetic points
may either be inside or outside the limit cycle, leading to different
transition scenarios. The stability of these steady states is determined from
the large deviation function. We also show that in the coexistence region, the
entropy production has a pronounced maximum as a function of system size.

GENL is a flexible program that can be used to simulate and/or fit x-ray
diffraction data from epitaxial thin films exhibiting Laue oscillations. It
utilizes differential evolution within a genetic algorithm for the fitting of
data and is based on the kinematic theory of diffraction. Effects of
polarization, absorption, the Lorentz factor, as well as instrumental
resolution and vibrations are taken into account. Useful parameters that can be
extracted after fitting include: atomic interplanar spacings, number of
coherently scattering atomic planes, strain profiles along the film thickness,
and crystal roughness. The program has been developed in MATLAB and employs a
graphical user interface. The deployment strategy is twofold whereby the
software can either be obtained in source code form and executed within the
MATLAB environment, or as a pre-compiled binary for those who prefer not to run
it within MATLAB. Finally, GENL can easily be extended to simulate multilayered
film systems, superlattices, and films with atomic steps. The program is

<br>
<br>
Thanks to its tunable infrared band-gap and to its anisotropic conduction
properties, black phosphorus represents a very unique 2D material, whose
potential in the engineering of new devices still needs to be fully explored.
We investigate here the nonlinear terahertz (THz) electrodynamics of black
phosphorus along the more conducting armchair direction. Similarly to the case
of other 2D systems like graphene and topological insulators, the THz saturable
absorption properties of black phosphorus can be understood within a
thermodynamic model by assuming a fast thermalization of the electron bath.
While black phosphorus does not display the presence of massless fermions at
ambient pressure and temperature, our analysis shows that its anomalous THz
nonlinear properties can be accounted for by a relativistic massive Dirac
dispersion, provided the Fermi temperature is low enough. An optimal tuning of
the Fermi level therefore represents a strategy to engineer strong THz
nonlinear response in other massive Dirac materials as in transition metal
dichalchogenides or high-temperature superconductors.

<h3>On non-local electrical transport in anisotropic metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Graham Baker, Davide Valentinis, Andrew P. Mackenzie</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss various aspects of non-local electrical transport in anisotropic
metals. For a metal with circular Fermi surface, the scattering rates entering
the local conductivity and viscosity tensors are well-defined, corresponding to
eigenfrequencies of the linearized collision operator. For anisotropic metals,
we provide generalized formulas for these scattering rates and use a
variational approximation to show how they relate to microscopic transition
probabilities. We develop a simple model of a collision operator for a metal of
arbitrary Fermi surface with finite number of quasi-conserved quantities, and
derive expressions for the wavevector-dependent conductivity $\sigma(q)$ and
the spatially-varying conductivity $\sigma(x)$ for a long, narrow channel. We
apply this to the case of different rates for momentum-conserving and
momentum-relaxing scattering, deriving closed-form expressions for $\sigma(q)$
and $\sigma(x)$ -- beyond generalizing from circular to arbitrary Fermi surface
geometry, this represents an improvement over existing methods which solve the
relevant differential equation numerically rather than in closed form. For the
specific case of a diamond Fermi surface, we show that, if transport signatures
were interpreted via a model for a circular Fermi surface, the diagnosis of the
underlying transport regime would differ based on experimental orientation and
based on whether $\sigma(q)$ or $\sigma(x)$ was considered. Finally, we discuss
the bulk conductivity. While the common lore is that ``momentum''-conserving
scattering does not affect bulk resistivity, we show that \textit{crystal
momentum}-conserving scattering -- such as normal electron-electron scattering
-- can affect the bulk resistivity for an anisotropic Fermi surface. We derive
a simple formula for this contribution.

We present a minimal computational model to mimic the crowd in marathon race.
We aim to examine the influence of frontliners on crowd dynamics by comparing
the simulated races with and without their presence. The primary outcome of our
study revealed that the local velocity and density of the participants exhibit
a wave pattern similar to what is observed in actual races. Another important
result we obtained is that the travelling wave in the crowd consistently
propagates with a constant speed, irrespective of the system size under
consideration. The dynamic of participants in the longitudinal direction mainly
contributes for the velocity fluctuation and the fluctuation in the transverse
direction is suppressed. In the absence of frontliners, the fluctuations in
density and velocity weakens without significantly influencing the other
statistical and dynamical characteristics of the crowd. It is also observed
that the density wave travels faster than the velocity wave. Through this
research, we aim to enhance our understanding of crowd motion, which can inform
the development of effective crowd management strategies and contribute to the
successful control of such events.

<br>
<br>
Coulomb drag experiments have been an essential tool to study strongly
interacting low-dimensional systems. Historically, this effect has been
explained in terms of momentum transfer between electrons in the active and the
passive layer. Here, we report Coulomb drag measurements between laterally
coupled GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires in the multiple 1D sub-band regime that break
Onsager's reciprocity upon both layer and current direction reversal, in
contrast to prior 1D Coulomb drag results. The drag signal shows nonlinear I-V
characteristics, which are well characterized by a third-order polynomial fit.
These findings are qualitatively consistent with a rectified drag signal
induced by charge fluctuations. However, the nonmonotonic temperature
dependence of this drag signal suggests that strong electron-electron
interactions, expected within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid framework, remain
important and standard interaction models are insufficient to capture the
qualitative nature of rectified 1D Coulomb drag.

Determination of optimal control protocols for Majorana zero modes during
their exchange is a crucial step towards the realisation of the topological
quantum computer. In this paper, we study the finite-time exchange process of
Majorana zero modes on a network formed by coupled $p$-wave superconducting
one-dimensional nanowires. We provide scalable computational tools for
optimising such an exchange process relying on deep learning techniques. To
accomplish the scalability, we derive and implement an analytic formula for the
gradient of the quantum infidelity which measures the error in the topological
quantum gate generation in the Majorana zero modes exchange. Our optimisation
strategy relies on learning the optimised transport protocol via a neural net
which is followed by direct gradient descent fine tuning. The optimised
exchange protocols in the super-adiabatic regime discover the fact that the
Majorana zero modes must necessarily stop before crossing a junction point in
the network. We explain that this is caused by fast changes in the energy gap
of the system whenever one of the Majorana zero modes approaches a junction
point. In particular, the energy gap exhibits oscillations followed by a sharp
jump. We explain this phenomenon analytically in the regime where the Majorana
zero modes are completely localised. Finally, we study how the disorder in the
quantum nanowire affects the exchange protocols. This shows that understanding
the disorder pattern would allow one to improve quantum gate fidelity by one to
two orders of magnitude.

We observe significant, 6.5 - 12%, differences between skyrmion and
antiskyrmion Hall angles in existing experimental data. To account for them,
the Thiele equation is generalized with the transverse velocity component in
the collective coordinate of magnetization vector. The corresponding
generalized Hall angle is formulated, and its consequences are compared to the
data. A plausible physical origin is provided for explaining the Hall angle
differences.

Dimensionality can strongly influence the magnetic structure of solid
systems. Here, we predict theoretically and confirm experimentally that the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of bulk gadolinium germanide metalloxene,
which has a quasi-layered defective GdGe$_2$ structure, is preserved in the
ultrathin film limit. \textit{Ab initio} calculations demonstrate that
ultrathin GdGe$_2$ films present in-plane intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling
and AFM inter-layer coupling in the ground state. Angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy finds the AFM-induced band splitting expected for the 2 and 3
GdGe$_2$ trilayer (TL) films, which disappear above the N\'eel temperature. The
comparative analysis of isostructural ultrathin DyGe$_2$ and GdSi$_2$ films
confirms the magnetic origin of the observed band splitting. These findings are
in contrast with the recent report of ferromagnetism in ultrathin metalloxene
films, which we ascribe to the presence of uncompensated magnetic moments.

Fundamental understanding of thermal transport in compounds with ultra-low
thermal conductivity remains challenging, primarily due to the limitations of
conventional lattice dynamics and heat transport models. In this study, we
investigate the thermal transport in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) copper halide
CsCu2I3 by employing a combination of first principles-based self-consistent
phonon calculations and a dual-channel thermal transport model. Our results
show that the 0-K unstable soft modes, primarily dominated by Cs and I atoms in
CsCu2I3, can be an-harmonically stabilized at ~ 75 K. Furthermore, we predict
an ultra-low thermal conductivity of 0.362 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) along the chain axis
and 0.201 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) along cross chain direction in CsCu2I3 at 300 K.
Importantly, we find that an unexpected anomalous trend of increasing
cross-chain thermal conductivity with increasing temperature for CsCu2I3,
following a temperature dependence of ~T 0.106, which is atypical for a single
crystal and classified as an abnormal glass-like behavior. The peculiar
temperature-dependent behavior of thermal conductivity is elucidated by the
dominant wave-like tunnelling of phonons in thermal transport of CsCu2I3 along
cross-chain direction. In contrast, particle-like phonon propagation primarily
contributes to the chain-axis thermal conductivity across the entire
temperature range of 300-700 K. The sharp difference in the dominant thermal
transport channels between the two crystallographic directions can be
attributed to the unique chain-like quasi-1D structure of CsCu2I3. Our study
not only illustrates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in CsCu2I3
but also paves the way for searching for and designing materials with ultra-low
thermal conductivity.

Crystallographic anisotropy of the spin-dependent conductivity tensor can be
exploited to generate transverse spin-polarized current in a ferromagnetic
film. This ferromagnetic spin Hall effect is analogous to the spin-splitting
effect in altermagnets and does not require spin-orbit coupling.
First-principles screening of 41 non-cubic ferromagnets revealed that many of
them, when grown as a single crystal with tilted crystallographic axes, can
exhibit large spin Hall angles comparable with the best available
spin-orbit-driven spin Hall sources. Macroscopic spin Hall effect is possible
for uniformly magnetized ferromagnetic films grown on some low-symmetry
substrates with epitaxial relations that prevent cancellation of contributions
from different orientation domains. Macroscopic response is also possible for
any substrate if magnetocrystalline anisotropy is strong enough to lock the
magnetization to the crystallographic axes in different orientation domains.
