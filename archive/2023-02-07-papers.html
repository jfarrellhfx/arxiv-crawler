<h3>A unified field theory of topological defects and non-linear local  excitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03035</a>

Topological defects and excitations of ground states determine the properties
of systems exhibiting collective order. We introduce a general framework that
comprehensively describes these excitations, including metastable
configurations and transient dynamics, and show that it delivers general
information for understanding and tailoring collective behaviors. We focus on
systems with $O(n)$ broken rotational symmetry described by order parameters
which are uniform in the ordered phase and vanish in the disordered phase. From
these smooth order parameters, we derive a non-singular defect density, a
conserved quantity that tracks both topological defects and non-linear
localized excitations. Its associated conserved density current is determined
by the evolution of the order parameter and describes defect dynamics. Within
this formalism, we explore fast events, such as defect nucleation/annihilation
and dynamical phase transitions where the interaction between excitations
becomes particularly important. In particular, we use this framework to
highlight the similar topological structures and precursory patterns for the
nucleation of topological defects in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates,
active nematics, and crystal lattices. For the last two examples, where
translational symmetry is essential, our formalism also sheds light on a
hierarchy of topological defects associated with coexisting broken symmetries
and their role in dynamical transitions.

<h3>Quantum transport properties of tantalum-oxide resistive switching  filaments</h3>

Filamentary resistive switching devices are not only considered as promising
building blocks for brain-inspired computing architectures, but they also
realize an unprecedented operation regime, where the active device volume
reaches truly atomic dimensions. Such atomic-sized resistive switching
filaments represent the quantum transport regime, where the transmission
eigenvalues of the conductance channels are considered as a specific device
fingerprint. Here, we gain insight into the quantum transmission properties of
close-to-atomic-sized resistive switching filaments formed across an insulating
Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer through superconducting subgap spectroscopy. This method
reveals the transmission density function of the open conduction channels
contributing to the device conductance. Our analysis confirms the formation of
truly atomic-sized filaments composed of 3-8 Ta atoms at their narrowest
cross-section. We find that this diameter remains unchanged upon resistive
switching. Instead, the switching is governed by the redistribution of oxygen
vacancies within the filamentary volume. The set/reset process results in the
reduction/formation of an extended barrier at the bottleneck of the filament
which enhances/reduces the transmission of the highly open conduction channels.

<h3>Machine-Learning Accelerated Annealing with Fitting-Search Style for  Multi-alloy Structure Predictions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03321</a>

Structural prediction for the discovery of novel materials is a long sought
after goal of computational physics and materials sciences. The success is
rather limited for methods such as the simulated annealing method (SA) that
require expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations and follow
unintelligent search paths. Here a machine-learning based crystal combinatorial
optimization program (CCOP) with a fitting-search style is proposed to
drastically improve the efficiency of structural search in SA. CCOP uses a
graph neural network energy prediction model to reduce the DFT cost and a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm to direct the search path. Tests on six
multi-alloys show the energy prediction model is capable of extracting the
bonding characteristics of the complex alloys to achieve interpretability. It
also achieves high accuracy with a tiny training set (an increment of 30
samples per iteration) by active learning in less than 5 iterations. Comparison
with a few conventional methods shows that CCOP finds the lowest-energy
structures with the smallest number of search steps. CCOP cuts the computing
cost of SA by two orders of magnitude, while providing better search results
than SA. CCOP is promising for serving as a broadly applicable tool for the
efficient crystal structure predictions.

<h3>Brueckner $G$-matrix approach to two-dimensional Fermi gases with the  finite-range attractive interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03446" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03446</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional spin-1/2 fermions with the finite-range interaction are
theoretically studied. Characterizing the attractive interaction in terms of
the scattering length and the effective range, we discuss the finite-range
effects on the ground-state properties in this system. The Brueckner $G$-matrix
approach is employed to analyze the finite-range effects on an attractive
Fermi-polaron energy and the equation of state throughout the BEC-BCS crossover
in two dimensions, which can be realized in the population-imbalanced and
-balanced cases between two components, respectively. The analytical formulae
for these ground states obtained in this study would be useful for
understanding many-body phenomena with finite-range interactions in
low-dimensional systems.

<h3>Effect of random environment on kinetic roughening: Kardar-Parisi-Zhang  model with a static noise coupled to the Navier-Stokes equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03448</a>
<br>
<i>N. V. Antonov, P. I. Kakin, M. A. Reiter</i>
<br>
<br>
Kinetic roughening of a randomly growing surface can be modelled by the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with a time-independent (``spatially quenched'' or
``columnar'') random noise. In this paper, we use the field-theoretic
renormalization group approach to investigate how randomly moving medium
affects the kinetic roughening. The medium is described by the stochastic
differential Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible viscous fluid with an
external stirring force. We find that the action functional for the full
stochastic problem should be extended to be renormalizable: a new nonlinearity
must be introduced. Moreover, in order to correctly couple the scalar and
velocity fields, a new dimensionless parameter must be introduced as a factor
in the covariant derivative of the scalar field. The resulting action
functional involves four coupling constants and a dimensionless ratio of
kinematic coefficients. The one-loop calculation (the leading order of the
expansion in $\varepsilon=4-d$ with $d$ being the space dimension) shows that
the renormalization group equations in the five-dimensional space of those
parameters reveal a curve of fixed points that involves an infrared attractive
segment for $\varepsilon>0$.

<h3>Sonic shrinking of Pickering-stabilised ultrasound contrast agent at a  low acoustic amplitude</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03031</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ultrasound contrast agents comprise gas microbubbles surrounded by
stabilising elastic or viscoelastic shells. Microbubbles containing liquid or
solid cores are referred to as antibubbles. The manufacturing process of
long-lived antibubbles involves the adsorption of colloidal particles at the
interfaces, a process called Pickering stabilisation. With and without cores
present inside, Pickering-stabilised microbubbles generate a harmonic response,
even at modest transmission amplitudes. Therefore, Pickering-stabilised
ultrasound contrast agents may be of interest in contrast-enhanced ultrasonic
imaging. In a previous study, we determined that the presence of a core inside
Pickering-stabilised microbubbles slightly hampered the oscillation amplitude
compared to identical microbubbles without a core. The purpose of the present
study is to determine whether the absence of a core negatively influences the
stability of Pickering-stabilised microbubbles under sonication.

<h3>Particle migration in porous media: from the mesoscopic perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03032</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng Zhang, Tong Zhang, Jing-Jing Su, Dai-Chao Sheng</i>
<br>
<br>
Convection-diffusion equation is used to describe particle migration process
in many fields, while it is proposed based on the empirical Fick's law. In this
paper, with the help of the percolation model, we theoretically investigate the
particle migration law in porous media from the mesoscopic perspective, and
base on the probabilistic migration characteristic of particles to strictly
reformulate the convection-diffusion equation. Meanwhile the quantitative
relations between the convection, diffusion coefficients and the mesoscopic
parameters of particle-motion and percolation-configuration are revealed.
Furthermore, via the Monte-Carlo numerical simulation, we verify the proposed
mesoscopic particle migration theory and modify the expressions of convection,
diffusion coefficients for global applicability. In addition, applicable
qualification of the proposed mesoscopic theory is given, and relation between
the blocking effect parameter and connecting probability of the percolation
model is obtained.

<h3>Growing structure based on viscous actuation of constrained multistable  elements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03034</a>
<br>
<i>Ezra Ben Abu, Yaron Veksler, Shai Elbaz, Anna Zigelman, Amir D. Gat</i>
<br>
<br>
Growing soft materials which follow a 3D path in space are critical to
applications such as search and rescue and minimally invasive surgery. Here, we
present a concept for a single-input growing multi-stable soft material, based
on a constrained straw-like structure. This class of materials are capable of
maneuvering and transforming their configuration by elongation while executing
multiple turns. This is achieved by sequenced actuation of bi-stable frusta
with predefined constraints. Internal viscous flow and variations in the
stability threshold of the individual cells enable sequencing and control of
the robot's movement so as to follow a desired 3D path as the structure grows.
We derive a theoretical description of the shape and dynamics resulting from a
particular set of constraints. To validate the model and demonstrate the
suggested concept, we present experiments of maneuvering in models of
residential and biological environments. In addition to performing complex 3D
maneuvers, the tubular structure of these robots may also be used as a conduit
to reach inaccessible regions, which is demonstrated experimentally.

<h3>Topological Non-Hermitian skin effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Rijia Lin, Tommy Tai, Linhu Li, Ching Hua Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
This article reviews recent developments in the non-Hermitian skin effect
(NHSE), particularly on its rich interplay with topology. The review starts off
with a pedagogical introduction on the modified bulk-boundary correspondence,
the synergy and hybridization of NHSE and band topology in higher dimensions,
as well as, the associated topology on the complex energy plane such as
spectral winding topology and spectral graph topology. Following which,
emerging topics are introduced such as non-Hermitian criticality, dynamical
NHSE phenomena, and the manifestation of NHSE beyond the traditional linear
non-interacting crystal lattices, particularly its interplay with quantum
many-body interactions. Finally, we survey the recent demonstrations and
experimental proposals of NHSE.

<h3>Granular binary mixtures improve energy dissipation efficiency of  granular dampers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03069</a>
<br>
<i>Nydia Roxana Varela-Rosales, Angel Santarossa, Michael Engel, Thorsten Pöschel</i>
<br>
<br>
Granular dampers are systems used to attenuate undesired vibrations produced
by mechanical devices. They consist of cavities filled by granular particles.
In this work, we consider a granular damper filled with a binary mixture of
frictionless spherical particles of the same material but different size using
numerical discrete element method simulations. We show that the damping
efficiency is largely influenced by the composition of the binary mixture.

<h3>Characteristics of fluid-fluid displacement in model mixed-wet porous  media: patterns, pressures, and scalings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03072</a>
<br>
<i>Ashkan Irannezhad, Bauyrzhan K. Primkulov, Ruben Juanes, Benzhong Zhao</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the characteristics of fluid-fluid displacement in simple mixed-wet
porous micromodels numerically using a dynamic pore network model. The porous
micromodel consists of distinct water-wet and oil-wet regions, whose fractions
are systematically varied to yield a variety of displacement patterns over a
wide range of capillary numbers. We find that the impact of mixed-wettability
is most prominent at low capillary number, and it depends on the complex
interplay between wettability fraction and the intrinsic contact angle of the
water-wet regions. For example, the fractal dimension of the displacement
pattern is a monotonically increasing function of wettability fraction in flow
cells with strongly water-wet clusters, but it becomes non-monotonic with
respect to wettability fraction in flow cells with weakly water-wet clusters.
Additionally, mixed-wettability also manifests itself in the injection-pressure
signature, which exhibits fluctuations especially at low wettability fraction.
Specifically, preferential filling of water-wet regions leads to reduced
effective permeability and higher injection pressure, even at vanishingly small
capillary numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling analyses based on a
weighted average description of the overall wetting state of the mixed-wet
system can effectively capture the variations in observed displacement pattern
morphology.

<h3>Real-space and reciprocal-space topology in the Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$  square net system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03076</a>
<br>
<i>Jaime M. Moya, Jianwei Huang, Shiming Lei, Kevin Allen, Yuxiang Gao, Yan Sun, Ming Yi, E. Morosan</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetotransport measurements on the centrosymetric square-net
Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ compounds reveal evidence for both reciprocal- and
real-space topology. For compositions $0.50 \leq x \leq 0.90$, several
intermediate field phases are found by magnetization measurements when $H
\parallel c$, where a maximum in the topological Hall effect (THE) is observed,
pointing to the existence of topological (real-space topology) or non-coplanar
spin textures. For $0.25 \leq x \leq 0.39$, magnetization measurements reveal
an intermediate field state, but no transition is visible in the Hall
measurements. For $x = 0.15$, only one magnetic transition occurs below the
N\'eel temperature $T_N$, and no intermediate field spin reorientations are
observed. The Hall effect varies smoothly before the spin-polarized (SP) state.
However, in the SP state, Hall measurements reveal a large anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) for all compositions, a consequence of reciprocal-space topology.
Density functional theory calculations in the paramagnetic state indeed reveal
a Dirac point that lies very near the Fermi energy, which is expected to split
into Weyl nodes in the SP state, thereby explaining the observed AHE. These
results suggest the Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ family is a rare material platform
where real- and reciprocal-space topology exist in a single material platform.

<h3>A probabilistic model of resistance jumps in memristive devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03079" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03079</a>
<br>

<br>
Resistance switching memory cells such as electrochemical metallization cells
and valence change mechanism cells have the potential to revolutionize
information processing and storage. However, the creation of deterministic
resistance switching devices is a challenging problem that is still open. At
present, the modeling of resistance switching cells is dominantly based on
deterministic models that fail to capture the cycle-to-cycle variability
intrinsic to these devices. Herewith we introduce a state probability
distribution function and associated integro-differential equation to describe
the switching process consisting of a set of stochastic jumps. Numerical and
analytical solutions of the equation have been found in two model cases. This
work expands the toolbox of models available for resistance switching cells and
related devices, and enables a rigorous description of intrinsic physical
behavior not available in other models.

<h3>Ab initio study of the nonlinear optical properties and d.c.  photocurrent of the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03090</a>
<br>
<i>Álvaro R. Puente-Uriona, Stepan S. Tsirkin, Ivo Souza, Julen Ibañez-Azpiroz</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a first principles theoretical study employing nonlinear response
theory to investigate the d.c. photocurrent generated by linearly polarized
light in the type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe$_4$. We report the low energy
spectrum of several nonlinear optical effects. At second-order, we consider the
shift an injection currents. Assuming the presence of a static built-in
electric field, at third-order we study the current-induced shift and injection
currents, as well as the jerk current. We discuss our result in the context of
a recent experiment measuring exceptionally large photoconductivity (J. Ma et
al., Nat. Mater. 18, 476-481 (2019).). According to our results, the jerk
current is the most likely origin of the large response. Finally, we propose
means to discern the importance of the various mechanisms involved in a
time-resolved experiment.

<h3>Observation of Coherently Coupled Cation Spin Dynamics in an Insulating  Ferrimagnetic Oxide</h3>

Many technologically useful magnetic oxides are ferrimagnetic insulators,
which consist of chemically distinct cations. Here, we examine the spin
dynamics of different magnetic cations in ferrimagnetic NiZnAl-ferrite
(Ni$_{0.65}$Zn$_{0.35}$Al$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.2}$O$_4$) under continuous microwave
excitation. Specifically, we employ time-resolved x-ray ferromagnetic resonance
to separately probe Fe$^{2+/3+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ cations on different sublattice
sites. Our results show that the precessing cation moments retain a rigid,
collinear configuration to within $\approx$2$^\circ$. Moreover, the effective
spin relaxation is identical to within $<$10% for all magnetic cations in the
ferrite. We thus validate the oft-assumed ``ferromagnetic-like'' dynamics in
resonantly driven ferrimagnetic oxides, where the magnetic moments from
different cations precess as a coherent, collective magnetization.

<h3>Twist-angle dependent proximity induced spin-orbit coupling in  graphene/topological insulator heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03102</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in heterostructures of
twisted graphene and topological insulators (TIs) Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$
is investigated from first principles. To build commensurate supercells, we
strain graphene and correct thus resulting band offsets by applying a
transverse electric field. We then fit the low-energy electronic spectrum to an
effective Hamiltonian that comprises orbital and spin-orbit terms. For twist
angles 0$^\circ\leq\Theta \lessapprox 20^\circ$, we find the dominant
spin-orbit couplings to be of the valley-Zeeman and Rashba types, both a few
meV strong. We also observe a sign change in the induced valley-Zeeman SOC at
$\Theta\approx 10^\circ$. Additionally, the in-plane spin structure resulting
from the Rashba SOC acquires a non-zero radial component, except at $0^\circ$
or $30^\circ$. At $30^\circ$ the graphene Dirac cone interacts directly with
the TI surface state. We therefore explore this twist angle in more detail,
studying the effects of gating, TI thicknesses, and lateral shifts on the SOC
parameters. We find, in agreement with previous results, the emergence of the
proximitized Kane-Mele SOC, with a change in sign possible by electrically
tuning the Dirac cone within the TI bulk band gap.

<h3>Combining Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction, Mechanistic Modeling, and  Machine Learning for In Situ Subsurface Temperature Quantification during  Additive Manufacturing</h3>

<br>
Laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (AM) produces extreme
gradients of temperature in both space and time, which in turn influence
microstructural development in the material. Qualification and model validation
of the process itself and resulting material produced necessitates the ability
to characterize these temperature fields. However, well-established means to
directly probe material temperature below the surface of an alloy while it is
being processed are limited. To address this gap in characterization
capabilities, we present a novel means to extract subsurface temperature
distribution metrics, with uncertainty, from in situ synchrotron X-ray
diffraction measurements to provide quantitative temperature evolution during
laser melting. Temperature distribution metrics are determined using Gaussian
Process Regression supervised machine learning surrogate models trained with a
combination of mechanistic modeling (heat transfer and fluid flow) and X-ray
diffraction simulation. Trained surrogate model uncertainties are found to
range from 5\% to 15\% depending on the metric and current temperature. The
surrogate models are applied to extracting temperature metrics from an Inconel
625 nickel superalloy wall specimen during AM. Maximum temperatures of the
solid phase in the diffraction volume during processing are found to reach the
solidus temperature as expected, with mean and minimum temperatures found to be
several hundred degrees less. The highest accuracy of extracted temperature
metrics is found to be near melting, while temperatures during cooling are
likely influenced by the development of residual stress.

<h3>Improved quasiparticle self-consistent electronic band structure and  excitons in $β$-LiGaO$_2$</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The band structure of $\beta$-LiGaO$_2$ is calculated using the quasiparticle
self-consistent QS$G\hat W$ method where the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat
W$ is evaluated including electron-hole interaction ladder diagrams and $G$ is
the one-electron Green's function. Improved convergence compared to previous
calculations leads to a significantly larger band gap of about 7.0 eV. However,
exciton binding energies are found to be large and lead to an exciton gap of
about 6.0 eV if also a zero-point-motion correction of about $-0.4$ eV is
included. These results are in excellent agreement with recent experimental
results on the onset of absorption. Besides the excitons observed thus far, the
calculations indicate the existence of a Rydberg-like series of exciton excited
states, which is however modified from the classical Wannier exciton model by
the anisotropies of the material and the more complex mixing of Bloch states in
the excitons resulting from the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The exciton fine
structure and the exciton wave functions are visualized and analyzed in various
ways.

<h3>Hamiltonian extrema of an arbitrary flux-biased Josephson circuit</h3>

<br>
<br>
Flux-biased loops including one or more Josephson junctions are ubiquitous
elements in quantum information experiments based on superconducting circuits.
These quantum circuits can be tuned to implement a variety of Hamiltonians,
with applications ranging from decoherence-protected qubits to quantum limited
converters and amplifiers. The extrema of the Hamiltonian of these circuits are
of special interest because they govern their low-energy dynamics. However, the
theory of superconducting quantum circuits lacks so far a systematic method to
compute the series expansion of the Hamiltonian around these extrema for an
arbitrary non-linear superconducting circuit. We present such method, which can
aid the synthesis of new functionalities in quantum devices.

In this work, we present a theory for topological phases for quantum systems
on tree graphs. Conventionally, topological phases of matter have been studied
in regular lattices, but also in quasicrystals and amorphous settings. We
consider specific generalizations of regular tree graphs, and explore their
topological properties. Unlike conventional systems, infinite quantum trees are
not finite-dimensional, allowing for novel phenomena. We find a proliferation
of topological zero modes present throughout the entire system, indicating that
the bulk also acts as a boundary. We then go on to show that only three
symmetry classes host stable topological phases in contrast to the usual five
symmetry classes per dimension. Finally, we introduce what we call the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger tree which is topologically non-trivial even in the
absence of inner degrees of freedom and does not possess any gapped trivial
phases. We realize this system in an electronic circuit and show that our
theory matches with experiments.

Recently, the pressure has been used as external stimuli to induce structural
and magnetic phase transitions in many layered quantum materials whose layers
are linked by van der Waals forces. Such materials with weakly held layers
allow relatively easy manipulation of the superexchange mechanism and lead to
novel magnetic behavior. Using the hydrostatic pressure as a disorderless means
to manipulate the interlayer coupling, we applied pressure on two quasi-2D
sister compounds, namely, Cr2Si2Te6 (CST) and Mn3Si2Te6 (MST), up to ~1 GPa.
Magnetic property measurements with the application of pressure revealed that
the ferromagnetic transition temperature decreases in CST while the opposite
trend occurs for the ferrimagnet MST. In MST, the magnetization decreases with
the increase in the pressure, and such trend is not clearly noticed in CST,
within the pressure range studied. Theoretical calculations showed the overall
pressure effect on layer separation, bond angle, and exchange coupling,
strongly influencing the change in subsequent magnetic characteristics.
Exchange coupling in Mn3Si2Te6 is strongly frustrated and the first nearest
neighbor interaction is the most dominant of the components with the strongest
pressure dependence. Whereas, in Cr2Si2Te6, the exchange coupling parameters
exhibit very little dependence on the pressure. This combined experimental and
theoretical work has the potential to expand to other relevant quantum
materials.

<h3>Information geometry and Bose-Einstein condensation</h3>

It is a long held conjecture in the connection between information geometry
(IG) and thermodynamics that the curvature endowed by IG diverges at phase
transitions. Recent work on the IG of Bose-Einstein (BE) gases challenged this
conjecture by saying that in the limit of fugacity approaching unit -- where BE
condensation is expected -- curvature does not diverge, rather it converges to
zero. However, as the discontinuous behavior that identify condensation is only
observed at the thermodynamic limit, a study of IG curvature at finite number
of particles, $N$, is in order from which the thermodynamic behaviour can be
observed by taking the thermodynamic limit ($N\to \infty$) posteriorly. This
article presents such study, which was made possible by the recent advances
presented in [Phys. Rev. A 104, 043318 (2021)]. We find that for a trapped gas,
as $N$ increases, the values of curvature decrease proportionally to a power of
$N$ while the temperature at which the maximum value of curvature occurs
approaches the usually defined critical temperature. This means that, in the
thermodynamic limit, curvature has a limited value where a phase transition is
observed, contradicting the forementioned conjecture.

<br>
<br>
We present an inelastic neutron scattering study of liquid and solid hydrogen
carried out using the wide Angular Range Chopper Spectrometer at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. From the observed dynamic structure factor, we obtained
empirical estimates of the molecular mean-squared displacement and average
translational kinetic energy. We find that the former quantity increases with
temperature, indicating that a combination of thermal and quantum effects is
important near the liquid-solid phase transition, contrary to previous
measurements. We also find that the kinetic energy drops dramatically upon
melting of the crystals, a consequence of the large increase in molar volume
together with the Heisenberg indeterminacy principle. Our results are compared
with quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on different model potentials. In
general, there is good agreement between our findings and theoretical
predictions based on the Silvera-Goldman and Buck potentials.

In this paper, we present a unifying analytical framework for identifying
conditions for transport effects such as reflectionless and transparent
transport, lasing, and coherent perfect absorption in non-Hermitian
nonreciprocal systems using a generalized transfer matrix method. This provides
a universal approach to studying the transport of tight-binding platforms,
including higher-dimensional models and those with an internal degree of
freedom going beyond the previously studied case of one-dimensional chains with
nearest-neighbor couplings. For a specific class of tight-binding models, the
relevant transport conditions and their signatures of non-Hermitian,
nonreciprocal, and topological behavior are analytically tractable from a
general perspective. We investigate this class and illustrate our formalism in
a paradigmatic ladder model where the system's parameters can be tuned to
adjust the transport effect and topological phases.

<h3>Colossal anomalous Hall and Nernst effect from the breaking of  nodal-line symmetry in Cu2CoSn Weyl semimetal: A first-principles study</h3>

<br>
<br>
The presence of topological band crossings near the Fermi energy is essential
for the realization of large anomalous transport properties in the materials.
The topological semimetals (TSMs) host such properties owing to their unique
topological band structure such as Weyl points or nodal lines (NLs), that is
protected by certain symmetries of the crystal. When the NLs break out in the
system due to perturbation in Hamiltonian, a large Berry curvature arises in
the surrounding area of the gapped NL. In the present work, we studied
anomalous transport properties of Cu2CoSn compound, which has a cubic Heusler
crystal structure (space group: Fm-3m). The Cu2CoSn full Heusler compound
possesses three NLs in the absence of spin-orbit coupling close to the Fermi
level. These NLs gap out with the consideration of the SOC and a large Berry
curvature observed along the gapped NLs. The integral of Berry curvature gives
the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) about 1003 S/cm and the
anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) of about 3.98 A/m-K at the Fermi level.
These values of AHC and ANC are comparable to the largest reported values for
the Co2MnGa Heusler compound. Therefore, Cu2CoSn becomes a newborn member of
the family of full Heusler compounds, which possesses giant AHC and ANC that
can be useful for the spintronics application.

<br>
<br>
The compound V$_5$S$_8$ can also be represented by V$_{1.25}$S$_2$, a
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) with excess V. Very few TMDCs show
magnetism and/or Kondo effect. Among them, the sister compounds VSe$_2$ and
VTe$_2$ are recently proved to show ferromagnetism in addition to the
low-temperature resistivity upturn due to Kondo effect. In this study, we show
Kondo effect in V$_5$S$_8$ originated from the antiferromagnetic exchange
interactions among the intercalated V atoms below the N$\acute{e}$el ($T_N$)
temperature of 27 K. We find isotropic magnetic properties above $T_N$, while a
strong magnetic anisotropy is noticed below $T_N$. In addition, below $T_N$ we
find an out-of-plane ($H\parallel c$) spin-flop transition triggered at a
critical field of 3.5 T that is absent from the in-plane ($H\perp c$).
Angle-dependent magnetoresistance is found to be highly anisotropic in the
antiferromagnetic state.

<h3>Dielectric response of confined water films: Insights from classical DFT</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Borgis, Damien Laage, Luc Belloni, Guillaume Jeanmairet</i>
<br>
<br>
We re-examine the problem of the dielectric response of highly polar liquids
such as water in confinement between two walls using a simple two-variable
density functional theory involving number and polarisation densities. In the
longitudinal polarisation case where a perturbing field is applied
perpendicularly to the walls, we show that the notion of local dielectric
constant, although ill-defined at a microscopic level, makes sense when a
coarse-graining over the typical size of a particle is introduced. The approach
makes it possible to study the effective dielectric response of thin liquid
films of various thicknesses in connection to the recent experiments of
[Fumagalli et al. , Science, 2018, 360, 1339-1342], and to discuss the notion
interfacial dielectric constant. We argue that the observed properties as
function of slab dimension, in particular the very low dielectric constants of
the order of 2-3 measured for thin slabs of 1 nm thickness do not highlight any
special property of water but can be recovered for a generic polar solvent
having similar particle size and the same high dielectric constant. Regarding
the transverse polarisation case where the perturbing field is parallel to the
walls, the associated effective dielectric constant as a function of the slab
dimension reaches bulk-like values at much shorter widths than in the
longitudinal case.

<h3>Fluctuations and stability of a fast driven Otto cycle</h3>

<br>
<i>Ana Laura Gramajo, Elisabetta Paladino, Jukka Pekola, Rosario Fazio</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the stochastic dynamics of a thermal machine realized by a
fast-driven Otto cycle. By employing a stochastic approach, we find that system
coherences strongly affect fluctuations depending on the thermodynamic current.
Specifically, we observe an increment in the system instabilities when
considering the heat exchanged with the cold bath. On the contrary, the cycle
precision improves when the system couples with the hot bath, where
thermodynamic fluctuations reduce below the classical Thermodynamic Uncertainty
Relation bound. Violation of the classical bound holds even when a dephasing
source couples with the system. We also find that coherence suppression not
only restores the cycle cooling but also enhances the convergence of
fluctuation relations by increasing the entropy production of the reversed
process. An additional analysis unveiled that the stochastic sampling required
to ensure good statistics increases for the cooling cycle while downsizes for
the other protocols. Despite the simplicity of our model, our results provide
further insight into thermodynamic relations at the stochastic level.

<h3>Slow diffusion and Thouless localization criterion in modulated spin  chains</h3>

<br>
<br>
In recent years the ergodicity of disordered spin chains has been
investigated via extensive numerical studies of the level statistics or the
transport properties. However, a clear relationship between these results has
yet to be established. We present a relation between the diffusion constant and
the energy-level structure, which leads to the Thouless localization criterion.
The latter explains the drift of the crossover/transition to the localized
regime with increasing system size. Moreover, we show that the Heisenberg spin
chain in the presence of the quasiperiodic fields can be well approached via a
sequence of simple periodic systems, where diffusion remains finite even at
large fields.

<h3>Lack of symmetry restoration after a quantum quench: an entanglement  asymmetry study</h3>

<br>
<i>Filiberto Ares, Sara Murciano, Eric Vernier, Pasquale Calabrese</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the quantum quench in the XX spin chain starting from a tilted
N\'eel state which explicitly breaks the $U(1)$ symmetry of the post-quench
Hamiltonian. Very surprisingly, the $U(1)$ symmetry is not restored at large
time because of the activation of a non-abelian set of charges which all break
it. The breaking of the symmetry can be effectively and quantitatively
characterised by the recently introduced entanglement asymmetry. By a
combination of exact calculations and quasi-particle picture arguments, we are
able to exactly describe the behaviour of the asymmetry at any time after the
quench. Furthermore we show that the stationary behaviour is completely
captured by a non-abelian generalised Gibbs ensemble. While our computations
have been performed for a non-interacting spin chain, we expect similar results
to hold for the interacting case as well because of the presence of non-abelian
charges also in that case.

<h3>Graph deep learning accelerated efficient crystal structure search and  feature extraction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Structural search and feature extraction are a central subject in modern
materials design, the efficiency of which is currently limited, but can be
potentially boosted by machine learning (ML). Here, we develop an ML-based
prediction-analysis framework, which includes a symmetry-based combinatorial
crystal optimization program (SCCOP) and a feature additive attribution model,
to significantly reduce computational costs and to extract property-related
structural features. Our method is highly accurate and predictive, and extracts
structural features from desired structures to guide materials design. As a
case study, we apply our new approach to a two-dimensional B-C-N system, which
identifies 28 previously undiscovered stable structures out of 82 compositions;
our analysis further establishes the structural features that contribute most
to energy and bandgap. Compared to conventional approaches, SCCOP is about 10
times faster while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Our new framework is
generally applicable to all types of systems for precise and efficient
structural search, providing new insights into the relationship between
ML-extracted structural features and physical properties.

A significant step forward in Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) developments can
only be achieved by proposing mold-breaking research based on selecting the
best materials for the cell components, optimizing cell manufacture,
anticipating the degradation mechanisms of the LIBs, and consolidating the
regeneration processes of damaged batteries. LIBs with longer recycling life,
better safety, and the ability to be reused will establish sustainable
state-of-the-art batteries with maximum energy efficiency, low costs, and
minimal CO2 emissions within a circular economy, promoting sustainability in
areas as relevant as electromobility and portable electronics. Recently, there
has been increasing interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)
techniques and their subclasses to better predict novel materials with designed
properties. This collection of methods has already obtained considerable
success, having been used to predict numerous physical properties of materials.
However, compared to other fields, the materials data are typically much
smaller and sometimes more diverse, which undoubtedly affects the construction
and effectiveness of AI models. At present, several Data Augmentation (DA)
methods have been proposed in materials science based on flipping, rotating,
and distorting the unit cells of materials, which have been demonstrated to be
very efficient in increasing the size and quality of data. Here we present an
even more effective new method of Data Augmentation based on the lattice
scaling of crystal structures. In the lattice scaling DA method, the unit cell
is perturbed, undergoing an increase and decrease of the unit cell volume in an
isotropic or anisotropic way. This transformation is particularly pertinent for
battery components since volume changes of up to 5% have been reported for the
insertion-based LIBs during cycling.

Temperature variation of the lower critical field in the noncentrosymmetric
superconductor $\alpha$-BiPd was probed by local magnetization measurements
using Hall micromagnetometry, performed down to 0.3 K in a magnetic field
applied along the crystallographic $b$ axis. Below a critical temperature $T_c
\simeq$ 3.8 K, a conventional $H_{c1}(T)$ dependence was found, typical for a
single-band $s$-wave BCS superconductor. The obtained data imply an absence of
spin-triplet component in the superconducting wavefunction and marginal
multiband effects in this material, which contradicts some literature reports.

Recently, superconductivity was discovered in the infinite layer of
hole-doped nickelates NdNiO$_{2}$. Contrary to this, superconductivity in
LaNiO$_{2}$ is still under debate. This indicates the crucial role played by
the $f$ electrons on the electronic structure and the pairing mechanism of
infinite-layer nickelates. Here we discuss the role of the electron
correlations on the $f$ electron states and their influence on the electronic
structure. We show that the lattice parameters are in good agreement with the
experimental values, independent of the chosen parameters within the DFT+$U$
approach. Increasing Coulomb interaction $U$ tends to shift the $f$ states away
from the Fermi level. Surprisingly, independently of the position of $f$ states
with respect to the Fermi energy, these states play an important role in the
electronic band structure, which can be reflected in the modification of the
NdNiO$_{2}$ effective models.

The liquid-vapor phase separation is investigated via lattice Boltzmann
simulations in three dimensions. After expressing length and time scales in
reduced physical units, we combined data from several large simulations (on
$512^3$ nodes), with different values of viscosity, surface tension and
temperature, to obtain a single curve of rescaled length $\hat{l}$ as a
function of rescaled time $\hat{t}$. We find evidence of the existence of
diffusive and inertial regimes with growth exponents $\alpha_d=1/2$ and
$\alpha_i=2/3$ over several time decades, with a crossover from $\alpha_d$ to
$\alpha_i$ at $\hat{t} \simeq 1$. An in-depth analysis of the kinetics of the
phase separation process, as well as a characterization of the morphology and
the flow properties, are further presented in order to provide clues into the
dynamics of the phase-separation process.

Impurity-vacancy centers in diamond offer a new class of robust photon
sources with versatile quantum properties. While individual color centers
commonly act as single-photon sources, their ensembles have been theoretically
predicted to have tunable photon-emission statistics. Importantly, the
particular type of excitation affects the emission properties of a color center
ensemble within a diamond crystal. While optical excitation favors
non-synchronized excitation of color centers within an ensemble, electron-beam
excitation can synchronize the emitters and thereby provides a control of the
second-order correlation function $g_2(0)$. In this letter, we demonstrate
experimentally that the photon stream from an ensemble of color centers can
exhibit $g_2(0)$ both above and below unity. Such a photon source based on an
ensemble of few color centers in a diamond crystal provides a highly tunable
platform for informational technologies operating at room temperature.

The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a
photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These
processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time
constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured
open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. The present paper provides
a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias
light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The
approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential
equations that is solved analytically be determining the eigenvalues of a 2 x 2
matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay
times during a transient photovoltage measurement, we determine the rates of
carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage and
establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the
perovskite solar cell.

Observing finite regions of a bigger system is a common experience, from
microscopy to molecular simulations. In the latter especially, there is ongoing
interest in predicting thermodynamic properties from tracking fluctuations in
finite observation volumes. However, kinetic properties have received less
attention, especially not in ionic solutions, where electrostatic interactions
play a decisive role. Here, we probe ionic fluctuations in finite volumes with
Brownian dynamics and build an analytical framework that reproduces our
simulation results and is broadly applicable to other systems with pairwise
interactions. Particle number and charge correlations exhibit a rich
phenomenology with time, characterized by a diversity of timescales. The noise
spectrum of both quantities decays as $1/f^{3/2}$, where $f$ is the frequency.
This signature of fractional noise shows the universality of $1/f^{3/2}$
scalings when observing diffusing particles in finite domains. The hyperuniform
behaviour of charge fluctuations, namely that correlations scale with the area
of the observation volume, is preserved in time. Correlations even become
proportional to the box perimeter at sufficiently long times. Our results pave
the way to understand fluctuations in more complex systems, from nanopores to
single-particle electrochemistry.

<h3>Crack tip kinematics reveal the cohesive zone structure in brittle  hydrogel fracture</h3>

<br>
<br>
When brittle hydrogels fail, several mechanisms conspire to alter the state
of stress near the tip of a crack, and it is challenging to identify which
mechanism is dominant. In the fracture of brittle solids, a sufficient
far-field stress results in the complete loss of structural strength as the
material `unzips' at the tip of a crack, where stresses are concentrated.
Direct studies of the so-called small-scale yielding zone, where deformation is
large, are sparing. Using hydrogels as a model brittle solid, we probe the
small-scale yielding region with a combination of microscopy methods that
resolve the kinematics of the deformation. A zone over which most of the energy
is dissipated through the loss of cohesion is identified in the immediate
surroundings of the crack tip. With direct measurements, we determine the scale
and structure of this zone, and identify how the specific loss mechanisms in
this hydrogel material might generalize for brittle material failure.

the Knight shift ($K$) and susceptibility ($K$-$\chi$ plot) and obtained the

<br>

Sliding ferroelectricity is a recently observed polarity existing in
two-dimensional materials. However, due to their weak polarization and poor
electrical insulation in these materials, all available experimental evidence
till now are indirect, with most based on transport properties in the nanoscale
or piezoresponse force microscopy. We report the direct observation of sliding
ferroelectricity, using a high-quality amphidynamic single crystal,
(15-Crown-5)Cd$_3$Cl$_6$, which possesses a large band-gap and so allows direct
measurement of P-E hysteresis. This coordination polymer is a van der Waals
material, which is composed of inorganic stators and organic rotators as
measured using XRD and NMR characterisation. From DFT calculations, we find
that after the freezing of rotators an electric dipole is generated in each
layer driven by the geometric mechanism, meanwhile a comparable ferroelectric
polarization originates from the interlayer sliding. The net polarization of
these two components can be directly measured and manipulated. Our finding
provides insight into low-dimensional ferroelectrics, especially the
controlling of synchronous dynamics of rotating molecules and sliding layers in
solids.

In this work, we investigate the relation between the concept of
``information rate'', an information geometric method for measuring the speed
of the time evolution of the statistical states of a stochastic process, and
stochastic thermodynamics quantities like entropy rate and entropy production.
Then, we propose the application of entropy rate and entropy production to
different practical applications such as abrupt event detection, correlation
analysis, and control engineering. Specifically, by utilising the Fokker-Planck
equation of multi-variable linear stochastic processes described by Langevin
equations, we calculate the exact value for information rate, entropy rate, and
entropy production and derive various inequalities among them. Inspired by
classical correlation coefficients and control techniques, we create
entropic-informed correlation coefficients as abrupt event detection methods
and information geometric cost functions as optimal thermodynamic control
policies, respectively. The methods are analysed via the numerical simulations
of common prototypical systems.

Due to the resource criticality of rare-earths (RE), an alternative to the
well-known Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B magnets with a lower amount of critical elements is
required. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
investigate the influence of partial Nd substitution with more abundant
elements (X: Y and Ce) in ThMn$_{12}$-type (Nd,X)Fe$_{11}$Ti compounds were
performed. In order to have a systematic understanding, the intrinsic magnetic
properties such as the saturation magnetization $M_S$, Curie temperature $T_C$
and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, are screened starting from binaries
RFe$_{12}$ (R: Y, Ce and Nd), and only considering the spin magnetic
contribution in case of the $f$ electrons. Ti is considered for the
thermodynamic stabilization and different concentrations of Ti are taken into
account for ternaries RFe$_{12-y}$Ti$_y$ and quaternaries
(Nd,X)Fe$_{12-y}$Ti$_y$ (0.5$\le$ $y$ $\le$1). In addition, the effect of
nitrogenation is examined for each considered compound. In case of
(Nd,Y)Fe$_{11}$Ti, $|BH|$$_{max}$ is found to be 384 kJ/m$^3$ and $T_C$ is
calculated to be 595 K. Similarly, $|BH|$$_{max}$ and $T_C$ are calculated to
be 365 kJ/m$^3$ and 593 K for (Nd,Ce)Fe$_{11}$Ti magnet, respectively. Both 50

Recent solidification experiments identified an oscillatory growth
instability during directional solidification of Ni-based superalloy CMSX4
under a given range of cooling rates. From a modeling perspective, the
quantitative simulation of dendritic growth under convective conditions remains
challenging, due to the multiple length scales involved. Using the dendritic
needle network (DNN) model, coupled with an efficient Navier-Stokes solver, we
reproduced the buoyancy-induced growth oscillations observed in CMSX4
directional solidification. These previous results have shown that, for a given
alloy and temperature gradient, oscillations occur in a narrow range of cooling
rates (or pulling velocity, $V_p$) and that the selected primary dendrite arm
spacing ($\Lambda$) plays a crucial role in the activation of the flow leading
to oscillations. Here, we show that the oscillatory behavior may be generalized
to other binary alloys within an appropriate range of $(V_p,\Lambda)$ by
reproducing it for an Al-4at.%Cu alloy. We perform a mapping of oscillatory
states as a function of $V_p$ and $\Lambda$, and identify the regions of
occurrence of different behaviors (e.g., sustained or damped oscillations) and
their effect on the oscillation characteristics. Our results suggest a minimum
of $V_p$ for the occurrence of oscillations and confirm the correlation between
the oscillation type (namely: damped, sustained, or noisy) with the ratio of
average fluid velocity $\overline V$ over $V_p$. We describe the different
observed growth regimes and highlight similarities and contrasts with our
previous results for a CMSX4 alloy.

Applications of the M\"ossbauer spectroscopy (MS) in the investigation of
Fe-Cr alloys are reviewed. A high sensitivity of the hyperfine magnetic field
to the presence of Cr atoms in the vicinity of the probe Fe atoms permits
quantitative investigation of various aspects related both to the
crystallographic as well as to the magnetic phase diagram of this alloy system.
Concerning the former, presented is the relevance of MS for determining borders
of the miscibility gap and kinetics of the phase decomposition, distinguishing
between nucleation and growth and spinodal decomposition, identifying the
sigma-phase and studying kinetics of its precipitation. Regarding the magnetic
phase diagram, MS is useful for determining the Curie, the N\'eel and the
spin-freezing temperature, hence studying paramagnetic-ferromagnetic,
paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic-spin-glass transitions. An
effect of different heat treatments, strain and irradiation with various
particles on a distribution of Cr atoms in the Fe matrix is demonstrated, too.
For bcc-FeCr alloys relevance of MS for determining changes in spin and charge
densities at Fe-sites induced by neighboring Cr atoms is illustrated, as well
as its usefulness in studying changes caused by a high-temperature sulphidation
and oxidation. Concerning properties of sigma-FeCr alloys the application of MS
for determining the Curie and Debye temperature is reviewed. Application of MS
to study an effect of magnetism on the lattice dynamics of Fe atoms in
sigma-FeCr is also exemplified. Last but not least, determining a magnetic
texture and mechanical alloying is addressed.

Grain growth competition during solidification determines microstructural
features, such as dendritic arm spacings, segregation pattern, and grain
texture, which have a key impact on the final mechanical properties. During
metal additive manufacturing (AM), these features are highly sensitive to
manufacturing conditions, such as laser power and scanning speed. The melt pool
(MP) geometry is also expected to have a strong influence on microstructure
selection. Here, taking advantage of a computationally efficient multi-GPU
implementation of a quantitative phase-field model, we use two-dimensional
cross-section simulations of a shrinking MP during metal AM, at the scale of
the full MP, in order to explore the resulting mechanisms of grain growth
competition and texture selection. We explore MPs of different aspect ratios,
different initial (substrate) grain densities, and repeat each simulation
several times with different random grain distributions and orientations along
the fusion line in order to obtain a statistically relevant picture of grain
texture selection mechanisms. Our results show a transition from a weak to a
strong $\langle10\rangle$ texture when the aspect ratio of the melt pool
deviates from unity. This is attributed to the shape and directions of thermal
gradients during solidification, and seems more pronounced in the case of wide
melt pools than in the case of a deeper one. The texture transition was not
found to notably depend upon the initial grain density along the fusion line
from which the melt pool solidifies epitaxially.

<h3>Random Walk on a Rough Surface: Renormalization Group Analysis of a  Simple Model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The field theoretic renormalization group is applied to a simple model of
random walk on a rough fluctuating surface. We consider the Fokker--Planck
equation for a particle in a uniform gravitational field. The surface is
modelled by the generalized Edwards--Wilkinson linear stochastic equation for
the height field. The full stochastic model is reformulated as a
multiplicatively renormalizable field theory, which allows for application of
the standard renormalization theory. The renormalization group equations have
several fixed points that correspond to possible scaling regimes in the
infrared range (long times, large distances); all the critical dimensions are
found exactly. As an example, the spreading law for particle's cloud is
derived. It has the form $R^2(t)\simeq t^{2/\Delta_{\omega}}$ with the exactly
known critical dimension of frequency $\Delta_{\omega}$ and, in general,
differs from the standard expression $R^2(t)\simeq t$ for ordinary random walk.

<h3>The θ-formulation of the 2D elastica -- Buckling and boundary layer  theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
The equations of a planar elastica under pressure can be rewritten in a
useful form by parametrising the variables in terms of the local orientation
angle, $\theta$, instead of the arc length. This ``$\theta$-formulation'' lends
itself to a particularly easy boundary layer analysis in the limit of weak
bending stiffness. Within this parameterization, boundary layers are located at
inflexion points, where $\theta$ is extremum, and they connect regions of low
and large curvature. A simple composite solution is derived without resorting
to elliptic functions and integrals. This approximation can be used as an
elementary building block to describe complex shapes. Applying this theory to
the study of an elastic ring under uniform pressure and subject to a set of
point forces, we discover a snapping instability. This instability is confirmed
by numerical simulations. Finally, we carry out experiments and find good
agreement of the theory with the experimental shape of the deformed elastica.

<h3>Effect of ZrB2 additions on the thermal stability of polycrystalline  diamond</h3>

<br>
This study investigates the effect of ZrB2 additions on the microstructure,
thermal stability, and thermo-mechanical wear behaviour of polycrystalline
diamond. Following high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) sintering, the
ZrB2-PCD material showed a full conversion of the binder phase to cobalt-boride
(Co2B and Co23B6) phases. In-situ PXRD and TEM vacuum annealing experiments
observed that the onset of bulk graphitisation occurred above $1000^{\circ}C$
for the ZrB2-PCD material, compared to $850^{\circ}C$ for the STD-PCD material.
The ZrB2-PCD tools showed excellent thermo-mechanical wear behaviour,
exhibiting increased durability and a steady wear scar progression during
high-temperature dry-VTL testing. However, lowered abrasion wear resistance was
observed for the ZrB2-PCD tools during low-temperature wet-VTL testing,
probably due the reduced diamond contiguity in the ZrB2 additive sample.
Further optimisation of the ZrB2 additive phase content, mixing methodology, or
sintering conditions could be explored to improve the abrasive wear resistance
of this novel PCD material.

<br>
T91 samples were exposed to static liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) at
700{\deg}C for 250-500 hours in either an oxidising or reducing environment.
Corrosion damage was characterised using electron microscopy techniques, which
identified networks of LBE intrusion beneath LBE-wetted surfaces. Under
reducing conditions these networks are uniformly distributed, while they appear
patchier and deeper under oxidising conditions. The individual intrusions
preferentially follow microstructural features, initially along prior-austenite
grain boundaries, followed by penetration down martensite lath boundaries.
Local depletion of Cr was observed within 4 {\mu}m of the intrusions and along
intersecting boundaries, suggesting local Cr dissolution as the main corrosion
mechanism.

<br>
<br>
The bulk-boundary correspondence is a key concept in topological quantum
materials. For instance, a quantum spin Hall insulator features a bulk
insulating gap with gapless helical boundary states protected by the underlying
Z2 topology. However, the bulk-boundary dichotomy and distinction are rarely
explored in optical experiments, which can provide unique information about
topological charge carriers beyond transport and electronic spectroscopy
techniques. Here, we utilize mid-infrared absorption micro-spectroscopy and
pump-probe micro-spectroscopy to elucidate the bulk-boundary optical responses
of Bi4Br4, a recently discovered room-temperature quantum spin Hall insulator.
Benefiting from the low energy of infrared photons and the high spatial
resolution, we unambiguously resolve a strong absorption from the boundary
states while the bulk absorption is suppressed by its insulating gap. Moreover,
the boundary absorption exhibits a strong polarization anisotropy, consistent
with the one-dimensional nature of the topological boundary states. Our
infrared pump-probe microscopy further measures a substantially increased
carrier lifetime for the boundary states, which reaches one nanosecond scale.
The nanosecond lifetime is about one to two orders longer than that of most
topological materials and can be attributed to the linear dispersion nature of
the helical boundary states. Our findings demonstrate the optical bulk-boundary
dichotomy in a topological material and provide a proof-of-principal
methodology for studying topological optoelectronics.

Short, partially complementary, single-stranded (ss)DNA strands can form
nanostructures with a wide variety of shapes and mechanical properties. It is
well known that semiflexible, linear dsDNA can undergo an isotropic to nematic
(IN) phase transition and that sufficiently bent structures can form a biaxial
nematic phase. Here we use numerical simulations to explore how the phase
behaviour of linear DNA constructs changes as we tune the mechanical properties
of the constituent DNA by changing the nucleotide sequence. The IN phase
transition can be suppressed in so-called DNA 'nunchakus': structures
consisting of two rigid dsDNA arms, separated by a sufficiently flexible
spacer. In this paper, we use simulations to explore what phase behavior to
expect for different linear DNA constructs. To this end, we first performed
numerical simulations exploring the structural properties of a number of
different DNA oligonucleotides, using the oxDNA package. We then used the
structural information generated in the oxDNA simulations to construct more
coarse-grained models of the rodlike, bent-core, and nunchaku DNA. These
coarse-grained models were used to explore the phase behavior of suspensions of
the various DNA constructs. The approach explored in this paper makes it
possible to 'design' the phase behavior of DNA constructs by a suitable choice
of the constituent nucleotide sequence.

<h3>Determination of Local Short-Range Order in TiVNbHf(Al)</h3>

The presence of short-range chemical order can be a key factor in determining
the mechanical behavior of metals, but directly and unambiguously determining
its distribution in complex concentrated alloy systems can be challenging.
Here, we directly identify and quantify chemical order in the globally single
phase BCC-TiVNbHf(Al) system using aberration corrected scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) paired with spatial statistics methods. To overcome
the difficulties of short-range order (SRO) quantification with STEM when the
components of an alloy exhibit large atomic number differences and near
equiatomic ratios, 'null hypothesis' tests are used to separate experiment from
a random chemical distribution. Experiment is found to deviate from both the
case of an ideal random solid solution and a fully ordered structure with
statistical significance. We also identify local chemical order in TiVNbHf and
confirm and quantify the enhancement of SRO with the addition of Al. These
results provide insights into local chemical order in the promising TiVNbHf(Al)
refractory alloys while highlighting the utility of spatial statistics in
characterizing nanoscale SRO in compositionally complex systems.

<h3>Thermal fading of the $1/k^4$-tail of the momentum distribution induced  by the hole anomaly</h3>

<br>
We provide the first ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo calculation of the
momentum distribution in a one-dimensional repulsive Bose gas at finite
temperatures. We explore all interaction and thermal regimes. An important
reference temperature is that of the hole anomaly, observed as a peak in the
specific heat and a maximum in the chemical potential. We find that at large
momentum $k$ and temperature above the anomaly threshold, the universal tail
$\mathcal{C}/k^4$ of the distribution (proportional to the Tan's contact
$\mathcal{C}$) is screened by the $1/|k|^3$-term due to a dramatic thermal
increase of the internal energy. The same fading is consistently revealed in
the short-distance behavior of the one-body density matrix (OBDM) where the
$|x|^3$-dependence disappears for temperatures above the anomaly. At very high
temperatures, the OBDM and the momentum distribution approach the Gaussian of
classical gases. We obtain a new and general analytic tail for the momentum
distribution and a minimum $k$ fixing its range of validity, both calculated
with Bethe-Ansatz and valid for any interaction strength and temperature.

Phosphorescent emissions at room temperature from solid-state self sustained
film fabricated using phenazine derivative molecules blended in a solution of
poly(methyl methacrylate) were investigated at steady-state experimental
conditions. Stripe excitation by a pulsed laser at different levels of
intensities and different lengths of stripes, originates a guided emission up
to the edge of the film, enabling us to assume higher gain characteristics for
triplet states of the medium, due to the relatively higher contribution of the
total integrated area for the phosphorescent part of the emission spectra.

We investigated the effect of nano-structuring by high pressure torsion (HPT)
on the irradiation performance of Eurofer-97. Material was deformed to shear
strains from 0 to ~230, and then exposed to Fe$^{3+}$ irradiation doses of 0.01
and 0.1 displacements-per-atom (dpa). Nanoindentation hardness increases
monotonically with irradiation and deformation. For both damage levels, less
irradiation hardening is observed in severely deformed material. This effect is
most prominent in strain range ~60 to ~160, suggesting that nano-structuring
may provide an approach for reducing irradiation hardening.

<h3>Suspensions of viscoelastic capsules: effect of membrane viscosity on  transient dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Membrane viscosity is known to play a central role in the transient dynamics
of isolated viscoelastic capsules by decreasing their deformation, inducing
shape oscillations and reducing the loading time, that is, the time required to
reach the steady-state deformation. However, for dense suspensions of capsules,
our understanding of the influence of the membrane viscosity is minimal. In
this work, we perform a systematic numerical investigation based on coupled
immersed boundary -- lattice Boltzmann (IB-LB) simulations of viscoelastic
spherical capsule suspensions in the non-inertial regime. We show the effect of
the membrane viscosity on the transient dynamics as a function of volume
fraction and capillary number. Our results indicate that the influence of
membrane viscosity on both deformation and loading time strongly depends on the
volume fraction in a non-trivial manner: dense suspensions with large surface
viscosity are more resistant to deformation but attain loading times that are
characteristic of capsules with no surface viscosity, thus opening the
possibility to obtain richer combinations of mechanical features.

Non-Hermitian two-site ``dimers'' serve as minimal models in which to explore
the interplay of gain and loss in dynamical systems. In this paper, we
experimentally and theoretically investigate the dynamics of non-Hermitian
dimer models with non-reciprocal hoppings between the two sites. We investigate
two types of non-Hermitian couplings; one is when asymmetric hoppings are
externally introduced, and the other is when the non-reciprocal hoppings depend
on the population imbalance between the two sites, thus introducing the
non-Hermiticity in a dynamical manner. We engineer the models in our synthetic
mechanical set-up comprised of two classical harmonic oscillators coupled by
measurement-based feedback. For fixed non-reciprocal hoppings, we observe that,
when the strength of these hoppings is increased, there is an expected
transition from a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime, where oscillations in the
population are stable and bounded, to a $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime, where the
oscillations are unstable and the population grows/decays exponentially.
However, when the non-Hermiticity is dynamically introduced, we also find a
third intermediate regime in which these two behaviors coexist, meaning that we
can tune from stable to unstable population dynamics by simply changing the
initial phase difference between the two sites. As we explain, this behavior
can be understood by theoretically exploring the emergent fixed points of a
related dimer model in which the non-reciprocal hoppings depends on the
normalized population imbalance. Our study opens the way for the future
exploration of non-Hermitian dynamics and exotic lattice models in synthetic
mechanical networks.

We develop a fully data-driven model of anisotropic finite viscoelasticity
using neural ordinary differential equations as building blocks. We replace the
Helmholtz free energy function and the dissipation potential with data-driven
functions that a priori satisfy physics-based constraints such as objectivity
and the second law of thermodynamics. Our approach enables modeling
viscoelastic behavior of materials under arbitrary loads in three-dimensions
even with large deformations and large deviations from the thermodynamic
equilibrium. The data-driven nature of the governing potentials endows the
model with much needed flexibility in modeling the viscoelastic behavior of a
wide class of materials. We train the model using stress-strain data from
biological and synthetic materials including humain brain tissue, blood clots,
natural rubber and human myocardium and show that the data-driven method
outperforms traditional, closed-form models of viscoelasticity.

Micromechanical constitutive parameters are important for many engineering
materials, typically in microelectronic applications and material design. Their
accurate identification poses a three-fold experimental challenge: (i)
deformation of the microstructure is observable only at small scales, requiring
SEM or other microscopy techniques; (ii) external loadings are applied at a
(larger) engineering or device scale; and (iii) material parameters typically
depend on the applied manufacturing process, necessitating measurements on
material produced with the same process. In this paper, micromechanical
parameter identification in heterogeneous solids is addressed through
multiscale experiments combined with Integrated Digital Image Correlation
(IDIC) in conjunction with various possible computational homogenization
schemes. To this end, some basic concepts underlying multiscale approaches
available in the literature are first reviewed, discussing their respective
advantages and disadvantages from the computational as well as experimental
point of view. A link is made with recently introduced uncoupled methods, which
allow for identification of material parameter ratios at the microscale, still
lacking a proper normalization. Two multiscale methods are analysed, allowing
to bridge the gap between microstructural kinematics and macroscopically
measured forces, providing the required normalization. It is shown that an
integrated experimental--computational scheme provides relaxed requirements on
scale separation. The accuracy and performance of the discussed techniques are
analysed by means of virtual experimentation under plane strain and large
strain assumptions for unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites. The
robustness against image noise is also assessed.

We provide a comprehensive reply to the comment written by Chiara Angelini
and Federico Ricci-Tersenghi [arXiv:2206.13211] and argue that the comment
singles out one particular non-representative example problem, entirely
focusing on the maximum independent set (MIS) on sparse graphs, for which
greedy algorithms are expected to perform well. Conversely, we highlight the
broader algorithmic development underlying our original work, and (within our
original framework) provide additional numerical results showing sizable
improvements over our original results, thereby refuting the comment's
performance statements. We also provide results showing run-time scaling
superior to the results provided by Angelini and Ricci-Tersenghi. Furthermore,
we show that the proposed set of random d-regular graphs does not provide a
universal set of benchmark instances, nor do greedy heuristics provide a
universal algorithmic baseline. Finally, we argue that the internal (parallel)
anatomy of graph neural networks is very different from the (sequential) nature
of greedy algorithms and emphasize that graph neural networks have demonstrated
their potential for superior scalability compared to existing heuristics such
as parallel tempering. We conclude by discussing the conceptual novelty of our
work and outline some potential extensions.

Freezing of water droplets placed on the bare and superhydrophobic surfaces
of polymer wedges are studied both experimentally and computationally.
Two-dimensional numerical calculations of the transient temperature field in a
chilled polymer wedge show that the direction of heat flux from the droplet
through the thermal contact region with the wedge differs significantly from
the normal to the wedge surface. This is the physical cause of the recently
observed asymmetric cooling of the droplet. A novel approximate computational
model is proposed that takes into account the variable area of the water
freezing front in the droplet. This model gives a quantitative estimate of the
faster freezing of the droplet on the bare surface. The obtained numerical
results agree with the data of laboratory experiments. The velocity of the
crystallization front and the droplet deformation including the so-called
freezing tip formation are monitored in the experiment. The direction of the
freezing cone axis appears to be noticeably different for the cases of bare and
superhydrophobic wedge surfaces. This deviation is explained by the fact that
the direction of the freezing cone axis is controlled by the local direction of
the heat flux. For a hydrophobic wedge surface, the deviation of the freezing
tip from the vertical is smaller, because the reduced thermal contact area
reduces the influence of the heat flux direction at the wedge surface.

Willis dynamic homogenization theory revealed that the effective linear
momentum of elastic composites is coupled to their effective strain. Recent
generalization of Willis' dynamic homogenization theory to the case of
piezoelectric composites further revealed that their effective linear momentum
is also coupled to the effective electric field. Here, we introduce the
simplest possible model a one-dimensional discrete model that exhibits this
so-called electromomentum coupling in subwavelength composites. We utilize our
model to elucidate the physical origins of this phenomenon, illustrate its
mechanism, and identify local resonances which lead to elevated Willis- and
electromomentum coupling in narrow frequency bands. The results provide
intuitive guidelines for the design of this coupling in piezoelectric
metamaterials.

As the first magnetic kagome material to exhibit the charge density wave
(CDW) order, FeGe has attracted much attention in recent studies. Similar to
AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Cs, Rb), FeGe exhibits the CDW pattern with an
in-plane 2$\times $2 structure and the existence of van Hove singularities
(vHSs) near the Fermi level. However, sharply different from AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$
which has phonon instability at $M$ point, all the theoretically calculated
phonon frequencies in FeGe remain positive. Here, we perform a comprehensive
study of the band structures, Fermi surfaces and nesting function of FeGe
through first-principles calculations. Surprisingly, we find that the maximum
of nesting function is at $K$ point instead of $M$ point. Two Fermi pockets
with Fe-$d_{xz}$ and Fe-$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$/$d_{xy}$ orbital characters have
large contribution to the Fermi nesting, which evolve significantly with
$k_{z}$, indicating the highly three-dimensional (3D) feature of FeGe in
contrast to AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Meanwhile, the vHSs are close to the Fermi
surface only in a small $k_{z}$ range, and does not play a leading role in
nesting function. Considering the effect of local Coulomb interaction, we
reveal that the Fermi level eigenstates nested by vector $K$ are mainly
distributed from unequal sublattice occupancy, thus the instability at $K$
point is significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, the wave functions nested by
vector $M$ have many ingredients located at the same Fe site, thus the
instability at $M$ point is enhanced. This indicates that the electron
correlation, rather than electron-phonon interaction, plays a key role in the
CDW transition at $M$ point.

Controlling the vortex chirality in ferromagnetic nanodots and nanorings has
been a topic of investigation for the last few years. Many control methods have
been proposed and it has been found that the control is related to the breaking
of the circular symmetry. In this paper, we present a theoretical study
demonstrating the control of chirality in ferromagnetic nanoring without
directly breaking its symmetry, but instead by placing elongated ferromagnetic
nanoelement inside the ring, Here, the stray magnetostatic field exerted by the
asymmetrically placed nanoelement determines the movement of the domain walls
upon remagnetization of the nanoring and the resulting chirality in the
remanence. This approach allows the chirality of the vortex state to be
controlled and also promises its control in a dense array of nanorings, thus
suitable for spintronic and magnonic applications.

Next-generation high-efficiency Li-ion batteries require an electrolyte that
is both safe and thermally stable. A possible choice for high performance
all-solid-state Li-ion batteries is a liquid crystal, which possesses
properties in-between crystalline solids and isotropic liquids. By employing
Molecular Dynamics simulations together with various experimental techniques,
we have designed and analyzed a novel liquid crystal electrolyte composed of
rigid naphthalene-based moieties as mesogenic units, grafted to flexible alkyl
chains of different lengths. We have synthesized novel highly ordered lamellar
phase liquid crystal electrolytes at a 99% of purity, and have evaluated the
effect of the alkyl chain length variation on ionic conduction. We find that
the conductivity of the liquid crystal electrolytes is directly dependent on
the extent of the nanochannels formed by the molecules self-organization, which
itself depends non-monotonously on the size of the alkyl chains. In addition,
we show that the ion pair interaction between the anionic center of the liquid
crystal molecules and the Li+ ions plays a crucial role in the overall
conductivity. Based on our results, we suggest that further improvement of the
ionic conductivity performance is possible, making this novel family of liquid
crystal electrolytes a promising option for the design of entirely-solid-state
Li+ ion batteries.

Nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) resonator networks have drawn increasing
interest due to their potential applications in emergent behavior, sensing,
phononics, and mechanical information processing. A challenge toward realizing
these large-scale networks is the ability to controllably tune and reconfigure
the collective, macroscopic properties of the network, which relies directly on
the development of methods to characterize the constituent NEMS resonator
building blocks and their coupling. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable
optical technique to spatially map graphene NEMS networks and read out the
fixed-frequency collective response as a single vector. Using the response
vectors, we introduce an efficient algebraic approach to quantify the
site-specific elasticity, mass, damping, and coupling parameters of network
clusters. We apply this technique to accurately characterize single uncoupled
resonators and coupled resonator pairs by sampling them at just two
frequencies, and without the use of curve fitting or the associated a priori
parameter estimates. Our technique may be applied to a range of classical and
quantum resonator systems and fills in a vital gap for programming NEMS
networks.
