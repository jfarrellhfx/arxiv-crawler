<h3>Metastability of Discrete-Symmetry Flocks</h3>

We study the stability of the ordered phase of flocking models with a scalar
order parameter. Using both the active Ising model and a hydrodynamic
description, we show that droplets of particles moving in the direction
opposite to that of the ordered phase nucleate and grow. We characterize
analytically this self-similar growth and demonstrate that droplets spread
ballistically in all directions. Our results imply that, in the thermodynamic
limit, discrete-symmetry flocks -- and, by extension, continuous-symmetry
flocks with rotational anisotropy -- are metastable in all dimensions.

<h3>Shape-induced pairing of spheroidal squirmers</h3>

The "squirmer model" is a classical hydrodynamic model for the motion of
interfacially-driven microswimmers, such as self-phoretic colloids or volvocine
green algae. To date, most studies using the squirmer model have considered
spherical particles with axisymmetric distribution of surface slip. Here, we
develop a general approach to the pairing and scattering dynamics of two
spheroidal squirmers. We assume that the direction of motion of the squirmers
is restricted to a plane, which is approximately realized in many experimental
systems. In the framework of an analytically tractable kinetic model, we
predict that, for identical squirmers, an immotile "head-to-head" configuration
is stable only when the particles have oblate shape and a non-axisymmetric
distribution of surface slip. We also obtain conditions for stability of a
motile "head-to-tail" configuration: for instance, the two particles must have
unequal self-propulsion velocities. Our analytical predictions are compared
against detailed numerical calculations obtained using the boundary element
method.

We study self-assembly in a colloidal suspension of magnetic particles by
performing comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer (SM)
model which comprises of spherical particles that are decorated by a magnetic
moment. The SM potential incorporates dipole-dipole interactions along with the
usual Lennard-Jones interaction, and exhibits a gas-liquid phase coexistence
observed experimentally in magnetic fluids. When this system is quenched from
the high-temperature homogeneous phase to the coexistence region, the
non-equilibrium evolution to the condensed phase proceeds with the development
of spatial as well as magnetic order. We observe density-dependent coarsening
mechanisms - a diffusive growth law $\ell(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ in the nucleation
regime, and hydrodynamics-driven inertial growth law $\ell(t)\sim t^{2/3}$ in
the spinodal regimes. [$\ell(t)$ is the average size of the condensate at time
$t$ after the quench.] While the spatial growth is governed by the expected
conserved order parameter dynamics, the growth of magnetic order in the
spinodal regime exhibits unexpected non-conserved dynamics. The equilibrium
morphologies have density-dependent shapes which typically include the
isotropic sphere and spherical bubble morphologies in the nucleation region,
and the anisotropic cylinder, planar slab, cylindrical bubble morphologies in
the spinodal region. The structures are robust and non-volatile and exhibit
characteristic magnetic properties. For example, the oppositely magnetized
hemispheres in the spherical morphology impart the characteristics of a {\it
Janus particle} to it. The observed structures have versatile applications in
catalysis, drug delivery systems, memory devices and magnetic photonic crystals
to name a few.

<h3>Unitary k-designs from random number-conserving quantum circuits</h3>

Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of
applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global $U(1)$
charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random
circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We
establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated
circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble
that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group
of number conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design
with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear
dimension $L$. Second, for $k < k_c$, the depth $\tau$ to converge to a
$k$-design scales as $\tau \gtrsim k L^{d+2}$. In contrast, without number
conservation $\tau \gtrsim k L^{d}$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is
controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum
statistical model which spontaneously breaks $k$ $U(1)$ symmetries. The
associated Goldstone modes are gapless and lead to the predicted scaling of
$\tau$. Our variational bounds hold for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions;
we conjecture they are tight.

<h3>Finite-temperature critical behaviors in 2D long-range quantum  Heisenberg model</h3>

The well-known Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits the existence of
finite-temperature spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking phase in systems
with short-range interactions at spatial dimension $D\le 2$ [Phys. Rev. 158,
383; Phys. Rev. Lett. 17, 1133; Journal of Statistical Physics 175, 521-529].
For long-range interaction with monotonic power-law form ($1/r^{\alpha}$), the
theorem further forbids a ferro- or antiferromagnetic order at finite
temperature when $\alpha\ge 2D$[Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 137203]. However, the
situation for $\alpha \in (2,4)$ at $D=2$ is beyond the predicting power of the
theorem and the situation is still unclear. Here we address this question by
large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, accompanied with field theoretical
analysis. We find the spontaneous breaking of the $SU(2)$ symmetry for $\alpha
\in (2,4)$ in ferromagnetic Heisenberg model with $1/r^{\alpha}$ interaction at
$D=2$, and obtain the accurate critical exponents by finite-size analysis for
$\alpha<3$ where the system is above the upper critical dimension with Gaussian
fixed point and for $3\le\alpha<4$ where the system is below the upper critical
dimension with non-Gaussian fixed point. Our results reveal the novel critical
behaviors in 2D long-range Heisenberg models and will intrigue further
experimental studies of quantum materials with long-range interaction beyond
the realm of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.

<h3>Universal and non-universal features of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory  with finite-range interactions</h3>

We study analytic solutions to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) gap
equation for isotropic superconductors with finite-range interaction potentials
over the full range of temperatures from absolute zero to the superconducting
critical temperature, $0\leq T\leq T_c$. Using these solutions,
$\Delta(\epsilon,T)$, we provide a novel proof of the universality of the
temperature dependence of the BCS gap ratio at the Fermi level,
$\Delta(\epsilon=0,T)/T_c$. Moreover, by examining the behavior of this ratio
as a function of energy, $\epsilon$, we find that non-universal features emerge
away from the Fermi level, and these features take the form of a temperature
independent multiplicative factor, $F(\epsilon)$, which is equal to
$\Delta(\epsilon,T)/\Delta(\epsilon=0,T)$ up to exponentially small
corrections, i.e., the error terms vanish like $\rm{e}^{-1/\lambda}$ in the
weak-coupling limit $\lambda\rightarrow 0$. We discuss the model-dependent
features of both $F(\epsilon)$ and $T_c$, and we illustrate their behavior
focusing on several concrete examples of physically-relevant finite-range
potentials. Comparing these cases for fixed coupling constants, we highlight
the importance of the functional form of the interaction potential in
determining the size of the critical temperature and provide guidelines for
choosing potentials which lead to higher values of $T_c$. We also propose
experimental signatures which could be used to probe the energy-dependence of
the gap and potentially shed light on the underlying mechanisms giving rise to
superconductivity.

The room temperature hole conductivity of the ultra wide bandgap
semiconductor beta Ga2O3 is a pre-requisite for developing the next-generation
electronic and optoelectronic devices based on this oxide. In this work,
high-quality p-type beta-Ga2O3 thin films grown on r-plane sapphire substrate
by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) exhibit Rho = 50000Ohm.cm
resistivity at room temperature. A low activation energy of conductivity as
Ea2=170 meV was determined, associated to the oxygen - gallium native acceptor
defect complex. Further, taking advantage of cation (Zn) doping, the
conductivity of Ga2O3:Zn film was remarkably increased by three orders of
magnitude, showing a long-time stable room-temperature hole conductivity with
the conductivity activation energy of around 86 meV.

The fabrication of assembled structures of topological defects in liquid
crystals (LCs) has attracted much attention during the last decade, stemming
from the potential application of these defects in modern technologies. A range
of techniques can be employed to create large areas of engineered defects in
LCs, including mechanical shearing, chemical surface treatment, external
fields, or geometric confinement. The technology of 3D printing has recently
emerged as a powerful method to fabricate novel patterning topographies
inaccessible by other microfabrication techniques, especially confining
geometries with curved topographies. In this work, we show the advantages of
using 3D-printed curved surfaces and controlled anchoring properties to confine
LCs and engineer new structures of topological defects, whose structure we
elucidate by comparison with a novel application of Landau-de Gennes free
energy minimization to the smectic A-nematic phase transition. We also
demonstrate the ability of these defects to act as a scaffold for assembling
gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) into reconfigurable 3D structures. We discuss the
characteristics of this templated self-assembly (TSA) approach and explain the
relationship between NP concentrations and defect structures with insights
gained from numerical modeling. This work paves the way for a versatile
platform of LC defect-templated assembly of a range of functional nanomaterials
useful in the field of energy technology.

A new cage-structured compound - HfMn$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ - belonging to the
AB$_{2}$C$_{20}$ (A, B = transition or rare earth metals, and C = Al, Zn, or
Cd) family of structures has been synthesized via the self-flux method. The new
compound crystallizes in the space group Fd-3m with lattice parameter a =
14.0543(2) \r{A} (Z = 8) and exhibits non-stoichiometry due to Mn/Zn mixing on
the Mn-site and an underoccupied Hf-site. The structure refines to
Hf$_{0.93}$Mn$_{1.63}$Zn$_{20.37}$ and follows lattice size trends when
compared to other HfM$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) structures. The
magnetic measurements show that this compound displays a modified Curie-Weiss
behavior with a transition temperature around 22 K. The magnetization shows no
saturation, a small magnetic moment, and near negligible hysteresis, all signs
of the itinerant magnetism.

<h3>Waterlike density anomaly in fermions</h3>

In this work we explore the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model as a fluid
system modelling liquid phases of different densities. This model naturally
displays two length scales of interaction, which are connected with waterlike
anomalies. We analyze the density anomaly as a function of the model
parameters, namely the hopping, on-site and first neighbor interactions. We
show that this anomaly is present for a wide range of model parameters and is
connected to a ground-state liquid-liquid critical point.

<h3>Constraints on proximity-induced ferromagnetism in a Dirac semimetal  (Cd$_3$As$_2$)/ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sb)  heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Breaking time-reversal symmetry in a Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ through
doping with magnetic ions or by the magnetic proximity effect is expected to
cause a transition to other topological phases (such as a Weyl semimetal). To
this end, we investigate the possibility of proximity-induced ferromagnetic
ordering in epitaxial Dirac semimetal (Cd$_3$As$_2$)/ferromagnetic
semiconductor (Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Sb) heterostructures grown by molecular beam
epitaxy. We report the comprehensive characterization of these heterostructures
using structural probes (atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning
transmission electron microscopy), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,
electrical magneto-transport, magnetometry, and polarized neutron
reflectometry. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect in the
temperature range 2 K - 20 K show signatures that could be consistent with
either a proximity effect or spin-dependent scattering of charge carriers in
the Cd$_3$As$_2$ channel. Polarized neutron reflectometry sets constraints on
the interpretation of the magnetotransport studies by showing that (at least
for temperatures above 6 K) any induced magnetization in the Cd$_3$As$_2$
itself must be relatively small ($<$ 14 emu/cm$^3$).

Electrical pulse stimulation drives many important physical phenomena in
condensed matter as well as in electronic systems and devices. Often,
nanoscopic and mesoscopic mechanisms are hypothesized, but methods to image
electrically driven dynamics on both their native length and time scales have
so far been largely undeveloped. Here, we present an ultrafast electron
microscopy approach that uses electrical pulses to induce dynamics and records
both the local time-resolved electric field and corresponding material behavior
with nanometer-nanosecond spatiotemporal resolution. Quantitative measurement
of the time-dependent field via the electron beam deflection is demonstrated by
recording the field between two electrodes with single-ns temporal resolution.
We then show that this can be applied in a material by correlating applied
field with resulting dynamics in TaS$_{2}$. First, time-resolved electron
diffraction is used to simultaneously record the electric field and crystal
structure change in a selected region during a 20 ns voltage pulse, showing how
a charge density wave transition evolves during and after the applied field.
Then, time-resolved nanoimaging is demonstrated, revealing heterogeneous
distortions that occur in the freestanding flake during a longer, lower
amplitude pulse. Altogether, these results pave the way for future experiments
that will uncover the nanoscale dynamics underlying electrically driven
phenomena.

<h3>Symmetry and stability of orientationally ordered collective motions of  self-propelled, semiflexible filaments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01180" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01180</a>
<br>
<i>Madhuvanthi Guruprasad Athani, Daniel A. Beller</i>
<br>
<br>
Ordered, collective motions commonly arise spontaneously in systems of many
interacting, active units, ranging from cellular tissues and bacterial colonies
to self-propelled colloids and animal flocks. Active phases are especially rich
when the active units are sufficiently anisotropic to produce liquid
crystalline order and thus active nematic phenomena, with important biophysical
examples provided by cytoskeletal filaments including microtubules and actin.
Gliding assay experiments have provided a testbed to study the collective
motions of these cytoskeletal filaments and unlocked diverse collective active
phases, including states with long-range orientational order. However, it is
not well-understood how such long-range order emerges from the interplay of
passive and active aligning mechanisms. We use Brownian dynamics simulations to
study the collective motions of semiflexible filaments that self-propel in
quasi-two dimensions, in order to gain insights into the aligning mechanisms at
work in these gliding assay systems. We find that, without aligning torques in
the microscopic model, long-range orientational order can only be achieved when
the filaments are able to overlap. The symmetry (nematic or polar) of the
long-range order that first emerges is shown to depend on the energy cost of
filament overlap and on filament flexibility. However, our model also predicts
that a long-range-ordered active nematic state is merely transient, whereas
long-range polar order is the only active dynamical steady state in systems
with finite filament rigidity.

<h3>Interferometry of Efimov states in thermal gases by modulated magnetic  fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01199</a>
<br>
<i>G. Bougas, S. I. Mistakidis, P. Schmelcher, C. H. Greene, P. Giannakeas</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that an interferometer based on modulated magnetic field
pulses enables precise characterization of the energies and lifetimes of Efimov
trimers irrespective of the magnitude and sign of the interactions in 85Rb
thermal gases. Despite thermal effects, interference fringes develop when the
dark time between the pulses is varied. This enables the selective excitation
of coherent superpositions of trimer, dimer and free atom states. The
interference patterns possess two distinct damping timescales at short and long
dark times that are either equal to or twice as long as the lifetime of Efimov
trimers, respectively. Specifically, this behavior at long dark times provides
an interpretation of the unusually large damping timescales reported in a
recent experiment with 7Li thermal gases [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 200402 (2019)].
Apart from that, our results constitute a stepping stone towards a high
precision few-body state interferometry for dense quantum gases.

<h3>Robust and tunable coreless vortices and fractional vortices in chiral  $d$-wave superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01202" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01202</a>

<i>Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<br>
<br>
Chiral $d$-wave superconductivity has recently been proposed in a wide range
of materials based on both experiment and theoretical works. Chiral
superconductors host a finite Chern number set by the winding of the
superconducting order parameter and associated topologically protected chiral
edge modes. However, the chiral edge currents and orbital angular momentum
(OAM) generated by the edge modes are not topologically protected and another,
more robust, experimental probe is therefore needed to facilitate experimental
verification of chiral $d$-wave superconductors. We have recently shown the
appearance of quadruply quantized coreless vortices (CVs) in chiral $d$-wave
superconductors, consisting of a closed domain wall decorated with eight
fractional vortices, and generating a smoking-gun signature of the Chern
number, chirality, and the superconducting pairing symmetry [P. Holmvall and A.
M. Black-Schaffer, arXiv:2212.08156 (2023)]. Specifically, the CV spontaneously
breaks axial symmetry for parallel chirality and vorticity, with a signature
appearing directly in the local density of states (LDOS) measurable with
scanning-tunneling spectroscopy (STS). In this work, we first demonstrate a
strong tunability of the CV size and shape directly reflected in the LDOS and
then show that the LDOS signature is robust in the presence of regular
Abrikosov vortices, strong confinement, system and normal-state anisotropy,
different Fermi surfaces (FSs), non-degenerate order parameters, and even
non-magnetic impurities. In conclusion, our work establishes CVs as a tunable
and robust signature of chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

These lecture notes give a brief introduction to the so-called Fermi-polaron
problem, which explores the behaviour of a mobile impurity introduced into an
ideal Fermi gas. While this problem has been considered now for more than a
decade in ultracold atomic gases, it continues to generate surprises and
insights as new quantum mixtures emerge, both in atomic gases and in the solid
state. Here we summarise the basic theory for the Fermi polaron with a focus on
the three-dimensional case, although the results can be straightforwardly
generalised to two dimensions. Our aim is to provide a pedagogical treatment of
the subject and we thus cover fundamental topics such as scattering theory and
renormalisation. We discuss the ground state of the Fermi polaron and how it is
connected to the phase diagram of the spin-imbalanced Fermi gas, and we also
give a brief overview of the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics.
Throughout, we highlight how the static and dynamic behaviour of the Fermi
polaron is well described using intuitive variational approaches.

One of the signatures of superconductivity is the formation of the Abrikosov
vortex lattice in type-II superconductors in the presence of an external
magnetic field. Here, we study the near-field radiative heat transfer between a
spherical nanoparticle and a nearby planar substrate, both made of
optimally-doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We show that the heat flux
displays a periodic spatial pattern congruent with the material optical
response modulated by the Abrikosov lattice. Our results enrich the toolbox of
methods available to study non-conventional superconductivity.

We study one-dimensional strongly interacting spinor gases in an optical
lattice using a generalized effective spin-chain model. The spinor gas is
mapped to a system of spinless fermions and a spin-chain. A generalized
effective spin-chain Hamiltonian is developed. The developed Hamiltonian acts
on the mapped system to study the static and dynamics properties of the spinor
gas. The generalized spin-chain model provides a computationally efficient tool
to study strongly interacting spinor gases in an optical lattice as an
alternative to existing theoretical formalism for 1D lattice systems. It allows
the study of spinor gases with arbitrary spin and statistics, providing a
generalized approach for one-dimensional strongly interacting gases. The
spin-chain formalism being simple in its definition, provides an easier tool
for study. Additionally, combining the models developed here and the one
defined previously for continuum systems, provides an approach to study them in
continuum or in lattice demonstrating the wide applicability of the spin-chain

system recreating the physics of spinor gas in 1D lattice. As an application,
it also is used to study the time evolution of a quenched system. The
spin-chain Hamiltonian is useful in the study of a multitude of interesting
phenomena arising in lattice systems such as high-$T_c$ superconductivity, the
spin-coherent Luttinger liquid and the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid

We discovered superconductivity at $T_c$ = 12 K in a layered compound
La$_2$IOs$_2$ with osmium honeycomb network. Despite heavy constituent elements
unfavorable for phonon mediated mechanism, $T_c$ is the highest among
lanthanoid iodides made of lighter elements such as La$_2$IRu$_2$ with $T_c$ =
4.8 K. Electronic anomalies are observed below 60 K similar to those observed
in La$_2$IRu$_2$ below 140 K. La$_2$IOs$_2$ is a layered 5d electron system
providing a platform to investigate the interplay between the electronic
anomaly, superconductivity, and strong magnetic field.

We investigate the nonequilibrium refrigeration of one and two-qubit systems
in a squeezed thermal bath. We characterize the performance of one and
two-qubit refrigerators in the presence of squeezed heat baths, in terms of
their coefficients of performance, cooling rates, and figures of merit. Our
results show that the performance of the refrigerators is strongly influenced
by the squeezing parameter and the number of qubits. The performance of the
two-qubit refrigerator is found to be better than that of the one-qubit
refrigerator under the same operating conditions. Our findings suggest that a
squeezed thermal bath can be a promising resource for the design of efficient
quantum refrigerators in the non-equilibrium regime.

<br>
<br>
Multiferroics are materials with a coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric
order allowing the manipulation of magnetism by applications of an electric
field through magnetoelectric coupling effects. Here we propose an idea to
design a class of multiferroics with a $d^9$ configuration using the magnetic
order in copper-oxygen layers appearing in copper oxide high-temperature
superconductors by inducing ferroelectricity. Copper-based charge transfer
multiferroics SnCuO2 and PbCuO2 having the inversion symmetry breaking $P4mm$
polar space group are predicted to be such materials. The active inner s
electrons in Sn and Pb hybridize with O $2p$ states leading the buckling in
copper-oxygen layers and thus induces ferroelectricity, which is known as the
lone pair mechanism. As a result of the $d^9$ configuration, SnCuO2 and PbCuO2
are charge transfer insulators with the antiferromagnetic ground state of the
moment on Cu retaining some strongly correlated physical properties of parent
compounds of copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. Our work reveals
the possibility of designing multiferroics based on copper oxide
high-temperature superconductors.

<br>
<br>
The discovery of a square magnetic-skyrmion lattice in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, with
the smallest so far found skyrmion diameter and without a geometrically
frustrated lattice, has attracted significant attention, particularly for
potential applications in memory devices and quantum computing. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study of surface and bulk electronic structures of
GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ by utilizing momentum-resolved photoemission (ARPES)
measurements and first-principles calculations. We show how the electronic
structure evolves during the antiferromagnetic transition when a peculiar
helical order of 4$f$ magnetic moments within the Gd layers sets in. A nice
agreement of the ARPES-derived electronic structure with the calculated one has
allowed us to characterize the features of the Fermi surface (FS), unveil the
nested region along the $k_z$ at the corner of the 3D FS, and reveal their
orbital compositions. Our findings suggest that the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction plays a decisive role in stabilizing
the spiral-like order of Gd 4$f$ moments responsible for the skyrmion physics
in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our results provide a deeper understanding of electronic and
magnetic properties of this material, which is crucial for predicting and
developing novel skyrmion-based devices.

<h3>Zero-Point Quantum Diffusion of Proton in Hydrogen-rich Superconductor  $LaH_{10}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
$LaH_{10}$, as a member of hydrogen-rich superconductors, has a
superconducting critical temperature of 250 K at high pressures, which exhibits
the possibility of solving the long-term goal of room temperature
superconductivity. Considering the extreme pressure and low mass of hydrogen,
the nuclear quantum effects in $LaH_{10}$ should be significant and have an
impact on its various physical properties. Here, we adopt the method combines
deep-potential (DP) and quantum thermal bath (QTB), which was verified to be
able to account for quantum effects in high-accuracy large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations. Our method can actually reproduce pressure-temperature
phase diagrams of $LaH_{10}$ consistent with experimental and theoretical
results. After incorporating quantum effects, the quantum fluctuation driven
diffusion of proton is found even in the absence of thermal fluctuation near 0
K. The high mobility of proton is found to be compared to liquid, yet the
structure of $LaH_{10}$ is still rigid. These results would greatly enrich our
vision to study quantum behavior of hydrogen-rich superconductors.

We demonstrate that an image recognition algorithm based on a convolutional
neural network provides a powerful procedure to differentiate between ergodic,
non-ergodic extended (fractal) and localized phases in various systems:
single-particle models, including random-matrix and random-graph models, and
many-body quantum systems. The network can be successfully trained on a small
data set of only 500 wave functions (images) per class for a single model. The
trained network can then be used to classify phases in the other models and is
thus very efficient. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the approach.

<h3>Axis-symmetric Onsager Clustered States of Point Vortices in a Bounded  Domain</h3>

<br>
<i>Yanqi Xiong, Jiawen Chen, Xiaoquan Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study axis-symmetric Onsager clustered states of a neutral point vortex
system confined to a two-dimensional disc. Our analysis is based on the mean
field of bounded point vortices in the microcanonical ensemble. The clustered
vortex states are specified by the inverse temperature $\beta$ and the rotation
frequency $\omega$, which are the conjugate variables of energy $E$ and angular
momentum $L$. The formation of the axis-symmetric clustered vortex states
(azimuthal angle independent) involves the separating of vortices with opposite
circulation and the clustering of vortices with same circulation around origin
and edge. The state preserves $\rm SO(2)$ symmetry and breaks $\mathbb Z_2$
symmetry. We find that, near the uniform state, the rotation free state
($\omega=0$) emerges at particular values of $L^2/E$ and $\beta$. At large
energies, we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions, whose
validity condition gives rise the lower bound of $\beta$ for the rotation free
states. Noticeably, the obtained vortex density distribution near the edge at
large energies provides a novel exact vortex density distribution for the
corresponding chiral vortex system.

<i>Anne Bernand-Mantel, Sarah Barnova, Anaïs Fondet, Cyrill B. Muratov, Theresa M. Simon</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a micromagnetic theory of compact magnetic skyrmions under applied
magnetic field that accounts for the full dipolar energy and the interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moryia interaction (DMI) in the thin film regime. Asymptotic
analysis is used to derive analytical formulas for the parametric dependence of
the skyrmion size and rotation angle, as well as the energy barriers for
collapse and bursting, two processes that lead to a finite skyrmion lifetime.
We demonstrate the existence of a new regime at low DMI, in which the skyrmion
is stabilized by a combination of non-local dipolar interaction and a magnetic
field applied parallel to its core, and discuss the conditions for an
experimental realization of such field-stabilized skyrmions.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate single-shot all-optical switching (AOS) in
Tb/Co/Gd/Co/Tb multilayers in an attempt to establish AOS in synthetic
ferrimagnets with high magnetic anisotropy. In particular, we study the effect
of varying Tb thicknesses to disentangle the role of the two rare earth
elements. Even though the role of magnetic compensation has been considered to
be crucial, we find that the threshold fluence for switching is largely
independent of the Tb content. Moreover, we identify the timescale for the
magnetization to cross zero to be within the first ps after laser excitation
using time-resolved MOKE. We conclude that the switching is governed mostly by
interactions between Co and Gd.

<h3>Straintronics using the monolayer-Xene platform -- a comparative study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Monolayer silicene is a front runner in the 2D-Xene family, which also
comprises germanene, stanene, and phosphorene, to name a few, due to its
compatibility with current silicon fabrication technology. Here, we investigate
the utility of 2D-Xenes for straintronics using the ab-initio density
functional theory coupled with quantum transport based on the Landauer
formalism. With a rigorous band structure analysis, we show the effect of
strain on the K-point, and calculate the directional piezoresistances for the
buckled Xenes as per their critical strain limit. Further, we compare the
relevant gauge factors, and their sinusoidal dependences on the transport angle
akin to silicene and graphene. The strain-insensitive transport angles
corresponding to the zero gauge factors are 81 degree and 34 degree for
armchair and zigzag strains, respectively, for silicene and germanene. For
stanene as the strain limit is extended to 10% and notable changes in the
fundamental parameters, the critical angle for stanene along armchair and
zigzag directions are 69 degree and 34 degree respectively. The small values of
gauge factors are attributed to their stable Dirac cones and strain-independent
valley degeneracies. We also explore conductance modulation, which is quantized
in nature and exhibits a similar pattern with other transport parameters
against a change in strain. Based on the obtained results, we propose the
buckled Xenes as an interconnect in flexible electronics and are promising
candidates for various applications in straintronics.

Two-dimensional magnets have manifested themselves as promising candidates
for quantum devices. We here report that the edge and strain effects during the
device fabrication with two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets such as CrX$_3$
(X=Cl, I, Br) and CrXTe$_3$ (X=Si, Ge) can be characterized by a
(1+1)-dimensional magnon chiral anomaly beyond the fermionic paradigm. In the
presence of zigzag edges, a pair of chiral bulk-edge magnon bands appear and
cause an imbalance of left- and right-chirality magnons when subjected to
nonuniform temperature or magnetic fields. In the presence of a uniaxial
strain, the bulk Dirac magnons are broken into chiral magnon pseudo-Landau
levels, resulting in a magnon chiral anomaly observable through a negative
strain-resistivity of the magnetic dipole and heat. Our work demonstrates a
chiral anomaly with (quasi)particles obeying non-fermionic statistics and will
be instructive in understanding anomalous magnon transport.

<br>
<br>
Using the Lindemann criterion, we analyzed the quantum and thermal melting of
electronic and excitonic crystals recently discovered in 2D semiconductor
moir\'e patterns. We show that the finite 2D screening of the atomically thin
material can suppress (enhance) the inter-site Coulomb (dipolar) interaction
strength, thus inhibits (facilitates) the formation of the electronic
(excitonic) crystal. Meanwhile, a strong enough moir\'e confinement is found to
be essential for realizing the crystal phase with a lattice constant near 10 nm
or shorter. From the calculated Lindemann ratio which quantifies the
fluctuation of the site displacement, we estimate that the crystal will melt
into a liquid above a temperature in the order of several tens Kelvin.

A semiclassical second-order differential equation for the inhomogeneous
local gap $\Delta(r)$ is derived from a strict second-order $\hbar$ expansion
of the anomalous pairing tensor and compared with a similar equation given by
Simonucci et al. The second-order normal density matrix is given as well.
Several extra gradient terms are revealed. Second-order expressions at finite
temperature are given for the first time. The corresponding Ginzburg-Landau
equation is presented and it is shown that, compared to the equation of Baranov

Recurrent neural network models are high-dimensional dynamical systems in
which the degrees of freedom are coupled through synaptic connections and
evolve according to a set of differential equations. When the synaptic
connections are sufficiently strong and random, such models display a chaotic
phase which can be used to perform a task if the network is carefully trained.
It is fair to say that this setting applies to many other complex systems, from
biological organisms (from cells, to individuals and populations) to financial
markets. For all these out-of-equilibrium systems, elementary units live in a
chaotic environment and need to adapt their strategies to survive by extracting
information from the environment and controlling the feedback loop on it. In
this work we consider a prototypical high-dimensional chaotic system as a
simplified model for a recurrent neural network and more complex learning
systems. We study the model under two particular training strategies: Hebbian
training and FORCE training. In the first case we show that Hebbian training
can be used to tune the level of chaos in the dynamics and this reproduces some
results recently obtained in the study of standard models of RNN. In the latter
case, we show that the dynamical system can be trained to reproduce a simple
periodic function. We show that the FORCE algorithm drives the dynamics close
to an asymptotic attractor the larger the training time. We also discuss
possible extensions of our setup to other learning strategies.

<h3>Unraveling the interlayer and intralayer coupling in two-dimensional  layered MoS$_2$ by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ab initio molecular  dynamics simulations</h3>

<br>
Understanding interlayer and intralayer coupling in two-dimensional layered
materials (2DLMs) has fundamental and technological importance for their
large-scale production, engineering heterostructures, and development of
flexible and transparent electronics. At the same time, the quantification of
weak interlayer interactions in 2DMLs is a challenging task, especially, from
the experimental point of view. Herein, we demonstrate that the use of X-ray
absorption spectroscopy in combination with reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) and ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations can provide useful information on
both interlayer and intralayer coupling in 2DLM 2H$_c$-MoS$_2$. The analysis of
the low-temperature (10-300 K) Mo K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS) using RMC simulations allows for obtaining information on the
means-squared relative displacements $\sigma^2$ for nearest and distant Mo-S
and Mo-Mo atom pairs. This information allowed us further to determine the
strength of the interlayer and intralayer interactions in terms of the
characteristic Einstein frequencies $\omega_E$ and the effective force
constants $\kappa$ for the nearest ten coordination shells around molybdenum.
The studied temperature range was extended up to 1200 K employing AIMD
simulations which were validated at 300 K using the EXAFS data. Both RMC and
AIMD results provide evidence of the reduction of correlation in thermal motion
between distant atoms and suggest strong anisotropy of atom thermal vibrations
within the plane of the layers and in the orthogonal direction.

In low-temperature resonant Raman experiments on MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$
heterobilayers, we identify a hybrid interlayer shear mode (HSM) with an
energy, close to the interlayer shear mode (SM) of the heterobilayers, but with
a much broader, asymmetric lineshape. The HSM shows a pronounced resonance with
the intralayer hybrid trions (HX$^-$) of the MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ layers, only.
No resonance with the neutral intralayer excitons is found. First-principles
calculations reveal a strong coupling of Q-valley states, which are delocalized
over both layers and participate in the HX$^-$, with the SM. This emerging
trion-phonon coupling may be relevant for experiments on gate-controlled
heterobilayers.

We perform supercurrent and tunneling spectroscopy measurements on
gate-tunable InAs/Al Josephson junctions (JJs) in an in-plane magnetic field,
and report on phase shifts in the current-phase relation measured with respect
to an absolute phase reference. The impact of orbital effects is investigated
by studying multiple devices with different superconducting lead sizes.At low
fields, we observe gate-dependent phase shifts of up to ${\varphi_{0}=0.5\pi}$
which are consistent with a Zeeman field coupling to highly-transmissive
Andreev bound states via Rashba spin-orbit interaction. A distinct phase shift
emerges at larger fields, concomitant with a switching current minimum and the
closing and reopening of the superconducting gap. These signatures of an
induced phase transition, which might resemble a topological transition, scale
with the superconducting lead size, demonstrating the crucial role of orbital
effects. Our results elucidate the interplay of Zeeman, spin-orbit and orbital
effects in InAs/Al JJs, giving new understanding to phase transitions in hybrid
JJs and their applications in quantum computing and superconducting
electronics.

<br>
<br>
We study a system composed of two quantum dots connected in series between
two leads at different temperatures, in the limit of large intratomic
repulsion. Using the non-crossing approximation, we calculate the spectral
densities at both dots $\rho_i(\omega)$, the thermal and thermoelectric
responses, thermopower and figure of merit in different regimes. The
interatomic repulsionleads to finite heat transport even if the hopping between
the dots $t=0$. The thermopower can be very large compared to single-dot
systems in several regimes. The changes in sign of the thermoelectric current
can be understood from the position and magnitude of the Kondo and
charge-transfer peaks in $\rho_i(\omega)$. The figure of merit can reach values
near 0.7. The violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law is much more significant
than in previously studied nanoscopic systems. An analysis of the widths of
$\rho_i(\omega)$ indicates that the dots are at effective temperatures $T_i$
intermediate between those of the two leads, which tend to be the same for
large $T$.

<h3>Existence of two distinct valence bond solid states in the dimerized  frustrated ferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_1'$-$J_2$ chain</h3>

<i>Jędrzej Wardyn, Satoshi Nishimoto, Cliò Efthimia Agrapidis</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the frustrated and dimerized ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic
$J_1$-$J_1'$-$J_2$ chain using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
method. Based on numerical calculations of the second derivative of energy,
spin gap, spin-spin correlations, string order parameter (SOP), and
entanglement spectrum (ES), we obtain the ground-state phase diagram for a wide
range of $J_1'/J_1$ and $J_2/|J_1|$ values. This phase diagram reveals a
ferromagnetic phase and two distinct valence-bond-solid (VBS) phases. The first
VBS phase, referred to as $\mathcal{D}_3$-VBS, is typified by the formation of
valence bonds between third-neighbor spin-1/2's, persisting as a continuation
from the $J_1'/J_1=1$ limit. Alternatively, the second VBS phase, referred to
as mixed-VBS, exhibits a coexistence of both second- and third-neighbor valence
bonds, interpreted as a continuation from the $J_1'/J_1=0$ case. Remarkably,
both VBS states are identified as being of Haldane-type, marked by a finite SOP
and 2-fold ES degeneracy. Unexpectedly, our analysis uncovers a significant
enhancement of the valence bond stability at the boundary of the two VBS
phases. This study provides the first empirical demonstration of a nontrivial
quantum phase transition between different topological VBS states in spin-1/2
chains. Moreover, we find that the ground state of the relevant
quasi-one-dimensional material LiCuSbO$_4$ is classified as the
$\mathcal{D}_3$-VBS state. Collectively, these results mark a substantial
stride forward in our comprehension of quantum phase transitions and
topological states.

<br>
<br>
Granular materials often segregate under mechanical agitation, in contrast to
the expectation of mixing. It is well known that a bidisperse mixture of
granular materials in a partially filled rotating cylinder exhibits alternating
bands depending on the combination of the two species. The dynamic angle of
repose, which is the angle that a steady avalanche makes with the horizontal,
has been considered to be the dominant parameter that determines the segregated
state. However, several experimental cases were conducted where the previously
known angle of repose condition was not always satisfied. We conducted an
exhaustive parameter search to clarify the conditions with three dimensionless
parameters: the particle size difference normalized by the average particle
size, the specific density ratio, and the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the
average particle size. Additional experiments were conducted to explore the
effect of rotational speed of a cylinder. This systematic approach enables us
to predict what kind of segregated state will occur. Moreover, we discovered
that the band width can be effectively scaled by the combination of these three
parameters.

In this review, we discuss the use of continuous variable spectroscopy
techniques for investigating quantum coherence and light-matter interactions in
semiconductor systems with ultrafast dynamics. We focus on multichannel
homodyne detection as a powerful tool to measure the quantum coherence and the
full density matrix of a polariton system. By monitoring the temporal decay of
quantum coherence in the polariton condensate, we observe coherence times
exceeding the nanosecond scale. Our findings, supported by proof-of-concept
experiments and numerical simulations, demonstrate the enhanced resourcefulness
of the produced system states for modern quantum protocols. The combination of
tailored resource quantifiers and ultrafast spectroscopy techniques presented

In this paper, we derive corrections to the subleading logarithmic term of

scaling formula leads to much better estimations of the number of Goldstone
modes in the two-dimensional square lattice spin-1/2 Heisenberg model and
bilayer spin-1/2 Heisenberg model in systems of rather small sizes, compared
with previous results. In addition, the universal geometry-dependent finite
constant in the entanglement entropy scaling is also obtained in good agreement
with the theoretical value.

We realize a superconducting nanodevice in which vortex traps in the form of
an aluminum square are integrated with a Dayem nanobridge. We perform
field-cooling of the traps arriving to different vortex configurations,
dependent on the applied magnetic field, to demonstrate that the switching
current of the bridge is highly sensitive to the presence and location of
vortices in the trap. Our measurements exhibit unprecedented precision and
ability to detect the first and successive vortex entries into all fabricated
traps, from few hundred nm to 2 $\mu$m in size. The experimental results are
corroborated by Ginzburg-Landau simulations, which reveal the subtle yet
crucial changes in the density of the superconducting condensate in the
vicinity of the bridge with every additional vortex entry and relocation inside
the trap. An ease of integration and simplicity make our design a convenient
platform for studying dynamics of vortices in strongly confining geometries,
involving a promise to manipulate vortex states electronically with
simultaneous in situ control and monitoring.

Complex spin-spin interactions in magnets can often lead to magnetic
superlattices with complex local magnetic arrangements, and many of the
magnetic superlattices have been found to possess non-trivial topological
electronic properties. Due to the huge size and complex magnetic moment
arrangement of the magnetic superlattices, it is a great challenge to perform a
direct DFT calculation on them. In this work, an equivariant deep learning
framework is designed to accelerate the electronic calculation of magnetic
systems by exploiting both the equivariant constraints of the magnetic
Hamiltonian matrix and the physical rules of spin-spin interactions. This
framework can bypass the costly self-consistent iterations and build a direct
mapping from a magnetic configuration to the ab initio Hamiltonian matrix.
After training on the magnets with random magnetic configurations, our model
achieved high accuracy on the test structures outside the training set, such as
spin spiral and non-collinear antiferromagnetic configurations. The trained
model is also used to predict the energy bands of a skyrmion configuration of
NiBrI containing thousands of atoms, showing the high efficiency of our model
on large magnetic superlattices.

<h3>Glass transition temperature of thin polymer films</h3>

<br>

The glass transition temperature and its connection to statistical properties
of confined and free-standing polymer films of varying thickness containing
unentangled to highly entangled bead-spring chains are studied by molecular
dynamics simulations. For confined films, perfect scaling of the
thickness-dependent end-to-end distance and radius of gyrations normalized to
their bulk values in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the surfaces
is obtained. Particularly, the reduced end-to-end distance in the perpendicular
direction is very well described by the extended Silberberg model. For bulk
polymer melts, the relation between chain length and $T_g$ follows the
Fox-Flory equation while $T_g$ for a given film thickness is almost independent
of chain length. For films, $T_g$ decreases and is well described by Keddie's
formula, where the reduction is more pronounced for free-standing films. For
the present model, $T_g$ begins to deviate from bulk $T_g$ at the
characteristic film thickness, where the average bond orientation becomes
anisotropic and the entanglement density decreases.

Understanding carrier trapping in solids has proven key to semiconductor
technologies but observations thus far have relied on ensembles of point
defects, where the impact of neighboring traps or carrier screening is often
important. Here, we investigate the capture of photo-generated holes by an
individual negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at room
temperature. Using an externally gated potential to minimize space-charge
effects, we find the capture probability under electric fields of variable sign
and amplitude shows an asymmetric-bell-shaped response with maximum at zero
voltage. To interpret these observations, we run semi-classical Monte Carlo
simulations modeling carrier trapping through a cascade process of phonon
emission, and obtain electric-field-dependent capture probabilities in good
agreement with experiment. Since the mechanisms at play are insensitive to the
trap characteristics, the capture cross sections we observe - largely exceeding
those derived from ensemble measurements - should also be present in materials
platforms other than diamond.

Physical networks are made of nodes and links that are physical objects
embedded in a geometric space. Understanding how the mutual volume exclusion
between these elements affects the structure and function of physical networks
calls for a suitable generalization of network theory. Here, we introduce a
network-of-networks framework where we describe the shape of each extended
physical node as a network embedded in space and these networks are bound
together by physical links. Relying on this representation, we model the growth
of physical networks, showing for a general class of systems that volume
exclusion induces heterogeneity in both node volume and degree, with the two
becoming correlated. These emergent structural properties strongly affect the
dynamics on physical networks: by calculating their Laplacian spectrum as a
function of the coupling strength between the nodes we show that volume-degree
correlations suppress the tail of the spectrum. Finally, we apply our
theoretical framework to a large-scale three-dimensional map of a fruit fly
brain, finding analog behavior with the networks generated by our growth model.

<h3>Particle dynamics and ergodicity-breaking in twisted-bilayer optical  lattices</h3>

Recent experiments have realized a twisted bilayer-like optical potential for
ultra-cold atoms, which in contrast to solid-state set ups may allow for an
arbitrary ratio between the inter- and intra-layer couplings. For commensurate
Moir\'e twistings a large-enough inter-layer coupling results in particle
transport dominated by channel formation. For incommensurate twistings, the
interlayer coupling acts as an effective disorder strength. Whereas for weak
couplings the whole spectrum remains ergodic, at a critical value part of the
eigenspectrum transitions into multifractal states. A similar transition may be
observed as well as a function of an energy bias between the two layers. Our
study reveals atoms in optical twisted-bilayer lattices as an interesting new
platform for the study of ergodicity breaking and multifractality.

We study the aerodynamics of a flapping flexible wing with a two-vein pattern
that mimics the elastic response of insect wings in a simplified manner. The
experiments reveal a non-monotonic variation of the thrust force produced by
the wings when the angle between the two veins is varied. An optimal
configuration is consistently reached when the two veins are spaced at an angle
of about 20 degrees. This value is in the range of what has been measured in
the literature for several insect species. The deformation of the wings is
monitored during the experiment using video recordings, which allows to
pinpoint the physical mechanism behind the non-monotonic behaviour of the force
curve and the optimal distribution of the vein network in terms of propulsive
force.

The exploration of atomic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states is now within
reach in optical-lattice experiments. While bulk signatures have been observed
in a system realizing the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model in a box [Leonard et
al., arXiv:2210.10919], how to access hallmark edge properties in this setting
remains a central open question. We propose and analyze a realistic scheme to
extract the momentum-resolved edge spectrum of atomic FQH states. Our proposal
is based on subjecting the prepared FQH ground state to two interfering
Laguerre-Gaussian beams, which transfer a controlled angular momentum $l$ and
energy $\hbar \omega$ to the system. The resonant coupling is then detected
through local density measurements, by tracking the transfer of atoms from the
bulk to the edge of the FQH droplet. We benchmark our method using numerical
simulations of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, considering few bosons in the
$\nu=1/2$ Laughlin ground state. These studies demonstrate that our probing
scheme is well suited to extract hallmark features of FQH spectra: a chiral
gapless edge branch and a gapped magneto-roton mode. These signatures are
already detectable in realistic systems of two bosons, provided that the box
potential is larger than the droplet. Our work paves the way for the detection
of fractional statistics in cold atoms through edge signatures.

Quantum numbers identify and differentiate between quantum states of a
quantum system. The azimuthal or orbital angular momentum quantum numbers
characterize wave functions that are invariant under discrete rotations. For a
chiral system with screw symmetry, the rotational invariance is broken and the
Bloch orbital angular momentum is generally not acknowledged. Here, we show
that the wave functions of Bloch electrons in such a chiral system, denoted as
helical electrons, are helical or vortex waves and, therefore, have
well-defined orbital angular momentum along the screw axis. The collinear
orbital-momentum locking imposed by the screw-induced orbital helicity leads to
the orbital-selective transport as illustrated by tight-binding model
calculations. We verify the helical states and orbital selectivity for two real
chiral materials, namely, peptide helix and trigonal Se, by first-principles
band structure calculations. Finally, we show that the interconversion between
the orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum at the chiral-achiral
interfaces together with the orbital selectivity of the propagating helical
electrons provide a fundamental principle for the chiral induced spin
selectivity. Our understandings of the screw symmetry induced orbital angular
momentum in chiral materials and the interplay between orbital angular momentum
and spin angular momentum at the chiral-achiral interface paves a way for
designing orbitronics and spintronics with chiral materials.

Hybrid organic inorganic formate perovskites, AB(HCOO)$_3$, is a large family
of compounds which exhibit variety of phase transitions and diverse properties.
Some examples include (anti)ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity,
(anti)ferromagnetism, and multiferroism. While many properties of these
materials have already been characterized, we are not aware of any study that
focuses on comprehensive property assessment of a large number of formate
perovskites. Comparison of the materials property within the family is
challenging due to systematic errors attributed to different techniques or the
lack of data. For example, complete piezoelectric, dielectric and elastic
tensors are not available. In this work, we utilize first-principles density
functional theory based simulations to overcome these challenges and to report
structural, mechanical, dielectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties
for 29 formate perovskites. We find that these materials exhibit elastic
stiffness in the range 0.5 to 127.0 GPa , highly anisotropic linear
compressibility, including zero and even negative values; dielectric constants
in the range 0.1 to 102.1; highly anisotropic piezoelectric response with the
longitudinal values in the range 1.18 to 21.12 pC/N, and spontaneous
polarizations in the range 0.2 to 7.8 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Furthermore, we propose
and computationally characterize a few formate perovskites, which have not been
reported yet.

Through micromagnetic simulations, this work analyzes the stability of Bloch
points in magnetic nanospheres and the possibility of using an array of such
particles to compose a system with the features of a magnetic trap. We show
that a BP can be nucleated as a metastable configuration in a relatively wide
range of the nanosphere radius compared to a quasi-uniform and vortex state. We
also show that the stabilized Bloch point generates a quadrupolar magnetic
field outside it, from which we analyze the field profile of different arrays
of these nanospheres to show that the obtained magnetic field shares the
features of magnetic traps. Some of the highlights of the proposed magnetic
traps rely on the magnetic field gradients achieved, which are orders of
magnitude higher than standard magnetic traps, and allow three-dimensional
trapping. Our results could be useful in trapping particles through the
intrinsic magnetization of ferromagnetic nanoparticles while avoiding the
commonly used mechanisms associated with Joule heating.

FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ remains one of the most enigmatic systems of Fe-based
superconductors. While much is known about the orthorhombic parent compound,
FeSe, the tetragonal samples, FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ with x>0.17, remain relatively
unexplored. Here, we provide an in-depth investigation of the electronic states
of tetragonal FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$, using scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements, supported by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and theoretical modeling. We demonstrate that by analyzing
modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) near and away from Fe vacancy
defects separately, we can identify quasiparticle interference (QPI) signals
originating from multiple regions of the Brillouin zone, including the bands at
the M and A points. We also observe that QPI signals coexist with a much
stronger LDOS modulation for states near the Fermi level whose period is
independent of energy. Our measurements further reveal that this strong pattern
appears in the STS measurements as short range stripe patterns that are locally
two-fold symmetric. Since these stripe patterns coexist with four-fold
symmetric QPI around Fe-vacancies, the origin of their local two-fold symmetry
must be distinct from that of nematic states in orthorhombic samples. To
further understand these stripe patterns, we explore several aspects related to
them, such as the role of S and Fe vacancy defects, and whether they can be
explained by QPI. We consider the possibility that the observed stripe patterns
may represent incipient charge order correlations, similar to those observed in
the cuprates.

<h3>Interplay of magnetic field and magnetic impurities in Ising  superconductors</h3>

Phonon-driven $s$-wave superconductivity is fundamentally antagonistic to
uniform magnetism, and field-induced suppression of the critical temperature is
one of its canonical signatures. Examples of the opposite are unique and
require fortuitous cancellations and very fine parameter tuning. The recently
discovered Ising superconductors violate this rule: an external magnetic field
applied in a certain direction does not suppress superconductivity in an ideal,
impurity-free material. We propose a simple and experimentally accessible
system where the effects of spin-conserving and spin-flip scattering can be
studied in a controlled way, namely NbSe$_2$ monolayers dozed with magnetic
$3d$ atoms. We predict that the critical temperature is slightly increased by
an in-plane magnetic field in NbSe$_2$ dozed with Cr. Due to the band spin
splitting, magnetic spin-flip scattering requires a finite momentum transfer,
while spin-conserving scattering does not. If the magnetic anisotropy is
easy-axis, an in-plane field reorients the impurity spins and transforms
spin-conserving scattering into spin-flip. The critical temperature is enhanced
if the induced magnetization of NbSe$_2$ has a substantial long-range
component, as is the case for Cr ions.

<h3>Statistical field theory for nonlinear elasticity of polymer networks  with excluded volume interactions</h3>

Polymer networks formed by cross linking flexible polymer chains are
ubiquitous in many natural and synthetic soft-matter systems. Current
micromechanics models generally do not account for excluded volume interactions
except, for instance, through imposing a phenomenological incompressibility
constraint at the continuum scale. This work aims to examine the role of
excluded volume interactions on the mechanical response. The approach is based
on the framework of the self-consistent statistical field theory of polymers,
which provides an efficient mesoscale approach that enables the accounting of
excluded volume effects without the expense of large-scale molecular modeling.
A mesoscale representative volume element is populated with multiple
interacting chains, and the macroscale nonlinear elastic deformation is imposed
by mapping the end-to-end vectors of the chains by this deformation. In the
absence of excluded volume interactions, it recovers the closed-form results of
the classical theory of rubber elasticity. With excluded volume interactions,
the model is solved numerically in three dimensions using a finite element
method to obtain the energy, stresses, and linearized moduli under imposed
macroscale deformation. Highlights of the numerical study include: (i) the
linearized Poisson's ratio is very close to the incompressible limit without a
phenomenological imposition of incompressibility; (ii) despite the harmonic
Gaussian chain as a starting point, there is an emergent strain-softening and
strain-stiffening response that is characteristic of real polymer networks,
driven by the interplay between the entropy and the excluded volume
interactions; and (iii) the emergence of a deformation-sensitive localization
instability at large excluded volumes.

<h3>Network plasticity: reduced-order modeling of deformation-driven  microstructure evolution</h3>

Microstructural evolution in structural materials is known to occur in
response to mechanical loading and can often accommodate substantial plastic
deformation through the coupled motion of grain boundaries (GBs). This can
produce desirable behavior, such as increased ductility, or undesirable
behavior such as mechanically-induced coarsening. In this work a novel,
multiscale model is developed for capturing the combined effect of plasticity
mediated by multiple GBs simultaneously. This model is referred to as "network
plasticity" (NP). The mathematical framework of graph theory is used to
describe the microstructure connectedness, and the evolution of microstructure
is represented as volume flow along the graph. By using the principle of
minimum dissipation potential, which has previously been applied to grain
boundary migration, a set of evolution equations are developed that transfer
volume and eigendeformation along the graph edges in a physically consistent
way. It is shown that higher-order geometric effects, such as the pinning
effect of triple points, may be accounted for through the incorporation of a
geometric hardening that causes geometry-induced GB stagnation. The result is a
computationally efficient reduced order model that can be used to simulate the
initial motion of grain boundaries in a polycrystal with parameters informed by
atomistic simulations. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through
comparison to multiple bicrystal atomistic simulations, as well as a select
number of GB engineered and non-GB engineered data obtained from the
literature. The network plastic effect is demonstrated through mechanical
response tests and by examining the yield surfaces, and the transition from NP
to other, simpler plasticity models is explored.

The pursuit of exotic phases of matter outside of the extreme conditions of a
quantizing magnetic field has been a long standing quest of solid state
physics. Recent experiments have observed spontaneous valley polarization and
fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in zero magnetic field in twisted bilayers
of MoTe$_2$, at partial filling of the topological valence band ($\nu=-2/3$ and
$-3/5$). We study the topological valence band at $\textit{half}$ filling,
using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group
calculations. We discover a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) phase even at zero
magnetic field that covers a large portion of the phase diagram centered around
twist angle ${\sim}3.6^\circ$. The CFL is a non-Fermi liquid phase that shows
metallic behavior despite the absence of Landau quasiparticles. We discuss
experimental implications including the competition between the CFL and a Fermi
liquid, which can be tuned with a displacement field. The topological valence
band has excellent quantum geometry over a wide range of twist angles and a
small bandwidth that is, remarkably, reduced by interactions for a range of
angles. These key properties are responsible for stabilizing the exotic quantum
Hall phases we find at zero field. Finally, we present an optical signature
involving ``extinguished" optical responses as a means to identify Chern bands
with ideal quantum geometry.

Low-dimensional quantum systems can host anyons, particles with exchange
statistics that are neither bosonic nor fermionic. Despite indications of a
wealth of exotic phenomena, the physics of anyons in one dimension (1D) remains
largely unexplored. Here, we realize Abelian anyons in 1D with arbitrary
exchange statistics using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, where we
engineer the statistical phase via a density-dependent Peierls phase. We
explore the dynamical behavior of two anyons undergoing quantum walks, and
observe the anyonic Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, as well as the formation of
bound states without on-site interactions. Once interactions are introduced, we
observe spatially asymmetric transport in contrast to the symmetric dynamics of
bosons and fermions. Our work forms the foundation for exploring the many-body
behavior of 1D anyons.
