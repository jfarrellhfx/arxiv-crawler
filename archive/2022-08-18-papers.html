<h3>Microscopic Activated Dynamics Theory of the Shear Rheology and Stress Overshoot in Ultra-Dense Glass-Forming Fluids and Colloidal Suspensions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08419v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08419v1</a>

<i>Ashesh Ghosh, Kenneth S. Schweizer</i>
<br>
<br>
We formulate a microscopic, force-level, activated dynamics-based
statistical-mechanical theory for the continuous startup nonlinear
shear-rheology of ultra-dense glass-forming hard-sphere fluids and colloidal
suspensions in the context of the ECNLE approach. Activated structural
relaxation is described as a coupled local-nonlocal event involving caging and
longer-range collective elasticity which controls the characteristic stress
relaxation time. Theoretical predictions for the deformation-induced mobility
enhancement, onset of relaxation acceleration at low values of stress, strain,
or shear-rate, apparent power-law thinning of the steady-state structural
relaxation time and viscosity, a non-vanishing activation barrier in the
shear-thinning regime, an apparent Herschel-Bulkley form of the rate dependence
of the steady-state shear stress, exponential growth of different measures of a
dynamic yield or flow-stress with packing fraction, and reduced fragility and
dynamic heterogeneity under deformation were previously shown to be in good
agreement with experiment. The central new question addressed here is the
defining feature of the transient response - the stress-overshoot. In contrast
to the steady-state flow regime, understanding the transient response requires
an explicit treatment of the coupled nonequilibrium evolution of structure,
elastic modulus, and stress relaxation time. We formulate a new quantitative
model for this aspect in a physically motivated and computationally tractable
manner. Theoretical predictions for the stress-overshoot are shown to be in
good agreement with experimental observations in the metastable ultra-dense
regime of hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as a function of shear-rate and
packing fraction, and accounting for deformation-assisted activated motion is
crucial for both the transient and steady-state responses.

<h3>Finite temperature dynamics in gapped 1D models in the sine-Gordon family</h3>

The sine-Gordon model appears as the low-energy effective field theory of
various one-dimensional gapped quantum systems. Here we investigate the
dynamics of generic, non-integrable systems belonging to the sine-Gordon family
at finite temperature within the semiclassical approach. Focusing on time
scales where the effect of nontrivial quasiparticle scatterings becomes
relevant, we obtain universal results for the long-time behavior of dynamical
correlation functions. We find that correlation functions of vertex operators
behave neither ballistically nor diffusively but follow a stretched exponential
decay in time. We also study the full counting statistics of the topological
current and find that distribution of the transferred charge is non-Gaussian
with its cumulants scaling non-uniformly in time.

<h3>Cyclotron- and magnetoplasmon resonances in bilayer graphene ratchets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on a tunable - by magnetic field and gate voltage - conversion of
terahertz radiation into a dc current in spatially modulated bilayer graphene.
We experimentally demonstrate that the underlying physics is related to the
so-called ratchet effect. Our key findings are the direct observation of a
sharp cyclotron resonance in the photocurrent and the demonstration of two
effects caused by electron-electron interaction: the plasmonic splitting of the
resonance due to long-range Coulomb coupling and the partial suppression of its
second harmonic due to fast interparticle collisions. We develop a theory which
perfectly fits our data. We argue that the ratchet current is generated in the
hydrodynamic regime of non-ideal electron liquid.

<h3>Phase dynamics in an AC driven multiterminal Josephson junction analogue</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08428v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08428v1</a>
<br>
<i>Franois Amet, Sara Idris, Aeron McConnell, Brian Opatosky, Ethan Arnault</i>
<br>
<br>
In the presence of an AC drive, multiterminal Josephson junctions exhibit the
inverse AC Josephson effect, where the oscillations of the superconducting
phase of each junction can lock onto one another or onto the external drive.
The competition between these different phase locked states results in a
complex array of quantized voltage plateaus whose stability strongly depend on
the circuit parameters of the shunted junctions. This phase diagram cannot be
explored with low temperature transport experiments alone, given the breadth of
the parameter space, so we present an easily tunable analog circuit whose
dynamical properties emulate those of a three terminal junction. We focus on
the observation of the multiterminal inverse AC Josephson effect, and we
discuss how to identify Shapiro steps associated with each of the three
junctions as well as their quartet states. We only observe integer phase locked
states in strongly overdamped networks, but fractional Shapiro steps appear as
well when the quality factor of the junctions increases. Finally, we discuss
the role of transverse coupling in the synchronization of the junctions.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08427v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08427v1</a>
<br>
<i>Abhiram Soori</i>
<br>
<br>
We study Kitaev superconducting chain in which the chemical potential is
periodically driven and a junction between two such Kitaev chains. Floquet
states govern the dynamics of such systems. Starting from the ground state of
the undriven system, we gradually switch on the periodic driving over a
timescale $\tau$ and characterize the extent to which the single particle
eigenstates of the undriven system get distributed among the Floquet states by
calculating the inverse participation ratio. We find that when two
superconductors not differing in phase of the pair potentials are driven by
periodic potentials with different phases of the driving potentials, a net
average current flows from one superconductor to the other. We term such a
current anomalous current. Further, we study current phase relation in
junctions between two periodically driven superconductors and find that the
system exhibits nonequilibrium Josephson diode effect. We find that the current
between two Floquet superconductors in absence of superconducting phase bias is
maximum for difference in phases of driving $\phi=\pi/2$ and is large in the
adiabatic limit ($\tau \gg T$, where $T$ is the period of driving potential)
compared to sudden switching. We find that the magnitude of diode effect
coefficient is maximum for $\phi=\pi/2$ and is lower in the adiabatic limit
($\tau\gg T$) compared to the case when the periodic driving is suddenly
switched on. The Floquet Majorana end modes whenever present contribute
significantly to the anomalous current and the diode effect.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08424v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08424v1</a>
<br>
<i>Anjana M. Samarakoon, J. Strempfer, Junjie Zhang, Feng Ye, Yiming Qiu, J. -W. Kim, H. Zheng, S. Rosenkranz, M. R. Norman, J. F. Mitchell, D. Phelan</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum materials display rich and myriad types of magnetic, electronic, and
structural ordering, often with these ordering modes either competing with one
another or 'intertwining', that is, reinforcing one another. Low dimensional
quantum materials, influenced strongly by competing interactions and/or
geometric frustration, are particularly susceptible to such ordering phenomena
and thus offer fertile ground for understanding the consequent emergent
collective quantum phenomena. Such is the case of the quasi-2D materials
R4Ni3O10(R=La, Pr), in which intertwined charge-and spin-density waves (CDW and
SDW) on the Ni sublattice have been identified and characterized. Not
unexpectedly, these density waves are largely 2D as a result of weak coupling
between planes, compounded with magnetic frustration. In the case of R=Pr,
however, we show here that exchange coupling between the transition metal and
rare earth sublattices upon cooling overcomes both obstacles, leading to a
dimensional crossover into a fully 3D ordered and coupled SDW state on both
sublattices, as an induced moment on notionally nonmagnetic Pr3+ opens exchange
pathways in the third dimension. In the process, the structure of the SDW on
the Ni sublattice is irreversibly altered, an effect that survives reheating of
the material until the underlying CDW melts. This 'bootstrapping' mechanism
linking incommensurate SDWs on the two sublattices illustrates a new member of
the multitude of quantum states that low-dimensional magnets can express,
driven by coupled orders and modulated by frustrated exchange pathways.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08419v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08419v1</a>

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08283v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08283v1</a>
<br>
<i>Rohit Kumar Shukla, Sunil Kumar Mishra</i>
<br>
<br>
We study characteristic, dynamic, and saturation regimes of the
out-of-time-order correlation (OTOC) in the constant field Floquet system with
and without longitudinal field. In the calculation of OTOC, we take local spins
in longitudinal and transverse directions as observables which are local and
non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions, respectively. We use the exact
analytical solution of OTOC for the integrable model (without longitudinal
field term) with transverse direction spins as observables and numerical
solutions for other integrable and nonintegrable cases. OTOCs generated in both
cases depart from unity at a kick equal to the separation between the
observables when the local spins in the transverse direction and one additional
kick is required when the local spins in the longitudinal direction. The number
of kicks required to depart from unity depends on the separation between the
observables and is independent of the Floquet period and system size. In the
dynamic region, OTOCs show power-law growth in both models, the integrable
(without longitudinal field) as well as the nonintegrable (with longitudinal
field). The exponent of the power-law increases with increasing separation
between the observables. Near the saturation region, OTOCs grow linearly with a
very small rate.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08413v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08413v1</a>
<br>
<i>Timo Schorlepp, Tobias Grafke, Rainer Grauer</i>
<br>
<br>
Sharp large deviation estimates for stochastic differential equations with
small noise, based on minimizing the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional under
appropriate boundary conditions, can be obtained by integrating certain matrix
Riccati differential equations along the large deviation minimizers or
instantons, either forward or backward in time. Previous works in this
direction often rely on the existence of isolated minimizers with positive
definite second variation. By adopting techniques from field theory and
explicitly evaluating the large deviation prefactors as functional determinant
ratios using Forman's theorem, we extend the approach to general systems where
degenerate submanifolds of minimizers exist. The key technique for this is a
boundary-type regularization of the second variation operator. This extension
is particularly relevant if the system possesses continuous symmetries that are
broken by the instantons. We find that removing the vanishing eigenvalues
associated with the zero modes is possible within the Riccati formulation and
amounts to modifying the initial or final conditions and evaluation of the
Riccati matrices. We apply our results in multiple examples including a
dynamical phase transition for the average surface height in short-time large
deviations of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with flat
initial profile.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08395v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08395v1</a>
<br>
<i>Ilya Golokolenov, Arpit Ranadive, Luca Planat, Martina Esposito, Nicolas Roch, Xin Zhou, Andrew Fefferman, Eddy Collin</i>
<br>
<br>
In recent decades, the laws of thermodynamics have been pushed down to
smaller and smaller scales, within the field of stochastic thermodynamics and
state-of-art experiments performed on mesoscopic systems. But these
measurements concern mostly thermal properties of electrons and photons. Here
we report on the measurements of thermal fluctuations of a single mechanical
mode in-equilibrium with a heat reservoir. The device under study is a
nanomechanical beam with a first flexure resonating at 3.8MHz, cooled down to
temperatures in the range from 100mK to 400mK. The technique is constructed
around a microwave opto-mechanical setup using a cryogenic High Electron
Mobility Transistor, and is based on two parametric amplifications implemented
in series: an in-built opto-mechanical 'blue-detuned' pumping plus a Traveling
Wave Parametric Amplifier stage. We demonstrate our ability to resolve energy
fluctuations of the mechanical mode in real-time up to the fastest relevant
speed given by the mechanical relaxation rate. The energy probability
distribution is then exponential, matching the expected Boltzmann distribution.
The variance of fluctuations is found to be $(k_B T)^2$ with no free
parameters. Our microwave detection floor is about 3 Standard Quantum Limit at
6GHz; the resolution of our fastest acquisition tracks reached about 100
phonons, and is related to the rather poor opto-mechanical coupling of the
device ($g_0/2\pi\approx 0.5~$Hz). This result is deeply in the classical
regime, but shall be extended to the quantum case in the future with systems
presenting a much larger $g_0$ (up to $2\pi\times 250~$Hz), potentially
reaching the resolution of a single mechanical quantum. We believe that it will
open a new experimental field: phonon-based quantum stochastic thermodynamics,
with fundamental implications for quantum heat transport and macroscopic
mechanical quantum coherence.

<br>
<i>Carlos E. lvarez, Manuel Camargo, Gabriel Tllez</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a variation of the classical Szilard engine that uses a porous
piston. Such an engine requires neither information about the position of the
particle, nor the removal and subsequent insertion of the piston when resetting
the engine to continue doing work by lifting a mass against a gravitational
field. Though the engine operates in contact with a single thermal reservoir,
the reset mechanism acts as a second reservoir, dissipating energy when a mass
that has been lifted by the engine is removed to initiate a new operation
cycle.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08381v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08381v1</a>
<br>
<i>Ismail Sk, Nandan Pakhira</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated the electronic structure of rare-earth tetraborides,
$\textrm{RB}_{4}$, using first-principle electronic structure methods (DFT)
implemented in Quantum Espresso (QE). In this article we have studied
heather-to neglected strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects present in these
systems on the electronic structure of these system in the non-magnetic ground
state. The calculations were done under GGA and GGA+SO approximations using
ultrasoft pseudopotentials and fully relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials
(for SOC case). Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation
(PBE-GGA) exchange-correlation functionals within the linearized plane-wave
(LAPW) method as implemented in QE were used. The projected density of states
consists of 3 distinct spectral peaks well below the Fermi energy and separated
from the continuum density of states around the Fermi energy. The discrete
peaks arises due to rare-earth $s$-orbital, rare-earth $p$ + B $p$ and B
$p$-orbitals while the continuum arises due to hybridized B $p$, rare-earth $d$
orbitals. Upon inclusion of SOC the peak arising due to rare-earth $p$-orbitals
gets split into two peaks corresponding to $j=0.5$ and $j=1.5$ configurations.
In case of $\textrm{LaB}_{4}$, in the presence of SOC, spin-split $4f$ orbitals
contributes to density of states at the Fermi level while the density of states
at the Fermi level largely remains unaffected for all other materials under
consideration.

The recently discovered infinite-layer nickelates show great promise in
helping to disentangle the various cooperative mechanisms responsible for
high-temperature superconductivity. However, lack of antiferromagnetic order in
the pristine nickelates presents a challenge for connecting the physics of the
cuprates and nickelates. Here, by using a quantum many-body Green's
function-based approach to treat the electronic and magnetic structures, we
unveil the presence of many two- and three-dimensional magnetic stripe
instabilities that are shown to persist across the phase diagram of LaNiO$_2$.
Our analysis indicates that the magnetic properties of the infinite-layer
nickelates are closer to those of the doped cuprates which host inhomogeneous
ground states rather than the undoped cuprates. The computed magnon spectrum in
LaNiO$_2$ is found to contain an admixture of contributions from localized and
itinerant carriers. The theoretically obtained magnon dispersion is in accord
with the results of the corresponding RIXS experiments. Our study gives insight
into the origin of inhomogeneity in the infinite-layer nickelates and their
relationship with the cuprates.

Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene exhibits quasi-flat low-energy bands
with van Hove singularities close to the Fermi level. These singularities play
an important role in the exotic phenomena observed in this material, such as
superconductivity and magnetism, by amplifying electronic correlation effects.
In this work, we study the correspondence of four-terminal conductance and the
Fermi surface topology as a function of the twist angle, pressure, and energy
in mesoscopic samples of small-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We establish a
correspondence between features in the wide-junction conductance and the
presence of van Hove singularities in the density of states. Moreover, we
identify additional transport features, such as a large, pressure-tunable
minimal conductance, conductance peaks coinciding with non-singular band
crossings, and unusually large conductance oscillations as a function of the
system size. Our results suggest that twisted bilayer graphene close the magic
angle is a unique system featuring simultaneously large conductance due to the
quasi-flat bands, strong quantum nonlinearity due to the van Hove singularities
and high sensitivity to external parameters, which could be utilized in
high-frequency device applications and sensitive detectors.

<br>
<br>
The magnon Hedin's equations are derived via the Schwinger functional
derivative technique, and the resulting self-consistent Green's function method
is used to calculate ground state spin patterns and magnetic structure factors
for 2-dimensional magnetic systems with frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg exchange
coupling. Compared to random-phase approximation treatments, the inclusion of a
self-energy correction improves the accuracy in the case of scalar product
interactions, as shown by comparisons between our method and exact benchmarks
in homogeneous and inhomogeneous finite systems. We also find that for
cross-product interactions (e.g. antisymmetric exchange), the method does not
perform equally well, and an inclusion of higher corrections is in order. Aside
from indications for future work, our results clearly indicate that the Green's
function method in the form proposed here already shows potential advantages in
the description of systems with a large number of atoms as well as long-range
interactions.

<br>
<i>Alex Fontana, Ludovic Bellon</i>
<br>
<br>
For systems in equilibrium at a temperature T, thermal noise and energy
damping are related to T through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We
study here an extension of the FDT to an out-of-equilibrium steady state: a
micro-cantilever subject to a constant heat flux. The resulting thermal profile
in this spatially extended system interplays with the local energy dissipation
field to prescribe the amplitude of mechanical fluctuations. Using three
samples with different damping profiles (localized or distributed), we probe
this approach and experimentally demonstrate the link between fluctuations and
dissipation. The thermal noise can therefore be predicted a priori from the
measurement of the dissipation as a function of the maximum temperature of the
micro-oscillator.

<br>
<br>
The Majorana bound state can be realized in one dimensional chain, in form of
two well localized and separated states at both ends of the chain. In this
paper, we discuss the case when the potential is smeared at one end of the
system. In our investigation, we assume the smearing in form of a quadratic
function of position. We show that the smearing potential lead to the emergence
of extra in-gap states, and effectively decrease the local gap (around the
smeared potential). The Majorana states are still preserved in the system,
however, their localization depend on the smearing. Moreover, the symmetric
localization of the Majorana states from both side of the system is no longer
preserved in the presence of the smearing potential.

Interfaces between heavy metals (HMs) and antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs)
have recently become highly investigated and debated systems in the effort to
create spintronic devices able to function at terahertz frequencies. Such
heterostructures have great technological potential because AFIs can generate
sub-picosecond spin currents which the HMs can convert into charge signals. In
this work we demonstrate an optically induced picosecond spin transfer at the
interface between AFIs and Pt using time-resolved THz emission spectroscopy. We
select two antiferromagnets in the same family of fluoride cubic perovskites,
KCoF3 and KNiF3, whose magnon frequencies at the centre of the Brillouin zone
differ by an order of magnitude. By studying their behaviour with temperature
we correlate changes in the spin transfer efficiency across the interface to
the opening of a gap in the magnon density of states below the N\'eel
temperature. Our observations are reproduced in a model based on the spin
exchange between the localized electrons in the antiferromagnet and the free
electrons in Pt. These results constitute an important step in the rigorous
investigation and understanding of the physics of AFIs/HMs interfaces on the
ultrafast timescale.

How complex is an Ising model? Usually, this is measured by the computational
complexity of its ground state energy problem. Yet, this complexity measure
only distinguishes between planar and non-planar interaction graphs, and thus
fails to capture properties such as the average node degree, the number of long
range interactions, or the dimensionality of the lattice. Herein, we introduce
a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models
with respect to it. Specifically, given an Ising model we consider the decision
problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify
this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this
decision problem is (i) regular if and only if the Ising model is finite, (ii)
constructive context free if and only if the Ising model is linear and its edge
language is regular, (iii) constructive context sensitive if and only if the
edge language of the Ising model is context sensitive, and (iv) decidable if
and only if the edge language of the Ising model is decidable. We apply this
theorem to show that the 1d Ising model and the Ising model on layerwise
complete graphs are constructive context free, and the 2d Ising model, the
all-to-all Ising model, and the Ising model on perfect binary trees are
constructive context sensitive. We also provide a grammar for the 1d and 2d
Ising model. This work is a first step in the characterisation of physical
interactions in terms of grammars.

<br>
<br>
We report on a tunable - by magnetic field and gate voltage - conversion of
terahertz radiation into a dc current in spatially modulated bilayer graphene.
We experimentally demonstrate that the underlying physics is related to the
so-called ratchet effect. Our key findings are the direct observation of a
sharp cyclotron resonance in the photocurrent and the demonstration of two
effects caused by electron-electron interaction: the plasmonic splitting of the
resonance due to long-range Coulomb coupling and the partial suppression of its
second harmonic due to fast interparticle collisions. We develop a theory which
perfectly fits our data. We argue that the ratchet current is generated in the
hydrodynamic regime of non-ideal electron liquid.

Scanning tunneling electroluminescence microscopy is performed on a
3-nm-thick InGaN/GaN quantum well with x = 0.23 such that the main light
emission occurs in the green. The technique is used to map the local
recombination properties at a scale of ~10 nm and to correlate them with the
surface topography imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy. A 500 nm x 500 nm
area around a 150-nm large and 2.5-nm deep hexagonal defect is probed,
revealing emission at higher energies close to the defect edges, a feature
which is not visible in the macro-photoluminescence spectrum of the sample. Via
a fitting of the local tunneling electroluminescence spectra, quantitative
information on the fluctuations of the intensity, energy, width and phonon
replica intensity of the different spectral contributions are obtained,
revealing information about carrier localization in the quantum well. This
procedure also indicates that carrier diffusion length on the probed part of
the quantum well is approximately 40 nm.

Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics inherits the challenges of the
equilibrium, including accurately describing the joint distribution of a large
number of variables. It also poses new challenges as the joint distribution
evolves over time. While a number of methods have been proposed, e.g., tensor
networks for one-dimensional lattices, we lack a method for arbitrary finite
time in higher dimensions. In this work, we propose a general approach to study
the time evolution of nonequilibrium systems in statistical mechanics by
autoregressive neural networks. Specifically, our method offers direct sampling
and efficient computation of the normalized probabilities and dynamical
partition functions, uncovering the dynamical phase transition over time. We
apply the method to a prototype model of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics,
the kinetically constrained models of structural glasses up to three
dimensions. The obtained results reveal the phase diagram of the time and
counting field, as well as the scaling relations. Our approach paves the way
toward solving nonequilibrium statistical mechanics using tools in modern
machine learning.

<br>
<br>
Topological insulator phases of non-interacting particles have been
generalized from periodic crystals to amorphous lattices, which raises the
question whether topologically ordered quantum many-body phases may similarly
exist in amorphous systems? Here we construct a soluble chiral amorphous
quantum spin liquid by extending the Kitaev honeycomb model to random lattices
with fixed coordination number three. The model retains its exact solubility
but the presence of plaquettes with an odd number of sides leads to a
spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry. We unearth a rich phase diagram
displaying Abelian as well as a non-Abelian quantum spin liquid phases with a
remarkably simple ground state flux pattern. Furthermore, we show that the
system undergoes a finite-temperature phase transition to a conducting thermal
metal state and discuss possible experimental realisations.

The antiferromagnetic semiconductor CuFeS$_2$ belongs to a magnetic symmetry
class that is of interest for spintronics applications. In addition, its
crystal lattice is compatible with Si, making it possible to integrate it with
non-magnetic semiconducting structures. Therefore, we investigate this material
by finding the effective $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ Hamiltonian for
the electron- and hole bands. We base this description on \textit{ab initio}
calculations and classify the electronic bands by their symmetry. As a result,
we find that CuFeS$_2$ exhibits spin-polarized bands and an anomalous Hall
effect. Finally, we suggest using cyclotron resonance to verify our proposed
effective mass tensors at the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum.

Lattice field theory is a very powerful tool to study Feynman's path integral
non-perturbatively. However, it usually requires Euclidean background metrics
to be well-defined. On the other hand, a recently developed regularization
scheme based on Fourier integral operator $\zeta$-functions can treat Feynman's
path integral non-pertubatively in Lorentzian background metrics. In this
article, we formally $\zeta$-regularize lattice theories with Lorentzian
backgrounds and identify conditions for the Fourier integral operator
$\zeta$-function regularization to be applicable. Furthermore, we show that the
classical limit of the $\zeta$-regularized theory is independent of the
regularization. Finally, we consider the harmonic oscillator as an explicit
example. We discuss multiple options for the regularization and analytically
show that they all reproduce the correct ground state energy on the lattice and
in the continuum limit. Additionally, we solve the harmonic oscillator on the
lattice in Minkowski background numerically.
