<h3>Preparing and Analyzing Solitons in the sine-Gordon Model with Quantum  Gas Microscopes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16221" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16221</a>

The sine-Gordon model emerges as a low-energy theory in a plethora of quantum
many-body systems. Here, we theoretically investigate tunnel-coupled
Bose-Hubbard chains with strong repulsive interactions as a realization of the
sine-Gordon model deep in the quantum regime. We propose protocols for quantum
gas microscopes of ultracold atoms to prepare and analyze solitons, that are
the fundamental topological excitations of the emergent sine-Gordon theory.
With numerical simulations based on matrix product states we characterize the
preparation and detection protocols and discuss the experimental requirements.

While the existence of a magnetic field induced quantum spin liquid in Kitaev
magnets remains under debate, its topological properties often extend to
proximal phases where they can lead to unusual behaviors of both fundamental
and applied interests. Subjecting a generic nearest neighbor spin model of
Kitaev magnets to a sufficiently strong in-plane magnetic field, we study the
resulting polarized phase and the associated magnon excitations. In contrast to
the case of an out-of-plane magnetic field where the magnon band topology is
enforced by a three-fold symmetry, we find that it is possible for
topologically trivial and nontrivial parameter regimes to coexist under
in-plane magnetic fields. We map out the topological phase diagrams of the
magnon bands, revealing a rich pattern of variation of the Chern number over
the parameter space and the field angle. We further compute the magnon thermal
Hall conductivity as a weighted summation of Berry curvatures, and discuss
experimental implications of our results to planar thermal Hall effects in
Kitaev magnets.

<br>
<br>
Atom probe tomography (APT) is a 3D analysis technique that offers unique
chemical accuracy and sensitivity with sub-nanometer spatial resolution.
Recently, there is an increasing interest in the application of APT to complex
oxides materials, giving new insight into the relation between local variations
in chemical composition and emergent physical properties. However, in contrast
to the field of metallurgy, where APT is routinely applied to study materials
at the atomic level, complex oxides and their specific field evaporation
mechanisms are much less explored. Here, we perform APT measurements on the
hexagonal manganite ErMnO3 and systematically study the effect of different
experimental parameters on the measured composition and atomic structure. We
demonstrate that both the mass resolving power (MRP) and compositional accuracy
can be improved by increasing the charge-state ratio (CSR) working at low laser
energy (< 5 pJ). Furthermore, we observe a substantial preferential retention
of Er atoms, which is suppressed at higher CSRs. We explain our findings based
on fundamental field evaporation concepts, expanding the knowledge about the
impact of key experimental parameters and the field evaporation process in
complex oxides in general.

<h3>Anomalous superconducting diode effect in a polar superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16238</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Kealhofer, Hanbyeol Jeong, Arman Rashidi, Leon Balents, Susanne Stemmer</i>
<br>
<br>
A superconductor with broken time reversal and inversion symmetry may exhibit
nonreciprocal charge transport, including a nonreciprocal critical current,
also known as superconducting diode effect. We report an intrinsic
superconducting diode effect in a polar strontium titanate film. Differential
resistance measurements reveal a superconducting state whose depairing current
is polarity dependent. There is, however, no measurable deviation from Ohmic
behavior, implying that this state does not arise from a bulk magnetochiral
anisotropy. In the entire measurement range, the only deviation from linearity
in the differential resistance is on the edge of the superconducting transition
at high magnetic fields, likely due to the motion of flux vortices.
Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect is preserved even when the in-plane
magnetic field is oriented parallel to the current, indicating that this effect
truly does not originate from a bulk magnetochiral anisotropy.

<h3>Antisymmetric Breaking of Voltage Gauge Invariance due to Majorana  States in Magnetic Topological Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16261</a>
<br>
<i>Daniele Di Miceli, Eduárd Zsurka, Julian Legendre, Kristof Moors, Thomas Schmidt, Llorenç Serra</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically discuss how Majorana bound states and Majorana chiral
propagating states break voltage gauge invariance of electric transport in
specific ways. While the breaking of voltage gauge invariance can be
generically related to Andreev processes at interfaces, an antisymmetric
conductance with respect to the point of equally split bias across a
normal-superconductor-normal (NSN) junction is a more specific signal of
topologically-protected Majorana modes. These electric signatures are discussed
in NSN junctions made with narrow (wire-like) or wide (film-like) magnetic
topological insulator slabs with a central proximitized superconducting sector.

<h3>Programming hydrogel adhesion with engineered polymer network topology</h3>

Hydrogel adhesion that can be easily modulated in magnitude, space, and time
is desirable in many emerging applications ranging from tissue engineering, and
soft robotics, to wearable devices. In synthetic materials, these complex
adhesion behaviors are often achieved individually with mechanisms and
apparatus that are difficult to integrate. Here, we report a universal strategy
to embody multifaceted adhesion programmability in synthetic hydrogels. By
designing the surface network topology of a hydrogel, supramolecular linkages
that result in contrasting adhesion behaviors are formed on the hydrogel
interface. The incorporation of different topological linkages leads to
dynamically tunable adhesion with high-resolution spatial programmability
without alteration of bulk mechanics and chemistry. Further, the association of
linkages enables stable and tunable adhesion kinetics that can be tailored to
suit different applications. We rationalize the physics of chain slippage,
rupture, and diffusion that underpins emergent programmable behaviors. We then
incorporate the strategy into the designs of various devices such as smart
wound patches, fluidic channels, drug-eluting devices, and reconfigurable soft
robotics. Our study presents a simple and robust platform in which adhesion
controllability in multiple aspects can be easily integrated into a single
design of a hydrogel network.

<h3>Two-step flux synthesis of ultrapure transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
Here, we describe synthesis of TMD crystals using a two-step flux growth
method that eliminates a major potential source of contamination. Detailed
characterization of TMDs grown by this two-step method reveals charged and
isovalent defects with densities an order of magnitude lower than in TMDs grown
by a single-step flux technique. Initial temperature-dependent electrical
transport measurements of monolayer WSe2 yield room-temperature hole mobility
above 840 cm2/Vs and low-temperature disorder-limited mobility above 44,000
cm2/Vs. Electrical transport measurements of graphene-WSe2 heterostructures
fabricated from the two-step flux grown WSe2 also show superior performance:
higher graphene mobility, lower charged impurity density, and well-resolved
integer quantum Hall states.

<h3>Effects of lattice geometry on thermopower properties of the repulsive  Hubbard mode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16291" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16291</a>
<br>
<i>Willdauany C. de Freitas Silva, Maykon V. M. Araujo, Sayantan Roy, Abhisek Samanta, Natanael de C. Costa, Nandini Trivedi, Thereza Paiva</i>
<br>
<br>
We obtain the Seebeck coefficient or thermopower $S$, which determines the
conversion efficiency from thermal to electrical energy, for the
two-dimensional Hubbard model on different geometries (square, triangular, and
honeycomb lattices) for different electronic densities and interaction
strengths. Using Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) we find the following
key results: (a) the bi-partiteness of the lattice affects the doping
dependence of $S$; (b) strong electronic correlations can greatly enhance $S$
and produce non-trivial sign changes as a function of doping especially in the
vicinity of the Mott insulating phase; (c) $S(T)$ near half filling can show
non-monotonic behavior as a function of temperature. We emphasize the role of
strong interaction effects in engineering better devices for energy storage and
applications, as captured by our calculations of the power factor $PF=S^2
\sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the dc conductivity.

<h3>Analysis of ultrafast magnetization switching dynamics in  exchange-coupled ferromagnet-ferrimagnet heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16294" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16294</a>
<br>
<i>Debanjan Polley, Jyotirmoy Chatterjee, Hyejin Jang, Jeffrey Bokor</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetization switching in ferromagnets has so far been limited to the
current-induced spin-orbit-torque effects. Recent observation of
helicity-independent all-optical magnetization switching in exchange-coupled
ferromagnet ferrimagnet heterostructures expanded the range and applicability
of such ultrafast heat-driven magnetization switching. Here we report the
element-resolved switching dynamics of such an exchange-coupled system, using a
modified microscopic three-temperature model. We have studied the effect of i)
the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet, ii) ferrimagnet composition, iii) the
long-range RKKY exchange-coupling strength, and iv) the absorbed optical energy
on the element-specific time-resolved magnetization dynamics. The phase-space
of magnetization illustrates how the RKKY coupling strength and the absorbed
optical energy influence the switching time. Our analysis demonstrates that the
threshold switching energy depends on the composition of the ferrimagnet and
the switching time depends on the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet as well
as RKKY coupling strength. This simulation anticipates new insights into
developing faster and more energy-efficient spintronics devices.

<h3>Thermodynamic Interpretaion of Entanglement in Canonical Nonlinearity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16311</a>
<br>
<i>Koretaka Yuge</i>
<br>
<br>
For classical discrete system under constant composition, typically reffered
to as substitutional alloys, canonical average acts as nonlinear map F from a
set of potential energy surface U to that of microscopic configuration in
thermodynamic equilibrium, Q, which is called canonical nonlinearity (CN). On
statistical manifold, at any given configuration, F can be divided into the sum
of local and non-local contribution in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence, where the former has strong positive correlation with time
evolution of the nonlinearity (NOL) on configuration space (called
anharmonicity in structural degree of freedoms (ASDF), while the latter,
corresponding to entanglement in SDFs, does exhibit clear correlation with the
ASDF. On the other hand, our recent work bridge the different concepts of NOL
on configuration space and statistical manifold through stochastic
thermodynamics. While the work successfully provides clear relationships
between the changes in total NOL through system transition and heat transfer,
thermodynamic interpretation of how the entanglment in SDFs contributes to
thermodynamic functions, is totally unclear due mainly to its non-trivial,
non-local character. The present study tackle this problem, deriving upper
bound for the entanglement for any given transition in terms of the mutual
information, heat transfer and free energy. The present thermodynamic
interpretaion will provide quantitative description of how the entanglement in
SDFs is dominated by configuration of ground-state structures on configuration
space.

<h3>Tutorial: Nonlinear magnonics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear magnonics studies the nonlinear interaction between magnons and
other physical platforms (phonon, photon, qubit, spin texture) to generate
novel magnon states for information processing. In this tutorial, we first
introduce the nonlinear interactions of magnons in pure magnetic systems and
hybrid magnon-phonon and magnon-photon systems. Then we show how these
nonlinear interactions can generate exotic magnonic phenomena. In the classical
regime, we will cover the parametric excitation of magnons, bistability and
multistability, and the magnonic frequency comb. In the quantum regime, we will
discuss the single magnon state, Schr\"{o}dinger cat state and the entanglement
and quantum steering among magnons, photons and phonons. The applications of
the hybrid magnonics systems in quantum transducer and sensing will also be
presented. Finally, we outlook the future development direction of nonlinear
magnonics.

<h3>Engineering the formation of spin-defects from first principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16319</a>
<br>
<i>Cunzhi Zhang, Francois Gygi, Giulia Galli</i>
<br>
<br>
The full realization of spin qubits for quantum technologies relies on the
ability to control and design the formation processes of spin defects in
semiconductors and insulators. We present a computational protocol to
investigate the synthesis of point-defects at the atomistic level, and we apply
it to the study of a promising spin-qubit in silicon carbide, the divacancy
(VV). Our strategy combines electronic structure calculations based on density
functional theory and enhanced sampling techniques coupled with first
principles molecular dynamics. We predict the optimal annealing temperatures
for the formation of VVs at high temperature and show how to engineer the Fermi
level of the material to optimize the defect's yield for several polytypes of
silicon carbide. Our results are in excellent agreement with available
experimental data and provide novel atomistic insights into point defect
formation and annihilation processes as a function of temperature.

<h3>Hall conductivity as the topological invariant in magnetic Brillouin  zone in the presence of interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16327" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16327</a>
<br>
<i>M. Selch, M. Suleymanov, C. X. Zhang, M. A. Zubkov</i>
<br>
<br>
Hall conductivity for the intrinsic anomalous quantum Hall effect in
homogeneous systems is given by the topological invariant composed of the Green
function depending on momentum of quasiparticle. This expression reveals
correspondence with the mathematical notion of the degree of mapping. A more
involved situation takes place for the quantum Hall effect in the presence of
external magnetic field. In this case the mentioned expression remains valid if
the Green function is taken in a specific representation, where it becomes the
infinite - dimensional matrix \cite{Imai:1990zz} or if it is replaced by its
Wigner transformation while ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal
products \cite{ZW2019}. Both these expressions, unfortunately, are much more
complicated and might be useless for the practical calculations. Here we
represent the alternative representation for the Hall conductivity of a uniform
system in the presence of constant magnetic field. The Hall conductivity is
expressed through the Green function taken in Harper representation, when its
nonhomogeneity is attributed to the matrix structure while functional
dependence is on one momentum that belongs to magnetic Brillouin zone. Our
consideration for the interacting systems is non - perturbative and is based on
the Schwinger - Dyson equations truncated in a reasonable way. We demonstrate
that in this approximation the expression for the Hall conductivity in Harper
representation remains valid, where the interacting Green function is to be
used instead of the non - interacting one. We, therefore, propose that the
obtained expression may be used for the topological description of fractional
quantum Hall effect.

<h3>Jarzynski equality for quasistatic work</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16337</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre Nazé</i>
<br>
<br>
To prove a fluctuation theorem that connects the fluctuations of a work with
the average quasistatic work, I show that a thermally isolated system
performing an adiabatic driven process has associated another system performing
an isothermal driven one. This isothermal process has a temperature equal to
that one of the initial equilibrium state of the thermally isolated system, and
its difference of Helmholtz free energy between the final and initial
equilibrium states is equal to the average quasistatic work of the original
process. The application of the usual Jarzynski equality for this isothermal
process is therefore straightforward. However, for the complexity of the new
system, check proofs corroborating this Jarzynski equality are lacking.

<h3>Revisiting Bloch electrons in magnetic field: Hofstadter physics via  hybrid Wannier states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16347" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16347</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoyu Wang, Oskar Vafek</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the Hofstadter butterfly for a subset of topologically trivial
Bloch bands arising from a continuum free electron Hamiltonian in a periodic
lattice potential. We employ the recently developed procedure -- which was
previously used to analyze the case of topologically non-trivial bands
[\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.L121111}{Phys.
Rev. B \textbf{106}, L121111 (2022)}] -- to construct the finite field Hilbert
space from the zero-field hybrid Wannier basis states. Such states are Bloch
extended along one direction and exponentially localized along the other. The
method is illustrated for square and triangular lattice potentials and is shown
to reproduce all the main features of the Hofstadter spectrum obtained from a
numerically exact Landau level expansion method.
In the regime when magnetic length is much longer than the spatial extent of
the hybrid Wannier state in the localized direction we recover the well known
Harper equation. Because the method applies to both topologically trivial and
non-trivial bands, it provides an alternative and efficient approach to moir\'e
materials in magnetic field.

<h3>Electrolyte Coatings for High Adhesion Interfaces in Solid-state  Batteries from First Principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16350" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16350</a>
<br>
<i>Brandi Ransom, Akash Ramdas, Eder Lomeli, Jad Fidawi, Austin Sendek, Thomas Devereaux, Evan Reed, Peter Schindler</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce an adhesion parameter that enables rapid screening for materials
interfaces with high adhesion. This parameter is obtained by density functional
theory calculations of individual single-material slabs rather than slabs
consisting of combinations of two materials, eliminating the need to calculate
all configurations of a prohibitively vast space of possible interface
configurations. Cleavage energy calculations are used as an upper bound for
electrolyte and coating energies and implemented in an adapted contact angle
equation to derive the adhesion parameter. In addition to good adhesion, we
impose further constraints in electrochemical stability window, abundance, bulk
reactivity, and stability to screen for coating materials for next-generation
solid-state batteries. Good adhesion is critical in combating delamination and
resistance to Lithium diffusivity in solid-state batteries. Here, we identify
several promising coating candidates for the Li7La3Zr2O12 and sulfide
electrolyte systems including the previously investigated electrode coating
materials LiAlSiO4 and Li5AlO8, making them especially attractive for
experimental optimization and commercialization.

<h3>Comprehensive ab initio study of effects of alloying elements on  generalized stacking fault energies of Ni and Ni$_3$Al</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16379</a>
<br>
<i>Heyu Zhu, Jiantao Wang, Yun Chen, Mingfeng Liu, Hui Ma, Yan Sun, Peitao Liu, Xing-Qiu Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
Excellent high-temperature mechanical properties of Ni-based single crystal
superalloys (NSCSs) are attributed to the yield strength anomaly of Ni$_{3}$Al
that is intimately related to generalized stacking fault energies (GSFEs).
Therefore, clarifying the effects of alloying elements on the GSFEs is of great
significance for alloys design. Here, by means of ab initio density functional
theory calculations, we systematically calculated the GSFEs of different slip
systems of Ni and Ni$_{3}$Al without and with alloying elements using the alias
shear method. We obtained that for Ni, except for magnetic elements Mn, Fe, and
Co, most of alloying elements decrease the unstable stacking fault energy
($\gamma_{usf}$) of the $[01\bar{1}](111)$ and $[11\bar{2}](111)$ slip systems
and also decrease the stable stacking fault energy ($\gamma_{sf}$) of the
$[11\bar{2}](111)$ slip system. For Ni$_{3}$Al, most of alloying elements in
groups IIIB-VIIB show a strong Al site preference. Except for Mn and Fe, the
elements in groups VB-VIIB and the first column of group VIII increase the
values of $\gamma_{usf}$ of different slip systems of Ni$_{3}$Al. On the other
hand, the elements in groups IIIB-VIIB also increase the value of
$\gamma_{sf}$. We found that Re is an excellent strengthening alloying element
that significantly increases the slip barrier of the tailing slip process for
Ni, and also enhances the slip barrier of the leading slip process of three
slip systems for Ni$_{3}$Al. W and Mo exhibit similar effects as Re. We
predicted that Os, Ru, and Ir are good strengthening alloying elements as well,
since they show the strengthening effects on both the leading and tailing slip
process for Ni and Ni$_{3}$Al.

<br>
<br>
Continuous spin excitations are widely recognized as one of the hallmarks of
novel spin states in quantum magnets, such as quantum spin liquids (QSLs).
Here, we report the observation of such kind of excitations in K2Ni2(SO4)3,
which consists of two sets of intersected spin-1 Ni2+ trillium lattices. Our
inelastic neutron scattering measurement on single crystals clearly shows a
dominant excitation continuum, which exhibits a distinct temperature-dependent
behavior from that of spin waves, and is rooted in strong quantum spin
fluctuations. Further using the self-consistent-gaussian-approximation method,
we determined the fourth- and fifth-nearest neighbor exchange interactions are
dominant. These two bonds together form a unique three-dimensional network of
corner-sharing tetrahedra, which we name as ''hyper-trillium'' lattice. Our
results provide direct evidence for the existence of QSL features in
K2Ni2(SO4)3 and highlight the potential for the hyper-trillium lattice to host
frustrated quantum magnetism.

We present a multimodal deep learning (MDL) framework for predicting physical
properties of a 10-dimensional acrylic polymer composite material by merging
physical attributes and chemical data. Our MDL model comprises four modules,
including three generative deep learning models for material structure
characterization and a fourth model for property prediction. Our approach
handles an 18-dimensional complexity, with 10 compositional inputs and 8
property outputs, successfully predicting 913,680 property data points across
114,210 composition conditions. This level of complexity is unprecedented in
computational materials science, particularly for materials with undefined
structures. We propose a framework to analyze the high-dimensional information
space for inverse material design, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability
to various materials and scales, provided sufficient data is available. This
study advances future research on different materials and the development of
more sophisticated models, drawing us closer to the ultimate goal of predicting
all properties of all materials.

<h3>Weak Localization and Antilocalization in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Hongyi Yan, Haiwen Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization
(WAL) effects in twisted bilayer graphene that placed in alignment on a
hexagonal boron nitride substrate. The low-energy band of the top layer
exhibits a Dirac cone with a negligible gap, while the bottom layer has a
relatively large band gap. The system features a low concentration of
impurities, and the quantum correction to the conductivity arises from the
quantum interference between two time-reversed impurity scattering
trajectories. Through bias voltage tuning, we find that inter-layer scattering
significantly contributes to the conductivity correction when the Fermi surface
areas of the two valleys at low energy are comparable. We observe a double
crossover from WL to WAL and back to WL at a specific range of Fermi energy,
which is a particularly intriguing phenomenon.

<br>
<br>
Fabrication of chiral assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles is a highly
attractive and challenging task with promising applications in light emission,
detection, and sensing. So far, primarily organic chiral templates have been
used for chirality inscription. However, this significantly limits the variety
of nanoparticle preparation techniques to an in-pot approach at very low
synthesis temperatures. Here, we demonstrate utilization of seemingly achiral
inorganic nanotubes as templates for the chiral assembly of nanoparticles. We
show that both metallic and dielectric nanoparticles can be attached to
scroll-like chiral edges propagating on the surfaces of WS2 nanotubes. Due to
relatively high temperature stability of these nanotubes, such assembly can be
performed at temperatures as high as 550 {\deg}C. This large temperature range
significantly widens the portfolio of usable nanoparticle fabrication
techniques, allowing us to demonstrate a variety of chiral nanoparticle
assemblies, ranging from metals (Au, Ga) and semiconductors (Ge) to oxides
(WO3).

<br>
<br>
We describe a setup of time-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (tr-SARPES) employing a 10.7-eV ($\lambda$=115.6 nm) pulse laser
at 1-MHz repetition rate as a probe photon source. This equipment effectively
combines technologies of a high-power Yb:fiber laser, ultraviolet-driven
harmonic generation in Xe gas, and a SARPES apparatus equipped with
very-low-energy-electron-diffraction (VLEED) spin detectors. A high repetition
rate (1 MHz) of the probe laser allows experiments with the photoemission
space-charge effects significantly reduced, despite a high flux of 10$^{13}$
photons/s on the sample. The relatively high photon energy (10.7 eV) also
brings the capability of observing a wide momentum range that covers the entire
Brillouin zone of many materials while ensuring high momentum resolution. The
experimental setup overcomes a low efficiency of spin-resolved measurements,
which gets even more severe for the pump-probed unoccupied states, and affords
for investigating ultrafast electron and spin dynamics of modern quantum
materials with energy and time resolutions of 25 meV and 360 fs, respectively.

Magnetic skyrmions are magnetic quasi-particles with enhanced stability and
different manipulation mechanisms using external fields and currents making
them promising candidates for future applications for instance in neuromorphic
computing. Recently, several measurements and simulations have shown that
thermally activated skyrmions in confined geometries, as they are necessary for
device applications, arrange themselves predominantly based on commensurability
effects. In this simulational study, based on the Thiele model, we investigate
the enhanced dynamics and degenerate non-equilibrium steady state of a system
in which the intrinsic skyrmion-skyrmion and skyrmion-boundary interaction
compete with thermal fluctuations as well as current-induced spin-orbit
torques. The investigated system is a triangular-shaped confinement geometry
hosting four skyrmions, where we inject spin-polarized currents between two
corners of the structure. We coarse-grain the skyrmion states in the system to
analyze the intricacies of skyrmion arrangements of the skyrmion ensemble. In
the context of neuromorphic computing, such methods address the key challenge
of optimizing read-out positions in confined geometries and form the basis to
understand collective skyrmion dynamics in systems with competing interactions
on different scales.

<h3>Reexamining the doped two-legged Hubbard ladders</h3>

<br>
<i>Yang Shen, Guang-Ming Zhang, Mingpu Qin</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the ground state of the Hubbard model on 2-legged ladders in this
work. We perform DMRG calculation on large system sizes with large kept states
and perform extrapolation of DMRG results with truncation errors in the
converged region. We find the superconducting correlation exponent $K_{sc}$
extracted from the pair-pair correlation is very sensitive to the position of
the reference bond, reflecting a huge boundary effect on it. By systematically
removing the effects from boundary conditions, finite sizes, and truncation
errors in DMRG, we obtain the most accurate value of $K_{sc}$ and $K_\rho$ so
far with DMRG. With these exponents, we confirm that the 2-legged Hubbard model
is in the Luther-Emery liquid phase with $K_{sc} \cdot K_\rho = 1$ from tiny
doping near half-filling to $1/8$ hole doping. When the doping is increased to
$\delta \gtrapprox 1/6$, the behaviors of charge, pairing, and spin
correlations don't change qualitatively, but the relationship $K_{sc} \cdot
K_\rho = 1$ is likely to be violated. With the further increase of the doping
to $\delta = 1/3$, the quasi long-ranged charge correlation turns to a true
long-ranged charge order and the spin gap is closed, while the pair-pair
correlation still decays algebraically.

<h3>Effect of shatterproof polymer film application on the fracture types  and strength of glass subject to bending load</h3>

<br>
<br>
Shatterproof polymer films are widely for windows used because they can be
easily installed on existing glass windows to improve safety. Applying them to
glass plates has been reported to not only prevent fragments from scattering
but also increase load-bearing capacity and penetration resistance. However,
the clarification of their mechanism and quantitative evaluation are still
insufficient because the effect of film application on the strength and failure
mode of glass under quasi-static loading has not been investigated. In this
study, three-point bending tests and fracture surface observations were
conducted on a float glass with a shatterproof polymer film. The stress field
formed inside the glass was visualised during the tests using the photoelastic
method. By varying the support span of the specimen, the deformation mode was
varied to generate three types of failures: bending, shear caused by Hertzian
contact stress, and mixed-mode failures. Under the conditions in the present
study, the breaking loads of the specimens with and without film were almost
the same; however, the fracture surface observation indicated that the area
subjected to shear failure caused by Hertzian contact stress was larger with
film application. Finally, the effect of the film thickness on the breaking
load due to bending deformation was theoretically predicted.

The B phase of superfluid 3He can be cooled into the "pure" superfluid
regime, characterised by negligible thermal quasiparticle density. Here, the
bulk superfluid is bounded by a two-dimensional quantum well at the boundaries
of the container, where creating quasiparticles requires much less energy. In
this Article, we carry out experiments where we create a non-equilibrium state
within the quantum well and show that the induced quasiparticle currents flow
diffusively in the two-dimensional system. We conclude that the bulk of
superfluid 3He is wrapped by an independent two-dimensional superfluid that
interacts with mechanical probes instead of the bulk superfluid, only providing
access to the bulk superfluid if given a sudden burst of energy. That is,
superfluid 3He at the lowest temperatures and applied energies is
thermo-mechanically two dimensional. Our work opens this two-dimensional
quantum condensate and the interface it forms between the observer and the bulk
superfluid for exploration, and provides the possibility of creating
two-dimensional condensates of arbitrary topology.

<h3>The Backtracking Dynamical Cavity Method</h3>

<br>
<br>
The cavity method is one of the cornerstones of the statistical physics of
disordered systems such as spin glasses and other complex systems. It is able
to analytically and asymptotically exactly describe the equilibrium properties
of a broad range of models. Exact solutions for dynamical, out-of-equilibrium
properties of disordered systems are traditionally much harder to obtain. Even
very basic questions such as the limiting energy of a fast quench are so far
open. The dynamical cavity method partly fills this gap by considering short
trajectories and leveraging the static cavity method. However, being limited to
a couple of steps forward from the initialization it does not capture many of
the interesting dynamical properties that appear at later times in the
dynamics. We introduce the backtracking dynamical cavity method that instead of
analysing the trajectory forward from initialization, analyses trajectories
that are found by tracking them backward from attractors. We illustrate that
this rather elementary twist on the dynamical cavity method leads to new
insight into some of the very basic questions about the dynamics of complex
disordered systems. This method is as versatile as the cavity method itself and
we hence anticipate that our paper will open many avenues for future research
of dynamical, out-of-equilibrium, properties in complex systems.

Driven by recent developments in time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
extend the successful method of photoemission orbital tomography (POT) to
excited states. Our theory retains the intuitive orbital picture of POT, while
respecting both the entangled character of the exciton wave function and the
energy conservation in the process. Analyzing results from three organic
molecules, we classify generic exciton structures and give a simple
interpretation in terms of natural transition orbitals. We validate our
findings by directly simulating pump-probe experiments with time-dependent
density functional theory.

Integrable Quantum Field Theories can be solved exactly using bootstrap
techniques based on their elastic and factorisable S-matrix. While knowledge of
the scattering amplitudes reveals the exact spectrum of particles and their
on-shell dynamics, the expression of the matrix elements of the various
operators allows the reconstruction of off-shell quantities such as two-point
correlation functions with a high level of precision. In this review, we
summarise results relevant to the contact point between theory and experiment
providing a number of quantities that can be computed theoretically with great
accuracy. We concentrate on universal amplitude ratios which can be determined
from the measurement of generalised susceptibilities, and dynamical structure
factors, which can be accessed experimentally e.g. via inelastic neutron
scattering or nuclear magnetic resonance. Besides an overview of the subject
and a summary of recent advances, we also present new results regarding
generalised susceptibilities in the tricritical Ising universality class.

<br>
Spin-orbit coupling has been reported to be responsible for the insulating
nature of the 5d$^1$ osmate double perovskite Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ (BNOO). However,
whether spin-orbit coupling indeed drives the metal-to-insulator transition
(MIT) in this compound is an open question. In this work we investigate the
impact of relativistic effects on the electronic properties of BNOO via density
functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory calculations in the
paramagnetic regime, where the insulating phase is experimentally observed. The
correlated subspace is modeled with non-collinear projectors of the projector
augumented wave method (PAW) employed in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation
Package (VASP), suitably interfaced with the TRIQS package. The inclusion of
PAW non-collinear projectors in TRIQS enables the treatment of spin-orbit
coupling effects fully ab-initio within the dynamical mean-field theory
framework. In the present work, we show that spin-orbit coupling, although
assisting the MIT in BNOO, is not the main driving force for its gapped
spectra, placing this material in the Mott insulator regime. Relativistic
effects primarily impact the correlated states' character, excitations, and
magnetic ground-state properties.

<h3>Correlations of tensor field components in isotropic systems with an  application to stress correlations in elastic bodies</h3>

<br>
<br>
Correlation functions of components of second-order tensor fields in
isotropic systems can be reduced to an isotropic forth-order tensor field
characterized by a few invariant correlation functions (ICFs). It is emphasized
that components of this field depend in general on the coordinates of the field
vector variable and thus on the orientation of the coordinate system. These
angular dependencies are distinct from those of ordinary anisotropic systems.
As a simple example of the procedure to obtain the ICFs we discuss correlations
of time-averaged stresses in isotropic glasses where only one ICF in reciprocal
space is a finite constant for large sampling times and small wavevectors. In
turn this explains the observed long-range stress correlations in real space.

<h3>Shear-induced reinforcement in boehmite gels: a rheo-X-ray-scattering  study</h3>

<br>
Boehmite, an aluminum oxide hydroxide $\gamma$-AlO(OH), is broadly used in
the form of particulate dispersions in industrial applications, e.g., for the
fabrication of ceramics and catalyst supports or as a binder for extrusion
processes. Under acidic conditions, colloidal boehmite dispersions at rest form
gels, i.e., space-spanning percolated networks that behave as soft solids at
rest, and yet yield and flow like liquids under large enough deformations. Like
many other colloidal gels, the solid-like properties of boehmite gels at rest
are very sensitive to their previous mechanical history. Our recent work
[Sudreau et al., J. Rheol. 66, 91-104 (2022), and Phys. Rev. Material 6,
L042601 (2022)] has revealed such \textit{memory effects}, where the shear
experienced prior to flow cessation drives the elasticity of boehmite gels:
while gels formed following application of a shear rate $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$
larger than a critical value $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$ are insensitive to shear
history, gels formed after application of $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}<\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$ display reinforced viscoelastic properties and non-negligible residual
stresses. Here, we provide a microstructural scenario for these striking
observations by coupling rheometry and small-angle X-ray scattering.
Time-resolved measurements for $\dot\gamma_{\rm p} <\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$ show
that scattering patterns develop an anisotropic shape that persists upon flow
cessation, whereas gels exposed to $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}>\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$
display isotropic scattering patterns upon flow cessation. Moreover, as the
shear rate applied prior to flow cessation is decreased below $\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$, the level of anisotropy frozen in the sample microstructure grows
similarly to the viscoelastic properties, thus providing a direct link between
mechanical reinforcement and flow-induced microstructural anisotropy.

<h3>Machine-Learning Surrogate Model for Accelerating the Search of Stable  Ternary Alloys</h3>

The prediction of phase diagrams in the search for new phases is a complex
and computationally intensive task. Density functional theory provides, in many
situations, the desired accuracy, but its throughput becomes prohibitively
limited as the number of species involved grows, even when used with local and
semi-local functionals. Here, we explore the possibility of integrating
machine-learning models in the workflow for the construction of ternary convex
hull diagrams. In particular, we train a set of spectral neighbour-analysis
potentials (SNAPs) over readily available binary phases and we establish
whether this is good enough to predict the energies of novel ternaries. Such a
strategy does not require any new calculations specific for the construction of
the model, but just avails of data stored in binary-phase-diagram repositories.
We find that a so-constructed SNAP is capable of accurate total-energy
estimates for ternary phases close to the equilibrium geometry but, in general,
is not able to perform atomic relaxation. This is because during a typical
relaxation path a given phase traverses regions in the parameter space poorly
represented by the training set. Different metrics are then investigated to
assess how an unknown structure is well described by a given SNAP model, and we
find that the standard deviation of an ensemble of SNAPs provides a fast and
non-specie-specific metric.

<h3>Identification of Griffiths-like phase and its evolution in Cr  substituted pyrochlore iridates $Y_2Ir_2O_7$</h3>

We report the Griffiths phase (GP)-like state along with cluster-glass-like
state in geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic $Cr$ substituted
$Y_2Ir_2O_7$ pyrochlore iridates. The strength of GP-like behaviour increases
with substitution. Interestingly, isothermal remanent magnetization suggests
the Ising-like interaction of spins in GP region. The GP-like state is not
attributed to the structural disorder as substitution of Cr does not induces
any structural change. Then the spin coupling between $Cr^{3+} \leftrightarrow
Cr^{3+}$, $Ir^{4+} \leftrightarrow Ir^{4+}$, $Ir^{4+} \leftrightarrow Cr^{3+}$
and $Ir^{4+} \leftrightarrow Ir^{5+}$ leads the competition between
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic correlations. It give rise to
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-like interaction between $Cr^{3+}$ local
magnetic moments mediated by itinerant $Ir$ conduction electrons, hence, as a
result GP and cluster-glass-like states emerges.

<br>

Topological excitonic insulators combine topological edge states and
spontaneous exciton condensation, with dual functionality of topological
insulators and excitonic insulators. Yet, they are very rare and little is
known about their formation. In this work, we find that a mechanism dubbed as
parity frustration prevents excitonic instability in usual topological
insulators, and those whose band inversion is independent of spin-orbit
coupling are possible candidates. We verify this by first-principles
calculations on monolayer transition-metal carbides (MXenes), which show a
robust thermal-equilibrium exciton condensation, being sufficient for
topological applications at room temperature. Such a state can be identified by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport measurement. Our work
provides not only a guide for finding more topological excitonic insulators,
but also a new platform for studying the interplay between non-trivial band
topology and quantum many-body effects.

We describe dynamics of transverse spin-helix state (SHS) -- a product state
with spatially rotating magnetization -- under anisotropic Heisenberg spin
chain evolution. Due to experimental relevance we especially focus on
magnetization dynamics. At long times the $U(1)$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian is
restored, leading to the decay of transverse magnetization, which can be
described as an exponential decay of a spatially harmonic profile. We show that
the dependence of the short and intermediate-time decay timescale, which in
principle depends on all different parameters, like the wavevector of the
initial helix, the anisotropy, etc., can be described well by a single scaling
function. We also briefly discuss the evolution of magnetization current.

<br>
<br>
Autonomous active Brownian ratchets rectify active Brownian particle motion
solely by means of a spatially modulated but stationary activity, without
external forces. We argue that such ratcheting requires at least a
two-dimensional geometry. The underlying principle is similar to the ratcheting
induced by steric obstacles in microswimmer baths: suitably polarized swimmers
get channeled, while the others get trapped in low-activity regions until they
loose direction. The maximum current is generally reached in the limit of large
propulsion speeds, in which the rectification efficiency vanishes. Maximum
efficiency is attained at intermediate activities and numerically found to be
on the order of a few percent, for ratchets with simple wedge-shaped
low-activity regions.

We study the critical behavior at the ordinary surface universality class of
the three-dimensional O($N$) model, bounded by a two-dimensional surface. Using
high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where the
leading bulk scaling correction is suppressed, and finite-size scaling analysis
of the fourth cumulant of the surface magnetization, we obtain precise
estimates of the scaling dimension of the surface field operator for $N=2,3,4$.
We also determine the fixed-point values of two Renormalization-group invariant
observables, which characterize the finite-size scaling behavior at the
ordinary transition.

<h3>Universal distributions of magnetization transfer in integrable spin  chains</h3>

<br>
<i>Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski, Tomaž Prosen</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies have found that fluctuations of magnetization transfer in
integrable spin chains violate the central limit property. Here we revisit the
problem of anomalous counting statistics in the Landau--Lifshitz field theory
by specializing to two distinct anomalous regimes featuring dynamical
criticality. By performing optimized numerical simulations using an integrable
space-time discretization we extract the algebraic growth exponents of
time-dependent cumulants. The distinctly non-Gaussian statistics of
magnetization transfer in the easy-axis regime is found to converge towards the
universal distribution of charged single-file systems. At the critical
isotropic point we instead infer a weakly non-Gaussian distribution, indicating
that superdiffusive spin transport found in integrable spin chains does not
belong to any known dynamical universality class.

We study fluctuating field models with spontaneously emerging dynamical
phases. We consider two typical transition scenarios, oscillatory instabilities
and exceptional-point transitions associated with parity-time symmetry
breaking. An analytical investigation of the low-noise limit reveals an
unbounded increase of the mesoscopic entropy production rate towards the
transition. For an illustrative model of two nonreciprocally coupled
Cahn-Hilliard fields, we find physical interpretations in terms of fluctuating
active interface dynamics and a coupling of modes near the exceptional point.

We propose an one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH) model
with off-diagonal hopping and staggered on-site potential. We find that the
localization transitions could be multiple reentrant with the increasing of
staggered on-site potential. The multiple localization transitions are verified
by the quantum static and dynamic measurements such as the inversed or
normalized participation ratios, fractal dimension and survival probability.
Based on the finite-size scaling analysis, we also obtain an interesting
intermediate phase where the extended, localized and critical states are
coexistent in certain regime of model parameters. These results are quite
different from those in the generalized AAH model with off-diagonal hopping,
and can help us to find novel quantum phases, new localization phenomena in the
disordered systems.

<h3>Dimensional reduction of the Luttinger-Ward functional for  spin-degenerate $D$-dimensional electron gases</h3>

<br>
<i>D. Miserev, J. Klinovaja, D. Loss</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider an isotropic spin-degenerate interacting uniform $D$-dimensional
electron gas (DDEG) with $D > 1$ within the Luttinger-Ward (LW) formalism. We
derive the asymptotically exact semiclassical/infrared limit of the LW
functional at large distances, $r \gg \lambda_F$, and large times, $\tau \gg
1/E_F$, where $\lambda_F$ and $E_F$ are the Fermi wavelength and the Fermi
energy, respectively. The LW functional is represented by skeleton diagrams,
each skeleton diagram consists of appropriately connected dressed fermion
loops. First, we prove that every $D$-dimensional skeleton diagram consisting
of a single fermion loop is reduced to a one-dimensional (1D) fermion loop with
the same diagrammatic structure, which justifies the name dimensional
reduction. This statement, combined with the fermion loop cancellation theorem
(FLCT), agrees with results of multidimensional bosonization. Here we show that
the backscattering and the spectral curvature, both explicitly violate the FLCT
and both are irrelevant for a 1DEG, become relevant at $D > 1$ and $D > 2$,
respectively. The reason for this is a strong infrared divergence of the
skeleton diagrams containing multiple fermion loops at $D > 1$. These diagrams,
which are omitted within the multidimensional bosonization approaches, account
for the non-collinear scattering processes. Thus, the dimensional reduction
provides the framework to go beyond predictions of the multidimensional
bosonization. A simple diagrammatic structure of the reduced LW functional is
another advantage of our approach. The dimensional reduction technique is also
applicable to the thermodynamic potential and various approximations, from
perturbation theory to self-consistent approaches.

Recently, the claim of room-temperature superconductivity in nitrogen-doped
lutetium hydride at near-ambient conditions has attracted tremendous attention.
Criticism of the work rises shortly, while further explorations are needed to
settle the dispute. One of the intriguing observations is the pressured-induced
color change, which has been reproduced in the lutetium dihydride LuH2 while
its mechanism remains unclear. Through optical reflectivity measurements of
LuH2 in the visible to near-infrared region, we observe strong light absorption
next to the sharp plasmon resonance, which continuously shifts to higher
energies with increasing pressure. It gives rise to the increased reflection of
red light and suppressed reflection of blue light. Our work sheds light on
resolving the puzzles regarding the pressure induced color change in LuH2.

Structural or crystal asymmetry are necessary conditions for emergence of
zero-bias photocurrent in light detectors. Structural asymmetry has been
typically achieved via $p-n$ doping being a technologically complex process.
Here, we propose an alternative approach to achieve zero-bias photocurrent in
2d material flakes exploiting the geometrical non-equivalence of source and
drain contacts. As a prototypical example, we equip a square-shaped flake of
PdSe$_2$ with mutually orthogonal metal leads. Upon uniform illumination with
linearly-polarized light, the device demonstrates non-zero photocurrent which
flips its sign upon 90$^\circ$ polarization rotation. The origin of zero-bias
photocurrent lies in polarization-dependent lightning-rod effect. It enhances
the electromagnetic field at one contact from the orthogonal pair, and
selectively activates the internal photoeffect at the respective metal-PdSe$_2$

Supercritical region is often described as uniform with no definite
transitions. The distinct behaviors of the matter therein, e.g., as liquid-like
and gas-like, however, indicate their should-be different belongings. Here, we
provide a mathematical description of these phenomena by revisiting the
Lee-Yang (LY) theory and using a complex phase diagram, e.g. a 4-D one with
complex $T$ and $p$. Beyond the critical point, the 2-D phase diagram with real
$T$ and $p$, i.e. the physical plane, is free of LY zeros and hence no
criticality emerges. But off-plane zeros in this 4-D scenario still come into
play by inducing critical anomalies for different physical properties. This is
evidenced by the correlation between the Widom lines and LY edges in van der
Waals model and water. The present distinct criteria to distinguish the
supercritical matter manifest the high-dimensional feature of the phase
diagram: e.g. when the LY zeros of complex $T$ or $p$ are projected onto the
physical plane, a boundary defined by isobaric heat capacity $C_p$ or adiabatic
compression coefficient $K_T$ emanates. These results demonstrate the incipient
phase transition nature of the supercritical matter.

The even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) in half-filled
Landau levels are generally believed to host non-Abelian quasiparticles and be
of potential use in topological quantum computing. Of particular interest is
the competition and interplay between the even-denominator FQHSs and other
ground states, such as anisotropic phases and composite fermion Fermi seas.
Here we report the observation of an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall
state with highly-anisotropic in-plane transport coefficients at Landau level
filling factor $\nu=3/2$. We observe this state in an ultra-high-quality GaAs
two-dimensional hole system when a large in-plane magnetic field is applied. By
increasing the in-plane field, we observe a sharp transition from an isotropic
composite fermion Fermi sea to an anisotropic even-denominator FQHS. Our data
and calculations suggest that a unique feature of two-dimensional holes, namely
the coupling between heavy-hole and light-hole states, combines different
orbital components in the wavefunction of one Landau level, and leads to the
emergence of a highly-anisotropic even-denominator fractional quantum Hall
state. Our results demonstrate that the GaAs two-dimensional hole system is a
unique platform for the exploration of exotic, many-body ground states.

Feedback control uses the state information of the system to actuate on it.
The information used implies an effective entropy reduction of the controlled
system, potentially increasing its performance. How to compute this entropy
reduction has been formally shown for a general system, and has been explicitly
computed for spatially discrete systems. Here, we address a relevant example of
how to compute the entropy reduction by information in a spatially continuous
feedback-controlled system. Specifically, we consider a feedback flashing
ratchet, which constitutes a paradigmatic example for the role of information
and feedback in the dynamics and thermodynamics of transport induced by the
rectification of Brownian motion. A Brownian particle moves in a periodic
potential that is switched on and off by a controller, with the latter
performing the switching depending on the system state. We show how the entropy
reduction can be computed from the entropy of a sequence of control actions,
and also discuss the required sampling effort for its accurate computation.
Moreover, the output power developed by the particle against an external force
is investigated, which -- for some values of the system parameters -- is shown
to become larger than the input power due to the switching of the potential:
the apparent efficiency of the ratchet thus becomes higher than one, if the
entropy reduction contribution is not considered. This result highlights the
relevance of including the entropy reduction by information in the
thermodynamic balance of feedback controlled devices, specifically when writing
the second principle: the inclusion of the entropy reduction by information
leads to a well-behaved efficiency over all the range of parameters
investigated.

Tremendous progress in few-qubit quantum processing has been achieved lately
using superconducting resonators coupled to gate voltage defined quantum dots.
While the strong coupling regime has been demonstrated recently for odd charge
parity flopping mode spin qubits, first attempts towards coupling a resonator
to even charge parity singlet-triplet spin qubits have resulted only in weak
spin-photon coupling strengths. Here, we integrate a zincblende InAs nanowire
double quantum dot with strong spin-orbit interaction in a magnetic-field
resilient, high-quality resonator. In contrast to conventional strategies, the
quantum confinement is achieved using deterministically grown wurtzite tunnel
barriers without resorting to electrical gating. Our experiments on even charge
parity states and at large magnetic fields, allow us to identify the relevant
spin states and to measure the spin decoherence rates and spin-photon coupling
strengths. Most importantly, at a specific magnetic field, we find an
anti-crossing between the resonator mode in the single photon limit and a
singlet-triplet qubit with an electron spin-photon coupling strength of $g =
114 \pm 9$ MHz, reaching the strong coupling regime in which the coherent
coupling exceeds the combined qubit and resonator linewidth.

Stable ultracold ensembles of dipolar molecules hold great promise for
many-body quantum physics, but high inelastic loss rates have been a
long-standing challenge. Recently, it was shown that gases of fermionic
molecules can be effectively stabilized through external fields. However, many
quantum applications will benefit from molecular ensembles with bosonic
statistics. Here, we stabilize a bosonic gas of strongly dipolar NaCs molecules
against inelastic losses via microwave shielding, decreasing losses by more
than a factor of 200 and reaching lifetimes on the scale of 1 second. We also
measure high elastic scattering rates, a result of strong dipolar interactions,
and observe the anisotropic nature of dipolar collisions. Finally, we
demonstrate evaporative cooling of a bosonic molecular gas to a temperature of
36(5) nK, increasing its phase-space density by a factor of 20. This work is a
critical step towards the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of dipolar
molecules.

<h3>On the origin and elimination of cross coupling between tunneling  current and excitation in scanning probe experiments that utilize the qPlus  sensor</h3>

The qPlus sensor allows simultaneous measurements of scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Its design for use in
frequency modulation AFM (FM-AFM) involves separate electrodes, applied on an
oscillating quartz cantilever, for the detection of an electronic tunneling
current and the deflection signal. Cable resistance and capacities in the
electronic setup can induce cross talk phenomena. We report a tunneling
current-induced cross coupling observed in a combined STM/AFM setup which uses
the qPlus sensor. This cross coupling can induce a positive or negative change
of the amplitude excitation signal, thus acting as an apparent dissipation or
drive. The experimental data is explained well by tunneling current-induced
fluctuations of the electric potential on the sensor electrodes.

<h3>Many-body localization proximity effect in two-species bosonic Hubbard  model</h3>

The many-body localization (MBL) proximity effect is an intriguing phenomenon
where a thermal bath localizes due to the interaction with a disordered system.
The interplay of thermal and non-ergodic behavior in these systems gives rise
to a rich phase diagram, whose exploration is an active field of research. In
this work, we study a bosonic Hubbard model featuring two particle species
representing the bath and the disordered system. Using state of the art
numerical techniques, we investigate the dynamics of the model in different
regimes, based on which we obtain a tentative phase diagram as a function of
coupling strength and bath size. When the bath is composed of a single
particle, we observe clear signatures of a transition from an MBL proximity
effect to a delocalized phase. Increasing the bath size, however, its
thermalizing effect becomes stronger and eventually the whole system
delocalizes in the range of moderate interaction strengths studied. In this
regime, we characterize particle transport, revealing diffusive behavior of the
originally localized bosons.

<h3>The Hidden-Manifold Hopfield Model and a learning phase transition</h3>

The Hopfield model has a long-standing tradition in statistical physics,
being one of the few neural networks for which a theory is available. Extending
the theory of Hopfield models for correlated data could help understand the
success of deep neural networks, for instance describing how they extract
features from data. Motivated by this, we propose and investigate a generalized
Hopfield model that we name Hidden-Manifold Hopfield Model: we generate the
couplings from $P=\alpha N$ examples with the Hebb rule using a non-linear
transformation of $D=\alpha_D N$ random vectors that we call factors, with $N$
the number of neurons. Using the replica method, we obtain a phase diagram for
the model that shows a phase transition where the factors hidden in the
examples become attractors of the dynamics; this phase exists above a critical
value of $\alpha$ and below a critical value of $\alpha_D$. We call this
behaviour learning transition.

Hybrid structures between conventional, s-wave superconductors and
two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs) are a promising route to
topological superconductivity. Here, we investigate planar Josephson junctions
fabricated from hybrid structures that use thin films of cadmium arsenide
(Cd3As2) as the 2D TI material. Measurements of superconducting interference
patterns in a perpendicular magnetic field are used to extract information
about the spatial distribution of the supercurrent. We show that the
interference patterns are distinctly different in junctions with and without
mesa-isolation, respectively. In mesa-defined junctions, the bulk of the 2D TI
appears to be almost completely shunted by supercurrent flowing along the
edges, while the supercurrent is much more uniform across the junction when the
Cd3As2 film extends beyond the device. We discuss the possible origins of the
observed behaviors.

<h3>Maximum entropy analytic continuation of anomalous self-energies</h3>

The anomalous self-energy plays an important role in the analysis of
superconducting states. Its spectral weight provides information on the pairing
glue of superconductors, but it can change in sign. In many numerical
approaches, for example Monte Carlo methods based on the Nambu formalism, the
anomalous self-energy is obtained on the Matsubara axis, and nonpositive
spectral weight cannot be directly obtained using the standard maximum entropy
analytic continuation method. Here, we introduce an auxiliary self-energy
corresponding to a linear combination of the normal and anomalous
self-energies. We analytically and numerically prove that this auxiliary
function has non-negative spectral weight independent of the pairing symmetry,
which allows to compute the sign-changing spectrum of the original self-energy
using the maximum entropy approach. As an application, we calculate the
momentum-resolved spectral function of K$_3$C$_{60}$ in the superconducting
state.
