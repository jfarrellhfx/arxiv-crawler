<h3>Machian fractons, Hamiltonian attractors and non-equilibrium steady  states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02271</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishodh Prakash, Ylias Sadki, S.L. Sondhi</i>
<p>We study the $N$ fracton problem in classical mechanics, with fractons
defined as point particles that conserve multipole moments up to a given order.
We find that the nonlinear Machian dynamics of the fractons is characterized by
late-time attractors in position-velocity space for all $N$, despite the
absence of attractors in phase space dictated by Liouville's theorem. These
attractors violate ergodicity and lead to non-equilibrium steady states, which
always break translational symmetry, even in spatial dimensions where the
Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem for equilibrium systems forbids such
breaking. While a full understanding of the many-body nonlinear problem is a
formidable and incomplete task, we provide a conceptual understanding of our
results using an adiabatic approximation for the late-time trajectories and an
analogy with the idea of `order-by-disorder' borrowed from equilibrium
statistical mechanics. Altogether, these fracton systems host a new paradigm
for Hamiltonian dynamics and non-equilibrium many-body physics.

<h3>Influence of Matrix Composition on Microstructural Yielding and Vickers  Hardness in Phase Separated Glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02293" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02293</a>

<i>Nicholas L. Clark, Shih-Yi Chuang, John C. Mauro</i>
<p>The relationship between matrix phase composition and microstructure yielding
in phase separated calcium aluminosilicate glasses is investigated. Varying the
treatment temperature of a phase separated glass results in glasses with
different microstructures and matrix compositions. The impact of matrix
composition on hardness depends on the mode of microstructural deformation. In
glasses that deform via the droplet-densification mechanism, decreasing the
matrix silica content results in a decrease in hardness due to the weakest-link
effect and greater amounts of incongruent yielding of the phases. This
relationship may act as an additional source of the indentation size effect in
phase separated glasses. In glasses that deform via droplet-coalescence,
decreasing the matrix silica content results in increasing hardness due to
increased coalescence of the droplet phase during yielding.

<h3>Improved Performance of Organic Light-Emitting Transistors Enabled by  Polyurethane Gate Dielectric</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02302</a>

<p>Organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs) are multifunctional optoelectronic
devices that combine in a single structure the advantages of organic light
emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). However,
low charge mobility and high threshold voltage are critical hurdles to
practical OLETs implementation. This work reports on the improvements obtained
by using polyurethane films as dielectric layer material in place of the
standard poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) in OLET devices. It was found that
polyurethane drastically reduces the number of traps in the device thereby
improving electrical and optoelectronic device parameters. In addition, a model
was developed to rationalize an anomalous behavior at the pinch-off voltage.
Our findings represent a step forward to overcome the limiting factors of OLETs
that prevent their use in commercial electronics by providing a simple route
for low-bias device operation.

<h3>Hydrogen induces chiral conduction channels in the topological magnet</h3>

<p>Chirality, a characteristic handedness that distinguishes 'left' from
'right', cuts widely across all of nature$^1$, from the structure of DNA$^2$ to
opposite chirality of particles and antiparticles$^3$. In condensed matter
chiral fermions have been identified in Weyl semimetals$^4$ through their
unconventional electrodynamics arising from 'axial' charge imbalance between
chiral Weyl nodes of topologically nontrivial electronic bands. Up to now it
has been challenging or impossible to create transport channels of Weyl
fermions in a single material that could be easily configured for advancing
chiral logic or spintronics$^{5,6}$. Here we generate chirality-directed
conduction channels in inversion-symmetric Weyl ferromagnet (FM) $MnSb_2Te_4$,
emergent from a deep connection between chirality in reciprocal and real space.
We alter the bandstructure on-demand with an intake and a subsequent release of
ionic hydrogen ($H^+$) $-$ a process we show to induce the tilt and rotation of
Weyl bands. The transformed Weyl FM states feature a doubled Curie temperature
$\geq50K$ and an enhanced angular transport chirality synchronous with a rare
field-antisymmetric longitudinal resistance $-$ a low-field tunable 'chiral
switch' that roots in the interplay of Berry curvature$^7$, chiral anomaly$^8$
and hydrogen-engendered mutation of Weyl nodes.

<h3>Engineering a High Spin Chern-Number Insulator in Epitaxial Sb Monolayer</h3>

<p>High spin Chern-number insulator (HSCI) emerges as a novel 2D topological
phase of condensed matter that is beyond the classification scheme of
topological quantum chemistry. In this work, we report the observation of a
semimetallic Sb monolayer with the same band topology as HSCI. Our
first-principles calculations further indicate a moderate lattice strain can
make Sb monolayer an insulator while retaining the nontrivial topological
order. A quantized spin Hall conductivity is found in the HSCI phase of Sb
monolayer. The results suggest strained Sb monolayer as a promising platform
for exploring intriguing physical properties of the exotic HSCI topological
matter

<h3>Reorganization energy from charge transport measurements in a  monolithically$-$integrated molecular device</h3>

<p>Intermolecular charge transfer reactions are key processes in physical
chemistry. The electron-transfer rates depend on a few system's parameters,
such as temperature, electromagnetic field, distance between adsorbates and,
especially, the molecular reorganization energy. This microscopic greatness is
the energetic cost to rearrange each single$-$molecule and its surrounding
environment when a charge is transferred. Reorganization energies are measured
by electrochemistry and spectroscopy techniques as well as at the
single-molecule limit using atomic force microscopy approaches, but not from
temperature$-$dependent charge transport measurements nor in a
monolithically$-$integrated molecular device. Nowadays self$-$rolling
nanomembrane (rNM) devices, with strain$-$engineered mechanical properties,
on$-$a$-$chip monolithic integration, and operable in distinct environments,
overcome those challenges. Here, we investigate the charge transfer reactions
occurring within a ca. 6 nm thick copper$-$phthalocyanine (CuPc) film employed
as electrode-spacer in a monolithically integrated nanocapacitor. Employing the
rNM technology allows us to measure the molecules' charge$-$transport
dependence on temperature for different electric fields. Thereby, the CuPc
reorganization energy is determined as (930 $\pm$ 40) meV, whereas density
functional theory (DFT) calculations support our findings with the atomistic
picture of the CuPc charge transfer reaction. Our approach presents a
consistent route towards electron transfer reaction characterization using
current$-$voltage spectroscopy and provides insight into the role of the
molecular reorganization energy when it comes to electrochemical nanodevices.

<h3>A Minimal Model for Carnot Efficiency at Maximum Power</h3>

<i>Shiling Liang, Yu-Han Ma, Daniel Maria Busiello, Paolo De Los Rios</i>
<p>Carnot efficiency sets a fundamental upper bound on the heat engine
efficiency, attainable in the quasi-static limit, albeit at the cost of
completely sacrificing power output. In this Letter, we present a minimal heat
engine model that can attain Carnot efficiency while achieving maximum power
output. We unveil the potential of intrinsic divergent physical quantities
within the working substance, such as degeneracy, as promising thermodynamic
resources to break through the universal power-efficiency trade-off imposed by
nonequilibrium thermodynamics for conventional heat engines. Our findings
provide novel insights into the collective advantage in harnessing energy of
many-body interacting systems.

<h3>Role of shape in particle-lipid membrane interactions: from surfing to  full engulfment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02335</a>
<br>
<i>Stijn van der Ham, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Hanumantha Rao Vutukuri</i>
<p>Understanding and manipulating the interactions between foreign bodies and
cell membranes during endo- and phagocytosis is of paramount importance, not
only for the fate of living cells but also for numerous biomedical
applications. This study aims to elucidate the role of variables such as
anisotropic particle shape, curvature, orientation, membrane tension, and
adhesive strength in this essential process, using a minimal experimental
biomimetic system comprising giant unilamellar vesicles and rod-like particles
with different curvatures and aspect ratios. We find that the particle wrapping
process is dictated by the balance between the elastic energy penalty and
adhesion energy gain, leading to two distinct engulfment pathways, tip-first
and side-first, emphasizing the significance of the particle orientation in
determining the pathway. Moreover, our experimental results are consistent with
theoretical predictions in a state diagram, showcasing how to control the
wrapping pathway from surfing to partial to complete wrapping by the interplay
between membrane tension and adhesive strength. At moderate particle
concentrations, we observed the formation of rod clusters, which exhibited
cooperative and sequential wrapping. Our study not only contributes to a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of endocytosis by
highlighting how the interplay between the anisotropic particle shape,
curvature, orientation, membrane tension, and adhesive strength can influence
the engulfment pathway but also provides a foundational base for future
research in the field.

<h3>Insights to Molecular and Bulk Mechanical Properties of Glassy Carbon  Through Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Mechanical Tensile Testing</h3>

<p>With increasing interest in the use of glassy carbon (GC) for a wide variety
of application areas, the need for developing fundamental understanding of its
mechanical properties has come to the forefront. Further, recent theoretical
and modeling works that shed some light on the synthesis of GC through the
process of pyrolysis of polymer precursors have highlighted the possibilities
of a revisit to investigation of its mechanical properties at a fundamental
level. While there are isolated reports on the experimental determination of
its elastic modulus, insights into stress-strain behavior of GC material under
tension and compression obtained through simulation, either at molecular level
or for the bulk material is missing. This current study fills the gap at the
molecular level and investigates the mechanical properties of GC using
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which model the atomistic level formation
and breaking of bonds using bond-order based reactive force field formulations.
The molecular model considered for this simulation has a characteristics 3D
cagey structure of 5-, 6-, and 7-membered carbon rings and graphitic domain of
a flat graphene-like structure. The GC molecular model was subjected to loading
under varying strain rates (0.4/ns, 0.6/ns, 1.25/ns, and 2.5/ns) and varying
temperatures (300 - 800 K) in each of the three axes x, y, and z. The
simulation showed that GC molecule has distinct stress-strain curves under
tension and compression. In tension, MD modeling predicted mean elastic modulus
of 5.71 GPa for a single GC molecule with some dependency on strain rates and
temperature, while in compression, the elastic modulus was also found to depend
on the strain rates as well as temperature and was predicted to have a mean
value of 35 GPa

<h3>Time-reversibility during the aging of materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Till Böhmer, Jan P. Gabriel, Jan-Niklas Kociok, Tina Hecksher, Jeppe C. Dyre, Thomas Blochowicz</i>
<p>Physical aging is the generic term for irreversible processes in glassy
materials resulting from molecular rearrangements. We present multi-speckle
dynamic light-scattering data on an aging sample of the molecular glass former
1-phenyl-1-propanol following temperature jumps close to the glass transition,
starting from and ending in thermal equilibrium. It is demonstrated that the
material time of the Tool-Narayanaswamy aging formalism can be determined from
the time-autocorrelation function of the scattered-light intensity
fluctuations. These fluctuations are shown to be stationary and reversible when
regarded as a function of the material time. The glass-forming colloidal
synthetic clay Laponite, as well as a chemically aging curing epoxy, are shown
also to have material-time-reversible scattered-light intensity fluctuations.
Our findings, besides showing direct measurements of the material time,
identify a fundamental property of aging in quite different contexts, which
presents a challenge to the current theories of aging.

<h3>Heat-Bath and Metropolis Dynamics in Ising-like Models on Directed  Regular Random Graphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02398" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02398</a>
<br>
<i>Adam Lipowski, Antonio L. Ferreira, Dorota Lipowska</i>
<p>Using a single-site mean-field approximation (MFA) and Monte Carlo
simulations, we examine Ising-like models on directed regular random graphs.
The models are directed-network implementations of the Ising model, Ising model
with absorbing states, and majority voter models. When these nonequilibrium
models are driven by the heat-bath dynamics, their stationary characteristics,
such as magnetization, are correctly reproduced by MFA as confirmed by Monte
Carlo simulations. It turns out that MFA reproduces the same result as the
generating functional analysis that is expected to provide the exact
description of such models. We argue that on directed regular random graphs,
the neighbors of a given vertex are typically uncorrelated, and that is why MFA
for models with heat-bath dynamics provides their exact description. For models
with Metropolis dynamics, certain additional correlations become relevant, and
MFA, which neglects these correlations, is less accurate. Models with heat-bath
dynamics undergo continuous phase transition, and at the critical point, the
power-law time decay of the order parameter exhibits the behavior of the Ising
mean-field universality class. Analogous phase transitions for models with
Metropolis dynamics are discontinuous.

<h3>Comparison of Linear Viscoelastic Behaviors of Langevin- and Jump-Rouse  Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02402</a>
<br>
<i>Takashi Uneyama</i>
<p>The Rouse model with harmonic springs and the Langevin equation
(Langevin-Rouse model) is widely used to describe the linear viscoelasticity of
unentangled polymer melts. A similar model, in which the Langevin equation is
replaced by discrete local jump dynamics (the jump-Rouse model), is also used
to describe the dynamics of some systems such as entangled polymer melts.
Intuitively, we expect that the Langevin- and jump-Rouse models give similar
linear viscoelastic behaviors. However, the Langevin- and jump-Rouse models are
not equivalent, and their linear viscoelastic behaviors can be different. In
this work, we compare the shear relaxation moduli of the Langevin- and
jump-Rouse model in detail. We develop a jump rate model in which the
resampling ratio is tunable. By using this jump rate model, we can smoothly
connect the jump-Rouse model and the Langevin-Rouse model. We perform kinetic
Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the shear relaxation modulus data of the
jump-Rouse model. We compare the simulation results with various numbers of
beads and resampling ratios, and show that the shear relaxation moduli of the
Langevin- and jump-Rouse models are similar but slightly different. We analyze
the short-time relaxation behavior of the jump-Rouse model, and show that the
local jumps give a single Maxwell type relaxation in the short-time region.

<h3>Classification of Multi-Orbital Superconducting State based on Augmented  Multipoles</h3>

<br>
<i>Akimitsu Kirikoshi, Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>The pairing interactions between electrons play an essential role in
determining the properties in superconducting states. Recently, a plethora of
unconventional superconducting states has been extensively explored, which
often emerge owing to multipole fluctuations in the vicinity of multipole
orders. We classify such superconducting states from the viewpoint of the
multipole degrees of freedom by extending its representation to Nambu space. We
clarify that arbitrary Cooper pairs between electrons with any angular momenta
are systematically classified by four types of multipoles, electric, magnetic,
magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles, under the crystallographic
point group. As examples, we apply our formulation to an $sp$-orbital electron
system, which potentially exhibits exotic Cooper pairs under polar and axial
point groups. Our systematic classification will be useful in characterizing
unconventional superconducting states in multi-orbital systems.

<h3>Universal Symmetry Constraints on Spin Polarization in  Non-centrosymmetric Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02425</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Tan, Jianfeng Wang, Yang Li, Bing Huang</i>
<p>The current understanding of spin-polarization phenomena in crystals relying
on the crystalline symmetries is far from complete. Here, we develop a
universal theory, consisting of five basic symmetry-constrained rules, to
capture the diverse spin textures (STs) in non-centrosymmetric crystals, via
exhaustively classifying the crystalline symmetry operations and their
combinations with time-reversal operation in symmetry-preserved k-invariant
subspace. Our theory is verified by extensive material examples based on the
first-principles calculations, explaining their kaleidoscopic STs or even
vanishing spin-polarization effect. Interestingly, based on our theory, we
argue that the generally accepted radial STs in chiral crystals cannot be
rigorous. More importantly, combining with topological band theory, we propose
the symmetry-constrained three-dimensional persistent STs, which is long sought
but never be discovered, could be abundant in two families of nonsymmorphic
crystals. Our theory could broaden our understanding of spin-polarization
effect and enable the dream of ab initio design of desirable STs in crystals.

<h3>Magnetic instability under ferroaxial moment</h3>

<br>
<i>Akane Inda, Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>Magnetic anisotropy is one of the important factors in determining magnetic
structures. A type of magnetic anisotropy is closely related to the symmetry of
crystals. We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy and its related
magnetic instability arising from an electric axial moment, which appears under
the breaking of the mirror symmetry parallel to the moment but does not require
the breakings of both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. By
performing perturbation and mean-field calculations in a complementary way, we
show the appearance of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy when the electric axial
moment occurs, which tends to tilt in-plane spin moments from the crystal axes
in collaboration with relativistic spin--orbit coupling. We demonstrate such a
tendency for single-site and four-site cluster models, the latter of which
leads to the instability toward a spin vortex phase accompanying magnetic
monopole and magnetic toroidal dipole.

<h3>Electrical control and transport of tightly bound interlayer excitons in  a MoSe2/hBN/MoSe2 heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02446" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02446</a>
<br>
<i>Lifu Zhang, Ruihao Ni, Liuxin Gu, Ming Xie, Suji Park, Houk Jang, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, You Zhou</i>
<p>Controlling interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures holds
promise for exploring Bose-Einstein condensates and developing novel
optoelectronic applications, such as excitonic integrated circuits. Despite
intensive studies, several key fundamental properties of interlayer excitons,
such as their binding energies and interactions with charges, remain not well
understood. Here we report the formation of momentum-direct interlayer excitons
in a high-quality MoSe2/hBN/MoSe2 heterostructure under an electric field,
characterized by bright photoluminescence (PL) emission with high quantum yield
and a narrow linewidth of less than 4 meV. These interlayer excitons show
electrically tunable emission energy spanning ~180 meV through the Stark
effect, and exhibit a sizable binding energy of ~81 meV in the intrinsic
regime, along with trion binding energies of a few millielectronvolts.
Remarkably, we demonstrate the long-range transport of interlayer excitons with
a characteristic diffusion length exceeding ten micrometers, which can be
attributed, in part, to their dipolar repulsive interactions. Spatially and
polarization-resolved spectroscopic studies reveal rich exciton physics in the
system, such as valley polarization, local trapping, and the possible existence
of dark interlayer excitons. The formation and transport of tightly bound
interlayer excitons with narrow linewidth, coupled with the ability to
electrically manipulate their properties, open exciting new avenues for
exploring quantum many-body physics, including excitonic condensate and
superfluidity, and for developing novel optoelectronic devices, such as exciton
and photon routers.

<h3>Arbitrary interaction quench phenomena in harmonically trapped two-body  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02452" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02452</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Kerin, Andy Martin</i>
<p>We consider the evolution of two contact-interacting harmonically-trapped
particles following an arbitrary quench in interaction strength. We calculate
the post-quench particle separation as a function of time and the total
post-quench energy. When quenching from any non-zero interaction strength to
zero interaction strength we observe that the total energy and particle
separation diverge. In particular, the divergent behaviour arises always and
exclusively when quenching to the non-interacting regime. The source of the
divergence is a power-law tail in the probability distribution of particle
separation. This validates and builds upon previous work that found divergent
behaviour arises when quenching from the strongly interacting limit to the
non-interacting limit in both the two and three-body cases.

<h3>An adaptive preconditioning scheme for the self-consistent field  iteration and generalized stacking-fault energy calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02459</a>
<br>
<i>Sitong Zhang, Xingyu Gao, Haifeng Song, Bin Wen</i>
<p>The generalized stacking-fault energy (GSFE) is the fundamental but key
parameter for the plastic deformation of materials. We perform first-principles
calculations by full-potential linearized augmented planewave (FLAPW) method to
evaluate the GSFE based on the single-shift and triple-shift supercell models.
Different degrees of defects are introduced in the two models, thereby
affecting the convergence of the self-consistent field (SCF) iterations. We
present an adaptive preconditioning scheme which can identify the
long-wavelength divergence behavior of the Jacobian during the SCF iteration
and automatically switch on the Kerker preconditioning to accelerate the
convergence. We implement this algorithm in Elk-7.2.42 package and calculate
the GSFE curves for Al, Cu, and Si (111) plane <-1-12> direction. We found that
the single-shift and triple-shift supercell models have equivalent calculation
accuracy and are within the experimental data uncertainty. For computational
efficiency, the triple-shift supercell model is preferable due to its better
convergence, exhibiting lower degree of defect compared to the single-shift
supercell model.

<h3>Pairwise annihilation of Weyl nodes by magnetic fields in the Hofstadter  regime</h3>

<br>
<i>Faruk Abdulla</i>
<p>Weyl semimetal, which does not require any symmetry except translation for
protection, is a robust gapless state of quantum matters in three dimensions.
When translation symmetry is preserved, the only way to destroy a Weyl
semimetal state is to bring two Weyl nodes of opposite chirality close to each
other to annihilate pairwise. An external magnetic field can destroy a pair of
Weyl nodes (which are separated by a momentum space distance $2k_0$) of
opposite chirality, when the magnetic length $l_B$ becomes close to or smaller
than the inverse separation $1/2k_0$. In this work, we investigate pairwise
annihilation of Weyl nodes by external magnetic field which ranges all the way
from small to a very large value in the Hofstadter regime $l_B \sim a$. We show
that this pairwise annihilation in a WSM featuring two Weyl nodes leads to the
emergence of either a normal insulator or a layered Chern insulator. In the
case of a Weyl semimetal with multiple Weyl nodes, the potential for generating
a variety of states through external magnetic fields emerges. Our study
introduces a straightforward and intuitive representation of the pairwise
annihilation process induced by magnetic fields, enabling accurate predictions
of the phases that may appear after pairwise annihilation of Weyl nodes.

<h3>Laser induced Flqouet topological phases in a 2D weak topological  insulator with unconventional nonlinear dispersion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02474" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02474</a>
<br>
<i>Aayushi Agrawal, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay</i>
<p>Recently, we presented a two-dimensional (2D) model of a weak topological
insulator formed by stacking an $N$ number of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains
\cite{Agrawal_2022-02}. We now study the influence of periodic driving on the
topological properties of this system, which has all the fundamental
symmetries, by shining it with circularly polarized light (CPL). The CPL is
chosen because it breaks the time-reversal symmetry, which induces more exotic
topological properties in the system. We investigate two different formations
of the $N$ stacked SSH chains: all the SSH chains are topologically trivial in
one formation and nontrivial in the other one. In contrast to the undriven or
static case, both formations exhibit distinct topological behaviors. Here, we
particularly derive the Floquet or the effective Hamiltonian using the replica
method, which facilitates the study of high- and low-frequency regimes. We have
discovered that this model exhibits laser-induced Floquet topological phases
with higher Chern numbers. This system has nonlinear dispersion along both
directions with additional $k_x-k_y$ coupling terms, which made the dispersion
of this system {\it unconventional}. We closely study the role of this
unconventional dispersion in the system at the low-energy limit and its
response to periodic driving. The low-energy Hamiltonian also reveals a
hierarchy in the gaps of the neighboring Floquet bands. Interestingly, though
this model has nonlinear quasi-energy dispersion, it still shows some
signatures of hierarchy, which was observed in the system with linear
dispersion like graphene. Furthermore, we study the effect of linearly
polarized light (LPL) on the topological properties of the system. In response
to the LPL driving, the band-touching point either opens up or splits into two
band-touching points.

<h3>Accurate Machine Learning Predictions of Coercivity in High-Performance  Permanent Magnets</h3>

<i>Churna Bhandari, Gavin Nop, Jonathan D.H. Smith, Durga Paudyal</i>
<p>Increased demand for high-performance permanent magnets in the electric
vehicle and wind turbine industries has prompted the search for cost-effective
alternatives. Nevertheless, the discovery of new magnetic materials with the
desired intrinsic and extrinsic permanent magnet properties presents a
significant challenge. Traditional density functional theory (DFT) accurately
predicts intrinsic permanent magnet properties such as magnetic moments,
magneto-crystalline anisotropy constants, and exchange interactions. However,
it cannot compute extrinsic macroscopic properties, such as coercivity ($H_c$),
which are influenced by factors like microscopic defects and internal grain
structures. Although micromagnetic simulation helps compute $H_c$, it
overestimates the values almost by an order of magnitude due to Brown's
paradox. To circumvent these limitations, we employ machine learning (ML)
methods in an extensive database obtained from experiments, DFT calculations,
and micromagnetic modeling. Our novel ML approach is computationally much
faster than the micromagnetic simulation program, the mumax$^3$. We
successfully utilize it to predict $H_c$ values for materials like cerium-doped
$\mathrm{Nd}_2\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\mathrm{B}$, and subsequently compare the
predicted values with experimental results. Remarkably, our ML model accurately
identifies uniaxial magnetic anisotropy as the primary contributor to $H_c$.
With DFT calculations, we predict the Nd-site dependent magnetic anisotropy
behavior in $\mathrm{Nd}_2\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\mathrm{B}$, confirming $4f$-site
planar and $4g$-site uniaxial to crystalline $c$-direction in good agreement
with experiment. The Green's function atomic sphere approximation calculated a
Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) for $\mathrm{Nd}_2\mathrm{Fe}_{14}\mathrm{B}$
that also agrees well with experiment.

<i>B. Jordan Russell, Matheus Schossler, Jesse Balgley, Yashika Kapoor, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, Alexander Seidel, Yafis Barlas, Erik A. Henriksen</i>
<p>We perform infrared magneto-spectroscopy of Landau level (LL) transitions in
dual-gated bilayer graphene. At $\nu=4$ when the zeroth LL (octet) is filled,
two resonances are observed indicating the opening of a gap. At $\nu=0$ when
the octet is half-filled, multiple resonances are found to disperse
non-monotonically with increasing displacement field, $D$, perpendicular to the
sheet, showing a phase transition at modest displacement fields to the
layer-polarized state with a gap that opens linearly in $D$. When $D=0$ and
$\nu$ is varied, resonances at $\pm\nu$ show an electron-hole asymmetry with
multiple line splittings as the octet is progressively filled. Broadly these
data show good agreement with predictions from a mean-field Hartree-Fock
calculation, but only by accounting for multiple tight-binding terms in a
four-band model of bilayer graphene that also incorporates valley interaction
anisotropy. Our results are consistent with the presence of a canted
anti-ferromagnet (CAFM) ground state at $\nu=0$, and imply the existence of
intermediate phases in the transition from the CAFM to the layer-polarized
regime.

<p>Ni$_3$In$_2$S$_2$ is the most recent entrant into the family of topological
insulator (TI) materials, the same exhibits very high MR in a low-temperature
regime. Here, we report the crystal growth, the structural, micro-structural,
and magneto-transport study of Ni$_3$In$_2$S$_2$ down to 2.5K under an applied
field of up to 14Tesla. The phase purity and growth direction of a single
crystal is studied by performing XRD on both powder and flake and further
Rietveld analysis is also carried out. The electrical transport measurements
are studied and the grown crystal showed metallic behaviour down to 2.5K, with
an R300K/R2K ratio of around 7. A significant variation in magnetoresistance
(MR) values is observed as the temperature is increased from 2.5K to 200K under
an applied field of up to 14 Tesla. Interestingly the low T (2.5K), MR shows a
clear V-type characteristic TI cusp. Magnetoconductivity data at low fields
(1Tesla) is fitted with the Hikami Larkin Nagaoka (HLN) model, which showed the
presence of a weak anti-localization effect in the synthesized
Ni$_3$In$_2$S$_2$ crystal at low temperatures. We have successfully grown near
single-phase Ni$_3$In$_2$S$_2$ and its TI behavior is demonstrated by
magneto-transport measurements.

<p>Insulating materials featuring ultralow thermal conductivity for diverse
applications also require robust mechanical properties. Conventional thinking,
however, which correlates strong bonding with high atomic-vibration-mediated
heat conduction, led to diverse weakly bonded materials that feature ultralow
thermal conductivity and low elastic moduli. One must, therefore, search for
strongly-bonded materials in which heat transport is impeded by other means.
Here, we report intrinsic, glass-like, ultralow thermal conductivity and
ultrahigh elastic-modulus/thermal-conductivity ratio in single-crystalline,
BaZrS3-derived, Ruddlesden-Popper phases Ban+1ZrnS3n+1, n = 2, 3. Their key
features are strong anharmonicity and intra-unit-cell rock-salt blocks. The
latter produce strongly bonded intrinsic superlattices, impeding heat
conduction by broadband reduction of phonon velocities and mean free paths and
concomitant strong phonon localization. The present study initiates a paradigm
of "mechanically stiff phonon glasses".

<h3>Modulating dichroism and optical conductivity in bilayer graphene under  intense electromagnetic field irradiation</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Sajad Dabiri, Hosein Cheraghchi, Fatemeh Adinehvand, Reza Asgari</i>
<p>This study explores the impact of a strong perpendicular laser field on the
electronic structure and optical conductivity of bilayer graphene. Employing
the Floquet-Bloch theorem and a four-band Hamiltonian model, we calculate the
optical conductivity, unveiling modified optical properties due to the altered
band structure. We investigate the effects of both circularly and linearly
polarized dressing fields on the electronic structure and optical conductivity
in the system. Under linear polarization, we observe a notable anisotropy in
the band dispersion and optical conductivity, resulting in linear dichroism. In
the case of circular polarization, we anticipate the emergence of induced Berry
curvature and circular dichroism, especially close to the dynamical gaps. When
circularly polarized light is applied alongside a bias potential, the band
structure differs for right-handed and left-handed polarization. In this case,
the longitudinal optical conductivity remains the same for both, while the
transversal optical conductivity exhibits distinct results. Furthermore, the
induced Berry curvature and valley asymmetry introduce the potential for
generating a valley-polarized current, enabling valley-selective pumping and
leading to circular dichroism.

<h3>Fragility of the antichiral edge states under disorder</h3>

<i>Marwa Mannaï, Eduardo V. Castro, Sonia Haddad</i>
<p>Chiral edge states are the fingerprint of the bulk-edge correspondence in a
Chern insulator. Co-propagating edge modes, known as antichiral edge states,
have been predicted to occur in the so-called modified Haldane model describing
a two-dimensional semi-metal with broken time reversal symmetry. These
counterintuitive edge modes are argued to be immune to backscattering and
extremely robust against disorder. Here, we investigate the robustness of the
antichiral edge states in the presence of Anderson disorder. By analysing
different localization parameters, we show that, contrary to the general
belief, these edge modes are fragile against disorder, and can be easily
localized. Our work provides insights to improve the transport efficiency in
the burgeoning fields of antichiral topological photonics and acoustics.

<br>
<i>Marco Biroli, Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<p>We study a one dimensional gas of $N$ noninteracting diffusing particles in a
harmonic trap, whose stiffness switches between two values $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$
with constant rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively. Despite the absence of direct
interaction between the particles, we show that strong correlations between
them emerge in the stationary state at long times, induced purely by the
dynamics itself. We compute exactly the joint distribution of the positions of
the particles in the stationary state, which allows us to compute several
physical observables analytically. In particular, we show that the extreme
value statistics (EVS), i.e., the distribution of the position of the rightmost
particle has a nontrivial shape in the large $N$ limit. The scaling function
characterizing this EVS has a finite support with a tunable shape (by varying
the parameters). Remarkably, this scaling function turns out to be universal.
First, it also describes the distribution of the position of the $k$-th
rightmost particle in a $1d$ trap. Moreover, the distribution of the position
of the particle farthest from the center of the harmonic trap in $d$ dimensions
is also described by the same scaling function for all $d \geq 1$. Numerical
simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions.

<h3>Revolutionary valorization of carbon dioxide into dimethyl carbonate is  catalyzed by sodium chloride: cheap, clean, one-pot, and water-free synthesis</h3>

<br>
<i>Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda A. Andreeva, Leonardo Moreira dos Santos, Sandra Einloft</i>
<p>The robust valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2) stays at the center of
sustainable development. Since CO2 represents a low-energy compound, its
transformation into commercially coveted products is cumbersome. In the present
work, we report a revolutionary method to obtain dimethyl carbonate (DMC) out
of methanol (CH3OH) and CO2 catalyzed by sodium chloride (NaCl) and similar
inorganic salts. The computational exploration revealed a mechanism of
favorable catalysis, which was subsequently confirmed experimentally. Unlike
all competitive syntheses of DMC, the new one does not produce water and,
therefore, the hydrolysis of a carbonate does not occur. No dehydrating agents
are necessary. The employed catalyst is cheap and permanently exists in the
same phase with the reactants and products. The action of NaCl was compared to
those of other alkali metal salts, LiI, LiCl, and KI, and competitive
performances were recorded. The experimentally obtained result outperforms most
competing technologies according to the DMC yield, 19% with molecular sieves
and 17% without molecular sieves. All existing competitors are excelled by the
simplicity and cleanness of the synthesis. The reported advance substantially
simplifies the synthesis of linear organic carbonates and robustly valorizes
CO2. Keywords: Dimethyl carbonate; carbon dioxide utilization; sodium chloride;

<h3>Probing defectivity beneath the hydrocarbon blanket in 2D hBN using  TEM-EELS</h3>

<i>Dana O. Byrne, Jim Ciston, Frances I. Allen</i>
<p>The controlled creation and manipulation of defects in 2D materials has
become increasingly popular as a means to design and tune new material
functionalities. However, defect characterization by direct atomic imaging is
often severely limited by surface contamination due to a blanket of
hydrocarbons. Thus, analysis techniques are needed that can characterize atomic
scale defects despite the contamination. In this work we use electron energy
loss spectroscopy to probe beneath the hydrocarbon blanket, characterizing
defect structures in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) based on fine structure
in the boron K-edge. Since this technique is performed in a transmission
electron microscope, imaging can also be used to assess contamination levels
and other factors such as tears in the fragile 2D sheets, which can affect the
spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, by locally probing individual areas,
multiple regions on the same specimen that have undergone different defect
engineering treatments can be investigated for systematic studies at increased
throughput. For 2D hBN samples irradiated with different ions for a range
doses, we find spectral signatures indicative of boron-oxygen bonding that can
be used as a measure of sample defectiveness depending on the ion beam
treatment.

<p>We present numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD) of the $L_{2,3}$ and $M_{2,3}$ edges of Ru in antiferromagnetic RuO$_2$
using a combination of density functional + dynamical mean-field theory and
configuration interaction treatment of Anderson impurity model. We study the
dependence of the dichroic spectra on the orientation of the N\'eel vector and
discuss it in the context of altermagnetism. Approximate equivalence between
the XMCD spectra for geometries with X-rays propagating parallel and
perpendicular to the N\'eel vector is found and shown to be exact in absence of
valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipolar interaction.

<h3>Density-Jump Transitions in the Debye-Hückel Theory of Spin Ice and  Electrolytes</h3>

<br>
<i>Omar J. Abbas, Steven T. Bramwell, Daan M. Arroo</i>
<p>Debye-H\"{u}ckel theory, originally developed to describe dilute electrolyte
solutions, has proved particularly successful as a description of magnetic
monopoles in spin ice systems such as Dy$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$. For this model,
Ryzhkin et al. [JETP Lett. 95, 302-306 (2012)] predicted a phase transition in
which the monopole density abruptly changes by several orders of magnitude but
to date this transition has not been observed experimentally. Here we confirm
that this transition is a robust prediction of Debye-H\"{u}ckel theory, that
does not rely on approximations made in the previous work. However, we also
find that the transition occurs in a regime where the theory breaks downs as a
description of a Coulomb fluid and may be plausibly interpreted as an indicator
of monopole crystallisation. By extending Ryzhkin's model, we associate the
density jump of Debye-H\"uckel theory with the monopole crystallisation
observed in staggered-potential models of `magnetic moment fragmentation', as
well as with crystallisation in conserved monopole-density models. The
possibility of observing a true density-jump transition in real spin ice and
electrolyte systems is discussed.

<p>We demonstrate that the mode number of Andreev bound states in bilayer
graphene Josephson junctions can be modulated by in situ control of the
superconducting coherence length. By exploiting the quadratic band dispersion
of bilayer graphene, we control the Fermi velocity and thus the coherence
length by the application of the electrostatic gating. Tunneling spectroscopy
of Andreev bound states reveals a crossover from short to long Josephson
junction regimes as the gate voltage is approached near the charge neutral
point of bilayer graphene. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of Andreev
spectrums for different mode numbers allows us to quantitatively estimate the
phase-dependent Josephson current. Our work paves a new way to study multi-mode
Andreev levels and to engineer Fermi velocity with bilayer graphene.

<p>Terahertz (THz) light pulses can be used for an ultrafast coherent
manipulation of the magnetization. Driving the magnetization at THz frequencies
is currently the fastest way of writing magnetic information in ferromagnets.
Using time-resolved resonant magnetic scattering, we gain new insights to the
THz-driven coherent magnetization dynamics on nanometer length scales. We
observe ultrafast demagnetization and coherent magnetization oscillations that
are governed by a time-dependent damping. This damping is determined by the
interplay of lattice heating and magnetic anisotropy reduction revealing an
upper speed limit for THz-induced magnetization switching. We show that in the
presence of nanometer-sized magnetic domains, the ultrafast magnetization
oscillations are associated with a correlated beating of the domain walls. The
overall domain structure thereby remains largely unaffected which highlights
the applicability of THz-induced switching on the nanoscale.

<p>Triplet superconductivity arises in systems where the effective electronic
attraction favors Cooper pairs with a symmetric spin structure, as may occur in
non-collinear magnetic systems. Here we show that topological triplet
superconductivity can be realized in a one-dimensional quantum wire through the
interaction with magnetic fluctuations of a helical magnet. The magnon-mediated
attraction favors triplet superconductivity over a large sector of magnetic
parameters, and stabilizes a topological phase with a superconducting gap of
the order of 1 meV over an extended region of chemical potentials.

<p>Understanding the transport behavior of quantum many-body systems constitutes
an important physical endeavor, both experimentally and theoretically. While a
reliable classification into normal and anomalous dynamics is known to be
notoriously difficult for a given microscopic model, even the seemingly simpler
evaluation of transport coefficients in diffusive systems continues to be a
hard task in practice. This fact has motivated the development and application
of various sophisticated methods and is also the main issue of this paper. We
particularly take a barely used strategy, which is based Lanczos coefficients,
and demonstrate that this strategy allows for the accurate calculation of
diffusion coefficients for different paradigmatic examples, including
magnetization transport in nonintegrable spin-1/2 chains and ladders as well as
energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model in one dimension.

<i>A. B. Zavala-Martinez, Eric Grelet</i>
<p>We report on the construction and the dynamics of monodisperse star-shaped
particles, mimicking, at the mesoscale, star polymers. Such multi-arm star-like
particles result from the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles, forming the
core, with tip-linked filamentous viruses - M13 bacteriophages - acting as
spines in a sea urchin-like structure. By combining fluorescence and dark-field
microscopy with dynamic light scattering, we investigate the diffusion of these
hybrid spiny particles. We reveal the internal dynamics of the star particles
by probing their central metallic core, which exhibits a hindered motion that
can be described as a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential. We
therefore show that the filamentous viruses and specifically their tip proteins
behave as entropic springs, extending the relevance of the study of such hybrid
mesoscopic analogs of star polymers to phage biotechnology.

<br>
<i>Chuan-Shuai Huang</i>
<p>Usually the magnetochiral anisotropy related Josephson diode effect is
assumed to be based on conventional two-dimensional electron gas, such as the
InAs quantum well. Here we propose a graphene-based Josephson junction as a
broadly gate-tunable platform for achieving nonreciprocal supercurrent within
the context of magnetochiral anisotropy. We show that the resulting
nonreciprocal supercurrents will exhibit a sign reversal when the graphene
switches from $n$-type doping to $p$-type doping. Particularly, the magnitude
of the nonreciprocity is highly sensitive to the electrostatic doping level of
graphene, enabling gate control of the diode efficiency from zero up to
approximately $40\%$. This giant gate-tunability stems from the chiral nature
of the pseudo-relativistic carriers in grapehe, allowing the graphene Josephson
diode emerges as a promising element for advanced superconducting circuits and
computation devices. Moreover, we have also obtained the so-called $0-\pi$-like
phase transitions in the current-phase relation, in coincidence with recent
experimental finding.

<p>Herein, thermal, dynamical properties, host-guest intermolecular
interactions, and wettability of a series of monohydroxy phenyl-substituted
alcohols (PhAs) infiltrated into native and silanized silica mesopores (d = 4
nm) were investigated by means of Dielectric and Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy,
Differential Scanning Calorimetry as well as the contact angle measurements.
Calorimetric data showed the occurrence of the two glass transition
temperatures, Tg. Importantly, around the one detected at higher temperatures
(Tg interfacial), strong deviation in the temperature evolution of the
relaxation time of the main process was observed for all systems. Moreover, an
additional process unrelated to the mobility of interface layer and core
molecules was revealed most likely connected to either SAP or "new"
confinement-induced nanoassociates. Further, IR investigations showed that the
applied nanoconfinement had little impact on hydrogen bonds' strength, but it
influenced the HBs distribution (including "new" population of HB) and the
degree of association. Additionally, for the first time, we calculated the
activation energy values of the dissociation process for PhAs in mesopores,
which turned out to be lower with respect to those estimated for bulk samples.
Thus, our research clearly showed the impact of the spatial geometrical
restriction on the association process in alcohols having significant steric
hindrance.

<p>Using density functional theory, we carried out systematic calculations for a
series of ultrathin iron layers with thicknesses ranging from one atomic
monolayer to eleven monolayers (up to about 1.5 nm). We considered three cases:
(1) iron layers both on a gold substrate and coated with gold, (2) iron layers
on a gold substrate but without coverage, and (3) freestanding iron layers
adjacent to a vacuum. For our models, we chose initial bcc Fe(001) surfaces and
fcc Au(001) substrates. Based on the calculations, we determined the details of
the geometry and magnetic properties of the systems. We calculate lattice
parameters, magnetic moments, Curie temperatures and magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energies. From the thickness dependence, we determined the volume
and surface contributions to the magnetic anisotropy constant. The further
analysis allowed us to determine the thickness ranges of the occurrence of
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, as well as the effect of thickness and the
presence of a substrate and cap layer on the direction of the magnetization
easy axis.

<br>
<i>Dietmar Paschek, Johanna Busch, Eduard Mock, Ralf Ludwig, Anne Strate</i>
<p>It is the purpose of this paper to present a computational framework for
reliably determining the frequency-dependent intermolecular NMR dipole-dipole
relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from MD simulations. The approach avoids
alterations caused by well-known finite-size effects of the translational
diffusion. Moreover, a procedure is derived to control and correct for effects
caused by fixed distance-sampling cutoffs and periodic boundary conditions. By
construction, this approach is capable of accurately predicting the correct
low-frequency scaling behavior of the intermolecular NMR dipole-dipole
relaxation rate and thus allows the reliable calculation of the
frequency-dependent relaxation rate over many orders of magnitude. Our approach
is based on the utilisation of the theory of Hwang and Freed for the
intermolecular dipole-dipole correlation function and its corresponding
spectral density [J. Chem. Phys. 63, 4017 (1975)] and by its combination with
data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The deviations from the Hwang
and Freed theory caused by periodic boundary conditions and sampling distance
cutoffs are quantified by means of random walker Monte Carlo simulations. An
expression based on the Hwang and Freed theoryis also suggested for correcting
those effects. As a proof of principle, our approach is demonstrated by
computing the frequency-dependent inter- and intramolecular dipolar NMR
relaxation rate of the $^1$H nuclei in liquid water at $273\,\mbox{K}$ and
$298\,\mbox{K}$ based on simulations of the TIP4P/2005 model. Our calculations
are suggesting that the intermolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation
rate of the TIP4P/2005 model in the extreme narrowing limit has previously been
substantially underestimated.

<p>In NiTe$_3$O$_6$ with a chiral crystal structure, we report on a giant
natural optical rotation of the lowest-energy magnon. This polarization
rotation, as large as 140 deg/mm, corresponds to a path difference between
right and left circular polarizations that is comparable to the sample
thickness. Natural optical rotation, being a measure of structural chirality,
is highly unusual for long-wavelength magnons. The collinear antiferromagnetic
order of NiTe$_3$O$_6$ makes this giant effect even more peculiar: Chirality of
the crystal structure does not affect the magnetic ground state but is strongly
manifested in the lowest excited state. We show that the dynamic
magnetoelectric effect, turning this magnon to a magnetic- and electric-dipole
active hybrid mode, generates the giant natural optical rotation. In finite
magnetic fields, it also leads to a strong optical magnetochiral effect.

<p>We study the effect of an AC bias on the low frequency noise, notably
$1/f^\gamma$ with $\gamma<2$, of metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions at room
temperature. The measurement is performed in the 6Hz-100kHz frequency range
with an AC excitation above 1MHz. We observe that $1/f^\gamma$ noise is
dominant across our measurements though the shape of the spectra varies. The
effect of the DC excitation seems to be very different on the noise generated
by the junction than that of the AC excitation, thus questioning the fact that
the observed noise is due to resistance fluctuations that the bias only
reveals.

<h3>Spin-dependent multiple reentrant localization in an antriferromagnetic  helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</a>
<br>
<i>Sudin Ganguly, Kallol Mondal, Santanu K. Maiti</i>
<p>Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally
links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping
dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our
present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in
realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic
ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em
absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the
thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of
Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric
field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional
substitutional disorder. Described within a tight-binding framework, present
work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric
field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry.

<p>Spin waves in magnetic films are affected by the vicinity to a
superconductor. Here we studied a bilayer stack made of an insulating Yttrium
Iron Garnet (YIG) film and a high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting planar resonator.
We studied the hybridization of magnon and photon modes reporting the
temperature evolution of microwave transmission spectra. Data analysis, based
on the description of magnon modes and on the Hopfield model, shows that the
magnon-photon coupling strength and the mode's frequency shift can be
ultimately related to the temperature dependence of the penetration depth of
YBCO.

<p>The work discusses a new low-rank Monte Carlo technique to solve
Smoluchowski-like kinetic equations. It drastically decreases the computational
complexity of modeling of size-polydisperse systems. For the studied systems it
can outperform the existing methods by more than ten times; its superiority
further grows with increasing system size. Application to the recently
developed temperature-dependent Smoluchowski equations is also demonstrated.

<br>
<i>Alexander Osinsky, Nikolay Brilliantov</i>
<p>We derive from the first principles Smoluchowski-Euler equations, describing
aggregation kinetics in space-inhomogeneous systems with fluxes. Starting from
Boltzmann equations, we obtain microscopic expressions for the aggregation
rates for clusters of different size, and observe that they significantly
differ from the currently used phenomenological rates. Moreover, we show that
for a complete description of aggregating systems, novel kinetic coefficients
are needed. These may be called ``flux-reaction'' and ``energy-reaction''
rates, as they appear, respectively, in the equations for fluxes and energy. We
report microscopic expressions for these coefficients. We solve numerically the
Smoluchowski-Euler equations for two representative examples -- aggregation of
particles at sedimentation, and aggregation after an explosion. The solution of
the novel equations is compared with the solution of currently used
phenomenological equations, with phenomenological rate coefficients. We find a
noticeable difference between these solutions, which manifests unreliability of
the phenomenological approach and the need of application of new,
first-principle equations.

<p>The advent of material databases provides an unprecedented opportunity to
uncover predictive descriptors for emergent material properties from vast data
space. However, common reliance on high-throughput ab initio data necessarily
inherits limitations of such data: mismatch with experiments. On the other
hand, experimental decisions are often guided by an expert's intuition honed
from experiences that are rarely articulated. We propose using machine learning
to "bottle" such operational intuition into quantifiable descriptors using
expertly curated measurement-based data. We introduce "Materials
Expert-Artificial Intelligence" (ME-AI) to encapsulate and articulate this
human intuition. As a first step towards such a program, we focus on the
topological semimetal (TSM) among square-net materials as the property inspired
by the expert-identified descriptor based on structural information: the
tolerance factor. We start by curating a dataset encompassing 12 primary
features of 879 square-net materials, using experimental data whenever
possible. We then use Dirichlet-based Gaussian process regression using a
specialized kernel to reveal composite descriptors for square-net topological
semimetals. The ME-AI learned descriptors independently reproduce expert
intuition and expand upon it. Specifically, new descriptors point to
hypervalency as a critical chemical feature predicting TSM within square-net
compounds. Our success with a carefully defined problem points to the "machine
bottling human insight" approach as promising for machine learning-aided
material discovery.

<br>
<i>Chloé Chopin, Simon de Wergifosse, Anatole Moureaux, Flavio Abreu Araujo</i>
<p>Micromagnetic simulations are used to study a spin-torque vortex oscillator
excited by an out-of-plane dc current. The vortex core gyration amplitude is
confined between two orbits due to periodical vortex core polarity reversals.
The upper limit corresponds to the orbit where the vortex core reaches its
critical velocity triggering the first polarity reversal which is immediately
followed by a second one. After this double polarity reversal, the vortex core
is on a smaller orbit that defines the lower limit of the vortex core gyration
amplitude. This double reversal process is a periodic phenomenon and its
frequency as well as the upper and lower limits of the vortex core gyration are
controlled by the input current density while the vortex chirality determines
the onset of this confinement regime. In this non-linear regime, the vortex
core never reaches a stable orbit and thus, it may be of interest for
neuromorphic application, for example as a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron.

<h3>Predicting the morphology of multiphase biomolecular condensates from  protein interaction networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Tianhao Li, William M. Jacobs</i>
<p>Phase-separated biomolecular condensates containing proteins and RNAs can
assemble into higher-order structures by forming thermodynamically stable
interfaces between immiscible phases. Using a minimal model of a protein/RNA
interaction network, we demonstrate how a "shared" protein species that
partitions into both phases of a multiphase condensate can function as a
tunable surfactant that modulates the interfacial properties. We use Monte
Carlo simulations and free-energy calculations to identify conditions under
which a low concentration of this shared species is sufficient to trigger a
wetting transition. We also describe a numerical approach based on classical
density functional theory to predict concentration profiles and surface
tensions directly from the model protein/RNA interaction network. Finally, we
show that the wetting phase diagrams that emerge from our calculations can be
understood in terms of a simple model of selective adsorption to a fluctuating
interface. Our work shows how a low-concentration protein species might
function as a biological switch for regulating multiphase condensate
morphologies.

<h3>Electrical tuning of the magnetic properties of 2D magnets: the case of  ${\rm Cr}_2{\rm Ge}_2{\rm Te}_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02887</a>
<br>
<i>Guido Menichetti, Matteo Calandra, Marco Polini</i>
<p>Motivated by growing interest in atomically-thin van der Waals magnetic
materials, we present an {\it ab initio} theoretical study of the dependence of
their magnetic properties on the electron/hole density $\rho$ induced via the
electrical field effect. By focusing on the case of monolayer ${\rm Cr}_2{\rm
Ge}_2{\rm Te}_6$ (a prototypical 2D Ising ferromagnet) and employing a hybrid
functional, we first study the dependence of the gap and effective mass on the
carrier concentration $\rho$. We then investigate the robustness of magnetism
by studying the dependencies of the exchange couplings and magneto-crystalline
anisotropy energy (MAE) on $\rho$. In agreement with experimental results, we
find that magnetism displays a bipolar electrically-tunable character, which
is, however, much more robust for hole ($\rho>0$) rather than electron
($\rho<0$) doping. Indeed, the MAE vanishes for an electron density
$\rho\approx - 7.5 \times 10^{13}~{\rm e} \times {\rm cm}^{-2}$, signalling the
failure of a localized description based on a Heisenberg-type anisotropic spin
Hamiltonian. This is in agreement with the rapid increase of the coupling
between fourth-neighbor atoms with increasing electron density.

<i>V. P. Mineev</i>
<p>There is developed the strong coupling theory of superconductivity in uranium
compounds based on inter-electron interaction by means magnetic fluctuations.
the magnetic field dependence of electron effective mass is expressed through
the field dependence of components of magnetic susceptibility. It is shown that
the intensity of pairing interaction, hence, the critical temperature of
transition to superconducting state is also determined by the field depending
susceptibility, however, in somewhat different manner than it is in effective
mass. The results are discussed in application to the properties of
ferromagnetic uranium compounds URhGe and UCoGe and to the recently discovered
UTe2.

<i>Fatih Ilgaz, Elizaveta Spetzler, Patrick Wiegand, Franz Faupel, Robert Rieger, Jeffrey McCord, Benjamin Spetzler</i>
<p>Magnetoelastic composites are integral elements of sensors and actuators
utilizing magnetostriction for their functionality. Their sensitivity typically
scales with the saturation magnetostriction and inversely with magnetic
anisotropy. However, this makes the devices prone to minuscule residual
anisotropic stress from the fabrication process, impairing their performance
and reproducibility, hence limiting their suitability for arrays. This study
presents a shadow mask deposition technology combined with a free-free
magnetoelectric microresonator design intended to minimize residual stress and
inhomogeneity in the magnetoelastic layer. Resonators are experimentally and
theoretically analyzed regarding local stress anisotropy, magnetic anisotropy,
and the {\Delta}E effect in several resonance modes. Further, the sensitivity
is analyzed in the example of {\Delta}E-effect sensors. The results demonstrate
a device-to-device variation of the resonance frequency < 0.2 % with
sensitivities comparable with macroscopic {\Delta}E-effect sensors. The
reproducibility is drastically improved over previous magnetoelastic device
arrays. This development marks a step forward in the reproducibility and
homogeneity of magnetoelastic resonators and contributes to the feasibility of
large-scale, integrated sensor arrays.

<h3>Resonant versus non-resonant spin readout of a nitrogen-vacancy center  in diamond under cryogenic conditions</h3>

<i>Richard Monge, Tom Delord, Gergő Thiering, Ádám Gali, Carlos A. Meriles</i>
<p>The last decade has seen an explosive growth in the use of color centers for
metrology applications, the paradigm example arguably being the
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Here, we focus on the regime of
cryogenic temperatures and examine the impact of spin-selective, narrow-band
laser excitation on NV readout. Specifically, we demonstrate a more than
four-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to that possible with
non-resonant (green) illumination, largely due to a boost in readout contrast
and integrated photon count. We also leverage nuclear spin relaxation under
resonant excitation to polarize the 14N host, which we then prove beneficial
for spin magnetometry. These results open opportunities in the application of
NV sensing to the investigation of condensed matter systems, particularly those
exhibiting superconducting, magnetic, or topological phases selectively present
at low temperatures.

<h3>Full Counting Statistics of Charge in Quenched Quantum Gases</h3>

<br>
<i>David X. Horvath, Colin Rylands</i>
<p>Unless constrained by symmetry, measurement of an observable in a quantum
system returns a distribution of values which are encoded in the full counting
statistics. While the mean value of this distribution is important for
determining certain properties of a system, the full distribution can also
exhibit universal behavior. In this paper we study the full counting statistics
of particle number in one dimensional interacting Bose and Fermi gases which
have been quenched far from equilibrium. In particular we consider the time
evolution of the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models quenched from a
Bose-Einstein condensate initial state and calculate the full counting
statistics of the particle number within a subsystem. We show that the scaled
cumulants of the charge in the initial state and at long times are simply
related and in particular the latter are independent of the model parameters.
Using the quasi-particle picture we obtain the full time evolution of the
cumulants and find that although their endpoints are fixed, the finite time
dynamics depends strongly on the model parameters. We go on to construct the
scaled cumulant generating functions and from this determine the limiting
charge probability distributions at long time which are shown to exhibit
distinct non-trivial and non-Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations.

<h3>Quantum information spreading in generalised dual-unitary circuits</h3>

<br>
<i>Alessandro Foligno, Pavel Kos, Bruno Bertini</i>
<p>We study the spreading of quantum information in a recently introduced family
of brickwork quantum circuits that generalises the dual-unitary class. These
circuits are unitary in time, while their spatial dynamics is unitary only in a
restricted subspace. First, we show that local operators spread at the speed of
light as in dual-unitary circuits, i.e., the butterfly velocity takes the
maximal value allowed by the geometry of the circuit. Then, we prove that the
entanglement spreading can still be characterised exactly for a family of
compatible initial states (in fact, for an extension of the compatible family
of dual-unitary circuits) and that the asymptotic entanglement slope is again
independent on the R\'enyi index. Remarkably, however, we find that the
entanglement velocity is generically smaller than one. We use these properties
to find a closed-form expression for the entanglement membrane in these
circuits.

<h3>Surface induced odd-frequency spin-triplet superconductivity as a  veritable signature of Majorana bound states</h3>

<br>
<i>Subhajit Pal, Colin Benjamin</i>
<p>We predict surface-induced odd-frequency (odd-$\nu$) spin-triplet
superconducting pairing can be a veritable signature of Majorana bound states
(MBS) in a Josephson nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$)-spin flipper
(SF)-nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$) junction. Remarkably, in a
$p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction, three distinct phases emerge: the
topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the
trivial phase devoid of MBS. When MBS appear, surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet
pairing is induced only in the topological regime. In contrast, surface-induced
even-frequency (even-$\nu$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the
existence of MBS. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the
topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the
topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced
surface odd-$\nu$ spin triplet superconductivity.

<h3>Scattering theory of mesons in doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators:  Multichannel perspective and Feshbach resonance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02978" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02978</a>
<br>
<i>Lukas Homeier, Pit Bermes, Fabian Grusdt</i>
<p>Modeling the underlying pairing mechanism of charge carriers in strongly
correlated electrons, starting from a microscopic theory, is among the central
challenges of condensed-matter physics. Hereby, the key task is to understand
what causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high
temperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator.
Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the
fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and
bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing
near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we
provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open
and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a
truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by
bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open
channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows
us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed)
attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce
provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach
scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a
foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing
mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.

<h3>Feshbach hypothesis of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates</h3>

<br>
<i>Lukas Homeier, Hannah Lange, Eugene Demler, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt</i>
<p>Resonant interactions associated with the emergence of a bound state
constitute one of the cornerstones of modern many-body physics, ranging from
Kondo physics, BEC-BCS crossover, to tunable interactions at Feshbach
resonances in ultracold atoms or 2D semiconductors. Here we present a Feshbach
perspective on the origin of strong pairing in Fermi-Hubbard type models. We
perform a theoretical analysis of interactions between charge carriers in doped
Mott insulators, modeled by a near-resonant two-channel scattering problem, and
find strong evidence for Feshbach-type interactions in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$
channel that can support strong pairing, consistent with the established
phenomenology of cuprates. Existing experimental and numerical results on
hole-doped cuprates lead us to conjecture the existence of a light, long-lived,
low-energy excited state of two holes with bipolaron character in these
systems, which enables near-resonant interactions and can thus provide a
microscopic foundation for theories of high-temperature superconductivity
involving strong attraction, as assumed e.g. in BEC-BCS crossover scenarios. To
put our theory to a direct test we suggest to use coincidence angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES), pair-tunneling measurements or less direct
pump-probe experiments. The emergent Feshbach resonance we propose could also
underlie superconductivity in other doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, as
recently proposed for bilayer nickelates, highlighting its potential as a
unifying strong-coupling pairing mechanism rooted in quantum magnetism.
