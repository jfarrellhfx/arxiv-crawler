<h3>Estudio de materiales para la formacion de aleaciones de alta entropia  utilizables en el almacenamiento de hidrogeno</h3>

<i>Jhonn Hary Royero Barraza</i>
<p>In this degree work, a theoretical computational study on high entropy alloys
(HEAs) was carried out. Two specific alloys were chosen for study, AlCoCrFeNi
and TiVZrNbHf. The study was based on the parameters deduced from the
Hume-Rothery rules, thermodynamics and the configurational (or mixing) elastic
energy. The enthalpy of formation was studied as a contribution due to the
configurational elastic energy, with the objective of being able to know which
are the chemical elements and their respective molar proportions, in such a way
that the formation of HEAs and the storage of hydrogen are favoured. To achieve
this, a FORTRAN90 program was developed, which allowed a wide variety of
results that are generally in agreement with the theoretical-experimental
literature. In general, it was found that the approximation that exists by
considering that the HEAs are elastically isotropic is correct, where it was
assumed that there is an equivalent average Bulk lus for each atomic species.

<p>Non-destructive cross-sectional characterization of materials systems with a
resolution in the nanometer range and the ability to allow for time-resolved
in-situ studies is of great importance in material science. Here, we present
such a measurements method, extreme ultraviolet coherence tomography (XCT). The
method is non-destructive during sample preparation as well as during the
measurement, which is distinguished by a negligible thermal load as compared to
electron microscopy methods. Laser-generated radiation in the extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) and soft x-ray range is used for characterization. The
measurement principle is interferometric and the signal evaluation is performed
via an iterative Fourier analysis. The method is demonstrated on the metallic
material system Al-Al$_2$Cu and compared to electron and atomic force
microscopy measurements. We also present advanced reconstruction methods for
XCT which even allow for the determination of the roughness of outer and inner
interfaces.

<h3>A method of estimating the content of crystalline phases in multiphase  samples based on X-ray diffraction data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10750</a>
<br>
<i>S.V. Gabielkov, I.V. Zhyganiuk, A.D. Skorbun</i>
<p>A method for estimating the relative content of crystalline phases of a
multiphase sample, based on probabilistic analysis of the intensities of the
diffraction pattern reflexes, has been developed. The method is based on the
introduction of some numerical parameter, which uniquely characterizes the
diffraction pattern, and comparison of the diffraction patterns according to
this parameter, using methods of computational statistics. In situations where
the absorption coefficients of the phases are close, the method works solely on
the analysis of the diffraction pattern data from a specific multiphase sample.
It is shown on the control measurements that the uncertainty of the estimates
does not exceed $\pm 8$~\%.

<h3>Probing the tunable multi-cone bandstructure in Bernal bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10816" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10816</a>
<br>
<i>Anna M. Seiler, Nils Jacobsen, Martin Statz, Noelia Fernandez, Francesca Falorsi, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Zhiyu Dong, Leonid S. Levitov, R. Thomas Weitz</i>
<p>Controlling the bandstructure of Dirac materials is of wide interest in
current research but has remained an outstanding challenge for systems such as
monolayer graphene. In contrast, Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) offers a highly
flexible platform for tuning the bandstructure, featuring two distinct regimes.
In one regime, which is well established and widely used, a tunable bandgap is
induced by a large enough transverse displacement field. Another is a gapless
metallic band occurring near charge neutrality and at not too strong fields,
featuring rich 'fine structure' consisting of four linearly-dispersing Dirac
cones with opposite chiralities in each valley and van Hove singularities. Even
though BLG was extensively studied experimentally in the last two decades, the
evidence of this exotic bandstructure is still elusive, likely due to
insufficient energy resolution. Here, rather than probing the bandstructure by
direct spectroscopy, we use Landau levels as markers of the energy dispersion
and carefully analyze the Landau level spectrum in a regime where the cyclotron
orbits of electrons or holes in momentum space are small enough to resolve the
distinct mini Dirac cones. We identify the presence of four distinct Dirac
cones and map out complex topological transitions induced by electric
displacement field. These findings introduce a valuable addition to the toolkit
for graphene electronics.

<h3>Eigenstate entanglement entropy in the integrable  spin-\texorpdfstring{$\frac{1}{2}$}{1/2} XYZ model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10819</a>
<br>
<i>Rafał Świętek, Maksymilian Kliczkowski, Lev Vidmar, Marcos Rigol</i>
<p>We study the average and the standard deviation of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited eigenstates of the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
XYZ chain away from and at special lines with $U(1)$ symmetry and
supersymmetry. We universally find that the average eigenstate entanglement
entropy exhibits a volume-law coefficient that is smaller than that of
quantum-chaotic interacting models. At the supersymmetric point, we resolve the
effect that degeneracies have on the computed averages. We further find that
the normalized standard deviation of the eigenstate entanglement entropy decays
polynomially with increasing system size, which we contrast to the exponential
decay in quantum-chaotic interacting models. Our results provide state-of-the
art numerical evidence that integrability in spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains reduces
the average, and increases the standard deviation, of the entanglement entropy
of highly excited energy eigenstates when compared to those in quantum-chaotic
interacting models.

<h3>Scaling laws of failure dynamics on complex networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10850</a>
<br>
<i>G. Pál, Zs. Danku, A. Batool, V. Kádár, N. Yoshioka, N. Ito, G. Ódor, F. Kun</i>
<p>The topology of the network of load transmitting connections plays an
essential role in the cascading failure dynamics of complex systems driven by
the redistribution of load after local breakdown events. In particular, as the
network structure is gradually tuned from regular to completely random a
transition occurs from the localized to mean field behavior of failure
spreading. Based on finite size scaling in the fiber bundle model of failure
phenomena, here we demonstrate that outside the localized regime, the load
bearing capacity and damage tolerance on the macro-scale, and the statistics of
clusters of failed nodes on the micro-scale obey scaling laws with exponents
which depend on the topology of the load transmission network and on the degree
of disorder of the strength of nodes. Most notably, we show that the spatial
structure of damage governs the emergence of the localized to mean field
transition: as the network gets gradually randomized failed clusters formed on
locally regular patches merge through long range links generating a percolation
like transition which reduces the load concentration on the network. The
results may help to design network structures with an improved robustness
against cascading failure.

<h3>Wave function propagation in a two-dimensional paramagnetic  semiconductor from an impurity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10853</a>
<br>
<i>Josh Wanninger, Gonzalo Ordonez</i>
<p>We simulated modifications to a model of a two-dimensional paramagnetic
semiconductor called the half-BHZ model, also known as the QWZ model, and
simulated a modified full BHZ model, where a time reversal pair is introduced.
Our modifications to the models include adding single and multiple impurities
connected to the lattices or as a connection between the time-reversal pairs.
We employed the Julia programming language to show how to speed up calculations
for time evolutions. By simulating the time evolutions, we could observe the
differences in the effects of these modifications. Our simulations showed the
presence of scattering behavior associated with the infinite QWZ model
topological states. Moreover, we observed scattering and absorption behavior
related to the parameters and placements of impurities and Hamiltonian
imaginary component's symmetry or anti-symmetry. These tools and early results
lay the foundations for developing electronic devices that use the models'
unique scattering and absorption behaviors and explore more complex and
physically accurate modifications to the models.

<h3>Research on solitons interactions' in one-dimensional indium chains on  Si(111) surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10860</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Yao, Chaojie Luo, Xiuxia Wang, Hui Zhang</i>
<p>Solitons have garnered significant attention across various fields, yet a
contentious debate persists regarding the precise structure of solitons on
indium chains. Currently, multiple forms of solitons in one-dimensional atomic
chains have been reported. STM provides an effective means to study the precise
atomic structure of solitons, particularly their dynamics and interactions.
However, limited research has been conducted on soliton interactions and
soliton-chain interactions, despite their profound impact on relative soliton
motions and the overall physical properties of the system. In this work, we
characterized the structures of the soliton dimer and trimer, observed the
displacements induced by the soliton entity and statisticized the dynamic
behaviors of soliton dimers over time evolution or temperature. To reveal the
soliton mechanism, we further utilized STM to investigate the CDWs between two
solitons when two monomers were encountered. Additionally, we achieved the
manipulation of the monomer on the indium chain by the STM tip. Our work serves
as an important approach to elucidate interactions in correlated electronic
systems and advance the development of potential topological soliton computers.

<h3>Derivation of an effective plate theory for parallelogram origami from  bar and hinge elasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10870" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10870</a>
<br>
<i>Hu Xu, Ian Tobasco, Paul Plucinsky</i>
<p>Periodic origami patterns made with repeating unit cells of creases and
panels can bend and twist in complex ways. In principle, such soft modes of
deformation admit a simplified asymptotic description in the limit of a large
number of cells. Starting from a bar and hinge model for the elastic energy of
a generic four parallelogram panel origami pattern, we derive a complete set of
geometric compatibility conditions identifying the pattern's soft modes in this
limit. The compatibility equations form a system of partial differential
equations constraining the actuation of the origami's creases (a scalar angle
field) and the relative rotations of its unit cells (a pair of skew tensor
fields). We show that every solution of the compatibility equations admits a
well-defined soft mode -- a sequence of origami deformations with finite
bending energy and negligible stretching. We also show that the limiting energy
of these sequences is a plate-like theory for parallelogram origami patterns
with an explicit coarse-grained quadratic energy depending on the gradient of
the crease-actuation and the relative rotations of the cells. Finally, we
illustrate our theory in the context of two well-known origami designs: the
Miura and Eggbox patterns. Though these patterns are distinguished in their
anticlastic and synclastic bending responses, they show a universal twisting
response. General soft modes captured by our theory involve a rich nonlinear
interplay between actuation, bending and twisting, determined by the underlying
crease geometry.

<h3>Graphene-like nanoribbons connected by four-/five- membered rings on  pentacene/picene precursors, Au(110) surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10889</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Yao, Shuangxiang Wu, Hui Zhang</i>
<p>The rapid development of functional graphene-like nanoribbons with
high-quality has become increasingly reliant on multiple nanofabrication
platforms while traditional methods are facing mounting limitations in this
regard. Consequently, the demand for novel techniques to explore and manipulate
graphene-like nanoribbons has surged. Herein, we report an on-surface synthesis
of graphene-like nanoribbons on pentacene/picene monomers via a series of
self-assembly and annealing on the one-dimensional(1D) Au(110) substrate. Our
scanning tunneling microscope(STM) research reveals that four-/eight- membered
rings are formed between adjacent molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
technique to manipulate the pentacene dimer without breaking its structure by
operating an STM tip. Our results exhibit a possible platform for developing
next generation graphene-based quantum computing designs and a technique to
obtain multiple functional graphene-like nanoribbons with high-precision.

<h3>Structural and magnetic properties of molecular beam epitaxy  (MnSb2Te4)x(Sb2Te3)1-x topological materials with exceedingly high Curie  temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10891</a>
<br>
<i>Candice R. Forrester, Christophe Testelin, Kaushini Wickramasinghe, Ido Levy, Dominique Demaille, David Hrabovski, Xiaxin Ding, Lia Krusin-Elbaum, Gustavo E. Lopez, Maria C. Tamargo</i>
<p>Tuning magnetic properties of magnetic topological materials is of interest
to realize elusive physical phenomena such as quantum anomalous hall effect
(QAHE) at higher temperatures and design topological spintronic devices.
However, current topological materials exhibit Curie temperature (TC) values
far below room temperature. In recent years, significant progress has been made
to control and optimize TC, particularly through defect engineering of these
structures. Most recently we showed evidence of TC values up to 80K for
(MnSb2Te4)x(Sb2Te3)1-x, where x is greater than or equal to 0.7 and less than
or equal to 0.85, by controlling the compositions and Mn content in these
structures. Here we show further enhancement of the TC, as high as 100K, by
maintaining high Mn content and reducing the growth rate from 0.9 nm/min to 0.5
nm/min. Derivative curves reveal the presence of two TC components contributing
to the overall value and propose TC1 and TC2 have distinct origins: excess Mn
in SLs and Mn in Sb2-yMnyTe3QLs alloys, respectively. In pursuit of elucidating
the mechanisms promoting higher Curie temperature values in this system, we
show evidence of structural disorder where Mn is occupying not only Sb sites
but also Te sites, providing evidence of significant excess Mn and a new
crystal structure:(Mn1+ySb2-yTe4)x(Sb2-yMnyTe3)1-x. Our work shows progress in
understanding how to control magnetic defects to enhance desired magnetic
properties and the mechanism promoting these high TC in magnetic topological
materials such as (Mn1+ySb2-yTe4)x(Sb2-yMnyTe3)1-x.

<h3>Dynamical correlation functions from complex time evolution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10909</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaodong Cao, Yi Lu, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Olivier Parcollet</i>
<p>We present an approach to tame the growth of entanglement during time
evolution by tensor network methods. It combines time evolution in the complex
plane with a perturbative and controlled reconstruction of correlation
functions on the real-time axis. We benchmark our approach on the single
impurity Anderson model. Compared to purely real-time evolution, the complex
time evolution significantly reduces the required bond dimension to obtain the
spectral function. Notably, our approach yields self-energy results with high
precision at low frequencies, comparable to numerical renormalization group
(NRG) results, and it successfully captures the exponentially small Kondo
energy scale.

<h3>Multi-valent Ion Mediated Polyelectrolyte Association and Structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10914</a>
<br>
<i>Alec Glisman, Sriteja Mantha, Decai Yu, Eric Wasserman, Scott Backer, Zhen-Gang Wang</i>
<p>Polyelectrolytes are commonly used to chelate multi-valent ions in aqueous
solutions, playing a critical role in water softening and the prevention of
mineralization. At sufficient ionic strength, ion-mediated
polyelectrolyte--polyelectrolyte interactions can precipitate
polyelectrolyte--ion complexes, a phenomenon known as "like-charge attraction".
While the significant influence of small ions on polyelectrolyte solution phase
behavior is recognized, the precise molecular mechanisms driving the
counterintuitive phenomenon remain largely elusive. In this study, we employ
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanism
of like-charge attraction between two poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) chains in
solution. We find that moderate quantities of Ca$^{2+}$ ions induce attraction
between PAA chains, facilitated by the formation of PAA--Ca$^{2+}$--PAA bridges
and a significant increase in the coordination of Ca$^{2+}$ ions by the PAA
chains. At high Ca$^{2+}$ number densities, ion bridges are disfavored due to
electrostatic screening, yet the chains are still attracted to each other due
to solvent-mediated interactions between the chains and their chelated ions.
The insights gleaned from this study not only enrich our understanding of the
intricate mechanism of like-charge attraction between polyanions in solution
but also illuminate the influence of multi-valent ions on polyelectrolyte
interactions.

<h3>Hydrogen Doping Induced $p_x\pm ip_y$ Triplet Superconductivity in  Quasi-One-Dimensional K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10942" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10942</a>
<br>
<i>Ming Zhang, Chen Lu, Yajiang Chen, Yunbo Zhang, Fan Yang</i>
<p>Quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Cr-based pnictide K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ has aroused
great research interest due to its possible triplet superconducting pairing
symmetry. Recent experiments have shown that incorporating hydrogen atoms into
K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ would significantly change its electronic and magnetic
properties. Hence, it's necessary to investigate the impact of hydrogen doping
in superconducting pairing symmetry of this material. Employing the hydrogen as
an non-trivial electron-doping, our calculates show that, different from the
$p_z$-wave obtained without hydrogen, the system exhibits $p_x\pm ip_y$ pairing
superconductivity under specific hydrogen doping. Specifically, we adopt the
random-phase-approximation approach based on a six-band tight-binding model
equipped with multi-orbital Hubbard interactions to study the hydrogen-doping
dependence of the pairing symmetry and superconducting $T_c$. Under the
rigid-band approximation, our pairing phase diagram shows the spin-triplet
pairing states is dominated through out the hydrogen-doping regime $x\in
(0,0.7)$. Particularly, the $T_c\sim x$ curve shows a peak at the 3D-quasi-1D
Lifshitz transition point, and the pairing symmetry around this doping level is
$p_x\pm ip_y$. The physical origin of this pairing symmetry is that the density
of states is mainly concentrated at $k_x(k_y)$ with large momentum. Due to the
three-dimensional character of the real material, this $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave
superconducting state possesses point gap nodes. We further provide experiment
prediction to identify this triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave superconductivity.

<h3>2d Quantum Breakdown Model with Krylov Subspace Many-Body Localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10968" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10968</a>
<br>
<i>Xinyu Liu, Biao Lian</i>
<p>We propose a two-dimensional (2d) quantum breakdown model of hardcore bosons
interacting with disordered spins, which resembles particles incident into
supersaturated vapor. The model exhibits a strong fragmentation into Krylov
subspaces in each symmetry sector. The Hamiltonian in each Krylov subspace maps
to a single-particle problem in a Cayley tree-like graph, which enters a 2d
many-body localization (MBL) phase beyond certain disorder strength $W_*$, as
indicated by Poisson level spacing statistics and entanglement entropy growing
as $\log t$ with time $t$. Our theoretical arguments suggest $W_*$ is finite or
zero for boson number $N_b\lesssim L^\gamma/\log L$ ($1/2\le \gamma \le 1$) as
system size $L\rightarrow\infty$. At zero disorder, the model also exhibits
fully or partially solvable features, such as degenerate quantum scar states.

<h3>The temperature dependent Boltzmann equation beyond local equilibrium  assumption</h3>

<br>
<i>Zheng-Chuan Wang</i>
<p>In this manuscript, we present a temperature dependent Boltzmann equation for
the particles transport through a environmental reservoir, where the
temperature refers to the equilibrium temperature of reservoir, a new damping
force and a inverse damping relaxation time are derived based on the classical
Boltzmann equation, which have obvious influence on the external force and the
relaxation time of transport particles. For comparison, we also define a
non-equilibrium temperature for the transport particle by its distribution
function out of equilibrium, which is different from the equilibrium
temperature of reservoir. There exist heat transfer between the transport
particle and the reservoir, because the whole transport particles are in
non-equilibrium state. Finally, we illustrate them by an example of
one-dimensional transport procedure, the damping force and the non-equilibrium
temperature defined by us are shown numerically.

<p>We report an experimental study of the disordered Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
model, implemented in a system of coaxial cables, whose radio frequency
properties map on to the SSH Hamiltonian. By measuring multiple chains with
random hopping terms, we demonstrate the presence of a topologically protected
state, with frequency variation of less than 0.2% over the ensemble. Connecting
the ends of the chains to form loops, we observe a topological phase

states which are delocalised, despite the strong disorder.

<h3>AIMS-EREA -- A framework for AI-accelerated Innovation of Materials for  Sustainability -- for Environmental Remediation and Energy Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11060</a>
<br>
<i>Sudarson Roy Pratihar, Deepesh Pai, Manaswita Nag</i>
<p>Many environmental remediation and energy applications (conversion and
storage) for sustainability need design and development of green novel
materials. Discovery processes of such novel materials are time taking and
cumbersome due to large number of possible combinations and permutations of
materials structures. Often theoretical studies based on Density Functional
Theory (DFT) and other theories, coupled with Simulations are conducted to
narrow down sample space of candidate materials, before conducting
laboratory-based synthesis and analytical process. With the emergence of
artificial intelligence (AI), AI techniques are being tried in this process too
to ease out simulation time and cost. However tremendous values of previously
published research from various parts of the world are still left as
labor-intensive manual effort and discretion of individual researcher and prone
to human omissions. AIMS-EREA is our novel framework to blend best of breed of
Material Science theory with power of Generative AI to give best impact and
smooth and quickest discovery of material for sustainability. This also helps
to eliminate the possibility of production of hazardous residues and
bye-products of the reactions. AIMS-EREA uses all available resources --
Predictive and Analytical AI on large collection of chemical databases along
with automated intelligent assimilation of deep materials knowledge from
previously published research works through Generative AI. We demonstrate use
of our own novel framework with an example, how this framework can be
successfully applied to achieve desired success in development of
thermoelectric material for waste heat conversion.

<h3>A first-principles study of the electronic, vibrational, and optical  properties of planar SiC quantum dots</h3>

<br>
<i>Rupali Jindal, Vaishali Roondhe, Alok Shukla</i>
<p>With the reported synthesis of a fully planar 2D silicon carbide (SiC)
allotrope, the possibilities of its technological applications are enormous.
Recently, several authors have computationally studied the structures and
electronic properties of a variety of novel infinite periodic SiC monolayers,
in addition to the honeycomb one. In this work, we perform a systematic
first-principles investigation of the geometry, electronic structure,
vibrational, and optical absorption spectra of several finite, but, fully
planar structures of SiC, i.e., 0D quantum dots (QDs). The sizes of the studied
structures are in the 1.20--2.28 nm range, with their computed HOMO(H)-LUMO(L)
gaps ranging from 0.66 eV to 4.09 eV, i.e., from the IR to the UV region of the
spectrum. The H-L gaps in the SiC QDs are larger as compared to the band gaps
of the corresponding monolayers, confirming the quantum confinement effects. In
spite of covalent bonding in the QDs, Mulliken charge analysis reveals that Si
atoms exhibit positive charges, whereas the C atoms acquire negative charges,
due to the different electron affinities of the two atoms. Furthermore, a
strong structure property relationship is observed with fingerprints both in
the vibrational and optical spectra. The wide range of H-L gaps in different
SiC QDs makes them well-suited for applications in fields such as
photocatalysis, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells.

<br>
<i>A. L. Araújo, F. Crasto de Lima, C. H. Lewenkopf, A. Fazzio</i>
<p>Spin-orbital textures in topological insulators due to the spin locking with
the electron momentum, play an important role in spintronic phenomena that
arise from the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom. We have
explored interfaces between a ferromagnetic system (CrI$_3$) and a topological
insulator (Bi$_2$Se$_3$) that allow the manipulation of spin-orbital textures.
Within an {\it ab initio} approach we have extracted the spin-orbital-textures
dependence of experimentally achievable interface designs. The presence of the
ferromagnetic system introduces anisotropic transport of the electronic spin
and charge. From a parameterized Hamiltonian model we capture the anisotropic
backscattering behavior, showing its extension to other
ferromagnetic/topological insulator interfaces. We verified that the van der
Waals TI/MI interface is an excellent platform for controlling the spin degree
of freedom arising from topological states, providing a rich family of
unconventional spin texture configurations.

<p>We self-consistently calculate the supercurrent diode effect from microscopic

<p>Terahertz technologies are important for a number of emerging applications,
such as for next generation communications. We predict that transition metal
substitutional defects in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) can serve as quantum defects for terahertz technologies. Central to this
prediction is the finding that the zero field splittings between spin sublevels
in such defects are typically in the sub-terahertz to terahertz range due to
the large spin-orbit coupling in these systems. As a proof of concept, we
consider different transition metal impurities from across the periodic table,
in prototypical TMDs, MoS2 and WSe2. Using first principles calculations, we
demonstrate that selected spin triplet defects can potentially serve as qubits
operating in the terahertz regime. We also propose defects that can potentially
be quantum sources of terahertz radiation. Our research broadens the scope of
advancements in quantum information science and lays a foundation for their
integration with THz technologies.

<p>We theoretically investigate the acoustic analogues of high-angular-momentum
rotating black holes in exciton-polariton condensates. Performing numerical
simulations of a long-lived ring-shaped condensate configuration with an
acoustic horizon and ergoregion for high angular momentum states, we observed a
quasi-stable state near critical angular momentum where the acoustic black hole
horizon disappears. Our findings offer an insight into the quantum nature of
the instability of naked singularity.

<p>Superconducting states onsetting at moderately high temperatures have been
observed in epitaxially-stabilized RENiO2-based thin films. However, recently
it has also been reported that superconductivity at high temperatures is
observed in bulk La3Ni2O7-{\delta} at high pressure, opening further
possibilities for study. Here we report the reduction profile of La3Ni2O7 in a
stream of 5% H2/Ar gas and the isolation of the metastable intermediate phase
La3Ni2O6.45, which is based on Ni2+. Although this reduced phase does not
superconduct at ambient or high pressures, it offers insights into the Ni-327
system and encourages the future study of nickelates as a function of oxygen
content.

<p>Intercalation (ic) of metal atoms into the van der Waals (vdW) gap of layered
materials constitutes a facile strategy to create new materials whose
properties can be tuned via the concentration of the intercalated atoms. Here
we perform systematic density functional theory calculations to explore various
properties of an emergent class of crystalline 2D materials (ic-2D materials)
comprising vdW homobilayers with native metal atoms on a sublattice of
intercalation sites. From an initial set of 1348 ic-2D materials, generated
from 77 vdW homobilayers, we find 95 structures with good thermodynamic
stability (formation energy within 200 meV/atom of the convex hull). A
significant fraction of the semiconducting host materials are found to undergo
an insulator to metal transition upon self-intercalation with only PdS$_2$,
PdSe$_2$, and GeS$_2$ maintaining a finite electronic gap. In five cases,
self-intercalation introduces magnetism. In general, self-intercalation is
found to promote metallicity and enhance the chemical reactivity on the basal
plane. Based on the calculated H binding energy we find that self-intercalated
SnS$_2$ and Hf$_3$Te$_2$ are promising candidates for hydrogen evolution
catalysis. All the stable ic-2D structures and their calculated properties can
be explored in the open C2DB database.

<h3>Busting the Myth of Spontaneous Formation of H2O2 at the Air-Water  Interface: Contributions of the Liquid-Solid Interface and Dissolved Oxygen  Exposed</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11133" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11133</a>
<br>
<i>Muzzamil Ahmad Eatoo, Himanshu Mishra</i>
<p>Recent reports on the spontaneous formation of H2O2(aq) at the air-water
interface and the solid-water interface have been sensational. The speculated
mechanism at the air-water interface is based on instantaneous ultrahigh
electric fields and the micro-scale of droplets, whereas the solid-water
interface is speculated to be the site for oxidation of water (or hydroxide
ions) and reduction of the solid surface. We utilized 1H-NMR spectroscopy to
investigate the effects of the nebulizing gas, the dissolved oxygen content,
and solid substrates on the H2O2(aq) formation (detection limit 50 nM).
Experiments revealed that contrary to the sensational claims, the air-water
interface is not the site for H2O2(aq) formation; instead, it is the
solid-water interface where H2O2(aq) is formed during the reduction of
dissolved oxygen and oxidation of the solid surface. Curiously, the tendencies
of solid substrates towards forming H2O2(aq) follow the classic Galvanic
series. This report advances the current understanding of aquatic chemistry and
should be relevant to corrosion science, surface science, and electrochemistry.

<h3>Investigating the effect of Na$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$, and Cu$^{2+}$ sorption in  montmorillonite using density functional theory and molecular dynamics  simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11139</a>
<br>
<i>Yalda Pedram, Yaoting Zhang, Scott Briggs, Chang Seok Kim, Andrey G. Kalinichev, Laurent Karim Béland</i>
<p>Montmorillonite (MMT) is the main mineral component of bentonite clay, which
is currently proposed as a sealing material for deep geological repositories
(DGRs) of used nuclear fuel. If copper-cladded used fuel containers corrode,
Cu$^{2+}$ ions could potentially be adsorbed by the surrounding MMT. In such a
scenario, ion exchange between Na$^+$ and Cu$^{2+}$ is expected. In this study,
a multiscale approach that combines electronic density functional theory (DFT)
and force-field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was employed to study
the effect of introducing Cu$^{2+}$ ions to MMT. An extension to the ClayFF
force field is parametrized and validated using DFT, to model how Cu$^{2+}$
interact with clay systems. MD simulations were performed to calculate the
interaction free energies between MMT platelets containing Cu$^{2+}$ ions
(Cu-MMT) and compared them to inter-platelet interaction energies in Na-MMT and
Ca-MMT. Our calculations suggest Cu-MMT possesses swelling pressures
intermediate between those of Ca-MMT and Na-MMT. Furthermore, our MD
simulations suggest Cu$^{2+}$ possesses MMT interlayer mobility similar to that
of Ca$^{2+}$.

<h3>A hybrid pulsed laser deposition approach to grow thin films of  chalcogenides</h3>

<i>Mythili Surendran, Shantanu Singh, Huandong Chen, Claire Wu, Amir Avishai, Yu-Tsun Shao, Jayakanth Ravichandran</i>
<p>Vapor-pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides
have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and
technological importance. However, epitaxial growth of vapor-pressure
mismatched materials are challenging due to differences in the reactivity,
sticking coefficient, and surface adatom mobility of the mismatched species
constituting the material, especially sulfur containing compounds. Here, we
report a novel approach to grow chalcogenides - hybrid pulsed laser deposition
- wherein an organosulfur precursor is used as a sulfur source in conjunction
with pulsed laser deposition to regulate the stoichiometry of the deposited
films. Epitaxial or textured thin films of sulfides with variety of structure
and chemistry such as alkaline metal chalcogenides, main group chalcogenides,
transition metal chalcogenides and chalcogenide perovskites are demonstrated,
and structural characterization reveal improvement in thin film crystallinity,
and surface and interface roughness compared to the state-of-the-art. The
growth method can be broadened to other vapor-pressure mismatched chalcogenides
such as selenides and tellurides. Our work opens up opportunities for broader
epitaxial growth of chalcogenides, especially sulfide-based thin film
technological applications.

<i>Ralph V. Chamberlin</i>
<p>The 2nd law of thermodynamics yields an irreversible increase in entropy
until thermal equilibrium is achieved. This irreversible increase is often
assumed to require large and complex systems to emerge from the reversible
microscopic laws of physics. We test this assumption using simulations and
theory of a 1D ring of N Ising spins coupled to an explicit heat bath of N
Einstein oscillators. The exact entropy of the spins and bath can be calculated
for any N, with dynamics that is readily altered from reversible to
irreversible. We find thermal equilibrium behavior in the thermodynamic limit,
and in systems as small as N=2, but only if the microscopic dynamics is
intrinsically irreversible.

<h3>Ridge instability in dense suspensions caused by the second normal  stress difference</h3>

<i>Zhongqiang Xiong, Peter Angerman, Marco Ellero, Bjornar Sandnes, Ryohei Seto</i>
<p>A dense suspension of the cornstarch flowing on a very inclined wall finally
forms some ridge-like patterns of the free surface. The onset of pattern
formation is the primary target to elucidate the mechanism. In this work, based
on the continuity of fluids and the force balance, the second normal stress
difference $N_2$ is identified to be an essential ingredient for developing
such patterns by the linear instability analysis. Assuming a linear dependence
of $N_2$ on shear stress, we use an instability criterion to predict the
critical slope angle for the formation of ridge patterns. The estimated
critical angle was found in excellent agreement with experimental observations.

<p>High energy x-ray diffraction microscopy was used to image the microstructure
of $\alpha$-Fe before and after a 600 $^\circ$C anneal. These data were used to
determine the areas, curvatures, energies, and velocities of approximately
40,000 grain boundaries. The measured grain boundary properties depend on the
five macroscopic grain boundary parameters. The velocities are not correlated
with the product of the mean boundary curvature and grain boundary energy,
usually assumed to be the driving force. Boundary migration is made up of area
changes (lateral motion) and translation (normal motion) and both contribute to
the total migration. Through the lateral motion component of the migration, low
energy boundaries tend to expand in area while high energy boundaries shrink,
reducing the average energy through grain boundary replacement. The driving
force for this process is not related to curvature and might disrupt the
expected curvature-velocity relationship.

<h3>A study on the thermal conductance of interface between dissimilar  metals</h3>

<i>Dian Li, Joseph Feser</i>
<p>Whether diffuse mismatch model for electrons (DMMe) hold true in more general
cases remains largely unexplored, especially in cases where at least one
material does not behave like a free-electron metal and/or the interface is
smooth enough to allow non-diffuse transmission of electrons. In this study,
DMMe was proposed to predict the thermal conductance of metal-metal interfaces.
A set of aluminum-X samples (X = Cu, Ag, Fe, Ni) were grown and the time domain
thermoreflectance (TDTR) technique was used to measure the metal-metal
interface conductance. It was then compared to the two variants of the
DMMe-using both a crude theory based on free-electron metals and accurate band
structures provided by density functional theory.

<i>Chao-Ze Lu, Xiaolong Deng, Su-Peng Kou, Gaoyong Sun</i>
<p>We study many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic
transversed field Ising model with an imaginary field and show that the system
exhibits three phase transitions: one second-order phase transition and two
$\mathcal{PT}$ phase transitions. The second-order phase transition occurring
in the ground state is investigated via biorthogonal and self-normal
entanglement entropy, for which we develop an approach to perform finite-size
scaling theory to extract the central charge for small systems. Compared with
the second-order phase transition, the first $\mathcal{PT}$ transition is
characterized by the appearance of an exceptional point in the full energy
spectrum, while the second $\mathcal{PT}$ transition only occurs in specific
excited states. Furthermore, we interestingly show that both of exceptional
points are second-order in terms of scalings of imaginary parts of the energy.
This work provides an exact solution for unconventional many-body phase
transitions in non-Hermitian systems.

<h3>Effect of the entropy on the shear viscosity of metallic glasses near  the glass transition</h3>

<br>
<i>A.S. Makarov, J.B. Cui, J.C. Qiao, G.V. Afonin, N.P. Kobelev, V.A. Khonik</i>
<p>We measured the shear viscosity of 14 metallic glasses differing with their
mixing entropy $\Delta S_{mix}$. It is found that the viscosity at the glass
transition temperature $T_g$ significantly increases with $\Delta S_{mix}$.
Using calorimetric data, we calculated the excess entropy of all glasses
$\Delta S$ with respect to their maternal crystalline states as a function of
temperature. It is shown that the excess entropy $\Delta S$ both at room
temperature and at $T_g$ \textit{decreases} with $\Delta S_{mix}$. It is
concluded that glasses with "high mixing entropy" $\Delta S_{mix}$ correspond
to MGs with \textit{low} excess entropy $\Delta S$. The origin of the increased
shear viscosity at $T_g$ of glasses with high $\Delta S_{mix}$ is determined by
their reduced excess entropy $\Delta S$.

<h3>Non-Hermitian effect to the ballistic transport and quantized Hall  conductivity in an operable experimental platform</h3>

<i>Chen-Huan Wu, Yida Li</i>
<p>By designing a multi-channel millimeter Hall measurement configuration, we
realize the carrier-density (locally) controllable measurement on the transport
property in 2H MoS$_{2}$. We observe a linearly increased Hall conductivity and
exponentially decreased resistivity as the increase of dc current. The
intrinsically large band gap does not exhibit too much effect on our
measurement, as far as the magnetic field is above the critical value, which is
$B=6$ T for 2H-MoS$_{2}$. Instead, the edge effect which emerge as a result of
one-dimensional channels. This is different from the Corbino geometry which is
widely applied on semiconductors, where the edges are absent. At room
temperature, we observe that the emergent quantized quantum Hall plateaus are
at the same value for both the two measurements, which implies that the
quantized conductivity does not depends on the non-Hermitian interactions, but
the number of partially filled Landau levels, and this is in consistent with
the previous theoretical works\cite{Siddiki}. At low-temperature limit, the
Hall plateaus are destroyed due to the filtered contribution from the electrons
above fermi energy, and in this case, the two measuremens exhibits stronger
distinction, where we observe stronger fluctuations (of voltage, conductivity,
and resistivity) at the currents between where there are Hall plateaus at
higher temperature.

<br>
<i>Xiang Li, Jia-Wen Li, Jing-Yang You, Gang Su, Bo Gu</i>
<p>Doping nonmagnetic semiconductors with magnetic impurities is a feasible way
to obtain diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). It is generally accepted that
for the most extensively studied DMS, (Ga, Mn)As, its highest Curie temperature
T$_{\text{C}}$ was achieved at 200 K with a Mn concentration of approximately
16% in experiments. A recent experiment reported record-breaking high electron
and hole mobilities in the semiconductor BAs [Science 377, 437 (2022)]. Since
BAs shares the same zinc-blende structure with GaAs, here we predict four DMSs
(B, Mn)X (X = N, P, As, Sb) by density functional theory calculations. Our
results indicate that a significantly higher T$_{\text{C}}$ in the range of 254
K to 300 K for (B, Mn)As with a Mn concentration of around 15.6%, and even
higher T$_{\text{C}}$ values above the room temperature for (B, Mn)N and (B,
Mn)P with a Mn concentration exceeding 12.5%. Furthermore, we have predicted a
large hole mobility of 1561 cm$^{\text{2}}$V$^{\text{-1}}$s$^{\text{-1}}$ at
300 K for (B, Mn)As with a Mn concentration of about 3.7%, which is three
orders of magnitude larger than the hole mobility of 4
cm$^{\text{2}}$V$^{\text{-1}}$s$^{\text{-1}}$ at 300 K observed in the
experiment for (Ga, Mn)As. Our findings predict the emergence of a new family
of DMS, (B, Mn)X, and are expected to stimulate both experimental and
theoretical studies of the DMS with high T$_{\text{C}}$ and high mobilities.

<i>Jianchuan Liu, Xingchen Zhang, Yuzhi Zhang, Duo Zhang, Linfeng Zhang, Mohan Chen</i>
<p>We develop an attention-based deep-learning inter-atomic potential (the
DPA-Semi model) for 19 semiconductors ranging from group IIB to VIA, including
Si, Ge, SiC, BAs, BN, AlN, AlP, AlAs, InP, InAs, InSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, CdTe,
InTe, CdSe, ZnS, and CdS. In addition, independent deep potential models for
each semiconductor are prepared for detailed comparison. The training data of
the above models are obtained by performing density functional theory (DFT)
calculations with numerical atomic orbitals basis sets. We systematically
compare various properties of the solid and liquid phases of semiconductors
between the machine-learning models and DFT calculations. We conclude that the
DPA-Semi model owns an ab initio accuracy and substantially reduces the
computational costs when compared to DFT. In the future, the DPA-Semi model can
be regarded as a pre-trained model to study group IIB to VIA semiconductors
with ab initio accuracy.

<p>We report the electronic structures and transport properties of a chiral
crystal NbGe$_2$, which is a candidate for a coupled electron-phonon liquid.
The electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power of NbGe$_2$ exhibit clear
differences compared to those of NbSi2 even though both niobium ditetrelides
are isostructural and isoelectronic. We discuss the intriguing transport
properties of NbGe$_2$ based on a van Hove-type singularity in the density of
states. The analysis of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations measured by the field
modulation and magnetic torque methods reveals the detailed shape of the Fermi
surface of NbGe$_2$ by comparison with the results of energy band structure
calculations using a local density approximation. The electron and hole Fermi
surfaces of NbGe$_2$ split into two because of the anti-symmetric spin-orbit
interaction. The temperature dependence of quantum oscillations indicates that
the effective mass is isotropically enhanced in NbGe$_2$ due to strong
electron-phonon interaction.

<br>
<i>Yifan Li, Yihan Wu, Yuhang Han, Qujie Lyu, Hao Wu, Xiuying Zhang, Lei Shen</i>
<p>Most machine learning (ML) models in Materials Science are developed by
global geometric features, often falling short in describing localized
characteristics, like molecular adsorption on materials. In this study, we
introduce a local environment framework that extracts local features from
crystal structures to portray the environment surrounding specific adsorption
sites. Upon OC20 database (~20,000 3D entries), we apply our local environment
framework on several ML models, such as random forest, convolutional neural
network, and graph neural network. It is found that our framework achieves
remarkable prediction accuracy in predicting molecular adsorption energy,
significantly outperforming other examined global-environment-based models.
Moreover, the employment of this framework reduces data requirements and
augments computational speed, specifically for deep learning algorithms.
Finally, we directly apply our Local Environment ResNet (LERN) on a small
2DMatPedia database (~2,000 2D entries), which also achieves highly accurate
prediction, demonstrating the model transferability and remarkable data
efficiency. Overall, the prediction accuracy, data-utilization efficiency, and
transferability of our local-environment-based ML framework hold a promising
high applicability across a broad molecular adsorption field, such as catalysis
and sensor technologies.

<h3>Analytic continuation of multipoint correlation functions</h3>

<i>Anxiang Ge, Johannes Halbinger, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Jan von Delft, Fabian B. Kugler</i>
<p>Conceptually, the Matsubara formalism (MF), using imaginary frequencies, and
the Keldysh formalism (KF), formulated in real frequencies, give equivalent
results for systems in thermal equilibrium. The MF has less complexity and is
thus more convenient than the KF. However, computing dynamical observables in
the MF requires the analytic continuation from imaginary to real frequencies.
The analytic continuation is well-known for two-point correlation functions
(having one frequency argument), but, for multipoint correlators, a
straightforward recipe for deducing all Keldysh components from the MF
correlator had not been formulated yet. Recently, a representation of MF and KF
correlators in terms of formalism-independent partial spectral functions and
formalism-specific kernels was introduced by Kugler, Lee, and von Delft [Phys.
Rev. X 11, 041006 (2021)]. We use this representation to formally elucidate the
connection between both formalisms. We show how a multipoint MF correlator can
be analytically continued to recover all partial spectral functions and yield
all Keldysh components of its KF counterpart. The procedure is illustrated for
various correlators of the Hubbard atom.

<i>Dilimulati Aierken, Michael Bachmann</i>
<p>Canonical analysis has long been the primary analysis method for studies of
phase transitions. However, this approach is not sensitive enough if transition
signals are too close in temperature space. The recently introduced generalized
microcanonical inflection-point analysis method not only enables the systematic
identification and classification of transitions in systems of any size, but it
can also distinguish transitions that standard canonical analysis cannot
resolve. By applying this method to a generic coarse-grained model for
semiflexible polymers, we identify a mixed structural phase dominated by
secondary structures such as hairpins and loops that originates from a
bifurcation in the hyperspace spanned by inverse temperature and bending
stiffness. This intermediate phase, which is embraced by the well-known
random-coil and toroidal phases, is testimony to the necessity of balancing
entropic variability and energetic stability in functional macromolecules under
physiological conditions.

<p>We present a comprehensive study of the non-centrosymmetric semimetal
LaRhGe$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal evidence for electron-hole
compensation at low temperatures, resulting in a large magnetoresistance of
3000% at 1.8 K and 14 T. The carrier concentration is on the order of
$10^{21}\rm{/cm}^3$, higher than typical semimetals. We predict theoretically
the existence of $\textit{almost movable}$ Weyl nodal lines that are protected
by the tetragonal space group. We discover superconductivity for the first time
in this compound with a $T_{\text c}$ of 0.39(1) K and $B_{\rm{c}}(0)$ of
2.1(1) mT, with evidence from specific heat and transverse-field muon spin
relaxation ($\mu \rm{SR}$). LaRhGe$_3$ is a weakly-coupled type-I
superconductor, and we find no evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking in
our zero-field $\mu \rm{SR}$. We study the electrical transport in the normal
state and find an unusual $\sim T^{3}$ dependence at low temperature while
Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity measurements reveal a peak in the
same temperature range. We conclude that the transport properties of LaRhGe$_3$
in its normal state are strongly influenced by electron-phonon interactions.
Furthermore, we examine the temperature dependent Raman spectra of LaRhGe$_3$
and find that the lifetime of the lowest energy $A_1$ phonon is dominated by
phonon-electron scattering instead of anharmonic decay.

<h3>Adsorption isotherm and mechanism of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding to  polyelectrolyte</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11404" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11404</a>
<br>
<i>Sriteja Mantha, Alec Glisman, Decai Yu, Eric Wasserman, Scott Backer, Zhen-Gang Wang</i>
<p>Polyelectrolytes, such as polyacrylic acid (PAA), can effectively mitigate
$\mathrm{CaCO_3}$ scale formation. Despite their success as antiscalants, the
underlying mechanism of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding to polyelectrolyte chains
remains unresolved. Through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we
construct an adsorption isotherm of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ binding to sodium
polyacrylate ($\mathrm{NaPAA}$) and investigate the associated binding
mechanism. We find that the number of calcium ions adsorbed
$[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}_{ads}}]$ to the polymer saturates at moderately high
concentrations of free calcium ions $[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}_{aq}}]$ in the solution.
This saturation value is intricately connected with the binding modes
accessible to $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions when they bind to the polyelectrolyte
chain. We identify two dominant binding modes: the first involves binding to at
most two carboxylate oxygens on a polyacrylate chain, and the second, termed
the high binding mode, involves binding to four or more carboxylate oxygens. As
the concentration of free calcium ions $[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}_{aq}}]$ increases from
low to moderate levels, the polyelectrolyte chain undergoes a conformational
transition from an extended coil to a hairpin-like structure, enhancing the
accessibility to the high binding mode. At moderate concentrations of
$[\mathrm{Ca^{2+}_{aq}}]$, the high binding mode accounts for at least a third
of all binding events. The chain's conformational change and its consequent
access to the high binding mode is found to increase the overall
$\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ion binding capacity of the polyelectrolyte chain.

hosting more than one localized state at each side of a disordered SSH chain
with properly tuned long range hoppings. Inducing a non equilibrium steady
state across the chain, we probe the robustness of each phase and the fate of
the edge modes looking at the distribution of electrons along the chain and the
corresponding standard deviation in presence of different kinds of disorder

<h3>Massive spin-flip excitations in a $ν= 2$ quantum Hall ferromagnet</h3>

<i>S. Dickmann, P. S. Berezhnoy</i>
<p>Excitation with a massive spin reversal of the individual
skyrmion/antiskyrmion type is theoretically studied in a quantum Hall
ferromagnet, where the zero and first Landau levels are completely occupied
only by electrons with spins aligned strictly in the direction determined by
the magnetic field. The Wigner-Seitz parameter is not necessarily considered to
be small. The microscopic model in use is based on a reduced basic set of
quantum states [the so-called ''single-mode (single-exciton) approximation''],
which allows proper account to be taken for mixing of Landau levels, and
substantiating the equations of the classical $O(3)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model.
The calculated ''spin stiffness'' determines the exchange gap for creating a
pair of skyrmion and antiskyrmion. This gap is significantly smaller than the
doubled cyclotron energy and the characteristic electron-electron correlation
energy. Besides, the skyrmion--antiskyrmion creation gap is much smaller than
the energy of creation of a separated electron--exchange-hole pair calculated
in the limit case of a spin magnetoexciton corresponding to an infinitely large
2D momentum. At a certain magnetic field (related to the 2D electron density in
the case of fixed filling factor $\nu$), the gap vanishes, which presumably
points to a Stoner transition of the quantum Hall ferromagnet to a paramagnetic
phase.

<h3>Spin-orbit coupling in a half-filled $t_{2g}$ shell: the case of $5d^3$  K$_2$ReCl$_6$</h3>

<p>The half-filled $t_{2g}$ shell of the $t_{2g}^3$ configuration usually, in LS
coupling, hosts a S = 3/2 ground state with quenched orbital moment. This state
is not Jahn-Teller active. Sufficiently large spin-orbit coupling $\zeta$ has
been predicted to change this picture by mixing in orbital moment, giving rise
to a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion. In $5d^3$ K$_2$ReCl$_6$ we study the
electronic excitations using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and
optical spectroscopy. We observe on-site intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations below 2 eV
and corresponding overtones with two intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations on adjacent
sites, the Mott gap at 2.7 eV, $t_{2g}$-to-$e_g$ excitations above 3 eV, and
charge-transfer excitations at still higher energy. The intra-$t_{2g}$
excitation energies are a sensitive measure of $\zeta$ and Hund's coupling
$J_H$. The sizable value of $\zeta \approx$ 0.29 eV places K$_2$ReCl$_6$ into
the intermediate coupling regime, but $\zeta/J_H \approx 0.6$ is not
sufficiently large to drive a pronounced Jahn-Teller effect. We discuss the
ground state wavefunction in a Kanamori picture and find that the S = 3/2
multiplet still carries about 97 % of the weight. However, the finite admixture
of orbital moment allows for subtle effects. We discuss small
temperature-induced changes of the optical data and find evidence for a
lowering of the ground state by about 3 meV below the structural phase
transitions.

<h3>Two-step BEC coming from a temperature dependent energy gap</h3>

<br>
<i>Juan José Valencia Acevedo, Miguel Ángel Solís Atala</i>
<p>We report the effects on the thermodynamic properties of a 3D Bose gas caused
by a temperature dependent energy gap $\Delta (T)$ at the lower edge of the
energy spectrum of the particles constituting the Bose gas which behaves like
an ideal Bose gas when the gap is removed. Explicit formulae are given for the
critical temperature, the condensate fraction, the internal energy and the
isochoric specific heat, which are calculated for three different gaps that
abruptly go to zero at temperature $T_B$, as well as for the damped
counterparts whose drop to zero we have smoothed. In particular, for the
undamped BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) gap it is observed that the
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature $T_c$ is equal to that of
the ideal Bose gas $T_0$, for all $T_B \leq T_0$; surprisingly, the condensate
fraction presents two different filling rates of the ground state at $T_c =
T_0$ and at $T_B < T_0$; while the specific heat shows a finite jump at $T_c$
as well as a divergence at $T_B$. Three-dimensional infinite Bose gas results
are recovered when the temperature independent gap is either a constant or
equal to zero.

<br>
<i>Tobias M. R. Wolf, Chunli Huang</i>
<p>We report the successful adaptation of the quasi-boson approximation, a
technique traditionally employed in nuclear physics, to the analysis of the
two-dimensional electron gas. We show that the correlation energy estimated
from this approximation agrees closely with the results obtained from quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. Our methodology comprehensively incorporates the
exchange self-energy, direct scattering, and exchange scattering for a
particle-hole pair excited out of the mean-field groundstate within the
equation-of-motion framework. The linearization of the equation of motion leads
to a generalized-random-phase-approximation (gRPA) eigenvalue equation whose
spectrum indicates that the plasmon dispersion remains unaffected by exchange
effects, while the particle-hole continuum experiences a marked upward shift
due to the exchange self-energy. Notably, the plasmon mode retains its
collective nature within the particle-hole continuum, up to moderately short
wavelength ($q\sim 0.3 k_F$ at metallic density $r_s=4$). Using the gRPA
excitation spectrum, we calculate the zero-point energy of the quasi-boson
Hamiltonian, thereby approximating the correlation energy of the original
Hamiltonian. This research highlights the potential and effectiveness of
applying the quasi-boson approximation to the gRPA spectrum, a fundamental
technique in nuclear physics, to extended condensed matter systems.

<i>Shriram Chennakesavalu, Grant M. Rotskoff</i>
<p>Excitement at the prospect of using data-driven generative models to sample
configurational ensembles of biomolecular systems stems from the extraordinary
success of these models on a diverse set of high-dimensional sampling tasks.
Unlike image generation or even the closely related problem of protein
structure prediction, there are not currently data sources with sufficient
breadth to parameterize generative models for conformational ensembles. To
enable discovery, a fundamentally different approach to building generative
models is required: models should be able to propose rare, albeit physical,
conformations that may not arise in even the largest data sets. Here we
introduce a modular strategy to generate conformations based on ``backmapping''
from a fixed protein backbone that 1) maintains conformational diversity of the
side chains and 2) couples the side chain fluctuations using global information
about the protein conformation. Our model combines simple statistical models of
side chain conformations based on rotamer libraries with the now ubiquitous
transformer architecture to sample with atomistic accuracy. Together, these
ingredients provide a strategy for rapid data acquistion and hence a crucial
ingredient for scalable physical simulation with generative neural networks.

<p>Kagome materials have attracted enormous research interest recently owing to
its diverse topological phases and manifestation of electronic correlation due
to its inherent geometric frustration. Here, we report the electronic structure
of a new distorted kagome metal NdTi3Bi4 using a combination of angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two at bands which are found to
originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution
from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove
singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the
Fermi level EF. In addition, the presence of a surface Dirac cone at the G
point and a linear Dirac-like state at the K point with its Dirac node lying
very close to the EF indicates its topological nature. Our findings reveal
NdTi3Bi4 as a potential material to understand the interplay of topology,
magnetism, and electron correlation.

<p>Ultraclean graphene at charge neutrality hosts a quantum critical Dirac fluid
of interacting electrons and holes. Interactions profoundly affect the charge
dynamics of graphene, which is encoded in the properties of its collective
modes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The group velocity and lifetime of
SPPs have a direct correspondence with the reactive and dissipative parts of
the tera-Hertz (THz) conductivity of the Dirac fluid. We succeeded in tracking
the propagation of SPPs over sub-micron distances at femto-second (fs) time
scales. Our experiments uncovered prominent departures from the predictions of
the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The deviations are particularly strong
when the densities of electrons and holes are approximately equal. Our imaging
methodology can be used to probe the electromagnetics of quantum materials
other than graphene in order to provide fs-scale diagnostics under
near-equilibrium conditions.

<br>
<i>Keisuke Yoshida, Hirofumi Wada</i>
<p>We investigate the morphology and mechanics of a naturally curved elastic
arch loaded at its center and frictionally supported at both ends on a flat,
rigid substrate. Through systematic numerical simulations, we classify the
observed behaviors of the arch into three distinct types of configurations in
terms of the arch geometry and the coefficient of static friction with the
substrate. A linear theory is developed based on a planar elastica model
combined with Amontons-Coulomb's frictional law, which quantitatively explains
the numerically constructed phase diagram. The snapping transition of a loaded
arch in a sufficiently large indentation regime, which involves a discontinuous
force jump, is numerically observed. The proposed model problem allows a fully
analytical investigation and demonstrates a rich variety of mechanical
behaviors owing to the interplay between elasticity, geometry, and friction.
This study provides a basis for understanding more common but complex systems,
such as a cylindrical shell subjected to a concentrated load and simultaneously
supported by frictional contact with surrounding objects.

<br>
<i>L. N. Jiang, B. Y. Chi, W. Z. Chen, X. F. Han</i>
<p>Quantum-well resonance is achieved through partial confinement in magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs), which provides a more concise core structure and
additional degree of freedom to regulate quantum-well levels. Using
Al/Fe/MgO/Fe/Al and Fe/Al/Fe/MgO/Fe/Al/Fe MTJs as examples, via
first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the partial confinement of
{\Delta}1 electron at Al/Fe interface and the full confinement at Fe/MgO
interface combine to produce quantum-well resonances in Fe. The quantum-well
levels of Fe can be periodically adjusted by two degrees of freedom: Fe and Al
thickness. The oscillation period obtained from conductance is 2.13 ML Fe (8 ML
Al), in agreement with 2.25 ML Fe (8.33 ML Al) calculated by bcc-Fe (fcc-Al)
band. The combination of long and short periods enables quantum-well levels to
be finely adjusted, yielding an ultrahigh optimistic TMR effect of 160000 %.
Our results open the way for the design and application of quantum-well
resonances in spintronics devices.

<p>EuCd2As2 was theoretically predicted to be a minimal model of Weyl semimetals
with a single pair of Weyl points in the ferromagnet state. However, the
heavily p-doped EuCd2As2 crystals in previous experiments prevent direct
identification of the semimetal hypothesis. Here we present a comprehensive
magneto-transport study of high-quality EuCd2As2 crystals with ultralow bulk
carrier density (10^13 cm-3). In contrast to the general expectation of a Weyl
semimetal phase, EuCd2As2 shows insulating behavior in both antiferromagnetic
and ferromagnetic states as well as surface-dominated conduction from band
bending. Moreover, the application of a dc bias current can dramatically
modulate the resistance by over one order of magnitude, and induce a periodic
resistance oscillation due to the geometric resonance. Such nonlinear transport
results from the highly nonequilibrium state induced by electrical field near
the band edge. Our results suggest an insulating phase in EuCd2As2 and put a
strong constraint on the underlying mechanism of anomalous transport properties
in this system.

<p>The interplay of electron correlations and topological phases gives rise to
various exotic phenomena including fractionalization, excitonic instability,
and axionic excitation. Recently-discovered transition-metal pentatellurides
can reach the ultra-quantum limit in low magnetic fields and serve as good
candidates for achieving such a combination. Here, we report evidences of
density wave and metal-insulator transition in HfTe5 induced by intense
magnetic fields. Using the nonlinear transport technique, we detect a distinct
nonlinear conduction behavior in the longitudinal resistivity within the a-c
plane, corresponding to the formation of a density wave induced by magnetic
fields. In high fields, the onset of the nonlinear conduction in the Hall
resistivity indicates an impurity-pinned magnetic freeze-out as the possible
origin of the insulating behavior. These frozen electrons can be gradually
re-activated into mobile states above a threshold electric field. These
experimental evidences call for further investigations into the underlying
mechanism for the bulk quantum Hall effect and field-induced phase transtions
in pentatellurides.

<p>The thermal Hall effect in magnetic insulators has been considered a powerful
method for examining the topological nature of charge-neutral quasiparticles
such as magnons. Yet, unlike the kagome system, the triangular lattice has
received less attention for studying the thermal Hall effect because the scalar
spin chirality cancels out between adjacent triangles. However, such
cancellation cannot be perfect if the triangular lattice is distorted, which
could open the possibility of a non-zero thermal Hall effect. Here, we report
that the trimerized triangular lattice of multiferroic hexagonal manganite
YMnO$_3$ produces a highly unusual thermal Hall effect due to topological spin
fluctuations with the additional intricacy of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction under an applied magnetic field. We conclude the thermal Hall
conductivity arises from the system's topological nature of spin fluctuations.
Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the thermal Hall conductivity is
also related in this material to the splitting of the otherwise degenerate two
chiralities, left and right, of its 120$^{\circ}$ magnetic structure. Our
result is one of the most unusual cases of topological physics due to this
broken $Z_2$ symmetry of the chirality in the supposedly paramagnetic state of
YMnO$_3$, with strong topological spin fluctuations. These new mechanisms in
this important class of materials are crucial in exploring new thermal Hall
physics and exotic excitations.

<p>Josephson tunneling in twisted cuprate junctions provides a litmus test for
the pairing symmetry, which is fundamental for understanding the microscopic
mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. This issue is rekindled by
experimental advances in van der Waals stacking and the proposal of an emergent
d+id-wave. So far, all experiments have been carried out on
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) with double CuO$_2$ planes but show
controversial results. Here, we investigate junctions made of
Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6+y}$ (Bi-2201) with single CuO$_2$ planes. Our
on-site cold stacking technique ensures uncompromised crystalline quality and
stoichiometry at the interface. Junctions with carefully calibrated twist
angles around 45{\deg} show strong Josephson tunneling and conventional
temperature dependence. Furthermore, we observe standard Fraunhofer diffraction
patterns and integer Fiske steps in a junction with a twist angle of
45.0$\pm$0.2{\deg}. Together, these results pose strong constraints on the d or
d+id-wave pairing and suggest an indispensable isotropic pairing component.

<p>Powder metallurgy with hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP) is an advanced
manufacturing process that is envisioned to replace forging for heavy nuclear
components, including the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). But PM-HIP products
must at least demonstrate comparable irradiation tolerance than forgings in
order to be qualified for nuclear applications. The objective of this study is
to directly compare PM-HIP to forged SA508 Grade 3 Class 1 low-alloy RPV steel
at two neutron irradiation conditions: ~0.5-1.0 displacements per atom (dpa) at
~270C and ~370C. PM-HIP SA508 experiences greater irradiation hardening and
embrittlement (total elongation) than forged SA508. However, uniform elongation
and approximate toughness are comparable across all irradiated materials,
suggesting irradiated PM-HIP SA508 exhibits superior ductility at maximum
load-bearing capacity. The irradiation hardening mechanism is linked to
composition rather than fabrication method. Since PM-HIP SA508 has higher Mn
and Ni concentration, it is more susceptible to irradiation-induced nucleation
of Mn-Ni-Si-P (MNSP) nanoprecipitates and dislocation loops, which both
contribute to hardening. Conversely, the forged material nucleates fewer MNSPs,
causing dislocation loops to control irradiation hardening. These results show
promise for the irradiation performance of PM-HIP SA508 and can motivate future
nuclear code qualification of PM-HIP fabrication for RPVs.

<i>Thomas M. Henderson, Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Guo P. Chen, Gustavo E. Scuseria</i>
<p>It is usually asserted that physical Hamiltonians for fermions must contain
an even number of fermion operators. This is indeed true in electronic
structure theory. However, when the Jordan-Wigner transformation is used to map
spin Hamiltonians to Hamiltonians of spinless fermions, terms which contain an
odd number of fermion operators may appear. The resulting fermionic Hamiltonian
thus does not have number parity symmetry, and requires wave functions which do
not have this symmetry either. In this work, we discuss the extension of
standard Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to the number-parity--nonconserving
case. These ideas had appeared in the literature before but, perhaps for lack
of practical application, had to the best of our knowledge never been applied.
We also show how using these unusual mean-field states can provide significant
improvements when studying the Jordan-Wigner transformation of chemically
relevant spin Hamiltonians.

<i>Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu</i>
<p>We theoretically examine the finite-temperature spectral function of Fermi
polarons in three dimensions, by using a self-consistent many-body $T$-matrix
theory in real frequency. In comparison with the previous results from a
non-self-consistent many-body $T$-matrix approach, we show that the treatment
of self-consistency in the impurity Green function leads to notable changes in
almost all the dynamical quantities, including the vertex function, impurity
self-energy and spectral function. Eventually, it gives rise to quantitatively
different predictions for the measurable radio-frequency spectrum and Raman
spectrum at finite temperature. Using the recent spectroscopic measurements as
a benchmark, we find that the self-consistent many-body $T$-matrix theory
somehow provides a better explanation for the experimental data. The notable
difference in the predictions from the non-self-consistent and self-consistent
theories suggests that more accurate theoretical descriptions are needed, in
order to fully account for the current spectroscopic observations on Fermi
polarons.

<br>
<i>Rico Pohle, Youhei Yamaji, Masatoshi Imada</i>
<p>The quantum antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice offers an archetypal
frustrated system, which potentially realizes a quantum spin liquid
characterized by the absence of standard spontaneous symmetry breaking even at
zero temperature, unusually as an isotropic 3D system. Despite tremendous
progress in the literature, however, the nature of the ground state of the
fully quantum-mechanical spin Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice still
remains elusive. Here, we show that an unconventional type of quantum spin
liquid is born out from the pyrochlore system after the self-organized
dimensional reduction leading to confined states in 2D layers. This conclusion
is obtained from state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations at
zero temperature. Quantum spin liquids triggered by the emergent dimensional
reduction is an unexplored route of the spin-liquid formation. The dimensional
reduction from 3D to 2D is a consequence of a conventional spontaneous symmetry
breaking, while the resultant decoupling of layers enables the emergence of a
2D quantum spin liquid that is adiabatically disconnected from trivial product
states and exhibits strong quantum entanglement. The stabilized quantum spin
liquid exhibits an algebraic decay of correlations and vanishing excitation gap
in the thermodynamic limit. The wave-function structure supports the
fractionalization of the spin into spinons. This spin-liquid ground state
persists in the presence of spin-orbit interactions, which expands the
possibilities of realizing quantum spin liquids in real pyrochlore-structured
materials.

<br>
<i>Soonhyun Kwon, Bohm-Jung Yang</i>
<p>Understanding the relationship between quantum geometry and topological
invariants is a central problem in the study of topological states. In this
work, we establish the relationship between the quantum metric and the Euler
curvature in two-dimensional systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$
symmetry satisfying $I^2_{ST}=+1$. As $I_{ST}$ symmetry imposes the reality of
the wave function with vanishing Berry curvature, the well-known inequality
between the quantum metric and the Berry curvature is not meaningful in this
class of systems. We find that the non-abelian quantum geometric tensor of two
real bands exhibits an intriguing inequality between the off-diagonal Berry
curvature and the quantum metric, which in turn gives the inequality between
the quantum volume and the Euler invariant. Moreover, we show that the
saturation condition of the inequality is deeply related to the ideal condition
for Euler bands, which provides a criterion for the stability of fractional
topological phases in interacting Euler bands. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of the quantum geometry as a powerful tool for characterizing
symmetry-protected topological states and their interaction effect.

<p>We carry out a microscopic study of a vortex lattice in a strongly
correlated, type-II, d-wave superconductor(SC) using Bogoliubov de Gennes (BDG)
formalism. In weak-coupling theory, commonly accepted truism is that a vortex
binds to impurity. We demonstrate that in unconventional SCs, the binding of
vortex to an impurity depends on relevant parameters. In particular, we
illustrate such dependency on the sign of impurity, i.e. attractive or
repulsive, as well as doping. We emphasize that this seemingly unanticipated
behavior arises from strong correlation effects and is absent in weak coupling
descriptions.

<p>Kondo impurities provide a nontrivial probe to unravel the character of the
excitations of a quantum spin liquid. In the S=1/2 Kitaev model on the
honeycomb lattice, Kondo impurities embedded in the spin-liquid host can be
screened by itinerant Majorana fermions via gauge-flux binding. Here, we report
experimental signatures of metallic-like Kondo screening at intermediate
temperatures in the Kitaev honeycomb material {\alpha}-RuCl3 with dilute Cr3+
(S=3/2) impurities. The static magnetic susceptibility, the muon Knight shift,
and the muon spin-relaxation rate all feature logarithmic divergences, a
hallmark of a metallic Kondo effect. Concurrently, the linear coefficient of
the magnetic specific heat is large in the same temperature regime, indicating
the presence of a host Majorana metal. This observation opens new avenues for
exploring uncharted Kondo physics in insulating quantum magnets.

<p>Topological invariants, including the Chern numbers, can topologically
classify parameterized Hamiltonians. We find that topological invariants can be
properly defined and calculated even if the parameter space is discrete, which
is done by geodesic interpolation in the classifying space. We specifically
present the interpolation protocol for the Chern numbers, which can be directly
generalized to other topological invariants. The protocol generates a highly
efficient algorithm for numerical calculation of the second and higher Chern
numbers, by which arbitrary precision can be achieved given the values of the
parameterized Hamiltonians on a coarse grid with a fixed resolution in the
parameter space. Our findings also open up opportunities to study topology in
finite-size systems where the parameter space can be naturally discrete.

<p>The spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice is
geometrically frustrated, which is expected to promote the formation of
many-body quantum entangled states. The most sought-after among these is the
quantum spin liquid phase, but magnetic analogs of liquid, solid, and
supersolid phases may also occur, producing fractional plateaus in the
magnetization. Here, we investigate the experimental realization of these
predicted phases in the Kagome material YCu3(OD)6+xBr3-x (x=0.5). By combining
thermodynamic and Raman spectroscopic techniques, we provide evidence for
fractionalized spinon excitations and observe the emergence of a 1/9
magnetization plateau. These observations establish YCu3(OD)6+xBr3-x as a model
material for exploring the 1/9 plateau phase.

<p>Antiferromagnetic (AF) topological materials offer a fertile ground to
explore a variety of quantum phenomena such as axion magnetoelectric dynamics
and chiral Majorana fermions. To realize such intriguing states, it is
essential to establish a direct link between electronic states and topology in
the AF phase, whereas this has been challenging because of the lack of a
suitable materials platform. Here we report the experimental realization of the
AF topological-insulator phase in NdBi. By using micro-focused angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered contrasting surface electronic states
for two types of AF domains; the surface having the out-of-plane component in
the AF-ordering vector displays Dirac-cone states with a gigantic energy gap,
whereas the surface parallel to the AF-ordering vector hosts gapless Dirac
states despite the time-reversal-symmetry breaking. The present results
establish an essential role of combined symmetry to protect massless Dirac
fermions under the presence of AF order and widen opportunities to realize
exotic phenomena utilizing AF topological materials.

<h3>Nonequilibrium protection effect and spatial localization of  noise-induced fluctuations under gas flow scattering on partially penetrable  obstacle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11658</a>
<br>
<i>S.P. Lukyanets, O.V. Kliushnichenko</i>
<p>We consider a nonequilibrium transition that leads to the formation of
nonlinear steady-state structures due to the gas flow scattering on a partially
penetrable obstacle. The resulting nonequilibrium steady state (NESS)
corresponds to a two-domain gas structure attained at certain critical
parameters. We use a simple mean-field model of the driven lattice gas with
ring topology to demonstrate that this transition is accompanied by the
emergence of local invariants related to a complex composed of the obstacle and
its nearest gas surrounding, which we refer to as obstacle edges. These
invariants are independent of the main system parameters and behave as local
first integrals, at least qualitatively. As a result, the complex becomes
insensitive to the noise of external driving field within the overcritical
domain. The emerged invariants describe the conservation of the number of
particles inside the obstacle and strong temporal synchronization or
correlation of gas states at obstacle edges. Such synchronization guarantees
the equality to zero of the total edge current at any time. The robustness
against external drive fluctuations is shown to be accompanied by strong
spatial localization of induced gas fluctuations near the domain wall
separating the depleted and dense gas phases. Such a behavior can be associated
with nonequilibrium protection effect and synchronization of edges. The
transition rates between different NESSs are shown to be different. The
relaxation rates from one NESS to another take complex and real values in the
sub- and overcritical regimes, respectively. The mechanism of these transitions
is governed by the generation of shock waves at the back side of the obstacle.
In the subcritical regime, these solitary waves are generated sequentially many
times, while only a single excitation is sufficient to rearrange the system
state in the overcritical regime.

<p>The determination of material crystal structures has long been a central
focus in disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and materials science. In this
study, we introduce an efficient crystal structure prediction method that
combines physics-inspired heuristics with advanced deep learning models,
utilizing extensive quantum mechanics material databases and experimental data.
By incorporating both enthalpy of formation and synthesizability, our approach
enables more accurate predictions of crystal structures that exhibit structural
stability and are more likely to be successfully synthesized in experiments. In
parallel, we integrate intelligent optimization algorithms to enhance the
model's efficiency in searching for potential structures within the vast
chemical space. This comprehensive approach, which merges advanced deep
learning models with optimization algorithms while considering factors such as
thermodynamic stability and synthesizability, holds significant promise for
substantially improving the predictive performance of crystal structures.

<h3>Precursors to Topological Phase Transition in Topological Ladders</h3>

<i>Seungju Han, Mahn-Soo Choi</i>
<p>We study the coupling of two topologcal subsystems in distinct topological
states, and show that it leads to a precursor behavior of the topological phase
transition in the overall system. This behavior is solely determined by the
symmetry classes of the subsystem Hamiltonians and coupling terms, and is
marked by the persistent existence of subgap states within the bulk energy gap.
By investigating the critical current of Josephson junctions involving
topological superconductors, we also illustrate that such subgap states play
crucial roles in physical properties of nanoscale devices or materials.

<h3>Emergence of new topological gapless phases in the modified  square-lattice Kitaev model</h3>

<br>
<i>Jihyeon Park, Gun Sang Jeon</i>
<p>We investigate emergent topological gapless phases in the square-lattice
Kitaev model with additional hopping terms. In the presence of nearest-neighbor
hopping only, the model is known to exhibit gapless phases with two topological
gapless points. When the strength of the newly added next-nearest-neighbor
hopping is smaller than a certain value, qualitatively the same phase diagram
persists. We find that further increase of the extra hopping results in a new
topological phase with four gapless points. We construct a phase diagram to
clarify the regions of emergent topological gapless phases as well as
topologically trivial ones in the space of the chemical potential and the
next-nearest-neighbor hopping strength. We examine the evolution of the gapless
phases in the energy dispersions of the bulk as the chemical potential varies.
The topological properties of the gapless phases are characterized by the
winding numbers of the present gapless points. We also consider the ribbon
geometry to examine the corresponding topological edge states. It is revealed
that Majorana-fermion edge modes exist as flat bands in topological gapless
phases. We also perform the analytical calculation as to Majorana-fermion
zero-energy modes and discuss its implications on the numerical results.

<h3>Quenched disorder and instability control dynamic fracture in three  dimensions</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuri Lubomirsky, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<p>Materials failure in 3D still poses basic challenges. We study 3D brittle
crack dynamics using a phase-field approach, where Gaussian quenched disorder
in the fracture energy is incorporated. Disorder is characterized by a
correlation length $R$ and strength $\sigma$. We find that the mean crack
velocity $v$ is bounded by a limiting velocity, which is smaller than the
homogeneous material's prediction and decreases with $\sigma$. It emerges from
a dynamic renormalization of the fracture energy with increasing crack driving
force $G$, resembling a critical point, due to an interplay between a 2D
branching instability and disorder. At small $G$, the probability of localized
branching on a scale $R$ is super-exponentially small. With increasing $G$ this
probability quickly increases, leading to misty fracture surfaces, yet the
associated extra dissipation remains small. As $G$ is further increased,
branching-related lengthscales become dynamic and persistently increase,
leading to hackle-like structures and to a macroscopic contribution to the
fracture surface. The latter dynamically renormalizes the actual fracture
energy until eventually any increase in $G$ is balanced by extra fracture
surface, with no accompanying increase in $v$. Finally, branching width reaches
the system's thickness such that 2D symmetry is statistically restored. Our
findings are consistent with a broad range of experimental observations.

<h3>Tailored Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functionals for improved band gap  predictions in Zn monochalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11702" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11702</a>
<br>
<i>Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Namitha Anna Koshi, Seung-Cheol Lee</i>
<p>Zinc monochalcogenides, including ZnO, ZnS and ZnSe, are crucial for various
applications in optoelectronics and catalysis due to their exceptional
optoelectronic properties. However, accurately predicting their electronic
structures, especially the band gap and energy levels of Zn 3d states, remains
a challenge. Traditional density functional theory (DFT) approaches, including
local density and gradient-corrected approximations (LDA or GGA), often
significantly underestimate these properties compared to experimental values.
Advanced methods such as the GW approximation and DFT+U have been used to
resolve these discrepancies, but they involve high computational costs or
require seemingly unphysical parameters. This study focuses on a modified
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional with the aim of
more efficient prediction of the band gaps in zinc monochalcogenides. Unlike
previous approaches that require large negative U values for O p orbitals, our
method provides a more transparent solution by directly changing the PBE
functional. We demonstrate improved predictions of the electronic and optical
properties of zinc monochalcogenides that closely align with experimental data,
addressing a significant challenge in the computational study of these
materials.

<p>We show that interlayer charge transfer in 2D materials can be driven by an
in-plane electric field, giving rise to electrical multipole generation in
linear and second order of in-plane field. The linear and nonlinear effects
have quantum geometric origins in the Berry curvature and quantum metric
respectively, defined in extended parameter spaces characteristic of layered
materials. We elucidate their symmetry characters, and demonstrate sizable
dipole and quadrupole polarizations respectively in twisted bilayers and
trilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Furthermore, we show that the
effect is strongly enhanced during the topological phase transition tuned by
interlayer translation. The effects point to a new electric control on layer
quantum degree of freedom.

<i>Anderson L. R. Barbosa, Luis M. Canonico, Jose H. Garía, Tatiana G. Rappoport</i>
<p>We investigate a generalized multi-orbital tight-binding model on a
triangular lattice, a system prevalent in a wide range of two-dimensional
materials, and particularly relevant for simulating transition metal
dichalcogenide monolayers. We show that the interplay between spin-orbit
coupling and different symmetry-breaking mechanisms leads to the emergence of
four distinct topological phases [Eck, P., \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B, 107
(11), 115130 (2023)]. Remarkably, this interplay also triggers the orbital Hall
effect with distinguished characteristics. Furthermore, by employing the
Landauer-B\"uttiker formula, we establish that in the orbital Hall insulating
phase, the orbital angular momentum is carried by edge states present in
nanoribbons with specific terminations. We also show that, as expected, they do
not have topological protection against the disorder of the edge states
belonging to a first-order topological insulator.

<i>Yulian Honchar, Bertrand Berche, Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna</i>
<p>We progress finite-size scaling in systems with free boundary conditions
above their upper critical dimension, where in the thermodynamic limit critical
scaling is described by mean-field theory. Recent works show that the
correlation length is not bound by the system's physical size, a belief that
long held sway. Instead, two scaling regimes can be observed -- at the critical
and pseudo-critical temperatures. We demonstrate that both are manifest for
free boundaries. We use numerical simulations of the $d=5$ Ising model to
analyse the magnetization, susceptibility, magnetization Fourier modes and the
partition function zeros. While some of the response functions hide the dual
finite-size scaling, the precision enabled by the analysis of Lee-Yang zeros
allows this be brought to the fore. In particular, finite-size scaling of
leading zeros at the pseudocritical point confirms recent predictions coming
from correlations exceeding system size. This paper is dedicated to Jaroslav
Ilnytskyi on the occasion of his 60th birthday.

<p>We use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a new form of spectroscopy,
called quench spectroscopy, which probes the low-energy excitations of a
many-body system. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of
the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial
spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion
relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic
couplings. We observe qualitatively different behaviors between the two cases
that result from the long-range nature of the interactions, and the frustration
inherent in the antiferromagnet. In particular, the ferromagnet exhibits
elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves. In the anti-ferromagnet,
spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities.
Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the
excitation spectrum of a many-body system.

<br>
<i>Ludvig Lizana</i>
<p>The most common gene regulation mechanism is when a protein binds to a
regulatory sequence to change RNA transcription. However, these sequences are
short relative to the genome length, so finding them poses a challenging search
problem. This paper presents two mathematical frameworks capturing different
aspects of this problem. First, we study the interplay between diffusional flux
through a target where the searching proteins get sequestered on DNA far from
the target because of non-specific interactions. From this model, we derive a
simple formula for the optimal protein-DNA unbinding rate, maximizing the
particle flux. Second, we study how the flux flows through a target on a single
antenna with variable length. Here, we identify a non-trivial logarithmic
correction to the linear behavior relative to the target size proposed by
Smoluchowski's flux formula.

<br>
<i>Mykola Tasinkevych, Artem Ryabov</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of a chemical nanoswimmer in a ratchet potential, which
is periodically rocked in the transverse direction. As a result of the
mechanochemical coupling, the self-propulsion velocity becomes force-dependent
and particle trajectories are rectified in the direction of the ratchet
modulation. The magnitude and direction of the nanoswimmer mean velocity depend
upon both the rocking amplitude and the frequency. Remarkably, for frequencies
larger than the inverse correlation time of the rotational diffusion, the
velocity exhibits oscillatory behaviour as a function of the amplitude and the
frequency with multiple reversals of the sign. These findings suggest that
mechanochemical coupling can be utilized for controlling the motion of
chemically active particles at the nanoscale.

<p>We study a superlattice formed by tunnel-coupled identical antidots
periodically situated in a two-dimensional topological insulator placed in a
magnetic field. The superlattice spectrum can be controlled by gate electrodes
or by changing the magnetic flux through the antidots. We demonstrate that a
topologically protected qubit appears at the boundary between two regions with
different fluxes. The qubit properties depend on the value of the flux jump on
the boundary and can be controlled by the gate voltage. We derive the effective
Hamiltonian of such a qubit and analyze the dependence of its properties on the
main parameters of the superlattice: the tunnel coupling between antidots, and
the probability of jumps with the spin flip.

<p>Hypothesis: Slippery Omniphobic Covalently Attached Liquids (SOCAL) have been
proposed for making omnirepellent thin films of self-assembled dimethylsiloxane
polymer brushes grafted from silica surfaces. Smooth and flat at very small
scale, these fluid surfaces could exhibit a more complex multiscale structure
though showing very weak contact angle hysteresis (less than
5{\textdegree}).Experiment: In this work, coatings were deposited on glass
surfaces from an acidic dimethoxydimethylsilane solution under carefully
controlled relative humidity. Ellipsometry mapping was used to analyze the
surface structuration with nanometric thickness sensitivity. The sliding
properties were determined using a drop shape analyzer with a tilting device,
and chemical analyses of the coatings were performed using on-surface
techniques (XPS, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy).Findings: Coated materials possessed an
unexpected surface structure with multiscale semispherical-like features, which
surprisingly, did not increase the contact angle hysteresis. A careful study of
some parameters of the coating process and the related evolution of the surface
properties allowed us to propose a new model of the chemical organization of
the polymer to support this remarkable liquid-like behavior. These structures
are made of end-grafted strongly adsorbed Guiselin brushes with
humidity-dependent thickness: the higher the humidity, the thinner and the more
slippery the coating.

<h3>Remarks on Statistical mechanics of a moving system</h3>

<br>
<i>Jinwu Ye</i>
<p>In the realm of statistical mechanics, it has been established that there is
no distinction between the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles in the
thermodynamic limit. However, this paradigm may alter when addressing
statistical mechanics in the context of a moving sample with a velocity $ v $.
Our investigation reveals significant disparities between the two ensembles
when considering relativistic effects up to the order of $ (v/c)^2 $. While the
temperature remains the same in the former, it experiences an increase in the
latter. If the system undergoes a finite-temperature phase transition, the
critical temperature decreases in the co-moving frame of the latter ensemble.
The implications of these findings on the thermodynamic zeroth to the third
laws and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis are analysed. The potential
for the experimental detection of these novel effects in condensed matter
systems are discussed.

<br>
<i>Paul Robin</i>
<p>Electrostatic correlations between ions dissolved in water are known to
impact their transport properties in numerous ways, from conductivity to ion
selectivity. The effects of these correlations on the solvent itself remain,
however, much less clear. In particular, the addition of salt has been
consistently reported to affect the solution's viscosity -- but most modelling
attempts fail to reproduce experimental data even at moderate salt
concentration. Here, we use an approach based on stochastic density functional
theory, which accurately captures charge fluctuations and correlations. We
derive a simple analytical expression for the viscosity correction in
concentrated electrolytes, by directly linking it to the liquid's structure
factor. Our prediction compares quantitatively to experimental data at all
temperatures and all salt concentrations up to the saturation limit. This
universal link between microscopic structure and viscosity allows to shed light
on the nanoscale dynamics of water and ions in highly concentrated and
correlated conditions.

<p>We experimentally investigate magnetization reversal curves for a GeTe
topological semimetal. In addition to the known lattice diamagnetic response,
we observe narrow magnetization loop in low fields, which should not be
expected for non-magnetic GeTe. The hysteresis is unusual, so the saturation
level is negative in positive fields, and the loop is passed clockwise, in
contrast to standard ferromagnetic behavior. The experimental hysteresis curves
can not be obtained from usual ferromagnetic ones by adding/subtracting of any
linear dependence, or even by considering several interacting magnetic phases.
The possibility of several phases is also eliminated by the remanence plots
technique (Henkel or {\delta}M plots). We explain our results as a direct
consequence of the correlation between ferroelectricity and spin-polarized
surface states in GeTe, similarly to magnetoelectric structures.

<p>Mott metal-insulator transitions possess electronic, magnetic, and structural
degrees of freedom promising next generation energy-efficient electronics. We
report a previously unknown, hierarchically ordered state during a Mott
transition and demonstrate correlated switching of functional electronic
properties. We elucidate in-situ formation of an intrinsic supercrystal in a
Ca2RuO4 thin film. Machine learning-assisted X-ray nanodiffraction together
with electron microscopy reveal multi-scale periodic domain formation at and
below the film transition temperature (TFilm ~ 200-250 K) and a separate
anisotropic spatial structure at and above TFilm. Local resistivity
measurements imply an intrinsic coupling of the supercrystal orientation to the
material's anisotropic conductivity. Our findings add an additional degree of
complexity to the physical understanding of Mott transitions, opening
opportunities for designing materials with tunable electronic properties.

<i>Van Dong Pham, Yi Pan, Steven C. Erwin, Stefan Fölsch</i>
<p>Cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy was employed in combination with
density-functional theory calculations to explore quantum dots made of In
adatoms on the InAs(110) surface. Each adatom adsorbs at a surface site
coordinated by one cation and two anions, and transfers one electron to the
substrate, creating an attractive quantum well for electrons in surface states.
We used the scanning-probe tip to assemble the positively charged adatoms into
precisely defined quantum dots exhibiting a bound state roughly 0.1 eV below
the Fermi level at an intrinsic linewidth of only ~4 meV, as revealed by
scanning tunneling spectroscopy. For quantum-dot dimers, we observed the
emergence of a bonding and an antibonding state with even and odd wave-function
character, respectively, demonstrating the capability to engineer
quasi-molecular electronic states. InAs(110) constitutes a promising platform
in this respect because highly perfect surfaces can be readily prepared by
cleavage and charged adatoms can be generated in-situ by the scanning-probe
tip.

<i>Rousan Debbarma, Athanasios Tsintzis, Markus Aspegren, Rubén Seoane Souto, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly Dick, Martin Leijnse, Claes Thelander</i>
<p>In this work, we manipulate the phase shift of a Josephson junction using a
parallel double quantum dot (QD). By employing a superconducting quantum
interference device, we determine how orbital hybridization and detuning affect
the current-phase relation in the Coulomb blockade regime. For weak
hybridization between the QDs, we find $\pi$ junction characteristics if at
least one QD has an unpaired electron. Notably the critical current is higher
when both QDs have an odd electron occupation. By increasing the inter-QD
hybridization the critical current is reduced, until eventually a $\pi$-0
transition occurs. A similar transition appears when detuning the QD levels at
finite hybridization. Based on a zero-bandwidth model, we argue that both cases
of phase-shift transitions can be understood considering an increased weight of
states with a double occupancy in the ground state and with the Cooper pair
transport dominated by local Andreev reflection.

<p>The out-of-equilibrium character of active particles, responsible for
accumulation at boundaries in confining domains, determines not-trivial effects
when considering escape processes. Non-monotonous behavior of exit times with
respect to tumbling rate (inverse of mean persistent time) appears, as a
consequence of the competing processes of exploring the bulk and accumulate at
boundaries. By using both 1D analytical results and 2D numerical simulations of
run-and-tumble particles with different behaviours at boundaries, we scrutinize
this very general phenomenon of active matter, evidencing the role of
accumulation at walls for the existence of optimal tumbling rates for fast
escapes.

dynamical properties, such as the stretching in the flow direction and
compression in the gradient direction, shear-induced alignment, and shear
viscosity. In the asymptotic limit of large activities and shear rates, the
power-law scaling exponents of these quantities differ significantly from those
of passive polymers. The chain's shear-induced stretching at a given shear rate
is reduced by active noise, and it displays a non-monotonic behavior, where an
initial polymer compression is followed by its stretching with increasing
active force.

<h3>Orbital Kerr effect and terahertz detection via the nonlinear Hall  effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11889</a>
<br>
<i>Diego Garcia Ovalle, Armando Pezo, Aurélien Manchon</i>
<p>We investigate the optical response induced by a d.c. current flowing in a
nonmagnetic material that lacks inversion symmetry. In this class of materials,
the flowing current experiences a nonlinear Hall effect and induces a
nonequilibrium orbital magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit
coupling. As a result, an orbital-driven Kerr effect arises that can be used to
probe not only the orbital magnetization, but also the nonlinear Hall effect.
In addition, in the long wavelength limit, the nonlinear Hall effect leads to a
rectification current that can be used to detect terahertz radiation. We apply
the theory to selected model systems, such as WTe$_2$ bilayer, as well as to
realistic materials, i.e., bulk Te and metallic superlattices. The
nonequilibrium orbital Kerr efficiencies obtained in these systems are
comparable to the largest values reported experimentally in GaAs and MoS$_2$,
exceeding the values reported in metals and suggesting a large terahertz
current responsivity.

<h3>Diffusion with two resetting points</h3>

<br>
<i>Pedro Julián Salgado, Leonardo Dagdug, Denis Boyer</i>
<p>We study the problem of a target search by a Brownian particle subject to
stochastic resetting to a pair of sites. The mean search time is minimized by
an optimal resetting rate which does not vary smoothly, in contrast with the
well-known single site case, but exhibits a discontinuous transition as the
position of one resetting site is varied, while keeping the initial position of
the particle fixed. The discontinuity vanishes at a \lq\lq liquid-gas" critical
point in the positions space. This critical point exists provided that the
relative weight of the further site is comprised in the interval
$[2.9028...,8.5603...]$. This setup can be mapped onto an intermittent search
problem with switching diffusion coefficients and represents a minimal model
for the study of distributed resetting.

<i>Yu-Sheng Huang, Saurav Islam, Yongxi Ou, Supriya Ghosh, Anthony Richardella, K. Andre Mkhoyan, Nitin Samarth</i>
<p>We report the molecular beam epitaxy of Bi_1-xSb_x thin films ($0 \leq x \leq
1$) on (0001) sapphire substrates using a thin (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ buffer layer.
Characterization of the films using reflection high energy diffraction, x-ray
diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron
microscopy reveals epitaxial growth of films of reasonable structural quality.
This is further confirmed via x-ray diffraction pole figures that determine the
epitaxial registry between the thin film and substrate. We further investigate
the microscopic structure of thin films via Raman spectroscopy, demonstrating
how the vibrational modes vary as the composition changes and discussing the
implications for the crystal structure. We also characterize the samples using
electrical transport measurements.

<h3>Multi-flavor quantum criticality</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Khansili, A. Bangura, R. D. McDonald, B. J. Ramshaw, A. Rydh, A. Shekhter</i>
<p>In a quantum critical metal, the electronic density of states, or
quasiparticle mass on the Fermi surface, is strongly enhanced through
electronic correlations. The density of states in the quantum critical
unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$, can be readily accessed in the normal
state because all energy scales are small. However, the experimental challenges
associated with large nuclear specific heat and long nuclear spin-lattice
relaxation times have impeded unveiling a more detailed physical picture. Here
we report an extensive thermal impedance spectroscopy study of CeCoIn$_5$ that
assesses the density of states in two independent ways, via the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate and via the specific heat. We establish that the
temperature- and magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice
relaxation rate is determined entirely by the energy-scale competition near the
quantum critical point. In particular, mass enhancement is cut off at finite
magnetic fields. However, the specific heat measurements reveal excess entropy
in addition to that associated with the density of states on the Fermi surface.
This excess entropy is direct thermodynamic evidence for a "second flavor" of
fluctuating boson in CeCoIn$_5$. The electronic nature of this excess entropy
is evidenced by its suppression in the superconducting state. We suggest such a
multi-flavour character for a broader class of quantum critical metals.

<h3>Phonon dynamics for light dark matter detection</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11930" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11930</a>
<br>
<i>Martí Raya-Moreno, Bradley J. Kavanagh, Lourdes Fàbrega, Riccardo Rurali</i>
<p>The search for low-mass dark matter (DM) goes in parallel with the
identification of new detection channels and the development of suitable
detectors. Detection of the resulting small energy depositions is challenging:
it requires extremely high sensitivity, only achievable by cryogenic thermal
detectors, which might be put to the limit. Understanding the processes which
can limit performances of these detectors can be thus crucial for evaluating
the feasibility of the proposed new detection schemes and to design the
detectors and tune their performance. In this paper we focus on a promising
detection scheme, the excitation of single optical phonons in polar materials,
to evaluate one of the possible limiting factors of cryogenic thermal
detectors, i.e. the phonon dynamics in the target/absorber. We present a
detailed theoretical analysis, within an entirely ab initio scheme, of the
downconversion and propagation processes undergone by optical phonons, created
by the interaction of a low-mass DM particle in an Al2O3 target, until they
reach the interface with a phonon Al collector. After a preliminary
methodological survey that reveals the limitations of any Relaxation Time
Approximation based method, we developed a 3D beyond-RTA phonon Monte Carlo
that allowed us to introduce the spatial dimension of the device and address
questions about impact of target size and scattering position. We analyse also
the effect of the phonon energy and wavevector and show that isotopes can,
perhaps counterintuitively, result in a larger heat flux by providing transport
channels of higher velocities, thus favoring detection. Our results suggest
that, though challenging, the direct detection of light DM via athermal phonon
generation appears feasible, and that the phonon downconversion followed by
quasi-ballistic propagation does not appear to be a major bottleneck in terms
of reducing the signal.

<h3>Spin Hall conductivity in Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ as an experimental test of  bulk-boundary correspondence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11933" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11933</a>
<br>
<i>Yongxi Ou, Wilson Yanez-Parreño, Yu-sheng Huang, Supriya Ghosh, Cüneyt Şahin, Max Stanley, Sandra Santhosh, Saurav Islam, Anthony Richardella, K. Andre Mkhoyan, Michael E. Flatté, Nitin Samarth</i>
<p>Bulk-boundary correspondence is a foundational principle underlying the
electronic band structure and physical behavior of topological quantum
materials. Although it has been rigorously tested in topological systems where
the physical properties involve charge currents, it remains unclear whether
bulk-boundary correspondence should also hold for non-conserved spin currents.
We study charge-to-spin conversion in a canonical topological insulator,
Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$, to address this fundamentally unresolved question. We use
spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements to accurately probe the
charge-to-spin conversion efficiency in epitaxial Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$~thin films
of high structural quality spanning the entire range of composition, including
both trivial and topological band structures, as verified using {\it in vacuo}
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. From these measurements, we deduce
the effective spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and find excellent agreement with
the values predicted by tight-binding calculations for the intrinsic SHC of the
bulk bands. These results provide strong evidence that the strong spin-orbit
entanglement of bulk states well below the Fermi energy connects directly to
the SHC in epitaxial Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$~films interfaced with a metallic
ferromagnet. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment points to
the generic value of analyses focused entirely on bulk properties, even for
topological systems involving non-conserved spin currents.

<h3>Point Processes and the Statistics of Cellular Neighborhoods in Simple  Multicellular Organisms</h3>

<br>
<i>Anand Srinivasan, Steph Hohn, Raymond E. Goldstein</i>
<p>Recent work on several distinct multicellular organisms has revealed a
hitherto unknown type of biological noise; rather than a highly regular
arrangement, cellular neighborhood volumes, obtained by Voronoi tessellations
of the cell locations, are broadly distributed and consistent with gamma
distributions. We propose an explanation for those observations in the case of
the alga $Volvox$, whose somatic cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix
(ECM) exported by cells. We show that the simplest models for stochastic ECM
generation in one and two dimensions are point processes whose Voronoi
tesselations are demonstrably governed by gamma distributions. These results
highlight a universal consequence of intrinsic biological noise on the
architecture of certain tissues.

<h3>Extreme heterogeneity in the microrheology of lamellar surfactant gels  analyzed with neural networks</h3>

<br>
<i>Owen Watts Moore, Conor Lewis, Thomas Ross, Thomas Andrew Waigh, Nickolay Korabel, Cesar Mendoza</i>
<p>The heterogeneity of the viscoelasticity of a lamellar gel network based on
cetyl-trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and ceto-stearyl alcohol was studied
using particle tracking microrheology. A recurrent neural network (RNN)
architecture was used for estimating the Hurst exponent, $H$, on small sections
of tracks of probe spheres moving with fractional Brownian motion. Thus dynamic
segmentation of tracks via neural networks was used in microrheology for the
first time and it is significantly more accurate than using mean square
displacements. An ensemble of 414 particles produces a mean squared
displacement (MSD) that is subdiffusive in time, $t$, with a power law of the
form $t^{0.74\pm0.02}$, indicating power law viscoelasticity. RNN analysis of
the probability distributions of $H$, combined with detailed analysis of the
time-averaged MSDs of individual tracks, revealed diverse diffusion processes
belied by the simple scaling of the ensemble MSD, such as caging phenomena,
which give rise to the complex viscoelasticity of lamellar gels.

<h3>Efficient Cooper Pair Splitting Without Coulomb Blockade</h3>

<br>
<i>E.S. Tikhonov, V.S. Khrapai</i>
<p>For the three-terminal NSN device with single-mode normal terminals and
without Coulomb blockade, we propose an approach which allows us to
consistently characterize the device operation as that of a Cooper pair
splitter in terms of scattering matrix elements as well as in terms of
measurable quantities. The obtained explicit expression for the splitting
probability notably contains the two-particle interference term not available
from conductance measurements. We show that splitting doesn't necessarily rely
on crossed Andreev reflection thus allowing for the unit efficiency at zero
energy. Our results imply that the current cross-correlator generally doesn't
provide definite measure of splitting.

<p>The measurement and manipulation of the coherent dynamics of excitonic states
constitute a forefront research challenge in semiconductor optics and in
quantum coherence-based protocols for optoelectronic technologies. Layered
semiconductors have emerged as an ideal platform for the study of exciton
dynamics with accessible and technologically relevant energy and time scales.
Here, we investigate the sub-picosecond exciton dynamics in a van-der-Waals
semiconductor upon quasi-resonant excitation, and achieve to single out an
incipient coherent excitonic state. Combining broadband transient reflectance
spectroscopy and simulations based on many-body perturbation theory, we reveal
a transient enhancement of the excitonic line intensity that originates from
the photoinduced coherent polarization that is phase-locked with the
interacting electromagnetic field. This finding allows us to define the
spectral signature of a coherent excitonic state and to experimentally track
the dynamical crossover from coherent to incoherent exciton, unlocking the
prospective optical control of an exciton population on the intrinsic
quantum-coherence timescale.

<p>Unbiased sources of true randomness are critical for the successful
deployment of stochastic unconventional computing schemes and encryption
applications in hardware. Leveraging nanoscale thermal magnetization
fluctuations provides an efficient and almost cost-free means of generating
truly random bitstreams, distinguishing them from predictable pseudo-random
sequences. However, existing approaches that aim to achieve randomness often
suffer from bias, leading to significant deviations from equal fractions of 0
and 1 in the bitstreams and compromising their inherent unpredictability. This
study presents a hardware approach that capitalizes on the intrinsic balance of
phase noise in an oscillator injection locked at twice its natural frequency,
leveraging the stability of this naturally balanced physical system. We
demonstrate the successful generation of unbiased and truly random bitstreams
through extensive experimentation. Our numerical simulations exhibit excellent
agreement with the experimental results, confirming the robustness and
viability of our approach.

<h3>The impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in charge-ordered systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Rodrigo A. Fontenele, Sebastião dos Anjos Sousa-Júnior, Tarik P. Cysne, Natanael C. Costa</i>
<p>We study the impact of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the stability
of charge-density wave (CDW) in systems with large electron-phonon coupling
(EPC). Here, the EPC is considered in the framework of the Holstein model at
the half-filled square lattice. We start obtaining the phase diagram of the
Rashba-Holstein model using the Hartree-Fock mean-field theory, and identifying
the boundaries of the CDW and Rashba metal phases. As our main result, we
notice that the RSOC disfavors the CDW phase, driving the system to a
correlated Rashba metal. Proceeding, we employ a cluster perturbation theory
(CPT) approach to investigate the phase diagram beyond the Hartree-Fock
approximation. The quantum correlations captured by CPT indicate that the RSOC
is even more detrimental to CDW than previously anticipated. That is, the
Rashba metal region is observed to be expanded in comparison to the mean-field
case. Additionally, we investigate pairing correlations, and the results
further strengthen the identification of critical points.

<h3>Machine-Learned Atomic Cluster Expansion Potentials for Fast and  Quantum-Accurate Thermal Simulations of Wurtzite AlN</h3>

<br>
<i>Guang Yang, Yuan-Bin Liu, Lei Yang, Bing-Yang Cao</i>
<p>Using the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework, we develop a machine
learning interatomic potential for fast and accurately modelling the phonon
transport properties of wurtzite aluminum nitride. The predictive power of the
ACE potential against density functional theory (DFT) is demonstrated across a
broad range of properties of w-AlN, including ground-state lattice parameters,
specific heat capacity, coefficients of thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and
harmonic phonon dispersions. Validation of lattice thermal conductivity is
further carried out by comparing the ACE-predicted values to the DFT
calculations and experiments, exhibiting the overall capability of our ACE
potential in sufficiently describing anharmonic phonon interactions. As a
practical application, we perform a lattice dynamics analysis using the
potential to unravel the effects of biaxial strains on thermal conductivity and
phonon properties of w-AlN, which is identified as a significant tuning factor
for near-junction thermal design of w-AlN-based electronics.

<h3>An on-chip platform for multi-degree-of-freedom control of  two-dimensional quantum and nonlinear materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Haoning Tang, Yiting Wang, Xueqi Ni, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Shanhui Fan, Eric Mazur, Amir Yacoby, Yuan Cao</i>
<p>Two-dimensional materials (2DM) and their derived heterostructures have
electrical and optical properties that are widely tunable via several
approaches, most notably electrostatic gating and interfacial engineering such
as twisting. While electrostatic gating is simple and has been ubiquitously
employed on 2DM, being able to tailor the interfacial properties in a similar
real-time manner represents the next leap in our ability to modulate the
underlying physics and build exotic devices with 2DM. However, all existing
approaches rely on external machinery such as scanning microscopes, which often
limit their scope of applications, and there is currently no means of tuning a
2D interface that has the same accessibility and scalability as electrostatic
gating. Here, we demonstrate the first on-chip platform designed for 2D
materials with in situ tunable interfacial properties, utilizing a
microelectromechanical system (MEMS). Each compact, cost-effective, and
versatile device is a standalone micromachine that allows voltage-controlled
approaching, twisting, and pressurizing of 2DM with high accuracy. As a
demonstration, we engineer synthetic topological singularities, known as
merons, in the nonlinear optical susceptibility of twisted hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN), via simultaneous control of twist angle and interlayer
separation. The chirality of the resulting moire pattern further induces a
strong circular dichroism in the second-harmonic generation. A potential
application of this topological nonlinear susceptibility is to create
integrated classical and quantum light sources that have widely and real-time
tunable polarization. Our invention pushes the boundary of available
technologies for manipulating low-dimensional quantum materials, which in turn
opens up the gateway for designing future hybrid 2D-3D devices for
condensed-matter physics, quantum optics, and beyond.

<h3>Topological Diagnosis of Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Chandan Setty, Fang Xie, Shouvik Sur, Lei Chen, Silke Paschen, Maia G. Vergniory, Jennifer Cano, Qimiao Si</i>
<p>The intersection of electronic topology and strong correlations offers a rich
platform to discover exotic quantum phases of matter and unusual materials. An
overarching challenge that impedes the discovery is how to diagnose strongly
correlated electronic topology. Here, we develop a framework to address this
outstanding question, and illustrate its power in the setting of electronic
topology in Mott insulators. Based on single-particle Green's functions, the
concept of a Green's function Berry curvature -- which is frequency dependent
-- is introduced. We apply this notion in a system that contains
symmetry-protected nodes in its noninteracting bandstructure; strong
correlations drive the system into a Mott insulating state, creating contours
in frequency-momentum space where the Green's function vanishes. The Green's
function Berry flux of such zeros is found to be quantized, and is as such
direct probe of the system's topology. Our framework allows for a systematic
search of strongly correlated topological materials with Green's function
topology.
