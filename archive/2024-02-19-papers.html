<h3>From hydrodynamics to dipolar colloids: modeling complex interactions  and self-organization with generalized potentials</h3>

<p>The self-organization of clusters of particles is a fundamental phenomenon
across various physical systems, including hydrodynamic and colloidal systems.
One example is that of dense spherical particles submerged in a fluid and
subjected to horizontal oscillations. The interaction of the particles with the
oscillating flow leads to the formation of one-particle-thick chains or
multiple-particle-wide bands. In this study, we model the hydrodynamic
interactions between such particles and parallel chains using simplified
potentials. We first focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between chains,
which we characterize using data from numerical simulations. Based on these
interactions, we propose a simplified model potential, called the Siren
potential, which combines the representative hydrodynamic interactions:
short-range attraction, mid-range repulsion, and long-range attraction. Through
one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, we successfully replicate the
characteristic patterns observed in hydrodynamic experiments and draw the phase
diagram for the model potential. We extend our analysis to two-dimensional
systems, introducing a dipole-capillary model potential that accounts for both
chain formation and Siren-like chain interactions. This potential is based on
colloidal particles at an interface, where chain formation is driven by an
external electric field inducing a dipole moment parallel to the interface in
each particle. The capillary force contributes the long-range attraction.
Starting with parallel chains, the patterns in the two-dimensional Monte Carlo
simulations of this colloidal system are similar to those observed in the
hydrodynamic experiments. Still, the model potentials help clarify the dynamic
behavior of the particles and chains due to the complex interactions
encountered in both hydrodynamic and colloidal systems, drawing parallels
between them.

<h3>Non-monotonous shear rate dependence of dielectric relaxation frequency  of a nematic liquid crystal revealed by rheo-dielectric spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11906</a>
<br>
<i>K. Anaswara Das, M. Praveen Kumar, Surajit Dhara</i>
<p>Dielectric relaxation of materials provides important information on the
polarisation dynamics at different time scales. We study the dielectric
relaxation of a nematic liquid crystal under steady rotational shear and
simultaneously measure the viscosity. The dielectric anisotropy of the nematic
is positive and the applied field is parallel to the velocity gradient
direction with a magnitude larger than the Freedericksz threshold field. The
complex dielectric constant as well as the effective viscosity decreases
rapidly with increasing shear rate. The dielectric relaxation frequency
exhibits a non-monotonous shear rate dependence, first decreasing but beyond a
critical shear rate increasing. Our experiments suggest the emergence of
collective dipolar relaxation under the influence of the competing effects of
hydrodynamic and dielectric torques.

<p>Yamdb (Yet another materials data base) addresses the need to provide
thermophysical properties of liquid metals and molten salts in an easily
accessible manner. Mathematical relations describing material properties -
usually determined by experiment - are taken from the literature. Equations and
their coefficients are stored separately. The former can be implemented in any
programming language (Python and Go in this case) and the latter are kept in
YAML files together with additional information (source, temperature range,

<h3>Anomalous thermal oxidation of gadolinium thin films deposited on  silicon by high pressure sputtering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10925" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10925</a>
<br>
<i>María Ángela Pampillón, Pedro Carlos Feijoo, Enrique San Andrés, María Luisa Lucía, María Toledano-Luque</i>
<p>Thin gadolinium metallic layers were deposited by high-pressure sputtering in
pure Ar atmosphere. Subsequently, in situ thermal oxidation was performed at
temperatures ranging from 150 to 750 $^\circ$C. At an oxidation temperature of
500 $^\circ$C the films show a transition from monoclinic structure to a
mixture of monoclinic and cubic. Regrowth of interfacial SiO$_x$ is observed as
temperature is increased, up to 1.6 nm for 750 $^\circ$C. This temperature
yields the lowest interface trap density, 4e10 eV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the
effective permittivity of the resulting dielectric is only 7.4. The reason of
this low value is found on the oxidation mechanism, which yields a surface with
located bumps. These bumps increase the average thickness, thus reducing the
capacitance and therefore the calculated permittivity.

<h3>A minimalist approach to 3D photoemission orbital tomography: algorithms  and data requirements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10929</a>
<br>
<i>Thi Lan Dinh, G. S. Matthijs Jansen, D. Russell Luke, Wiebke Bennecke, Stefan Mathias</i>
<p>Photoemission orbital tomography provides direct access from laboratory
measurements to the real-space molecular orbitals of well-ordered organic
semiconductor layers. Specifically, the application of phase retrieval
algorithms to photon-energy- and angle-resolved photoemission data enables the
direct reconstruction of full 3D molecular orbitals without the need for
simulations using density functional theory or the like. A major limitation for
the direct approach has been the need for densely-sampled, well-calibrated 3D
photoemission patterns. Here, we present an iterative projection algorithm that
completely eliminates this challenge: for the benchmark case of the pentacene
frontier orbitals, we demonstrate the reconstruction of the full orbital based
on a dataset containing only four simulated photoemission momentum
measurements. We discuss the algorithm performance, sampling requirements with
respect to the photon energy, optimal measurement strategies, and the accuracy
of orbital images that can be achieved.

<h3>Enabling discovery of materials through enhanced generalisability of  deep learning models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10931</a>
<br>

<p>The road towards the discovery of new, useful materials is full of
imperfections. Machine learning, which is currently the power horse of material
discovery when it works in concert with density functional theory, has been
able to accelerate the discovery of new materials for various applications by
learning the properties of known, stable materials to infer the properties of
unknown, deformed materials. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is
particularly believed to bridge the gap between known materials and the
virtually infinite space of crystal structures with imperfections such as
defects, grain boundaries, composition disorders and others. State of the art
PIML models struggle to bridge this gap, however. In this work we show that a
critical correction of the physics underpinning a PIML, our direct integration
of external potential (DIEP) method, which mimics the integration of the
external potential term in typical density functional theory calculations,
improves the generalisability of the model to a range of imperfect structures,
including diamond defects. DIEP has the potential of enhancing the accuracy of
potential energy surface prediction, which can accelarate structure discovery.

<p>Science is and always has been based on data, but the terms "data-centric"
and the "4th paradigm of" materials research indicate a radical change in how
information is retrieved, handled and research is performed. It signifies a
transformative shift towards managing vast data collections, digital
repositories, and innovative data analytics methods. The integration of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset Machine Learning (ML), has become
pivotal in addressing all these challenges. This Roadmap on Data-Centric
Materials Science explores fundamental concepts and methodologies, illustrating
diverse applications in electronic-structure theory, soft matter theory,
microstructure research, and experimental techniques like photoemission, atom
probe tomography, and electron microscopy.
While the roadmap delves into specific areas within the broad
interdisciplinary field of materials science, the provided examples elucidate
key concepts applicable to a wider range of topics. The discussed instances
offer insights into addressing the multifaceted challenges encountered in
contemporary materials research.

<h3>Mechanical prions: Self-assembling microstructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10939</a>
<br>
<i>Mathieu Ouellet, Dani S. Bassett, Lee C. Bassett, Kieran A. Murphy, Shubhankar P. Patankar</i>
<p>Prions are misfolded proteins that transmit their structural arrangement to
neighboring proteins. In biological systems, prion dynamics can produce a
variety of complex functional outcomes. Yet, an understanding of prionic causes
has been hampered by the fact that few computational models exist that allow
for experimental design, hypothesis testing, and control. Here, we identify
essential prionic properties and present a biologically inspired model of
prions using simple mechanical structures capable of undergoing complex
conformational change. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by designing
a prototypical mechanical prion and validating its properties experimentally.
Our work provides a design framework for harnessing and manipulating prionic
properties in natural and artificial systems.

<h3>Designing metainterfaces with specified friction laws</h3>

<br>
<i>Antoine Aymard, Emilie Delplanque, Davy Dalmas, Julien Scheibert</i>
<p>Many devices, including touchscreens and robotic hands, involve frictional
contacts. Optimizing these devices requires fine control of the interface's
friction law. We lack systematic methods to create dry contact interfaces whose
frictional behavior satisfies preset specifications. We propose a generic
surface design strategy to prepare dry rough interfaces that have predefined
relationships between normal and friction forces. Such metainterfaces
circumvent the usual multiscale challenge of tribology by considering
simplified surface topographies as assemblies of spherical asperities.
Optimizing the individual asperities' heights enables specific friction laws to
be targeted. Through various centimeter-scaled elastomer-glass metainterfaces,
we illustrate three types of achievable friction laws, including linear laws
with a specified friction coefficient and unusual nonlinear laws. This design
strategy represents a scale- and material-independent, chemical-free pathway
toward energy-saving and adaptable smart interfaces.

<h3>The noise intensity of a Markov chain</h3>

<br>
<i>Lukas Ramlow, Benjamin Lindner</i>
<p>Stochastic transitions between discrete microscopic states play an important
role in many physical and biological systems. Often, these transitions lead to
fluctuations on a macroscopic scale. A classic example from neuroscience is the
stochastic opening and closing of ion channels and the resulting fluctuations
in membrane current. When the microscopic transitions are fast, the macroscopic
fluctuations are nearly uncorrelated and can be fully characterized by their
mean and noise intensity. We show how, for an arbitrary Markov chain, the noise
intensity can be determined from an algebraic equation, based on the transition
rate matrix. We demonstrate the validity of the theory using an analytically
tractable two-state Markovian dichotomous noise, an eight-state model for a
Calcium channel subunit (De Young-Keizer model), and Markov models of the
voltage-gated Sodium and Potassium channels as they appear in a stochastic
version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

<h3>Coherent states in microwave-induced resistance oscillations and zero  resistance states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11002" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11002</a>
<br>
<i>Jesus Iñarrea, Gloria Platero-</i>
<p>We investigate irradiated high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems
(2DES) under low or moderated magnetic fields. These systems present
microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillations (MIRO) which, as we
demonstrate, reveal the presence of coherent states of the quantum harmonic
oscillator. We also show that the principle of minimum uncertainty of coherent
states is at the heart of MIRO and zero resistance states (ZRS). Accordingly,
we are able to explain, based on coherent states, important experimental
evidence of these photo-oscillations. Such as their physical origin, their
periodicity with the inverse of the magnetic field and their peculiar
oscillations minima and maxima positions in regards of the magnetic field.
Thus, remarkably enough, we come to the conclusion that 2DES, under low
magnetic fields, become a system of quasiclassical states or coherent states
and MIRO would be the smoking gun of the existence of these peculiar states is
these systems.

<h3>Stability of quasiperiodic superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Nicole Sabina Ticea, Julian May-Mann, Jiewen Xiao, Erez Berg, Trithep Devakul</i>
<p>We study the effects of quasiperiodicity on the stability of conventional and
unconventional superconductors. Quasiperiodicity is modelled using the
three-dimensional Aubry-Andre model, a system in which electrons are coupled to
a translation-symmetry-breaking potential that is incommensurate with the
underlying lattice. Upon increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic
potential, the single-particle eigenstates undergo a transition from a
ballistic to a diffusive character. Here, we study the instability of the model
towards superconductivity. We find that in the ballistic regime, the system is
unstable towards both $s$-wave and $p$-wave superconductivity. In contrast,
only the conventional $s$-wave instability survives in the intermediate
diffusive regime. Our results suggest a version of Anderson's theorem for
quasiperiodic systems, relating the normal state dynamics to the stability of
conventional and unconventional superconductivity. These findings are relevant
vis-a-vis recent studies of superconductivity in quasiperiodic moire
structures.

<p>Variational quantum calculations have borrowed many tools and algorithms from
the machine learning community in the recent years. Leveraging great expressive
power and efficient gradient-based optimization, researchers have shown that
trial states inspired by deep learning problems can accurately model many-body
correlated phenomena in spin, fermionic and qubit systems. In this review, we
derive the central equations of different flavors variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
approaches, including ground state search, time evolution and overlap
optimization, and discuss data-driven tasks like quantum state tomography. An
emphasis is put on the geometry of the variational manifold as well as
bottlenecks in practical implementations. An overview of recent results of
first-principles ground-state and real-time calculations is provided.

<h3>Exploring the Phase Diagram of the quantum one-dimensional ANNNI model</h3>

<p>In this manuscript, we explore the intersection of QML and TN in the context
of the one-dimensional ANNNI model with a transverse field. The study aims to
concretely connect QML and TN by combining them in various stages of algorithm
construction, focusing on phase diagram reconstruction for the ANNNI model,
with supervised and unsupervised techniques. The model's significance lies in
its representation of quantum fluctuations and frustrated exchange
interactions, making it a paradigm for studying magnetic ordering, frustration,
and the presence of a floating phase. It concludes with discussions of the
results, including insights from increased system sizes and considerations for
future work, such as addressing limitations in QCNN and exploring more
realistic implementations of QC.

<h3>Electronic structure and magnetism in P4/nmm KCoO2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11030</a>
<br>
<i>Ozan Dernek, Santosh Kumar Radha, Jerome Jackson, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</i>
<p>KCoO2 has been found in 1975 to exist in a unique structure with P4/nmm
spacegroup with Co in a square pyramidal coordination with the Co atoms in the
plane linked by O in a square arrangement reminiscent of the cuprates but its
electronic structure has not been studied until now. Unlike Co atoms in LiCoO2
and NaCoO2 in octahedral coordination, which are non-magnetic band structure
insulators, the unusual coordination of d6 Co^{3+} in KCoO2 is here shown to
lead to a magnetic stabilization of an insulating structure with high magnetic
moments of 4{\mu}B per Co. The electronic band structure is calculated using
the quasiparticle self-consistent (QS)GW method and the basic formation of
magnetic moments is explained in terms of the orbital decomposition of the
bands. The optical dielectric function is calculated using the Bethe-Salpeter
equation including only transitions between equal spin bands. The magnetic
moments are shown to prefer an antiferromagnetic ordering along the [110]
direction. Exchange interactions are calculated from the transverse spin
susceptibility and a rigid spin approximation. The N\'eel temperature is
estimated using the mean-field and Tyablikov methods and found to be between
approximately 100 and 250 K. The band structure in the AFM ordering can be
related to the FM ordering by band folding effects. The optical spectra are
similar in both structures and show evidence of excitonic features below the
quasiparticle gap of about 4 eV.

<h3>Random telegraph processes with non-local memory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11038" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11038</a>
<br>
<i>S.S. Apostolov, O.V. Usatenko, V.A. Yampol'skii, S.S. Melnyk, P. Grigolini, A.Krokhin</i>
<p>We study two-state (dichotomous, telegraph) random ergodic continuous-time
processes with dynamics depending on their past. We take into account the
history of process in an explicit form by introducing an integral non-local
memory term into the conditional probability function. We start from an
expression for the conditional transition probability function describing
additive multi-step binary random chain and show that the telegraph processes
can be considered as continuous-time interpolations of discrete-time
dichotomous random sequences. An equation involving the memory function and the
two-point correlation function of the telegraph process is analytically
obtained. This integral equation defines the correlation properties of the
processes with given memory functions. It also serves as a tool for solving the
inverse problem, namely for generation of a telegraph process with a prescribed
pair correlation function. We obtain analytically the correlation functions of
the telegraph processes with two exactly solvable examples of memory functions
and support these results by numerical simulations of the corresponding
telegraph processes.

<h3>Standardization of chemically selective atomic force microscopy for  metal-oxide surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11045" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11045</a>
<br>
<i>Philipp Wiesener, Stefan Förster, Milena Merkel, Bertram Schulze Lammers, Harald Fuchs, Saeed Amirjalayer, Harry Mönig</i>
<p>The complex atomic structures and defects of metal-oxide surfaces are vital
for a variety of applications in material science and chemistry. While scanning
probe microscopy allows accessing atomic-scale structures in real space,
elemental discrimination and defect characterization usually rely on indirect
assumptions and extensive theoretical modelling. By investigating a variety of
different sample systems with increasing structural complexity and inherent
defects, we demonstrate that noncontact atomic force microscopy with an
O-terminated copper tip allows imaging metal-oxide surfaces with a clear
elemental contrast. This universal approach provides not only immediate access
to the metal- and oxygen sub-lattices, but also to the chemical and structural
configuration of atomic-scale defect structures. The observed contrast can be
explained by purely electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged
tip apex and the strongly varying electrostatic potential between metal- and
oxygen surface sites. These results offer a standardized methodology for the
direct structural characterization of even most-complex metal-oxide surfaces,
which is highly relevant for a fundamental understanding of atomic-scale
processes on these material systems.

<h3>Aging properties of the voter model with long-range interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11079" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11079</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Corberi, Luca Smaldone</i>
<p>We investigate the aging properties of the one-dimensional voter model with
long-range interactions in its ordering kinetics. In this system, an agent
$S_i=\pm 1$ positioned at a lattice vertex $i$, copies the state of another one
located at a distance $r$, selected randomly with a probability $P(r) \propto
r^{-\alpha}$. Employing both analytical and numerical methods, we compute the
two-time correlation function $G(r;t,s)$ ($t\ge s$) between the state of a
variable $S_i$ at time $s$ and that of another one, at distance $r$, at time
$t$. At time $t$, the memory of an agent of its former state at time $s$,
expressed by the {\it autocorrelation function} $A(t,s)=G(r=0;t,s)$, decays
algebraically for $\alpha >1$ as $[L(t)/L(s)]^{-\lambda}$, where $L$ is a
time-increasing coherence length and $\lambda $ is the Fisher-Huse exponent. We
find $\lambda =1$ for $\alpha >2$, and $\lambda =1/(\alpha-1)$ for $1<\alpha
\le 2$. For $\alpha \le 1$, instead, there is an exponential decay, as in
mean-field. Then, at variance with what is known for the related Ising model,
here we find that $\lambda $ increases upon decreasing $\alpha$. The
space-dependent correlation $G(r;t,s)$ obeys a scaling symmetry
$G(r;t,s)=g[r/L(s);L(t)/L(s)]$ for $\alpha >2$. Similarly, for $1<\alpha \le 2$
one has $G(r;t,s)=g[r/{\cal L}(t);{\cal L}(t)/{\cal L}(s)] $, where now the
length ${\cal L}$ regulating two-time correlations differs from the coherence
length as ${\cal L}\propto L^\delta$, with $\delta=1+2(2-\alpha)$.

<i>Md Rafique Un Nabi, Yue Li, Suzanne G E te Velthuis, Santosh Karki Chhetri, Dinesh Upreti, Rabindra Basnet, Gokul Acharya, Charudatta Phatak, Jin Hu</i>
<p>Spintronics, an evolving interdisciplinary field at the intersection of
magnetism and electronics, explores innovative applications of electron charge
and spin properties for advanced electronic devices. The topological Hall
effect, a key component in spintronics, has gained significance due to emerging
theories surrounding noncoplanar chiral spin textures. This study focuses on
Mn2-xZnxSb, a material crystalizing in centrosymmetric space group with rich
magnetic phases tunable by Zn contents. Through comprehensive magnetic and
transport characterizations, we found that the high-Zn (x>0.6) samples display
THE which is enhanced with decreasing temperature, while THE in the low-Zn
(x<0.6) samples show an opposite trend. The coexistence of those distinct
temperature dependences for THE suggests very different magnetic
interactions/structure for different compositions and underscores the strong
coupling between magnetism and transport in Mn2-xZnxSb. Our findings contribute
to understanding topological magnetism in centrosymmetric tetragonal lattices,
establishing Mn2-xZnxSb as a unique platform for exploring tunable transport
effects and opening avenues for further exploration in the realm of
spintronics.

<i>Hualin Zhan, Viqar Ahmad, Azul Mayon, Grace Tabi, Anh Dinh Bui, Zhuofeng Li, Daniel Walters, Hieu Nguyen, Klaus Weber, Thomas White, Kylie Catchpole</i>
<p>The ability to extract material parameters from quantitative experimental
analysis is essential for rational design and theory advancement. However, the
difficulty of this analysis increases significantly with the complexity of the
theoretical model and the number of material parameters. Here we use Bayesian
optimization to develop an analysis platform that can extract up to 8
fundamental material parameters of an organometallic perovskite semiconductor
from a transient photoluminescence experiment, based on a complex full physics
model that includes drift-diffusion of carriers and dynamic defect occupation.
An example study of thermal degradation reveals that changes in doping
concentration and carrier mobility dominate, while the defect energy level
remains nearly unchanged. This platform can be conveniently applied to other
experiments or to combinations of experiments, accelerating materials discovery
and optimization of semiconductor materials for photovoltaics and other
applications.

to a specific material system, elasto-electro-active piezoelectric ceramic
embedded plastics, which has great potential in sensing, 5G communication, and
energy harvesting. Due to the multiphysics interactions of the studied material
system, we have developed an accurate and efficient FFT-based numerical method
to find the multifunctional properties of diverse cellular microstructures
generated by our HetMiGen code. To mine this big dataset, we used our
customized physics-aware generative neural network in the format of a VAE with
convolutional neural layers augmented by a vision transformer to learn
long-distance features which may affect the properties of the 3D voxelized
microstructures. In training, the decoder learns how to map the property
distribution to the appropriate high-dimensional distribution of 3D
microstructures. Therefore, it can be considered an online material designer
within the explored design space during its inference phase.

<p>Phase-separated magnetic fluids provide a very strong magnetic response
($\mu>25$) in a liquid state material. Even small fields can cause a notable
material response, but this depends on its properties, which are often
difficult to control. Here, we investigate how temperature affects the
properties of the system, where phase separation is induced by an increase in
ionic strength. Following the deformations of individual microscopic droplets,
we can extract surface tension, magnetic permeability, and viscosity. We find
that the temperature increase does not affect the surface tension, while the
magnetic permeability and viscosity increase. Applying this knowledge to induce
a shape instability for a drop only using temperature shows the potential of
applicability of our findings.

<p>The breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in the normal state of kagome
superconductors $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ stands out as a significant feature. Yet the
extent to which this effect can be tuned remains uncertain, a crucial aspect to
grasp in light of the varying details of TRS breaking observed through
different techniques. Here, we employ the unique low-energy muon spin rotation
technique combined with local field numerical analysis to study the TRS
breaking response as a function of depth from the surface in single crystals of
RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ with charge order and Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$
without charge order. In the bulk (i.e., > 33 nm from the surface) of
RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, we have detected a notable increase in the internal magnetic
field width experienced by the muon ensemble. This increase occurs only within
the charge ordered state. Intriguingly, the muon spin relaxation rate is
significantly enhanced near the surface (i.e., < 33 nm from the surface) of
RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and this effect commences at temperatures significantly
higher than the onset of charge order. Conversely, in
Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, we do not observe a similar
enhancement in the internal field width, neither in the bulk nor near the
surface. These observations indicate a strong connection between charge order
and TRS breaking on one hand, and on the other hand, suggest that TRS breaking
can occur prior to long-range charge order. This research offers compelling
evidence for depth-dependent magnetism in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ superconductors in
the presence of charge order. Such findings are likely to elucidate the
intricate microscopic mechanisms that underpin the TRS breaking phenomena in
these materials.

<p>Recently, LiGa$_5$O$_8$ was identified as a cubic spinel type
ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor with a gap of about 5.36 eV and reported to
be unintentionally p-type. Here we present first-principles calculations of the
native defects and various of their complexes to try to explain the occurrence
of p-type doping. Although we find Li-vacancies to be somewhat shallower
acceptors than in LiGaO$_2$, and becoming slightly shallower in complexes with
donors such as V$_{\rm O}$ and Ga$_{\rm Li}$ antisites, these $V_{\rm Li}$
based defects are not sufficiently shallow to explain p-type doping. The
dominant defects are donors and in equilibrium the Fermi level would be
determined by compensation between donors and acceptors, and pinned deep in the
gap.

<i>Stephen Sanderson, Shern R. Tee, Debra J. Searles</i>
<p>Temperature measurements in particle simulations must account for the
reduction in degrees of freedom (DoF) due to constraints. However, when local
temperature is measured, e.g. from a set of particles in a subvolume or from
velocities projected onto one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to
unphysically violate equipartition if the local DoF are not correctly
calculated. Here we provide a self-consistent method for calculating the DoF
for an arbitrary local kinetic temperature measurement.

<p>Superconductivity is a remarkable phenomenon in condensed matter physics,
which comprises a fascinating array of properties expected to revolutionize
energy-related technologies and pertinent fundamental research. However, the
field faces the challenge of achieving superconductivity at room temperature.
In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have emerged as a
promising tool for predicting such properties as transition temperature (Tc) to
enable the rapid screening of large databases to discover new superconducting
materials. This study employs the SuperCon dataset as the largest
superconducting materials dataset. Then, we perform various data pre-processing
steps to derive the clean DataG dataset, containing 13022 compounds. In another
stage of the study, we apply the novel CatBoost algorithm to predict the
transition temperatures of novel superconducting materials. In addition, we
developed a package called Jabir, which generates 322 atomic descriptors. We
also designed an innovative hybrid method called Soraya package to select the
most critical features from the feature space. These yield R2 and RMSE values
(0.952 and 6.45 K, respectively) superior to those previously reported in the
literature. Finally, as a novel contribution to the field, a web application
was designed for predicting and determining the Tc values of superconducting
materials.

<p>Confining glassy polymer into films can substantially modify their local and
film-averaged properties. We present a lattice model of film geometry with
void-mediated facilitation behaviors but free from any elasticity effect. We
analyze the spatially varying viscosity to delineate the transport property of
glassy films. The film mobility measurements reported by [Yang et. al.,
Science, 2010, 328, 1676] are successfully reproduced. The flow exhibits a
crossover from simple viscous flow to a surface-dominated regime as temperature
decreases. The propagation of a highly mobile front induced by the free surface
is visualized in real space. Our approach provides a microscopic treatment of
the observed glassy phenomena.

<h3>Spin dynamics and dark particle in a weak-coupled quantum Ising ladder  with $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ spectrum</h3>

<p>Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder
composed of two weakly coupled, critical transverse field Ising chains. This
integrable system is remarkable for including eight types of massive
relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and spectrum characterized
by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article we delve into the
zero-temperature spin dynamics of this integrable quantum Ising ladder. By
computing the dynamical structure factors from analytical form factor approach,
we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton
and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spin dynamical
spectrum. We show that the selection rule to the form factor, which is inherent
in the intrinsic charge-parity $\mathcal{C}$ of the Ising$_h^2$ particles as
well as the local spin operators, causes a significant result that
$\mathcal{C}$-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly
excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations.
Furthermore, the lightest dark particle is proposed to be generated and
controlled through resonant absorption-resonant emission processes. The long
lifetime of dark particle suggests its potential as a stable qubit for
advancing quantum information technology.

<h3>Superconductivity enhancement and particle-hole asymmetry: interplay  with electron attraction in doped Hubbard model</h3>

<i>Zhi Xu, Hong-Chen Jiang, Yi-Fan Jiang</i>
<p>The role of near-neighbor electron attraction $V$ in strongly correlated
systems has been at the forefront of recent research of unconventional
superconductivity. However, its implications in the doped Hubbard model on
expansive systems remain predominantly unexplored. In this study, we employ the
density-matrix renormalization group to examine its effect in the lightly doped
$t$-$t'$-Hubbard model on six-leg square cylinders, where $t$ and $t'$ are the
first and second neighbor electron hopping amplitudes. For positive $t'$ in the
electron-doped case, our results show that the attractive $V$ can significantly
enhance the superconducting correlations and drive the system into a pronounced
superconducting phase when the attraction exceeds a modest value $V_c \approx
0.7t$. In contrast, in the hole-doped regime with negative $t' $, while
heightened superconducting correlations have also been observed in the charge
stripe phase, the systems remain insulating with pronounced charge density wave
order. Our results demonstrate the importance of the electron attraction in
boosting superconductivity in broader doped Hubbard systems and highlight the
asymmetry between the electron and hole-doped regimes.

<h3>Fourier Electron Optics with Massless Dirac Fermions Scattered by  Quantum Dot Lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh</i>
<p>The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of
electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials
subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of
electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We
significantly extend this analogy by introducing Fourier electron optics (FEO)
with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer
graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a
two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger
formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a cavity, as
well as the moir\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic
analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the
resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction
pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the
resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of
the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers
and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that
the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets
filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating
wider applicability of FEO of MDF.

<h3>On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one  dimension</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Patrón, A. D. Chepelianskii, A. Prados, E. Trizac</i>
<p>We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding
to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with
even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed
balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the
fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between
diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new
regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation
dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt
an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term
this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical
techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and
CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a
phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple
point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection,
diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is
checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also
briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate
to equilibrium.

<h3>Many-body localization properties of fully frustrated Heisenberg  spin-1/2 ladder model with next-nearest-neighbor interaction</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiameng Hong, Taotao Hu</i>
<p>Many-body localization (MBL) is an intriguing physical phenomenon that arises
from the interplay of interaction and disorder, allowing quantum systems to
prevent thermalization. In this study, we investigate the MBL properties of the
fully frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 ladder model with next-nearest-neighbor
hopping interaction along the leg direction and compare it with the Heisenberg
spin-1/2 single-chain model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping interaction. We
explore the MBL transition using random matrix theory and study the
characteristics of entanglement entropy and its variance. Our results show that
for the single-chain model, the critical point $w _{1} \sim$ 7.5 $\pm$ 0.5,
whereas for the frustrated ladder model, $w _{2} \sim$ 10.5 $\pm$ 0.5.
Moreover, we observe the existence of a many-body mobility edge in the
frustrated ladder model. We also investigate the dynamical properties of the
frustrated ladder model and identify the logarithmic growth of entanglement
entropy, high fidelity of initial information, and magnetic localization
phenomenon in the localized phase. Finally, we explore the finite-size scaling
of the two models. Our findings suggest that interpreting MBL transition as a
continuous second-order phase transition yields a better scaling solution than
the Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition for our two models, and this difference
is more pronounced in the frustrated ladder model compared with the
single-chain model.

<p>Phonon dispersion is widely used to elucidate the vibrational properties of
materials. As an emerging technique, momentum-resolved vibrational spectroscopy
in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) offers an unparalleled
approach to explore q-dependent phonon behavior at local structures. In this
study, we systematically investigate the phonon dispersion of monolayer
graphene across several Brillouin zones (BZs) using momentum-resolved
vibrational spectroscopy and find that the optical phonon signals vanish at the
{\Gamma} points with indices (hk0) satisfying h+2k=3n (n denoted integers).
Theoretical analysis reveals that this is due to the complete destructive
interference of the scattered waves from different basis atoms. Importantly, we
show that the systematic absences should be a general characteristic of
materials composed of symmetrically equivalent pairs of the same elements,
which have not been appreciated in vibrational spectroscopy before, offering
new insights into the experimental assessment of local vibrational properties
of materials.

<i>Yutaka Okabe, Komajiro Niizeki, Yoshiaki Araki</i>
<p>Smith et al discovered an aperiodic monotile of 13-sided shape in 2023. It is
called the `Smith hat' and consists of 8 kites. We deal with the statistical
physics of the lattice of the kites, which we call the `Smith-kite lattice'. We
studied the Ising model on the aperiodic Smith-kite lattice and the dual
Smith-kite lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. We combined the Swendsen-Wang
multi-cluster algorithm and the replica exchange method. We simulated systems
up to the total spin number $939201$. Using the finite-size scaling analysis,
we estimated the critical temperature on the Smith-kite lattice as $T_c/J=2.405
\pm 0.0005$ and that of the dual Smith-kite lattice as $T^{*}_{c}/J=2.143 \pm
0.0005$. Moreover, we confirmed the duality relation between the critical
temperatures on the dual pair of aperiodic lattices, $\sinh(2J/T_c)
\sinh(2J/T^{*}_{c}) = 1.000 \pm 0.001$. We also checked the duality relation
for the nearest-neighbor correlation at the critical temperature, essentially
the energy, $\epsilon(T_c)/\coth(2J/T_c) + \epsilon(T^{*}_c)/\coth(2J/T^{*}_c)
= 1.000 \pm 0.001$.

<i>Vansh Ramani, Tarak Karmakar</i>
<p>Prediction of solubility has been a complex and challenging physiochemical
problem that has tremendous implications in the chemical and pharmaceutical
industry. Recent advancements in machine learning methods have provided great
scope for predicting the reliable solubility of a large number of molecular
systems. However, most of these methods rely on using physical properties
obtained from experiments and or expensive quantum chemical calculations. Here,
we developed a method that utilizes a graphical representation of
solute-solvent interactions using `MolMerger', which captures the strongest
polar interactions between molecules using Gasteiger charges and creates a
graph incorporating the true nature of the system. Using these graphs as input,
a neural network learns the correlation between the structural properties of a
molecule in the form of node embedding and its physiochemical properties as
output. This approach has been used to calculate molecular solubility by
predicting the Log solubility values of various organic molecules and
pharmaceuticals in diverse sets of solvents.

<i>Subhajit Paul, Abhishek Dhar, Debasish Chaudhuri</i>
<p>We explore the dynamics of a tracer in an active particle harmonic chain,
investigating the influence of interactions. Our analysis involves calculating
mean-squared displacements (MSD) and space-time correlations through Green's
function techniques and numerical simulations. Depending on chain
characteristics, i.e., different time scales determined by interaction
stiffness and persistence of activity, tagged-particle MSD exhibit ballistic,
diffusive, and single-file diffusion (SFD) scaling over time, with crossovers
explained by our analytic expressions. Our results reveal transitions in bulk
particle displacement distributions from an early-time bimodal to late-time
Gaussian, passing through regimes of unimodal distributions with finite support
and negative excess kurtosis and longer-tailed distributions with positive
excess kurtosis. The distributions exhibit data collapse, aligning with
ballistic, diffusive, and SFD scaling in the appropriate time regimes. However,
at much longer times, the distributions become Gaussian. Finally, we derive
expressions for steady-state static and dynamic two-point displacement
correlations, consistent with simulations and converging to equilibrium results
for small persistence. Additionally, the two-time stretch correlation extends
to longer separation at later times, while the autocorrelation for the bulk
particle shows diffusive scaling beyond the persistence time.

<i>Huiju Lee, Yi Xia</i>
<p>Phonons, as quantized vibrational modes in crystalline materials, play a
crucial role in determining a wide range of physical properties, such as
thermal and electrical conductivity, making their study a cornerstone in
materials science. In this study, we present a simple yet effective strategy
for deep learning harmonic phonons in crystalline solids by leveraging existing
phonon databases and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The key of
our method lies in transforming existing phonon datasets, primarily represented
in interatomic force constants, into a force-displacement representation
suitable for training machine learning universal interatomic potentials. By
applying our approach to one of the largest phonon databases publicly
available, we demonstrate that the resultant machine learning universal
harmonic interatomic potential not only accurately predicts full harmonic
phonon spectra but also calculates key thermodynamic properties with remarkable
precision. Furthermore, the restriction to a harmonic potential energy surface
in our model provides a way of assessing uncertainty in machine learning
predictions of vibrational properties, essential for guiding further
improvements and applications in materials science.

<p>Confinement of monolayers into quasi-one-dimensional atomically-thin
nanoribbons could lead to novel quantum phenomena beyond those achieved in
their bulk and monolayer counterparts. However, current experimental
availability of nanoribbon species beyond graphene has been limited to
bottom-up synthesis or top-down patterning. In this study, we introduce a
versatile and direct lithography-free approach to exfoliate a variety of bulk
van der Waals (vdW) crystals into nanoribbons. Akin to the Scotch tape
exfoliation in producing monolayers, this technique provides convenient access
to a wide range of nanoribbons derived from their corresponding bulk crystals,
including MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, MoTe2, WTe2, ReS2, and hBN. The nanoribbons
are single-crystalline, parallel-aligned, flat, and have high aspect ratio. We
demonstrated the electrical, magnetic, and optical properties from the
confinement, strain, and edge configurations of these nanoribbons. This
versatile preparation technique will pave the way for future experimental
investigation and broad applications in optoelectronic, sensing, electronic and

<h3>Local and Global Expansivity in Water</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Philipp Gabriel, Robin Horstmann, Martin Tress</i>
<p>The supra-molecular structure of a liquid is strongly connected to its
dynamics which in turn controls macroscopic properties such as viscosity.
Consequently, detailed knowledge about how this structure changes with
temperature is essential to understand the thermal evolution of the dynamics
ranging from the liquid to the glass. Here we combine infrared spectroscopy
(IR) measurements of the hydrogen (H) bond stretching vibration of water with
molecular dynamics simulations and employ a quantitative analysis to extract
the inter-molecular H-bond length in a wide temperature range of the liquid.
The extracted expansivity of this H-bond differs strongly from that of the
average nearest neighbor distance of oxygen atoms obtained through a common
conversion of mass density. However, both properties can be connected through a
simple model based on a random loose packing of spheres with a variable
coordination number which demonstrates the relevance of supra-molecular
arrangement. Further, the exclusion of the expansivity of the inter-molecular
H-bonds reveals that the most compact molecular arrangement is formed in the
range $\sim316-331\,\text{K}$ (i.e. above the density maximum) close to the
temperature of several pressure-related anomalies which indicates a
characteristic point in the supra-molecular arrangement. These results confirm
our earlier approach to deduce inter-molecular H-bond lengths via IR in
polyalcohols [Gabriel et al. 2021] quantitatively and open a new alley to
investigate the role of inter-molecular expansion as a precursor of molecular
fluctuations on a bond-specific level.

<p>The composite fermion theory opened a new chapter in understanding many-body
correlations through the formation of emergent particles. The formation of
two-flux and four-flux composite fermions is well established. While there are
limited data linked to the formation of six-flux composite fermions,
topological protection associated with them is conspicuously lacking. Here we
report evidence for the formation of a quantized and gapped fractional quantum
Hall state at the filling factor $\nu=9/11$, which we associate with the
formation of six-flux composite fermions. Our result provides evidence for the
most intricate composite fermion with six fluxes and expands the already
diverse family of highly correlated topological phases with a new member that
cannot be characterized by correlations present in other known members. Our
observations pave the way towards the study of higher order correlations in the
fractional quantum Hall regime.

<i>Woo Seok Lee, Taegeun Song, Kyoung-Min Kim</i>
<p>The application of twist engineering in van der Waals magnets has opened new
frontiers in the field of two-dimensional magnetism, yielding distinctive
magnetic domain structures. Despite the introduction of numerous theoretical
methods, limitations persist in terms of accuracy or efficiency due to the
complex nature of the magnetic Hamiltonians pertinent to these systems. In this
study, we introduce a deep-learning approach to tackle these challenges.
Utilizing customized, fully connected networks, we develop two
deep-neural-network kernels that facilitate efficient and reliable analysis of
twisted van der Waals magnets. Our regression model is adept at estimating the
magnetic Hamiltonian parameters of twisted bilayer CrI3 from its magnetic
domain images generated through atomistic spin simulations. The generative
model excels in producing precise magnetic domain images from the provided
magnetic parameters. The trained networks for these models undergo thorough
validation, including statistical error analysis and assessment of robustness
against noisy injections. These advancements not only extend the applicability
of deep-learning methods to twisted van der Waals magnets but also streamline
future investigations into these captivating yet poorly understood systems.

<p>Artificial molecular rotors and motors hold great promise for functional
nanomachines, but constructing diatomic rotors, crucial for these machines, is
challenging due to surface constraints and limited chemical design. Here we
report the construction of diatomic Cr-Cs and Fe-Cs rotors where a Cr or Fe
atom revolves around a Cs atom at the Sb surface of the newly-discovered kagome
superconductor CsV3Sb5. The rotation rate is controlled by bias voltage between
the rotor and scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip. The spatial distribution
of rates exhibits C2 symmetry, might linked to the symmetry-breaking charge
orders of CsV3Sb5. We have expanded rotor construction to include different
transition metals (Cr, Fe, V) and alkali metals (Cs, K). Remarkably, designed
configurations of rotors are achieved through STM manipulation. Rotor orbits
and quantum states are precisely controlled by tunning inter-rotor distance.
Our findings establish a novel platform for the atomically precise fabrication
of atomic motors on symmetry-breaking quantum materials, paving the way for
advanced nanoscale devices.

<i>Xiang Huang, C. Y. Zhao, Hong Wang, Shenghong Ju</i>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) promotes the polymer design paradigm from a
traditional trial-and-error approach to a data-driven style. Achieving high
thermal conductivity (TC) for intrinsic polymers is urgent because of their
importance in the thermal management of many industrial applications such as
microelectronic devices and integrated circuits. In this work, we have proposed
a robust AI-assisted workflow for the inverse design of high TC polymers. By
using 1144 polymers with known computational TCs, we construct a surrogate deep
neural network model for TC prediction and extract a polymer-unit library with
32 sequences. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms of
unified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (U-NSGA-III) and q-noisy
expected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI) are employed for sequence-ordered
polymer design with both high TC and synthetic possibility. For triblock
polymer design, the result indicates that qNHEVI is capable of exploring a
diversity of optimal polymers at the Pareto front, but the uncertainty in
Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling makes the trials costly. The performance of
U-NSGA-III is affected by the initial random structures and usually falls into
a locally optimal solution, but it takes fewer attempts with lower costs. 20
parallel U-NSGA-III runs are conducted to design the pentablock polymers with
high TC, and half of the candidates among 1921 generated polymers achieve the
targets (TC > 0.4 W/(mK) and SA < 3.0). Ultimately, we check the TC of 50
promising polymers through molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the
intrinsic connections between microstructures and TCs. Our developed
AI-assisted inverse design approach for polymers is flexible and universal, and
can be extended to the design of polymers with other target properties.

<p>We report measurements of the current-phase relation of two
voltage-controlled semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions
(JJs) in series. The two hybrid junctions behave similar to a single-mode JJ
with effective transparency determined by the ratio of Josephson coupling
strengths of the two junctions. Gate-voltage control of Josephson coupling
(measured from switching currents) allows tuning of the harmonic content from
sinusoidal, for asymmetric tuning, to highly nonsinusoidal, for symmetric
tuning. The experimentally observed tunable harmonic content agrees with a
model based on two conventional (sinusoidal) JJs in series.

<h3>Finite-frequency normal and superfluid drag effects in two-component  atomic Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>

<br>
<i>Azat F. Aminov, Alexey A. Sokolik, Yurii E. Lozovik</i>
<p>Two-component systems consisting of mutually interacting particles can
demonstrate both intracomponent transport effects and intercomponent
entrainment (or drag) effects. In the presence of superfluidity, the
intracomponent transport is characterized by dissipative conductivity and
superfluid weight in the framework of two-fluid model, and intercomponent
entrainment gives rise to normal and nondissipative drag effects. We present
unified treatment of all these effects for spatially homogeneous two-component
atomic Bose-Einstein condensates based on the Bogoliubov theory, focusing
specifically on the drag effects. Calculating finite-frequency intra- and
intercomponent conductivities with taking into account quasiparticle damping,
we derive and numerically check analytical Drude-like approximations applicable
at low frequencies, and Lorentz-like approximations applicable at higher
frequencies in vicinity of the resonant energy of spin-to-density Bogoliubov
quasiparticle conversion. As possible physical realizations of two-component
atomic systems, we consider three-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures and closely
spaced two-layered systems of magnetic dipolar atoms.

<h3>Impact of the La2NiO4+δ oxygen content on the synaptic properties  of the TiN/La2NiO4+δ/Pt memristive devices</h3>

<br>
<i>Aleksandra Koroleva, Thoai-Khanh Khuu, César Magén, Hervé Roussel, Carmen Jiménez, Céline Ternon, Elena-Ioana Vatajelu, Mónica Burriel</i>
<p>The rapid development of brain-inspired computing requires new artificial
components and architectures for its hardware implementation. In this regard,
memristive devices emerged as potential candidates for artificial synapses
because of their ability to emulate the plasticity of the biological synapses.
In this work, the synaptic behavior of the TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt memristive
devices based on thermally annealed La2NiO4+{\delta} films is thoroughly
investigated. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy, we show that annealing
using reducing (Ar) or oxidizing (O2) atmospheres affects the interstitial
oxygen content ({\delta}) in the La2NiO4+{\delta} films. Electrical
characterization shows that both devices exhibit long-term
potentiation/depression and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which makes them
suitable for neuromorphic applications. At the same time, the Ar annealed
TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt device demonstrates non-volatile properties with low
energy consumption during the learning process. On the other hand, in the O2
annealed TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt device the resistive switching behavior is
more volatile and requires more energy for synaptic learning. Finally, the
simulation tools show that spiking neural network architectures with
unsupervised learning rules based on the experimental data achieve high
inference accuracy in the digit recognition task, which proves the potential of
TiN/La2NiO4+{\delta}/Pt devices for artificial synapse applications.

<p>Ultrafast stimuli can stabilize metastable states of matter inaccessible by
equilibrium means. Establishing the spatiotemporal link between ultrafast
excitation and metastability is crucial to understanding these phenomena. Here,
we use single-shot optical-pump, X-ray-probe measurements to provide snapshots
of the emergence of a persistent polar vortex supercrystal in a heterostructure
that hosts a fine balance between built-in electrostatic and elastic
frustrations by design. By perturbing this balance with photoinduced charges, a
starting heterogenous mixture of polar phases disorders within a few
picoseconds, resulting in a soup state composed of disordered ferroelectric and
suppressed vortex orders. On the pico-to-nanosecond timescales, transient
labyrinthine fluctuations form in this soup along with a recovering vortex
order. On longer timescales, these fluctuations are progressively quenched by
dynamical strain modulations, which drive the collective emergence of a single
supercrystal phase. Our results, corroborated by dynamical phase-field
modeling, reveal how ultrafast excitation of designer systems generates
pathways for persistent metastability.

<h3>Electric field tunable superconductivity with competing orders in near  magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11649" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11649</a>
<br>
<i>Ranit Dutta, Ayan Ghosh, Shinjan Mandal, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, H.R. Krishnamurthy, Sumilan Banerjee, Manish Jain, Anindya Das</i>
<p>Superconductivity (SC) in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) has been explored
by varying carrier concentrations, twist angles, and screening strength, with
the aim of uncovering its origin and possible connections to strong electronic
correlations in narrow bands and various resulting broken symmetries. However,
the link between the tBLG band structure and the onset of SC and other orders
largely remains unclear. In this study, we address this crucial gap by
examining in-situ band structure tuning of a near magic-angle ($\theta
\approx0.95^0$) tBLG device with displacement field ($D$) and reveal remarkable
competition between SC and other broken symmetries. At zero $D$, the device
exhibits superconducting signatures without the resistance peak at
half-filling, a characteristic signature with a strong electronic correlation.
As $D$ increases, the SC is suppressed, accompanied by the appearance of a
resistance peak at half-filling. Hall density measurements reveal that at zero
$D$, SC arises around the van Hove singularity (vHs) from an isospin or
spin-valley unpolarized band. At higher $D$, the suppression of SC coincides
with broken isospin symmetry near half-filling with lifted degeneracy ($g_d
\sim 2$). Additionally, when SC is suppressed at higher $D$, density waves
around the superconducting dome are seen. These findings, with our theoretical
calculations, highlight the competition between SC and other orders, and the
stabilization of the latter by the electric field enhanced nesting in the band
structure of tBLG.

<h3>Exciton-photocarrier interference in mixed lead-halide-perovskite  nanocrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11673</a>
<br>
<i>Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Quinten A. Akkerman, Liberato Manna, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada, Carlos Silva-Acuña</i>
<p>The use of semiconductor nanocrystals in scalable quantum technologies
requires characterization of the exciton coherence dynamics in an
\emph{ensemble} of electronically isolated crystals in which system-bath
interactions are nevertheless strong. In this communication, we identify
signatures of Fano-like interference between excitons and photocarriers in the
coherent two-dimensional photoluminescence excitation spectral lineshapes of
mixed lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals in dilute solution. Specifically, by
tuning the femtosecond-pulse spectrum, we show such interference in an
intermediate coupling regime, which is evident in the coherent lineshape when
simultaneously exciting the exciton and the free-carrier band at higher energy.
We conclude that this interference is an intrinsic effect that will be
consequential in the quantum dynamics of the system and will thus dictate
decoherence dynamics, with consequences in their application in quantum
technologies.

<h3>Influence of mechanical compliance of the substrate on the morphology of  nanoporous gold thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11694</a>
<br>
<i>Sadi Shahriar, Kavya Somayajula, Conner Winkeljohn, Jeremy Mason, Erkin Seker</i>
<p>Nanoporous gold (np-Au) has found use in applications ranging from catalysis
to biosensing where pore morphology plays a critical role in performance. While
morphology evolution of bulk np-Au has been widely studied, knowledge about its
thin film form is limited. This work hypothesizes that mechanical compliance of
the thin film substrate can play a critical role in the morphology evolution.
Via experimental and finite-element-analysis approaches, we investigate the
morphological variation in np-Au thin films deposited on compliant silicone
(PDMS) substrates of a range of thicknesses anchored on rigid glass supports
and compare those to the morphology of np-Au deposited on glass. More
macroscopic (10s to 100s of microns) cracks and discrete islands form in the
np-Au films on PDMS compared to glass. Conversely, uniformly-distributed
microscopic (100s of nanometers) cracks form in greater numbers in the np-Au
films on glass than on PDMS, with the cracks located within the discrete
islands. The np-Au films on glass also show larger ligament and pore sizes
possibly due to higher residual stresses compared to the np-Au/PDMS films. The
effective elastic modulus of the substrate layers decreases with increasing
PDMS thickness, resulting in secondary np-Au morphology effects including a
reduction in macroscopic crack-to-crack distance, an increase in microscopic
crack coverage, and a widening of the microscopic cracks. However, changes in
the ligament/pore widths with PDMS thickness are negligible, allowing for
independent optimization for cracking. We expect these results to inform the
integration of functional np-Au films on compliant substrates into emerging
applications, including flexible electronics.

<h3>Explaining the Machine Learning Solution of the Ising Model</h3>

<br>
<i>Roberto C. Alamino</i>
<p>As powerful as machine learning (ML) techniques are in solving problems
involving data with large dimensionality, explaining the results from the
fitted parameters remains a challenging task of utmost importance, especially
in physics applications. Here it is shown how this can be accomplished for the
ferromagnetic Ising model, the target of many ML studies in the last years. By
using a neural network (NN) without any hidden layers and the symmetry of the
Hamiltonian to find the critical temperature for the continuous phase
transition of the model, an explanation of its strategy is found. This allows
the prediction of the minimal extension of the NN to solve the problem when the
symmetry is not known, which is also explainable.

<p>A quantum-limited amplification chain is a fundamental advantage for any
application that may benefit from the detection of very faint signals. Reading
out arrays of superconducting detectors (TESs or MKIDs), resonant cavities, or
qubits, calls for large bandwidth amplifiers in addition to having the lowest
possible noise. At millikelvin temperatures, Kinetic Inductance Traveling-Wave
Parametric Amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) working in 3-wave-mixing (3WM) and fabricated
from a 20 nm thick NbTiN film have shown promising noise performances, as they
can operate close to the quantum limit. However, they still require fairly high
pump power. Devices that would require lower pump power would be easier to
implement in readout chains, could reach the quantum limit and they would be
compatible with qubit readout. A possible solution for obtaining this optimal
configuration is to use a thinner superconducting film. In this work we explore
the properties of NbTiN films with a thickness less than 20 nm and we report
the obtained experimental characterizations in terms of critical temperature,
normal resistivity, and kinetic inductance. A new design for a 3WM KI-TWPA
amplifier, based on these developed superconducting films, is introduced and
discussed.

<h3>Double-$Q$ and quadruple-$Q$ instabilities at low-symmetric ordering  wave vectors under tetragonal symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>Multiple-$Q$ states are expressed as a superposition of spin density waves at
multiple ordering wave vectors, which results in unconventional complicated
spin textures, such as skyrmion, hedgehog, and vortex. We investigate the
multiple-$Q$ instability by focusing on the low-symmetric ordering wave vectors
in momentum space. By systematically performing the simulated annealing for
effective spin models with various ordering wave vectors on a two-dimensional
square lattice, we classify the magnetic phase diagram into four types
according to the position of the ordering wave vectors. Three out of four cases
lead to a plethora of isotropic multiple-$Q$ instabilities yielding collinear,
coplanar, and noncoplanar double-$Q$ and quadruple-$Q$ magnetic phases, while
the remaining case leads to an anisotropic double-$Q$ instability when the
multiple-spin interaction is introduced. Our results indicate that exotic
multiple-$Q$ phases distinct from the skyrmion crystal phase are expected when
the ordering wave vectors lie on the low-symmetric positions in the Brillouin
zone.

<h3>Majorana bound state induced drag current in capacitively coupled  quantum dots</h3>

<i>Xiao Xiao, Jian-Xin Zhu</i>
<p>We show that nonzero drag current in a double quantum-dot system, consisting
of a biased drive dot and an unbiased passive dot coupled capacitively, can be
generated by a Majorana bound state located at one of the leads connected to
the passive dot. Importantly, the drag current induced by Majorana bound
states, either an isolated Majorana bound state or two weakly coupled but
spatially separated Majorana modes, shows qualitative differences from that
induced by a near-zero-energy Andereev bound state. Thus, other than the
tunneling spectroscopy, the proposed setup can serve as a complementary tool to
detect Majorana fermions in proximitized Rashba nanowires.

<i>Rafael Luque Merino, Dumitru Calugaru, Haoyu Hu, Jaime Diez-Merida, Andres Diez-Carlon, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Paul Seifert, B. Andrei Bernevig, Dmitri K. Efetov</i>
<p>It has been recently postulated, that the strongly correlated flat bands of
magicangle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) can host coexisting heavy and light
carriers. While transport and spectroscopic measurements have shown hints of
this behavior, a more direct experimental proof is still lacking. Here, we
explore the thermoelectric response of MATBG through the photo-thermoelectric
(PTE) effect in gate-defined MATBG pn-junctions. At low temperatures, we
observe sign-preserving, fillingdependent oscillations of the Seebeck
coefficient at non-zero integer fillings of the moir\'e lattice, which suggest
the preponderance of one carrier type despite tuning the Fermi level from hole
to electron doping of the correlated insulator. Furthermore, at higher
temperatures, the thermoelectric response provides distinct evidence of the
strong electron correlations in the unordered, normal state. We show that our
observations are naturally accounted for by the interplay of light and
long-lived and heavy and short-lived electron bands near the Fermi level at
non-zero integer fillings. Our observations firmly establish the electron and
hole asymmetry of the correlated gaps in MATBG, and shows excellent qualitative
agreement with the recently developed topological heavy fermion model (THF).

<p>We define bipartite and monopartite relational networks of chemical elements
and compounds using two different datasets of inorganic chemical and material
compounds, as well as study their topology. We discover that the connectivity
between elements and compounds is distributed exponentially for materials, and
with a fat tail for chemicals. Compounds networks show similar distribution of
degrees, and feature a highly-connected club due to oxygen. Chemical compounds
networks appear more modular than material ones, while the communities detected
reveal different dominant elements specific to the topology. We successfully
reproduce the connectivity of the empirical chemicals and materials networks by
using a family of fitness models, where the fitness values are derived from the
abundances of the elements in the aggregate compound data. Our results pave the
way towards a relational network-based understanding of the inherent complexity
of the vast chemical knowledge atlas, and our methodology can be applied to
other systems with the ingredient-composite structure.

<br>
<i>Shivam Dangwal, Kaveh Edalati</i>
<p>The development of alloys that are hydrogenated and dehydrogenated quickly
and actively at room temperature is a challenge for the safe and compact
storage of hydrogen. In this study, a new high-entropy alloy (HEA) with AB-type
configuration (A: hydride-forming elements, B: inert-to-hydrogen elements) was
designed by considering valence electron concentration, electronegativity
difference and atomic-size mismatch of elements. The alloy TiV2ZrCrMnFeNi had
dual C14 Laves and BCC phases, in which C14 stored hydrogen and BCC/C14
interphase boundaries contributed to activation. The alloy absorbed 1.6 wt% of
hydrogen at room temperature without any activation treatment and exhibited
fast kinetics and full reversibility.

<h3>Significance of interphase boundaries on activation of high-entropy  alloys for room-temperature hydrogen storage</h3>

<br>
<i>Shivam Dangwal, Kaveh Edalati</i>
<p>The ability of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) for hydrogen storage is a rather
new topic in the hydrogen community. HEAs with the C14 Laves phase have shown a
high potential to reversibly store hydrogen at room temperature, but most of
these alloys require a high-temperature activation treatment. This study
explores the role of interphase boundaries on the easy activation of HEAs at
room temperature. Two chemically similar HEAs with single and dual phases,
TiV1.5ZrCr0.5MnFeNi (C14 + 4 vol% BCC phases) and TiV1.5Zr1.5CrMnFeNi (single
C14 phase), are designed and synthesized. While the dual-phase alloy readily
absorbs hydrogen at room temperature without any activation treatment, the
single-phase alloy requires a high-temperature activation. It is suggested that
interphase boundaries not only provide pathways for easy hydrogen transport and
activation of HEAs at room temperature but also act as active sites for
heterogeneous nucleation of hydride. This study introduces interphase-boundary
generation as an effective strategy to address the activation drawback of HEAs.

<h3>Breaks in the Hall-Petch Relationship after Severe Plastic Deformation  of Magnesium, Aluminum, Copper, and Iron</h3>

<br>
<i>Shivam Dangwal, Kaveh Edalati, Ruslan Z. Valiev, Terence G. Langdon</i>
<p>Strengthening by grain refinement via the Hall-Petch mechanism and softening
by nanograin formation via the inverse Hall-Petch mechanism have been the
subject of argument for decades, particularly for ultrafine-grained materials.
In this study, the Hall-Petch relationship is examined for ultrafine-grained
magnesium, aluminum, copper, and iron produced by severe plastic deformation in
the literature. Magnesium, aluminum, copper, and their alloys follow the
Hall-Petch relationship with a low slope, but an up-break appears when the
grain sizes are reduced below 500-1000 nm. This extra strengthening, which is
mainly due to the enhanced contribution of dislocations, is followed by a
down-break for grain sizes smaller than 70-150 nm due to the diminution of the
dislocation contribution and an enhancement of thermally-activated phenomena.
For pure iron with a lower dislocation mobility, the Hall-Petch breaks are not
evident, but the strength at the nanometer grain size range is lower than the
expected Hall-Petch trend in the submicrometer range. The strength of
nanograined iron can be increased to the expected trend by stabilizing grain
boundaries via impurity atoms. Detailed analyses of the data confirm that grain
refinement to the nanometer level is not necessarily a solution to achieve
extra strengthening, but other strategies such as microstructural stabilization
by segregation or precipitation are required.

<i>Hoshu Hiyane, Thomas Busch, Thomás Fogarty</i>
<p>Strongly correlated impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
can form a periodic structure of tightly localized single atoms due to
competing inter- and intra-species interactions, leading to a self-organized
pinned state. In this work, we show numerically that the impurities in the
self-pinned state form a soliton-train, as a consequence of a BEC-mediated
attractive self-interaction and ordering due to the exclusion principle. The
dynamics of the impurities possess similar characteristics to bright
matter-wave solitons as they appear in attractive BECs, however in the few
impurities case, the detailed nature of collisions is determined by their
quantum statistics.

<br>
<i>Hui Hu, Jia Wang, Xia-Ji Liu</i>
<p>We develop a general theory of Fermi polarons at nonzero temperature,
including particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea shake-up to arbitrarily
high orders. The exact set of equations of the spectral function is derived by
using both Chevy ansatz and diagrammatic approach, and their equivalence is
clarified to hold in free space only, with an unregularized infinitesimal
interaction strength. The correction to the polaron spectral function arising
from two-particle-hole excitations is explicitly examined, for an exemplary
case of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional optical lattices. We find
quantitative improvements at low temperatures with the inclusion of
two-particle-hole excitations, in both polaron energies and decay rates. Our
exact theory of Fermi polarons with arbitrary orders of particle-hole
excitations might be used to better understand the intriguing polaron dynamical
responses in two or three dimensions, whether in free space or within lattices.

<br>
<i>Hao Shi, Wangqian Miao, Xi Dai</i>
<p>Electron-phonon coupling in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is an
important but difficult topic. We propose a scheme to simplify and understand
this problem. Weighted by the coupling strength with the low-energy heavy
electrons ($f$ orbitals), several moir\'{e} optical phonons are singled out
which strongly couple to the flat bands. These modes have localized envelopes
in the moir\'{e} scale, while in the atomic scale they inherit the monolayer
oscillations like the Kekul\'{e} pattern. They flip the flavor of $f$ orbitals,
helping stabilize some symmetry-breaking orders. Such electron-phonon couplings
are incorporated into an effective extended Holstein model, where both phonons
and electrons are written as moir\'{e} scale basis. We hope this model will
inspire some insights guiding further studies about the superconductivity and
other correlated effects in this system.

<i>L. Weissitsch, S. Wurster, H. Krenn, A. Bachmaier</i>
<p>The ferromagnetic {\alpha}-MnBi phase as non-rare earth magnetic material has
gained increasing interest, but fabrication of large volumes containing a
significant amount of {\alpha}-MnBi is still challenging. Targeting successful
processing strategies, we apply multistep severe plastic deformation with
intermediate magnetic field assisted annealing. The subsequent severe plastic
deformation renewed the high amount of material defects and lead to
microstructural refinement of the previously formed {\alpha}-MnBi phase. Thus,
{\alpha}-MnBi phase content is enhanced during final annealing. Secondly, the
magnetic coercivity increases. These results suggest that further optimization
will pave the way towards non-rare-earth bulk magnetic materials with enhanced
{\alpha}-MnBi phase content.

<h3>The kagome Hubbard model from a functional renormalization group  perspective</h3>

<i>Jonas B. Profe, Lennart Klebl, Francesco Grandi, Hendrik Hohmann, Matteo Dürrnagel, Tilman Schwemmer, Ronny Thomale, Dante M. Kennes</i>
<p>The recent discovery of a variety of intricate electronic order in kagome
metals has sprouted significant theoretical and experimental interest. From an
electronic perspective on the potential microscopic origin of these phases, the
most basic model is given by a Hubbard model on the kagome lattice. We employ
functional renormalization group (FRG) to analyze the kagome Hubbard model.
Through our methodological refinement of FRG both within its N-patch and
truncated unity formulation, we resolve previous discrepancies of different FRG
approaches (Wang et al., 2013 vs. Kiesel et al., 2013), and analyze both the
pure ($p$-type) and mixed ($m$-type) van Hove fillings of the kagome lattice.
We further study the RG flow into symmetry broken phases to identify the
energetically preferred linear combination of the respective order parameter
without any need for additional mean field analysis. Our findings suggest some
consistency with recent experiments, and underline the richness of electronic
phases already found in the kagome Hubbard model. We also provide a no-go
theorem for a complex charge bond ordered phase in the single orbital kagome
Hubbard model, suggesting that this model cannot capture aspects of orbital
current phases.

<h3>Unusual Multiple Magnetic Transitions and Anomalous Hall Effect Observed  in Antiferromagnetic Weyl Semimetal, Mn$_{2.94}$Ge (Ge-rich)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11923" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11923</a>
<br>
<i>Susanta Ghosh, Achintya Low, Susmita Changdar, Shubham Purwar, Setti Thirupathaiah</i>
<p>We report on the magnetic and Hall effect measurements of the magnetic Weyl
semimetal, Mn$_{2.94}$Ge (Ge-rich) single crystal. From the magnetic properties
study, we identify unusual multiple magnetic transitions below the
N$\acute{e}$el temperature of 353 K, such as the spin-reorientation ($T_{SR}$)
and ferromagnetic-like transitions. Consistent with the magnetic properties,
the Hall effect study shows unusual behavior around the spin-reorientation
transition. Specifically, the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) increases with
increasing temperature, reaching a maximum at $T_{SR}$, which then gradually
decreases with increasing temperature. This observation is quite in contrast to
the Mn$_{3+\delta}$Ge (Mn-rich) system, though both compositions share the same
hexagonal crystal symmetry. This study unravels the sensitivity of magnetic and
topological properties on the Mn concentration.

<i>Edmond Orignac</i>
<p>We consider an antiferromagnetic four leg spin-1/2 tube using abelian and
non-abelian bosonization. We show that in the limit of weak interchain
coupling, the most relevant interaction gives rise to an emergent SU(3)}
symmetry, broken only by marginal interactions that can be canceled by diagonal
interchain couplings. We discuss the low energy spectrum in the semiclassical
limit and using a mapping to a trimerized SU(3) spin chain. We establish that
the correlation functions of ferroquadrupolar operators can be used to reveal
the emergent symmetry.

<h3>Hyperbolic phonon polaritons and wave vector direction dependent  dielectric tensors in anisotropic crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11956" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11956</a>
<br>
<i>Yue Fang, Huanjun Chen, Zhibing Li, Weiliang Wang</i>
<p>Hyperbolic phonon polariton is important in precisely controlling photons at
the nanoscale. It was common practice to calculate the dielectric function of
the phonon polariton system with the Drude-Lorenz model. We considered the
impact of LO-TO splitting while applying the Drude-Lorenz model. Then the
dielectric functions become wave vector direction dependent besides electric
polarization direction dependent. Our results show that considering LO-TO
splitting can more accurately predict dielectric functions. Additionally, we
discovered that, besides hexagonal BN, hexagonal AlN exhibits a wide hyperbolic
frequency band range, while the other four materials display it scarcely.
Furthermore, we found that the phonon frequency, lifetime, and the difference
of infrared active transverse optical phonon frequencies with different wave
vector directions are critical factors in determining the width of the
hyperbolic frequency band range. We also found some dumbbell-shaped and
butterfly-shaped isofrequency curves in h-AlN, h-GaP, and especially h-GaN. Our
study provides a fresh perspective on understanding the dielectric properties
of these materials and lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration
and development of new hyperbolic phonon polariton materials.

<h3>Tagged particle behavior in a harmonic chain of direction reversing  active Brownian particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11964</a>
<br>
<i>Shashank Prakash, Urna Basu, Sanjib Sabhapandit</i>
<p>We study the tagged particle dynamics in a harmonic chain of direction
reversing active Brownian particles, with spring constant $k$, rotation
diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{r}}$, and directional reversal rate $\gamma$.
We exactly compute the tagged particle position variance for quenched and
annealed initial orientations of the particles. For well-separated time scales,
$k^{-1}$, $D_{\text{r}}^{-1}$ and $\gamma^{-1}$, the strength of spring
constant $k$ relative to $D_{\text{r}}$ and $\gamma$ gives rise to different
coupling limits and for each coupling limit there are short, intermediate, and
long time regimes. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that, to the leading
order, the tagged particle variance exhibits an algebraic growth $t^{\nu}$,
where the value of the exponent $\nu$ depends on the specific regime. For a
quenched initial orientation, the exponent $\nu$ crosses over from $3$ to
$1/2$, via intermediate values $5/2$ or $1$, depending on the specific coupling
limits. On the other hand, for the annealed initial orientation, $\nu$ crosses
over from $2$ to $1/2$ via an intermediate value $3/2$ or $1$ for strong
coupling limit and weak coupling limit respectively. An additional time scale
$t_N=N^2/k$ emerges for a system with a finite number of oscillators $N$. We
show that the behavior of the tagged particle variance across $t_N$ can be
expressed in terms of a crossover scaling function, which we find exactly.
Finally, we characterize the stationary state behavior of the separation
between two consecutive particles by calculating the corresponding
spatio-temporal correlation function.

<i>Hemanshul Garg, Pier Giuseppe Ledda, Jon Skov Pedersen, Matteo Pezzulla</i>
<p>We study the buckling of a clamped beam immersed in a creeping flow within a
rectangular channel. Via a combination of precision experiments, simulations,
and theoretical modeling, we show how the instability depends on a pressure
feedback mechanism and rationalize it in terms of dimensionless parameters. As
the beam can bend until touching the wall above a critical flow rate, we
finally demonstrate how the system can be used as a tunable passive flow
selector, effectively redirecting the flow within a designed hydraulic circuit.

<h3>Construction of optimized tight-binding models using \textit{ab initio}  Hamiltonian: Application to monolayer $2H$-transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11969" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11969</a>
<br>
<i>Sejoong Kim</i>
<p>We present optimized tight-binding models with atomic orbitals to improve
\textit{ab initio} tight-binding models constructed by truncating full density
functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian based on localized orbitals. Retaining
qualitative features of the original Hamiltonian, the optimization reduces
quantitative deviations in overall band structures between the \textit{ab
initio} tight-binding model and the full DFT Hamiltonian. The optimization
procedure and related details are demonstrated by using semiconducting and
metallic Janus transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers in the $2H$
configuration. Varying the truncation range from partial second neighbors to
third ones, we show differences in electronic structures between the truncated
tight-binding model and the original full Hamiltonian, and how much the
optimization can remedy the quantitative loss induced by truncation. We further
elaborate the optimization process so that local electronic properties such as
valence and conduction band edges and Fermi surfaces are precisely reproduced
by the optimized tight-binding model. We also extend our discussions to
tight-binding models including spin-orbit interactions, so we provide the
optimized tight-binding model replicating spin-related properties of the
original Hamiltonian such as spin textures. The optimization process described
here can be readily applied to construct the fine-tuned tight-binding model
based on various DFT calculations.

<h3>Non-magnetic layers with a single Dirac cone at high-symmetry point of  the Brillouin zone</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11982" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11982</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimir Damljanovic</i>
<p>It is well known that a single Dirac cone at high-symmetry point (HSP) of a
Brillouin zone, akin to the one in graphenes' band structure, can not appear as
the only quasiparticle at the Fermi level in two-dimensional (2D), non-magnetic
materials. Here we found two layer groups with time-reversal symmetry, among
all possible both without- and with spin-orbit coupling, that host one Dirac
cone at HSP and we show which additional dispersions appear: a pair of Dirac
lines on opposite BZ edges and a pair of Dirac cones that can be moved but not
removed by symmetry preserving perturbations, on the other two BZ edges. We
illustrate our theory by a tight-binding band structure and discuss real 2D
materials that belong to one of the two symmetry groups. Finally, we single out
inconsistencies in the literature showing that it is better to focus scientist
attention to a research topics itself, instead to group of authors only (e.g.
from one university, country etc.) dealing with the same topics. On the other
hand, repetitions of other scientist results without due citation, destroys the
spirit of science itself.

<br>
<i>Hengxuan Jiang, Xiumei Wang, Jie Chen, Xingping Zhou</i>
<p>We investigate the emergence of unconventional corner mode in a
two-dimensional topolectrical circuits induced by asymmetric couplings. The
non-Hermitian skin effect of two kinked one-dimensional lattices with multiple
asymmetric couplings are explored. Then we extend to the two-dimensional model,
derive conditions for the non-Hermitian hybrid skin effect and show how the
corner modes are formed by non-reciprocal pumping based on one-dimensional
topological modes. We provide explicit electrical circuit setups for realizing
our observations via realistic LTspice simulation. Moreover, we show the time
varying behaviors of voltage distributions to confirm our results. Our study
may help to extend the knowledge on building the topological corner modes in
the non-Hermitian presence.

<h3>Broadband ferromagnetic resonance in Mn-doped Li ferrite nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Hernandez-Gomez, J.M. Muñoz, M.A. Valente, M.P.F. Graça</i>
<p>Lithium ferrites are well known materials due to their numerous technological
applications especially in microwave devices. Mn-doped lithium ferrite
nanoparticles were prepared by sol-gel technique by means of Pechini method,
and then annealed at different temperatures in 250 to 1000 {\deg}C range. XRD
confirms spinel formation with particle size in the 15 to 200 nm range, with
increased size with annealing temperature. Microwave magnetoabsorption data of
annealed lithium ferrite nanoparticles, obtained with a broadband system based
on a network analyzer operating up to 8.5 GHz are presented. At fields up to
200 mT we can observe a broad absorption peak that shifts to higher frequencies
with magnetic field according to ferromagnetic resonance theory. The amplitude
of absorption, up to 85%, together with the frequency width of about 4.5 GHz
makes this material suitable as wave absorber. Samples annealed at higher
temperatures show a behaviour similar to polycrystalline samples, thus
suggesting their multidomain character

<p>Quantum magnonics investigates the quantum-mechanical properties of magnons
such as quantum coherence or entanglement for solid-state quantum information
technologies at the nanoscale. The most promising material for quantum
magnonics is the ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), which hosts magnons
with the longest lifetimes. YIG films of the highest quality are grown on a
paramagnetic gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate. The literature has
reported that ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequencies of YIG/GGG decrease at
temperatures below 50 K despite the increase in YIG magnetization. We
investigated a 97 nm-thick YIG film grown on 500 $\mathrm{\mu}$m-thick GGG
substrate through a series of experiments conducted at temperatures as low as
30 mK, and using both analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest
that the primary factor contributing to the FMR frequency shift is the stray
magnetic field created by the partially magnetized GGG substrate. This stray
field is antiparallel to the applied external field and is highly
inhomogeneous, reaching up to 40 mT in the center of the sample. At
temperatures below 500 mK, the GGG field exhibits a saturation that cannot be
described by the standard Brillouin function for a paramagnet. Including the
calculated GGG field in the analysis of the FMR frequency versus temperature
dependence allowed the determination of the cubic and uniaxial anisotropies. We
find that the total anisotropy increases more than three times with the
decrease in temperature down to 2 K. Our findings enable accurate predictions
of the YIG/GGG magnetic systems behavior at low and ultra-low millikelvin
temperatures, crucial for developing quantum magnonic devices.

<h3>Topological Phase Diagram of Optimally Shaken Honeycomb Lattices: A Dual  Perspective from Stroboscopic and Non-Stroboscopic Floquet Hamiltonians</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12113" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12113</a>
<br>
<i>Álvaro R. Puente-Uriona, Giulio Pettini, Michele Modugno</i>
<p>We present a direct comparison between the stroboscopic and non-stroboscopic
effective approaches for ultracold atoms in shaken honeycomb lattices, focusing
specifically on the optimal driving introduced by A. Verdeny and F. Mintert
[Phys. Rev. A 92, 063615 (2015)]. In the fast-driving regime, we compare the
effective non-stroboscopic Hamiltonian derived through a perturbative expansion
with a non-perturbative calculation of the stroboscopic Floquet Hamiltonian,
obtained through a simple non-perturbative numerical approach. We show that
while some of the tunneling parameters are inherently model-dependent, the
topological properties of the system remains robust, as expected. Using the
same numerical approach we compute the topological phase diagram, arguing that
it is most effectively represented in terms of the physical parameters
characterizing the driving and the bare Hamiltonian -- parameters directly
accessible in experiments -- rather than the emergent tunneling parameters,
that depend on the model representation.

<h3>Intrinsic anomalous and crystal Hall effects in altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12115" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12115</a>
<br>
<i>Lotan Attias, Alex Levchenko, Maxim Khodas</i>
<p>We construct the tight-binding model of the altermagnet in the presence of a
finite spin-orbit interaction. As a concrete example, we have studied the
collinear FeSb$_2$. The Fe ions form two sublattices with opposite spin
polarization. Inclusion of the intra-sublattice hopping amplitudes up to the
next-to-nearest neighbor results in the generic model free of accidental
degeneracies. The zero spin-orbit interaction limit is achieved by elimination
of spin dependent hopping amplitudes. The additional band degeneracies in this
limit are shown to coincide with the prediction of spin symmetry. The minimal
one-orbital model gives rise to four bands due to two sublattices and two spin
orientations. We have constructed a simplified two-band description valid in
the limit of large exchange splitting. Close to the center of the Brillouin
Zone, it reduces to the $\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{p}$-type Hamiltonian. Based on
this Hamiltonian, we have computed the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous
Hall conductivity. In a metallic limit, the result can be expressed
analytically in terms of the two-kinds of spin splitting: one associated with
the altermagnetism, and the other originating from the spin orbit interaction.

<h3>Still mystery after all these years -- Unconventional superconductivity  of Sr2RuO4 --</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12117</a>
<br>
<i>Yoshiteru Maeno, Shingo Yonezawa, Aline Ramires</i>
<p>This review describes recent significant research developments made on the
layered perovskite Sr2RuO4 and discusses current issues from both experimental
and theoretical perspectives. Since the discovery of superconductivity in
Sr2RuO4 in 1994, studies using high-quality single crystals quickly revealed it
to be an archetypal unconventional superconductor among strongly correlated
electron systems. In particular, it was thought that the spin-triplet chiral
p-wave superconducting state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, was a
prominent possibility. In 2019, however, a new development overturned the past
experimental results, and spin-singlet-like behavior became conclusive.
Furthermore, innovation in uniaxial strain devices has stimulated researchers
to explore changes in the superconducting state by controlling the symmetry and
dimensionality of the Fermi surfaces and enhancing the superconducting
transition temperature Tc from 1.5 K to 3.5 K. A spin-singlet chiral d-wave
superconducting state is consistent with most of these recent experimental
results. Nevertheless, there are still unnatural aspects that remain to be
explained. The focus of this review is on unraveling this mystery. Unlike many
other unconventional superconductors, the normal state of Sr2RuO4 exhibits
typical Fermi liquid behavior. Nevertheless, to elucidate its superconducting
state, it may be essential to go beyond the traditional framework of
unconventional superconductivity and recast the theory explicitly considering
the multi-orbital aspects of its electronic states. In this review, we describe
the frontiers of superconductivity research in Sr2RuO4 and discuss how the
remaining issues may be resolved.

<h3>Vacancy-Induced Topological Fano Resonance in Kane-Mele Nanoribbons:  Design, Control, and Sensing Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12119" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12119</a>
<br>
<i>S. Jalilvand, M. Soltani, Z. Noorinejad, M. Amini, E. Ghanbari-Adivi</i>
<p>The concept of topological Fano resonance, characterized by an ultrasharp
asymmetric line shape, is a promising candidate for robust sensing applications
due to its sensitivity to external parameters and immunity to structural
disorder. In this study, the vacancy-induced topological Fano resonance in a
nanoribbon made up of a hexagonal lattice with armchair sides is examined by
introducing several on-site vacancies, which are deliberately created at
regular distances, along a zigzag chain that stretches across the width of the
ribbon. The presence of the on-site vacancies can create localized energy
states within the electronic band structure, leading to the formation of an
impurity band, which can result in Fano resonance phenomena by forming a
conductivity channel between the edge modes on both armchair sides of the
ribbon. Consequently, an ultracompact tunable on-chip integrated topological
Fano resonance derived from the graphene-based nanomechanical phononic crystals
is proposed. The Fano resonance arises from the interference between
topologically protected even and odd edge modes at the interface between
trivial and nontrivial insulators in a nanoribbon structure governed by the
Kane-Mele model describing the quantum spin Hall effect in hexagonal lattices.
The simulation of the topological Fano resonance is performed analytically
using the Lippmann-Schwinger scattering formulation. One of the advantages of
the present study is that the related calculations are carried out
analytically, and in addition to the simplicity and directness, it reproduces
the results obtained from the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formulation very well both
quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings open up possibilities for the
design of highly sensitive and accurate robust sensors for detecting extremely
tiny forces, masses, and spatial positions.

<i>Alex V. Plyukhin</i>
<p>We consider a classical Brownian oscillator of mass $m$ driven from an
arbitrary initial state by varying the stiffness $k(t)$ of the harmonic
potential according to the protocol $k(t)=k_0+a\,\delta(t)$, involving the
Dirac delta function. The microscopic work performed on the oscillator is shown
to be $W=(a^2/2m)\,q^2-a q v$, where $q$ and $v$ are the coordinate and
velocity in the initial state. If the initial distribution of $q$ and $v$ is
the equilibrium one with temperature $T$, the average work is $\langle W
\rangle=a^2T/(2m\,k_0)$ and the distribution $f(W)$ has the form of the product
of exponential and modified Bessel functions. The distribution is asymmetric
and diverges as $W\to 0$. The system's response for $t>0$ is evaluated for
specific models.

<br>
<i>Mirko Daumann, Thomas Dahm</i>
<p>We study the broadening of initially localized wave packets in a quasi
one-dimensional diamond ladder with interacting, spinless fermions. The lattice
possesses a flat band causing localization. We place special focus on the
transition away from the flat band many-body localized case by adding very weak
dispersion. By doing so, we allow propagation of the wave packet on
significantly different timescales which causes anomalous diffusion. Due to the
temporal separation of dynamic processes, an interaction-induced, prethermal
equilibrium becomes apparent. A physical picture of light and heavy modes for
this prethermal behavior can be obtained within Born-Oppenheimer approximation
via basis transformation of the original Hamiltonian. This reveals a detachment
between light, symmetric and heavy, anti-symmetric particle species. We show
that the prethermal state is characterized by heavy particles binding together
mediated by the light particles.

<h3>Nanomechanical crystalline AlN resonators with high quality factors for  quantum optoelectromechanics</h3>

<br>
<i>Anastasiia Ciers, Alexander Jung, Joachim Ciers, Laurentius Radit Nindito, Hannes Pfeifer, Armin Dadgar, Andre Strittmatter, Witlef Wieczorek</i>
<p>High-$Q_m$ mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise
and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity
optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the
material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering
techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have
been employed for high-$Q_m$ mechanical resonators made from amorphous
materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si.
A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the
capability of high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize
electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical
resonators with $Q_m$ up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained 290
nm-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering
strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit
dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a $Q_m \times f_m$-product
approaching $10^{13}$ Hz at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator
geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central
pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical
reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The
presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at
room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.

<i>Yoshihiko Hasegawa</i>
<p>We present a concentration inequality in stochastic thermodynamics that
provides a lower bound for the probability distribution of observables in
Markov processes, where the lower bound includes the dynamical activity, a
central thermodynamic quantity in trade-off relations. The derived inequality
is called the thermodynamic concentration inequality. As a first corollary of
the thermodynamic concentration inequality, by combining it with the Markov
inequality, we derive an upper bound on the expectation of an observable given
its maximum. Furthermore, as a second corollary, we obtain a generalization of
the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, where the first and second moments of
the original relation are replaced by the $p$-norm. These corollaries are valid
for an arbitrary Markov process with time-dependent transition rates and for an
arbitrary initial probability distribution. The thermodynamic concentration
inequality provides the foundation for discovering trade-off relations.

<h3>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Anisotropic Particles Accelerated by  Neural-Net Predicted Interactions</h3>

<i>B. Rusen Argun, Yu Fu, Antonia Statt</i>
<p>Rigid bodies, made of smaller composite beads, are commonly used to simulate
anisotropic particles with molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods. To
accurately represent the particle shape and to obtain smooth and realistic
effective pair interactions between two rigid bodies, each body may need to
contain hundreds of spherical beads. Given an interacting pair of particles,
traditional MD methods calculate the inter-body distances between the beads of
the rigid bodies within a certain distance. For a system containing many
anisotropic particles, distance calculations are computationally costly and
limit the attainable system size and simulation time. However, the effective
interaction between two rigid particles only depends on the distance between
their center of masses and their relative orientation. Therefore, a function
directly mapping the center of mass distance and orientation to the interaction
energy between the two rigid bodies, would completely bypass inter-bead
distance calculations. It is challenging to derive such a general function
analytically for most non-spherical rigid bodies. We have trained neural nets,
powerful tools to fit nonlinear functions to complex datasets, to achieve this
task. The pair configuration is taken as input and the energy, forces and
torques between two rigid particles are predicted directly. We show that MD
simulations of cubes and cylinders performed with forces and torques obtained
from the gradients of the energy neural-nets quantitatively match traditional
simulations that uses composite rigid bodies. Both structural quantities and
dynamic measures are in agreement, while achieving up to 23 times speed up over
traditional molecular dynamics, depending on hardware and system size. The
method can, in principle, be applied to any irregular shape with any pair
interaction, provided that sufficient training data can be obtained.

<h3>Dislike of general opinion makes for tight elections</h3>

<i>Olivier Devauchelle, Piotr Szymczak, Piotr Nowakowski</i>
<p>In modern democracies, the outcome of elections and referendums is often
remarkably tight. The repetition of these divisive events are the hallmark of a
split society; to the physicist, however, it is an astonishing feat for such
large collections of diverse individuals. Many sociophysics models reproduce
the emergence of collective human behavior with interacting agents, which
respond to their environment according to simple rules, modulated by random
fluctuations. A paragon of this class is the Ising model which, when
interactions are strong, predicts that order can emerge from a chaotic initial
state. In contrast with many elections, however, this model favors a strong
majority. Here, we introduce a new element to this classical theory, which
accounts for the influence of opinion polls on the electorate. This brings
about a new phase in which two groups divide the opinion equally. These
political camps are spatially segregated, and the sharp boundary that separates
them makes the system size-dependent, even in the limit of a large electorate.
Election data show that, over the last 30 years, countries with more than about
a million voters often found themselves in this state, whereas elections in
smaller countries yielded more consensual results. We suggest that this
transition hinges on the electorate's awareness of the general opinion.

<p>Intermolecular interactions are crucial in determining the morphology of
solution-processed semiconducting polymer thin films. However, these random
interactions often lead to disordered or short-range ordered structures.
Achieving long-range order in these films has been a challenge due to limited
control over microscopic interactions in current techniques. Here, we present a
molecular-level methodology that leverages spatial matching of intermolecular
dynamics among solutes, solvents, and substrates to induce directional
molecular assembly in weakly bonded polymers. Within the optimized dynamic
scale of 2.5 \r{A} between polymer side chains and self-assembled monolayers
(SAMs) on nanogrooved substrates, our approach transforms random aggregates
into unidirectional fibers with a remarkable increase in the anisotropic
stacking ratio from 1 to 11. The Flory-Huggins-based molecular stacking model
accurately predicts the transitioning order on various SAMs, validated by
morphologic and spectroscopic observations. The enhanced structural ordering
spans over 3 orders of magnitude in length, raising from the smallest 7.3 nm
random crystallites to >14 um unidirectional fibers on sub-millimeter areas.
Overall, this study provides insights into the control of complex
intermolecular interactions and offers enhanced molecular-level controllability
in solution-based processes.

<p>Grain boundary (GB) properties greatly influence the mechanical, electrical,
and thermal response of polycrystalline materials. Most computational studies
of GB properties at finite temperatures use molecular dynamics (MD), which is
computationally expensive, limited in the range of accessible timescales, and
requires cumbersome techniques like thermodynamic integration to estimate free
energies. This restricts the reasonable computation (without incurring
excessive computational expense) of GB properties to regimes that are often
unrealistic, such as zero temperature or extremely high strain rates.
Consequently, there is a need for simulation methodology that avoids the
timescale limitations of MD, while providing reliable estimates of GB
properties. The Gaussian Phase-Packet (GPP) method is a temporal
coarse-graining technique that can predict relaxed atomic structures at finite
temperature in the quasistatic limit. This work applies GPP, combined with the
quasiharmonic approximation for computing the free energy, to the problem of
determining the free energy and shear coupling factor of grain boundaries in
metals over a range of realistic temperatures. Validation is achieved by
comparison to thermodynamic integration, which confirms that the presented
approach captures relaxed-energy GB structures and shear coupling factors at
finite temperature with a high degree of accuracy.

<p>While the mechanical behavior of noble nanoporous metals has been the subject
of numerous studies, less is known about their recently developed
refractory-based counterparts. Here we report on the mechanical properties,
deformation mechanisms and topological changes of nanoporous tantalum, a
prototypical refractory metal, by means of atomistic simulations of compression
tests. An open-source multi-cpu and gpu-capable software is presented and used
for the generation of computational samples. The stress strain curves show a
non-linear elastic response, with early yielding. The plastic regime is first
characterized by a linear hardening followed by an exponential hardening at
large strains, associated with a high degree of densification. Plasticity is
dominated by dislocation activity, with twinning and vacancy formation
appearing as complementary deformation mechanisms. In order to study the
mechanical response from a topological perspective, we track the evolution of
the genus throughout the tests, finding direct correlations with each regime of
the stress strain curves. The results are in agreement with previous studies of
plasticity in nanoporous metals and highlight the importance of using
topological metrics, for gaining insights into complex aspects of the
deformation of nanoporous metals.

<p>Ever since the initial experimental observation of correlated insulators and
superconductivity in the flat Dirac bands of magic angle twisted bilayer
graphene, a search for the microscopic description that explains its strong
electronic interactions has begun. While the seemingly disagreeing electronic
transport and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments suggest a dichotomy
between local and extended electronic orbitals, definitive experimental
evidence merging the two patterns together has been much sought after. Here, we
report on the local photothermoelectric measurements in the flat electronic
bands of twisted symmetric trilayer graphene (TSTG). We use a cryogenic
scanning near-field optical microscope with an oscillating atomic force
microscopy (AFM) tip irradiated by the infrared photons to create a nanoscopic
hot spot in the planar samples, which generates a photocurrent that we probe
globally. We observe a breakdown of the non-interacting Mott formalism at low
temperatures (10K), signaling the importance of the electronic interactions.
Our measurements reveal an overall negative offset of the Seebeck coefficient
and significant peaks of the local photovoltage values at all positive integer
fillings of the TSTG's moir\'e superlattice, further indicating a substantial
deviation from the classical two-band semiconductor Seebeck response. We
explain these observations using the interacting topological heavy-fermion
model. In addition, our data reveal a spatial variation of the relative
interaction strength dependent on the measured local twist angle (1.2{\deg} -
1.6{\deg}). Our findings provide experimental evidence of heavy fermion
behaviour in the topological flat bands of moir\'e graphene and epitomize an
avenue to apply local thermoelectric measurements to other strongly correlated
materials in the disorder-free limit.

<h3>Simple model for the kinetics of stimuli-responsive gels with porous  structures</h3>

<p>Stimuli-responsive gels are the gels that vary the volume depending on
environmental conditions. It has been reported that the stimuli-responsive gel
with an inhomogeneous structure exhibits faster volume change than the gel
without it. It is understood as a difference in the transfer dynamics of the
solvent, though, there are few models for discussing the effect of
inhomogeneity explicitly. In this paper, we propose a simple model for the
kinetics of volume change by introducing inhomogeneity as the probability
distribution for a random variable that characterizes the structure. Under this
framework, we demonstrate that inhomogeneity actually increases the rate of
volume change. Furthermore, through analysis of a simplified example, we show
that some features that are often seen in experiments can be reproduced by the
model. This model provides a simple equation for the time series of volume
change that can be used to characterize the experimental data based on a simple
physical picture of the phenomenon.

<p>Metal alloys hold the promise of providing hot carrier generation
distributions superior to pure metals in applications such as sensing,
catalysis and solar energy harvesting. Guidelines for finding the optimal alloy
configuration for a target application require understanding the connection
between alloy composition and hot carrier distribution. Here we present a
DFT-based computational approach to investigate the photo-generated hot carrier
distribution of metal alloys based on the joint density of states and the
electronic structure. We classified the metals by their electronic structure
into closed d-shell, open d-shell, p-block and s-block elements. It is shown
that combining closed d-shell elements enables modulating the distribution of
highly energetic holes typical of pure metals but also leads to hot carrier
production by IR light excitation and the appearance of highly energetic
electrons due to band folding and splitting. This feature arises as an emergent
property of alloying and is only unveiled when the hot carrier distribution
computation takes momentum conservation into account. The combination of closed
d-shell with open d-shell elements allows an abundant production of hot
carriers in a broad energy range, while alloying a closed d-shell elements with
an s-block element opens the door to hot electron distribution skewed toward
high energy electrons. The combination of d-shell with p-block elements results
in moderate hot carrier distribution whose asymmetry can be tuned by
composition. Overall, the obtained insights that connect alloy composition,
band structure and resulting carrier distribution provide a toolkit to match
elements in an alloy for the deliberate engineering of hot carrier
distribution.

<h3>Designed spin-texture-lattice to control anisotropic magnon transport in  antiferromagnets</h3>

<p>Spin waves in magnetic materials are promising information carriers for
future computing technologies due to their ultra-low energy dissipation and
long coherence length. Antiferromagnets are strong candidate materials due, in
part, to their stability to external fields and larger group velocities.
Multiferroic aniferromagnets, such as BiFeO$_3$ (BFO), have an additional
degree of freedom stemming from magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for control
of the magnetic structure, and thus spin waves, with electric field.
Unfortunately, spin-wave propagation in BFO is not well understood due to the
complexity of the magnetic structure. In this work, we explore long-range spin
transport within an epitaxially engineered, electrically tunable,
one-dimensional (1D) magnonic crystal. We discover a striking anisotropy in the
spin transport parallel and perpendicular to the 1D crystal axis. Multiscale
theory and simulation suggests that this preferential magnon conduction emerges
from a combination of a population imbalance in its dispersion, as well as
anisotropic structural scattering. This work provides a pathway to
electrically-reconfigurable magnonic crystals in antiferromagnets.

<h3>Emergence of radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted van der Waals  heterostructures</h3>

<p>Rashba spin-orbit coupling is a quintessential spin interaction appearing in
virtually any electronic heterostructure. Its paradigmatic spin texture in the
momentum space forms a tangential vector field. Using first-principles
investigations, we demonstrate that in twisted homobilayers and
hetero-multilayers, the Rashba coupling can be predominantly radial, parallel
to the momentum. Specifically, we study four experimentally relevant
structures: twisted bilayer graphene (Gr), twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, and twisted
multilayers WSe$_2$/Gr/WSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$/Gr/Gr/WSe$_2$. We show, that the
Rashba spin-orbit field texture in such structures can be controlled by an
electric field, allowing to tune it from radial to tangential. Such spin-orbit
engineering should be useful for designing novel spin-charge conversion and
spin-orbit torque schemes, as well as for controlling correlated phases and
superconductivity in van der Waals materials.

<h3>Critical crack-length during fracture</h3>

<p>Through controlled numerical simulations in a one dimensional fiber bundle
model with local stress concentration, we established an inverse correlation
between the strength of the material and the cracks which grow inside it - both
the maximum crack and the one that set in instability within the system,
defined to be the critical crack. Through Pearson correlation function as well
as probabilistic study of individual configurations, we found that the maximum
and the critical crack often differ from each other unless the disorder
strength is extremely low. A phase diagram on the plane of disorder vs system
size demarcates between the regions where the largest crack is the most
vulnerable one and where they differ from each other but still shows moderate
correlation.
