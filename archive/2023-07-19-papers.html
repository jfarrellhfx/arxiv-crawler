<h3>Quantifying Alignment and Quality of Graphene Nanoribbons: A Polarized  Raman Spectroscopy Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09490</a>

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are atomically precise stripes of graphene with
tunable electronic properties, making them promising for room-temperature
switching applications like field-effect transistors (FETs). However,
challenges persist in GNR processing and characterization, particularly
regarding GNR alignment during device integration. In this study, we
quantitatively assess the alignment and quality of 9-atom-wide armchair
graphene nanoribbons (9-AGNRs) on different substrates using polarized Raman
spectroscopy. Our approach incorporates an extended model that describes GNR
alignment through a Gaussian distribution of angles. We not only extract the
angular distribution of GNRs but also analyze polarization-independent
intensity contributions to the Raman signal, providing insights into surface
disorder on the growth substrate and after substrate transfer. Our findings
reveal that low-coverage samples grown on Au(788) exhibit superior uniaxial
alignment compared to high-coverage samples, attributed to preferential growth
along step edges, as confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Upon
substrate transfer, the alignment of low-coverage samples deteriorates,
accompanied by increased surface disorder. On the other hand, high-coverage
samples maintain alignment and exhibit reduced disorder on the target
substrate. Our extended model enables a quantitative description of GNR
alignment and quality, facilitating the development of GNR-based nanoelectronic
devices.

<h3>Exact hole-induced $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in certain $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$  Hubbard models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09500" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09500</a>
<br>
<i>Kyung-Su Kim, Hosho Katsura</i>
<br>
<br>
We prove that the motion of a single hole induces $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in
the $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ (Fermi) Hubbard model on a Husimi-like tree graph. The
result is also generalized to certain $t$-$J$ models with antiferromagnetic
interactions and singlet hopping terms typically neglected in the literature.
This is an $SU(N)$ generalization of the "counter-Nagaoka theorem" introduced
in [Phys. Rev. B 107, L140401 (2023)]. Our results suggest the existence of
antiferromagnetic or resonating-valence-bond (RVB)-like polarons in the $t$-$J$
models on a more realistic non-bipartite lattice. Such antiferromagnetic/RVB
polarons may be relevant for a novel strong-coupling mechanism of
superconductivity or other exotic fractionalized phases of matter.

<h3>Flat-band spin density wave in twisted bilayer materials</h3>

Twisting is a novel technique for creating strongly correlated effects in
two-dimensional bilayered materials, and can tunably generate nontrivial
topological properties, magnetism, and superconductivity. Magnetism is
particularly significant as it can both compete with superconductivity and lead
to the emergence of nontrivial topological states. However, the origin of
magnetism in twisted structures remains a subject of controversy. Using
self-developed large-scale electronic structure calculations, we propose the
magnetism in these twisted bilayer systems originates from spin splitting
induced by the enhanced ratio of the exchange interaction to band dispersion.

<h3>Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09519</a>
<br>
<i>Ying-Hai Wu, Hong-Hao Tu, Meng Cheng</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum
critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can
be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of
freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral
primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the
CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that
the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two
interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs
due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary
states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are
difficult to achieve using previously known methods. Numerical simulations are
performed in two quantum spin chains whose bulks are described by the
SU(3)$_{1}$ and Spin(5)$_{1}$ CFTs and edges are coupled to spin-1/2
impurities. In both cases, low-energy eigenvalues are consistent with
analytical predictions.

<br>
Quasicrystals, a fascinating class of materials with long-range but
nonperiodic order, have revolutionized our understanding of solid-state physics
due to their unique properties at the crossroads of long-range-ordered and
disordered systems. Since their discovery, they continue to spark broad
interest for their structural and electronic properties. The quantum simulation
of quasicrystals in synthetic quantum matter systems offers a unique playground
to investigate these systems with unprecedented control parameters. Here, we
investigate the localization properties and spectral structure of quantum
particles in 2D quasicrystalline optical potentials. While states are generally
localized at low energy and extended at high energy, we find alternating
localized and critical states at intermediate energies. Moreover, we identify a
complex succession of gaps in the energy spectrum. We show that the most
prominent gap arises from strongly localized ring states, with the gap width
determined by the energy splitting between states with different quantized
winding numbers. In addition, we find that these gaps are stable for
quasicrystals with different rotational symmetries and potential depths,
provided that other localized states do not enter the gap generated by the ring
states. Our findings shed light on the unique properties of quantum
quasicrystals and have implications for their many-body counterparts.

<h3>Controllable Creation of Skyrmion Bags in a Ferromagnetic Nanodisk</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09528" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09528</a>
<br>
<i>Lan Bo, Rongzhi Zhao, Chenglong Hu, Xichao Zhang, Xuefeng Zhang, Masahito Mochizuki</i>
<br>
<br>
Skyrmion bags are composed of an outer skyrmion and arbitrary inner
skyrmions, which have recently been observed in bulk chiral magnets, but still
remain elusive in magnetic films. Here, we propose a method of creating
skyrmion bags in a thin-film nanodisk, which includes three steps. Firstly, the
size of outer skyrmion is enlarged by a vertical magnetic field, then inner
skyrmions are nucleated at an off-center area by local current injection, and
the system is finally reconstructed due to multiple inter-skyrmion potentials.
Thus, skyrmion bags with topological charge up to forty can be created.
Simulated Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images are given to
facilitate the experimental demonstration. Our proposal is expected to inspire
relevant experiments in magnetic films, and pave the way for potential
spintronic applications based on skyrmion bags.

<h3>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov tips: imaging spins at the atomic scale with full  magnetic sensitivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09534</a>
<br>
<i>Felix Küster, Souvik Das, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Paolo Sessi</i>
<br>
<br>
Measurements of magnetic properties at the atomic scale require probes
capable of combining high spatial resolution with spin sensitivity.
Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) fulfills these conditions
by using atomically sharp magnetic tips. The imaging of spin structures results
from the tunneling magneto-conductance that depends on the imbalance in the
local density of spin-up and spin-down electrons. Spin-sensitive tips are
generally formed from bulk materials or by coating non-magnetic tips with a
thin magnetic layer. However, ferromagnetic materials generate stray magnetic
fields which can influence the magnetic structure of the probed system, while
the magnetization of antiferromagnetic materials is difficult to set tip by
externally applied magnetic fields. Here, we use functionalized
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) tips prepared by attaching magnetic adatoms at the apex
of a superconducting cluster to image magnetic interactions at the atomic
scale. We demonstrate that YSR tips are capable of sensing different
magnetization directions, conferring them full magnetic sensitivity. We
additionally show that the finite size of the tip superconducting cluster makes
it robust against relatively strong magnetic fields, making YSR tips capable of
visualizing magnetic field driven transitions of the spin texture.

<h3>Tilted Spirals and Low Temperature Skyrmions in Cu2OSeO3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09539</a>
<br>
<i>M. Crisanti, A. O. Leonov, R. Cubitt, A. Labh, H. Wilhelm, Marcus P. Schmidt, C. Pappas</i>
<br>
<br>
The bulk helimagnet Cu2OSeO3 represents a unique example in the family of B20
cubic helimagnets exhibiting a tilted spiral and skyrmion phase at low
temperatures when the magnetic field is applied along the easy <001>
crystallographic direction. Here we present a systematic study of the stability
and ordering of these low temperature magnetic states. We focus our attention
on the temperature and field dependencies of the tilted spiral state that we
observe persisting up to above T =35 K, i.e. up to higher temperatures than
reported so far. We discuss these results in the frame of the phenomenological
theory introduced by Dzyaloshinskii in an attempt to reach a quantitative
description of the experimental findings. We find that the anisotropy
constants, which are the drivers behind the observed behaviour, exhibit a
pronounced temperature dependence. This explains the differences in the
behaviour observed at high temperatures (above T = 18 K), where the cubic
anisotropy is weak, and at low temperatures (below T = 18 K), where a strong
cubic anisotropy induces an abrupt appearance of the tilted spirals out of the
conical state and enhances the stability of skyrmions.

<h3>Large and tunable spin-orbit effect of 6p orbitals through structural  cavities in crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09545</a>
<br>
<i>Mauro Fava, William Lafargue-Dit-Hauret, Aldo H. Romero, Eric Bousquet</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore from first-principles calculations the ferroelectric material
Pb5Ge3O11 as a model for controlling the spin-orbit interaction (SOC) in
crystalline solids. The SOC has a surprisingly strong effect on the structural
energy landscape by deepening the ferroelectric double well. We observe that
this effect comes from a specific Pb Wyckoff site that lies on the verge of a
natural cavity channel of the crystal. We also find that a unique cavity state
is formed by the empty 6p states of another Pb site at the edge of the cavity
channel. This cavity state exhibits a sizeable spin splitting with a mixed
Rashba-Weyl character and a topologically protected crossing of the related
bands. We also show that the ferroelectric properties and the significant SOC
effects are exceptionally robust against n-doping up to several electrons per
unit cell. We trace the provenance of these original effects to the unique
combination of the structural cavity channel and the chemistry of the Pb atoms
with 6p orbitals localizing inside the channel.

<h3>The Memory Function of the Generalized Diffusion Equation of Active  Motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09567</a>

<br>
<br>
An exact description of the statistical motion of active particles in three
dimension is presented in the framework of a generalized diffusion equation.
Such a generalization contemplates a non-local, in time and space, connecting
(memory) function. This couples the rate of change of the probability density
of finding the particle at position $\boldsymbol{x}$ at time $t$, with the
Laplacian of the probability density at all previous times and to all points in
space. Starting from the standard Fokker-Planck-like equation for the
probability density of finding an active particle at position $\boldsymbol{x}$
swimming along the direction $\hat{\boldsymbol{v}}$ at time $t$, we derive in
this paper, in an exact manner, the connecting function that allows a
description of active motion in terms of this generalized diffusion equation.

<h3>Moir{é} pattern assisted geometric resonant tunneling in disordered  twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09587" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09587</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the mesoscopic transport through a twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) consisting of a clean graphene nanoribbon on the bottom and a disordered
graphene disc on the top. We show that, with strong top-layer disorder the
transmission through such a device shows a sequence of resonant peaks with
respect to the rotation angle $\theta$, where at the resonance angles
$\theta_c$ the disc region contains one giant hexagonal moir{\'e} supercell. A
further investigation shows that the value of $\theta_c$ shows negligible
dependence on the disorder strength, the Fermi energy, and the shape
distortion, indicating the resonance is a robust geometric feature of the
moir{\'e} supercell. We explain this geometric resonance based on the bound
states formed inside the moir{\'e} supercell, with their averaged local density
of states dominating at the AA stacking region while minimizing at the AB
stacking region. By increasing the interlayer distance, the peak becomes less
pronounced which further confirms the role of interlayer coupling. The results
presented here suggest a new mechanism to tune the quantum transport signal
through the twist angle in disordered moir{\'e} systems.

Spinel oxides demonstrate significant technological promise due to the vast
array of interrelated physical properties that their unique structure supports.
Specifically, the Fe1+xV2-xO4 spinel system garners extensive interest due to
the presence of orbitally ordered states and multiferroism. This study focuses
on the elaboration of high-quality Fe2VO4 (x = 1) thin films on MgO substrates
via pulsed laser deposition. Structural analyses confirm the epitaxial growth
of the films, their high crystallinity and fully strained nature. The cationic
distribution and stoichiometry were investigated using Resonant Elastic X-ray
Scattering experiments, in conjunction with comprehensive characterization of
the films' physical and electrical properties. The films exhibit
room-temperature magnetism, with a magnetization consistent with the
(Fe3+)Td[Fe2+V3+2]OhO4 inverse spinel structure unveiled by anomalous
diffraction. This work represents the inaugural successful deposition of Fe2VO4
thin films, thereby expanding the family of spinel vanadium oxide thin films
with a new member that demonstrates room-temperature magnetic properties.

<h3>Revealing the Predictive Power of Neural Operators for Strain Evolution  in Digital Composites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09623</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The demand for high-performance materials, along with advanced synthesis
technologies such as additive manufacturing and 3D printing, has spurred the
development of hierarchical composites with superior properties. However,
computational modelling of such composites using physics-based solvers, while
enabling the discovery of optimal microstructures, have prohibitively high
computational cost hindering their practical application. To this extent, we
show that Neural Operators (NOs) can be used to learn and predict the strain
evolution in 2D digital composites. Specifically, we consider three
architectures, namely, Fourier NO (FNO), Wavelet NO (WNO), and Multi-wavelet NO
(MWT). We demonstrate that by providing a few initial strain frames as input,
NOs can accurately predict multiple future time steps in an extremely
data-efficient fashion, especially WNO. Further, once trained, NOs forecast the
strain trajectories for completely unseen boundary conditions. Among NOs, only
FNO offers super-resolution capabilities for estimating strains at multiple
length scales, which can provide higher material and pixel-wise resolution. We
also show that NOs can generalize to arbitrary geometries with finer domain
resolution without the need for additional training. Based on all the results
presented, we note that the FNO exhibits the best performance among the NOs,
while also giving minimum inference time that is almost three orders magnitude
lower than the conventional finite element solutions. Thus, FNOs can be used as
a surrogate for accelerated simulation of the strain evolution in complex
microstructures toward designing the next composite materials.

<h3>AI-enabled Lorentz microscopy for quantitative imaging of nanoscale  magnetic spin textures</h3>

<br>
<br>
The manipulation and control of nanoscale magnetic spin textures is of rising
interest as they are potential foundational units in next-generation computing
paradigms. Achieving this requires a quantitative understanding of the spin
texture behavior under external stimuli using in situ experiments. Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) enables real-space imaging of spin
textures at the nanoscale, but quantitative characterization of in situ data is
extremely challenging. Here, we present an AI-enabled phase-retrieval method
based on integrating a generative deep image prior with an image formation
forward model for LTEM. Our approach uses a single out-of-focus image for phase
retrieval and achieves significantly higher accuracy and robustness to noise
compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our method is capable of isolating
sample heterogeneities from magnetic contrast, as shown by application to
simulated and experimental data. This approach allows quantitative phase
reconstruction of in situ data and can also enable near real-time quantitative
magnetic imaging.

<h3>Partially Saturated Granular Flow in a Rotating Drum: The Role of  Cohesion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09682</a>
<br>
<i>Mingrui Dong, Zhongzheng Wang, Benjy Marks, Yu Chen, Yixiang Gan</i>
<br>
<br>
Partially saturated granular flows are common in various natural and
industrial processes, such as landslides, mineral handling, and food
processing. We conduct experiments and apply the Discrete Element Method (DEM)
to study granular flows in rotating drums under partially saturated conditions.
We focus on varying the strength of cohesion (surface tension) and rotation
rate within the modes of rolling flow and cascading flow. With an increase in
surface tension, a rolling mode can possess a steeper slope and correspondingly
needs a higher rotation rate to transition to a cascading. The depth of the
flowing region increases with increasing cohesion, while the sensitivity is
reduced for cases of high cohesion. We propose a dimensionless number CE that
captures the combined effects of rotation, gravity and cohesion on the dynamic
angle of repose and flow depth. In addition, we extract statistical information
on the formation of clusters within the flow. We find a power law relation
between the cluster size distribution and its probability, which indicates that
stronger cohesion can promote the formation of larger clusters, and we discuss
how cohesion impact on flows manifested by cluster formation.

<h3>Uniform and Staggered electric axial moment in zigzag chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09686</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate electronic orderings with the electric axial
moment without breakings of both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries
in the zigzag-chain system. Especially, we elucidate the role of the local
odd-parity hybridization arising from locally noncentrosymmetric lattice
structures based on symmetry and microscopic model analyses. We show that the
odd-parity crystalline electric field gives rise to an effective cross-product
coupling between the electric dipole and electric toroidal dipole, the latter
of which corresponds to the electric axial moment. As a result, the staggered
component of the electric axial moment is induced by applying an external
electric field, while its uniform component is induced via the appearance of
staggered electric dipole ordering. We also show that uniform electric
quadrupole ordering accompanies uniform electric axial moment. Furthermore, we
discuss transverse magnetization as a consequence of the orderings with the
uniform electric axial moment. Our results extend the scope of materials
exhibiting electric axial ordering to those with locally noncentrosymmetric
lattice structures.

<h3>Fast Fourier-Chebyshev approach to real-space simulations of the Kubo  formula</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09690" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09690</a>
<br>
<i>Santiago Giménez de Castro, João M. Viana Parente Lopes, Aires Ferreira, D. A. Bahamon</i>
<br>
<br>
The Kubo formula is a cornerstone in our understanding of near-equilibrium
transport phenomena. While conceptually elegant, the application of Kubo's
linear-response theory to interesting problems is hindered by the lack of
algorithms that are accurate and scalable to large lattice sizes beyond one
spatial dimension. Here, we propose a general framework to numerically study
large systems, which combines the spectral accuracy of Chebyshev expansions
with the efficiency of divide-and-conquer methods. We use the hybrid algorithm
to calculate the two-terminal conductance and the bulk conductivity tensor of
2D lattice models with over $10^7$ sites. By efficiently sampling the
microscopic information contained in billions of Chebyshev moments, the
algorithm is able to accurately resolve the linear-response properties of
complex systems in the presence of quenched disorder. Our results lay the
groundwork for future studies of transport phenomena in previously inaccessible
regimes.

<h3>A Unified Diode Equation for Organic Photovoltaic Devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09698" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09698</a>
<br>
<i>Oskar J Sandberg, Ardalan Armin</i>
<br>
<br>
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising candidates for future sustainable
technologies, including applications within the renewable energy sector, such
as solar cells and indoor light recycling, and photodetection. However, the
performance of OPVs is still inferior compared to established technologies,
partially due to the intrinsically low charge carrier mobilities and large
recombination losses in the low-permittivity, molecular organic semiconductors.
To better understand these losses, accurate analytical diode models capable of
capturing the underlying device physics are imperative. However, previously
proposed analytical models have neglected the effects of injected charge
carriers, which is the predominant source for bimolecular recombination in
thin-film systems with ohmic contacts. In this work, we derive a unified diode
equation for current in OPVs, which accounts for the interplay between charge
carrier extraction, injection, and bimolecular recombination. To this end, we
use a regional approximation approach to solve the coupled charge transport
equations in sandwich-type thin film devices. The diode model is further
validated by numerical simulations and experimental data. The derived
theoretical framework not only provides vital insights into the underlying
device physics of OPVs but is generally applicable to sandwich-type thin-film
photovoltaic device based on semiconductors with low charge carrier mobilities.

<h3>Theory of anomalous Hall effect in transition-metal pentatelluride  $\mathrm{ZrTe}_{5}$ and $\mathrm{HfTe}_{5}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09708</a>
<br>
<i>Huan-Wen Wang, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen</i>
<br>
<br>
The anomalous Hall effect has considerable impact on the progress of
condensed matter physics and occurs in systems with time-reversal symmetry
breaking. Here we theoretically investigate the anomalous Hall effect in
nonmagnetic transition-metal pentatelluride $\mathrm{ZrTe_{5}}$ and
$\mathrm{HfTe}_{5}$. In the presence of Zeeman splitting and Dirac mass, there
is an intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity induced by the Berry curvature in
the semiclassical treatment. In a finite magnetic field, the anomalous Hall
conductivity rapidly decays to zero for constant spin-splitting and vanishes
for the magnetic-field-dependent Zeeman energy. A semiclassical formula is
derived to depict the magnetic field dependence of the Hall conductivity, which
is beneficial for experimental data analysis. Lastly, when the chemical
potential is fixed in the magnetic field, a Hall conductivity plateau arises,
which may account for the observed anomalous Hall effect in experiments.

<h3>Transverse-field $XY$ spin chain with the competing long-range  interactions: Multi-criticality around the $XX$-symmetric point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09734" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09734</a>
<br>
<i>Yoshihiro Nishiyama</i>
<br>
<br>
The transverse-field $XY$ spin chain with competing antiferromagnetic
long-range interactions, $J_r \propto 1/r^\alpha$ ($r$: distance between
spins), and the exponent $\alpha$ was investigated numerically. The main
concern is to clarify the character of the transverse-field-driven phase
transition for the small-$\alpha$ regime around the $XX$-symmetric point,
$\eta=0$ ($\eta$: $XY$-anisotropy parameter). To cope with the negative-sign
problem, we employed the exact-diagonalization method, which enables us to
evaluate the fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F$. Because the fidelity
susceptibility does not assume any order parameter after a phase transition, it
detects the multi-criticality around the $XX$-symmetric point in a systematic
manner. As a preliminary survey, with $\eta=0.5$ and $\alpha=2$ fixed, we made
the scaling analysis of $\chi_F$. The scaling behavior of $\chi_F$ shows that
the transverse-field-driven phase transition belongs to the 2D-Ising
universality class. Thereby, with the properly crossover-scaled $\eta$, the
$\chi_F$ data is cast into the crossover scaling formula for the small-$\alpha$
regime. The multi-critical exponents fed into the scaling formula are argued
through referring to related studies.

<h3>Emergence of two-fold spectral topology through non-Abelian gauge  engineering</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-Abelian phenomena and non-Hermitian systems have both been widely
explored in recent years. As a bridge between the two, we introduce and develop
non-Abelian gauge engineering for realizing multi-fold spectral topology. As an
example of our proposal, we engineer non-Hermiticity in the paradigmatic
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model by introducing a generalized non-Abelian
gauge, leading to an emergent two-fold spectral topology that governs the
decoupled behaviour of the corresponding non-Hermitian skin effect. As a
consequence of the non-Abelian gauge choice, our model exhibits a rich phase
diagram consisting of distinct topological phases, which we characterize by
introducing the notion of paired winding numbers, which, in turn, predict the
direction of skin localization under open boundaries. We demonstrate that the
choice of gauge parameters enables control over the directionality of the skin
effect, allowing for it to be unilateral or bilateral. Furthermore, we discover
non-dispersive flat bands emerging within the inherent SSH model framework,
arising from the non-Abelian gauge. We also introduce a simplified toy model to
capture the underlying physics, thereby giving direct physical insights. Our
findings pave way for the exploration of unconventional spectral topology
through non-Abelian gauges.

<h3>Coupling of the triple-Q state to the atomic lattice by anisotropic  symmetric exchange</h3>

<br>
We identify the triple-Q (3Q) state as magnetic ground state in Pd/Mn and
Rh/Mn bilayers on Re(0001) using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
and density functional theory. An atomistic model reveals that in general the
3Q state with tetrahedral magnetic order and zero net spin moment is coupled to
a hexagonal atomic lattice in a highly symmetric orientation via the
anisotropic symmetric exchange interaction, whereas other spin-orbit coupling
terms cancel due to symmetry. Our experiments are in agreement with the
predicted orientation of the 3Q state. A distortion from the ideal tetrahedral
angles leads to other orientations of the 3Q state which, however, results in a
reduced topological orbital magnetization compared to the ideal 3Q state.

<br>
<br>
We study the dynamics of two capacitively coupled quantum dots, each coupled
to a lead. A Floquet Green's function approach described the system's dynamics,
with the electron-electron interactions handled with the fluctuation-exchange
approximation. While electrons cannot move between the separate sections of the
device, energy transfer occurs with the periodic driving of one of the leads.
This process was found to be explained with four stages. The energy transfer
was also found to be sensitive to the driving frequency of the leads, with an
optimal frequency corresponding to the optimal completion of the four stages of
the identified process.

<h3>Superconductivity with Wannier-Stark Flat Bands</h3>

<br>
<i>Si Min Chan, Alexei Andreanov, Sergej Flach, G. George Batrouni</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate superconducting transport in the DC field induced
Wannier-Stark flat bands in the presence of interactions. Flat bands offer the
possibility of unconventional high temperature superconductivity, where the
superfluid weight, $D_s$, is enhanced by the density overlap of the localized
states. However, construction of flat bands typically requires very precise
tuning of Hamiltonian parameters. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a
feasible alternative to realize flat bands by applying a DC field in a
commensurate lattice direction. We systematically characterize the
superconducting behavior on these flat bands by studying the effect of the DC
field and attractive Hubbard interaction strengths on the wavefunction,
correlation length, pairing order parameter and the superfluid weight $D_s$.
Our main result is that the superfluid weight is dramatically enhanced at an
optimal value of the interaction strength and weak DC fields.

We report a comprehensive study of magneto-transport properties in MoSi2 bulk
and thin films. Textured MoSi2 thin films of around 70 nm were deposited on
silicon substrates with different orientations. Giant magnetoresistance of
1000% was observed in sintered bulk samples while MoSi2 single crystals exhibit
a magnetoresistance (MR) value of 800% at low temperatures. At the low
temperatures, the MR of the textured thin films show weak anti-localization
behaviour owing to the spin orbit coupling effects. Our first principle
calculation show the presence of surface states in this material. The
resistivity of all the MoSi2 thin films is significantly low and nearly
independent of the temperature, which is important for electronic devices.

Spin-wave based transmission and processing of information is a promising
emerging nano-technology that can help overcome limitations of traditional
electronics based on the transfer of electrical charge. Among the most
important challenges for this technology is the implementation of spin-wave
devices that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field.
Here we experimentally demonstrate that this can be achieved using
sub-micrometer wide spin-wave waveguides fabricated from ultrathin films of
low-loss magnetic insulator - Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG). We show that these
waveguides exhibit a highly stable single-domain static magnetic configuration
at zero field and support long-range propagation of spin waves with gigahertz
frequencies. The experimental results are supported by micromagnetic
simulations, which additionally provide information for optimization of
zero-field guiding structures. Our findings create the basis for the
development of energy-efficient zero-field spin-wave devices and circuits.

We report the observation of anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Sn polycrystalline
thin films deposited on Pt coated Al2O3 substrate with a large anomalous Hall
conductivity of 65({\Omega}cm)-1 at 3K. The Hall and magnetic measurements show
a very small hysteresis owing to a weak ferromagnetic moment in this material.
The longitudinal resistivity decreases sufficiently for the thin films as
compared to the polycrystalline bulk sample used as the target for the film
deposition. The anomalous Hall resistivity and conductivity decreases almost
linearly with the increase in the temperature. A negative magnetoresistance is
observed for all the measured temperatures with the negative decrease in the
magnitude with the increase in temperature.

<br>
<br>
The utilization of orbital transport provides a versatile and efficient spin
manipulation mechanism. As interest in orbital-mediated spin manipulation
grows, we face a new issue to identify the underlying physics that determines
the efficiency of orbital torque (OT). In this study, we systematically
investigate the variation of OT governed by orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect at
the Cu/Oxide interface, as we change the Oxide material. We find that OT varies
by a factor of ~2, depending on the Oxide. Our results suggest that the active
electronic interatomic interaction (hopping) between Cu and oxygen atom is
critical in determining OT. This also gives us an idea of what type of material
factors is critical in forming a chiral orbital Rashba texture at the Cu/Oxide
interface.

<h3>Phantom-Chain Simulations for the Effect of Node Functionality on the  Fracture of Star-Polymer Networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
The influence of node functionality (f) on the fracture of polymer networks
remains unclear. While many studies have focused on multi-functional nodes with
f>4, recent research suggests that networks with f=3 exhibit superior fracture
properties compared to those with f=4. To clarify this discrepancy, we
conducted phantom chain simulations for star-polymer networks varying f between
3 and 8. Our simulations utilized equimolar binary mixtures of star branch
prepolymers with a uniform arm length. We employed a Brownian dynamics scheme
to equilibrate sols and induce gelation through end-linking reactions. We
prevented the formation of odd-order loops owing to the binary reaction and
second-order loops algorithmically. We stored network structures at various
conversion ratios ({\phi}_c) and minimized energy to reduce computation costs
induced by structural relaxation. We subjected the networks to stretching until
fracture to determine stress and strain at break and work for fracture,
{\epsilon}_b, {\sigma}_b, and W_b. These fracture characteristics are highly
dependent on {\phi}_c for networks with small f but relatively insensitive for
those with large f. Thus, the networks with small f exhibit greater fracture
properties than those with large f at high {\phi}_c, whereas the opposite
relationship occurs at low {\phi}_c. We analyzed {\epsilon}_b, {\sigma}_b, and
W_b concerning the cycle rank {\xi} and the broken strand fraction {\phi}_bb.
We found {\epsilon}_b, {\sigma}_b/{\phi}_bb, and W_b/{\phi}_bb monotonically
decrease with increasing {\xi}, and the data for various f and {\phi}_c
superpose with each other to draw master curves. These results imply that the
mechanical superiority of the networks with small f comes from their smaller
{\xi} that gives higher {\epsilon}_b, {\sigma}_b/{\phi}_bb, and W_b/{\phi}_bb
than the networks with large f.

<h3>Spin-valley dependent double Andreev reflections in the proximitized  graphene/superconductor junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09833" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09833</a>
<br>
<i>Lu Gao, Qiang Cheng, Qing-Feng Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the Andreev reflections and the quantum transport in the
proximitized graphene/superconductor junction. The proximitized graphene
possesses the pseudospin staggered potential and the intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling induced by substrate, which are responsible for the spin-valley
dependent double Andreev reflections and the anomalous transport properties in
the junction. The pure specular Andreev reflection can happen in the
superconducting gap for the $K\uparrow$ and $K'\downarrow$ electrons while the
pure retro-Andreev reflection happens for the $K\downarrow$ and $K'\uparrow$
electrons. The coexisting two types of Andreev reflections related to the fixed
spin-valley indices strongly depend on the chemical potential of the
proximitized graphene. The condition of the emergence of the specific type of
Andreev reflection for the electrons with the fixed spin-valley index is
clarified. The spin-valley dependent Andreev reflections bring about the
peculiar conductance spectra of the junction, which can help determine the
values of the pseudospin staggered potential and the intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling induced in graphene. Hence, our research results not only provide an
experimental method to detect the induced potential and coupling in graphene
but also establish the foundation of the superconductor electronics based on
the spin-valley indices.

<br>
<i>L. Andriambariarijaona, F. Datchi H. Zhang, K. Béneut, B. Baptiste, N. Guignot, S. Ninet</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of the phase diagram of
ammonia hemihydrate (AHH) in the range of 2-30 GPa and 300-700 K, based on
Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction experiments and visual observations.
Four solid phases, denoted AHH-II, DIMA, pbcc and qbcc, are present in this
domain, one of which, AHH-qbcc was discovered in this work. We show that,
unlike previously thought, the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase obtained on
heating AHH-II below 10 GPa, denoted here as AHH-pbcc, is distinct from the
DIMA phase, although both present the same bcc structure and O/N positional
disorder. Our results actually indicates that AHH-pbcc is a plastic form of
DIMA, characterized by free molecular rotations. AHH-qbcc is observed in the
intermediate P-T range between AHH-II and DIMA. It presents a complex x-ray
pattern reminiscent of the "quasi-bcc" structures that have been theoretically
predicted, although none of these structures is consistent with our data. The
transition lines between all solid phases as well as the melting curve have
been mapped in detail, showing that: (1) the new qbcc phase is the stable one
in the intermediate P-T range 10-19 GPa, 300-450 K, although the II-qbcc
transition is kinetically hindered for T < 450 K, and II directly transits to
DIMA in a gradual fashion from 25 to 35 GPa at 300 K. (2) The stability domain
of qbcc shrinks above 450 K and eventually terminates at a pbcc-qbcc-DIMA
triple point at 21.5 GPa-630 K. (3) A direct and reversible transition occurs
between AHH-pbcc and DIMA above 630 K. (4) The pbcc solid stability domain
extends up to the melting line above 3 GPa, and a II-pbcc-liquid triple point
is identified at 3 GPa-320 K.

<h3>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem for 1d quantum magnets with antiunitary  translation and inversion symmetries</h3>

<i>Yuan Yao, Linhao Li, Masaki Oshikawa, Chang-Tse Hsieh</i>
<br>
<br>
We study quantum many-body systems in the presence of an exotic antiunitary
translation or inversion symmetry involving time reversal. Based on a
symmetry-twisting method and spectrum robustness,we propose that a half-integer
spin chain which respects any of these two antiunitary crystalline symmetries
in addition to the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ global
spin-rotation symmetry must either be gapless or possess degenerate ground
states. This explains the gaplessness of a class of chiral spin models not
indicated by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its known extensions.
Moreover, we present symmetry classes with minimal sets of generators that give
nontrivial LSM-type constraints, argued by the bulk-boundary correspondence in
2d symmetry-protected topological phases as well as lattice homotopy. Our
results for detecting the ingappability of 1d quantum magnets from the
interplay between spin-rotation symmetries and magnetic space groups are
applicable to systems with a broader class of spin interactions, including the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and triple-product interactions.

<br>
<br>
The recent report of pressure-induced structure transition and signature of
superconductivity with Tc = 80 K above 14 GPa in the La3Ni2O7 crystals has
garnered considerable attention. To further elaborate this discovery, we
carried out comprehensive resistance measurements on the La3Ni2O7 crystals
grown with the optical-image floating zone furnace under oxygen pressure (15
bar) by using the diamond anvil cell (DAC) and cubic anvil cell (CAC), which
employs the solid and liquid pressure transmitting medium, respectively. For
the sample #1 measured in DAC, it exhibits a semiconducting-like behavior with
large resistance at low pressures and becomes metallic gradually upon
compression. At the pressures P >= 13.7 GPa, we observed the appearance of
resistance drop as large as ~50% around 70 K, which evolves into a kink-like
anomaly at pressures above 40 GPa and shifts to lower temperatures gradually
with increasing magnetic field. These observations are consistent with the
recent report mentioned above. On the other hand, the sample #2 measured in CAC
retains the metallic behavior in the investigated pressure range up to 15 GPa.
The hump-like anomaly in resistance around ~130 K at ambient pressure
disappears at P >= 2 GPa. In the pressure range from 11 to 15 GPa, we observed
the gradual development of a shoulder-like anomaly in resistance at low
temperatures, which evolves into a pronounced drop of resistance by 98% below
62 K at 15 GPa, reaching a temperature-independent resistance of 20 uOhm below
20 K. Similarly, this resistance anomaly can be shifted to lower temperatures
progressively by applying external magnetic fields, resembling a typical
superconducting transition.

We extend the notion of topologically protected semi-metallic band crossings
to hyperbolic lattices in negatively curved space. Due to their distinct
translation group structure, such lattices support non-Abelian Bloch states
which, unlike conventional Bloch states, acquire a matrix-valued Bloch factor
under lattice translations. Combining diverse numerical and analytical
approaches, we uncover a quartic scaling in the density of states at low
energies, and illuminate a nodal manifold of codimension five in the reciprocal
space. The nodal manifold is topologically protected by a non-zero second Chern
number, reminiscent of the characterization of Weyl nodes by the first Chern
number.

<br>

Two theorems on electron states in helimagnets are proved. They reveal a
Kramers-like degeneracy in helical magnetic field. Since a commensurate helical
magnetic system is transitionally invariant with two multiple periods (ordinary
translations and generalized ones with rotations), the band structure turns out
to be topologically nontrivial. Together with the degeneracy, this gives an
unusual spin structure of electron bands. A 2D model of nearly free electrons
is proposed to describe conductive hexagonal palladium layers under an
effective field of magnetically ordered CrO$_2$ spacers in PdCrO$_2$. The spin
texture of the Fermi surface leads to abnormal conductivity.

<br>

We propose how to create, control, and read-out real-space localized spin
qubits in proximitized finite graphene nanoribbon (GNR) systems using purely
electrical methods. Our proposed nano-qubits are formed of in-gap
singlet-triplet states that emerge through the interplay of Coulomb and
relativistic spin-dependent interactions in GNRs placed on a magnetic
substrate. Application of an electric field perpendicular to the GNR
heterostructure leads to a sudden change in the proximity couplings, i.e. a
quantum quench, which enables us to deterministically rotate the nano-qubit to
any arbitrary point on the Bloch sphere. We predict these spin qubits to
undergo Rabi oscillations with optimal visibility and frequencies in excess of
10 GHz. Our findings open up a new avenue for the realization of graphene-based
quantum computing with ultra-fast all-electrical methods.

<h3>Tracer dynamics in active random average process</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09908</a>
<br>
<i>Saikat Santra, Prashant Singh, Anupam Kundu</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the dynamics of tracer particles in the random average process
(RAP), a single-file system in one dimension. In addition to the position,
every particle possesses an internal spin variable $\sigma (t)$ that can
alternate between two values, $\pm 1$, at a constant rate $\gamma$. Physically,
the value of $\sigma (t)$ dictates the direction of motion of the corresponding
particle and for finite $\gamma$, every particle performs a non-Markovian
active dynamics. Herein, we study the effect of this non-Markovianity in the
fluctuations and correlations of the positions of tracer particles. We
analytically show that the variance of the position of a tagged particle grows
sub-diffusively as $\sim \zeta_{\text{q}} \sqrt{t}$ at large times for the
quenched uniform initial condition. While this sub-diffusive growth is
identical to that of the Markovian/non-persistent RAP, the coefficient
$\zeta_{\text{q}} $ is rather different and bears the signature of the
persistent motion of active particles through higher point correlations (unlike
in the Markovian case). Similarly, for the annealed (steady state) initial
condition, we find that the variance scales as $\sim \zeta_{\text{a}} \sqrt{t}$
at large times with coefficient $\zeta_{\text{a}} $ once again different from
the non-persistent case. Although $\zeta_{\text{q}}$ and $\zeta_{\text{a}} $
both individually depart from their Markov counterparts, their ratio
$\zeta_{\text{a}} / \zeta_{\text{q}}$ is still equal to $\sqrt{2}$, a condition
observed for other diffusive single-file systems. This condition turns out to
be true even in the strongly active regimes as corroborated by extensive
simulations and calculations. Finally, we study the correlation between the
positions of two tagged particles in both quenched uniform and annealed initial
conditions. We verify all our analytic results by extensive numerical
simulations.

Phenalenyl is a radical nanographene with triangular shape that hosts an
unpaired electron with spin S = 1/2. The open-shell nature of phenalenyl is
expected to be retained in covalently bonded networks. Here, we study a first
step in that direction and report the synthesis of the phenalenyl dimer by
combining in-solution synthesis and on-surface activation and its
characterization both on Au(111) and on a monolayer of NaCl on top of Au(111)
by means of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). IETS shows
inelastic steps that, together with a thorough theoretical analysis, are
identified as the singlet-triplet excitation arising from interphenalenyl
exchange. Two prominent features of our data permit to shed light on the nature
of spin interactions in this system. First, the excitation energies with and
without the NaCl decoupling layer are 48 and 41 meV, respectively, indicating a
significant renormalization of the spin excitation energies due to exchange
with the Au(111) electrons. Second, a position-dependent bias-asymmetry of the
height of the inelastic steps is accounted for by an interphenalenyl
hybridization of the singly occupied phenalenyl orbitals that is only possible
via third neighbor hopping. This hybridization is also essential to activate
kinetic interphenalenyl exchange. Our results set the stage for future work on
the bottom-up synthesis of spin S = 1/2 spin lattices with large exchange
interaction.

<br>
We investigate the dynamical onset of superconductivity in the exactly
solvable Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. It hosts an unconventional
superconducting phase that emerges out of a non-Fermi liquid normal state,
providing a toy model for superconductivity in a strongly correlated system.
Analyzing dynamical protocols motivated by theoretical mechanisms proposed for
light-induced superconductivity, that is light-induced cooling and the dressing
of Hamiltonian parameters, we investigate the exact relaxation resulting out of
undercooling and interaction quenches. While, in contrast to BCS theory, it is
not possible for superconductivity to emerge following interaction quenches
across the superconducting phase transition, we find that the dynamical
relaxation of undercooled states universally leads to superconductivity.
Despite the strong correlations, the emerging order parameter dynamics are well
captured by a coarse grained Ginzburg-Landau theory for which we determine all
parameters from microscopics.

Two-dimensional flat-band systems have recently attracted considerable
interest due to the rich physics unveiled by emergent phenomena and correlated
electronic states at van Hove singularities. However, the difficulties in
electrically detecting the flat band position in field-effect structures are
slowing down the investigation of their properties. In this work, we employ
Indium Selenide (InSe) as a flat-band system due to a van Hove singularity at
the valence band edge in a few-layer form of the material without the
requirement of a twist angle. We investigate tunneling photocurrents in gated
few-layer InSe structures and relate them to ambipolar transport and
photoluminescence measurements. We observe an appearance of a sharp change in
tunneling mechanisms due to the presence of the van Hove singularity at the
flat band. We further corroborate our findings by studying tunneling currents
as a reliable probe for the flat-band position up to room temperature. Our
results create an alternative approach to studying flat-band systems in
heterostructures of 2D materials.

<h3>Nonequilibrium phase transitions in Brownian $p$-state clock model</h3>

<i>Chul-Ung Woo, Jae Dong Noh</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a Brownian $p$-state clock model in two dimensions and
investigate the nature of phase transitions numerically. As a nonequilibrium
extension of the equilibrium lattice model, the Brownian $p$-state clock model
allows spins to diffuse randomly in the two-dimensional space of area $L^2$
under periodic boundary conditions. We find three distinct phases for $p>4$: a
disordered paramagnetic phase, a quasi-long-range-ordered critical phase, and
an ordered ferromagnetic phase. In the intermediate critical phase, the
magnetization order parameter follows a power law scaling $m \sim
L^{-\tilde{\beta}}$, where the finite-size scaling exponent $\tilde{\beta}$
varies continuously. These critical behaviors are reminiscent of the double
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless~(BKT) transition picture of the equilibrium
system. At the transition to the disordered phase, the exponent takes the
universal value $\tilde\beta = 1/8$ which coincides with that of the
equilibrium system. This result indicates that the BKT transition driven by the
unbinding of topological excitations is robust against the particle diffusion.
On the contrary, the exponent at the symmetry-breaking transition to the
ordered phase deviates from the universal value $\tilde{\beta} = 2/p^2$ of the
equilibrium system. The deviation is attributed to a nonequilibrium effect from
the particle diffusion.

A series of MD and DFT simulations were performed to investigate hydrogen
self-clustering and retention in tungsten. Using a newly develop machine
learned interatomic potential, spontaneous formation of hydrogen platelets was
observed after implanting low-energy hydrogen into tungsten at high fluxes and
temperatures. The platelets formed along low miller index orientations and
neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral sites and could grow to over 50 atoms in
size. High temperatures above 600 K and high hydrogen concentrations were
needed to observe significant platelet formation. A critical platelet size of
six hydrogen atoms was needed for long term stability. Platelets smaller than
this were found to be thermally unstable within a few nanoseconds. To verify
these observations, characteristic platelets from the MD simulations were
simulated using large-scale DFT. DFT corroborated the MD results in that large
platelets were also found to be dynamically stable for five or more hydrogen
atoms. The LDOS from the DFT simulated platelets indicated that hydrogen atoms,
particularly at the periphery of the platelet, were found to be at least as
stable as hydrogen atoms in bulk tungsten. In addition, electrons were found to
be localized around hydrogen atoms in the platelet itself and that hydrogen
atoms up to 4.2 Angstrom away within the platelet were found to be bonded
suggesting that the hydrogen atoms are interacting across longer distances than
previously suggested. These results reveal a self-clustering mechanisms for
hydrogen within tungsten in the absence of radiation induced or microstructural
defects that could be a precursor to blistering and potentially explain the
experimentally observed high hydrogen retention particularly in the near
surface region.

The Kondo insulator (KI) is studyed in the frameworrk of one dimensional
models of Kondo and symmentic Anderson lattices at half filling. The consistent
application of the mean field approach and the solution using the Bethe ansatz
made it possible to come close to solving the problem of the ground state of
KI. It is shown, that in ${Z}_2$-field electrons and local moments form
singlets at each lattice site. This field leads to an on-site interaction, on
which electrons are scattered. In the Kondo chain the Kondo insulator is
similar to the Mott insulator in the Hubbard chain. The advantage of proposed
approach is that it is possible to solve the problem for arbitrary exchange
interaction constant. In the Anderson lattice, the indirect on-site interaction
between band electrons is attractive, which makes it possible to propose a new
mechanism for high $T_c$ superconductivity in real compounds.

We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the band structure of a
bilayer graphene with a magic twist angle of 1.08{\deg}. The coupling of
tight-binding model and Peierls phase allows the calculation of the energy
bands of periodic two-dimensional systems. For an orthogonal magnetic field,
the Landau levels turn out to be dispersive, especially for magnetic lengths
comparable or larger than the twisted bilayer cell size. A high in-plane
magnetic field modifies the low-energy bands and gap, which we demonstrate to
be a direct consequence of the minimal coupling.

Silica (SiO$_2$) nanotubes (NTs) are used in a wide range of applications
that go from sensors to nanofluidics. Currently, these NTs can be grown with
diameters as small as 3 nm, with walls 1.5 nm thick. Recent experimental
advances combined with first-principles calculations suggest that silica NTs
could be obtained from a single silica sheet. In this work, we explore the
water adsorption in such ultrathin silica NTs using molecular simulation and
first-principles calculations. Combining molecular dynamics and density
functional theory calculations we obtain putative structures for NTs formed by
10, 12, and 15-membered SiO$_2$ rings. Water adsorption isotherms for these NTs
are obtained using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Computing the
accessible cross-section area ($A_\text{free}$) for the NTs, we were able to
understand how this property correlates with condensation pressures. We found
that $A_\text{free}$ does not necessarily grow with the NT size and that the
higher the confinement (smaller $A_\text{free}$), the larger the condensation
pressure.

<h3>Detecting the interplay between self-statistics and braiding statistics  in 3D topologically ordered phases through topological quantum field theory</h3>

Low-energy effective theory of topological orders is topological quantum
field theory (TQFT). While previous field-theoretical studies in $3$D (real
space dimension) topological orders focus on either self-statistics, braiding
statistics, shrinking rules, or fusion rules, it is yet to systematically put
all topological data together and study their internal consistency. Here, we
construct the topological $BF$ field theory with twisted terms (e.g., $AAdA$
and $AAB$) as well as a $K$-matrix $BB$ term, in order to simultaneously
explore all such topological data and reach anomaly-free topological orders. We
present general formulas and show how the $K$-matrix $BB$ term confines
topological excitations, and how self-statistics of particles is transmuted. In
order to reach anomaly-free topological orders, we explore how the principle of
gauge invariance fundamentally influences the compatibility between braiding
statistics and emergent fermions. For example, suppose the flux (loop
excitation) and the charge (particle excitation) of gauge subgroup
$\mathbb{Z}_{N_{i}}$ are denoted as $\phi_{i}$ and $q_{i}$ respectively in a
$3$D bosonic topological order. The field-theoretical analysis simply tells us,
within the present TQFTs, if $\phi_{i}$ nontrivially participates a multi-loop
braiding or a Borromean-rings braiding, then fermionic $q_{i}$ is prohibited
for ensuring the gauge invariance. Therefore, the possible ways of
self-statistics assignment on particles are highly restricted once other
topological data are given. Our analysis provides a field-theoretical approach
to constructing anomaly-free topological orders in $3$D. Together with the
previous efforts, our work paves the way toward a more complete
field-theoretical analysis of $3$D topological orders, in analogy to the
$K$-matrix Chern-Simons theory of $2$D topological orders.

<h3>Activating the fluorescence of a Ni(II) complex by energy transfer</h3>

<br>
<br>
Luminescence of open-shell 3d metal complexes is often quenched due to
ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) and cooling into a dark metal-centered
excited state. We demonstrate successful activation of fluorescence from
individual nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules in the junction of a scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) by resonant energy transfer from other metal
phthalocyanines at low temperature. By combining STM, scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, STM- induced luminescence, and photoluminescence experiments as
well as time-dependent density functional theory, we provide evidence that
there is an activation barrier for the ISC, which in most experimental
conditions is overcome. We show that this is also the case in an
electroluminescent tunnel junction where individual NiPc molecules adsorbed on
an ultrathin NaCl decoupling film on a Ag(111) substrate are probed. However,
when placing an MPc (M = Zn, Pd, Pt) molecule close to NiPc by means of STM
atomic manipulation, resonant energy transfer can excite NiPc without
overcoming the ISC activation barrier, leading to Q-band fluorescence. This
work demonstrates that the thermally activated population of dark
metal-centered states can be avoided by a designed local environment at low
temperatures paired with a directed molecular excitation into vibrationally
cold electronic states. Thus, we can envisage the use of luminophores based on
more abundant transition metal complexes that do not rely on Pt or Ir.

<br>
<br>
Kagome lattices constitute versatile platforms for studying paradigmatic
correlated phases. While molecular self-assembly of kagome structures on
metallic substrates is promising, it is challenging to realize pristine kagome
properties because of hybridization with the bulk degrees of freedom and
modified electron-electron interactions. We suggest that a superconducting
substrate offers an ideal support for a magnetic kagome lattice. Exchange
coupling induces kagome-derived bands at the interface, which are protected
from the bulk by the superconducting energy gap. We realize a magnetic kagome
lattice on a superconductor by depositing Fe-porphin-chloride molecules on
Pb(111) and using temperature-activated de-chlorination and self-assembly. This
allows us to control the formation of smaller kagome precursors and long-range
ordered kagome islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at
1.6 K, we identify Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states inside the superconducting energy
gap and track their hybridization from the precursors to larger islands, where
the kagome lattice induces extended YSR bands. These YSR-derived kagome bands
are protected inside the superconducting energy gap, motivating further studies
to resolve possible spin-liquid or Kondo-lattice-type behavior.

<br>
<br>
The pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a long-standing fundamental question
in the physics of superconducting materials with strong electronic
correlations. We use the functional renormalization group to investigate the
behavior of superconductivity under uniaxial strain in a two-dimensional
realistic model of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ obtained with density functional theory and
incorporating the effect of spin-orbit coupling. We find a dominant
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductor mostly hosted by the $d_{xy}$-orbital, with no
other closely competing superconducting state. Within this framework we
reproduce the experimentally observed enhancement of the critical temperature
under strain and propose a simple mechanism driven by the density of states to
explain our findings. We also investigate the competition between
superconductivity and spin-density wave ordering as a function of interaction
strength. By comparing theory and experiment, we discuss constraints on a
possible degenerate partner of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting state.

<h3>Linear-in-momentum spin orbit interactions in planar Ge/GeSi  heterostructures and spin qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10007" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10007</a>
<br>
<i>Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, José Carlos Abadillo-Uriel, Gaëtan Veste, Biel Martinez, Jing Li, Benoît Sklénard, Yann-Michel Niquet</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the existence of linear-in-momentum spin-orbit interactions in
the valence band of Ge/GeSi heterostructures using an atomistic tight-binding
method. We show that symmetry breaking at the Ge/GeSi interfaces gives rise to
a linear Dresselhaus-type interaction for heavy-holes. This interaction results
from the heavy-hole/light-hole mixings induced by the interfaces and can be
captured by a suitable correction to the minimal Luttinger-Kohn, four bands
$\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ Hamiltonian. It is dependent on the steepness of the
Ge/GeSi interfaces, and is suppressed if interdiffusion is strong enough.
Besides the Dresselhaus interaction, the Ge/GeSi interfaces also make a
contribution to the in-plane gyromagnetic $g$-factors of the holes. The
tight-binding calculations also highlight the existence of a small linear
Rashba interaction resulting from the couplings between the
heavy-hole/light-hole manifold and the conduction band enabled by the low
structural symmetry of Ge/GeSi heterostructures. These interactions can be
leveraged to drive the hole spin. The linear Dresselhaus interaction may, in
particular, dominate the physics of the devices for out-of-plane magnetic
fields. When the magnetic field lies in-plane, it is, however, usually far less
efficient than the $g$-tensor modulation mechanisms arising from the motion of
the dot in non-separable, inhomogeneous electric fields and strains.

We study the effect of quantum geometry on the many-body ground state of
one-dimensional interacting bosonic systems. We find that the Drude weight is
given by the sum of the kinetic energy and a term proportional to the many-body
quantum metric of the ground state. Notably, the many-body quantum metric
determines the upper bound of the Drude weight. We validate our results on the
Creutz ladder, a flat band model, using exact diagonalization at half and unit
densities. Our work sheds light on the importance of the many-body quantum
geometry in one-dimensional interacting bosonic systems.

Fractional charges are one of the wonders of the fractional quantum Hall
effect, a liquid of strongly correlated electrons in a large magnetic field.
Fractional excitations are also anticipated in two-dimensional crystals of
non-interacting electrons under time-reversal symmetry, as bound states of a
rotating bond order known as Kekul\'e vortex. However, the physical mechanisms
inducing such topological defects remain elusive, preventing experimental
realisations. Here, we report the observation of Kekul\'e vortices in the local
density of states of graphene under time-reversal symmetry. The vortices result
from intervalley scattering on chemisorbed hydrogen adatoms and have a purely
electronic origin. Their 2{\pi} winding is reminiscent of the Berry phase {\pi}
of the massless Dirac electrons. Remarkably, we observe that point scatterers
with different symmetries such as divacancies can also induce a Kekul\'e bond
order without vortex. Therefore, our local-probe study further confirms point
defects as versatile building blocks for the control of graphene's electronic
structure by kekul\'e order.

Quantum simulators offer powerful means to investigate strongly correlated
quantum matter. However, interpreting measurement outcomes in such systems
poses significant challenges. Here, we present a theoretical framework for
information extraction in synthetic quantum matter, illustrated for the case of
a quantum quench in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Employing
non-parametric unsupervised learning tools that provide different measures of
information content, we demonstrate a system-agnostic approach to identify
dominant degrees of freedom. This enables us to rank operators according to
their relevance, akin to effective field theory. To characterize the
corresponding effective description, we then explore the intrinsic dimension of
data sets as a measure of the complexity of the dynamics. This reveals a
simplification of the data structure, which correlates with the emergence of
time-dependent universal behavior in the studied system. Our assumption-free
approach can be immediately applied in a variety of experimental platforms.

We study by numerical simulation the magnetic order in ensembles of randomly
packed magnetic spherical particles which, induced by their uniaxial anisotropy
in the strong coupling limit, behave as Ising dipoles. We explore the role of
the frozen disorder in the positions of the particles assuming a common fixed
direction for the easy axes of all spheres. We look at two types of spatially
disordered configurations. In the first one we consider isotropic positional
distributions which can be obtained from the liquid state of the hard sphere
fluid. We derive the phase diagram in the $T$-$\Phi$ plane where $T$ is the
temperature and $\Phi$ the volume fraction. This diagram exhibits long-range
ferromagnetic order at low $T$ for volume fractions above the threshold
$\Phi_{c} = 0.157$ predicted by mean-field calculations. For $\Phi \lesssim
\Phi_{c}$ a spin-glass phase forms with the same marginal behavior found for
other strongly disordered dipolar systems. The second type of spatial
configurations we study are anisotropic distributions that can be obtained by
freezing a dipolar hard sphere liquid in its polarized state at low
temperature. This structural anisotropy enhances the ferromagnetic order
present in isotropic hard sphere configurations.

From bacteria and sperm cells to artificial microrobots, self-propelled
microscopic objects at low Reynolds number frequently perceive fluctuating
mechanical and chemical stimuli, and contact exterior wall boundaries both in
nature and in the laboratory. In this study, we theoretically investigate the
fundamental features of microswimmers, focusing on their reciprocal
deformation. Although the scallop theorem prohibits the net locomotion of a
reciprocal microswimmer, by analyzing a two-sphere swimmer model, we show that
in a fluctuating and geometrically confined environment, reciprocal
deformations can give rise to a displacement as a statistical average. To
elucidate this symmetry breakdown, by introducing an impulse response function,
we derived a general formula that predicts the non-zero net displacement of the
reciprocal swimmer. With this theory, we revealed the relationship between the
shape gait and the net locomotion, as well as the net diffusion constant
enhanced and suppressed by the swimmer's deformation. These findings, together
with a theoretical formulation, provide a fundamental basis for
environment-coupled statistical locomotion. Thus, this study will be valuable
in understanding biophysical phenomena in fluctuating environments, designing
artificial microrobots, and conducting laboratory experiments.

Silicon carbide is a hard, semiconducting material presenting many polytypes,
whose behavior under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature has
attracted large interest. Here we study the mechanical properties of 3C-SiC
over a wide range of pressures (compressive and tensile) by means of molecular
dynamics simulations, using an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian to describe
the interatomic interactions. The accuracy of this procedure has been checked
by comparing results at T = 0 with those derived from ab-initio
density-functional-theory calculations. This has allowed us to determine the
metastability limits of this material and in particular the spinodal point
(where the bulk modulus vanishes) as a function of temperature. At T = 300 K,
the spinodal instability appears for a lattice parameter about 20% larger than
that corresponding to ambient pressure. At this temperature, we find a spinodal
pressure P_s = -43 GPa, which becomes less negative as temperature is raised
(P_s = -37.9 GPa at 1500 K). These results pave the way for a deeper
understanding of the behavior of crystalline semiconductors in a poorly known
region of their phase diagrams.

We compare the acoustic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with two of its
optical variants where the phonons are defined on either on the sites or bonds
of the system. First, we discuss how to make fair comparisons between these
models in any dimension by ensuring their dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ and
relevant phonon energies are the same. We then use determinant quantum Monte
Carlo to perform non-perturbative and sign-problem-free simulations of all
three models on one-dimensional chains at and away from half-filling. By
comparing the results obtained from each model, we demonstrate that the optical
and acoustic models produce near identical results within error bars for
suitably chosen phonon energies and $\lambda$ at half-filling. In contrast, the
bond model has quantitatively different behavior due to its coupling to the $q
= 0$ phonon mode. These differences also manifest in the total length of the
chain, which shrinks for the bond model but not for the acoustic and optical
models when $\lambda \neq 0$. Our results have important implications for
quantum Monte Carlo modeling of SSH-like interactions, where these models are
sometimes regarded as being interchangeable

<h3>Connecting the Branches of Multistable Non-Euclidean Origami by Crease  Stretching</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-Euclidean origami is a promising technique for designing multistable
deployable structures folded from nonplanar developable surfaces. The
impossibility of flat foldability inherent to non-Euclidean origami results in
two disconnected solution branches each with the same angular deficiency but
opposite handedness. We show that these regions can be connected via "crease
stretching" wherein the creases exhibit extensibility in addition to torsional
stiffness. We further reveal that crease stretching acts as an energy storage
method capable of passive deployment and control. Specifically, we show that in
a Miura-Ori system with a single stretchable crease, this is achieved via two
unique, easy to realize, equilibrium folding pathways for a certain wide set of
parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that this connection mostly preserves
the stable states of the non-Euclidean system, while resulting a third stable
state enabled only by the interaction of crease torsion and stretching.
Finally, we show that this simplified model can be used as an efficient and
robust tool for inverse design of multistable origami based on closed-form
predictions that yield the system parameters required to attain multiple,
desired stable shapes. This facilitates the implementation of multistable
origami for applications in architecture materials, robotics, and deployable
structures.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (ML-IAPs) enable quantum-accurate
classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large systems, including
defects like dislocations and cracks. While various ML-IAPs are able to
replicate DFT per-atom energies with root-mean-square error (RMSE) ~1 meV, the
ability to accurately predict systems larger than density functional theory
(DFT) supercells is unclear to date. Based on two independent DFT databases, we
optimise a variety of ML-IAPs based on four state-of-the-art packages and show
the Pareto front of the computational speed versus testing energy and force
RMSE. We then perform extensive validation on a broad range of properties that
are crucial to simulate plasticity and fracture of metals. The core structures
and Peierls barriers of screw, M111 and three edge dislocations are compared
with DFT/MD results from published literature. We find that these properties
can be sensitive to the database and the ML scheme. Next, we compute the
traction-separation curve and critical stress intensity factor based on K-test,
in which the effects of the database and cutoff radius are visible. Cleavage on
the pre-existing crack plane, without dislocation emission, is found to be the
atomistic fracture mechanism under pure mode-I loading, independent of the ML
packages and the training DFT database. Our findings not only reveal the
correlation between RMSE and the average error of predicted physical
properties, the dislocation properties, and fracture mechanism in bcc iron but
also highlight the importance of validating ML-IAPs by using indicators beyond
RMSE, including model uncertainty quantification.

The technique of muon spin rotation ({\mu}SR) has emerged in the last few

<br>
The Weyl-Mott insulator (WMI) has been postulated as a novel type of
correlated insulator with non-trivial topological properties. We introduce a
minimal microscopic model that captures generic features of the WMI transition
in Weyl semimetals. The model hosts a bulk Mott insulator with spinon Fermi
arcs on its surfaces which we identify as a WMI. At finite temperatures, we
find an intermediate Weyl semimetallic phase with no quasiparticles which is
consistent with the bad semimetallic behavior observed in pyrochlore iridates,
A2Ir2O7, close to the Mott transition. Spinon Fermi arcs lead to a suppression
of the bulk Mott gap at the surface of the WMI, in contrast to the gap
enhancement found in conventional Mott insulators, which can be detected
through angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

We establish how active stress globally affects the morphology of
disclination lines of a three dimensional active nematic liquid crystal under
chaotic flow. Thanks to a defect detection algorithm based on the local nematic
orientation, we show that activity selects a crossover length scale in between
the size of small defect loops and the one of long and tangled defect lines of
fractal dimension $2$. This length scale crossover is consistent with the
scaling of the average separation between defects as a function of activity.
Moreover, on the basis of numerical simulation in a 3D periodic geometry, we
show the presence of a network of regular defect loops, contractible onto the
$3$-torus, always coexisting with wrapping defect lines. While the length of
regular defects scales linearly with the emerging active length scale, it
verifies an inverse quadratic dependence for wrapping defects. The shorter the
active length scale, the more the defect lines wrap around the periodic
boundaries, resulting in extremely long and buckled structures.

The separation of carbon dioxide CO$_2$ from nitrogen gas (N$_2$), the main
component of flue gas, has become an emerging action to mitigate climate
change. Feasible and efficient approaches to exploring the separation
properties of materials are molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations. In these approaches, a careful choice of force fields is required
to avoid unrealistic predictions of thermodynamic properties. However, most
studies use Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules (LB) to obtain the interaction
between different species, an approximation that could not capture the essence
of interfacial interactions. In this context, we verified how accurate LB is in
describing the interaction of N$_2$ molecules and carbon nanostructures by
comparing the interaction energies from LB with those from density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. We selected carbon nanomaterials because they are
considered promising materials to perform N$_2$/CO$_2$ separation. The results
show that the LB underestimates the interaction energies and affects the
prediction of fundamental properties of solid-fluid interfacial interactions.
To overcome this limitation, we parametrized a Lennard-Jones potential using
energies and forces from DFT, obtained through the van der Waals functional
KBM. The proposed potential show good transferability and agreement to
ab-initio calculations. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were performed
to verify the effects of employing LB in predicting the amount of nitrogen gas
adsorbed inside different CNTs. LB predicts a lower density inside them.
Moreover, our results suggest that LB leads to a different characterization of
the adsorption properties of carbon nanotubes, by changing significantly the
adsorption isotherm.

A grid method using tiling by fundamental domain of simple 2D lattices is
presented. It refer to a previous work done by Stampfli in $1986$ using two
tilings by regular hexagons, one rotate by $\pi/2$ relatively to the other.
This allows to get a quasiperiodic structure with a twelve fold symmetry. The
quasiperiodic structure is a tiling of the plane by regular triangles, squares
and rhombuses. This can be extented to other examples of tilings by fundamental
domain. Two other examples are proposed. The first example also based on the
hexagonal lattice, but with grids defined by the fundamental rhombic domain
formed by two regular triangles. The second example presents the case of a
square lattice with a square fundamental domain.

Swimming in low-Reynolds-number fluids requires the breaking of time-reversal
symmetry and centrosymmetry. Microswimmers, often with asymmetric shapes,
exhibit nonreciprocal motions or exploit nonequilibrium processes to propel.
The role of surrounding fluids has also attracted attention because
viscoelastic, non-Newtonian, and anisotropic properties of fluids matter in
propulsion efficiency and navigation. Here we experimentally demonstrate that
anisotropic fluids, nematic liquid crystals (NLC), can make a pulsating
spherical bubble swim despite its centrosymmetric shape and time-symmetric
motion. The NLC breaks the centrosymmetry by a deformed nematic director field
with a topological defect accompanying the bubble. The nematodynamics renders
the nonreciprocity in the pulsation-induced fluid flow. We also report the
speed enhancement by confinement and the propulsion of another symmetry-broken
bubble dressed by a bent disclination. Our experiments and theory elucidate
another possible mechanism of moving bodies in complex fluids by spatiotemporal
symmetry breaking.

We theoretically investigate the pure dephasing dynamics of two static
impurity qubits embedded within a common environment of ultracold fermionic
atoms, which are confined to one spatial dimension. Our goal is to understand
how bath-mediated interactions between impurities affect their performance as
nonequilibrium quantum thermometers. By solving the dynamics exactly using a
functional determinant approach, we show that the impurities become correlated
via retarded interactions of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type. Moreover,
we demonstrate that these correlations can provide a metrological advantage,
enhancing the sensitivity of the two-qubit thermometer beyond that of two
independent impurities. This enhancement is most prominent in the limit of low
temperature and weak collisional coupling between the impurities and the gas.
We show that this precision advantage can be exploited using standard Ramsey
interferometry, with no need to prepare correlated initial states nor to
individually manipulate or measure the impurities. We also quantitatively
assess the impact of ignoring these correlations when constructing a
temperature estimate, finding that acceptable precision can still be achieved
from a simplified model of independent impurities. Our results demonstrate the
rich nonequilibrium physics of impurities dephasing in a common Fermi gas, and
may help to provide better temperature estimates at ultralow temperatures.

<h3>The impact of the interfacial Kapitza resistance on colloidal  thermophoresis</h3>

Thermal gradients impart a force on colloidal particles pushing the colloids
towards cold or hot regions, a phenomenon called thermophoresis. Existing
theories describe thermophoresis by considering the local perturbation of the
thermal field around the colloid. While these approaches incorporate
interfacial surface free energies, they have consistently ignored the impact of
the Kapitza resistance associated with the colloid-solvent interface. We
propose a theoretical approach to include interfacial Kapitza resistance
effects, and we test the new equations using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations. We demonstrate that the Kapitza resistance influences the local
thermal field around a colloid, modifying the Soret coefficient. We conclude
that interfacial thermal conductance effects must be included to describe
thermophoresis.

Predicting material properties of 3D printed polymer products is a challenge
in additive manufacturing due to the highly localized and complex manufacturing
process. The microstructure of 3D printed products is fundamentally different
from the ones obtained by using conventional manufacturing processes, which
makes the task even more difficult. As a first step of a systematic multiscale
approach, in this work, we have developed an artificial neural network (ANN) to
predict the mechanical properties of the crystalline form of Polyamide12 (PA12)
based on data collected from molecular dynamics simulations. Using the machine
learning approach, we are able to predict the stress-strain relations of PA12
once the information of the macroscale deformation gradient is provided as the
input parameter to the ANN. We have shown that this is an efficient and
accurate approach, which can provide a three-dimensional molecular-level
anisotropic stress-strain relation of PA12 for any macroscale mechanics model,
such as finite element modeling at arbitrary quadrature points.

Understanding the properties of supercooled fluids in equilibrium, even below
the calorimetric glass transition $T_g$, is an elusive challenge. This is even
more true for the properties of the ideal glass, defined as the minimum of the
potential energy landscape (PEL) in the non-crystalline regime. Although its
existence is a mathematical necessity due to the finite range of energies, its
properties, and physical relevance are still undecided. Here we combine the
million-fold acceleration of Swap Monte Carlo with PEL analysis to study a
non-network 2D model glass former in equilibrium for a wide range of system
sizes and temperatures. We observe the transition from fragile to strong
behavior and provide a generic perspective to such observations in many
experimental non-network glass formers, or the saturation of structural
disorder upon cooling. Furthermore, we can identify a particular system size
that shows quantitative agreement with the macroscopic limit, while allowing a
complete characterization of the potential energy landscape (PEL) down to its
global minimum. This implies the availability of configurational entropy down
to the zero temperature limit without the detour via liquid entropy, thereby
quantifying the putative entropy crisis. Through appropriate system size
analysis, we can identify a low-energy depletion regime, including the ideal
glass, and reveal its physical relevance for equilibrium properties over a wide
temperature range, including below $T_g$.

<h3>The s$^\pm$-Wave Pairing and the Destructive Role of Apical-Oxygen  Deficiencies in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Under Pressure</h3>

Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been
reported to show evidence of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) under a
mild pressure of about 14 GP. To investigate the superconducting mechanism and
pairing symmetry of the material, we perform a random-phase-approximation (RPA)
based study on a bilayer two-orbital model, on both the perfect crystal and
that with apical-oxygen deficiencies. Our results on the perfect crystal
suggest that the leading pairing symmetry is the $s^\pm$-wave pairing with
dominant $d_{3z^2-r^2}$-orbital content. The emergence of the $\gamma$- pocket
centering around the Brillouin zone corner under pressure is crucial for this
pairing. Then we focus on the role of the apical-oxygen deficiencies on the SC,
based on a real-space RPA calculation. Our results reveal that local
antiferromagnetic moment emerges in the region with rich apical-oxygen
deficiencies due to lowering of the magnetic critical interaction strength,
which is harmful for the formation of SC. Our results indicate that sufficient
oxygen pressure is necessary to enhance the superconducting critical
temperature of the material.

<h3>Altermagnetic surface states: towards the observation and utilization of  altermagnetism in thin films, interfaces and topological materials</h3>

The altermagnetism influences the electronic states allowing the presence of
non-relativistic spinsplittings. Since altermagnetic spin-splitting is present
along specific k-paths of the 3D Brillouin zone, we expect that the
altermagnetic surface states will be present on specific surface orientations.
We unveil the properties of the altermagnetic surface states considering three
representative space groups: tetragonal, orthorhombic and hexagonal. We
calculate the 2D projected Brillouin zone from the 3D Brillouin zone. We study
the surfaces with their respective 2D Brillouin zones establishing where the
spin-splittings with opposite sign merge annihilating the altermagnetic
properties and on which surfaces the altermagnetism is preserved. Looking at
the three principal surface orientations, we find that for several cases two
surfaces are blind to the altermagnetism, while the altermagnetism survives for
one surface orientation. Which surface preserves the altermagnetism depends
also on the magnetic order. We show that an electric field orthogonal to the
blind surface can activate the altermagnetism. Our results predict which
surfaces to cleave in order to preserve altermagnetism in surfaces or
interfaces and this paves the way to observe non-relativistic altermagnetic
spin-splitting in thin films via spin-resolved ARPES and to interface the
altermagnetism with other collective modes. We open future perspectives for the
study of altermagnetic effects on the trivial and topological surface states.

The chiral edge current is the boundary manifestation of the Chern number of
a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator. Its direct observation is assumed to
require well-quantized Hall conductance, and is so far lacking. The recently
discovered van der Waals antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is theorized as a QAH
in odd-layers but has shown Hall resistivity below the quantization value at
zero magnetic field. Here, we perform scanning superconducting quantum
interference device (sSQUID) microscopy on these seemingly failed QAH
insulators to image their current distribution. When gated to the charge
neutral point, our device exhibits edge current, which flows unidirectionally
on the odd-layer boundary both with vacuum and with the even-layer. The
chirality of such edge current reverses with the magnetization of the bulk.
Surprisingly, we find the edge channels coexist with finite bulk conduction
even though the bulk chemical potential is in the band gap, suggesting their
robustness under significant edge-bulk scattering. Our result establishes the
existence of chiral edge currents in a topological antiferromagnet and offers
an alternative for identifying QAH states.

Variability in multiple independent input parameters makes it difficult to
estimate the resultant variability in the system's overall response. The
Propagation of Errors and Monte-Carlo techniques are two major methods to
predict the variability of a system. However, in the former method, the
formalism can lead to an inaccurate estimate for systems that have parameters
varying over a wide range. For the latter, the results give a direct estimate
of the variance of the response, but for complex systems with many parameters,
the number of trials necessary to yield an accurate estimate can be very large
to the point the technique becomes impractical. In this study, the
effectiveness of the Tolerance Design method to estimate variability in complex
systems is studied. We use a linear elastic 3 point bending beam model and a
nonlinear extended finite elements crack growth model to test and compare the
PE and MC methods with the TD method. Results from an MC estimate, using 10,000
trials, serve as a reference to validate the result in both cases. We find that
the PE method works suboptimal for a coefficient of variance above 5% in the
input variables. In addition, we find that the TD method works very well with
moderately sized trials of designed experiment for both models. Our results
demonstrate how the variability estimation methods perform in the deterministic
domain of numerical simulations and can assist in designing physical tests by
providing a guideline performance measure.

The Bloch point is a point singularity in the magnetisation configuration,
where the magnetisation vanishes. It can exist as an equilibrium configuration
and plays an important role in many magnetisation reversal processes. In the
present work, we focus on manipulating Bloch points in a system that can host
stable Bloch points - a two-layer FeGe nanostrip with opposite chirality of the
two layers. We drive Bloch points using spin-transfer torques and find that
Bloch points can move collectively without any Hall effect and report that
Bloch points are repelled from the sample boundaries and each other. We study
pinning of Bloch points at wedge-shaped constrictions (notches) in the
nanostrip and demonstrate that arrays of Bloch points can be moved past a
series of notches in a controlled manner by applying consecutive current pulses
of different strength. Finally, we simulate a T-shaped geometry and demonstrate
that a Bloch point can be moved along different paths by applying current
between suitable strip ends.
