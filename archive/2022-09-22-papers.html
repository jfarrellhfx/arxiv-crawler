<h3>Dynamics of photo-induced ferromagnetism in oxides with orbital  degeneracy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10567</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan B. Curtis, Ankit Disa, Michael Fechner, Andrea Cavalleri, Prineha Narang</i>
<br>
By using intense coherent electromagnetic radiation, it may be possible to
manipulate the properties of quantum materials very quickly, or even induce new
and potentially useful phases that are absent in equilibrium. For instance,
ultrafast control of magnetic dynamics is crucial for a number of proposed
spintronic devices and can also shed light on the possible dynamics of
correlated phases out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent experiments on
spin-orbital ferromagnet YTiO$_3$ we consider the nonequilibrium dynamics of
Heisenberg ferromagnetic insulator with low-lying orbital excitations. We model
the dynamics of the magnon excitations in this system following an optical
pulse which resonantly excites infrared-active phonon modes. As the phonons
ring down they can dynamically couple the orbitals with the low-lying magnons,
leading to a dramatically modified effective bath for the magnons. We show this
transient coupling can lead to a dynamical acceleration of the magnetization
dynamics, which is otherwise bottlenecked by small anisotropy. Exploring the
parameter space more we find that the magnon dynamics can also even completely
reverse, leading to a negative relaxation rate when the pump is blue-detuned
with respect to the orbital bath resonance. We therefore show that by using
specially targeted optical pulses, one can exert a much greater degree of
control over the magnetization dynamics, allowing one to optically steer
magnetic order in this system. We conclude by discussing interesting parallels
between the magnetization dynamics we find here and recent experiments on
photo-induced superconductivity, where it is similarly observed that depending
on the initial pump frequency, an apparent metastable superconducting phase
emerges.

<h3>Exact solution for finite center-of-mass momentum Cooper pairing</h3>

<br>
Pair density waves (PDWs) are superconducting states formed by ``Cooper
pairs" of electrons containing a non-zero center-of-mass momentum. They are
characterized by a spatially modulated order parameter and may occur in a
variety of emerging quantum materials such as cuprates, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) and Kagome metals. Despite extensive theoretical and
numerical studies seeking PDWs in a variety of lattices and interacting
settings, there is currently no generic and robust mechanism that favors a
modulated solution of the superconducting order parameter in the presence of
time reversal symmetry. Here, we study the problem of two electrons subject to
an anisotropic ($d$-wave) attractive potential. We solve the two-body
Schrodinger wave equation exactly to determine the pair binding energy as a
function of the center-of-mass momentum. We find that a modulated (finite
momentum) pair is favored over a homogeneous (zero momentum) solution above a
critical interaction. Using this insight from the exact two-body solution, we
construct a BCS-like variational many-body wave function and calculate the free
energy and superconducting gap as a function of the center-of-mass momentum. A
zero temperature analysis of the energy shows that the conclusions of the
two-body problem are robust in the many-body limit. Our results lay the
theoretical and microscopic foundation for the existence of PDWs.

<h3>Optical properties and carrier localization in the layered phosphide  EuCd$_\mathbf{2}$P$_\mathbf{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10606" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10606</a>
<br>
<i>C. C. Homes, Z.-C. Wang, K. Fruhling, F. Tafti</i>
<br>
The temperature dependence of the complex optical properties of the layered
phosphide material EuCd$_2$P$_2$ has been measured over a wide frequency range
above and below $T_{\rm N} \simeq 11.5$ K for light polarized in the $a-b$
planes. At room temperature, the optical conductivity is well described by a
weak free-carrier component with a Drude plasma frequency of $\simeq 1100$
cm$^{-1}$ and a scattering rate of $1/\tau_D\simeq 700$ cm$^{-1}$, with the
onset of interband absorptions above $\simeq 2000$ cm$^{-1}$. Two
infrared-active $E_u$ modes are observed at $\simeq\,$89 and 239 cm$^{-1}$. As
the temperature is reduced the scattering rate decreases and the low-frequency
conductivity increases slightly; however, below $\simeq 50$ K the conductivity
decreases until at the resistivity maximum at $\simeq 18$ K (just below
$2T_{\rm N}$) the spectral weight associated with free carriers is transferred
to a localized excitation at $\simeq 500$ cm$^{-1}$. Below $T_{\rm N}$,
metallic behavior is recovered. Interestingly, the $E_u$ modes are largely
unaffected by these changes, with only the position of the high-frequency mode
showing any signs of anomalous behavior. While several scenarios are
considered, the prevailing view is that the resistivity maximum and subsequent
carrier localization is due to the formation of ferromagnetic domains below
$\simeq 2T_{\rm N}$ that result in spin-polarized clusters due to spin-carrier
coupling [1].

<h3>Ferro-axial nature under vortex spin textures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10657" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10657</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<br>
The nature of an electric ferro-axial moment characterizing a
time-reversal-even axial-vector quantity is theoretically investigated under
magnetic orderings. We clarify that a vortex spin texture results in the
emergence of the ferro-axial moment depending on the helicity. By introducing a
multipole description, we show that the ferro-axial nature appears when two
types of odd-parity magnetic multipoles become active under the vortex spin
texture: One is the magnetic monopole and the other is the magnetic toroidal
dipole. We present all the magnetic point groups to possess the ferro-axial
moment in the presence of the magnetic orderings with the magnetic monopole and
magnetic toroidal dipole. Moreover, we specifically consider a multi-orbital
model in a four-sublattice tetragonal system to demonstrate the ferro-axial
moment induced by the vortex spin texture. We show that the ferro-axial moment
is microscopically characterized by both the cluster-scale and atomic-scale
axial-vector quantities: The former is described by the vortex of the local
electric dipole and the latter is represented by the outer product of the local
orbital and spin angular momenta. Moreover, we find that the atomic-spin orbit
coupling and the hybridization between orbitals with different parity are key
ingredients to induce the ferro-axial moment. We also apply the result to a
magnetic skyrmion with a topologically-nontrivial spin texture and discuss
candidate materials.

<h3>Role of higher-order interactions on the modulational instability of  Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a periodic optical lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10701" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10701</a>
<br>
<i>S.Sabari, OT.Lekeufack, SB.Yamgoue, R.Tamilthiruvalluvar, R.Radha</i>
<br>
In this paper, we investigate the impact of higher-order interactions on the
modulational instability (MI) of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) immersed in
an optical lattice potential. We derive the new variational equations for the
time evolution of amplitude, phase of modulational perturbation, and effective
potential for the system. Through effective potential techniques, we find that
high density attractive and repulsive BECs exhibit new character with direct
impact over the MI phenomenon. Results of intensive numerical investigations
are presented and their convergence with the above semi analytical approach is
brought out.

<h3>Enskog kinetic theory of binary granular suspensions: heat flux and  stability analysis of the homogeneous steady state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10869" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10869</a>
<br>
<i>Rubén Gómez González, Vicente Garzó</i>
<br>
The Enskog kinetic theory of multicomponent granular suspensions employed
previously [G\'omez Gonz\'alez, Khalil, and Garz\'o, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{101},
012904 (2020)] is considered further to determine the four transport
coefficients associated with the heat flux. These transport coefficients are
obtained by solving the Enskog equation by means of the application of the
Chapman--Enskog method around the local version of the homogeneous state.
Explicit forms of the heat flux transport coefficients are provided in
steady-state conditions by considering the so-called second Sonine
approximation to the distribution function of each species. Their quantitative
variation on the control parameters of the mixture (masses and diameters,
coefficients of restitution, concentration, volume fraction, and the background
temperature) is demonstrated and the results show that in general the
dependence of the heat flux transport coefficients on inelasticity is clearly
different from that found in the absence of the gas phase (\emph{dry} granular
mixtures). As an application of the general results, the stability of the
homogeneous steady state is analyzed by solving the linearized Navier--Stokes
hydrodynamic equations. The linear stability analysis (which holds for
wavelengths long compared with the mean free path) shows that the transversal
and longitudinal modes are always stable with respect to long-enough wavelength
excitations. This conclusion agrees with previous results derived for
monocomponent and (dilute) bidisperse granular suspensions but contrasts with
the instabilities found in previous works in dry (no gas phase) granular
mixtures.

<h3>Symmetry-breaking transition between defect-free and defect-laden  turbulence in polar active matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10916" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10916</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin H. Andersen, Julian Renaud, Jonnas Rønning, Luiza Angheluta, Amin Doostmohammadi</i>
<br>
Coherent flows of self-propelled particles are characterized by vortices and
jets that sustain chaotic flows, referred to as active turbulence. Here, we
reveal a transition between defect-free active turbulence and active turbulence
laden with defects. Interestingly, we show that concurrent to the transition
from defect-free active turbulence to defect-laden turbulence is the
restoration of the previously broken $U(1)$-symmetry and fast decay of the
two-point correlations which suggests a symmetry-breaking transition. By
stability analyses of the topological charge density field, we provide an
analytical prediction of the activity threshold for the transition to the
defect-laden active turbulent state. Moreover, despite the distinct symmetry
features between the defect-free and defect-laden active turbulence, we
demonstrate universal behaviors for the self-similarity of the flow
fluctuations at large scales, and exponential decay of polarity power spectrum,
at small length scales compared to the active energy injection length. It is
further shown that increasing the self-propulsion of the active particles
results in exponential rarefaction of topological defects and a transition from
active defect-laden turbulence to a flocking state. These findings reveal new
dynamical transitions between distinct spatiotemporal organization patterns in
polar active mater.

<h3>Investigating shock wave propagation, evolution, and anisotropy using a  moving window concurrent atomistic-continuum framework</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10985" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10985</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander S. Davis, Vinamra Agrawal</i>
<br>
Despite their success in microscale modeling of materials, atomistic methods
are still limited by short time scales, small domain sizes, and high strain
rates. Multiscale formulations can capture the continuum-level response of
solids over longer runtimes, but using such schemes to model highly dynamic,
nonlinear phenomena is very challenging and an active area of research. In this
work, we develop novel techniques within the concurrent atomistic-continuum
multiscale framework to simulate shock wave propagation through a
two-dimensional, single-crystal lattice. The technique is described in detail,
and two moving window methods are incorporated to track the shock front through
the domain and thus prevent spurious wave reflections at the
atomistic-continuum interfaces. We compare our simulation results to analytical
models as well as previous atomistic and CAC data and discuss the apparent
effects of lattice orientation on the shock response of FCC crystals. We then
use the moving window techniques to perform parametric studies which analyze
the shock front's structure and planarity. Finally we compare the efficiency of
our model to molecular dynamics simulations. This work showcases the power of
using a moving window concurrent multiscale framework to simulate dynamic shock
evolution over long runtimes and opens the door to more complex studies
involving shock propagation through composites and high-entropy alloys.

<h3>Efficient variational approach to the Fermi polaron problem in two  dimensions, both in and out of equilibrium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10998</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Fan Qu, Pavel E. Dolgirev, Eugene Demler, Tao Shi</i>
<br>
We develop a non-Gaussian variational approach that enables us to study both
equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium physics of the two-dimensional Fermi
polaron. This method provides an unbiased analysis of the polaron-to-molecule
phase transition without relying on truncations in the total number of
particle-hole excitations. Our results -- which include the ground state energy
and quasiparticle residue -- are in qualitative agreement with the known Monte
Carlo calculations. The main advantage of the non-Gaussian states compared to
conventional numerical methods is that they enable us to explore long-time
polaron evolution and, in particular, study various spectral properties
accessible to both solid-state and ultracold atom experiments. We design two
types of radiofrequency spectroscopies to measure polaronic and molecular
spectral functions. Depending on the parameter regime, we find that these
spectral functions and fermionic density profiles near the impurity display
either long-lived oscillations between the repulsive and attractive polaron
branches or exhibit fast relaxational dynamics to the molecular state.

<h3>Biskyrmion-based artificial neuron with refractory period</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11017" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11017</a>
<br>
<i>Ismael Ribeiro de Assis, Ingrid Mertig, Börge Göbel</i>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale magnetic whirls that are highly stable and
can be moved by currents which has led to the prediction of a skyrmion-based
artificial neuron device with leak-integrate-fire functionality. However, so
far, these devices lack a refractory process, estimated to be crucial for
neuronal dynamics. Here we demonstrate that a biskyrmion-based artificial
neuron overcomes this insufficiency. When driven by spin-orbit torques, a
single biskyrmion splits into two subskyrmions that move towards a designated
location and can be detected electrically, resembling the excitation process of
a neuron that fires ultimately. The attractive interaction of the two skyrmions
leads to a unique trajectory: Once they reach the detector area, they
automatically return to the center to reform the biskyrmion but on a different
path. During this reset period, the neuron cannot fire again. Our suggested
device resembles a biological neuron with the leak, integrate, fire and
refractory characteristics better than all existing artificial devices so far.

<h3>Active Glassy Dynamics is Unaffected by the Microscopic Details of  Self-Propulsion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11098" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11098</a>
<br>
<i>Vincent E. Debets, Liesbeth M.C. Janssen</i>
<br>
Recent years have seen a rapid increase of interest in dense active
materials, which, in the disordered state, share striking similarities with
conventional passive glass-forming matter. For such passive glassy materials,
it is well established (at least in three dimensions) that the details of the
microscopic dynamics, e.g., Newtonian or Brownian, do not influence the
long-time glassy behavior. Here we investigate whether this still holds true in
the non-equilibrium active case by considering two simple and widely used
active particle models, i.e., active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) and
active Brownian particles (ABPs). In particular, we seek to gain more insight
into the role of the self-propulsion mechanism on the glassy dynamics by
deriving a mode-coupling theory (MCT) for thermal AOUPs, which can be directly
compared to a recently developed MCT for ABPs. Both theories explicitly take
into account the active degrees of freedom. We solve the AOUP- and ABP-MCT
equations in two dimensions and demonstrate that both models give almost
identical results for the intermediate scattering function over a large variety
of control parameters (packing fractions, active speeds, and persistence
times). We also confirm this theoretical equivalence between the different
self-propulsion mechanisms numerically via simulations of a polydisperse
mixture of active quasi-hard spheres, thereby establishing that, at least for
these model systems, the microscopic details of self-propulsion do not alter
the active glassy behavior.

<h3>Interacting topological quantum chemistry of Mott atomic limits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10556</a>
<br>
<i>Martina O. Soldini, Nikita Astrakhantsev, Mikel Iraola, Apoorv Tiwari, Mark H. Fischer, Roser Valentí, Maia G. Vergniory, Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</i>
<br>
Topological quantum chemistry (TQC) is a successful framework for identifying
(non-interacting) topological materials. Based on the symmetry eigenvalues of
Bloch eigenstates at high symmetry momenta, which are attainable from first
principles calculations, a band structure can either be classified as an atomic
limit, in other words adiabatically connected to independent electronic
orbitals on the respective crystal lattice, or it is topological. For
interacting systems, there is no single-particle band structure and hence, the
TQC machinery grinds to a halt. We develop a framework analogous to TQC, but
employing $n$-particle Green's function to classify interacting systems.
Fundamentally, we define a class of interacting reference states that
generalize the notion of atomic limits, which we call Mott atomic limits. Our
formalism allows to fully classify these reference states (with $n=2$), which
can themselves represent symmetry protected topological states. We present a
comprehensive classification of such states in one and two-dimensions and
provide numerical results on model systems. With this, we establish Mott atomic
limit states as a generalization of the atomic limits to interacting systems.

<h3>Symmetry indicators in commensurate magnetic flux</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10557" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10557</a>
<br>
<i>Yuan Fang, Jennifer Cano</i>
<br>
We derive a framework to apply topological quantum chemistry in systems
subject to magnetic flux. We start by deriving the action of spatial symmetry
operators in a uniform magnetic field, which extends Zak's magnetic translation
groups to all crystal symmetry groups. Ultimately, the magnetic symmetries form
a projective representation of the crystal symmetry group. As a consequence,
band representations acquire an extra gauge invariant phase compared to the
non-magnetic theory. Thus, the theory of symmetry indicators is distinct from
the non-magnetic case. We give examples of new symmetry indicators that appear
at $\pi$ flux. Finally, we apply our results to an obstructed atomic insulator
with corner states in a magnetic field. The symmetry indicators reveal a
topological-to-trivial phase transition at finite flux, which is confirmed by a
Hofstadter butterfly calculation. The bulk phase transition provides a new

Adding magnetic flux to a band structure breaks Bloch's theorem by realizing
a projective representation of the translation group. The resulting Hofstadter
spectrum encodes the non-perturbative response of the bands to flux. Depending
on their topology, adding flux can enforce a bulk gap closing (a Hofstadter
semimetal) or boundary state pumping (a Hofstadter topological insulator). In
this work, we present a real-space classification of these Hofstadter phases.
We give topological indices in terms of symmetry-protected Real Space
Invariants (RSIs) which encode bulk and boundary responses of fragile
topological states to flux. In fact, we find that the flux periodicity in
tight-binding models causes the symmetries which are broken by the magnetic
field to reenter at strong flux where they form projective point group
representations. We completely classify the reentrant projective point groups
and find that the Schur multipliers which define them are Arahanov-Bohm phases
calculated along the bonds of the crystal. We find that a nontrivial Schur
multiplier is enough to predict and protect the Hofstadter response with only
zero-flux topology.

<br>
A recent experiment showed that proximity induced Ising spin-orbit coupling
enhances the spin-triplet superconductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene. Here,
we show that, due to the nearly perfect spin rotation symmetry of graphene, the
fluctuations of the spin orientation of the triplet order parameter suppress
the superconducting transition to nearly zero temperature. Our analysis shows
that both Ising spin-orbit coupling and in-plane magnetic field can eliminate
these low-lying fluctuations and can greatly enhance the transition
temperature, consistent with the recent experiment. Our model also suggests the
possible existence of a phase at small anisotropy and magnetic field which
exhibits quasi-long-range ordered spin-singlet charge 4e superconductivity,
even while the triplet 2e superconducting order only exhibits short-ranged
correlations. Finally, we discuss relevant experimental signatures.

<br>
Quantum gas microscopy has developed into a powerful tool to explore strongly
correlated quantum systems. However, discerning phases with topological or
off-diagonal long range order requires the ability to extract these
correlations from site-resolved measurements. Here, we show that a multi-scale
complexity measure can pinpoint the transition to and from the bond ordered
wave phase of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model with an off-diagonal
order parameter, sandwiched between diagonal charge and spin density wave
phases, using only diagonal descriptors. We study the model directly in the
thermodynamic limit using the recently developed variational uniform matrix
product states algorithm, and draw our samples from degenerate ground states
related by global spin rotations, emulating the projective measurements that
are accessible in experiments. Our results will have important implications for
the study of exotic phases using optical lattice experiments.

<br>
We report high resolution polar Kerr effect measurements on CsV${}_3$Sb${}_5$
single crystals in search for signatures of spontaneous time reversal symmetry
breaking below the charge order transition at $T^* \approx 94$ K. Utilizing two
different versions of zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550
nm wavelength, each with the fundamental attribute that without a time reversal
symmetry breaking sample at its path, the interferometer is perfectly
reciprocal, we find no observable Kerr effect to within the noise floor limit
of the apparatus at 30 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent reflection ratio
measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in the same
optical volume as the Kerr measurements. At finite magnetic field we observe a
sharp onset of a diamagnetic shift in the Kerr signal at $T^*$, which persists
down to the lowest temperature without change in trend. Since 1550 nm is an
energy that was shown to capture all features of the optical properties of the
material that interact with the charge order transition, we are led to conclude
that it is highly unlikely that time reversal symmetry is broken in the charge
ordered state in CsV${}_3$Sb${}_5$.

We provide a novel methodological approach to the estimate of the change of
the Quantum Vacuum electromagnetic energy density in a High critical
Temperature superconducting metal bulk sample, when it undergoes the transition
in temperature, from the superconducting to the normal phase. The various
contributions to the Casimir energy in the two phases are highlighted and
compared. While the TM polarization of the vacuum mode allows for a macroscopic
description of the superconducting transition, the changes in the TE vacuum
mode induced by the superconductive correlations are introduced within a
microscopic model, which does not explicitly take into account the anisotropic
structure of the material.

<h3>Heterogeneity transforms subdiffusion into superdiffusion via ensemble  self-reinforcement</h3>

<br>
<i>Sergei Fedotov, Daniel Han</i>
<br>
We formulate a subdiffusive master equation in continuous time with random
transition probabilities such that the ensemble of random walks exhibits
superdiffusion. This counter intuitive result is explained by the ensemble
self-reinforcement phenomenon, which emulates conditional transition rates of
an underlying discrete random walk with strong memory through a heterogeneous
ensemble. We find the ensemble averaged solution of this master equation and
the exact equation for the second moment, which exhibits superdiffusion.
Ensemble self-reinforcement allows a smooth transition between subdiffusion and
superdiffusion depending on a single parameter.

Structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, energy storage properties, and
electrocaloric effect were studied in lead-free ceramic
Ba$_{0.95}$Ca$_{0.05}$Ti$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$O$_3$ (BCTSn) elaborated by sol-gel
method. Phase purity structure was confirmed from X-ray data using Rietveld
refinement analysis which revealed the coexistence of tetragonal (P4mm) and
orthorhombic (Amm2) symmetries at room temperature. Phase transitions were
detected by dielectric and differential scanning calorimetry results. Energy
storage properties were determined from P-E hysteresis, and the electrocaloric
properties were calculated indirectly via the Maxwell approach. The large value
of electrocaloric temperature change of $\Delta$T=0.807 K obtained at a
relatively small field of 30 kV cm$^{-1}$ and high energy storage efficiency
can make BCTSn ceramic a promising candidate for environmentally friendly

The recently observed unconventional ferroelectricity in AB bilayer graphene
sandwiched by hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) presents a new platform to
manipulate correlated phases in multilayered van der Waals heterostructures. We
present a low-energy continuum model for AB bilayer graphene encapsulated by
the top and bottom layers of either hBN or graphene, with two independent twist
angles. For the graphene/hBN heterostructures, we show that twist angle
asymmetry leads to a layer polarization of the valence and conduction bands. We
also show that an out-of-plane displacement field not only tunes the layer
polarization but also flattens the low-energy bands. We extend the model to
show that the electronic structures of quadrilayer graphene heterostructure
consisting of AB bilayer graphene encapsulated by the top and bottom graphene
layers can similarly be tuned by an external electric field.

Multi-component molecular machines are ubiquitous in biology. We review
recent progress on describing their thermodynamic properties using autonomous
bipartite Markovian dynamics. The first and second laws can be split into local
versions applicable to each subsystem of a two-component system, illustrating
that one can not only resolve energy flows between the subsystems but also
information flows quantifying how each subsystem's dynamics influence the joint
system's entropy balance. Applying the framework to molecular-scale sensors
allows one to derive tighter bounds on their energy requirement. Two-component
strongly coupled machines can be studied from a unifying perspective
quantifying to what extent they operate conventionally by transducing power or
like an information engine by generating information flow to rectify thermal
fluctuations into output power.

<br>
Despite the exciting implications of the Kitaev spin-Hamiltonian, finding and
confirming the quantum spin liquid state has proven incredibly difficult.
Recently the applicability of the model has been expanded through the
development of a microscopic description of a spin-1 Kitaev interaction. Here
we explore a candidate spin-1 honeycomb system, KNiAsO$_4$ , which meets many
of the proposed criteria to generate such an interaction. Bulk measurements
reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at $\sim$ 19 K which is generally robust
to applied magnetic fields. Neutron diffraction measurements show magnetic
order with a $\textbf{k}=(\frac{3}{2},0,0)$ ordering vector which results in
the well-known ``zig-zag" magnetic structure thought to be adjacent to the
spin-liquid ground state. Field dependent diffraction shows that while the
structure is robust, the field can tune the direction of the ordered moment.
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments show a well defined gapped spin-wave
spectrum with no evidence of the continuum expected for fractionalized
excitations. Modeling of the spin waves shows that the extended Kitaev
spin-Hamiltonians is generally necessary to model the spectra and reproduce the
observed magnetic order. First principles calculations suggest that the
substitution of Pd on the Ni sublattice may strengthen the Kitaev interactions
while simultaneously weakening the exchange interactions thus pushing
KNiAsO$_4$ closer to the spin-liquid ground state.

<br>
The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice
with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. We show that a
tight-binding model with metal and ligand sites on this lattice yields five
flat topological bands (FTBs), three of which are partially occupied at
half-filling, with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range
hopping induces curvature in the FTBs but leaves them flatter and more isolated
than those in twisted bilayer graphene. Thus, framework materials are ideal
materials for exploring flat band physics at high electronic densities.

<br>
Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, we study screening-induced
phase transitions in core-shell ferroic nanoparticles for three different
shapes: an oblate disk, a sphere, and a prolate needle. The nanoparticle is
made of a ferroic CuInP2S6 core and covered by a "tunable" screening shell made
of a phase-change material with a conductivity that varies as the material
changes between semiconductor and metallic phases. We reveal a critical
influence of the shell screening length on the phase transitions and
spontaneous polarization of the nanoparticle core. Since the tunable screening
shell allows the control of the polar state and phase diagrams of core-shell
ferroic nanoparticles, the obtained results can be of particular interest for
applications in nonvolatile memory cells.

<br>
Magnetic defects play an important, but poorly understood, role in magnetic
topological insulators (TIs). For example, topological surface transport and
bulk magnetic properties are controlled by magnetic defects in
Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based dilute ferromagnetic (FM) TIs and MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT)-based
antiferromagnetic (AFM) TIs. Despite its nascent ferromagnetism, our inelastic
neutron scattering data show that a fraction of the Mn defects in Sb$_2$Te$_3$
form strong AFM dimer singlets within a quintuple block. The AFM superexchange
coupling occurs via Mn-Te-Mn linear bonds and is identical to the AFM coupling
between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common
interactions in the two materials classes. We also find that the FM
correlations in (Sb$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ are likely driven by magnetic
defects in adjacent quintuple blocks across the van der Waals gap. In addition
to providing answers to long-standing questions about the evolution of FM order
in dilute TI, these results also show that the evolution of global magnetic
order from AFM to FM in Sb-substituted MBT is controlled by defect engineering
of the intrablock and interblock coupling.

Moir\'e superlattices in twisted two-dimensional materials have generated
tremendous excitement as a platform for achieving quantum properties on demand.
However, the moir\'e pattern is highly sensitive to the interlayer atomic
registry, and current assembly techniques suffer from imprecise control of the
average twist angle, spatial inhomogeneity in the local twist angle, and
distortions due to random strain. Here, we demonstrate a new way to manipulate
the moir\'e patterns in hetero- and homo-bilayers through in-plane bending of
monolayer ribbons, using the tip of an atomic force microscope. This technique
achieves continuous variation of twist angles with improved twist-angle
homogeneity and reduced random strain, resulting in moir\'e patterns with
highly tunable wavelength and ultra-low disorder. Our results pave the way for
detailed studies of ultra-low disorder moir\'e systems and the realization of
precise strain-engineered devices.

We elaborate that for topological insulators and topological superconductors
described by Dirac models in any dimension and symmetry class, the topological
order can be mapped to lattice sites by a universal topological marker.
Deriving from a recently discovered momentum-space universal topological
invariant, we introduce a topological operator that consists of alternating
projectors to filled and empty lattice eigenstates and the position operators,
multiplied by the Dirac matrices that are omitted in the Hamiltonian. The
topological operator projected to lattice sites yields the topological marker,
whose form is explicitly constructed for every topologically nontrivial
symmetry class from 1D to 3D. The off-diagonal elements of the topological
operator yields a nonlocal topological marker, which decays with a correlation
length that diverges at topological phase transitions, and represents a Wannier
state correlation function. Various prototype examples, including
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, Majorana chain, Chern insulators,
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, 2D chiral and helical $p$-wave superconductors,
lattice model of $^{3}$He B-phase, and 3D time-reversal symmetric topological
insulators, etc, are employed to demonstrate the ubiquity of our formalism.

Solar thermochemical hydrogen generation (STCH) is a promising approach for
eco-friendly H2 production, but conventional STCH redox compounds often suffer
from thermodynamic and kinetic limitations with limited tunability. Expanding
from the nascent high-entropy ceramics field, this study explores a new class
of compositionally complex perovskite oxides
(La0.8Sr0.2)(Mn(1-x)/3Fe(1-x)/3CoxAl(1-x)/3)O3 for STCH. In situ X-ray
diffraction demonstrates the phase stability during redox cycling and in situ
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows preferential redox of Co. The extent of
reduction increases, but the intrinsic kinetics decreases, with increased Co
content. Consequently, (La0.8Sr0.2)(Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.4Al0.2)O3-{\delta} achieves
an optimal balance between the thermodynamics and kinetics properties. The
combination of a moderate enthalpy of reduction, high entropy of reduction, and
preferable surface oxygen exchange kinetics enables a maximum H2 yield of 395
+- 11 {\mu}mol g-1 in a short 1-hour redox duration. Entropy stabilization
expectedly contributes to the structure stability during redox without phase
transformation, which enables an exceptional STCH stability for >50 cycles
under harsh interrupted conditions. The underlying redox mechanism is further
elucidated by the density functional theory based parallel Monte Carlo
computation, which represents a new computation paradigm first established
here. This study suggests a new class of non-equimolar compositionally complex
ceramics for STCH and chemical looping.

The quantum dimer and loop models attract great attentions, partially because
the fundamental importance in the novel phases and phase transitions emerging
in these prototypical constrained lattice models; and partially due to their
intimate relevance towards the on-going experiments on Rydberg atom arrays in
which the blockade mechanism naturally enforces the local constraint. Here we
show, by means of the sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo method, the complete
ground state phase diagram of the fully packed quantum loop model on the square
lattice. We find between the lattice nematic (LN) phase with strong dimer
attraction and the staggered phase (SP) with strong dimer repulsion, there
emerges a resonating plaquette (RP) phase with off-diagonal translational
symmetry breaking. Such a novel phase is separated from the LN via a first
order transition and from the SP by the famous Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our
renormalization group analysis reveals the different flow directions towards
different symmetry breaking phases, fully consistent with the order parameter
histogram in Monte Carlo simulations. The realization of our phase diagram in
Rydberg exmperiments is proposed.

<i>Fan Zheng, Lin-wang Wang</i>
<br>
With the rapid development of ultra-fast experimental techniques used for
carrier dynamics in solid-state systems, a microscopic understanding of the
related phenomena, particularly a first-principle calculation is highly
desirable. Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) offers a real-time direct
simulation of the carrier transfer or carrier thermalization. However, when
applied to a periodic supercell, due to the $\Gamma$-point phonon movement
during the molecular dynamics, there is no supercell electronic $k$-point
crossing during the NAMD simulation. This often leads to a significant
underestimation of the transition rate due to significant energy gaps in the
single supercell $k$-point band structure. In this work, based on the surface
hopping scheme used for NAMD, we propose a practical method to enable the
cross-$k$ transition for a periodic system. We demonstrate our formalism by
showing that the hot electron thermalization process by the multi $k$-point
NAMD in a small supercell is equivalent to such simulation in a large supercell
with single $\Gamma$ $k$-point. The hot carrier thermalization process in the
bulk silicon is also carried out and compared with the recent ultra-fast
experiments with excellent agreements.

<br>
Monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$ (FeSe/STO) is an interfacial high
temperature superconductor distinctively different from bulk FeSe. Due to the
fragility of this two-dimensional system in the atmosphere, the investigation
of its intrinsic superconductivity and intertwined orders has largely been
limited to surface-sensitive charge probes compatible with ultra-high vacuum
environment. However, the superconducting phase coherence of the interface is
challenging to probe. Here, we perform in-situ mutual inductance in ultra-high
vacuum on FeSe/STO in combination with band mapping by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that even though the monolayer
showed a gap-closing temperature above 50 K, surprisingly no diamagnetism is
visible down to 5 K. This is the case for few-layer FeSe/STO until it exceeds a
critical number of 5 layers where diamagnetism suddenly appears. But the
superfluid density does not saturate down to the base temperature in these
thick samples. On the other hand, the suppression of diamagnetism in the
few-layer FeSe/STO can be lifted by depositing a FeTe layer on top. The
superconducting transition is much sharper than that in the thick FeSe/STO.
However, Tc and superfluid density both decrease with increasing FeTe
thickness. Shining ultraviolet light on the FeTe/FeSe/STO heterostructure
enhances Tc similarly independent of the FeSe thickness, showing that the
diamagnetism originates at the FeSe/STO interface. Our observation may be
understood by a scenario in which interfacial superconducting phase coherence
is highly anisotropic.

Chiral zeroth Landau levels are topologically protected bulk states that give
rise to chiral anomaly. Previous discussions on such chiral Landau levels are
based on three-dimensional Weyl degeneracies. Their realizations using
two-dimensional Dirac point systems, being more promising for future
applications, were never reported before. Here we propose a theoretical and
experimental scheme for realizing chiral Landau levels in a photonic system. By
introducing an inhomogeneous effective mass through breaking local parity
inversion symmetries, the zeroth-order chiral Landau levels with one-way
propagation characteristics are experimentally observed. In addition, the
robust transport of the chiral zeroth mode against defects in the system is
experimentally tested. Our system provides a new pathway for the realization of
chiral Landau levels in two-dimensional Dirac systems, and may potentially be
applied in device designs utilizing the transport robustness.

layer thickness, stacking patterns and magnetism in these materials, from a
microscopic point of view, is still lacking. In this work, we have used Density
Functional Theory (DFT) based calculations to understand the effects of layer
thickness and stacking on the magnetic properties in two magnetic MXenes,
Ti$_{2}$C and Fe$_{2}$C in their monolayer and bilayer forms. The ground state
magnetic structures, magnetic moments, magnetic exchange interactions, magnetic
transition temperatures and magnetic anisotropy energies are calculated and
analysed using their electronic structures and standardised models. We find
that in both systems increase in layer thickness (monolayer to bilayer) affects
the ground state magnetic configuration which is driven by the changes in the
magnetic exchange interactions. While the effects of stacking pattern is rather
weak in Ti$_{2}$C, they are substantial, both qualitatively and quantitatively
in Fe$_{2}$C. The computed results are analysed from their electronic
structures. The results suggest that fascinating physical effects can be
obtained in Fe$_{2}$C by tuning the layer thickness and stacking patterns,
making it more suitable for device applications.

Recent experiments on vanadium-based nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) revealed evidence for possible spontaneous
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the charge density wave (CDW) ordered
state. The long-sought-after quantum order of loop currents has been suggested
as a candidate for the TRS breaking state. However, a microscopic model for the
emergence of the loop-current CDW due to electronic correlations is still
lacking. Here, we calculate the susceptibility of the real and imaginary bond
orders on the kagom\'e lattice near van Hove filling, and reveal the importance
of next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_2$ in triggering the instability
toward imaginary bond ordered CDW. The concrete effective single-orbital
$t$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice is then studied, where $t$ and
$V_1$ are the hopping and Coulomb repulsion on the nearest-neighbor bonds. We
obtain the mean-field ground states, analyze their properties, and determine
the phase diagram in the plane spanned by $V_1$ and $V_2$ at van Hove filling.
The region dominated by $V_1$ is occupied by a $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ real CDW
insulator with the inverse of Star-of-David (ISD) bond configuration.
Increasing $V_2$ indeed drives a first-order transition from the ISD to
stabilized loop-current insulators that exhibit four possible current patterns
of different topological properties, leading to orbital Chern insulators. We
then extend these results away from van Hove filling and show that the
loop-current states survive in the lightly doped orbital Chern insulators, and
give rise to emergent Chern Fermi pockets carrying large Berry curvature and
orbit magnetic moment. Our findings provide a concrete model realization of the
loop-current Chern metal at the mean-field level for the TRS breaking normal
state of the kagom\'e superconductors.

<h3>Ferroelectricity-driven phonon Berry curvature and non-linear phonon  Hall transports</h3>

Berry curvature (BC) governs topological phases of matter and generates
anomalous transport. When a magnetic field is applied, phonons can acquire BC
indirectly through spin-lattice coupling, leading to a linear phonon Hall
effect. Here, we show that polar lattice distortion directly couples to a
phonon BC dipole, which causes a switchable non-linear phonon Hall effect. In a
SnS monolayer, the in-plane ferroelectricity induces a phonon BC and leads to
the phononic version of the non-volatile BC memory effect. As a new type of
ferroelectricity-phonon coupling, the phonon Rashba effect emerges and opens a
mass-gap in tilted Weyl phonon modes, resulting in a large phonon BC dipole.
Furthermore, our ab initio non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
reveal that non-linear phonon Hall transport occurs in a controllable manner
via ferroelectric switching. The ferroelectricity-driven phonon BC and
corresponding non-linear phonon transports provide a novel scheme for
constructing topological phononic transport/memory devices.

We describe an approach based on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)
simulations to calculate the ionic mobility of solid ion conductors such as
solid electrolytes from first-principles. The calculations are carried out in
finite slabs of the material, where an electric field is applied and the
dynamic response of the mobile ions is measured. We compare our results with
those obtained from diffusion calculations, under the non-interacting ion
approximation, and with experiment. This method is shown to provide good
quantitative estimates for the ionic mobilities of two silver conductors,
$\alpha$-AgI and $\alpha$-RbAg$_4$I$_5$. In addition to being convenient and
numerically robust, this method accounts for ion-ion correlations at a much
lower computational cost than exact approaches.

<h3>Clusters in the critical branching Brownian motion</h3>

Brownian particles that are replicated and annihilated at equal rate have
strongly correlated positions, forming a few compact clusters separated by
large gaps. We characterize the distribution of the particles at a given time,
using a definition of clusters in terms a coarse-graining length recently
introduced by some of us. We show that, in a non-extinct realization, the
average number of clusters grows as $\sim t^{D_{\mathrm{f}}/2}$ where
$D_{\mathrm{f}} \approx 0.22$ is the Haussdoff dimension of the boundary of the
super-Brownian motion, found by Mueller, Mytnik, and Perkins. We also compute
the distribution of gaps between consecutive particles. We find two regimes
separated by the characteristic length scale $\ell = \sqrt{D/\beta}$ where $D$
is the diffusion constant and $\beta$ the branching rate. The average number of
gaps greater than $g$ decays as $\sim g^{D_{\mathrm{f}}-2}$ for $g\ll \ell$ and
$\sim g^{-D_{\mathrm{f}}}$ for $g \gg \ell$. Finally, conditioned on the number
of particles $n$, the above distributions are valid for $g \ll \sqrt{n}$; the
average number of gaps greater than $g \gg \sqrt{n}$ is much less than one, and
decays as $\simeq 4 (g/\sqrt{n})^{-2}$, in agreement with the universal gap
distribution predicted by Ramola, Majumdar, and Schehr. Our results interpolate
between a dense super-Brownian motion regime and a large-gap regime, unifying
two previously independent approaches.

<br>
We present a simple and systematic procedure to determine the effective
dynamics of a Brownian particle coupled to a rapidly fluctuating correlated
medium, modeled as a scalar Gaussian field, under spatial confinement. The
method allows us, in particular, to address the case in which the fluctuations
of the medium are suppressed in the vicinity of the particle, as described by a
quadratic coupling in the underlying Hamiltonian. As a consequence of the
confinement of the correlated medium, the resulting effective Fokker-Planck
equation features spatially dependent drift and diffusion coefficients. We
apply our method to simplified fluid models of binary mixtures and
microemulsions near criticality containing a colloidal particle, and we analyze
the corrections to the stationary distribution of the particle position and the
diffusion coefficient.

<h3>Enhancement of charge-neutral fermionic excitation near spin-flop  transition\\ in magnetic Kondo material YbIr$_3$Si$_7$</h3>

<br>
The new Kondo material YbIr$_3$Si$_7$, similar to other Kondo insulators, has
been reported to exhibit charge-neutral fermionic excitations through
measurements of specific heat and thermal conductivity at low temperatures. We
performed $^{29}$Si-NMR on YbIr$_3$Si$_7$ to investigate the magnetic response
of charge-neutral fermions from a microscopic perspective. In low magnetic
fields parallel to the $c$ axis, a single NMR peak in the paramagnetic state
splits into three peaks below $T_{\rm N}$. In contrast, only a slight shift of
the single NMR peak was observed in high magnetic fields. This spectral change
as a function of the $c$-axis magnetic field is interpreted as spin-flop
transition, at which the magnetic moments oriented along the $c$ axis (AF-I
phase) are rotated to the $ab$ plane with ferromagnetic component along the
$c$-axis (AF-II phase). In the vicinity of the spin-flop magnetic field $H_{\rm
M}$, nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ was found to be proportional
to temperature at low temperatures, indicating the existence of charge-neutral
fermions. Furthermore, a peak of $1/T_1$ vs. the $c$-axis magnetic field
suggests that the charge-neutral fermions in YbIr$_3$Si$_7$ are closely related
to its magnetic properties. Our findings shed light on the origin of
charge-neutral fermions in insulators.

<br>
Barkhausen noise in disordered ferromagnets is typically understood to
originate primarily from jerky field-driven motion of domain walls. We study
the magnetization reversal process in disordered permalloy thin films using
micromagnetic simulations, and find that the magnetization reversal process
consists of the gradual formation of immobile 360$^{\circ}$ domain walls via a
sequence of localized magnetization rotation events. The density of
360$^{\circ}$ domain walls formed within the sample as well as the statistical
properties of the Barkhausen jumps are controlled by the disorder strength.

<h3>Detection of a Pair Density Wave State in UTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
Although UTe$_2$ is a very promising candidate material to embody bulk
topological superconductivity, its superconductive order-parameter
$\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ remains unknown. Many diverse forms for
$\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ are physically possible because, in uranium-based heavy
fermion materials, strongly hybridized flat bands of composite fermions
generate highly complex interactions. Moreover, in such materials intertwined
density waves of spin (SDW), charge (CDW) and pairs (PDW) may interpose, with
the latter state exhibiting spatially modulating superconductive
order-parameter $\Delta(\mathbf{r})$, electron pair density and pairing
energy-gap. Hence, the newly discovered CDW state in UTe$_2$ motivates the
exciting prospect that a PDW state may exist in this material. To search for a
PDW in UTe$_2$, we visualize the pairing energy-gap with $\mu$$V$-scale
energy-resolution made possible by superconductive STM tips at subkelvin
temperatures. We detect three PDWs, each with peak-peak gap modulations circa
10 $\mu$$eV$ and at incommensurate wavevectors $\mathbf{P}_{i=1,2,3}$ that are
indistinguishable from the wavevectors $\mathbf{Q}_{i=1,2,3}$ of the prevenient
CDW. Concurrent visualization of the UTe$_2$ superconductive PDWs and the
non-superconductive CDWs reveals that every $\mathbf{P}_i$ : $\mathbf{Q}_i$
pair is registered to each other spatially, but with a relative phase
$\delta\phi \approx \pi$. From these observations, and given UTe$_2$ as a
spin-triplet superconductor, the PDW state detected here should be a
spin-triplet pair density wave. While such states do exist in superfluid
$^{3}$He, for superconductors they are unprecedented.

<h3>Fingerprints of carbon defects in vibrational spectra of gallium nitride  (GaN) consider-ing the isotope effect</h3>

<br>
<i>I. Gamov, J.L. Lyons, G. Gärtner, K. Irmscher, E. Richter, M. Weyers, M.R. Wagner, M. Bickermann</i>
<br>
This work examines the carbon defects associated with recently reported and
novel peaks of infrared (IR) absorption and Raman scattering appearing in GaN
crystals at carbon ($^{12}C$) doping in the range of concentrations from
$3.2*10^{17}$ to $3.5*10^{19} cm^{-3}$. 14 unique vibrational modes of defects
are observed in GaN samples grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) and
then compared with defect properties predicted from first-principles
calculations. The vibrational frequency shift in two $^{13}C$ enriched samples
related to the effect of the isotope mass indicates six distinct configurations
of the carbon-containing point defects. The effect of the isotope replacement
is well reproduced by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Specific attention is paid to the most pronounced defects, namely tri-carbon
complexes($C_N=C=C_N$) and carbon substituting for nitrogen $C_N$. The position
of the transition level (+/0) in the bandgap found for $C_N=C=C_N$ defects by
DFT at 1.1 eV above the valence band maximum, suggest that $(C_N=C=C_N)^+$
provides compensation of ${C_N}^-$. $C_N=C=C_N$ defects are observed to be
prominent, yet have high formation energies in DFT calculations. Regarding
${C_N}$ defects, it is shown that the host Ga and N atoms are involved in the
defect's delocalized vibrations and significantly affect the isotopic frequency
shift. Much more faint vibrational modes are found from di-atomic carbon-carbon
and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) complexes. Also, we note changes of vibrational mode
intensities of $C_N$, $C_N=C=C_N$, C-H, and $C_N-C_i$ defects in the IR
absorption spectra upon irradiation in the defect-related UV/visible absorption
range. Finally, it is demonstrated that the resonant enhancement of the Raman
process in the range of defect absorption above 2.5 eV enables the detection of
defects at carbon doping concentrations as low as $3.2*10^{17} cm^{-3}$.

<h3>Theory of the Loschmidt echo and dynamical quantum phase transitions in  disordered Fermi systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Tuomas I. Vanhala, Teemu Ojanen</i>
<br>
In this work we develop the theory of the Loschmidt echo and dynamical phase
transitions in non-interacting strongly disordered Fermi systems after a
quench. In finite systems the Loschmidt echo displays zeros in the complex time
plane that depend on the random potential realization. Remarkably, the zeros
coalesce to form a 2D manifold in the thermodynamic limit, atypical for 1D
systems, crossing the real axis at a sharply-defined critical time. We show
that this dynamical phase transition can be understood as a transition in the
distribution function of the smallest eigenvalue of the Loschmidt matrix, and
develop a finite-size scaling theory. Contrary to expectations, the notion of
dynamical phase transitions in disordered systems becomes decoupled from the
equilibrium Anderson localization transition. Our results highlight the
striking qualitative differences of quench dynamics in disordered and
non-disordered many-fermion systems.

<br>
Single-crystal elastic moduli, Cij, and the B1-B2 phase transition of NaCl
were investigated experimentally, using time-domain Brillouin scattering
(TDBS), and theoretically, via density-functional-theory (DFT), to 41 GPa.
Thus, we largely extended pressure range where Cij and elastic anisotropy of
the solid are measured, including the first experimental data for the
high-pressure B2 phase, NaCl-B2. NaCl-B1 exhibits a strong and growing with
pressure anisotropy, in contrast to NaCl-B2. Theoretical values obtained using
different advanced DFT functionals were compared with our measurements but no
one could satisfactorily reproduce our experimental data for NaCl-B1 and
NaCl-B2 simultaneously. For all available DFT results on the principal shear
moduli and anisotropy, the deviation became pronounced when the degree of
compression increased significantly. Similar deviations could be also
recognized for other cubic solids having the same B1-type structure and similar
bonding, such as CaO, MgO, or (Mg1-x,Fex)O. Furthermore, the available
experimental data suggest that the B1-B2 phase transition of NaCl and the above
mentioned compounds are governed by the Born stability criterion C44(P) - P >
0.

<h3>Higher order topology in a Creutz ladder</h3>

<i>Srijata Lahiri, Saurabh Basu</i>
<br>
A Creutz ladder, is a quasi one dimensional system hosting robust topological
phases with localized edge modes protected by different symmetries such as
inversion, chiral and particle-hole symmetries. Non-trivial topology is
observed in a large region of the parameter space defined by the horizontal,
diagonal and vertical hopping ampitudes and a transverse magnetic flux that
threads through the ladder. In this work, we investigate higher order topology
in a two dimensional extrapolated version of the Creutz ladder. To explore the
topological phases, we consider two different configurations, namely a torus
(periodic boundary) and a ribbon (open boundary) to look for hints of gap
closing phase transitions. We also associate suitable topological invariants to
characterize the non-trivial sectors. Further, we find that the resultant phase
diagram hosts two different topological phases, one where the higher order
topological excitations are realized in the form of robust corner modes, along
with (usual) first order excitations demonstrated via the presence of edge
modes in a finite lattice, for the other.

<br>
Broadband ferromagnetic resonance is measured in single crystalline Fe films
of varying thickness sandwiched between MgO layers. An exhaustive magnetic
characterization of the films (exchange constant, cubic, uniaxial and surface
anisotropies) is enabled by the study of the uniform and the first
perpendicular standing spin wave modes as a function of applied magnetic field
and film thickness. Additional measurements of non-reciprocal spin wave
propagation allow us to separate each of the two interface contributions to the
total surface anisotropy. The results are consistent with the model of a
quasi-bulk film interior and two magnetically different top and bottom
interfaces, a difference ascribed to different oxidation states.

<br>
The criticality of the jamming transition responsible for amorphous
solidification has been theoretically linked to the marginal stability of a
thermodynamic Gardner phase. While the critical exponents of jamming appear
independent of the preparation history, the pertinence of Gardner physics far
from equilibrium is an open question. To fill this gap, we numerically study
the nonequilibrium dynamics of hard disks compressed towards the jamming
transition using a broad variety of protocols. We show that dynamic signatures
of Gardner physics can be disentangled from the aging relaxation dynamics. We
thus define a generic dynamic Gardner crossover regardless of the history. Our
results show that the jamming transition is always accessed by exploring
increasingly complex landscape, resulting in the anomalous microscopic
relaxation dynamics that remains to be understood theoretically.

<br>
We study an air-fluidized granular monolayer, composed in this case of
plastic spheres, which roll on a metallic grid. The air current is adjusted so
that the spheres never loose contact with the grid, so that the dynamics may be
regarded as pseudo two-dimensional (or two-dimensional, if the effects of
sphere rolling are not taken into account). We find two surprising continuous
transitions, both of them displaying two coexisting phases. Moreover, in all
cases, we found the coexisting phases display strong energy non-equipartition.
In the first transition, at weak fludization, a glassy phase coexists with a
disordered fluid-like phase. In the second transition, a hexagonal crystal
coexists with the fluid phase. We analyze, for these two-phase systems, the
specific diffusive properties of each phase, as well as the velocity
correlations. Surprisingly, we find a glass phase at very low packing fraction
and for a wide range of granular temperatures. Both phases are characterized
also by a strong anti-correlated velocities upon collision. Thus, the dynamics
observed for this quasi two-dimensional system unveils phase transitions with
peculiar properties, very different from the predicted behavior in well know
theories for their equilibrium counterparts.

<h3>Enhanced robustness and dimensional crossover of superradiance in  cuboidal nanocrystal superlattices</h3>

<br>
Cooperative emission of coherent radiation from multiple emitters (known as
superradiance) has been predicted and observed in various physical systems,
most recently in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal superlattices. Superradiant emission is
coherent and occurs on timescales faster than the emission from isolated
nanocrystals. Theory predicts cooperative emission being faster by a factor of
up to the number of nanocrystals ($N$). However, superradiance is strongly
suppressed due to the presence of energetic disorder, stemming from nanocrystal
size variations and thermal decoherence. Here, we analyze superradiance from
superlattices of different dimensionalities (1D, 2D and 3D) with variable
nanocrystal aspect ratios. We predict as much as a thirty-fold enhancement in
robustness against realistic values of energetic disorder in three-dimensional
(3D) superlattices composed of cuboid-shaped, as opposed to cube-shaped,
nanocrystals. Superradiance from small $(N\lesssim 10^3)$ two-dimensional (2D)
superlattices is up to 10 times more robust to static disorder and up to twice
as robust to thermal decoherence than three-dimensional (3D) superlattices with
the same $N$. As the number of $N$ increases, a crossover in the robustness of
superradiance occurs from 2D to 3D superlattices. For large $N\ (> 10^3)$, the
robustness in 3D superlattices increases with $N$, showing cooperative
robustness to disorder. This opens the possibility of observing superradiance
even at room temperature in large 3D superlattices, if nanocrystal size
fluctuations can be kept small.

Electric control of spins has been a longstanding goal in the field of solid
state physics due to the potential for increased efficiency in information
processing. This efficiency can be optimized by transferring spintronics to the
atomic scale. We present electric control of spin resonance transitions in
single molecules by employing electron spin resonance scanning tunneling
microscopy (ESR-STM). We find strong bias voltage dependent shifts in the ESR
signal of about ten times its linewidth, which is due to the electric field
induced displacement of the spin system in the tunnel junction. This opens up
new avenues for ultrafast control of coupled spin systems, even towards atomic
scale quantum computing, and expands on understanding and optimizing spin
electric coupling in bulk materials.

<br>
Pt catalyst particles on reducible oxide supports often change their activity
significantly at elevated temperatures due to the strong metal-support
interaction (SMSI), which induces the formation of an encapsulation layer
around the noble metal particles. However, the impact of oxidizing and reducing
treatments at elevated pressures on this encapsulation layer remains
controversial, partly due to the 'pressure gap' between surface science studies
and applied catalysis. In the present work, we employ synchrotron-based
near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) to study the
effect of O$_2$ and H$_2$ on the SMSI-state of well-defined Pt/TiO$_2$(110)
catalysts at pressures of up to 0.1 Torr. By tuning the O$_2$ pressure, we can
either selectively oxidize the TiO$_2$ support or both the support and the Pt
particles. Catalyzed by metallic Pt, the encapsulating oxide overlayer grows
rapidly in 1x10$^{-5}$ Torr O$_2$, but orders of magnitudes less effective at
higher O$_2$ pressures, where Pt is in an oxidic state. While the
oxidation/reduction of Pt particles is reversible, they remain embedded in the
support once encapsulation has occurred.

Modification of optical phonon spectra in contacting nanoparticles as
compared to the single ones is studied. Optical phonons in dielectric and
semiconducting particles obey the Euclidean metric Klein-Fock-Gordon equation
with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The latter is supposed to be solved
numerically for manifolds of interpenetrating spheres. It is proposed to
replace this problem with the simpler-to-solve coupled oscillators model (COM),
where an oscillator is attributed to each phonon mode of a particle and the
particles overlap leads to appearance of additional couplings for these
oscillators with the magnitude proportional to the overlapped volume. For not
too big overlaps this model describes solutions of the original eigenvalue
problem on a good level of accuracy. In particular, it works beyond isotropic s
modes, which has been demonstrated for p modes in dimer and also for tetramer.
It is proposed to apply COM for the description of recently manufactured dimer
nanoparticles and quantum dots. The obtained results are in agreement with the
dynamical matrix method for optical phonons in nanodiamonds. The latter is used
to demonstrate that the van der Waals contacts between faceted particles lead
to very small modifications of the optical phonon spectra, which therefore
could be neglected when discussing the propagation of vibrational excitations
via a nanopowder. The possibility to distinguish between dimerized and
size-distributed single particles from their Raman spectra is also considered.

We present a numerical method to produce stochastic dynamics according to the
generalized Langevin equation with a non-stationary memory kernel. This type of
dynamics occurs when a microscopic system with an explicitly time-dependent
Liouvillian is coarse-grained by means of a projection operator formalism. We
show how to replace the deterministic fluctuating force in the generalized
Langevin equation by a stochastic process, such that the distributions of the
observables are reproduced up to moments of a given order. Thus, in combination
with a method to extract the memory kernel from simulation data of the
underlying microscopic model, the method introduced here allows to construct
and simulate a coarse-grained model for a driven process.

<br>
The idea that a thermodynamic glass transition of some sort underlies the
observed glass formation has been highly debated since Kauzmann first stressed
the hypothetical entropy crisis that could take place if one were able to
equilibrate supercooled liquids below the experimental glass transition
temperature $T_g$. This a priori unreachable transition at some $T_K<T_g$ has
since received a firm theoretical basis as a key feature predicted by the
mean-field theory of the glass transition. In this chapter, we assess whether,
and in which form, such a transition can survive in finite dimensions, and we
review some of the recent computer simulation work addressing the issue in $2$-
and $3$-dimensional glass-forming liquid models. We also discuss theoretical
reasons to focus on an apparently inaccessible singularity.

Single atoms provide an ideal system for utilizing fundamental quantum
functions. Their electrons have well-defined energy levels and spin properties.
Even more importantly, for a given isotope -- say, $^{12}$C -- all the atoms
are identical. This creates a perfect uniformity that is impossible to achieve
in macroscopic-size quantum systems. However, herding individual atoms is a
very difficult task that requires trapping them with magnetic or optical means
and cooling them down to temperatures in the nanokelvin range. On the other
hand, the counterpart of single atoms -- the single defects -- may be as good
as atom-based quantum systems if not better. These defects, also referred as
quantum defects, possess the favorable energy, spin, and uniformity properties
of single atoms and remain in their place without the help of precisely tuned
lasers. While the number of usable isotopes is set, the combinations of defects
and their host material are practically limitless, giving us the flexibility to
create precisely designed and controlled quantum systems. Furthermore, as we
tame these defects for the quantum world, we bring about transformative
opportunities to the classical world in forms such as ultradense electronic
devices and precise manufacturing. In this research insight, we introduce some
of our recent work on precisely controlled creation and manipulation of
individual defects with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We also discuss
possible pathways for utilizing these capabilities for the development of novel
systems for Quantum Information Science (QIS) applications such as quantum
information processing and ultrasensitive sensors.

<br>
Bogoliubov quasiparticles are coherent electron-hole quantum superposition
which typically, for time-reversal symmetric superconductors, exhibit a
spectral distribution with particle-hole symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in
two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors with inter-orbital $s$-wave
spin-triplet pairing the energy profile of the density of states at the edge
violates this paradigm. We unveil the spin-orbital structure of multiple
Andreev reflections and how these processes lead to anomalous septet pairing
states built out of mirror symmetric quasiparticles, a configuration that is
symmetry prohibited in the bulk. The resulting edge-bulk pairing mismatch is
the origin of the asymmetric peaks for the spectral function. Remarkably, the
distribution of the asymmetric line shape can be controlled by designing the
spatial profile of the inversion symmetry breaking interaction. These findings
can qualitatively account for the phenomena observed at the surface of the
UTe$_2$ superconductor and be exploited to single out the nature of pairing at
oxide interface superconductors.

<h3>Chiral Majorana Modes via Proximity to a Twisted Cuprate Bilayer</h3>

<br>
<i>Gilad Margalit, Binghai Yan, Marcel Franz, Yuval Oreg</i>
<br>
We propose a novel heterostructure to achieve chiral topological
superconductivity in 2D. A substrate with a large Rashba spin-orbit coupling
energy is brought in proximity to a twisted bilayer of thin films exfoliated
from a high-temperature cuprate superconductor. The combined system is then
exposed to an out-of-plane magnetic field. The rare $d + id$ pairing symmetry
expected to occur in such a system allows for nontrivial topology;
specifically, in contrast to the case of the twisted bilayer in isolation, the
substrate induces an odd Chern number. The resulting phase is characterized by
the presence of a Majorana zero mode in each vortex.

<h3>Field-tunable Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless correlations in a  Heisenberg magnet</h3>

<br>
We report the manifestation of field-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) correlations in the weakly coupled spin-1/2 Heisenberg layers of the
molecular-based bulk material [Cu(pz)$_2$(2-HOpy)$_2$](PF$_6$)$_2$. Due to the
moderate intralayer exchange coupling of $J/k_\mathrm{B} = 6.8$ K, the
application of laboratory magnetic fields induces a substantial $XY$ anisotropy
of the spin correlations. Crucially, this provides a significant BKT regime, as
the tiny interlayer exchange $J^\prime / k_\mathrm{B} \approx 1$ mK only
induces 3D correlations upon close approach to the BKT transition with its
exponential growth in the spin-correlation length. We employ nuclear magnetic
resonance and $\mu^{+}$SR measurements to probe the spin correlations that
determine the critical temperatures of the BKT transition as well as that of
the onset of long-range order. Further, we perform stochastic series expansion
quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the experimentally determined model
parameters. Finite-size scaling of the in-plane spin stiffness yields excellent
agreement of critical temperatures between theory and experiment, providing
clear evidence that the nonmonotonic magnetic phase diagram of
[Cu(pz)$_2$(2-HOpy)$_2$](PF$_6$)$_2$ is determined by the field-tuned $XY$
anisotropy and the concomitant BKT physics.

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) Transition Metal Dichalcogenide semiconductor (TMDs)
nanocircuits are deterministically engineered over large-scale substrates. The
original approach combines large-area physical growth of 2D TMDs layer with
high resolution thermal - Scanning Probe Lithography (t-SPL), to reshape the
ultra-thin semiconducting layers at the nanoscale level. We demonstrate the
additive nanofabrication of few-layer MoS2 nanostructures, grown in the
2H-semiconducting TMD phase, as shown by their Raman vibrational fingerprints
and by their optoelectronic response. The electronic signatures of the MoS2
nanostructures are locally identified by Kelvin probe force microscopy
providing chemical and compositional contrast at the nanometer scale. Finally,
the potential role of the 2D TMD nanocircuits as building blocks of
deterministic 2D semiconducting interconnections is demonstrated by
high-resolution local conductivity maps showing the competitive transport
properties of these large-area nanolayers. This work thus provides a powerful
approach to scalable nanofabrication of 2D nano-interconnects and van der Waals
heterostructures, and to their integration in real-world ultra-compact
electronic and photonic nanodevices.

<h3>Training neural network ensembles via trajectory sampling</h3>

<br>
<i>Jamie F. Mair, Dominic C. Rose, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
In machine learning, there is renewed interest in neural network ensembles
(NNEs), whereby predictions are obtained as an aggregate from a diverse set of
smaller models, rather than from a single larger model. Here, we show how to
define and train a NNE using techniques from the study of rare trajectories in
stochastic systems. We define an NNE in terms of the trajectory of the model
parameters under a simple, and discrete in time, diffusive dynamics, and train
the NNE by biasing these trajectories towards a small time-integrated loss, as
controlled by appropriate counting fields which act as hyperparameters. We
demonstrate the viability of this technique on a range of simple supervised
learning tasks. We discuss potential advantages of our trajectory sampling
approach compared with more conventional gradient based methods.

<h3>Anyon condensation, topological quantum information scrambling, and  Andreev-like reflection of non-Abelian anyons in quantum Hall interfaces</h3>

Quantum information scrambling is the spread of local information into
correlation throughout the entire quantum many-body system. This concept has
become a central topic in different contexts. In this work, we restate the
connection between anyon condensation and topological quantum information
scrambling in quantum Hall interfaces. We consider the interface between the
Abelian Halperin-330 state and the non-Abelian Read-Rezayi state. We verify
explicitly that the interface can be fully gapped. This allows the
transmutation of local pseudospin information carried by an Abelian anyon into
topological information stored entirely by the anyons in the non-Abelian
quantum Hall liquid, with no scrambled information stored at the interface. In
combination with our previous work [K. K. W. Ma and K. Yang, Phys. Rev. B 105,
045306 (2022)], our results demonstrate the dependence of the scrambling
mechanism on the gapfulness of the interface. Possible Andreev-like reflection
of non-Abelian anyons in the fully gapped interface is also discussed.

<h3>Logarithmic catastrophes and Stokes's phenomenon in waves at horizons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11148" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11148</a>
<br>
<i>L. M. Farrell, C. J. Howls, D. H. J. O'Dell</i>
<br>
Waves propagating near an event horizon display interesting features
including logarithmic phase singularities and caustics. We consider an acoustic
horizon in a flowing Bose-Einstein condensate where the elementary excitations
obey the Bogoliubov dispersion relation. In the hamiltonian ray theory the
solutions undergo a broken pitchfork bifurcation near the horizon and one might
therefore expect the associated wave structure to be given by a Pearcey
function, this being the universal wave function that dresses catastrophes with
two control parameters. However, the wave function is in fact an Airy-type
function supplemented by a logarithmic phase term, a novel type of wave
catastrophe. Similar wave functions arise in aeroacoustic flows from jet
engines and also gravitational horizons if dispersion which violates Lorentz
symmetry in the UV is included. The approach we take differs from previous
authors in that we analyze the behaviour of the integral representation of the
wave function using exponential coordinates. This allows for a different
treatment of the branches that gives rise to an analysis based purely on
saddlepoint expansions, which resolve the multiple real and complex waves that
interact at the horizon and its companion caustic. We find that the horizon is
a physical manifestation of a Stokes surface, marking the place where a wave is
born, and that the horizon and the caustic do not in general coincide: the
finite spatial region between them delineates a broadened horizon.

<h3>Electrode effects on the observability of destructive quantum  interference in single-molecule junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11151</a>
<br>
<i>O. Sengul, A. Valli, R. Stadler</i>
<br>
Destructive quantum interference (QI) has been a source of interest as a new
paradigm for molecular electronics as the electronic conductance is widely
dependent on the occurrence or absence of destructive QI effects. In order to
interpret experimentally observed transmission features, it is necessary to
understand the effects of all components of the junction on electron transport.
We perform non-equilibrium Green's function calculations within the framework
of density functional theory to assess the structure-function relationship of
transport through pyrene molecular junctions with distinct QI properties. The
chemical nature of the anchor groups and the electrodes controls the Fermi
level alignment, which determines the observability of destructive QI. A
thorough analysis allows to disentangle the transmission features arising from
the molecule and the electrodes. Interestingly, graphene electrodes introduce
features in the low-bias regime, which can either mask or be misinterpreted as
QI effects, while instead originating from the topological properties of the
edges. Thus, this first principles analysis provides clear indications to guide
the interpretation of experimental studies, which cannot be obtained from
simple H\"uckel model calculations.

<h3>Giant electroviscous effects in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11154</a>
<br>
<i>M. Praveen Kumar, Jakub Karcz, Przemyslaw Kula, Smarajit Karmakar, Surajit Dhara</i>
<br>
The electroviscous effect deals with the change in the viscosity of fluids
due to the external electric field. Here, we report experimental studies on the
electroviscous effects in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal. We measure
electric field-dependent viscosity under a steady shear rate at different
temperatures. In the low field range the increase in viscosity ($\Delta\eta$)
is proportional to $E^2$ and the corresponding viscoelectric coefficient ($f$)
is two orders of magnitude larger in ferroelectric nematic than the
conventional apolar nematic liquid crystals. The apparent viscosity measured
under high electric field shows a power-law divergence
$\eta\sim(T-T_c)^{-0.7\pm0.05}$, followed by a drastic decrease below the
$N-N_{F}$ phase transition. Experimental results within the dynamical scaling
approximation demonstrate rapid growth of elongated polar domains under strong
electric field which suppresses the $N-N_{F}$ phase transition temperature
significantly.

<h3>On G-fractional diffusion models in bounded domains</h3>

<i>L. Angelani, R. Garra</i>
<br>
In the recent literature, the g-subdiffusion equation involving Caputo
fractional derivatives with respect to another function has been studied in
relation to anomalous diffusions with a continuous transition between different
subdiffusive regimes. In this paper we study the problem of g-fractional
diffusion in a bounded domain with absorbing boundaries. We find the explicit
solution for the initial-boundary value problem and we study the first passage
time distribution and the mean first-passage time (MFPT). An interestin outcome
is the proof that with a particular choice of the function $g$ it is possible
to obtain a finite MFPT, differently from the anomalous diffusion described by
a fractional heat equation involving the classical Caputo derivative.

<h3>Abstract art generated by Thue-Morse correlation functions</h3>

The Thue-Morse sequence is an aperiodically ordered infinite binary sequence.
It is used as a one-dimensional way to model the structure of a quasicrystal.
For example, taking autocorrelations of these sequences (roughly, measuring how
similar a Thue-Morse sequence is to translates of itself) we can gain
understanding of the diffraction patterns of quasicrystals. We generate
abstract art images from these Thue-Morse autocorrelation functions, that
capture the aperiodic structure of the Thue-Morse sequence in a compelling way.

<h3>3D Spectroscopic Tracking of Individual Brownian Nanoparticles during  Galvanic Exchange</h3>

<br>
Monitoring chemical reactions in solutions at the scale of individual
entities is challenging: single particle detection requires small confocal
volumes which are hardly compatible with Brownian motion, particularly when
long integration times are necessary. Here, we propose a real-time (10 Hz)
holography-based nm-precision 3D tracking of single moving nanoparticles. Using
this localization, the confocal collection volume is dynamically adjusted to
follow the moving nanoparticle and allow continuous spectroscopic monitoring.
This concept is applied to the study galvanic exchange in freely-moving
collo{\"i}dal silver nanoparticles with gold ions generated in-situ. While the
Brownian trajectory reveals particle size, spectral shifts dynamically reveal
composition changes and transformation kinetics at the single object level,
pointing at different transformation kinetics for free and tethered particles.

<h3>Thermal conductivity of glasses above the plateau: first-principles  theory and applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11201" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11201</a>
<br>

<br>
Predicting the thermal conductivity of glasses from first principles has
hitherto been a prohibitively complex problem. In fact, past works have
highlighted challenges in achieving computational convergence with respect to
length and/or time scales using either the established Allen-Feldman or
Green-Kubo formulations, endorsing the concept that atomistic models containing
thousands of atoms -- thus beyond the capabilities of first-principles
calculations -- are needed to describe the thermal conductivity of glasses. In
addition, these established formulations either neglect anharmonicity
(Allen-Feldman) or miss the Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibrations
(Green Kubo), thus leaving open the question on the relevance of these effects.
Here, we present a first-principles formulation to address the thermal
conductivity of glasses above the plateau, which can account comprehensively
for the effects of structural disorder, anharmonicity, and quantum
Bose-Einstein statistics. The protocol combines the Wigner formulation of
thermal transport with convergence-acceleration techniques, and is validated in
vitreous silica using both first-principles calculations and a quantum-accurate
machine-learned interatomic potential. We show that models of vitreous silica
containing less than 200 atoms can already reproduce the thermal conductivity
in the macroscopic limit and that anharmonicity negligibly affects heat
transport in vitreous silica. We discuss the microscopic quantities that
determine the trend of the conductivity at high temperature, highlighting the
agreement of the calculations with experiments in the temperature range above
the plateau where radiative effects remain negligible (50<T <450 K).

<h3>Theoretical investigations on Kerr and Faraday rotations in topological  multi-Weyl Semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11217</a>

<i>Supriyo Ghosh, Ambaresh Sahoo, Snehasish Nandy</i>
<br>
Three-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs) exhibit a variety of intriguing
transport and optical properties due to their unique band topology. Motivated
by the recent proposal of giant Kerr rotation in WSMs, we investigate the Kerr
and Faraday rotations in time-reversal broken multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs) in
the absence of an external magnetic field. We first calculate the optical
conductivity of mWSMs analytically within the framework of Kubo response
theory. We find that both the longitudinal and transverse components of the
conductivity are modified by the topological charge ($n$). Using the obtained
optical conductivity, we show that in the thin film limit of mWSMs, the Kerr
and Faraday rotations are independent of $n$. In contrast, our study reveals
that in the bulk mWSM, the polarization rotation is dominated by the axion
field which modifies Maxwell's equations. We further show that the Kerr
rotation in this limit depends on $n$. In particular, we find that the
magnitude of Kerr rotation decreases with $n$ and the behaviour is
significantly different for different $n$. Our predictions on the behavior of
Kerr and Faraday rotations in mWSM can directly be tested in experiments.
