<h3>Magnetic instability and spin-glass order beyond the Anderson-Mott  transition in interacting power-law random banded matrix fermions</h3>

In the presence of quenched disorder, the competition between local
magnetic-moment formation and Anderson localization for electrons at a
zero-temperature, metal-insulator transition (MIT) remains a long unresolved
problem. Here, we study the interplay of these ingredients in a power-law
random banded matrix model of spin-1/2 fermions with repulsive Hubbard
interactions. Focusing on the regime of weak interactions, we perform both
analytical field theory and numerical self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerical
calculations. We show that interference-mediated effects strongly enhance the
density of states and magnetic fluctuations upon approaching the MIT from the
metallic side. These are consistent with results due to Finkel'stein obtained
four decades ago. Our numerics further show that local moments nucleate from
typical states at the Fermi energy near the MIT, with a density that grows
continuously into the insulating phase. We identify spin-glass order in the
insulator by computing the overlap distribution between converged Hartree-Fock
mean-field moment profiles. Our results indicate that itinerant interference
effects can morph smoothly into moment formation and magnetic frustration
within a single model, revealing a common origin for these disparate phenomena.

<h3>Jordan-Wigner composite-fermion liquids in 2D quantum spin-ice</h3>

The Jordan-Wigner map in 2D is as an exact lattice regularization of the 2
pi-flux attachment to a hard-core boson (or spin-1/2) leading to a
composite-fermion particle. When the spin-1/2 model obeys ice rules this map
preserves locality, namely, local Rohkshar-Kivelson models of spins are mapped
onto local models of Jordan-Wigner/composite-fermions. Using this
composite-fermion dual representation of RK models, we construct spin-liquid
states by projecting Slater determinants onto the subspaces of the ice rules.
Interestingly, we find that these composite-fermions behave as ``dipolar"
partons for which the projective implementations of symmetries are very
different from standard ``point-like" partons. We construct interesting
examples of composite-fermion liquid states that respect all microscopic
symmetries of the RK model. In the six-vertex subspace, we constructed a
time-reversal and particle-hole-invariant state featuring two massless Dirac
nodes, which is a composite-fermion counterpart to the classic pi-flux state of
Abrikosov-Schwinger fermions in the square lattice. This state is a good ground
state candidate for a modified RK-like Hamiltonian of quantum spin-ice. In the
dimer subspace, we construct a state fearturing a composite Fermi surface but
with nesting instabilities towards ordered phases such as the columnar state.
We have also analyzed the low energy emergent gauge structure. If one ignores
confinement, the system would feature a U(1) x U(1) low energy gauge structure
with two associated gapless photon modes, but with the composite fermion
carrying gauge charge only for one photon and behaving as a gauge neutral
dipole under the other. These states are examples of pseudo-scalar U(1) spin
liquids where mirror and time-reversal symmetries act as particle-hole
conjugations, and the emergent magnetic fields are even under such
time-reversal or lattice mirror symmetries.

The ground state of the toric code, that of the two-dimensional class D
superconductor, and the partition sum of the two-dimensional Ising model are
dual to each other. This duality is remarkable inasmuch as it connects systems
commonly associated to different areas of physics -- that of long range
entangled topological order, (topological) band insulators, and classical
statistical mechanics, respectively. Connecting fermionic and bosonic systems,
the duality construction is intrinsically non-local, a complication that has
been addressed in a plethora of different approaches, including dimensional
reduction to one dimension, conformal field theory methods, and operator
algebra. In this work, we propose a unified approach to this duality, whose
main protagonist is a tensor network (TN) assuming the role of an intermediate
translator. Introducing a fourth node into the net of dualities offers several
advantages: the formulation is integrative in that all links of the duality are
treated on an equal footing, (unlike in field theoretical approaches) it is
formulated with lattice precision, a feature that becomes key in the mapping of
correlation functions, and their possible numerical implementation. Finally,
the passage from bosons to fermions is formulated entirely within the
two-dimensional TN framework where it assumes an intuitive and technically
convenient form. We illustrate the predictive potential of the formalism by
exploring the fate of phase transitions, point and line defects, topological
boundary modes, and other structures under the mapping between system classes.
Having condensed matter readerships in mind, we introduce the construction
pedagogically in a manner assuming only minimal familiarity with the concept of
TNs.

<h3>Dynamical defects in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal: self-doping and  kinetic magnetism</h3>

We study the quantum dynamics of interstitials and vacancies in a
two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC) using the semi-classical instanton method
that is asymptotically exact at low density, i.e., in the $r_s\to \infty$
limit. The interstitial dynamics favors local ferromagnetism, while vacancy
dynamics mediates antiferromagnetism. The resulting semi-classical expression
for the interstitial energy vanishes at $r_s =r_{\rm mit}\approx 100$,
signaling a possible self-doping instability to a partially melted WC for some
range of $r_s$ below $r_{\rm mit}$. We thus propose that there exists a
ferromagnetic "metallic electron crystal'' phase of the two-dimensional
electron gas at intermediate densities between a low density insulating WC and
a high density Fermi fluid.

<h3>Stretched-exponential relaxation in weakly-confined Brownian systems  through large deviation theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
Stretched-exponential relaxation is a widely observed phenomenon found in
glassy systems. It was previously modeled with non-Markovian dynamics
reflecting a memory effect. Here, we study a Brownian particle under the
influence of a confining, albeit weak, potential field that grows with distance
as a sub-linear power law. We find that for this memoryless model, observables
display stretched-exponential relaxation. The probability density function of
the system is studied using a rate function ansatz. We obtain analytically the
stretched-exponential exponent along with an anomalous power-law scaling of
length with time. The rate function exhibits a point of nonanalyticity,
indicating a dynamical phase transition. In particular, the rate function is
double-valued both to the left and right of this point, leading to four
different rate functions, depending on the choice of initial conditions and
symmetry.

<h3>Emergent inflation of the Efimov spectrum under three-body spin-exchange  interactions</h3>

<br>
<br>
One of the most fascinating predictions of few-body quantum physics is the
Efimov effect, a universal accumulation of an infinite geometric series of
three-body bound states at a two-body scattering resonance. Ever since the
first experimental observation of such an Efimov state, the precise
characterization of their physical properties has continued to challenge
few-body theory. This is demonstrated most strongly by the lithium few-body
puzzle, a remarkable theoretical discrepancy with the observed Efimov spectrum
in $^7 \text{Li}$. Here, we resolve this long-standing puzzle, demonstrating
that the discrepancy arises out of the presence of strong non-universal
three-body spin-exchange interactions. This conclusion is obtained from a
thorough numerical solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem,
including precise interatomic interactions and all spin degrees of freedom for
three alkali-metal atoms. Our results show excellent agreement with the
experimental data regarding both the Efimov spectrum and the absolute rate
constants of three-body recombination, and in addition reveal a general product
propensity for such triatomic reactions in the Paschen-Back regime, stemming
from Wigner's spin conservation rule.

We investigated the superconducting properties of nanocomposite pellets made
from Bi-2223 and Co$_2$C powders. Our measurements reveal almost 97% loss of
superconducting fraction in the nanocomposites, however, the remaining 3%
fraction exhibits robust bulk superconducting properties. The Tc of the
fraction was 109 K which was found to be comparable to that of the pure Bi-2223
pellet. We found that the composites net magnetization response is a
superposition of ferromagnetic and superconducting fractions contributions.
Analysis revealed that the surviving superconducting fraction exhibits a robust
Meissner response. In the nanocomposite the irreversibility field of the
superconducting fraction at 77 K is found to increase by almost three times
compared to the pristine material, thereby showing strong vortex pinning
features. We also find a broadened magnetic field regime over which we observe
a single vortex pinning regime sustained in the nanocomposite. The critical
current density, Jc, of the nanocomposite was found to be approximately five
times higher than that of the pristine Bi-2223 pellet at low T. In fact, the
enhancement in Jc is most significant in the high T regime, where at
temperatures close to Tc in the nanocomposite we see almost two orders of
magnitude increase of Jc compared to the pristine Bi-2223 pellet. Our study
shows that these composites retain macroscopic superconducting order and
exhibit enhanced Jc, which is important for high current applications.

<br>
<br>
Halide perovskite has attracted intense research interest owing to its
multifaceted and versatile applications in optoelectronics. This intrigue is
further fueled by their propensity to undergo intricate structural
modifications under extreme conditions, thereby instigating property changes.
Within this context, our study delves deep into the intricate interplay of
structural and vibrational attributes within the inorganic-metal halide
perovskite-like CsCuCl3. Our approach employs Raman spectroscopy and
Synchrotron Powder X-Ray Diffraction (SPXRD) techniques harnessed under the
dual conditions of low temperatures and high pressures. We have observed a
distinct spin-phonon coupling mechanism by employing Raman spectroscopy at low
temperatures; this coupling has been manifested as a renormalization phonon
phenomenon that occurs notably at T* = 15 K. The correlation between spin and
phonon dynamics becomes pronounced through a notable hardening of phonon
temperature dependence, a behavior intricately linked to the material
antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 10.7 K. The SPXRD under high pressure
showed a first-order structural phase transition (SPT) at the critical pressure
Pc = 3.69 GPa, leading to the transformation from the hexagonal P6522 to a
base-centered monoclinic cell. Notably, the coexistence of both phases is
discernible within the pressure range from 2.79 to 3.57 GPa, indicating that
the SPT involves the reorganization of the internal [Cu2Cl9]5- dimer unit, with
the Cl-Cu-Cl bending contributing more than stretching modes. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the SPT is reversible, but residual strain pressure influences
the modification of the critical pressure Pc value upon pressure decrease.

<h3>Dissimilarity between synchronization processes on networks</h3>

In this study, we present a framework for comparing two dynamical processes
that describe the synchronization of oscillators coupled through networks. The
differences in the dynamics considered are a consequence of modifications or
variations in the couplings on the same network. We introduce a measure of
dissimilarity defined in terms of a metric on a hypertorus, allowing us to
compare the phases of coupled oscillators. This formalism is implemented to
examine the effect of the weight of an edge in the synchronization of two
oscillators, the introduction of new sets of edges in interacting cycles, the
effect of bias in the couplings and the addition of a link in a ring. We also
compare the synchronization of nonisomorphic graphs with four nodes. Finally,
we study the dissimilarities generated when we contrast the Kuramoto model with
the respective linear approximation for different random initial phases in
deterministic and random networks. The approach introduced provides a general
tool for comparing synchronization processes on networks, allowing us to
understand the dynamics of a complex system as a consequence of the coupling
structure and the processes that can occur in it.

Exciton polaritons, arising from the interaction of electronic transitions
with confined electromagnetic fields, have emerged as a powerful tool to
manipulate the properties of organic materials. However, standard experimental
and theoretical approaches overlook the significant energetic disorder present
in most materials now studied. Using the conjugated polymer P3HT as a model
platform, we systematically tune the degree of energetic disorder and observe a
corresponding redistribution of photonic character within the polariton
manifold. Based on these subtle spectral features, we develop a more
generalized approach to describe strong light-matter coupling in disordered
systems that captures the key spectroscopic observables and provides a
description of the rich manifold of states intermediate between bright and
dark. Applied to a wide range of organic systems, our method challenges
prevailing notions about ultrastrong coupling and whether it can be achieved
with broad, disordered absorbers.

<h3>Non-equilibrium Thermal Resistance of Interfaces Between III-V Compounds</h3>

Interfacial thermal resistance has been often estimated and understood using
the Landauer formalism that assumes incident phonons with equilibrium
distribution. However, previous studies suggest that phonons are
out-of-equilibrium near the interface because of the heat flow through the
leads and the scattering of phonons by the interface. In this paper, we report
a systematic study on how vibrational spectra mismatch affects the degree of
phonon non-equilibrium near an interface, how fast it is relaxed as the phonons
diffuse into a lead, and the overall interfacial thermal resistance from the
non-equilibrium phonons. Our discussion is based on the solution of the
Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation with ab initio inputs for 36 interfaces
between semi-infinite group-III (Al, Ga, In) and group-V (P, As, Sb) compound
semiconductor leads. The simulation reveals that the non-equilibrium phonons
cause significant interfacial thermal resistance for all 36 interfaces, making
the overall interfacial thermal resistance two to three times larger than that
predicted by the Landauer formalism. We observe a clear trend that the degree
of phonon non-equilibrium near an interface and the interfacial thermal
resistance from the non-equilibrium phonons increase as the mismatch of the
Debye temperature of two lead materials increases. This contrasts with Landauer
formalism's predictions, which show no correlation with the Debye temperature
mismatch. The relaxation length of the phonon non-equilibrium varies
significantly from 50nm to 1.5um depending on the combination of the lead
materials. The relaxation length is proportional to the phonon mean free path
of the corresponding lead material but also largely depends on the material in
the opposite lead. This suggests the relaxation length cannot be considered an
intrinsic property of the corresponding lead material.

<h3>Associative memory by virtual oscillator network based on single  spin-torque oscillator</h3>

A coupled oscillator network may be able to perform an energy-efficient
associative memory operation. However, its realization has been difficult
because inhomogeneities unavoidably arise among the oscillators during
fabrication and lead to an unreliable operation. This issue could be resolved
if the oscillator network were able to be formed from a single oscillator.
Here, we performed numerical simulations and theoretical analyses on an
associative memory operation that uses a virtual oscillator network based on a
spin-torque oscillator. The virtual network combines the concept of coupled
oscillators with that of feedforward neural networks. Numerical experiments
demonstrate successful associations of $60$-pixel patterns with various
memorized patterns. Moreover, the origin of the associative memory is shown to
be forced synchronization driven by feedforward input, where phase differences
among oscillators are fixed and correspond to the colors of the pixels in the
pattern.

<h3>Strong unidirectional Rashba state induced by the extended vacancy line  defect in the $1T'$-WTe$_{2}$ monolayer</h3>

<br>
The correlation between spin-orbit coupling and low crystal symmetry in the
$1T'$-WTe$_{2}$ monolayer (ML) plays a significant role in its electronic and
topological properties. However, the centrosymmetric nature of the crystal
enforced the $1T'$-WTe$_{2}$ ML to maintain spin degeneracy in its electronic
states, which limits its functionality in spintronics. In this paper, through a
systematic study using first-principles calculations, we show that significant
spin splitting can be induced in the $1T'$-WTe$_{2}$ ML by introducing one
dimensional (1D) vacancy line defect (VLD). We calculate the energetic
stability of three different configurations of the VLD extended along the
armchair direction, namely (i) Te$_{1}$ VLD ($V_{\texttt{Te}_{1}}$), (ii)
Te$_{2}$ VLD ($V_{\texttt{Te}_{2}}$), and (iii) W VLD ($V_{\texttt{W}}$), where
Te$_{1}$ and Te$_{2}$ are two nonequivalent Te atoms located at the lower and
higher sites in the top layer, respectively, and find that both the
$V_{\texttt{Te}_{1}}$ and $V_{\texttt{W}}$ systems have the lowest formation
energy. Concerning the two stablest VLD systems ($V_{\texttt{Te}_{1}}$,
$V_{\texttt{W}}$), we identify large spin splitting in the defect states near
the Fermi level driven by a strong $p-d$ coupling, displaying a highly
unidirectional Rashba states with perfectly collinear spin configurations in
the momentum space. This unique spin configuration gives rise to a specific
spin mode that protects the spin from decoherence and leads to an exceptionally
long spin lifetime. Furthermore, the observed unidirectional Rashba states are
enforced by

As an ideal platform, both the theoretical prediction and first experimental
verification of chiral phonons are based on transition-metal dichalcogenide
materials. The manipulation of phonon chirality in these materials will have a
profound impact on the study of chiral phonons. In this work, we utilize the
sliding ferroelectric mechanism to study the phonon chirality manipulation
mechanism in transition-metal dichalcogenide materials. Based on
first-principles calculations, we study the different effects of interlayer
sliding on the phonon properties in bilayer and four-layer MoS$_2$ sliding
ferroelectrics. We find that sliding can regulate phonon chirality and Berry
curvature, which further affects the phonon angular momentum and magnetization
under a temperature gradient and the phonon Hall effect under a magnetic field.
Our work connects two emerging fields and opens up a new route to manipulate
phonon chirality in transition-metal dichalcogenide materials through the
sliding ferroelectric mechanism.

<h3>Theory of polygonal phases self-assembled from T-shaped liquid  crystalline polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13262</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Extensive experimental studies have shown that numerous ordered phases can be
formed via the self-assembly of T-shaped liquid crystalline polymers (TLCPs)
composed of a rigid backbone, two flexible end chains and a flexible side
chain. However, a comprehensive understanding of the stability and formation
mechanisms of these intricately nano-structured phases remains incomplete. Here
we fill this gap by carrying out a theoretical study of the phase behaviour of
TLCPs. Specifically, we construct phase diagrams of TLCPs by computing the free
energy of different ordered phases of the system. Our results reveal that the
number of polygonal edges increases as the length of side chain or interaction
strength increases, consistent with experimental observations. The theoretical
study not only reproduces the experimentally observed phases and phase
transition sequences, but also systematically analyzes the stability mechanism
of the polygonal phases.

In this paper we present a thorough first-principles based density functional
theory study of the structural stability, electronic, magnetic, and optical
properties of pristine and doped gallium phosphide (GaP) monolayers. The
pristine GaP monolayer is found to have a periodically buckled structure, with
an indirect band gap of 2.15 eV. The doping by X (B, Al, In, C, Si, Ge, Sn, Zn,
Cd) at the Ga site, and Y (N, As, Sb, O, S, Se, Te, Zn, Cd) at the P site is
considered, and an indirect to direct transition is observed after doping by In
at the Ga site. For several cases, significant changes in the band gap are seen
after doping, while system becomes metallic when O is substituted at the P
site. The spin-polarized band structures are calculated for the monolayers with
doping-induced magnetism, and we find that for some cases a direct band gap
appears for one of the spin orientations. For such cases, we investigate the
intriguing possibility of spin-dependent optical properties. Furthermore for
several cases, the band gap is very small for one of the spin orientations,
suggesting the possibility of engineering half metallicity by doping. For the
layers with direct band gaps, the calculated optical absorption spectra are
found to span a wide energy range in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The
calculated formation energies of both the pristine and doped structures are
quite small, indicating that the laboratory realization of such structures is
quite feasible. On the whole, our results suggest that the doped GaP monolayer
is a material with potentially a wide range of applications in nanoelectronics,
spintronics, optoelectronics, solar cells, etc.

Particle segregation in dense flowing size-disperse granular mixtures is
driven by gravity and shear, but predicting the associated segregation force
due to both effects has remained an unresolved challenge. Here, a model of the
combined gravity- and kinematics-induced segregation force on a single intruder
particle is integrated with a model of the concentration dependence of the
gravity-induced segregation force. The result is a general model of the net
particle segregation force in flowing size-bidisperse granular mixtures. Using
discrete element method simulations for comparison, the model correctly
predicts the segregation force for a variety of mixture concentrations and flow
conditions in both idealized and natural shear flows.

Ultrafast manipulation of vibrational coherence is an emergent route to
control the structure of solids. However, this strategy can only induce
long-range correlations and cannot modify atomic structure locally, which is
required in many technologically-relevant phase transitions. Here, we
demonstrate that ultrafast lasers can generate incoherent structural
fluctuations which are more efficient for material control than coherent
vibrations, extending optical control to a wider range of materials. We observe
that local, non-equilibrium lattice distortions generated by a weak laser pulse
reduce the energy barrier to switch between insulating and metallic states in
vanadium dioxide by 6%. Seeding inhomogeneous structural-fluctuations presents
an alternative, more energy efficient, route for controlling materials that may
be applicable to all solids, including those used in data and energy storage
devices.

We use the finite projected entangled pair state (PEPS) method to investigate
the global phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$
antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg model. The ground state phase diagram is
established with a rich variety of phases: AFM, gapless quantum spin liquid,
valence-bond solid (VBS), stripe, and incommensurate spiral phases. The nature
of the VBS region is revealed, containing a plaquette VBS and a mixed
columnar-plaquette VBS, with the emergence of short-range incommensurate spin
correlations in some region. The long-range incommensurate magnetic phase is
also explicitly characterized as a planar spiral with incommensurate spatial
periodicities. Most interestingly, there exists several multicritical points
connecting different phases. These findings elucidate the true nature of the
long-standing square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ antiferromagnet at
zero-temperature. Our results also pave the way to accurately simulate complex
two-dimensional quantum systems that may host nonuniform features by means of
finite PEPS.

Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilised for achieving
optimised performance in modern semiconductor devices. While alloying has been
studied in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, its application in van
der Waals heterostructures built from atomically thin layers is largely
unexplored. Here, we fabricate heterobilayers made from monolayers of WSe$_2$
(or MoSe$_2$) and Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ alloy and observe nontrivial tuning of
the resultant bandstructure as a function of concentration $x$. We monitor this
evolution by measuring the energy of photoluminescence (PL) of the interlayer
exciton (IX) composed of an electron and hole residing in different monolayers.
In Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$/WSe$_2$, we observe a strong IX energy shift of
$\approx$100 meV for $x$ varied from 1 to 0.6. However, for $x<0.6$ this shift
saturates and the IX PL energy asymptotically approaches that of the indirect
bandgap in bilayer WSe$_2$. We theoretically interpret this observation as the
strong variation of the conduction band K valley for $x>0.6$, with IX PL
arising from the K-K transition, while for $x<0.6$, the bandstructure
hybridization becomes prevalent leading to the dominating momentum-indirect K-Q
transition. This bandstructure hybridization is accompanied with strong
modification of IX PL dynamics and nonlinear exciton properties. Our work
provides foundation for bandstructure engineering in van der Waals
heterostructures highlighting the importance of hybridization effects and
opening a way to devices with accurately tailored electronic properties.

Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are low-temperature processable hybrid
semiconductor materials with exceptional performances that are revolutionizing
the field of optoelectronic devices. Despite their great potential, commercial
deployment is hindered by MHPs lack of stability and durability, mainly
attributed to ions migration and chemical interactions with the device
electrodes. To address these issues, 2D layered MHPs have been investigated as
possible device interlayers or active material substitutes to reduce ion
migration and improve stability. Here we consider the 2D perovskite PEA2PbBr4
that was recently discussed as very promising candidate for X-ray direct
detection. While the increased resilience of PEA2PbBr4 detectors have already
been reported, the physical mechanisms responsible for such improvement
compared to the standard "3D" perovskites are not still fully understood. To
unravel the charge transport process in PEA2PbBr4 crystals thought to underly
the device better performance, we adapted an investigation technique previously
used on highly resistive inorganic semiconductors, called photo induced current
transient spectroscopy (PICTS). We demonstrate that PICTS can detect three
distinct trap states (T1, T2, and T3) with different activation energies, and
that the trap states evolution upon X-ray exposure can explain PEA2PbBr4
superior radiation tolerance and reduced aging effects. Overall, our results
provide essential insights into the stability and electrical characteristics of
2D perovskites and their potential application as reliable and direct X-ray
detectors.

Rydberg electromagnetically-induced transparency has been widely studied as a
medium supporting light propagation under the action of nonlocal
nonlinearities. Recently, optical potentials based on moir\'e lattices (MLs)
were introduced for exploring unconventional physical states. Here, we predict
a possibility of creating fully three-dimensional (3D) light bullets (LBs) in
cold Rydberg gases under the action of ML potentials. The nonlinearity includes
local self-defocusing and long-range focusing terms, the latter one induced by
the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction. We produce zero-vorticity LB families of the
fundamental, dipole, and quadrupole types, as well as vortex LBs. They all are
gap solitons populating finite bandgaps of the underlying ML spectrum. Stable
subfamilies are identified utilizing the combination of the
anti-Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion, computation of eigenvalues for small
perturbations, and direct simulations.

We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a thermal bath
that contains active particles. The particle moves in a harmonic potential and
experiences Poisson shot-noise kicks with specified amplitude distribution due
to moving active particles in the bath. From the Fokker-Planck equation for the
particle dynamics we derive the stationary solution for the displacement
distribution along with the moments characterizing mean, variance, skewness,
and kurtosis. We also obtain the equilibrium mapping for this non-equilibrium
system and the effective temperature. Our results clearly show the deviation of
the non-equilibrium stationary state from the equilibrium Gaussian behaviour.
For the case of Gaussian-distributed active kicks we find a re-entrant
behaviour from active to passive states and a heavy-tailed leptokurtic
distribution across a wide range of parameters as seen in recent experimental
studies. We also reveal statistical signatures of the irreversible dynamics of
the particle displacement in terms of the time asymmetry of cross-correlation
functions.

<h3>Giant electrostriction in bulk RE (III) substituted CeO2: effect of RE  3+ and its concentration</h3>

Recent discovery of giant electrostriction in rare earth (RE (III))
substituted ceria (CeO2) thin films driven by electroactive defect complexes
and their coordinated elastic response, expands the material spectrum for
electrostrain applications beyond the conventional piezoelectric materials.
Especially Gd substituted CeO2, with Gd concentration >10% seems to be an ideal
material to obtain such large electrostrain response. However, there are not
many experimental studies that systematically investigate the effect of RE
(III) ion-defect interaction and RE concentration on electrostriction. Here we
perform structure-property correlation studies in bulk ceramics of RE3+
substituted ceria doped with RE=Y, La and Gd at various concentrations upto a
maximum of 20%, to understand the features responsible for giant
electrostriction. Our results show that Y substituted ceria, with atleast 20% Y
substitution, is clearly both a giant M and a Q electrostrictor at low
frequencies (<20 Hz), and this correlates with the unique attractive
defect-dopant interaction of Y with oxygen vacancies. La has a repulsive
interaction with oxygen vacancies, and La doped ceria at all the studied
compositions (upto 20%) does not show giant electrostiction. Gd has a neutral
interaction, and only 20% Gd doped ceria at best falls at the border of
classification between giant and non-giant electrostrictors at frequencies
<0.05 Hz. Our work takes a step back from thin-films and assesses the
fundamental defect features required in the design of giant electrostrictors.

<h3>Boundary algebras of the Kitaev Quantum Double model</h3>

The recent article [arXiv:2307.12552] gave local topological order (LTO)
axioms for a quantum spin system, showed they held in Kitaev's Toric Code and
in Levin-Wen string net models, and gave a bulk boundary correspondence to
describe bulk excitations in terms of the boundary net of algebras. In this
article, we prove the LTO axioms for Kitaev's Quantum Double model for a finite
group $G$. We identify the boundary nets of algebras with fusion categorical
nets associated to $(\mathsf{Hilb}(G),\mathbb{C}[G])$ or
$(\mathsf{Rep}(G),\mathbb{C}^G)$ depending on whether the boundary cut is rough
or smooth respectively. This allows us to make connections to work of Ogata on
the type of the cone von Neumann algebras in the algebraic quantum field theory
approach to topological superselection sectors. We show that the boundary
algebras can also be calculated from a trivial $G$-symmetry protected
topological phase ($G$-SPT), and that the gauging map preserves the boundary
algebras. Finally, we compute the boundary algebras for the (3+1)D Quantum
Double model associated to an abelian group.

<br>
<br>
In 1T-TaS$_{2-x}$Se$_x$, the charge density wave (CDW) state features a star
of David lattice that expands across layers as the system becomes commensurate
on cooling. The layers can also order along the c-axis and different stacking
orders have been proposed. Using neutron scattering on powder samples, we
compared the stacking order previously observed in 1T-TaS$_2$ as the system is
doped with Se. While at low temperature, a 13c layer sequence stacking was
observed in TaS$_2$, this type of ordering was not evident with doping. Doping
with Se results in a nearly commensurate state with the Mott state suppressed
which may be linked to the absence of the layer stacking.

<h3>A treatment of particle-electrolyte sharp interface fracture in  solid-state batteries with multi-field discontinuities</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we present a computational framework for coupled
electro-chemo-(nonlinear) mechanics at the particle scale for solid-state
batteries. The framework accounts for interfacial fracture between the active
particles and solid electrolyte due to intercalation stresses. We extend
discontinuous finite element methods for a sharp interface treatment of
discontinuities in concentrations, fluxes, electric fields and in
displacements, the latter arising from active particle-solid electrolyte
interface fracture. We model the degradation in the charge transfer process
that results from the loss of contact due to fracture at the electrolyte-active
particle interfaces. Additionally, we account for the stress-dependent kinetics
that can influence the charge transfer reactions and solid state diffusion. The
discontinuous finite element approach does not require a conformal mesh. This
offers the flexibility to construct arbitrary particle shapes and geometries
that are based on design, or are obtained from microscopy images. The finite
element mesh, however, can remain Cartesian, and independent of the particle
geometries. We demonstrate this computational framework on micro-structures
that are representative of solid-sate batteries with single and multiple anode
and cathode particles.

<h3>Spin-driven electric polarization from strong 4d-4f cross-coupling in  6H-perovskite Ba3HoRu2O9</h3>

<br>
<br>
The occurrence of spin-driven polarization is rarely observed in 4d or 5d
transition-metal oxides, compared to their 3d-transition-metal oxide
counterparts, despite theoretical predictions of the good possibility of
multiferroicity in higher d-orbital systems. Here we have studied a prototype
4d-4f compound, Ba3HoRu2O9, through time-of-flight neutron diffraction, ac
susceptibility, and complex dielectric spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the
non-colinear structure involving two different magnetic ions, Ru(4d) and
Ho(4f), breaks the spatial inversion symmetry via inverse Dzyaloshinskii Moriya
(D-M) interaction through strong 4d-4f magnetic correlation, which results in
non-zero polarization. The stronger spin-orbit coupling of 4d-orbital might
play a major role in creating D-M interaction of non-linear spins. We have
systematically investigated the magnetoelectric domain dynamics in this system,
which exhibits intriguing behavior with shorter correlation lengths. Further,
we have investigated the effect of external pressure on the magnetic
transition. The result reveals an enhancement of ordering temperature by the
application of external pressure (1.6K per GPa). We speculate that external
pressure might favor stabilizing the magnetoelectric phase. Our study shows a
route to designing magnetoelectric multiferroic compounds containing larger
d-orbital through strong 4d-4f cross-coupling.

<h3>Enhanced radiation damage tolerance of amorphous interphase and grain  boundary complexions in Cu-Ta</h3>

<br>
Amorphous interfacial complexions are particularly resistant to radiation
damage and have been primarily studied in alloys with good glass-forming
ability, yet recent reports suggest that these features can form even in
immiscible alloys such as Cu-Ta under irradiation. In this study, the
mechanisms of damage production and annihilation due to primary knock-on atom
collisions are investigated for amorphous interphase and grain boundaries in a
Cu-Ta alloy using atomistic simulations. Amorphous complexions, in particular
amorphous interphase complexions that separate Cu and Ta grains, result in less
residual defect damage than their ordered counterparts. Stemming from the
nanophase chemical separation in this alloy, the amorphous complexions exhibit
a highly heterogeneous distribution of atomic excess volume, as compared to a
good glass former like Cu-Zr. Complexion thickness, a tunable structural
descriptor, plays a vital role in damage resistance. Thicker interfacial films
are more damage-tolerant because they alter the defect production rate due to
differences in intrinsic displacement threshold energies during the collision
cascade. Overall, the findings of this work highlight the importance of
interfacial engineering in enhancing the properties of materials operating in
radiation-prone environments and the promise of amorphous complexions as
particularly radiation damage-tolerant microstructural features.

The use of trivalent erbium (Er$^{3+}$), typically embedded as an atomic
defect in the solid-state, has widespread adoption as a dopant in
telecommunications devices and shows promise as a spin-based quantum memory for
quantum communication. In particular, its natural telecom C-band optical
transition and spin-photon interface makes it an ideal candidate for
integration into existing optical fiber networks without the need for quantum
frequency conversion. However, successful scaling requires a host material with
few intrinsic nuclear spins, compatibility with semiconductor foundry
processes, and straightforward integration with silicon photonics. Here, we
present Er-doped titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) thin film growth on silicon
substrates using a foundry-scalable atomic layer deposition process with a wide
range of doping control over the Er concentration. Even though the as-grown
films are amorphous, after oxygen annealing they exhibit relatively large
crystalline grains, and the embedded Er ions exhibit the characteristic optical
emission spectrum from anatase TiO$_2$. Critically, this growth and annealing
process maintains the low surface roughness required for nanophotonic
integration. Finally, we interface Er ensembles with high quality factor Si
nanophotonic cavities via evanescent coupling and demonstrate a large Purcell
enhancement (300) of their optical lifetime. Our findings demonstrate a
low-temperature, non-destructive, and substrate-independent process for
integrating Er-doped materials with silicon photonics. At high doping densities
this platform can enable integrated photonic components such as on-chip
amplifiers and lasers, while dilute concentrations can realize single ion
quantum memories.

Surface states of a topological insulator demonstrate interesting quantum
phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and the quantum
magnetoelectric effect. Fermi energy tuning plays a role in inducing phase
transitions and developing future device functions. Here, we report on
controlling the topological phases in a dual-gate field-effect transistor of a
semi-magnetic topological insulator heterostructure. The heterostructure
consists of magnetized one-surface and non-magnetic other-surface. By tuning
the Fermi energy to the energy gap of the magnetized surface, the Hall
conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ becomes close to the half-integer quantized Hall
conductivity $e^2/2h$, exemplifying parity anomaly. The dual-gate control
enables the band structure alignment to the two quantum Hall states with
$\sigma_{xy} = e^2/h$ and 0 under a strong magnetic field. These states are
topologically equivalent to the QAH and axion insulator states, respectively.
Precise and independent control of the band alignment of the top and bottom
surfaces successively induces various topological phase transitions among the
QAH, axion insulator, and parity anomaly states in magnetic topological
insulators.

Unconventional superconductivity (USC) in a highly correlated kagome system
has been theoretically proposed for years, yet the experimental realization is
hard to achieve. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials, which
exhibit both superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) orders, are
nonmagnetic and weakly correlated, thus unlikely host USC as theories proposed.
Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome bad metal,
CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, which is contrastingly characterised by significant electron
correlations and frustrated magnetism. Successive phase transitions at $\sim$54
K with stripe-like $4a_0$ structural modulations are observed, probably
associated with CDW and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) orderings.
Under moderately high pressures of 4-8 GPa, these density-wave orders are
suppressed and, remarkably, superconductivity emerges with a maximum
$T_\mathrm{c}$ of 6.4 K. A quantum critical point at $P_\mathrm{c}\approx$ 4
GPa is revealed, by which non-Fermi-liquid behaviours show up, reminiscent of
USC in iron-based superconductors. The electronic structure calculations
indicate that the electron filling is close to the characteristic flat bands of
the kagome lattice. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating
the mechanism of USC in a correlated kagome system.

The rate of fatigue crack growth in Nickle superalloys is a critical factor

<h3>Upper branch thermal Hall effect in quantum paramagnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Bowen Ma, Z. D. Wang, Gang Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
Inspired by the persistent thermal Hall effects at finite temperatures in
various quantum paramagnets, we explore the origin of the thermal Hall effects
from the perspective of the upper branch parts by invoking the dispersive and
twisted crystal field excitations. It is shown that the upper branches of the
local energy levels could hybridize and form the dispersive bands. The
observation is that, upon the time-reversal symmetry breaking by the magnetic
fields, these upper branch bands could acquire a Berry curvature distribution
and contribute to the thermal Hall effect in the paramagnetic regime. As a
proof of principle, we consider the setting on the kagom\'e lattice with one
ground state singlet and an excited doublet, and show this is indeed possible.
We expect this effect to be universal and has no strong connection with the
underlying lattice. Although the thermal Hall signal can be contributed from
other sources such as phonons and their scattering in the actual materials, we
discuss the application to the Mott systems with the large local Hilbert
spaces.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we perform real time simulations for probing the non-Abelian
fusion of a pair of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The nontrivial fusion outcomes
can be either a vacuum, or an unpaired fermion, which reflect the underlying
non-Abelian statistics. The two possible outcomes can cause different charge
variations in the nearby probing quantum dot (QD), while the charge occupation
in the dot is detected by a quantum point contact. In particular, we find that
gradual fusion and gradual coupling of the MZMs to the QD (in nearly adiabatic
switching-on limit) provide a simpler detection scheme than sudden coupling
after fusion to infer the coexistence of two fusion outcomes, by measuring the
occupation probability of the QD. For the scheme of sudden coupling (after
fusion), we propose and analyze continuous weak measurement for the quantum
oscillations of the QD occupancy. From the power spectrum of the measurement
currents, one can identify the characteristic frequencies and infer thus the
coexistence of the fusion outcomes.

The ``Eshelby problem" refers to the response of a 2-dimensional elastic
sheet to cutting away a circle, deforming it into an ellipse, and pushing it
back. The resulting response is dominated by the so-called ``Eshelby Kernel"
which was derived for purely elastic (infinite) material, but has been employed
extensively to model the redistribution of stress after plastic events in
amorphous solids with finite boundaries. Here we discuss and solve the Eshelby
problem directly for amorphous solids, taking into account possible screening
effects and realistic boundary conditions. We find major modifications compared
to the classical Eshelby solution. These modification are needed for modeling
correctly the spatial responses to plastic events in amorphous solids.

Computational solid mechanics has become an indispensable approach in
engineering, and numerical investigation of fracture in composites is essential
as composites are widely used in structural applications. Crack evolution in
composites is the bridge to elucidate the relationship between the
microstructure and fracture performance, but crack-based finite element methods
are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their application in
computation-intensive scenarios. Here we propose a deep learning framework
called Crack-Net, which incorporates the relationship between crack evolution
and stress response to predict the fracture process in composites. Trained on a
high-precision fracture development dataset generated using the phase field
method, Crack-Net demonstrates a remarkable capability to accurately forecast
the long-term evolution of crack growth patterns and the stress-strain curve
for a given composite design. The Crack-Net captures the essential principle of
crack growth, which enables it to handle more complex microstructures such as
binary co-continuous structures. Moreover, transfer learning is adopted to
further improve the generalization ability of Crack-Net for composite materials
with reinforcements of different strengths. The proposed Crack-Net holds great
promise for practical applications in engineering and materials science, in
which accurate and efficient fracture prediction is crucial for optimizing
material performance and microstructural design.

<br>
<br>
We perform an in-depth investigation of the phase diagram of the $J_1-J_2$
Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We take advantage of Density Matrix
Renormalization Group and Fully-Augmented Matrix Product States methods and
reach unprecedented accuracy with large bond dimensions. We utilize
excited-level crossing analysis to pinpoint the phase transition points. It was
believed before that there exists a narrow spin liquid phase sandwiched by the
N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and valence bond solid (VBS) phases. Through
careful finite size scaling of the level crossing points, we find a direct
phase transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases at $J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$,
suggesting the absence of an intermediate spin liquid phase. We also provide
accurate results for ground state energies for a variety of sizes, from which
we find the transition between the N\'eel AFM and VBS phases is continuous.
These results indicate the existence of a deconfined quantum critical point at
$J_2/J_1 = 0.535(3)$ in the model. From the crossing of the first derivative of
the energies with $J_2$ for different sizes, we also determine the precise
location of the first order phase transition between the VBS and stripe AFM
phases at $J_2/J_1=0.610(5)$.

<br>
<br>
This brief reports the analytical modeling and measurements of the inflection
in the MOSFET transfer characteristics at cryogenic temperatures. Inflection is
the inward bending of the drain current versus gate voltage, which reduces the
current in weak and moderate inversion at a given gate voltage compared to the
drift-diffusion current. This phenomenon is explained by introducing a Gaussian
distribution of localized states centered around the band edge. The localized
states are attributed to disorder and interface traps. The proposed model
allows to extract the density of localized states at the interface from the dc
current measurements.

<br>
<br>
Materials design has traditionally evolved through trial-error approaches,
mainly due to the non-local relationship between microstructures and properties
such as strength and toughness. We propose 'alloy informatics' as a machine
learning based prototype predictive approach for alloys and compounds, using
electron charge density profiles derived from first-principle calculations. We
demonstrate this framework in the case of hydrogen interstitials in
face-centered cubic crystals, showing that their differential electron charge
density profiles capture crystal properties and defect-crystal interaction
properties. Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) of defect-induced differential
charge density perturbations highlight the resulting screening effect, and,
together with hydrogen Bader charges, strongly correlate to a large set of
atomic properties of the metal species forming the bulk crystal. We observe the
spontaneous emergence of classes of charge responses while coarse-graining over
crystal compositions. Nudge-Elastic-Band calculations show that RDFs and charge
features also connect to hydrogen migration energy barriers between
interstitial sites. Unsupervised machine-learning on RDFs supports
classification, unveiling compositional and configurational non-localities in
the similarities of the perturbed densities. Electron charge density
perturbations may be considered as bias-free descriptors for a large variety of
defects.

wetting phase diagram that depends only on atomic masses and scattering
lengths. This is unique in theories of surface and interfacial phase
transitions and provides a new opportunity for experimental observation of
wetting phenomena in BEC mixtures. Previous GP theory for two-component BEC
relied on an {\it ad hoc} optical wall boundary condition, on which the
character and location of the wetting phase transitions depend sensitively.
This boundary condition dependence is eliminated by adding a third component
and treating the three phases on equal footing. An unequivocal wetting phase
diagram is captured, with phase boundaries calculated analytically using an
extension of the established double-parabola approximation.

<br>
<br>
The incessant technological pursuit towards a more sustainable and green
future depends strongly on permanent magnets. At present, their use is
widespread, making it imperative to develop new processing methods that
generate highly competitive magnetic properties reducing the fabrication
temperatures and costs. Herein, a novel strategy for developing dense sintered
magnets based on Sr-hexaferrites with upper functional characteristics is
presented. An innovative cold sintering approach using glacial acetic acid as
novelty, followed by a post-annealing at 1100 {\deg}C, achieves a densification
of the ceramic magnets of 92% with respect to the theoretical density and
allows controlling the particle growth. After the cold sintering process, a
fraction of amorphous SrO is identified, in addition to a partial
transformation to {\alpha}-Fe2O3 as secondary crystalline phase. 46 wt% of
SrFe12O19 remains, which is mostly recuperated after the post-thermal
treatment. These findings do not significantly modify the final structure of
ferrite magnets, neither at short- nor long-range order. The innovative process
has a positive impact on the magnetic properties, yielding competitive ferrite
magnets at lower sintering temperatures with an energy efficiency of at least
25%, which opens up a new horizon in the field of rare-earth free permanent
magnets and new possibilities in other applications.

We show that it is possible to tune the N\'eel temperature of
nickel(II)-cobalt(II) oxide films by changing the Ni to Co ratio. We grow
single crystalline micrometric triangular islands with tens of nanometers
thickness on a Ru(0001) substrate using high temperature oxygen-assisted
molecular beam epitaxy. Composition is controlled by adjusting the deposition
rates of Co and Ni. The morphology, shape, crystal structure and composition
are determined by low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction, and
synchrotron-based x-ray absorption spectromicroscopy. The antiferromagnetic
order is observed by x-ray magnetic linear dichroism. Antiferromagnetic domains
up to micrometer width are observed.

<br>
<br>
The fracture of end-linked polymer networks and gels has a significant impact
on the performance of these versatile and widely used materials, and a
molecular-level understanding of the fracture process is crucial for the design
of new materials. Network analysis techniques, especially geodesic edge
betweenness centrality (GEBC) have been proven effective in failure locations
across various network materials. In this work, we employ a combination of
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis techniques
to investigate the effectiveness of GEBC and polymer strand orientation in
predicting failure locations in model end-linked polymer networks. We
demonstrate that polymer strands with fewer topological defects in their local
surroundings, higher GEBC values compared to the system average, and greater
alignment to the deformation axis are more prone to breaking under the uniaxial
tensile deformation. Our results can be used to further refine the description
of the processes at play during the failure of polymer networks and provide
valuable insights into the inverse design of network materials with desired
fracture properties.

<br>
<br>
Due to the issues associated with rare-earth elements, there arises a strong
need for magnets with properties between those of ferrites and rare-earth
magnets that could substitute the latter in selected applications. Here, we
produce a high remanent magnetization composite bonded magnet by mixing FeCo
nanowire powders with hexaferrite particles. In the first step, metallic
nanowires with diameters between 30 and 100 nm and length of at least 2 {\mu}m
are fabricated by electrodeposition. The oriented as-synthesized nanowires show
remanence ratios above 0.76 and coercivities above 199 kA/m and resist core
oxidation up to 300 {\deg}C due to the existence of a > 8 nm thin oxide
passivating shell. In the second step, a composite powder is fabricated by
mixing the nanowires with hexaferrite particles. After the optimal nanowire
diameter and composite composition are selected, a bonded magnet is produced.
The resulting magnet presents a 20% increase in remanence and an enhancement of
the energy product of 48% with respect to a pure hexaferrite (strontium
ferrite) magnet. These results put nanowire-ferrite composites at the forefront
as candidate materials for alternative magnets for substitution of rare earths
in applications that operate with moderate magnet performance.

<br>
<br>
CoFe2O4/Co-Fe magnetic composites are usually prepared through partial
reduction of CoFe2O4, which often yields monoxides (i.e., FeO, CoO) as
secondary phases. Since these compounds are paramagnetic at ambient conditions,
the presence of a small amount of monoxide is generally downplayed in the
literature, and the possible effects on the magnetic properties are simply
ignored. However, the present study shows that even a low concentration of
monoxide results in decoupling of the soft and hard magnetic phases, which
inevitably leads to a deterioration of the magnetic properties. Additionally,
it is confirmed that a partial reduction of CoFe2O4 is a suitable method to
produce CoFe2O4/Co-Fe nanocomposites, provided that the treatment is well
controlled with respect to duration, temperature and flow of reductant. A
monoxide-free nanocomposite was produced and its magnetic properties evaluated
both at room and low temperature. Our model system exemplifies the potential of
exchange-coupling (and decoupling) as a tool to tune the magnetic properties of
a material within a relatively wide range of values, thus widening its spectrum
of potential applications.

<br>
<br>
During the past decade, CoFe2O4 (hard)/Co-Fe alloy (soft) magnetic
nanocomposites have been routinely prepared by partial reduction of CoFe2O4
nanoparticles. Monoxide (i.e., FeO or CoO) has often been detected as a
byproduct of the reduction, although it remains unclear whether the formation
of this phase occurs during the reduction itself or at a later stage. Here, a
novel reaction cell was designed to monitor the reduction in situ using
synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Sequential Rietveld refinements of
the in situ data yielded time-resolved information on the sample composition
and confirmed that the monoxide is generated as an intermediate phase. The
macroscopic magnetic properties of samples at different reduction stages were
measured by means of vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), revealing a magnetic
softening with increasing soft phase content, which was too pronounced to be
exclusively explained by the introduction of soft material in the system. The
elemental compositions of the constituent phases were obtained from joint
Rietveld refinements of ex situ high-resolution PXRD and neutron powder
diffraction (NPD) data. It was found that the alloy has a tendency to emerge in
a Co-rich form, inducing a Co deficiency on the remaining spinel phase, which
can explain the early softening of the magnetic material.

<br>
<br>
Technical optics with matter waves requires a universal description of
three-dimensional traps, lenses, and complex matter-wave fields. In analogy to
the two-dimensional Zernike expansion in beam optics, we present a
three-dimensional multipole expansion for Bose-condensed matter waves and
optical devices. We characterize real magnetic chip traps, optical dipole
traps, and the complex matter-wave field in terms of spherical harmonics and
radial Stringari polynomials. We illustrate this procedure for typical harmonic
model potentials as well as real magnetic and optical dipole traps. Eventually,
we use the multipole expansion to characterize the aberrations of a
ballistically interacting expanding Bose-Einstein condensate in
(3+1)-dimensions. In particular, we find deviations from the quadratic phase
ansatz in the popular scaling approximation. This universal multipole
description of aberrations can be used to optimize matter-wave optics setups,
for example in matter-wave interferometers.

An analytical procedure for calculating the critical temperature and
estimating the size of critical region for a cell fluid model is developed. Our
numerical calculations are illustrated by the case of the Morse potential
parameters characterizing the alkali metals (sodium and potassium). The
critical temperatures found for liquid sodium and potassium as solutions of the
resulting quadratic equation agree with experimental data. The expression for
the relative temperature determining the critical region size is obtained
proceeding from the condition for the critical regime existence. In the cases
of sodium and potassium, the value of this temperature is of the order of a few

We introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or

an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for

Recent resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) experiments revealed a novel charge
order in highly overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO). The observed charge
order appears around the $(\pi/3,0)$ wavevector and remains robust from
cryogenic temperatures to room temperature. To investigate the origin of this
charge order in the overdoped region, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo
(DQMC) simulations to examine models with various interactions. We demonstrate
that this CDW originates from remnant correlations in overdoped cuprates. The
doping-independent wavevector $(\pi/3,0)$ further reflects the presence of
nonlocal electron-phonon couplings. Our study reveals the importance of phonons
in the cuprates, which assist correlated electrons in the formation of exotic
phases.

<h3>Non-Volatile Resistive Switching of Polymer Residues in 2D Material  Memristors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) materials are popular candidates for emerging nanoscale
devices, including memristors. Resistive switching (RS) in such 2D material
memristors has been attributed to the formation and dissolution of conductive
filaments created by the diffusion of metal ions between the electrodes.
However, the area-scalable fabrication of patterned devices involves polymers
that are difficult to remove from the 2D material interfaces without damage.
Remaining polymer residues are often overlooked when interpreting the RS
characteristics of 2D material memristors. Here, we demonstrate that the
parasitic residues themselves can be the origin of RS. We emphasize the
necessity to fabricate appropriate reference structures and employ atomic-scale
material characterization techniques to properly evaluate the potential of 2D
materials as the switching layer in vertical memristors. Our
polymer-residue-based memristors exhibit RS typical for a filamentary mechanism
with metal ion migration, and their performance parameters are strikingly
similar to commonly reported 2D material memristors. This reveals that the
exclusive consideration of electrical data without a thorough verification of
material interfaces can easily lead to misinterpretations about the potential
of 2D materials for memristor applications.

<h3>Geometric density of states of electronic structures for local  responses: Phase information from the amplitudes of STM measurement</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electronic band structures underlie the physical properties of crystalline
materials, their geometrical exploration renovates the conventional cognition
and brings about novel applications. Inspired by geometry phases, we introduce
a geometric amplitude named as the geometric density of states (GDOS) dictated
by the differential curvature of the constant-energy contour. The GDOS
determines the amplitude of the real-space Green's function making it attain
the ultimate expression with transparent physics. The local responses of
crystalline materials are usually formulated by the real-space Green's
function, so the relevant physics should be refreshed by GDOS. As an example of
local responses, we suggest using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to
characterize the surface states of three-dimensional topological insulator
under an in-plane magnetic field. The GDOS favors the straightforward
simulation of STM measurement without resorting to Fourier transform of the
real-space measurement, and also excavates the unexplored potential of STM
measurement to extract the phase information of wavefunction through its
amplitude, i.e., the spin and curvature textures. Therefore, the proposed GDOS
deepens the understanding of electronic band structures and is indispensable in
local responses, and it should be universal for any periodic systems.

<h3>Exactly solvable subspaces of non-integrable spin chains with boundaries  and quasiparticle interactions</h3>

<i>Chihiro Matsui</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose two new strategies to construct a family of non-integrable spin
chains with exactly solvable subspace based on the idea of quasiparticle
excitations from the matrix product vacuum state. The first one allows the
boundary generalization, while the second one makes it possible to construct
the solvable subspace with interacting quasiparticles. Each generalization is
realized by removing the assumption made in the conventional method, which is
the frustration-free condition or the local orthogonality, respectively. We
found that the structure of embedded equally-spaced energy spectrum is not
violated by the diagonal boundaries, as log as quasiparticles are
non-interacting in the invariant subspace. On the other hand, we show that
there exists a one-parameter family of non-integrable Hamiltonians which show
perfectly embedded energy spectrum of the integrable spin chain. Surprisingly,
the embedded energy spectrum does change by varying the free parameter of the
Hamiltonian. The constructed eigenstates in the solvable subspace are the
candidates of quantum many-body scar states, as they show up in the middle of
the energy spectrum and have entanglement entropies expected to obey the
sub-volume law.

Colour centres in diamond are attractive candidates for numerous quantum
applications due to their good optical properties and long spin coherence
times. They also provide access to the even longer coherence of hyperfine
coupled nuclear spins in their environment. While the NV centre is well
studied, both in experiment and theory, the hyperfine couplings in the more
novel centres (SiV, GeV, and SnV) are still largely unknown. Here we report on
the first all-electron \textit{ab-initio} calculations of the hyperfine
constants for SiV, GeV, and SnV defects in diamond, both for the respective
defect atoms ($^{29}$Si, $^{73}$Ge, $^{117}$Sn, $^{119}$Sn), as well as for the
surrounding $^{13}$C atoms. Furthermore, we calculate the nuclear quadrupole
moments of the GeV defect. We vary the Hartree-Fock mixing parameter for
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional and show that the
hyperfine couplings of the defect atoms have a linear dependence on the mixing
percentage. We calculate the inverse dielectric constant to predict an
\textit{ab-initio} mixing percentage. The final hyperfine coupling predictions
are close to the experimental values available in the literature. Our results
will help to guide future novel experiments on these defects.

<h3>Signatures of spectral crossovers in the short- and long-range spectral  correlations of a disordered spin-chain with Kramers degeneracy</h3>

<br>
<i>Debojyoti Kundu, Santosh Kumar, Subhra Sen Gupta</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate several distinct spectral crossovers amongst various
integrable and quantum-chaotic limits of a 1D disordered quantum spin-1/2
model, by tuning the relative amplitudes of various Hamiltonian parameters to
retain or break relevant unitary and antiunitary symmetries. Since we are
specially interested in crossovers involving a Gaussian symplectic ensemble
(GSE) limit, we carry out all our calculations with an odd number of spins that
naturally results in eigenspectra with Kramers degeneracies. The various
crossovers are investigated via detailed studies of both short-range (NNSD) and
long-range (spectral rigidity and number variance) spectral correlations. The
short-range studies show excellent agreement with RMT predictions. One of the
highlights of this study is the systematic investigation of the consequences of
retaining both eigenvalues corresponding to every Kramers doublet, in a
crossover involving the GSE limit, and see how it evolves to a limit where the
KD is naturally lifted. The NNSD plot in the GSE limit exhibits a Dirac delta
peak at zero splitting and a renormalized GSE hump at finite splitting, whose
general analytical form is derived. With an increasing symmetry breaking
magnetic field the NNSD shows an interesting, dynamic two-peaked structure that
finally converges to the standard GUE lineshape. We explain this trend in terms
of a competition between the splittings amongst distinct Kramers doublets and
the Zeeman-like splittings induced by a breaking of time-reversal symmetry. In
the long-range spectral correlation studies, we shed light on the extent of
agreement between our physical spin systems and RMT predictions. Our studies
also show that the long-range correlations may serve to distinguish between the
two Poissonian limits (nonlocalized and localized) in the reentrant crossovers,
which the short-range correlations fail to distinguish.

<br>
Under the weak coupling, we investigate the critical temperatures under
pressure of H3S, LaH10, CaH6, and Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8+{\delta} superconductors. The
superconducting mechanism takes into account the electron-phonon interaction as
well as the Coulomb interaction. Under high pressure, the critical temperature
equation is calculated as a function of the fractional volume of the unit cell,
and the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state is used to determine the relationship
between fraction volume and pressure. Using this equation, we can analyze the
parabolic-like relationship between the critical temperature and pressure of a
superconductor. The parabolic behavior of these superconductors' critical
temperature versus pressure can fit well. The maximal critical temperature of
Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8+{\delta}, H3S, LaH10, and CaH6 superconductors are predicted to
be 112 K at 7 GPa, 197 K at 140 GPa, 252 K at 143 GPa, and 207 K at 174 GPa,

Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have recently gained increasing interest as
redox enzyme-mimetics to scavenge the intracellular excess of reactive oxygen
species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Despite the extensive exploration
of CNP scavenging activity, there remains a notable knowledge gap regarding the
fundamental mechanism underlying the CNP catalyzed disproportionation of H2O2.
In this Letter, we present evidence demonstrating that H2O2 adsorption at CNP
surface triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as ceriumperoxo
complexes (Ce-O2 2-). The cerium-peroxo complexes can be resolved by Raman
scattering and UV-Visible spectroscopy. We further demonstrate that the
catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the H2O2 disproportionation reaction increases
with the Ce(III) fraction. The developed approach using UV-Visible spectroscopy
for the characterization of Ce-O2 2-complexes can potentially serve as a
foundation for determining the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the
disproportionation of H2O2.

Gr\"uneisen relation into an effective version which includes the magnetic
counterpart to the volume change of internal energy. Based on the specific heat
and thermal conductivity from the elastic and magnetic origins we predicted the
dependency of observables, such as effective Gr\"uneisen parameter, thermal
expansion coefficient, and the damping factor, with respect to a wide range of
temperature across the phase transition. Our model of analysis as been
validated by applying to the case of FePS3 flake resonator and the theoretical
predictions fits well with the reported experiment data.

The Magnetoelectric Spin-Orbit (MESO) technology aims to bring logic into
memory by combining a ferromagnet with a magnetoelectric (ME) element for
information writing, and a spin-orbit (SO) element for information read-out
through spin-charge conversion. Among candidate SO materials to achieve a large
MESO output signal, oxide Rashba two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) have
shown very large spin-charge conversion efficiencies, albeit mostly in
spin-pumping experiments. Here, we report all-electrical spin-injection and
spin-charge conversion experiments in nanoscale devices harnessing the inverse
Edelstein effect of SrTiO3 2DEGs. We have designed, patterned and fabricated
nanodevices in which a spin current injected from a cobalt layer into the 2DEG
is converted into a charge current. We optimized the spin-charge conversion
signal by applying back-gate voltages, and studied its temperature evolution.
We further disentangled the inverse Edelstein contribution from spurious
effects such as the planar Hall effect, the anomalous Hall effect or the
anisotropic magnetoresistance. The combination of non-volatility and high
energy efficiency of these devices could potentially lead to new technology
paradigms for beyond-CMOS computing architectures.

The position operator in a Bloch representation acquires a gauge correction

orbital-dependent and thus plays a crucial role in the description of the
intrinsic orbital Hall effect in terms of Wannier basis. We demonstrate this
from the first-principles calculation of orbital Hall conductivities of
transition metals by Wannier interpolation. Our results show that consistent
treatment of the velocity operator by adding the additional term originating
from the anomalous position predicts the orbital Hall conductivities different
from those obtained by considering only the group velocity. We find the
difference is crucial in several metals. For example, we predict the negative
sign of the orbital Hall conductivities for elements in the groups X and XI
such as Cu, Ag, Au, and Pd, for which the previous studies predicted the
positive sign. Our work suggests the importance of consistently describing the
spatial dependence of basis functions by first-principles methods as it is
fundamentally missing in the tight-binding approximation.

In this work we present a discrete model that captures the fundamental
properties of additively manufactured solids in a minimal setting. The model is
based on simplified kinematics and allows for the onset of incompatible
deformations between discrete layers of an additively manufactured stack.
Thanks to the discrete nature of the model, we obtain an averaged formulation
of mechanical equilibrium for the growing stack, leading to closed-form
solutions that are both analytically simple and physically transparent. In
particular, we are able to explain the origin of residual stresses by the
accumulation of incompatible deformations between adjacent layers. At the same
time, we are able to formulate the technologically relevant inverse problem
that provides the deposition protocol required to produce a desired state of
internal stress in the manufactured stack. Another important aspect analyzed in
the work is the role played by an ideal ``glue'' between the layers, whose
presence is fundamental to prevent their sliding and whose mechanical behavior
can quantitatively influence the final stress distribution in the stack.
Although the model is an elementary approximation of additive manufacturing,
its simplicity makes it possible to highlight how the controls exerted during
deposition will have qualitative or quantitative effects on the final stress
state of the stack. This understanding is crucial in shedding light on the
complex mechanical behavior of additive manufactured solids.

<h3>Calculating the Circular Dichroism of Chiral Halide Perovskites: A  Tight-Binding Approach</h3>

Chiral metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising optoelectronic
materials for emission and detection of circular polarized visible light.
Despite chirality being realized by adding chiral organic cations or ligands,
the chiroptical activity originates from the metal halide framework. The
mechanism is not well understood, as an overarching modeling framework is
lacking. Capturing chirality requires going beyond electric dipole transitions,
the common approximation in condensed matter calculations. We present a density
functional theory (DFT) parameterized tight-binding (TB) model, which allows us
to calculate optical properties including circular dichroism (CD) at low
computational cost. Comparing Pb-based chiral perovskites with different
organic cations and halide anions, we find that the structural helicity within
the metal halide layers determines the size of the CD. Our results mark an
important step in understanding the complex correlations of structural,
electronic and optical properties of chiral perovskites, and provide a useful
tool to predict new compounds with desired properties for novel optoelectronic
applications.

<h3>Natural orbitals and their occupation numbers in a non-interacting  two-anyon system in the magnetic gauge</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the properties of natural orbitals and their occupation
numbers of the ground state of two non-interacting anyons characterised by the
fractional exchange parameter $\alpha$ and confined in a harmonic trap. We work
in the boson magnetic gauge where the anyons are modelled as composite bosons
with magnetic flux quanta attached to their positions. We derive an asymptotic
form of the weakly occupied natural orbitals, and show that their corresponding
(ordered descendingly) occupation numbers decay according to the power law
$n^{-(4+2\alpha)}$, where $n$ is the index of the natural orbital. We find
remarkable numerical agreement of the theory with the natural orbitals and
their occupation numbers computed from the spectral decomposition of the
system's wavefunction. We explain that the same results apply to the fermion
magnetic gauge.

<h3>Applicability and limitations of cluster perturbation theory for Hubbard  models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14035</a>
<br>
<i>Nicklas Enenkel, Markus Garst, Peter Schmitteckert</i>
<br>
<br>
We present important use cases and limitations when considering results
obtained from Cluster Perturbation Theory (CPT). CPT combines the solutions of
small individual clusters of an infinite lattice system with the Bloch theory
of conventional band theory in order to provide an approximation for the
Green's function in the thermodynamic limit. To this end we are investigating
single-band and multi-band Hubbard models in one- and two-dimensional systems.
A special interest is taken in the supposed pseudo gap regime of the
two-dimensional square lattice at half filling and intermediate interaction
strength ($U \leq 3t$) as well as the metal-insulator transition. We point out
that the finite-size level spacing of the cluster limits the resolution of
spectral features within CPT. This restricts the investigation of asymptotic
properties of the metal-insulator transition, as it would require much larger
cluster sizes that are beyond computational capabilities.

<h3>Making topologically trivial non-Hermitian systems non-trivial via gauge  fields</h3>

Non-Hermiticity significantly enriches the concepts of symmetry and topology
in physics. Particularly, non-Hermiticity gives rise to the ramified
symmetries, where the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $H$ is transformed to
$H^\dagger$. For time-reversal ($T$) and sublattice symmetries, there are six
ramified symmetry classes leading to novel topological classifications with
various non-Hermitian skin effects. As artificial crystals are the main
experimental platforms for non-Hermitian physics, there exists the symmetry
barrier for realizing topological physics in the six ramified symmetry classes:
While artificial crystals are in spinless classes with $T^2=1$, nontrivial
classifications dominantly appear in spinful classes with $T^2=-1$. Here, we
present a general mechanism to cross the symmetry barrier. With an internal
parity symmetry $P$, the square of the combination $\tilde{T}=PT$ can be
modified by appropriate gauge fluxes. Using the general mechanism, we
systematically construct spinless models for all non-Hermitian spinful
topological phases in one and two dimensions, which are experimentally
realizable. Our work suggests that gauge structures may significantly enrich
non-Hermitian physics at the fundamental level.

<h3>Long-range spectral statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter model</h3>

<br>
<i>Wouter Buijsman</i>
<br>
<br>
The Rosenzweig-Porter model is a single-parameter random matrix ensemble that
supports an ergodic, fractal, and localized phase. The names of these phases
refer to the properties of the (bulk) eigenstates. This work focuses on the
long-range spectral statistics of the recently introduced unitary equivalent of
this model. By numerically studying the Thouless time obtained from the
spectral form factor, it is argued that long-range spectral statistics can be
used to probe the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases.
Provided that the transition between the fractal and the localized phases can
be probed through short-range level statistics such as the average ratio of
consecutive level spacings, this work establishes that spectral statistics are
sufficient to probe both transitions present in the phase diagram.

<h3>Random-Energy Secret Sharing via Extreme Synergy</h3>

<br>
<i>Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn, David J. Schwab</i>
<br>
<br>
The random-energy model (REM), a solvable spin-glass model, has impacted an
incredibly diverse set of problems, from protein folding to combinatorial
optimization to many-body localization. Here, we explore a new connection to
secret sharing. We formulate a secret-sharing scheme, based on the REM, and
analyze its information-theoretic properties. Our analyses reveal that the
correlations between subsystems of the REM are highly synergistic and form the
basis for secure secret-sharing schemes. We derive the ranges of temperatures
and secret lengths over which the REM satisfies the requirement of secure
secret sharing. We show further that a special point in the phase diagram
exists at which the REM-based scheme is optimal in its information encoding.
Our analytical results for the thermodynamic limit are in good qualitative
agreement with numerical simulations of finite systems, for which the strict
security requirement is replaced by a tradeoff between secrecy and
recoverability. Our work offers a further example of information theory as a
unifying concept, connecting problems in statistical physics to those in
computation.

<br>
<i>Alex W. Robinson, Amirafshar Moshtaghpour, Jack Wells, Daniel Nicholls, Miaofang Chi, Ian MacLaren, Angus I. Kirkland, Nigel D. Browning</i>
<br>
<br>
Here we show that compressive sensing allow 4-dimensional (4-D) STEM data to
be obtained and accurately reconstructed with both high-speed and low fluence.
The methodology needed to achieve these results compared to conventional 4-D
approaches requires only that a random subset of probe locations is acquired
from the typical regular scanning grid, which immediately generates both higher
speed and the lower fluence experimentally. We also consider downsampling of
the detector, showing that oversampling is inherent within convergent beam
electron diffraction (CBED) patterns, and that detector downsampling does not
reduce precision but allows faster experimental data acquisition. Analysis of
an experimental atomic resolution yttrium silicide data-set shows that it is
possible to recover over 25dB peak signal-to-noise in the recovered phase using
0.3% of the total data.

<br>
<br>
Although in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of nanomaterials has
been gaining importance in recent years, difficulties in sample preparation
have limited the number of studies on electrical properties. Here, a
support-based preparation method of individual 1D and 2D materials is
presented, which yields a reproducible sample transfer for electrical
investigation by in-situ TEM. Using a mechanically rigid support grid allows
the reproducible transfer and contacting to in-situ chips by focused ion beam
with minimum damage and contamination. The transfer quality is assessed by
exemplary studies of different nanomaterials, including a monolayer of WS2.
Preliminary results from in-situ test experiments give an overview of possible
studies, which concern the interplay between structural properties and
electrical characteristics on the individual nanomaterial level as well as
failure analysis under electrical current or studies of electromigration, Joule
heating and related effects. The TEM measurements can be enriched by additional
correlative microscopy techniques, which allow the study with a spatial
resolution in the range of a few microns. Although developed for in-situ TEM,
the present transfer method is also applicable to transferring nanomaterials to
similar chips for performing further studies or even for using them in
potential electrical/optoelectronic/sensing devices.

Understanding the relaxation and recombination processes of excited states in
two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor heterojunctions is
essential for developing efficient optical and (opto)electronic devices which
integrate new 2D materials with more conventional 3D ones. In this work, we
unveil the carrier dynamics and charge transfer in a monolayer of WSe$_2$ on a
GaAs substrate. We use time-resolved differential reflectivity to study the
charge relaxation processes involved in the junction and how they change when
compared to an electrically decoupled heterostructure, WSe$_2$/hBN/GaAs. We
observe that the monolayer in direct contact with the GaAs substrate presents
longer optically-excited carrier lifetimes (3.5 ns) when compared with the
hBN-isolated region (1 ns), consistent with a strong reduction of radiative
decay and a fast charge transfer of a single polarity. Through low-temperature
measurements, we find evidence of a type-II band alignment for this
heterostructure with an exciton dissociation that accumulates electrons in the
GaAs and holes in the WSe$_2$. The type-II band alignment and fast
photo-excited carrier dissociation shown here indicate that WSe$_2$/GaAs is a
promising junction for new photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices,
making use of the best properties of new (2D) and conventional (3D)
semiconductors.

<h3>Spectral Crossovers and Universality in Quantum Spin-chains Coupled to  Random Fields</h3>

<br>
<i>Debojyoti Kundu, Santosh Kumar, Subhra Sen Gupta</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the spectral properties of and spectral-crossovers between different
random matrix ensembles (Poissonian, GOE, GUE) in correlated spin-chain
systems, in the presence of random magnetic fields, and the scalar
spin-chirality term, competing with the usual isotropic and time-reversal
invariant Heisenberg term. We have investigated these crossovers in the context
of the level-spacing distribution and the level-spacing ratio distribution. We
use random matrix theory (RMT) analytical results to fit the observed
Poissonian-to-GOE and GOE-to-GUE crossovers, and examine the relationship
between the RMT crossover parameter {\lambda} and scaled physical parameters of
the spin-chain systems in terms of a scaling exponent. We find that the
crossover behavior exhibits universality, in the sense that it becomes
independent of lattice size in the large Hamiltonian matrix dimension limit.

<h3>Second-order optical response of superconductors induced by supercurrent  injection</h3>

<br>
<i>Linghao Huang, Jing Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory of the nonlinear optical responses in superconducting
systems in the presence of a dc supercurrent. The optical transitions between
particle-hole pair bands across the superconducting gap are allowed in clean
superconductors as the inversion-symmetry-breaking by supercurrent. Vertex
correction is included in optical conductivity to maintain the $U(1)$ gauge
symmetry in the mean-field formalism, which contains the contributions from
collective modes. We show two pronounced current dependent peaks in the
second-order nonlinear optical conductivity $\sigma^{(2)}(\omega)$ at the gap
edge $2\hbar\omega=2\Delta$ and $\hbar\omega=2\Delta$, which diverge in the
clean limit. We demonstrate this in the models of single-band superconductor
with $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairings, and Dirac fermion systems with $s$-wave
pairing. Our theory predicts the current induced peak in
$\text{Im}[\sigma^{(2)}(\omega)]$ is proportional to square of the supercurrent
density in the $s$-wave single-band model, with the same order of magnitude as
the recent experimental observation of second-harmonic generation in NbN by
Nakamura et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 097004 (2020)]. The supercurrent induced
nonlinear optical spectroscopy provides a valuable toolbox to explore novel
superconductors.

<h3>Coulomb potential screening via charged carriers and charge-neutral  dipoles/excitons in two-dimensional case</h3>

<br>
<i>Ke Xiao, Chiming Kan, Xiaodong Cui</i>
<br>
<br>
With the shrink of dimensionality, Coulomb interaction displays a distinct
role owing to the reduced dielectric screening in out-of-plane direction. Apart
from the dielectric screening, the free charge carriers and/or dipoles can also
make nonnegligible contribution to Coulomb interaction. While the Thomas Fermi
model is effective in describing charge carrier screening in three dimensions,
the extent of screening to two-dimension resulting from charge-neutral dipoles
and carriers remains quantitatively unclear. To address this gap, we present a
simple analytical solution based on linear response theory, offering a
comprehensive depiction of the Coulomb screened potential in both 2D and 3D
systems, where screening effects from both charge carriers and charge-neutral
dipoles are addressed. Our work provides a handy tool for directly analysing
and evaluating Coulomb interaction strength in atomically thin materials and
particularly in the context of electronic and optoelectronic engineering. As a
demonstration, we utilize the derived modified Coulomb potential for the
exciton system to estimate the exciton binding energy variation arising from
exciton density fluctuation and the temperature dependent exciton
polarizability, yielding excellent agreement with the experimental and
computational findings.

<h3>Non-Hermitian Mott Skin Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14111" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14111</a>
<br>
<i>Tsuneya Yoshida, Song-Bo Zhang, Titus Neupert, Norio Kawakami</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a novel type of skin effects in non-Hermitian quantum many-body
systems which we dub a non-Hermitian Mott skin effect. This phenomenon is
induced by the interplay between strong correlations and the non-Hermitian
point-gap topology. The Mott skin effect induces extreme sensitivity to the
boundary conditions only in the spin degree of freedom (i.e., the charge
distribution is not sensitive to boundary conditions), which is in sharp
contrast to the ordinary non-Hermitian skin effect in non-interacting systems.
Concretely, we elucidate that a bosonic non-Hermitian chain exhibits the Mott
skin effect in the strongly correlated regime by closely examining an effective
Hamiltonian. The emergence of the Mott skin effect is also supported by
numerical diagonalization of the bosonic chain. The difference between the
ordinary non-Hermitian skin effect and the Mott skin effect is also reflected
in the time-evolution of physical quantities; under the time-evolution spin
accumulation is observed while the charge distribution remains spatially
uniform.

We construct two-band topological semimetals in four dimensions using the
unstable homotopy of maps from the three-torus $T^3$ (Brillouin zone of a 3D
crystal) to the two-sphere $S^2$. Dubbed ``Hopf semimetals'', these gapless
phases generically host nodal lines, with a surface enclosing such a nodal line
in the four-dimensional Brillouin zone carrying a Hopf flux. These semimetals
show a unique class of surface states: while some three-dimensional surfaces
host gapless Fermi-arc states {\em and} drumhead states, other surfaces have
gapless Fermi surfaces. Gapless two-dimensional corner states are also present
at the intersection of three-dimensional surfaces.

<br>
The non-equilibrium steady states of a semi-infinite quasi-one-dimensional
univalent binary electrolyte solution, characterised by non-vanishing electric
currents, are investigated by means of Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) theory.
Exact analytical expressions of the electric field, the charge density and the
number density are derived, which depend on the electric current density as a
parameter. From a non-equilibrium version of the Grahame equation, which
relates the total space charge per cross-sectional area and the corresponding
contribution of the electric potential drop, the current-dependent differential
capacitance of the diffuse layer is derived. In the limit of vanishing electric
current these results reduce to those within Gouy-Chapman theory. It is shown
that improperly chosen boundary conditions lead to non-equilibrium steady state
solutions of the PNP equations with negative ion number densities. A necessary
and sufficient criterion on surface conductivity constitutive relations is
formulated which allows one to detect such unphysical solutions.

Superconducting electrodes are an integral part of hybrid Josephson junctions
used in many applications including quantum technologies. We report on the
fabrication and characterization of superconducting hybrid Au/YBa2Cu3O7-x
(YBCO) electrodes on vicinal substrates. In these structures, superconducting
CuO2-planes face the gold film, resulting in a higher value and smaller
variation of the induced energy gap compared to the conventional Au/YBCO
electrodes based on films with the c-axis normal to the substrate surface.
Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe an energy gap of about 10-17
meV at the surface of the 15- nm-thick gold layer deposited in situ atop the
YBCO film. To study the origin of this gap, we fabricate nanoconstrictions from
the Au/YBCO heterostructure and measure their electrical transport
characteristics. The conductance of the nanoconstrictions shows a series of
dips due to multiple Andreev reflections in YBCO and gold providing clear
evidence of the superconducting nature of the gap in gold. We consider the
Au/YBCO electrodes to be a versatile platform for hybrid Josephson devices with
a high operating temperature.

We present a brief review of experimental and theoretical papers on studies
of electron transport and magnetic properties in manganese-based compounds
Mn$_2$YZ and Mn$_3$Z (Y = V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.; Z = Al, Ge, Sn, Si, Pt,

compounds, the states of a half-metallic ferromagnet and a spin gapless
semiconductor can arise with the realization of various magnetic states, such
as a ferromagnet, a compensated ferrimagnet, and a frustrated antiferromagnet.
Binary compounds Mn$_3$Z have the properties of a half-metallic ferromagnet and
a topological semimetal with a large anomalous Hall effect, spin Hall effect,
spin Nernst effect, and thermal Hall effect. Their magnetic states are also
very diverse: from a ferrimagnet and an antiferromagnet to a compensated
ferrimagnet and a frustrated antiferromagnet, as well as an antiferromagnet
with a kagome-type lattice. It has been demonstrated that the electronic and
magnetic properties of such materials are very sensitive to external influences
(temperature, magnetic field, external pressure), as well as the processing
method (cast, rapidly quenched, nanostructured, etc.). Knowledge of the
regularities in the behavior of the electronic and magnetic characteristics of
Mn$_2$YAl and Mn$_3$Z compounds can be used for applications in micro- and
nanoelectronics and spintronics.

<br>
<br>
The ferroelectric nematic phase (NF) is a recently discovered phase of matter
in which the orientational order of the conventional nematic liquid crystal
state is augmented with polar order. Atomistic simulations suggest that the
polar NF phase would be denser than conventional nematics owing to
contributions from polar order. Using an oscillating U-tube densitometer, we
obtain detailed temperature-dependent density values for a selection of
conventional liquid crystals with excellent agreement with earlier reports.
Having demonstrated the validity of our method, we then record density as a
function of temperature for M5, a novel room-temperature ferroelectric nematic
material. We present the first experimental density data for a NF material as
well as density data for a nematic that has not previously been reported. We
find that the room-temperature NF material shows a large (>1.3 g cm3) density
at all temperatures studied, with an increase in density at phase transitions.
The magnitude of the increase for the intermediate splay-ferroelectric nematic
(NX-NF) transition is an order of magnitude smaller than the isotropic-nematic
(I-N) transition. Present results may be typical of ferroelectric nematic
materials, potentially guiding material development, and is especially relevant
for informing ongoing studies into this emerging class of materials.

<h3>Ultrafast generation of nonthermal magnons in iron: Ab initio  parameterized calculations</h3>

<br>
<i>Markus Weißenhofer, Peter M. Oppeneer</i>
<br>
<br>
Ultrafast laser excitation of ferromagnetic metals gives rise to correlated,
highly non-equilibrium dynamics of electrons, spins and lattice, which are,
however, poorly described by the widely used three-temperature model (3TM).
Here, we develop a fully ab initio parameterized out-of-equilibrium theory
based on a quantum kinetic approach -- termed (N+2) temperature model -- that
describes magnon occupation dynamics due to electron-magnon scattering. We
apply this model to perform quantitative simulations on the ultrafast,
laser-induced generation of magnons in iron and demonstrate that on these
timescales the magnon distribution is non-thermal: predominantly high-energy
magnons are created, while the magnon occupation close to the center of the
Brillouin zone even decreases, due to a repopulation towards higher energy
states via a so-far-overlooked scattering term. Moreover, we show that the 3TM
can be derived from our model and compare it with our microscopic calculations.
In doing so, we demonstrate that the simple relation between magnetization and
temperature computed at equilibrium does not hold in the ultrafast regime and
that the 3TM greatly overestimates the demagnetization. Our ab
initio-parametrized calculations show that ultrafast generation of non-thermal
magnons provides a sizable demagnetization within 200 fs and, thus, emphasize
the importance of magnon excitations for the ultrafast demagnetization process.

<br>

We study the chiral symmetry breaking and metastability of confined nematic
lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (LCLC) with and without chiral dopants. The
isotropic-nematic coexistence phase of the LCLC renders two confining
geometries: sessile isotropic(I) droplets surrounded by the nematic(N) phase
and sessile nematic droplets immersed in the isotropic background. In the
achiral system with no dopants, LCLC's elastic anisotropy and topological
defects induce a spontaneous twist deformation to lower the energetic penalty
of splay deformation, resulting in spiral optical textures under crossed
polarizers both in the I-in-N and N-in-I systems. While the achiral system
exhibits both handednesses with an equal probability, a small amount of the
chiral dopant breaks the balance. Notably, in contrast to the homochiral
configuration of a chirally doped LCLC in bulk, the spiral texture of the
disfavored handedness appears with a finite probability both in the I-in-N and
N-in-I systems. Our director field model elucidates the boundary conditions and
energetics behind this chiral symmetry breaking and the metastability of the
director configuration having the disfavored handedness. This work sheds light
on design considerations in homochiral configurations under confinement.

The liquid to vapour transition can occur at unexpected conditions in
nanopores, opening the door to fundamental questions and new technologies. The
physics of boiling in confinement is progressively introduced, starting from
classical nucleation theory, passing through nanoscale effects, and terminating
to the material and external parameters which affect the boiling conditions.
The relevance of boiling in specific nanoconfined systems is discussed,
focusing on heterogeneous lyophobic systems, chromatographic columns, and ion

Weyl semimetals are characterised by pairs of topologically protected nodes
at which electronic bands cross and electrons attain a definite chirality. Due
to the chiral anomaly, the non-conservation of charges with given chirality,
the axion term appears in their effective electromagnetic action. We determine
how this affects the properties of time-reversal invariant Weyl {\it
superconductors} (SCs) in the London regime. For type II SCs we show that axion
coupling generates magnetic $B$-fields transverse to a vortex. Above a critical
axion coupling the vortex become unstable and a transition into a type I SC
follows. In this regime an applied $B$-field not only decays inside the SC
within the London penetration depth, but the axion coupling generates an
additional perpendicular magnetic field. Consequently the field inside the
superconductor progressively rotates away from the applied one when going into
the bulk. At a critical coupling the Meissner state breaks down. The novel
chiral SC state that then emerges has a periodically divergent susceptibility,
at which the winding of $B$ inside the superconductor jumps. Thus the axion
coupling leaves crisp experimentally observable signatures in Weyl SCs.

One of the fundamental effects of the laser-matter interaction is the
appearance of an induced transient magnetisation. While the underlying
phenomena differ in their microscopic origin and cover a diverse array of
materials, here we address a fundamental question about the possibility to
drive domain-wall dynamics on the femtosecond timescale of the exchange
interactions solely by longitudinal changes of the magnetic moments. We verify
the viability of this hypothesis in the case of a generic ferromagnetic system
described in the framework of the high-temperature micromagnetic model based on
the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation. The effect is investigated in a 1D model at
constant temperature as well as in a full micromagnetic framework considering
realistic laser-induced heating. Our results demonstrate that domain-wall
deformation in a femtosecond timeframe leads to the displacement of the wall on
a larger timescale up to nanoseconds accompanied by a release of excess energy
in the form of spin waves. The domain wall deformation leads to the appearance
of a magnetisation gradient across the wall which promotes the motion towards
the region consisting of spins with decreased magnetisation length. The total
displacement is enhanced at larger temperatures and smaller damping due to an
increase of the longitudinal relaxation time which ensures the longer presence
of the induced magnetisation gradient. We also demonstrate an enhanced domain
wall motion in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction attributed
to augmented magnonic torques. Our results are important towards the
understanding of ultrafast magnetism phenomena on the sub-picosecond timescale.

The response of metals and their microstructures under extreme dynamic
conditions can be markedly different from that under quasistatic conditions.
Traditionally, high strain rates and shock stresses are measured using
cumbersome and expensive methods such as the Kolsky bar or large spall
experiments. These methods are low throughput and do not facilitate
high-fidelity microstructure-property linkages. In this work, we combine two
powerful small-scale testing methods, custom nanoindentation, and laser-driven
micro-flyer shock, to measure the dynamic and spall strength of metals. The
nanoindentation system is configured to test samples from quasistatic to
dynamic strain rate regimes (10$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ to 10$^{+4}$ s$^{-1}$). The
laser-driven micro-flyer shock system can test samples through impact loading
between 10$^{+5}$ s$^{-1}$ to 10$^{+7}$ s$^{-1}$ strain rates, triggering spall
failure. The model material used for testing is Magnesium alloys, which are
lightweight, possess high-specific strengths and have historically been
challenging to design and strengthen due to their mechanical anisotropy. Here,
we modulate their microstructure by adding or removing precipitates to
demonstrate interesting upticks in strain rate sensitivity and evolution of
dynamic strength. At high shock loading rates, we unravel an interesting
paradigm where the spall strength of these materials converges, but the failure
mechanisms are markedly different. Peak aging, considered to be a standard
method to strengthen metallic alloys, causes catastrophic failure, faring much
worse than solutionized alloys. Our high throughput testing framework not only
quantifies strength but also teases out unexplored failure mechanisms at
extreme strain rates, providing valuable insights for the rapid design and
improvement of metals for extreme environments.

To overcome the challenges associated with poor temporal stability of
perovskite solar cells, methods are required that allow for fast iteration of
fabrication and characterisation, such that optimal device performance and
stability may be actively pursued. Currently, establishing the causes of
underperformance is both complex and time-consuming, and optimisation of device
fabrication thus inherently slow. Here, we present a means of computational
device characterisation of mobile halide ion parameters from room temperature
current-voltage (J-V) measurements only, requiring $\sim 2$ hours of
computation on basic computing resources. With our approach, the physical
parameters of the device may be reverse modelled from experimental J-V
measurements. In a drift-diffusion model, the set of coupled drift-diffusion
partial differential equations cannot be inverted explicitly, so a method for
inverting the drift-diffusion simulation is required. We show how Bayesian
Parameter Estimation (BPE) coupled with a drift-diffusion perovskite solar cell
model can determine the extent to which device parameters affect performance
measured by J-V characteristics. Our method is demonstrated by investigating
the extent to which device performance is influenced by mobile halide ions for
a specific fabricated device. The ion vacancy density $N_0$ and diffusion
coefficient $D_I$ were found to be precisely characterised for both simulated
and fabricated devices. This result opens up the possibility of pinpointing
origins of degradation by finding which parameters most influence device J-V
curves as the cell degrades.

<h3>Symmetry breaking and ascending in the magnetic kagome metal FeGe</h3>

Spontaneous symmetry breaking-the phenomenon where an infinitesimal
perturbation can cause the system to break the underlying symmetry-is a
cornerstone concept in the understanding of interacting solid-state systems. In
a typical series of temperature-driven phase transitions, higher temperature
phases are more symmetric due to the stabilizing effect of entropy that becomes
dominant as the temperature is increased. However, the opposite is rare but
possible when there are multiple degrees of freedom in the system. Here, we
present such an example of a symmetry-ascending phenomenon in a magnetic kagome
metal FeGe by utilizing neutron Larmor diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. In
the paramagnetic state at 460K, we confirm that the crystal structure is indeed
hexagonal kagome lattice. On cooling to TN, the crystal structure changes from
hexagonal to monoclinic with in-plane lattice distortions on the order of
10^(-4) and the associated splitting of the double degenerate phonon mode of
the pristine kagome lattice. Upon further cooling to TCDW, the kagome lattice
shows a small negative thermal expansion, and the crystal structure becomes
more symmetric gradually upon further cooling. Increasing the crystalline
symmetry upon cooling is unusual, it originates from an extremely weak
structural instability that coexists and competes with the CDW and magnetic
orders. These observations are against the expectations for a simple model with
a single order parameter, hence can only be explained by a Landau free energy
expansion that takes into account multiple lattice, charge, and spin degrees of
freedom. Thus, the determination of the crystalline lattice symmetry as well as
the unusual spin-lattice coupling is a first step towards understanding the
rich electronic and magnetic properties of the system and sheds new light on
intertwined orders where the lattice degree of freedom is no longer dominant.

The Thouless charge pump represents a transfer of electric charge through a
gapped one-dimensional system between its zero-dimensional boundaries under a
periodic change of a parameter. The value of the passed charged during a single
cycle is known to be a topological invariant. We construct an analogous
topological invariant that measures a pump of Hall conductance inside of
three-dimensional material between its two-dimensional boundaries.

There is extensive current interest about electronic topology in correlated
settings. In strongly correlated systems, contours of Green's function zeros
may develop in frequency-momentum space, and their role in correlated topology
has increasingly been recognized. However, whether and how the zeros contribute
to electronic properties is a matter of uncertainty. Here we address the issue
in an exactly solvable model for Mott insulator. We show that the Green's
function zeros contribute to several physically measurable correlation
functions, in a way that does not run into inconsistencies. In particular, the
physical properties remain robust to chemical potential variations up to the
Mott gap as it should be based on general considerations. Our work sets the
stage for further understandings on the rich interplay among topology, symmetry
and strong correlations.
