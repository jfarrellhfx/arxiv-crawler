<h3>Non-Gaussian displacement distributions in models of heterogeneous active particle dynamics</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02780v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02780v1</a>
<br>
<i>Elisabeth Lemaitre, Igor M. Sokolov, Ralf Metzler, Aleksei V. Chechkin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effect of randomly distributed diffusivities and speeds in two
models for active particle dynamics with active and passive fluctuations. We
demonstrate how non-Gaussian displacement distributions emerge in these models
in the long time limit, including Cauchy-type and exponential (Laplace) shapes.
Notably the resulting shapes of the displacement distributions with distributed
diffusivities for the active models considered here are in striking contrast to
passive diffusion models. For the active motion models our discussion points
out the differences between active- and passive-noise. Specifically, we
demonstrate that the case with active-noise is in nice agreement with measured
data for the displacement distribution of social amoeba.

<h3>Quantum local-equilibrium approach to dissipative hydrodynamics</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02544v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02544v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jol Mabillard, Pierre Gaspard</i>
<br>
<br>
The macroscopic hydrodynamic equations are derived for many-body systems in
the local-equilibrium approach, using the Schr\"odinger picture of quantum
mechanics. In this approach, statistical operators are defined in terms of
microscopic densities associated with the fundamentally conserved quantities
and other slow modes possibly emerging from continuous symmetry breaking, as
well as macrofields conjugated to these densities. Functional identities can be
deduced, allowing us to identify the reversible and dissipative parts of the
mean current densities, to obtain general equations for the time evolution of
the conjugate macrofields, and to establish the relationship to
projection-operator methods. The entropy production is shown to be nonnegative
by applying the Peierls-Bogoliubov inequality to a quantum integral fluctuation
theorem. Using the expansion in the gradients of the conjugate macrofields, the
transport coefficients are given by Green-Kubo formulas and the entropy
production rate can be expressed in terms of quantum Einstein-Helfand formulas,
implying its nonnegativity in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.
The results apply to multicomponent fluids and can be extended to condensed
matter phases with broken continuous symmetries.

<h3>Modern computational studies of the glass transition</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02206v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02206v1</a>
<br>
<i>Ludovic Berthier, David R. Reichman</i>
<br>
<br>
The physics of the glass transition and amorphous materials continues to
attract the attention of a wide research community after decades of effort.
Supercooled liquids and glasses have been studied numerically since the advent
of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in the last century. Computer
studies have greatly enhanced both experimental discoveries and theoretical
developments and constitute an active and continually expanding research field.
Our goal in this review is to provide a modern perspective on this area. We
describe the need to go beyond canonical methods to attack a problem that is
notoriously difficult in terms of time scales, length scales, and physical
observables. We first summarise recent algorithmic developments to achieve
enhanced sampling and faster equilibration using replica exchange methods,
cluster and swap Monte Carlo algorithms, and other techniques. We then review
some major recent advances afforded by these novel tools regarding the
statistical mechanical description of the liquid-to-glass transition as well as
the mechanical, vibrational and thermal properties of the glassy solid. We
finally describe some important challenges for future research.

<h3>Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory and current fluctuations in active lattice gases</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02124v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02124v1</a>
<br>
<i>Tal Agranov, Sunghan Ro, Yariv Kafri, Vivien Lecomte</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the current large deviations for a lattice model of interacting
active particles displaying a motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To do
this, we first derive the exact fluctuating hydrodynamics of the model in the
large system limit. On top of the usual Gaussian noise terms the theory also
presents Poissonian noise terms, that we fully account for. We find a dynamical
phase transition between flat density profiles and sharply phase-separated
traveling waves, and we derive the associated phase diagram together with the
large deviation function for all phases, including the one displaying MIPS. We
show how the results can be obtained using methods similar to those of
equilibrium phase separation, in spite of the nonequilibrium nature of the
problem.

<h3>Superconducting diode in a field-free superconductor/magnetic-dot nanostructure</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02078v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02078v1</a>
<br>
<i>Ji Jiang, M. V. Miloevi, Yong-Lei Wang, Zhi-Li Xiao, F. M. Peeters, Qing-Hu Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
A strong superconducting diode effect (SDE) is revealed in a thin
superconducting film periodically nanostructured with magnetic dots. The SDE is
caused by the current-activated dissipation mitigated by vortex-antivortex
pairs (VAPs), which periodically nucleate under the dots, move and annihilate
in the superconductor - eventually driving the system to the high-resistive
state. Inversing the polarity of the applied current destimulates the
nucleation of VAPs, the system remains superconducting up to far larger
currents, leading to the pronounced diodic response. Our dissipative
Ginzburg-Landau simulations detail the involved processes, and provide reliable
geometric and parametric ranges for the experimental realization of such a
non-volatile superconducting diode, which operates in absence of any applied
magnetic field while being fluxonic by design.

<h3>Quarter Magnetization Plateau of Triplet Spin Dimers in the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02795v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02795v1</a>
<br>
<i>Madalynn Marshall, Brianna R. Billingsley, Xiaojian Bai, Tai Kong, Huibo Cao</i>
<br>
<br>
The Shastry-Sutherland lattice, 2-dimensional orthogonal arrangement of the
spin dimers, has been realized in the magnetic semiconductor, BaNd2ZnS5. A
signature feature of Shastry-Sutherland lattice materials is fractional
magnetization plateaus, which often indicate novel quantum phases. Here we
report the quarter magnetization plateau from a single crystal of BaNd2ZnS5 by
neutron diffraction. A 2-Q antiferromagnetic order of the triplet spin dimers
was determined at zero-field, which can be understood by the local Ising
magnetic anisotropy of Nd spins that was revealed by local magnetic
susceptibility method through polarized neutron diffraction. The quantized
magnetization plateau was measured under field along (1-10). The two magnetic
sublattices connected to each propagation vector of 2-Q respond to the field
differently, the stripe phase with q1 = (0.5, 0.5, 0) disappears at ~1.7 T
entering the quarter magnetization plateau. The other stripe phase with q2=
(-0.5, 0.5, 0) remains nearly intact up to 6 T. Furthermore, microscopic
magnetic model was used to provide insight into the formation of quarter
magnetization plateau, that is unexpected in gapless dimer triplet system,
contrast to the well-known dimer-singlet Shastry-Sutherland lattice.

<br>
<br>
The performance of superconducting qubits is degraded by a poorly
characterized set of energy sources breaking the Cooper pairs responsible for
superconductivity, creating a condition often called "quasiparticle poisoning."
Recently, a superconductor with one of the lowest average quasiparticle
densities ever measured exhibited quasiparticles primarily produced in bursts
which decreased in rate with time after cooldown. Similarly, several cryogenic
calorimeters used to search for dark matter have also observed an unknown
source of low-energy phonon bursts that decrease in rate with time after
cooldown. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a
rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude
larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a
low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases
with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which
contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy
events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of
thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these
events, and conclude that stress relaxation contributes to quasiparticle
poisoning in superconducting qubits and the athermal phonon background in a
broad class of rare-event searches.

<br>
<br>
The increasing resistance of Cu interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a
major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7-nm
technology node as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption
in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at
surfaces and grain boundaries of the interconnects at the nanoscale.
Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states
and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising material candidates to
potentially replace current Cu interconnects as low-resistance interconnects.
Here, we report the attractive resistivity scaling of topological metal MoP
nanowires and show that the resistivity values are comparable to those of Cu
interconnects below 500 nm$^2$ cross-section areas. More importantly, we
demonstrate that the dimensional scaling of MoP nanowires, in terms of line
resistance versus total cross-sectional area, is superior to those of effective
Cu and barrier-less Ru interconnects, suggesting MoP is an attractive solution
to the current scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

<br>
<br>
We extend the highly-parallelizable open-source electronic transport code
TRANSEC to perform real-space atomic-scale electronic transport calculations
with periodic boundary conditions in the lateral dimensions. We demonstrate the
use of TRANSEC in periodic Cu and Rh bulk structures and in large periodic Rh
point contacts, in preparation to perform calculations of reflection
probability across Rh grain boundaries.

<br>

<br>
<br>
Non-hermitian systems have gained a lot of interest in recent years. However,
notions of chaos and localization in such systems have not reached the same
level of maturity as in the Hermitian systems. Here, we consider non-hermitian
interacting disordered Hamiltonians and attempt to analyze their chaotic
behavior or lack of it through the lens of the recently introduced
non-hermitian analog of the spectral form factor and the complex spacing ratio.
We consider three widely relevant non-hermitian models which are unique in
their ways and serve as excellent platforms for such investigations. Two of the
models considered are short-ranged and have different symmetries. The third
model is long-ranged, whose hermitian counterpart has itself become a subject
of growing interest. All these models exhibit a deep connection with the
non-hermitian Random Matrix Theory of corresponding symmetry classes at
relatively weak disorder. At relatively strong disorder, the models show the
absence of complex eigenvalue correlation, thereby, corresponding to Poisson
statistics. Our thorough analysis is expected to play a crucial role in
understanding disordered open quantum systems in general.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02757v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02757v1</a>
<br>
<i>Chi-Ming Chang, Jin Chen, Ken Kikuchi, Fengjun Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider topological defect lines (TDLs) in two-dimensional fermionic
conformal field theories (CFTs). Besides inheriting all the properties of TDLs
in bosonic CFTs, TDLs in fermionic CFTs could host fermionic defect operators
at their endpoints and junctions. Furthermore, there is a new type of TDLs,
called q-type TDLs, that have no analog in bosonic CFTs. Their distinguishing
feature is an extra one-dimensional Majorana fermion living on the worldline of
the TDLs. The properties of TDLs in fermionic CFTs are captured in the
mathematical language of the super fusion category. We propose a classification
of the rank-2 super fusion categories and explicitly construct all the
nontrivial ones. We derive the corresponding spin selection rules that
constrain the spectrum of the defect operators. Finally, we discuss a
constraint on the renormalization group flow that preserves a q-type TDL.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02749v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02749v1</a>
<br>
<i>kos Nagy, Steven Rayan</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent theoretical and experimental developments in the physics
of hyperbolic crystals, we study the noncommutative Bloch transform of Fuchsian
groups that we call the hyperbolic Bloch transform.
  First, we prove that the hyperbolic Bloch transform is injective and
"asymptotically unitary" already in the simplest case, that is when the Hilbert
space is the regular representation of the Fuchsian group, $\Gamma$. Second,
when $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{PSU} (1, 1)$ acts isometrically on the hyperbolic
plane, $\mathbb{H}$, and the Hilbert space is $L^2 \left( \mathbb{H} \right)$,
then we define a modified, geometric Bloch transform, that sends wave functions
to sections of stable, flat bundles over $\Sigma = \mathbb{H} / \Gamma$ and
transforms the hyperbolic Laplacian into the covariant Laplacian.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02739v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02739v1</a>
<br>
<i>Giacomo Mazza, Marco Schir</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the dissipative dynamics of a fermionic superfluid in presence of
two-body losses. We use a variational approach for the Lindblad dynamics and
obtain dynamical equations for Anderson's pseudo-spins where dissipation enters
as a complex pairing interaction as well as effective, density-dependent,
single particle losses which break the conservation of the pseudo-spin norm. We
show that this latter has key consequences on the dynamical behavior of the
system. In the case of a sudden switching of the two-body losses we show that
the superfluid order parameter decays much faster than then particle density at
short times and eventually slows-down, setting into a power-law decay at longer
time scales driven by the depletion of the system. We then consider a quench of
pairing interaction, leading to coherent oscillations in the unitary case,
followed by the switching of the dissipation. We show that losses wash away the
dynamical BCS synchronization by introducing not only damping but also a
renormalization of the frequency of coherent oscillations, which depends
strongly from the rate of two-body losses.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02731v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02731v1</a>
<br>
<i>Michele Grossi, Oriel Kiss, Francesco De Luca, Carlo Zollo, Ian Gremese, Antonio Mandarino</i>
<br>
<br>
The emergence of a collective behavior in a many-body system is responsible
of the quantum criticality separating different phases of matter. Interacting
spin systems in a magnetic field offer a tantalizing opportunity to test
different approaches to study quantum phase transitions. In this work, we
exploit the new resources offered by quantum algorithms to detect the quantum
critical behaviour of fully connected spin$-1/2$ models. We define a suitable
Hamiltonian depending on an internal anisotropy parameter $\gamma,$ that allows
us to examine three paradigmatic examples of spin models, whose lattice is a
fully connected graph. We propose a method based on variational algorithms run
on superconducting transmon qubits to detect the critical behavior for systems
of finite size. We evaluate the energy gap between the first excited state and
the ground state, the magnetization along the easy-axis of the system, and the
spin-spin correlations. We finally report a discussion about the feasibility of
scaling such approach on a real quantum device for a system having a dimension
such that classical simulations start requiring significant resources.

We report anisotropic magnetodielectric (MD) coupling in layered van der
Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic (AFM) FePS$_3$ (N\'eel temperature
$T_{\mathrm{N}}$ $\sim$ 120K) with perpendicular anisotropy. Above
$T_{\mathrm{N}}$, while dielectric response function along $c$-axis shows
frequency dependent relaxations, in-plane data is frequency independent and
reveals a deviation from phonon-anharmonicity in the ordered state, thereby
implying a connection to spin-phonon coupling known to be indicative of onset
of magnetic ordering. Significant positive out-of-plane magnetocapacitance
below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$, in contrast to a negative in-plane one, can be
attributed to the anisotropic spin-texture of FePS$_3$. At low temperature
(below 40 K), atypical anomaly in the dielectric constant is corroborated with
temperature dependent DC and AC susceptibility. This has been explained in
terms of the coexistence of different AFM orders, AFM-zigzag (AFM-z) and
AFM-N\'eel (AFM-N), as confirmed by $ab-initio$ calculations. Controlling
relative strength of magnetodielectric coupling with magnetic anisotropy opens
up a strategy for tailoring the magnetic ground state with potential
application to spintronic technologies.

<br>

We study why in quantum many-body systems the adiabatic fidelity and the
overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states have nearly
the same values in many cases. We elaborate on how the problem may be explained
by an interplay between the two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the
limit of small values of evolution parameter and the limit of large system
size. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a natural
explanation. In the latter case, a crucial observation is that pairs of vectors
lying in the complementary Hilbert space of the initial state are almost
orthogonal. Our general findings are illustrated with a driven Rice-Mele model,
a paradigmatic model of driven many-body systems.

The fractional quantum Hall effect in 2D electron gases submitted to large
magnetic fields remains one of the most striking phenomena in condensed matter
physics. Historically, the first observed signature is a Hall resistance
quantized to the value (2m+1) when the filling factor (electron density divided
by magnetic flux quantum density) of a 2D electron gas is in the vicinity of an
inverse odd integer 1/(2m +1). This was one of the first observation of
fractional quantum numbers. A large part of our basic theoretical understanding
of this effect (and descendants) originates from Laughlin's theory of 1983,
reviewed here from a mathematical physics perspective. We explain in which
sense Laughlin's proposed ground and excited states for the system are
rigid/incompressible liquids, and why this is crucial for the explanation of
the effect.

We study critical phenomena at a tricritical point associated with a chiral
phase transition which emerges in the D3/D7 model in the presence of a finite
baryon number density and an external magnetic field. We numerically determine
critical exponents related to the thermodynamic quantities and correlation
functions. We find that the values of the critical exponents agree with the
mean-field values. The scaling relations between the critical exponents are
satisfied, implying that the scaling hypothesis for the free energy and the
correlation functions hold. Our results indicate that the critical phenomena at
the tricritical point in the D3/D7 model are well described in the Landau
theory.

<br>
High entropy materials (HEMs) are of great interest for their mechanical,
chemical and electronic properties. In this paper we analyse (TaNbHfTiZr)C, a
carbide type of HEM, both in crystalline and amorphous phases, using density
functional theory (DFT). We find that the relaxed lattice volume of the
amorphous phase is larger, while its bulk modulus is lower, than that of its
crystalline counterpart. Both phases are metallic with all the transition
metals contributing similarly to the density of states (DOS) close to the Fermi
level, with Ti and Nb giving the proportionally largest contribution of states.
We confirm that despite its great structural complexity, 2x2x2 supercells are
large enough for reliable simulation of the presented mechanical and electronic
properties by DFT.

<br>
Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes are widely used, e.g. in
modern automotive and consumer applications, and require signal stability and
accuracy in rather harsh environmental conditions. In many use cases, device
reliability must be guaranteed under large external loads at high frequencies.
The sensitivity of the sensor to such external loads depends strongly on the
damping, or rather quality factor, of the high frequency mechanical modes of
the structure. In this paper, we investigate the influence of thermoelastic
damping on several high frequency modes by comparing finite element simulations
with measurements of the quality factor in an application-relevant temperature
range. We measure the quality factors over different temperatures in vacuum, to
extract the relevant thermoelastic material parameters of the polycrystalline
MEMS device. Our simulation results show a good agreement with the measured
quantities, therefore proving the applicability of our method for predictive
purposes in the MEMS design process. Overall, we are able to uniquely identify
the thermoelastic effects and show their significance for the damping of the
high frequency modes of an industrial MEMS gyroscope. Our approach is generic
and therefore easily applicable to any mechanical structure with many possible
applications in nano- and micromechanical systems.

The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction mediates collinear
magnetic interactions via the conduction electrons of a non-magnetic spacer,
resulting in a ferro- or antiferromagnetic magnetization in magnetic
multilayers. The resulting spin-polarized charge transport effects have found
numerous applications. Recently it has been discovered that heavy non-magnetic
spacers are able to mediate an indirect magnetic coupling that is non-collinear
and chiral. This Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-enhanced RKKY (DME-RKKY) interaction
causes the emergence of a variety of interesting magnetic structures, such as
skyrmions and spin spirals. Applications using these magnetic quasi-particles
require a thorough understanding and fine-tuning of the balance between the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and other magnetic interactions, e.g., the
exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropy contributions. Here, we show by
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy that the spin structure of
manganese oxide chains on Ir(001) can reproducibly be switched from chiral to
collinear antiferromagnetic interchain interactions by increasing the oxidation
state of MnO$_2$ while the reverse process can be induced by thermal reduction.
The underlying structural change is revealed by low-energy electron diffraction
intensity data (LEED-IV) analysis. Density functional theory calculations
suggest that the magnetic transition may be caused by a significant increase of
the Heisenberg exchange upon oxidation.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we propose a compact integrated hybrid plasmonic-photonic
device for optical reading of nanoscale magnetic bits with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy in a magnetic racetrack on top of a photonic waveguide on
the indium phosphide membrane on silicon platform. The hybrid device is
constructed by coupling a doublet of V-shaped gold plasmonic nanoantennas on
top of the indium phosphide waveguide. By taking advantage of the localized
surface plasmons, our hybrid device can enable detection of the magnetization
state in magnetic bits beyond the diffraction limit of light and enhance the
polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (PMOKE). We further illustrate how combining
the hybrid device with a plasmonic polarization rotator provides
magneto-optical read-out by transforming the PMOKE-induced polarization change
into an intensity variation of the waveguide mode. According to the simulation
results based on a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, the
hybrid device can detect the magnetization states in targeted bits in a
magnetic racetrack medium down to ~ 100x100 nm2, regardless of the
magnetization state of the rest of the racetrack with a relative intensity
contrast of greater than 0.5% for a ~ 200x100 nm2 magnetic bit. We believe our
hybrid device can be an enabling technology that can connect integrated
photonics with nanoscale spintronics, paving the way toward ultrafast and
energy efficient advanced on-chip applications.

<br>

<br>
<br>
The macroscopic hydrodynamic equations are derived for many-body systems in
the local-equilibrium approach, using the Schr\"odinger picture of quantum
mechanics. In this approach, statistical operators are defined in terms of
microscopic densities associated with the fundamentally conserved quantities
and other slow modes possibly emerging from continuous symmetry breaking, as
well as macrofields conjugated to these densities. Functional identities can be
deduced, allowing us to identify the reversible and dissipative parts of the
mean current densities, to obtain general equations for the time evolution of
the conjugate macrofields, and to establish the relationship to
projection-operator methods. The entropy production is shown to be nonnegative
by applying the Peierls-Bogoliubov inequality to a quantum integral fluctuation
theorem. Using the expansion in the gradients of the conjugate macrofields, the
transport coefficients are given by Green-Kubo formulas and the entropy
production rate can be expressed in terms of quantum Einstein-Helfand formulas,
implying its nonnegativity in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.
The results apply to multicomponent fluids and can be extended to condensed
matter phases with broken continuous symmetries.

<br>
<br>
The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect gives rise to strongly
spin-dependent transport through many organic molecules and structures. Its
discovery raises fascinating fundamental questions as well as the prospect of
possible applications. The basic phenomenology, a strongly asymmetric
magnetoresistance despite the absence of magnetism, is now understood to result
from the combination of spin-orbit coupling and chiral geometry. However,
experimental signatures of electronic helicity were observed at room
temperature, i.e., at an energy scale that exceeds the typical spin-orbit
coupling in organic systems by several orders of magnitude. This work shows
that a new energy scale for CISS emerges for currents carried by polarons,
i.e., in the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling. In particular, we
found that polaron fluctuations play a crucial role in the two manifestations
of CISS in transport measurements -- the spin-dependent transmission
probability through the system and asymmetric magnetoresistance.

<i>Guoyang Fu, Huajie Gong, Peng Liu, Xiao-Mei Kuang, Jian-Pin Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the properties of charge transport in a novel holographic QPT
(quantum phase transition) model, which has two different metallic phases: the
normal metallic phase and the novel metallic one. We numerically work out the
scaling behaviors of DC (direct current) resistivity at low temperatures in
both different metallic phases. The numerical results are solidly in agreement
with the analytical ones determined by the near horizon geometry. Then, we
mainly explore the properties of the low-frequency AC (alternating current)
conductivity. A remarkable characteristic is that the normal metallic phase is
a coherent system with vanishing intrinsic conductivity $\sigma_Q$, which is
independent of the strength of the momentum dissipation. This result is in
contrast with the common belief that with the strength of the momentum
dissipation increasing, the system changes from a coherent phase to an
incoherent one. But the novel metallic phase is an incoherent system with
non-vanishing $\sigma_Q$. Away from the QCP (quantum critical point),
$\sigma_Q$ increases, which indicates that the incoherent behavior becomes
stronger.

Easy axis antiferromagnets are robust against external magnetic fields of
moderate strength. Spin reorientations in strong fields can provide an insight
into more subtle properties of antiferromagnetic materials, which are often
hidden by their high ground state symmetry. Here, we investigate theoretically
effects of curvature in ring-shaped antiferromagnetic achiral anisotropic spin
chains in strong magnetic fields. We identify the geometry-governed
helimagnetic phase transition above the spin-flop field between vortex and
onion states. The curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results
in the spin-flop transition being of first- or second-order depending on the
ring curvature. Spatial inhomogeneity of the N\'eel vector in the spin-flop
phase generates weak ferromagnetic response in the plane perpendicular to the
applied magnetic field. Our work contributes to the understanding of the
physics of curvilinear antiferromagnets in magnetic fields and guides
prospective experimental studies of geometrical effects relying on
spin-chain-based nanomagnets.

Consider a discrete one-dimensional random surface whose height at a point
grows as a function of the heights at neighboring points plus an independent
random noise. Assuming that this function is equivariant under constant shifts,
symmetric in its arguments, and at least six times continuously differentiable
in a neighborhood of the origin, we show that as the variance of the noise goes
to zero, any such process converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the 1D KPZ
equation under a suitable scaling of space and time. This proves an invariance
principle for the 1D KPZ equation, in the spirit of Donsker's invariance
principle for Brownian motion.

Graphene can be turned into a semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry by
adding a valley-dependent pseudo-scalar potential that shifts the Dirac point
energies in opposite directions, as in the modified Haldane model. We consider
a bilayer obtained by stacking two time-reversed copies of the modified Haldane
model, where conduction and valence bands cross to give rise to a nodal line in
each valleys. In the AB stacking, the interlayer hopping lifts the degeneracy
of the nodal lines and induces a band repulsion, leading surprisingly to a
chiral insulator with a Chern number $C=\pm2$. As a consequence a pair of
chiral edge states appears at the boundaries of the ribbon bilayer geometry. In
contrast, the AA stacking does not show nontrivial topological phases. We
discuss possible experimental implementations of our results.

<br>
We demonstrate an electric field control of anomalous Hall effect emerging in
CaIrO$_3$/CaMnO$_3$ heterostructures. We fabricate both electron-type and
hole-type carrier samples by tuning epitaxial strain and then control the
carrier density in CaIrO$_3$ layer via electric double layer gating technique.
As the Fermi energy of CaIrO$_3$ is tuned close to the Dirac line node,
anomalous Hall conductivity is enlarged in both carrier-type samples. This
result reveals that the anomalous Hall effect comes from the intrinsic origin
reflecting the Dirac like dispersion in CaIrO$_3$. We propose that band
splitting induced by the interface ferromagnetism yields several band crossing
points near the Dirac line node. These points play as a source of the Berry
curvature and contribute to the anomalous Hall effect.

We study the average density of $N$ spinless noninteracting fermions in a
$2d$ harmonic trap rotating with a constant frequency $\Omega$ and in the
presence of an additional repulsive central potential $\gamma/r^2$. The average
density at zero temperature was recently studied in Phys. Rev. A
$\textbf{103}$, 033321 (2021) and an interesting multi-layered "wedding cake"
structure with a "hole" at the center was found for the density in the large
$N$ limit. In this paper, we study the average density at finite temperature.
We demonstrate how this "wedding-cake" structure is modified at finite
temperature. These large $N$ results warrant going much beyond the standard
Local Density Approximation. We also generalize our results to a wide variety
of trapping potentials and demonstrate the universality of the associated
scaling functions both in the bulk and at the edges of the "wedding-cake".

The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model still represents the paradigm for the
description of the competition in population dynamics. Despite its extreme
simplicity, it does not admit an analytical solution, and for this reason,
numerical integration methods are usually adopted to apply it to various fields
of science. The aim of the present work is to investigate the existence of new
predator-prey models sharing the broad features of the standard Lotka-Volterra
model and, at the same time, offer the advantage of possessing exact analytical
solutions. To this purpose, a general Hamiltonian formalism, which is suitable
for treating a large class of predator-prey models in population dynamics
within the same framework, has been developed as a first step. The only
existing model having the property of admitting a simple exact analytical
solution, is identified within the above class of models. The solution of this
special predator-prey model is obtained explicitly, in terms of known
elementary functions, and its main properties are studied. Finally, the
generalization of this model, based on the concept of power-law competition, as
well as its extension to the case of $N$-component competition systems, are
considered.

AMn6Bi5 materials (A = Na, K, Rb and Cs) consisting of unique Mn-cluster
chains emerge as a new family of superconductors with the suppression of their
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order under high pressures. Here, we report transverse
incommensurate spin density waves (SDWs) for the Mn atoms with a propagating
direction along the chain axes as a ground state for KMn6Bi5 by single crystal
neutron diffraction. The SDWs have a refined amplitude of ~2.46 Bohr magnetons
for the Mn atoms in the pentagons and ~0.29 Bohr magnetons with a large
standard deviation for Mn atoms in the center between the pentagons. AFM
dominate both the nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn interactions within the pentagon and
next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn interactions out of the pentagon (along the
propagating wave). The SDWs exhibit both local and itinerant characteristics
probably formed by a cooperative interaction between local magnetic exchange
and conduction electrons. A significant magnetoelastic effect during the AFM
transition, especially along the chain direction, has been demonstrated by
temperature-dependent x-ray powder diffraction. Single crystal x-ray
diffraction below the AFM transition revealed satellite peaks originating from
charge density waves along the chain direction with a q-vector twice as large
as the SDW one, pointing to a strong real space coupling between them. Our work
not only manifests a fascinating interplay among spin, charge, lattice and one
dimensionality to trigger intertwined orders in KMn6Bi5 but also provides
important piece of information for the magnetic structure of the parent
compound to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in this new family.

from 10 nm to 10 nm. k value of ZnTe is also observed to decrease from 10 W/mK
to 1.2 W/mK for the same decrease in length. We also measure the k of bulk ZnSe
and ZnTe using Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) technique and observed
a good agreement between FDTR measurements and first principles calculations

In phase transition dynamics involving symmetry breaking, topological defects
can be spontaneously created but it is suppressed in a spatially inhomogeneous
system due to the spreading of the ordered phase information. We demonstrate
the defect suppression effect in a trapped atomic Bose gas which is quenched
into a superfluid phase. The spatial distribution of created defects is
measured for various quench times and it is shown that for slower quenches, the
spontaneous defect production is relatively more suppressed in the sample's
outer region with higher atomic density gradient. The power-law scaling of the
local defect density with the quench time is enhanced in the outer region,
which is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism including the causality
effect due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the system. This work opens an
avenue in the study of nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics using the
defect position information.

By performing P doping on the Si sites in the topological semimetal
Mo$_5$Si$_3$, we discover strong-coupling superconductivity in
Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$ (0.5 $\le$ $x$ $\le$ 2.0). Mo$_5$Si$_3$ crystallizes in
the W$_5$Si$_3$-type structure with space group of $I4/mcm$ (No. 140), and is
not a superconductor itself. Upon P doping, the lattice parameter $a$ decreases
while $c$ increases monotonously. Bulk superconductivity is revealed in
Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$ (0.5 $\le$ $x$ $\le$ 2.0) from resistivity,
magnetization, and heat capacity measurements. $T_c$ in
Mo$_5$Si$_{1.5}$P$_{1.5}$ reaches as high as 10.8 K, setting a new record among
the W$_5$Si$_3$-type superconductors. The upper and lower critical fields for
Mo$_5$Si$_{1.5}$P$_{1.5}$ are 14.56 T and 105 mT, respectively. Moreover,
Mo$_5$Si$_{1.5}$P$_{1.5}$ is found to be a fully gapped superconductor with
strong electron-phonon coupling. First-principles calculations suggest that the
enhancement of electron-phonon coupling is possibly due to the shift of the
Fermi level, which is induced by electron doping. The calculations also reveal
the nontrivial band topology in Mo$_5$Si$_3$. The $T_c$ and upper critical
field in Mo$_5$Si$_{3-x}$P$_x$ are fairly high among pseudobinary compounds.
Both of them are higher than those in NbTi, making future applications
promising. Our results suggest that the W$_5$Si$_3$-type compounds are ideal
platforms to search for new superconductors. By examinations of their band
topologies, more candidates for topological superconductors can be expected in
this structural family.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the thermodynamic, magnetic, and electrical transport
properties of a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet EuZnGe using single crystals
grown from Eu-Zn flux in sealed tantalum tubes. Magnetic properties are found
to be isotropic in the paramagnetic state while we observe an enhancement of
in-plane magnetic susceptibility at the temperature near T* =11.3 K, suggesting
an easy-plane anisotropy at low temperatures. Magnetic transition temperature
is lower than T* as specific heat shows a peak at TN =7.6 K. We reveal the
magnetic modulation along the c axis by resonant x-ray scattering at Eu L2
edge, which suggests competing magnetic interaction among Eu triangular-lattice
layers. We observe a double-peak structure in the intensity profile along (0,
0, L) below TN, which is mainly composed of a dominant helical modulation with
q ~ (0, 0, 0.4) coexisting with a secondary contribution from q ~ (0, 0, 0.5).
We reproduce the intensity profile with a random mixture of five- and
four-sublattice helices with spin rotation skipping due to hexagonal in-plane
anisotropy. The metallic conductivity is highly anisotropic with the ratio
rho_zz/rho_xx exceeding 10 over the entire temperature range and additionally
exhibits a sharp enhancement of rho_zz at TN giving rise to rho_zz/rho_xx ~ 50,
suggesting a coupling between out-of-plane electron conduction and the spiral
magnetic modulations. In-plane magnetic field induces a spin-flop like
transition, where the q = 0.4 peak disappears and an incommensurate peak of
approximately qICM ~ 0.47 emerges, while the q = 0.5 modulation retains a
finite intensity. This transition correlates with non-monotonic
magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity, suggesting a significant interplay
between electrons and spin structures through Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
(RKKY) interaction.

<br>
The ability to prepare a macroscopic mechanical resonator into a quantum
superposition state is an outstanding goal of cavity optomechanics. Here we
propose a technique to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of motion using the
intrinsic nonlinearity of a dispersive optomechanical interaction. By applying
a bichromatic drive to an optomechanical cavity, our protocol enhances the
inherent second-order processes of the system, inducing the requisite
two-phonon dissipation. We show that this nonlinear sideband cooling technique
can dissipatively engineer a mechanical resonator into a Schr\"odinger cat
state, which we verify using the full Hamiltonian and an adiabatically reduced
model. While the fidelity of the cat state is maximized in the single-photon,
strong-coupling regime, we demonstrate that Wigner negativity persists even for
weak coupling. Finally, we show that our cat state generation protocol is
robust to significant thermal decoherence of the mechanical mode, indicating
that such a procedure may be feasible for near-term experimental systems.

Graphene's linear bandstructure and two-dimensional density of states provide
an implicit advantage for sensing charge. Here, these advantages are leveraged
in a deeply depleted graphene-oxide-semiconductor (D2GOS) junction detector
architecture to sense carriers created by ionizing radiation. Specifically, the
room temperature response of the silicon-based D2GOS junction is analyzed
during irradiation with 20 MeV Si4+ ions. Detection was demonstrated for doses
ranging from 12-1200 ions with device functionality maintained with no
substantive degradation. To understand the device response, D2GOS pixels were
characterized post-irradiation via a combination of electrical
characterization, Raman spectroscopy, and photocurrent mapping. This combined
characterization methodology underscores the lack of discernible damage caused
by irradiation to the graphene while highlighting the nature of interactions
between the incident ions and the silicon absorber.

<br>
<i>Benjamin Cohen-Stead, Kipton Barros, Richard Scalettar, Steven Johnston</i>
<br>
<br>
The role of electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions and their relationship to
charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the bismuthate family of high-temperature
superconductors remains unresolved. We address this question using
state-of-the-art nonperturbative hybrid quantum Monte Carlo calculations for
the parent compound BaBiO$_3$. Our model includes the Bi $6s$ and O $2p_\sigma$
orbitals and coupling to the Bi-O bond-stretching branch of optical phonons via
the modulation of the Bi-O hopping integral. Using recently proposed algorithms
that are fast and scalable, we perform simulations on large three-dimensional
clusters of up to 4000 orbitals, with input model parameters taken directly
from $\textit{ab initio}$ electronic structure calculations and a physically
motivated phonon energy $\hbar\Omega_0 = 60 \ {\rm meV}$. Our results
demonstrate that the coupling to the bond-stretching modes is sufficient to
account for the CDW transition in this system, despite the relatively small
dimensionless coupling to this branch predicted by density functional theory.
We also find that the transition deviates from the weak-coupling Peierls
picture, despite the noninteracting Fermi surface being well-nested at the CDW
ordering vector. Our results highlight the richness of $e$-ph interactions that
are off-diagonal in orbital space and suggest that such interactions play a
crucial role in establishing the bismuthate phase diagram.

<br>

<br>
<br>
Bloch electrons in multiorbital systems carry quantum geometric information
characteristic of their wavevector-dependent interorbital mixing. The geometric
nature impacts electromagnetic responses, and this effect carries over to the
superconducting state, which receives a geometric contribution to the
superfluid weight. In this paper, we show that this contribution could become
negative under appropriate circumstances, and that a more striking scenario
occurs in the narrow- or flat-band limit, where the geometric contribution
could overcome the conventional contribution to produce an overall negative
superfluid weight. This paves the way for the stabilization of a Cooper pairing
that favors real space phase modulation, i.e. the pair density wave order, as
we demonstrate through mean-field two-orbital model calculations. The quantum
geometric effect therefore constitutes an intrinsic mechanism for the formation
of pair density wave states in the absence of external magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
The interplay between the Kondo-screening of quantum impurities (by the
electronic channels to which they couple) and the inter-impurity RKKY
interactions (mediated by the same channels) has been extensively studied.
However, the effect of uni-directional channels (e.g., chiral or helical edge
modes of 2D topological materials) which greatly restrict the mediated
inter-impurity interactions, has only more recently come under scrutiny, and it
can drastically alter the physics. Here we take Wilson's Numerical
Renormalization Group (NRG), the most established numerical method for treating
quantum impurity models, and extend it to systems consisting of two impurities
coupled at different locations to uni-directional channel(s). This is
challenging due to the incompatibility of uni-directionality with one of the
main ingredients in NRG -- the mapping of the channel(s) to a Wilson chain -- a
tight-binding chain with the impurity at one end and hopping amplitudes which
decay exponentially with the distance. We bridge this gap by introducing a
"Wilson ladder" consisting of two coupled Wilson chains, and demonstrate that
this construction successfully captures the uni-directionality of the
channel(s), as well as the distance between the two impurities. We use this
mapping in order to study two Kondo impurities coupled to a single chiral
channel, demonstrating that all local properties and thermodynamic quantities
are indifferent to the impurity distance, and correspond to two separate
single-impurity models. Extensions to more impurities and/or helical channels
are possible.

lattice of optical waveguides fabricated by femtosecond laser writing. We
employ a Kerr nonlinearity in which self-focusing gives rise to spatial lattice
solitons. Our photonic system constitutes a powerful platform where the
interplay of time-periodic driving, topology and nonlinearity can be probed in
a highly tunable way.

<br>
<i>Pol Alonso-Cuevillas Ferrer, Oleg M. Yevtushenko, Andreas Weichselbaum</i>
<br>
<br>
Two spatially separated magnetic impurities coupled to itinerant electrons
give rise to a dynamically generated exchange (RKKY) inter-impurity interaction
that competes with the individual Kondo screening of the impurities. It has
been recently shown by Yevtushenko and Yudson (2018), that the RKKY interaction
and the RKKY vs. Kondo competition become nontrivial on helical edges of
two-dimensional topological insulators where there is lock-in relation between
the electron spin and its direction of motion. Kondo screening always takes
over and dominates at large inter-impurity distances and it can also dominate
all the way to short distances if the Kondo coupling is sufficiently large and
anisotropic. In the present paper, we study the Kondo-RKKY competition in
detail on a qualitative and quantitative level. For this we employ the
numerically exact numerical renormalization group (NRG) for a broad parameter
scan of two Kondo coupled impurities vs. magnetic anisotropy, impurity distance
and temperature, and comment on the role of finite bandwidth. We give a
pedagogical introduction on the the setup of the two-impurity setting within
the NRG in the helical context. Overall we establish a plain crossover from
RKKY to Kondo with increasing impurity distance which permits an intuitive
physical picture by simply comparing length scales set by the Kondo screening
cloud, the thermal length scale vs. the impurity distance.

<br>
<i>M. Lencss, G. Mussardo, G. Takcs</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the decay of the false vacuum in the scaling Ising and tricritical
Ising field theories using the Truncated Conformal Space Approach and compare
the numerical results to theoretical predictions in the thin wall limit. In the
Ising case, the results are consistent with previous studies on the quantum
spin chain and the $\varphi^4$ quantum field theory; in particular we confirm
that while the theoretical predictions get the dependence of the bubble
nucleation rate on the latent heat right, they are off by a model dependent
overall coefficient. The tricritical Ising model allows us on the other hand to
examine more exotic vacuum degeneracy structures, such as three vacua or two
asymmetric vacua, which leads us to study several novel scenarios of false
vacuum decay by lifting the vacuum degeneracy using different perturbations.

<br>
<i>Jinchen Zhao, Myung-Joong Hwang</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a one-dimensional Dicke lattice with complex photon hopping
amplitudes and investigate the influence of time-reversal symmetry breaking due
to synthetic magnetic fields. We show that, by tuning the total flux threading
the loop, the universality class of superradiant phase transition (SPT) changes
from that of the mean-field fully-connected systems to one that features
anomalous critical phenomena. The anomalous SPT exhibits a closing of the
energy gap with different critical exponents on both sides of transition and a
discontinuity of correlations and fluctuation despite it being a continuous
phase transition. In the anomalous normal phase, we find that a non-mean-field
critical exponent for the closing energy gap and non-divergent fluctuations and
correlations appear, which we attribute to the asymmetric dispersion relation.
Moreover, we show that the nearest neighborhood complex hopping induces
effective long-range interactions for position quadratures of the cavity
fields, whose competition leads to a series of first-order phase transitions
among superradiant phases with varying degrees of frustration. The resulting
multicritical points also show anomalous features such as two coexisting
critical scalings on both sides of the transition. Our work shows that the
interplay between the broken time-reversal symmetry and frustration on bosonic
lattice systems can give rise to anomalous critical phenomena that have no
counterpart in fermionic or spin systems or time-reversal symmetric quantum
optical systems.

Learning the properties of dynamical quantum systems underlies applications
ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantum device
characterization. A central challenge in this pursuit is the learning of
strongly-interacting systems, where conventional observables decay quickly in
time and space, limiting the information that can be learned from their
measurement. In this work, we introduce a new class of observables into the
context of quantum learning -- the out-of-time-order correlator -- which we
show can substantially improve the learnability of strongly-interacting systems
by virtue of displaying informative physics at large times and distances. We
identify two general scenarios in which out-of-time-order correlators provide a
significant advantage for learning tasks in locally-interacting systems: (i)
when experimental access to the system is spatially-restricted, for example via
a single "probe" degree of freedom, and (ii) when one desires to characterize
weak interactions whose strength is much less than the typical interaction
strength. We numerically characterize these advantages across a variety of
learning problems, and find that they are robust to both read-out error and
decoherence. Finally, we introduce a binary classification task that can be
accomplished in constant time with out-of-time-order measurements. In a
companion paper, we prove that this task is exponentially hard with any
adaptive learning protocol that only involves time-ordered operations.

Geometrical designs of interacting nanomagnets have been studied extensively
in the form of two dimensional arrays called artificial spin ice. These systems
are usually designed to create geometrical frustration and are of interest for
the unusual and often surprising phenomena that can emerge. Advanced
lithographic and element growth techniques have enabled the realization of
complex designs that can involve elements arranged in three dimensions. Using
numerical simulations employing the dumbbell approximation, we examine possible
magnetic behaviours for bilayer artificial spin ice (BASI) in which the
individual layers are rotated with respect to one another. The goal is to
understand how magnetization dynamics are affected by long-range dipolar
coupling that can be modified by varying the layer separation and layer
alignment through rotation. We consider bilayers where the layers are both
either square or pinwheel arrangements of islands. Magnetic reversal processes
are studied and discussed in terms of domain and domain wall configurations of
the magnetic islands. Unusual magnetic ordering is predicted for special angles
which define lateral spin superlattices for the bilayer systems.

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model a variety of
dynamical systems in science and engineering. Recent advances in deep learning
have enabled us to solve them in a higher dimension by addressing the curse of
dimensionality in new ways. However, deep learning methods are constrained by
training time and memory. To tackle these shortcomings, we implement Tensor
Neural Networks (TNN), a quantum-inspired neural network architecture that
leverages Tensor Network ideas to improve upon deep learning approaches. We
demonstrate that TNN provide significant parameter savings while attaining the
same accuracy as compared to the classical Dense Neural Network (DNN). In
addition, we also show how TNN can be trained faster than DNN for the same
accuracy. We benchmark TNN by applying them to solve parabolic PDEs,
specifically the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, widely used in financial
pricing theory, empirically showing the advantages of TNN over DNN. Further
examples, such as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, are also discussed.

We investigate spin-dependent transmission in a curved graphene superlattice
of $N$ cells where each one is made up of four regions. The first is concave,
and the third is convex, two arcs of circles separated by a distance $d$ from
flat graphene sheets. The tunneling analysis allows us to determine all
transmission and reflection channels associated with our system. As a result,
we show that the number of cells acts by decreasing the transmissions with the
same spin. We predict a solid spin-filtering effect when $d$ and $N$ are
sufficiently large. Finally, it is determined that the degree and duration of
suppression of the transmissions with the same spin over a range of energy are
controllable using $d$.

We formulate a semi-classical circuit model to clarify the role of quantum
entanglement in the recently discovered encoding phase transitions in quantum
circuits with measurements. As a starting point we define a random circuit
model with nearest neighbor classical gates interrupted by erasure errors. In
analogy with the quantum setting, this system undergoes a purification
transition at a critical error rate above which the classical information
entropy in the output state vanishes. We show that this phase transition is in
the directed percolation universality class, consistent with the fact that
having zero entropy is an absorbing state of the dynamics; this classical
circuit cannot generate entropy. Adding an arbitrarily small density of quantum
gates in the presence of errors eliminates the transition by destroying the
absorbing state: the quantum gates generate internal entanglement, which can be
effectively converted to classical entropy by the errors. We describe the
universal properties of this instability in an effective model of the
semi-classical circuit. Our model highlights the crucial differences between
information dynamics in classical and quantum circuits.

Electrons at the border of localization generate exotic states of matter
across all classes of strongly correlated electron materials and many other
quantum materials with emergent functionality. Heavy electron metals are a
model example, in which magnetic interactions arise from the opposing limits of
localized and itinerant electrons. This remarkable duality is intimately
related to the emergence of a plethora of novel quantum matter states such as
unconventional superconductivity, electronic-nematic states, hidden order and
most recently topological states of matter such as topological Kondo insulators
and Kondo semimetals and putative chiral superconductors. The outstanding
challenge is that the archetypal Kondo lattice model that captures the
underlying electronic dichotomy is notoriously difficult to solve for real
materials. Here we show, using the prototypical strongly-correlated
antiferromagnet CeIn$_3$, that a multi-orbital periodic Anderson model embedded
with input from ab initio bandstructure calculations can be reduced to a simple
Kondo-Heisenberg model, which captures the magnetic interactions
quantitatively. We validate this tractable Hamiltonian via high-resolution
neutron spectroscopy that reproduces accurately the magnetic soft modes in
CeIn$_3$, which are believed to mediate unconventional superconductivity. Our
study paves the way for a quantitative understanding of metallic quantum states
such as unconventional superconductivity.

The physics of the glass transition and amorphous materials continues to

Supercooled liquids and glasses have been studied numerically since the advent

Our goal in this review is to provide a modern perspective on this area. We

observables. We first summarise recent algorithmic developments to achieve
enhanced sampling and faster equilibration using replica exchange methods,
cluster and swap Monte Carlo algorithms, and other techniques. We then review
some major recent advances afforded by these novel tools regarding the

Although chromium trihalides are widely regarded as a promising class of
two-dimensional magnets for next-generation devices, an accurate description of
their electronic structure and magnetic interactions has proven challenging to
achieve. Here, we quantify electronic excitations and spin interactions in
Cr$X_3$ ($X=$~Cl, Br, I) using embedded many-body wavefunction calculations and
fully generalized spin Hamiltonians. We find that the three trihalides feature
comparable $d$-shell excitations, consisting of a high-spin $^4A_2$
$(t^3_{2g}e^0_{g})$ ground state lying 1.5$-$1.7 eV below the first excited
state $^4T_2$ ($t^2_{2g}e^1_{g}$). CrCl$_3$ exhibits a single-ion anisotropy
$A_{\rm sia} = -0.02$ meV, while the Cr spin-3/2 moments are ferromagnetically
coupled through bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions of $J_1 = -0.97$
meV and $J_2 = -0.05$ meV, respectively. The corresponding values for CrBr$_3$
and CrI$_3$ increase to $A_{\rm sia} = -0.08$ meV and $A_{\rm sia} = -0.12$ meV
for the single-ion anisotropy, $J_1 = -1.21$ meV, $J_2 = -0.05$ meV and $J_1 =
-1.38$ meV, $J_2 = -0.06$ meV for the exchange couplings, respectively. We find
that the overall magnetic anisotropy is defined by the interplay between
$A_{\rm sia}$ and $A_{\rm dip}$ due to magnetic dipole-dipole interaction that
favors in-plane orientation of magnetic moments in ferromagnetic monolayers and
bulk layered magnets. The competition between the two contributions sets
CrCl$_3$ and CrI$_3$ as the easy-plane ($A_{\rm sia}+ A_{\rm dip} > 0$) and
easy-axis ($A_{\rm sia}+ A_{\rm dip} < 0$) ferromagnets, respectively. The
differences between the magnets trace back to the atomic radii of the halogen
ligands and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. Our findings are in excellent
agreement with recent experiments, thus providing reference values for the
fundamental interactions in chromium trihalides.

A scalable spin-based quantum processor requires a suitable semiconductor
heterostructure and a gate design, with multiple alternatives being
investigated. Characterizing such devices experimentally is a demanding task,
with the full development cycle taking at least months. While numerical
simulations are more time-efficient, their predictive power is limited due to
unavoidable disorder and device-to-device variation. We develop a spin-qubit
device simulation for determining the distribution of the coupling strengths
between the electrostatic gate potentials and the effective device Hamiltonian
in presence of disorder. By comparing our simulation results with the
experimental data, we demonstrate that the coupling of the gate voltages to the
dot chemical potential and the interdot tunnel coupling match up to
disorder-induced variance. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we
also analyze an alternative non-planar geometry inspired by FinFET devices.

Employing the elemental sensitivity of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), we study the valence and magnetic
order in the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We probe spin population
of the f-electrons in Ce and d-electrons in Co as a function of temperature
(down to 0.1 K) and magnetic field (up to 6 T). From the XAS we find a
pronounced contribution of Ce$^{4+}$ component at low temperature and a clear
temperature dependence of the Ce valence below 5 K, suggesting enhanced valence
fluctuations, an indication for the presence of a nearby quantum critical point
(QCP). We observe no significant corresponding change with magnetic field. The
XMCD displays a weak signal for Ce becoming clear only at 6 T. This splitting
of the Kramers doublet ground state of Ce$^{3+}$ is significantly smaller than
expected for independent but screened ions, indicating strong antiferromagnetic
pair interactions. The unconventional character of superconductivity in
CeCoIn$_5$ is evident in the extremely large specific heat step at the
superconducting transition.

Due to its proximity to room temperature and demonstrated high degree of
temperature tunability, the metamagnetic ordering transition in FeRh is
attractive for novel high-performance computing devices seeking to use
magnetism as the state variable. We demonstrate electrical control of the
transition via Joule heating in FeRh wires. Finite element simulations based on
abrupt state transition within each domain result in a globally smooth
transition that agrees with the experimental findings and provides insight into
the thermodynamics involved. We measure a 150 K decrease in transition
temperature with currents up to 60 mA, limited only by the dimensions of the
device. The sizeable shift in transition temperature scales with current
density and wire length, suggesting the absolute resistance and heat
dissipation of the substrate are also important. The FeRh phase change is
evaluated by pulsed I-V using a variety of bias conditions. We demonstrate high
speed (~ ns) memristor-like behavior and report device performance parameters
such as switching speed and power consumption that compare favorably with
state-of-the-art phase change memristive technologies.

We study the current large deviations for a lattice model of interacting
active particles displaying a motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To do
this, we first derive the exact fluctuating hydrodynamics of the model in the
large system limit. On top of the usual Gaussian noise terms the theory also
presents Poissonian noise terms, that we fully account for. We find a dynamical
phase transition between flat density profiles and sharply phase-separated
traveling waves, and we derive the associated phase diagram together with the
large deviation function for all phases, including the one displaying MIPS. We
show how the results can be obtained using methods similar to those of
equilibrium phase separation, in spite of the nonequilibrium nature of the
problem.

A mutual interplay between the charge and spin degrees of freedom in
itinerant magnets leads to a plethora of topological spin textures, such as
magnetic skyrmion and vortex crystals, in both centrosymmetric and
noncentrosymmetric hosts. Meanwhile, their stabilization has been extensively
studied in the system including the classical localized spins. We here study a
realization of the skyrmion crystal in the centrosymmetric triangular-lattice
Hubbard model, where the itinerant nature of electrons plays a more significant
role. By performing the self-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that
two types of skyrmion crystals with spatially nonuniform charge modulations
appear in the ground state at a zero magnetic field. Moreover, we obtain
another noncoplanar vortex crystal phase without a net scalar chirality in the
vicinity of the skyrmion crystal phase. We show that the latter vortex crystal
exhibits the topological phase transition to a different skyrmion phase in an
applied magnetic field. Our results provide a possibility of the skyrmion and
vortex crystals in itinerant magnets without the localized moments.

A strong superconducting diode effect (SDE) is revealed in a thin
superconducting film periodically nanostructured with magnetic dots. The SDE is
caused by the current-activated dissipation mitigated by vortex-antivortex
pairs (VAPs), which periodically nucleate under the dots, move and annihilate
in the superconductor - eventually driving the system to the high-resistive
state. Inversing the polarity of the applied current destimulates the
nucleation of VAPs, the system remains superconducting up to far larger
currents, leading to the pronounced diodic response. Our dissipative
Ginzburg-Landau simulations detail the involved processes, and provide reliable
geometric and parametric ranges for the experimental realization of such a
non-volatile superconducting diode, which operates in absence of any applied
magnetic field while being fluxonic by design.
