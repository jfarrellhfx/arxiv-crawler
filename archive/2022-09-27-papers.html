<h3>Brownian motion of flexibly-linked colloidal rings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13427" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13427</a>
<br>

Ring, or cyclic, polymers have unique properties compared to linear polymers,
due to their topologically closed structure that has no beginning or end.
Experimental measurements on molecular ring polymers are challenging due to
their polydispersity in molecular weight and the presence of undesired side
products such as chains. Here, we study an experimental model system for cyclic
polymers, that consists of rings of flexibly-linked micron-sized colloids with
$n$=4..8 segments. We characterize the conformations of these flexible
colloidal rings and find that they are freely-jointed up to steric
restrictions. We measure their diffusive behavior and compare it to
hydrodynamic simulations. Interestingly, flexible colloidal rings have a larger
translational and rotational diffusion coefficient compared to colloidal
chains. In contrast to chains, their internal deformation mode shows slower
fluctuations for $n\lesssim 8$ and saturates for higher values of $n$. We show
that constraints stemming from the ring structure cause this decrease in
flexibility for small $n$ and infer the expected scaling of the flexibility as
function of ring size. Our findings could have implications for the behavior of
both synthetic and biological ring polymers, as well as for the dynamic modes
of floppy colloidal materials.

<h3>Real-space Obstruction in Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12915</a>
<br>
<i>Philipp Eck, Carmine Ortix, Armando Consiglio, Jonas Erhardt, Maximilian Bauernfeind, Simon Moser, Ralph Claessen, Domenico Di Sante, Giorgio Sangiovanni</i>
<br>
The recently introduced classification of two-dimensional insulators in terms
of topological crystalline invariants has been applied so far to "obstructed"
atomic insulators characterized by a mismatch between the centers of the
electronic Wannier functions and the ionic positions. We extend this notion to
quantum spin Hall insulators in which the ground state cannot be described in
terms of time-reversal symmetric localized Wannier functions. A system
equivalent to graphene in all its relevant electronic and topological
properties except for a real-space obstruction is identified and studied via
symmetry analysis as well as with density functional theory. The low-energy
model comprises a local spin-orbit coupling and a non-local symmetry breaking
potential, which turn out to be the essential ingredients for an obstructed
quantum spin Hall insulator. An experimental fingerprint of the obstruction is
then measured in a large-gap triangular quantum spin Hall material.

<h3>Detecting Subsystem Symmetry Protected Topological Order Through Strange  Correlators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12917</a>
<br>
<i>Chengkang Zhou, Meng-Yuan Li, Zheng Yan, Peng Ye, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<br>
We employ strange correlators to detect 2D subsystem symmetry protected
topological (SSPT) phases which are nontrivial topological phases protected by
subsystem symmetries. Specifically, we analytically construct efficient strange
correlators in the 2D cluster model in the presence of uniform magnetic field,
and then perform the projector Quantum Monte Carlo simulation within the
quantum annealing scheme. We find that strange correlators show long range
correlation in the SSPT phase, from which we define strange order parameters to
characterize the topological phase transition between the SSPT phase at low
fields and the trivial paramagnetic phase at high fields. Thus, the detection
of the fully localized zero modes on the 1D physical boundary of SSPT phase has
been transformed to the bulk local measurement with the periodic boundary
condition. We also find interesting spatial anisotropy of a strange correlator,
which can be intrinsically traced back to the nature of spatial anisotropy of
subsystem symmetries that protect SSPT order in the 2D cluster model. By
simulating strange correlators, we therefore provide the first unbiased
large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation on the easy and efficient detection
in the SSPT phase and open the avenue of the investigation of the subtle yet
fundamental nature of the novel interacting topological phases.

<h3>A dynamical model for Brownian molecular motors driven by inelastic  electron tunneling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12922</a>
<br>
<i>Federico D. Ribetto, Sebastián E. Deghi, Hernán L. Calvo, Raúl A. Bustos-Marún</i>
<br>
In recent years, several artificial molecular motors driven and controlled by
electric currents have been proposed. Similar to Brownian machines, these
systems work by turning random inelastic tunneling events into a directional
rotation of the molecule. Despite their importance as the ultimate component of
future molecular machines, their modeling has not been sufficiently studied.
Here, we develop a dynamical model to describe these systems. We illustrate the
validity and usefulness of our model by applying it to a well-known molecular
motor, showing that the obtained results are consistent with the available
experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate how to use our model to extract
some difficult-to-access microscopic parameters. Finally, we include an
analysis of the expected effects of current-induced forces (CIFs). Our analysis
suggests that, although nonconservative contributions of the CIFs can be
important in some scenarios, they do not seem important in the analyzed case.
Despite this, the conservative contributions of CIFs could be strong enough to
significantly alter the system's dynamics.

<h3>Symmetric Wannier states and tight-binding model for quantum spin Hall  bands in AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12928</a>
<br>
<i>Xun-Jiang Luo, Minxuan Wang, Fengcheng Wu</i>
<br>
Motivated by the observation of topological states in AB-stacked
MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, we construct the symmetry-adapted Wannier states and
tight-binding model for the quantum spin Hall bands in this system. Our
construction is based on the symmetry analysis of Bloch states obtained from
the continuum moir\'e Hamiltonian. For model parameters extracted from
first-principles calculations, we find that the quantum spin Hall bands can be
described by a tight-binding model defined on a triangular lattice. There are
two Wannier states per valley, which have the same Wannier center but different
angular momenta under threefold rotation. The tight-binding model not only
reproduces the energy spectrum, but also accurately describes the topological
phase transition induced by the out-of-plane displacement field. Our study
sheds new light on the topological states in moir\'e transition metal
dichalcogenides bilayers, and provides a route to addressing the many-body
physics in AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$.

<h3>Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of Majorana zero modes in a Kitaev spin  liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12930" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12930</a>
<br>
<i>Tim Bauer, Lucas R. D. Freitas, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Reinhold Egger</i>
<br>
We describe scanning tunneling spectroscopic signatures of Majorana zero
modes (MZMs) in Kitaev spin liquids. The tunnel conductance is determined by
the dynamical spin correlations of the spin liquid, which we compute exactly,
and by spin-anisotropic cotunneling form factors. Near a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex,
the tunnel conductance has a staircase voltage dependence, where conductance
steps arise from MZMs and (at higher voltages) from additional vortex
configurations. By scanning the probe tip position, one can detect the vortex
locations. Our analysis suggests that topological magnon bound states near
defects or magnetic impurities are unlikely to fake the predicted MZM
signatures.

<h3>Criticality in the crossed Andreev reflection of a quantum Hall edge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12932" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12932</a>
<br>
<i>Vladislav D. Kurilovich, Leonid I. Glazman</i>
<br>
We develop a theory of the non-local transport of two counter-propagating
$\nu = 1$ quantum Hall edges coupled via a narrow disordered superconductor.
The system is self-tuned to the critical point between trivial and topological
phases by the competition between tunneling processes with or without
particle-hole conversion. The critical conductance is a random, sample-specific
quantity with a zero average and unusual bias dependence. The negative values
of conductance are relatively stable against variations of the carrier density,
which may make the critical state to appear as a topological one.

<h3>Emergent conservation in Floquet dynamics of integrable non-Hermitian  models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12939</a>
<br>
<i>Tista Banerjee, K. Sengupta</i>
<br>
We study the dynamics of a class of integrable non-Hermitian free-fermionic
models driven periodically using a continuous drive protocol characterized by
an amplitude $g_1$ and frequency $\omega_D$. We derive an analytic, albeit
perturbative, Floquet Hamiltonian for describing such systems using Floquet
perturbation theory with $g_1^{-1}$ being the perturbation parameter. Our
analysis indicates the existence of special drive frequencies at which an
approximately conserved quantity emerges. The presence of such an almost
conserved quantity is reflected in the dynamics of the fidelity, the
correlation functions and the half-chain entanglement entropy of the driven
system. In addition, it also controls the nature of the steady state of the
system. We show that one-dimensional (1D) transverse field Ising model, with an
imaginary component of the transverse field, serves as an experimentally
relevant example of this phenomenon. In this case, the transverse magnetization
is approximately conserved; this conservation leads to complete suppression of
oscillatory features in the transient dynamics of fidelity, magnetization, and
entanglement of the driven chain at special drive frequencies. We discuss the
nature of the steady state of the Ising chain near and away from these special
frequencies, demonstrate the protocol independence of this phenomenon by
showing its existence for discrete drive protocols, and suggest experiments
which can test our theory.

<h3>Sufficient condition for gapless spin-boson Lindbladians, and its  connection to dissipative time-crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12949" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12949</a>
<br>
<i>Leonardo da Silva Souza, Luis Fernando dos Prazeres, Fernando Iemini</i>
<br>
We discuss a sufficient condition for gapless excitations in the Lindbladian
master equation for collective spin-boson systems and permutationally invariant
systems. The condition relates the extensivity of the cumulant correlations in
the macroscopic steady state to the presence of gapless modes in the
Lindbladian. In phases arising from competing coherent and dissipative
Lindbladian terms, we argue that such gapless modes can lead to persistent
dynamics in the spin observables with the possible formation of dissipative
time-crystals. We study different models within this perspective, from
Lindbladians with Hermitian jump operators, to nonHermitian ones composed by
collective spins and Floquet spin-boson systems. We also provide a simple
analytical proof for the exactness of mean-field semiclassical approach in such
systems based on a cumulant expansion.

<h3>Diodic transport response and the loop current state in twisted trilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12964</a>
<br>
<i>Naiyuan J. Zhang, Jiang-Xiazi Lin, Yibang Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Liang Fu, J.I.A. Li</i>
<br>
The discovery of magic-angle graphene moir\'e systems has unlocked a wide
variety of intriguing emergent phenomena, such as superconductivity and orbital
ferromagnetism. In this work, we report the discovery of a new type of
electronic order in twisted trilayer graphene that breaks both parity and
time-reversal symmetry. This is identified based on highly nonreciprocal,
diode-like current-voltage characteristics throughout the moir\'e flatband,
which exhibits a one-fold or three-fold symmetric angular dependence as a
function of the azimuth direction of current flow. By analyzing the
relationship between the nonreciprocal response and the orbital ferromagnetism,
we show that this parity-breaking order can be described as a valley-polarized
loop current state, which is highly tunable with magnetic field, current flow,
and field-effect doping. Our findings point towards the universal presence of
valley-polarized isospin order and rotational symmetry breaking across the
moir\'e flatband, with important implications for understanding intertwined and
competing orders, such as ferromagnetism, nematicity, and superconductivity, in
graphene-based moir\'e systems.

<h3>Critical Fluctuations in Polymer Solutions: Crossover from Criticality  to Tricriticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12965" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12965</a>
<br>
<i>Mikhail A. Anisimov, Thomas J. Longo, Jan V. Sengers</i>
<br>
Critical fluctuations in fluids and fluid mixtures yield a nonanalytic
asymptotic Ising-like critical thermodynamic behavior in terms of power laws
with universal exponents. In polymer solutions, the amplitudes of these power
laws depend on the degree of polymerization. Nonasymptotic behavior (upon the
departure from the critical point) is particularly interesting in the case of
polymer solutions, where it is governed by a competition between the
correlation length of the critical fluctuations and the radius of gyration of
the polymer molecules. If the correlation length is the dominant length scale,
Ising-like critical behavior is observed. If, however, the radius of gyration
exceeds the correlation length, tricritical behavior with mean-field critical
exponents is observed. The Ising-like critical region shrinks with the increase
of the polymer molecular weight. In the limit of an infinite degree of
polymerization, the Ising-like critical region vanishes, yielding to
theta-point tricriticality.

<h3>Electron energy loss spectroscopy database synthesis and automation of  core-loss edge recognition by deep-learning neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13026</a>
<br>
<i>Lingli Kong, Zhengran Ji, Huolin L. Xin</i>
<br>
The ionization edges encoded in the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
spectra enable advanced material analysis including composition analyses and
elemental quantifications. The development of the parallel EELS instrument and
fast, sensitive detectors have greatly improved the acquisition speed of EELS
spectra. However, the traditional way of core-loss edge recognition is
experience based and human labor dependent, which limits the processing speed.
So far, the low signal-noise ratio and the low jump ratio of the core-loss
edges on the raw EELS spectra have been challenging for the automation of edge
recognition. In this work, a convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory
neural network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed to automate the detection and elemental
identification of core-loss edges from raw spectra. An EELS spectral database
is synthesized by using our forward model to assist in the training and
validation of the neural network. To make the synthesized spectra resemble the
real spectra, we collected a large library of experimentally acquired EELS core
edges. In synthesize the training library, the edges are modeled by fitting the
multi-gaussian model to the real edges from experiments, and the noise and
instrumental imperfectness are simulated and added. The well-trained CNN-BiLSTM
network is tested against both the simulated spectra and real spectra collected
from experiments. The high accuracy of the network, 94.9 %, proves that,
without complicated preprocessing of the raw spectra, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM
network achieves the automation of core-loss edge recognition for EELS spectra
with high accuracy.

<h3>An $ab~initio$ study of the electron-hole pairs in a correlated van der  Waals antiferromagnet: NiPS$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13051</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher Lane, Jian-Xin Zhu</i>
<br>
The recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnet NiPS$_3$
provides a new route to examine many-body quasiparticles under 2D confinement.
Excitons are of particular interest due to their strong coupling to the
magnetic ground state. Here, by using a first-principles-based approach, we
find bright excitons between 1.4 eV to 1.7 eV similar to the coherent exciton
experimentally observed. Our analysis shows that each exciton in NiPS$_3$ is
composed of a combination of $d$-$d$ and charge-transfer character, where the
relative ratio of each pairing configuration changes with exciton energy.
Finally, the wave function of the electrons and holes is revealed to be spatial
indirect, spanning the zig-zag AFM domain wall, suggesting a microscopic origin
of the observed strong magneto-exciton coupling.

<h3>Stacking dependent ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in  quasi-one-dimensional oxyhalides NbO$X_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13070" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13070</a>
<br>
<i>Wencong Sun, Ning Ding, Jun Chen, Hai-Peng You, Jin Peng, Shan-Shan Wang, Shuai Dong</i>
<br>
Low-dimensional ferroelectricity and polar materials have attracted
considerable attentions for their fascinating physics and potential
applications. Based on first-principles calculations, here we investigate the
stacking modes and polar properties of a typical series of
quasi-one-dimensional ferroelectrics: double-chain oxyhalides NbO$X_3$ ($X$=Cl,
Br, I). The geometry of their double-chains allows both the
interchain/intrachain permutation. Thus, different stacking modes of
double-chains lead to a variety of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases
in both the tetragonal and monoclinic crystals. The proximate energies of these
phases may lead to multiphase coexistence in real materials, as well as the
hydrostatic pressure driving structural phase transition. Their spontaneous
polarizations and piezoelectricity of the ferroelectric phases are prominent,
comparable to commercially used ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and piezoelectric ZnO,
respectively. Our work demonstrates that the van der Waals NbO$X_3$ are
promising materials for exploring quasi-one-dimensional ferroelectricity and
antiferroelectricity.

<h3>Flux-periodic oscillations in proximitized core-shell nanowires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13076</a>
<br>
<i>Kristjan Ottar Klausen, Anna Sitek, Sigurdur I. Erlingsson, Andrei Manolescu</i>
<br>
Flux-periodic oscillations of the superconducting gap in proximitized
core-shell nanowires are explored. Periodicity of oscillations in the energy
spectrum of a cylindrical nanowire is compared with nanowires having hexagonal
and square cross-section geometry, along with the effects of Zeeman and Rashba
spin-orbit interaction. A transition between h/e and h/2e periodicity is found
and shown to be dependent on the chemical potential, with correspondence to
degeneracy points of the angular momentum quantum number. For a thin shell of a
square nanowire, solely h/e periodicity is found in the infinite wire spectrum
and shown to result from energy separation between the lowest groups of excited
states.

<h3>Large-Scale Numerical-Diagonalization Study of the Shastry-Sutherland  Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13105" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13105</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroki Nakano, Toru Sakai</i>
<br>
The $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the orthogonal-dimer lattice
(Shastry-Sutherland model) is studied by the Lanczos diagonalization method.
The properties of this model are determined by the ratio of two interactions,
namely, $r=J_2/J_1$, where $J_1$ denotes the amplitude of spin interactions at
orthogonal dimers and the interactions represented by $J_2$ form the square
lattice. We focus our attention on the edge of the phase in which the dimer
state is realized as the exact ground state. Our large-scale calculations of
diagonalizations treating finite-size clusters including 44 and 48 spin sites
successfully detect the target edge. Our conclusion is that the ratio for the
edge is $r= 0.6754(2)$. This estimate is compared with an experimental result
from electron spin resonance measurements.

<h3>Chemical Partitioning at Crystalline Defects in PtAu as a Pathway to  Stabilize Electrocatalysts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13166</a>
<br>
<i>Xuyang Zhou, Olga Kasian, Ting Luo, Se-Ho Kim, Chenyu Zhang, Siyuan Zhang, Subin Lee, Gregory B. Thompson, Gerhard Dehm, Baptiste Gault, Dierk Raabe</i>
<br>
Dissolution of electrocatalysts during long-term and dynamic operation is a
challenging problem in energy conversion and storage devices such as fuel cells
and electrolyzers. To develop stable electrocatalysts, we adopt the design
concept of segregation engineering, which uses solute segregation prone to
electrochemical dissolution at internal defects, i.e., grain boundaries and
dislocations. We showcase the feasibility of this approach by stabilizing a
model Pt catalyst with an addition of more noble Au (approximately 5 atomic
percent). We characterized the defects' nanoscale structure and chemistry, and
monitored the electrochemical dissolution of Pt and PtAu alloys by online
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Once segregated to defects, Au
atoms can stabilize and hence passivate the most vulnerable sites against
electrochemical dissolution and improve the stability and longevity of the Pt
electrocatalysts by more than an order of magnitude. This opens pathways to use
solute segregation to defects for the development of more stable nanoscale
electrocatalysts, a concept applicable for a wide range of catalytic systems.

1D spin-wave conduits are envisioned as nanoscale components of
magnonics-based logic and computing schemes for future generation electronics.
`A-la-carte methods of versatile control of the local magnetization dynamics in
such nanochannels are highly desired for efficient steering of the spin waves
in magnonic devices. Here, we present a study of localized dynamical modes in
1-$\mu$m-wide Permalloy conduits probed by microresonator ferromagnetic
resonance technique. We clearly observe the lowest-energy edge mode in the
microstrip after its edges were finely trimmed by means of focused Ne$^+$ ion
irradiation. Furthermore, after milling the microstrip along its long axis by
focused ion beams, creating consecutively $\sim$50 and $\sim$100 nm gaps,
additional resonances emerge and are attributed to modes localized at the inner
edges of the separated strips. To visualize the mode distribution, spatially
resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy was used showing an excellent
agreement with the ferromagnetic resonance data and confirming the mode
localization at the outer/inner edges of the strips depending on the magnitude
of the applied magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that the
lowest-energy modes are localized within $\sim$15-nm-wide regions at the edges
of the strips and their frequencies can be tuned in a wide range (up to 5 GHz)
by changing the magnetostatic coupling (i.e. spatial separation) between the
microstrips.

<h3>Relationship between two-particle topology and fractional Chern  insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13215</a>

Lattice generalizations of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, called
fractional Chern insulators (FCIs), have been extensively investigated in
strongly correlated systems. Despite many efforts, previous studies have not
revealed all of the guiding principles for the FCI search. In this paper, we
investigate a relationship between the topological band structure in the
two-particle problem and the FCI ground states in the many-body problem. We
first formulate the two-particle problem of a bosonic on-site interaction
projected onto the lowest band of a given tight-binding Hamiltonian. We
introduce a reduced Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues correspond to the
two-particle bound-state energies. By using the reduced Hamiltonian, we define
the two-particle Chern number and numerically check the bulk-boundary
correspondence that is predicted by the two-particle Chern number. We then
propose that a nontrivial two-particle Chern number of dominant bands roughly
indicates the presence of bosonic FCI ground states at filling factor
$\nu=1/2$. We numerically investigate this relationship in several
tight-binding models with Chern bands and find that it holds well in most of
the cases, albeit two-band models being exceptions. Although the two-particle
topology is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the FCI state as
other indicators in previous studies, our numerical results indicate that the
two-particle topology characterizes the degree of similarity to the FQH
systems.

<h3>Enhancement of Hot Carrier Effects and Signatures of Confinement in  Terms of Thermalization Power in Quantum Well Solar Cells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13218</a>
<br>

<br>
A theoretical model using electron-phonon scattering rate equations is
developed for assessing carrier thermalization under steady-state conditions in
two-dimensional systems. The model is applied to investigate the hot carrier
effect in III-V hot-carrier solar cells with a quantum well absorber. The
question underlying the proposed investigation is: what is the power required
to maintain two populations of electron and hole carriers in a
quasi-equilibrium state at fixed temperatures and quasi-Fermi level splitting?
The obtained answer is that the thermalization power density is reduced in
two-dimensional systems compared to their bulk counterpart, which demonstrates
a confinement-induced enhancement of the hot carrier effect in quantum wells.
This power overall increases with the well thickness, and it is moreover shown
that the intra-subband contribution dominates at small thicknesses while the
inter-subband contribution increases with thickness and dominates in the bulk
limit. Finally, the effects of the thermodynamic state of phonons and screening
are clarified. In particular, the two-dimensional thermalization power density
exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the thickness of the quantum well layer,
when both out-of-equilibrium longitudinal optical phonons and screening effects
are taken into account. Our theoretical and numerical results provide tracks to
interpret intriguing experimental observations in quantum well physics. They
will also offer guidelines to increase the yield of photovoltaic effect based
on the hot carrier effect using quantum well heterostructures, a result
critical to the research toward high-efficiency solar cell devices.

<br>
We report on the experimental observation of the quantum phase transition
from a para- to a ferromagnetic state in a spatially extended atomic condensate
in the presence of a coherent coupling between two internal spin states. The
nature of the transition is experimentally assessed by looking at the phase
diagram as a function of the control parameters, at hysteresis phenomena, and
at the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization fluctuations around the
critical point. Agreement with mean-field calculations is shown. We develop
experimental protocols to deterministically generate domain walls that separate
spatial regions of opposite magnetization in the ferromagnetic state. Thanks to
the enhanced coherence properties of our atomic superfluid system compared to
standard condensed matter systems, our results open the way towards the study
of different aspects of the relaxation dynamics in isolated coherent quantum
systems.

suspensions, with particles of sizes in the micron range, for which thermal
fluctuations cannot be ignored. Using confocal microscopy on a miniaturized
set-up, we observe that, in contrast with standard granular rheology, the flow
profiles strongly depend on the particles size. Also, suspensions composed of
small enough particles flow at infinitesimal inclinations. From the velocity
measurements, an effective rheology is extracted in terms of a friction
coefficient as a fonction of the dimensionless shear rate (the viscous number),
and of the particle pressure normalized by the thermal pressure. Inspired by a
previous work [1], a phenomenological model based on the sum of a thermal
contribution describing the glass transition and an athermal contribution
capturing the jamming transition is developed, which reproduces well the
experimental observations. The model predicts the existence of a glassy
friction angle lower than the granular athermal friction angle, a signature of
the glass transition in the framework of a pressure imposed rheology.

<br>
BaCe$_{0.25}$Mn$_{0.75}$O$_{3-\delta}$ (BCM), a non-stoichiometric oxide
closely resembling a perovskite crystal structure, has recently emerged as a
prospective contender for application in renewable energy harvesting by solar
thermochemical hydrogen generation. Using solar energy, oxygen-vacancies can be
created in BCM and the reduced crystal so obtained can, in turn, produce H2 by
stripping oxygen from H2O. Therefore, a first step toward understanding the
working mechanism and optimizing the performance of BCM, is a thorough and
comparative analysis of the electronic structure of the pristine and the
reduced material. In this paper, we probe the electronic structure of BCM using
the combined effort of first-principles calculations and experimental O K-edge
x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The computed projected density-of-states
(PDOS) and orbital-plots are used to propose a simplified model for
orbital-mixing between the oxygen and the ligand atoms. With the help of
state-of-the-art simulations, we are able to find the origins of the XAS peaks
and to categorize them on the basis of contribution from Ce and Mn. For the
reduced crystal, the calculations show that, as a consequence of dielectric
screening, the change in electron-density resulting from the reduction is
strongly localized around the oxygen vacancy. Our experimental studies reveal a
marked lowering of the first O K-edge peak in the reduced crystal which is
shown to result from a diminished O-2p contribution to the frontier unoccupied
orbitals, in accordance with the tight-binding scheme. Our study paves the way
for investigation of the working-mechanism of BCM and for computational and
experimental efforts aimed at design and discovery of efficient water-splitting
oxides.

<br>
We present detailed studies of the superconductivity in high-pressure H3S.
X-ray diffraction measurements show that cubic Im-3m H3S was synthesized from
elemental sulfur and hydrogen donor ammonia borane (NH3BH3). Our electrical
transport measurements confirm superconductivity with a transition temperature
Tc = 197 K at 153 GPa. From the analysis of both the normal state resistivity
and the slope of the critical field, we conclude that the superconductivity is
described by clean-limit behaviour. A significant broadening of the resistive
transition in finite magnetic field is found, as expected for superconductors.
We identify a linear temperature-over-field scaling of the resistance at the
superconducting transition which is not described by existing theories.

<h3>Evolution of entanglement entropy in strongly correlated bosons in an  optical lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13340</a>
<br>
<i>Shion Yamashika, Daichi Kagamihara, Ryosuke Yoshii, Shunji Tsuchiya</i>
<br>
We study the time evolution of entanglement entropy of bosons in a
one-dimensional optical lattice induced by a sudden quench of the hopping
amplitude $J$. We consider the system being quenched into the deep
Mott-insulating (MI) regime, i.e., $J/U\ll 1$ ($U$ is the strength of the
on-site repulsive interaction), from the product state with individual boson
isolated in each lattice site. The low-energy excited states in this regime can
be effectively described by fermionic quasiparticles known as doublons and
holons. Developing the effective theory, we analytically calculate the time
evolution of the second-order R\'enyi entropy (RE) for a subsystem and propose
a quasiparticle picture for the time evolution of the RE based on the obtained
analytic expressions. Doublons and holons are excited by the quench as
entangled pairs that propagate with the velocity $v_{\rm pair}=6J$. The RE
reflects the population of doublon-holon pairs that span the boundary of the
subsystem. In the short-time scale ($Jt/\hbar=\mathcal{O}(1)$), the RE exhibits
the rapid oscillations with the frequency $U/\hbar$, while in the long-time
scale ($Jt/\hbar\gg 1$) the RE grows linearly in time until the pair spreads
beyond the size of the subsystem and the RE saturates to a constant. We
analytically show that the constant value of the RE after the saturation obeys
the volume-law scaling.

<h3>Order-disorder Peierls instability in the kagome metal  (Cs,Rb)V$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>

<br>
<i>David Subires, A. Korshunov, A. H. Said, L. Sánchez, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, A. Bosak, S. Blanco-Canosa</i>
<br>
The nature of the charge density wave phases in the kagome metal compound
AV$_3$Sb$_5$ has raised many questions and their origin is still under debate.
Here, we combine diffuse scattering (DS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS)
to identify a 3-dimensional (3D) precursor of the charge order with propagation
vector (0.5 0 0.5), which condenses into a 3D-CDW through a first order phase
transition. The quasi-elastic critical scattering indicates that the dominant
contribution to the diffuse precursor is the elastic central peak without
phonon softening. However, the inelastic spectra show a small broadening of the
Einstein-type phonon mode on approaching the phase transition. Our results
point to the situation where the Fermi surface instability at the \textit{L}
point is of order-disorder type with a critical growth of quasi-static domains.
The results go beyond the classical weak-coupling Peierls transition dynamics
and are discussed within models including strong-electron phonon coupling and
non-adiabaticity.

<br>
<i>Peter Olsson</i>
<br>
We do shear-driven simulations of a simple model of non-Brownian particles in
two dimensions. By examining the velocity distribution at different densities
and shear rates we find strong evidence for the existence of two different
processes, respectively dominated by the slower and the faster particles -- the
slow process and the fast process. The leading divergence in the shear
viscosity is governed by the fast process. An examination of height and
position of the low-velocity peak in the distribution demonstrates that it is
the slow process that is responsible for the correction-to-scaling term in the
critical scaling analysis. We further find that the long range velocity
correlations are primarily due to the slow process which implies that the
diverging viscosity and the diverging correlation length are only indirectly
related.

<br>
<i>Bowen Zeng, Tao Yu</i>
<br>
Radiative damping is a strong dissipation source for the quantum emitters
hybridized with propagating photons, electrons, or phonons, which is not easily
avoidable for on-chip magnonic emitters as well that can radiate via the
surface acoustic waves of the substrate. Here we demonstrate in an array of
on-chip nano-magnets coupled in a long range via exchanging the surface
acoustic waves that a point defect in the array, which can be introduced by the
local magnon frequency shift by a local biased magnetic field or the absence of
a magnetic wire, strongly localizes the magnons, in contrast to the well
spreading Bloch-like collective magnon modes in such an array setting. The
radiation of the magnon defect states is exponentially suppressed by the
distance of the defect to the array edges. Moreover, this defect state is
strikingly inertial to the non-Hermitian topology that localizes all the
extended states at one boundary. Such configuration robust magnon defect states
towards radiation-free limit may be suitable for high-fidelity magnon quantum
information storage in the future on-chip magnonic devices.

<h3>Bending of chiral fractal lattice metamaterials</h3>

<br>
<i>Wenjiao Zhang, Robin Neville, Dayi Zhang, Jie Yuan, Fabrizio Scapa, Roderic Lakes</i>
<br>
We describe the out-of-plane bending of chiral fractal lattices metamaterials
by using a combination of theoretical models, full-scale finite elements and
experimental tests representing the flexural behaviour of metamaterial beams
under three-point bending. Good agreement is observed between the three sets of
results. Parametric analyses show a linear log-log relation between bending
modulus and aspect ratios of the unit cells, which are indicative of the
fractal nature of the metamaterial. The ratio between the bending and in-plane
tensile moduli of these chiral fractal metamaterials ranges between ~ 5 and ~
34 and is linearly proportional to the square of the ratio between length and
width of the ribs of the chiral unit cells at different fractal orders. These
properties suggest that the class of chiral fractal lattice metamaterials offer
metacompliance properties between the flexural and in-plane stretching
behaviours, which can be tailored by the adoption of the fractal scales.

Lead-free ba0.85ca0.15zr0.1ti0.9o3 (bczt) ceramic powders were synthesized
using the sol-gel method. to achieve high-energy storage and large
electrocaloric effect in bulk ceramics the ceramics thickness was reduced.
dielectric, ferroelectric, energy storage, and electrocaloric properties were
investigated for bczt ceramic with 400 {\mu}m. here, pure crystalline structure
and homogenous microstructure were identified by xrd analysis and sem
measurements, respectively. the dielectric measurements revealed a maximum
dielectric constant associated with ferroelectric-paraelectric phase
transition. the maximum of {\epsilon} was 7841 around 352 k. furthermore, the
bczt ceramic showed improved energy storage and electrocaloric properties. a
high recoverable energy density wrec of 0.24 j/cm3 and a total energy density
wtotal of 0.27 j/cm3 with an efficiency coefficient of ~ 88% at 423 k under an
electric field of 55 kv/cm was obtained. besides, the maximum value of
{\delta}t = 2.32 k, the electrocaloric responsivity {\zeta} = 0.42 k mm/kv, the
refrigeration capacity rc= 4.59 j/kg and the coefficient of performance cop =
12.38 were achieved around 384 k under 55 kv/cm. the total energy density
wtotal and the temperature change {\delta}t were also calculated by exploiting
the landau-ginzburg-devonshire (lgd) theory. the theoretical results matched
the experimental findings. these results suggest that the synthesized bczt
ceramic with the reduced thickness could be a promising candidate for energy
storage and electrocaloric applications.

<br>
To determine how electronic correlations open a gap in two-dimensional
massless Dirac electrons in the organic compounds $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$
[$\alpha$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$] and $\alpha$-(BEDT-TSeF)$_2$I$_3$
[$\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$], we derive and analyze $ab$ $initio$ low-energy
effective Hamiltonians for these two compounds. We find that the horizontal
strip charge ordering opens a gap in the massless Dirac electrons in
$\alpha$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$, while an insulating phase without explicit symmetry
breaking appears in $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$. We clarify that the combination
of the anisotropic transfer integrals and the electronic correlations induces a
dimensional reduction in the spin correlations, i.e., one-dimensional spin
correlations develop in $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$. We show that the
one-dimensional spin correlations open a gap in the massless Dirac electrons.
Our finding paves the way for opening gaps for massless Dirac electrons using
strong electronic correlations.

<br>
Barium zirconium sulfide (BaZrS3) is an earth-abundant and environmentally
friendly chalcogenide perovskite with promising properties for various energy
conversion applications. Recently, strong focus has been put into exploring
different synthesis pathways for efficient high-quality thin film growth. Among
them, sulfurization of oxide precursors has been suggested as viable solution
for effective synthesis, especially from perspective of circumventing the
difficulty of handling alkali earth metals. In this work, we explore in detail
the mechanism and efficiency of BaZrS3 formation from BaZrO3 oxide precursors
at various sulfurization temperatures. We propose a formation mechanism of
BaZrS3, which is based on a two-step reaction involving an intermediate
amorphization step of the BaZrO3 crystal phase. We show that the diffusion of S
and the energetic barrier associated to BaZrS3 crystallization are both
rate-limiting steps of this reaction at lower sulfurization temperatures (< 800
{\deg}C). At higher sulfurization temperatures >=800 {\deg}C, a larger rate of
conversion from oxide to sulfide phase is observed. However, even with the
increased conversion rate, only films sulfurized at 1000 {\deg}C have
significantly large grains that make them suitable for optoelectronic devices.
Finally, we observe formation of stoichiometric BaZrS3 ([Ba]/[Zr] = 1) even
under non-equilibrium conditions, such as Zr-rich oxide precursor, with the
extra Zr forming ZrO2 phase at the substrate-film interface. This marks BaZrS3
quite unique among the other types of chalcogenides, such as chalcopyrites and
kesterites, which can accommodate quite a large range of non-stoichiometric
compositions.

<h3>A reduction scheme for coupled Brownian harmonic oscillators</h3>

<br>
<i>Matteo Colangeli, Manh Hong Duong, Adrian Muntean</i>
<br>
We propose a reduction scheme for a system constituted by two coupled
harmonically-bound Brownian oscillators. We reduce the description by
constructing a lower dimensional model which inherits some of the basic
features of the original dynamics and is written in terms of suitable transport
coefficients. The proposed procedure is twofold: while the deterministic
component of the dynamics is obtained by a direct application of the invariant
manifold method, the diffusion terms are determined via the
Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. We highlight the behavior of the coefficients
up to a critical value of the coupling parameter, which marks the endpoint of
the interval in which a contracted description is available. The study of the
weak coupling regime is addressed and the commutativity of alternative
reduction paths is also discussed.

<h3>Taming pseudo-fermion functional renormalization for quantum spins:  Finite-temperatures and the Popov-Fedotov trick</h3>

<br>
<i>Benedikt Schneider, Dominik Kiese, Björn Sbierski</i>
<br>
The pseudo-fermion representation for $S=1/2$ quantum spins introduces
unphysical states in the Hilbert space which can be projected out using the
Popov-Fedotov trick. However, state-of-the-art implementation of the functional
renormalization group method for pseudo-fermions have so far omitted the
Popov-Fedotov projection. Instead, restrictions to zero temperature were made
and absence of unphysical contributions to the ground-state was assumed. We
show by numerous counterexamples that this assumption is not generally true. We
introduce Popov-Fedotov projection to pseudo-fermion functional
renormalization, enabling finite temperature computations with only minor
technical modifications to the method. At large and intermediate temperatures,
our results are perturbatively controlled and we confirm their accuracy in
benchmark calculations. At lower temperatures, the accuracy degrades due to
truncation errors in the hierarchy of flow equations. Interestingly, these
problems cannot be alleviated by switching to the parquet approximation. We
introduce the spin projection as a method-intrinsic quality check. We also show
that finite temperature magnetic ordering transitions can be studied via
finite-size scaling.

Strong driving of quantum systems opens opportunities for both controlling
and characterizing their states. For theoretical studying of these systems
properties we use the rate-equation formalism. The advantage of such approach
is its relative simplicity. We used the formalism for description of a
two-level system (TLS) with further expanding it on a case of a multi-level
system. Obtained theoretical results have good agreement with experiments. The
presented approach can also be considered as one more way to explore properties
of quantum systems and underlying physical processes such as for instance
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana transitions and interference.

<h3>Single crystal growth of iridates without platinum impurities</h3>

<i>Jimin Kim, Hoon Kim, Hyun-Woo J. Kim, Sunwook Park, Jin-Kwang Kim, Junyoung Kwon, Jungho Kim, Hyeong Woo Seo, Jun Sung Kim, B. J. Kim</i>
<br>
Iridates have attracted much interest in the last decade for their novel
magnetism emerging in the limit of strong spin-orbit coupling and possible
unconventional superconductivity. A standard for growing iridate single
crystals has been the flux method using platinum crucibles. Here, we show that
this widely used method compromises the sample quality by inclusion of platinum
impurities. We find that Sr2IrO4 single crystals grown in iridium crucibles
show remarkable differences from those grown in platinum crucibles in their
sample characterizations using Raman spectroscopy, resistivity, magnetization,
optical third harmonic generation, resonant X-ray diffraction, and resonant
inelastic X-ray scattering measurements. In particular, we show that several
peaks of sizable intensities disappear in the Raman spectra of samples free of
platinum impurities, and a significantly larger activation energy is extracted
from the resistivity data compared to previously reported values. Furthermore,
we find no evidence of the previously reported glide symmetry breaking
structural distortions and confirm the I41/acd space group of the lattice
symmetry. Although the platinum impurities are not apparent in the magnetic
properties and thus went unnoticed in the stoichiometric insulating phase for a
long time, their effects can be much more detrimental to transport properties
in chemically doped compounds. Therefore, our result suggests using growth
methods that avoid platinum impurities for an investigation of intrinsic
physical properties of iridates, and possible superconducting phases.

Three-dimensional (3D) excitonic complexes influence the optoelectronic
properties of bulk semiconductors. More generally, correlated few-particle
molecules and ions, held together by pairwise Coulomb potentials, play a
fundamental role in a variety of fields in physics and chemistry. Based on

excitonic three- and four-body complexes (trions and biexcitons) in bulk 3D
semiconductors as well as a range of small molecules and ions in which the
nuclei are treated as quantum particles on an equal footing with the electrons.
We present interpolation formulas that predict the binding energies of these
complexes either in bulk semiconductors or in free space. By evaluating pair
distribution functions within quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the
importance of harmonic and anharmonic vibrational effects in small molecules.

Artificial intelligence-based methods are becoming increasingly effective at
screening libraries of polymers down to a selection that is manageable for
experimental inquiry. The vast majority of presently adopted approaches for
polymer screening rely on handcrafted chemostructural features extracted from
polymer repeat units- a burdensome task as polymer libraries, which approximate
the polymer chemical search space, progressively grow over time. Here, we
demonstrate that directly "machine-learning" important features from a polymer
repeat unit is a cheap and viable alternative to extracting expensive features
by hand. Our approach- based on graph neural networks, multitask learning, and
other advanced deep learning techniques- speeds up feature extraction by one to
two orders of magnitude relative to presently adopted handcrafted methods
without compromising model accuracy for a variety of polymer property
prediction tasks. We anticipate that our approach, which unlocks the screening
of truly massive polymer libraries at scale, will enable more sophisticated and
large scale screening technologies in the field of polymer informatics.

<br>
Quantum liquid, in the form of self-bound droplet, is stabilized by a subtle
balance between the mean-field contribution and quantum fluctuations. While a
liquid-gas transition is expected when such a balance is broken, it remains
elusive whether liquid-gas critical points exist in the quantum regime. Here we
study the quantum criticality in a binary Bose mixture undergoing the
liquid-gas transition. We show that, beyond a narrow stability window of the
self-bound liquid, a liquid-gas coexistence persists, which eventually transits
into a homogeneous mixture. Importantly, we identify two distinct critical
points where the liquid-gas coexistence terminates. These critical points are
characterized by rich critical behaviors in their vicinity, including divergent
susceptibility, unique phonon-mode softening, and enhanced density
correlations. The liquid-gas transition and the critical points can be readily
explored in ultracold atoms confined to a box potential. Our work unveils the
intriguing quantum liquid-gas criticality, and paves the way for further
studies of the rich many-body phenomena in quantum liquids.

<br>
Field theory arguments suggest the possibility of $\mathbb{Z}$-classification
of quantum spin Hall effect with magnetic flux tubes, that cause separation of
spin and charge degrees of freedom, and pumping of spin or Kramers pair.
However, the \emph{proof of principle} demonstration of spin-charge separation
is yet to be accomplished for realistic, \emph{ab initio} band structures of
spin-orbit-coupled materials, lacking spin-conservation law. In this work, we
perform thought experiments with magnetic flux tubes on $\beta$-bismuthene to
demonstrate spin-charge separation, and quantized pumping of spin for three
insulating states that can be accessed by tuning filling fractions. With a
combined analysis of momentum-space topology and real-space response, we
identify important role of topologically non-trivial bands, supporting even
integer winding numbers, which cannot be inferred from symmetry-based
indicators. Our work sets a new standard for prediction of two-dimensional,
quantum spin-Hall materials, based on precise bulk invariant and universal
topological response.

<br>
While renormalization group theory is a fully established method to capture
equilibrium phase transitions, the applicability of RG theory to universal
non-equilibrium behavior remains elusive. Here we address this question by
measuring the non-equilibrium dynamics triggered by a quench from superfluid to
thermal phase across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a 2D
Bose gas. We quench the system by splitting the 2D gas in two and probe the
relaxation dynamics by measuring the phase correlation function and vortex
density via matter-wave interferometry. The dynamics occur via a two-step
process of rapid phonon thermalization followed by slow dynamic vortex
unbinding. We demonstrate universal scaling laws for the algebraic exponents
and vortex density, supported by classical-field simulations, and show their
agreement with the real-time RG theory.
