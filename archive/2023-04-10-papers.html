<h3>Interaction of in-plane Drude carrier with c-axis phonon in $\rm  PdCoO_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04432</a>

We performed polarized reflection and transmission measurements on the
layered conducting oxide $\rm PdCoO_2$ thin films. For the ab-plane, an optical
peak near $\Omega$ $\approx$ 750 cm$^{-1}$ drives the scattering rate
$\gamma^{*}(\omega)$ and effective mass $m^{*}(\omega)$ of the Drude carrier to
increase and decrease respectively for $\omega$ $\geqq$ $\Omega$. For the
c-axis, a longitudinal optical phonon (LO) is present at $\Omega$ as evidenced
by a peak in the loss function Im[$-1/\varepsilon_{c}(\omega)$]. Further
polarized measurements in different light propagation (q) and electric field
(E) configurations indicate that the Peak at $\Omega$ results from an
electron-phonon coupling of the ab-plane carrier with the c-LO phonon, which
leads to the frequency-dependent $\gamma^{*}(\omega)$ and $m^{*}(\omega)$. This
unusual interaction was previously reported in high-temperature superconductors
(HTSC) between a non-Drude, mid-infrared band and a c-LO. On the contrary, it
is the Drude carrier that couples in $\rm PdCoO_2$. The coupling between the
ab-plane Drude carrier and c-LO suggests that the c-LO phonon may play a
significant role in the characteristic ab-plane electronic properties of $\rm
PdCoO_2$ including the ultra-high dc-conductivity, phonon-drag, and
hydrodynamic electron transport.

<h3>Discrete-to-Continuum Limits of Long-Range Electrical Interactions in  Nanostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03769</a>

We consider electrostatic interactions in two classes of nanostructures
embedded in a three dimensional space: (1) helical nanotubes, and (2) thin
films with uniform bending (i.e., constant mean curvature). Starting from the
atomic scale with a discrete distribution of dipoles, we obtain the continuum
limit of the electrostatic energy; the continuum energy depends on the
geometric parameters that define the nanostructure, such as the pitch and twist
of the helical nanotubes and the curvature of the thin film. We find that the
limiting energy is local in nature. This can be rationalized by noticing that
the decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run
over one and two dimensions, and is also consistent with prior work on
dimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit.
However, an interesting contrast between the discrete-to-continuum approach and
the continuum dimension reduction approaches is that the limit energy in the
latter depends only on the normal component of the dipole field, whereas in the
discrete-to-continuum approach, both tangential and normal components of the
dipole field contribute to the limit energy.

<h3>On melting of Boltzmann system of quantum hard spheres</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03770" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03770</a>

<i>S.M. Stishov</i>
<br>
<br>
Melting of a quantum system of hard spheres has been considered in the case
when the effects of Bose and Fermi statistics can be neglected. It has been
found that the quantum melting line always differs from the classical line with
exception for T=0, P=0, where the both lines crossed. It is shown that the
classical limit is not reachable at any finite temperatures.

<h3>On a Method of Treating Polar-Optical Phonons in Real Space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03772</a>
<br>
<i>David K Ferry</i>
<br>
<br>
Polar-optical phonon interactions with carriers in semiconductors are long
range interactions due to their Coulombic nature. Generally, if one wants to
treat these with non-equilibrium Green's functions, this long-range interaction
requires two- and three-particle Green's functions to be evaluated by e.g. the
Bethe-Salpeter equation. On the other hand, optical phonon scattering is
thought to be phase-breaking, which, if true, would eliminate this concern over
long-range interactions. In seeking to determine just to what extent phase
breaking is important, one could treat the polar modes as a real space
potential, as is done for impurities, and examine the occurrence of any such
correlations. This latter approach suffers from the condition that it is not
really known how to handle the polar modes in real space -- no one seems to
have done it. Here, such an approach is described as one possible method.

<h3>Spectral representation of Matsubara n-point functions: Exact kernel  functions and applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03774</a>
<br>
<i>Johannes Halbinger, Benedikt Schneider, Bj√∂rn Sbierski</i>
<br>
<br>
In the field of quantum many-body physics, the spectral (or Lehmann)
representation simplifies the calculation of Matsubara n-point correlation
functions if the eigensystem of a Hamiltonian is known. It is expressed via a
universal kernel function and a system- and correlator-specific product of
matrix elements. Here we provide the kernel functions in full generality, for
arbitrary n, arbitrary combinations of bosonic or fermionic operators and an
arbitrary number of anomalous terms. As an application, we consider bosonic 3-
and 4-point correlation functions for the fermionic Hubbard atom and a free
spin, respectively.

<h3>Effect of Pt vacancies on magnetotransport of Weyl semimetal candidate  GdPtSb epitaxial films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03811</a>
<br>
<i>Dongxue Du, Laxman Raju Thoutam, Konrad T. Genser, Chenyu Zhang, Karin M. Rabe, Bharat Jalan, Paul M. Voyles, Jason K. Kawasaki</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the effects of Pt vacancies on the magnetotransport properties of
Weyl semimetal candidate GdPtSb films, grown by molecular beam epitaxy on
c-plane sapphire. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and x-ray
diffraction measurements suggest that phase pure GdPt$_{x}$Sb films can
accommodate up to $15\%$ Pt vacancies ($x=0.85$), which act as acceptors as
measured by Hall effect. Two classes of electrical transport behavior are
observed. Pt-deficient films display a metallic temperature dependent
resistivity (d$\rho$/dT$>$0). The longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR, magnetic
field $\mathbf{B}$ parallel to electric field $\mathbf{E}$) is more negative
than transverse magnetoresistance (TMR, $\mathbf{B} \perp \mathbf{E}$),
consistent with the expected chiral anomaly for a Weyl semimetal. The
combination of Pt-vacancy disorder and doping away from the expected Weyl
nodes; however, suggests conductivity fluctuations may explain the negative LMR
rather than chiral anomaly. Samples closer to stoichiometry display the
opposite behavior: semiconductor-like resistivity (d$\rho$/dT$<$0) and more
negative transverse magnetoresistance than longitudinal magnetoresistance.
Hysteresis and other nonlinearities in the low field Hall effect and
magnetoresistance suggest that spin disorder scattering, and possible
topological Hall effect, may dominate the near stoichiometric samples. Our
findings highlight the complications of transport-based identification of Weyl
nodes, but point to possible topological spin textures in GdPtSb.

<h3>Frustrations on decorated triangular lattice in Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03818</a>
<br>
<i>F. A. Kassan-Ogly, A. V. Zarubin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the frustration properties of the Ising model on a decorated
triangular lattice with an arbitrary number of decorating spins on all lattice
bonds in the framework of an exact analytical approach based on the
Kramers--Wannier transfer matrix method. Expressions for the entropy, heat
capacity, and spontaneous magnetization of the lattice are obtained, including
the residual (zero-temperature) entropy and residual (zero-temperature)
spontaneous magnetization of the system. The existence of magnetic frustrations
in such a model and their influence on the behavior of the thermodynamic
functions of the system are shown. The new and most important result of our
study is related to the description of the possible coexistence of frustrations
and long-range magnetic order in partially ordered spin systems.

<h3>Thermoelectric properties of the Corbino disk in graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03827" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03827</a>
<br>
<i>Adam Rycerz, Katarzyna Rycerz, Piotr Witkowski</i>
<br>
<br>
Thermopower and the Lorentz number for an edge-free (Corbino) graphene disk
in the quantum Hall regime is calculated within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
formalism. We find, by varying the electrochemical potential, that amplitude of
the Seebeck coefficient follows a modified Goldsmid-Sharp relation, in which
energy gap is identified with the interval between zero-th and first Landau
level in bulk graphene. Analogous relation for the Lorentz number is also
determined. Therefore, these thermoelectric properties are solely defined by
the magnetic field, temperature, the Fermi velocity in graphene, and
fundamental constants including the electrons charge, the Planck and Boltzmann
constants, being independent on the system geometric dimensions. This suggests
that the Corbino disk in graphene may operate as a thermoelectric thermometer,
allowing to determine small temperature difference between two reservoirs, if
mean temperature and magnetic field are known.

<h3>Entropy-driven phase behavior of associative polymer networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03842" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03842</a>
<br>
<i>Lorenzo Rovigatti, Francesco Sciortino</i>
<br>
<br>
Polymer chains decorated with a fraction of monomers capable of forming
reversible bonds form transient polymer networks that are important in soft and
biological systems. If chains are flexible and the attractive monomers are all
of the same species, the network formation occurs continuously as density
increases. By contrast, it has been recently shown [L. Rovigatti and F.
Sciortino, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 047801 (2022)] that, if the attractive
monomers are of two different and alternating types, the entropic gain of
swapping intra-molecular bonds for inter-molecular connections induces a first
order phase transition in the fully-bonded (\textit{i.e.} low-temperature or,
equivalently, large monomer-monomer attraction strength) limit and the network
forms abruptly on increasing density. Here we use simulations to show that this
phenomenon is robust with respect to thermal fluctuations, disorder and change
in the polymer architecture, demonstrating its generality and likely relevance
for the wide class of materials that can be modelled as associative (transient)
polymer networks.

<h3>Renormalized Classical Theory of Quantum Magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03874" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03874</a>
<br>
<i>David Dahlbom, Hao Zhang, Zoha Laraib, Daniel M. Pajerowski, Kipton Barros, Cristian Batista</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive a renormalized classical spin (RCS) theory for $S > 1/2$ quantum
magnets by constraining a generalized classical theory that includes all
multipolar fluctuations to a reduced CP$^1$ phase space of dipolar SU($2$)
coherent states. In the special case that the spin Hamiltonian
$\hat{\cal{H}}^{S}$ is linear in the spin operators $\hat{\boldsymbol{S}}_j$
for each lattice site $j$, the RCS Hamiltonian $\tilde{\cal{H}}_{\rm cl}$
coincides with the usual classical model $\cal{H}_{\rm cl} =
\lim_{S\rightarrow\infty} \hat{\cal{H}}^S$. In the presence of single-ion
anisotropy terms or biquadratic interactions, however, the RCS theory is more
accurate than $\cal{H}_{\rm cl}$. Many real magnetic systems are well modeled
by spin Hamiltonians with strongly non-linear single-ion anisotropy terms. For
such systems, use of the RCS theory is essential to accurately model
thermodynamic phase diagrams and to extract the correct Hamiltonian parameters
from neutron scattering data

<h3>Morphological transitions of block copolymer micelles: implications for  isoporous membrane ordering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03900</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Isoporous membranes made from diblock copolymers have numerous applications,
including water treatment and protein separation, and are successfully produced
at a laboratory scale under controlled conditions. However, achieving optimal
conditions for membrane preparation remains a challenge due to the complexity
of the involved phenomena. Experimental studies have shown that the
self-assembly of block copolymers in solution significantly affects the final
membrane structure. Despite extensive research, understanding the multiscale
phenomena leading to the characteristic morphology is still elusive. We address
this gap by using mesoscale computational simulations to investigate the
self-assembly of block copolymers in selective solvents, consistent with
isoporous membrane preparation. We focus on the interplay between entropic and
enthalpic interactions and their effects on the morphology of the micellar
aggregates in solution. Our computational results are consistent with
experimental evidence, revealing a morphological transition of the aggregates
as the polymer concentration and solvent affinity change. We propose different
phase parameters to characterize the emergence of monodisperse-spherical
micelles in solution and describe the order of crew-cut micelles using a
rigid-sphere approximation. Our study provides valuable insights into the
self-assembly of diblock copolymers to optimize the preparation of isoporous
membranes.

<h3>Complexity in the hybridization physics revealed by depth-resolved  photoemission spectroscopy of single crystalline novel Kondo lattice systems,  CeCuX$_2$ (X = As/Sb)</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic structure of a novel Kondo lattice system
CeCuX2 (X = As/Sb) employing high resolution depth-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy of high quality single crystalline materials. CeCuSb2 and CeCuAs2
represent different regimes of the Doniach phase diagram exhibiting Kondo-like
transport properties and CeCuSb2 is antiferromagnetic (TN ~ 6.9 K) while
CeCuAs$_2$ does not show long-range magnetic order down to the lowest
temperature studied. In this study, samples were cleaved in ultrahigh vacuum
before the photoemission measurements and the spectra at different surface
sensitivity establish the pnictogen layer having squarenet structure as the
terminated surface which is weakly bound to the other layers. Cu 2p and As 2p
spectra show spin-orbit split sharp peaks along with features due to plasmon
excitations. Ce 3d spectra exhibit multiple features due to the hybridization
of the Ce 4f/5d states with the valence states. While overall lineshape of the
bulk spectral functions look similar in both the cases, the surface spectra are
very different; the surface-bulk difference is significantly weaker in CeCuAs2
compared to that observed in CeCuSb2. A distinct low binding energy peak is
observed in the Ce 3d spectra akin to the scenario observed in cuprates and
manganites due to the Zhang-Rice singlets and/or high degree of itineracy of
the conduction holes. The valence band spectra of CeCuSb$_2$ manifest highly
metallic phase. In CeCuAs2, intensity at the Fermi level is significantly small
suggesting a pseudogap-type behavior. These results bring out an interesting
scenario emphasizing the importance and subtlety of hybridization physics
underlying the exoticity of this novel Kondo system.

<h3>Genuine Dirac half-metal: A 2D d0-type ferromagnet Mg4N4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03919" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03919</a>
<br>
<i>Jialin Gong, Guangqian Ding, Chengwu Xie, Jianhua Wang, Ying Liu, Xiaotian Wang, Gang Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
When the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is absent, almost all the proposed
half-metals with the twofold degenerate nodal points at the K (or K') in
two-dimensional (2D) materials are misclassified as "Dirac half-metals" owing
to the way graphene was utilized in the earliest studies. Actually, each band
crossing point at K or K' is described by a 2D Weyl Hamiltonian with definite
chirality; hence, it must be a Weyl point. To the best of our knowledge, there
have been no reports of a genuine (i.e., fourfold degenerate) Dirac point
half-metal in 2D yet. In this Letter, we proposed for the first time that the
2D d0-type ferromagnet Mg4N4 is a genuine Dirac half-metal with a fourfold
degenerate Dirac point at the S high-symmetry point, intrinsic magnetism, high
Curie temperature, 100% spin-polarization, robustness to the SOC and uniaxial
and biaxial strains, and 100% spin-polarized edge states. The work can be seen
as a starting point for future predictions of intrinsically magnetic materials
with genuine Dirac points, which will aid the frontier of topo-spintronics
researchers.

<h3>Layer-resolved electronic behavior in a Kondo lattice system, CeAgAs2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03921" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03921</a>
<br>
<i>Sawani Datta, Ram Prakash Pandeya, Arka Bikash Dey, A. Gloskovskii, C. Schlueter, T. R. F. Peixoto, Ankita Singh, A. Thamizhavel, Kalobaran Maiti</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic structure of an antiferromagnetic Kondo lattice
system CeAgAs2 employing hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. CeAgAs2, an
orthorhombic variant of HfCuSi2 structure, exhibits antiferromagnetic ground
state, Kondo like resistivity upturn and compensation of magnetic moments at
low temperatures. The photoemission spectra obtained at different photon
energies suggest termination of the cleaved surface at cis-trans-As layers. The
depth-resolved data show significant surface-bulk differences in the As and Ce
core level spectra. The As 2p bulk spectrum shows distinct two peaks
corresponding to two different As layers. The peak at higher binding energy
correspond to cis-trans-As layers and is weakly hybridized with the adjacent Ce
layers. The As layers between Ce and Ag-layers possess close to trivalent
configuration due to strong hybridization with the neighboring atoms and the
corresponding feature appear at lower binding energy. Ce 3d core level spectra
show multiple features reflecting strong Ce-As hybridization and strong
correlation. Intense f0 peak is observed in the surface spectrum while it is
insignificant in the bulk. In addition, we observe a features at binding energy
lower than the well-screened feature indicating the presence of additional
interactions. This feature becomes more intense in the bulk spectra suggesting
it to be a bulk property. Increase in temperature leads to a spectral weight
transfer to higher binding energies in the core level spectra and a depletion
of spectral intensity at the Fermi level as expected in a Kondo material. These
results reveal interesting surface-bulk differences, complex interplay of
intra- and inter-layer covalency, and electron correlation in the electronic
structure of this novel Kondo lattice system.

<h3>Mechanical photoluminescence excitation spectra of a strongly driven  spin-mechanical system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03922</a>
<br>
<i>Xinzhu Li, Hailin Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We report experimental studies of a driven spin-mechanical system, in which a
nitrogen vacancy (NV) center couples to out-of-plane vibrations of a diamond
cantilever through the excited-state deformation potential. Photoluminescence
excitation studies show that in the unresolved sideband regime and under strong
resonant mechanical driving, the excitation spectra of a NV optical transition
feature two spectrally sharp peaks, corresponding to the two turning points of
the oscillating cantilever. In the limit that the strain-induced frequency
separation between the two peaks far exceeds the NV zero-phonon linewidth, the
spectral position of the individual peak becomes sensitive to minute detuning
between the mechanical resonance and the external driving force. For a fixed
optical excitation frequency near the NV transition, NV fluorescence as a
function of mechanical detuning features resonances with a linewidth that can
be orders of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic linewidth of the mechanical
mode. This enhanced sensitivity to mechanical detuning can potentially provide
an effective mechanism for mechanical sensing, for example, mass sensing via
measurements of induced changes in the mechanical oscillator frequency.

<h3>Equilibrium distribution and diffusion of mixed hydrogen-methane gas in  gravity field</h3>

<i>Shiyao Peng, Qiao He, Ducheng Peng, Xin Ouyang, Xiaorui Zhang, Chong Chai, Lianlai Zhang, Xu Sun, Huiqiu Deng, Wangyu Hu, Jie Hou</i>
<br>
<br>
Repurposing existing natural gas pipelines is a promising solution for
large-scale transportation of mixed hydrogen-methane gas. However, it remains
debatable whether gravitational stratification can notably affect hydrogen
partial pressure in the gas mixture. To address this issue, we combined
molecular dynamics simulation with thermodynamic and diffusion theories. Our
study systematically examined the equilibrium distribution of hydrogen-methane
mixtures in gravity fields. We demonstrated that partial pressures of both
gases decrease with altitude, with hydrogen showing slower decrease due to its
smaller molar mass. As a result, the volume fraction of hydrogen is maximized
at the top end of pipes. The stratification is more favorable at low
temperature and large altitude drops, with notable gas stratification only
occurring at extremely large drops in altitude, being generally negligible even
at a drop of 1500 m. Furthermore, we showed that the diffusion time required to
achieve the equilibrium distribution is proportional to gas pressure and the
square of pipeline height. This requires approximately 300 years for a 1500 m
pipeline at 1 bar. Therefore, temporary interruptions in pipeline gas
transportation will not cause visible stratification. Our work clarifies the
effect of gravity on hydrogen-methane gas mixtures and provides quantitative
insights into assessing the stratification of gas mixtures in pipelines.

<br>
The observation and description of collective excitations in solids is a
fundamental issue when seeking to understand the physics of a many-body system.
Analysis of these excitations is usually carried out by measuring the dynamical
structure factor, S(Q, $\omega$), with inelastic neutron or x-ray scattering
techniques and comparing this against a calculated dynamical model. Here, we
develop an artificial intelligence framework which combines a neural network
trained to mimic simulated data from a model Hamiltonian with automatic
differentiation to recover unknown parameters from experimental data. We
benchmark this approach on a Linear Spin Wave Theory (LSWT) simulator and
advanced inelastic neutron scattering data from the square-lattice spin-1
antiferromagnet La$_2$NiO$_4$. We find that the model predicts the unknown
parameters with excellent agreement relative to analytical fitting. In doing
so, we illustrate the ability to build and train a differentiable model only
once, which then can be applied in real-time to multi-dimensional scattering
data, without the need for human-guided peak finding and fitting algorithms.
This prototypical approach promises a new technology for this field to
automatically detect and refine more advanced models for ordered quantum
systems.

<h3>Emergent Superconductivity and Competing Charge Orders in Hole-Doped  Square-Lattice $t$-$J$ Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03963" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03963</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Lu, Feng Chen, W. Zhu, D. N. Sheng, Shou-Shu Gong</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent large-scale numerical simulations on the square-lattice $t$-$J$ model
demonstrate unconventional $d$-wave superconductivity on the electron-doped
side but a dominant charge density wave (CDW) order on the hole-doped side,
which is inconsistent with the high-$T_c$ superconductivity of hole-doped
cuprate compounds. To address this issue, we systematically study the
square-lattice $t$-$J$ model with a moderate ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor
($t_2$) to the nearest-neighbor ($t_1$) electron hopping $t_2/t_1$ modeling
electron-doped ($t_2>0$) and hole-doped ($t_2<0$) cuprates, by employing the
state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations. On 6-leg
cylindrical system, while different CDW phases are identified on the hole-doped
side for the doping range $\delta= 1/16-1/8$, a superconducting (SC) phase
emerges at lower doping regime, where the pairing correlations exhibit a
power-law decay with $d$-wave symmetry. On the wider 8-leg system, the $d$-wave
SC also emerges on the hole-doped side at the optimal $1/8$ doping,
demonstrating a change of the ground-state nature by increasing system width.
Our results highlight rich possibilities for the emergence of superconductivity
in the general $t$-$J$ model through weakening the competing charge orders,
which could lead to a unified understanding of both hole- and electron-doped
cuprate superconductors.

<h3>Possible high-temperature magnetically topological material  Mn$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Mn-Bi-Te family displaying magnetism and non-trivial topological
properties has received extensive attention. Here, we predict that the
antiferromagnetic structure of Mn$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$ with three MnTe layers
is energetically stable and the magnetic coupling strength of Mn-Mn is enhanced
four times compared with that in the single MnTe layer of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$.
The predicted N\'eel transition point is higher than 77 K, the liquid-nitrogen
temperature. The topological properties show that with the variation of the
MnTe layer from a single layer to three layers, the system transforms from a
nontrivial topological phase to a trivial topological phase. Interestingly, the
ferromagnetic state of Mn$_{3}$Bi$_{2}$Te$_{6}$ is a topological semimetal and
it exhibits a topological transition from trivial to nontrivial induced by the
magnetic transition. Our results enrich the Mn-Bi-Te family system, offer a new
platform for studying topological phase transitions, and pave a new way to
improve the working temperature of magnetically topological devices.

In this report, the evolution of the local atomic structure of the Zr50Nb50
melt was investigated by applying temperature (2600 to 300 K) and pressure (0
to 50 Gpa) using classical molecular dynamics simulations. To gain clear
insight into the structural evolution during quenching, we used various methods
of structural analysis such as the radial distribution function g(r),
coordination number, bond angle distribution, and Voronoi tessellation. We
found that the icosahedral motifs (which are the signature of the short-range
ordering) and distorted BCC-like clusters dominate in the liquid and glass
region under 0 and 5 Gpa external pressure. A first-order phase transition to a
crystal-like structure was observed at 10, 15, and 20 Gpa external pressure at
1400, 1500, and 1600 K, respectively. Before the first-order phase transition,
the system was dominated by icosahedral and distorted BCC-like clusters. When
the temperature is lowered further below the glass transition at 10,15, and 20
Gpa external pressure, all structural analyses show that the solidified system
consists mainly of body-centered cubic-like clusters in the case of our
specific cooling rate of 1012 K/s.

It is well known that noncommutative geometry naturally emerges in the
quantum Hall states due to the presence of strong and constant magnetic fields.
Here, we discuss the underlying noncommutative geometry of quantum Hall fluids
in which the magnetic fields are spatially inhomogenoeus. We analyze these
cases by employing symplectic geometry and Fedosov's deformation quantization,
which rely on symplectic connections and Fedosov star-product. Through this
formalism, we unveil some new features concerning the static limit of the
Haldane's unimodular metric and the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra of the
density operators, which plays a central role in the fractional quantum Hall
effect.

A simple stochastic model of solute drag by moving grain boundaries (GBs) is
presented. Using a small number of parameters, the model describes solute
interactions with GBs and captures nonlinear GB dynamics, solute saturation in
the segregation atmosphere, and the breakaway from the atmosphere. The model is
solved by kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC) simulations with time-dependent transition
barriers. The non-Markovian nature of the KMC process is discussed. In Part I
of this work, the model is applied to planar GBs driven by an external force.
The model reproduces all basic features of the solute drag effect, including
the maximum of the drag force at a critical GB velocity. The force-velocity
functions obtained depart from the scaling predicted by the classical models by
Cahn and L\"ucke-St\"uwe, which are based on more restrictive assumptions. The
paper sets the stage for Part II, in which the GB will be treated as a 2D
solid-on-solid interface.

In Part I of this work, we proposed a stochastic model describing solute
interactions with stationary and moving grain boundaries (GBs) and applied it
to planar GBs in 1D systems. The model reproduces nonlinear GB dynamics, solute
saturation in the segregation atmosphere, and all basic features of the solute

solid-on-solid interfaces. The model predicts a GB roughening transition in
stationary GBs and reversible dynamic roughening in moving GBs. The impacts of
the GB roughening on GB migration mechanisms, GB mobility, and the solute drag
are studied in detail. The threshold effect in GB dynamics is explained by the
dynamic roughening transition, which is amplified in the presence of solute
segregation. The simulation results are compared with the classical models by

Topological indices, such as winding numbers, have been conventionally used
to predict the number of topologically protected edge states (TPES) in
topological insulators. In this Letter, we experimentally observe its breakdown
in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices with beyond-nearest-neighbor

<h3>Novel entropy-stabilized fluorite oxides with multifunctional properties</h3>

Development of new high-entropy oxides having configurational entropy
dominating the phase stability has become a hot topic since the discovery of
rock salt structure entropy-stabilized (ES)(MgCoNiCuZn)O in 2015. Herein, we
report a set of novel entropy-stabilized fluorite oxides:
Zr0.2Hf0.2Ce0.2Sn0.2Mn0.2O2-{\delta}, Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Mn0.2Ce0.2O2-{\delta},
Zr0.225Hf0.225Ti0.225Mn0.225Ce0.1O2-{\delta}, and
Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Mn0.2Ce0.1Ta0.05Fe0.05O2-{\delta} synthesized using standard
solid-state reaction. These compounds have been investigated using X-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
techniques to discern their structural, microstructural, and chemical
properties. The configurational-entropy dominated phase stability and hence the
entropy stabilization of the compounds is confirmed by cyclic heat treatments.
The mismatch in the ionic radii and oxidation state of the cations are the key
factors in achieving a single-phase fluorite structure. Further, screening of
physical properties including thermal conductivity, optical band gap, magnetic
properties, and impedance spectroscopy is discussed. Thermal conductivity of
1.4-1.7 Wm-1K-1 is observed at 300 K and remains mostly invariant across a wide
temperature range (300K-1073K), favorable for thermal barrier coating
applications. These ES samples have an optical band gap of 1.6-1.8 eV, enabling
light absorption across the visible spectrum and hence could be promising for
photocatalytic applications. The impedance spectroscopy data of the
entropy-stabilized samples reveal the presence of electronic contributions with
small activation energy (0.3-0.4 eV) across a temperature range of 298K-423K.
These observations in ES fluorite systems show potential for their
multifunctional applications via further optimization and confirm the great
chemical versatility of entropy-stabilized oxides.

<h3>Anomalous Polarization Reversal in Strained Thin Films of CuInP$_2$S$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strain-induced transitions of polarization reversal in thin films of a
ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ (CIPS) with ideally-conductive electrodes is
explored using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach with an
eighth-order free energy expansion in polarization powers. Due to multiple
potential wells, the height and position of which are temperature- and
strain-dependent, the energy profiles of CIPS can flatten in the vicinity of
the non-zero polarization states. This behavior differentiates these materials
from classical ferroelectrics with the first or second order
ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, for which potential energy
profiles can be shallow or flat near the transition point only, corresponding
to zero spontaneous polarization. Thereby we reveal an unusually strong effect
of the mismatch strain on the out-of-plane polarization reversal, hysteresis
loops shape, dielectric susceptibility, and piezoelectric response of CIPS
films. In particular, by varying the sign of the mismatch strain and its
magnitude in a narrow range, quasi-static hysteresis-less paraelectric curves
can transform into double, triple, and other types of pinched and single
hysteresis loops. The strain effect on the polarization reversal is opposite,
i.e., "anomalous", in comparison with many other ferroelectric films in that
the out-of-plane remanent polarization and coercive field increases strongly
for tensile strains, meanwhile the polarization decreases or vanish for
compressive strains. We explain the effect by "inverted" signs of linear and
nonlinear electrostriction coupling coefficients of CIPS and their strong
temperature dependence. For definite values of temperature and mismatch strain,
the low-frequency hysteresis loops of polarization may exhibit negative slope
in the relatively narrow range of external field amplitude and frequency.

<h3>Predicting Polymer Brush Behavior in Solvents using the  Steepest-Entropy-Ascent Quantum Thermodynamic Framework</h3>

<br>
<br>
The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework is
utilized to study the effects of temperature on polymer brushes. The brushes
are represented by a discrete energy spectrum and energy degeneracies obtained
through the Replica-Exchange Wang-Landau algorithm. The SEAQT equation of
motion is applied to the energy landscape to establish a unique kinetic path
from an initial thermodynamic state to a stable equilibrium state. The kinetic
path describes the brush's evolution in state space as it interacts with a
thermal reservoir. The predicted occupation probabilities along the kinetic
path are used to determine expected thermodynamic and structural properties.
The brush density of a polystyrene brush in cyclohexane solvent is predicted
using the equation of motion and demonstrates qualitative agreement with
experimental density profiles. The Flory-Huggins parameter chosen to describe
brush-solvent interactions affects the solvent distribution in the brush but
has minimal impact on the brush density. Three types of non-equilibrium kinetic
paths are considered, i.e., a heating path, a cooling path, and a
heating-cooling path, differing in their entropy production, with properties
such as tortuosity, radius of gyration, brush density, solvent density, and
brush chain conformations calculated for each path.

<h3>An Automated Fully-Computational Framework to Construct Printability  Maps for Additively Manufactured Metal Alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
In additive manufacturing, the optimal processing conditions need to be
determined to fabricate porosity-free parts. For this purpose, the design space
for an arbitrary alloy needs to be scoped and analyzed to identify the areas of
defects for different laser power-scan speed combinations and can be visualized
using a printability map. Constructing printability maps is typically a costly
process due to the involvement of experiments, which restricts their
application in high-throughput product design. To reduce the cost and effort of
constructing printability maps, a fully computational framework is introduced
in this work. The framework combines CALPHAD models and a reduced-order model
to predict material properties. THen, an analytical thermal model, known as the
Eagar-Tsai model, utilizes some of these materials' properties to calculate the
melt pool geometry during the AM processes. In the end, printability maps are
constructed using material properties, melt pool dimensions, and commonly used
criteria for lack of fusion, balling, and keyholing defects. To validate the
framework and its general application to laser powder-bed fusion alloys, five
common additive manufacturing alloys are analyzed. Furthermore, NiTi-based
alloys at three different compositions are evaluated to show the further
extension of the framework to alloy systems at different compositions. The
defect regions in these printability maps are validated with corresponding
experimental observations to compare and benchmark the defect criteria and find
the optimal criterion set with the maximum accuracy for each unique material
composition. Furthermore, printability maps for NiTi that are obtained from our
framework are used in conjunction with process maps resulting from a
multi-model framework to guide the fabrication of defect-free additive
manufactured parts with tailorable properties and performance.

<br>

We study analytically and numerically on lattices containing $10^5$ spins,
the integral absorption of microwaves by a random-anisotropy magnet, $\int
d\omega P(\omega)$. It scales as $D^2_R/J$ on the random-anisotropy strength
$D_R$ and the strength of the ferromagnetic exchange $J$ in low-anisotropy
amorphous magnetic materials. At high anisotropy and in low-anisotropy
materials sintered of sufficiently large ferromagnetic grains, the integral
power scales linearly on $D_R$. The maximum bandwidth, combined with the
maximum absorption power, is achieved when the amorphous structure factor, or
grain size, is of an order of the domain wall thickness in a conventional
ferromagnet that is of the order of $(J/D_R)^{1/2}$ lattice spacings.

Designing alloys for additive manufacturing (AM) presents significant
opportunities. Still, the chemical composition and processing conditions
required for printability (ie., their suitability for fabrication via AM) are
challenging to explore using solely experimental means. In this work, we
develop a high-throughput (HTP) computational framework to guide the search for
highly printable alloys and appropriate processing parameters. The framework
uses material properties from state-of-the-art databases, processing
parameters, and simulated melt pool profiles to predict process-induced
defects, such as lack-of-fusion, keyholing, and balling. We accelerate the
printability assessment using a deep learning surrogate for a thermal model,
enabling a 1,000-fold acceleration in assessing the printability of a given
alloy at no loss in accuracy when compared with conventional physics-based
thermal models. We verify and validate the framework by constructing
printability maps for the CoCrFeMnNi Cantor alloy system and comparing our
predictions to an exhaustive 'in-house' database. The framework enables the
systematic investigation of the printability of a wide range of alloys in the
broader Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni HEA system. We identified the most promising alloys that
were suitable for high-temperature applications and had the narrowest
solidification ranges, and that was the least susceptible to balling,
hot-cracking, and the formation of macroscopic printing defects. A new metric
for the global printability of an alloy is constructed and is further used for
the ranking of candidate alloys. The proposed framework is expected to be
integrated into ICME approaches to accelerate the discovery and optimization of
novel high-performance, printable alloys.

<br>
The commercial and industrial demand for the solution of hard combinatorial
optimization problems push forward the development of efficient solvers. One of
them is the Ising machine which can solve combinatorial problems mapped to
Ising Hamiltonians. In particular, spintronic hardware implementations of Ising
machines can be very efficient in terms of area and performance, and are
relatively low-cost considering the potential to create hybrid CMOS-spintronic
technology. Here, we perform a comparison of coherent and probabilistic
paradigms of Ising machines on several hard Max-Cut instances, analyzing their
scalability and performance at software level. We show that probabilistic Ising
machines outperform coherent Ising machines in terms of the number of
iterations required to achieve the problem s solution. Nevertheless, high
frequency spintronic oscillators with sub-nanosecond synchronization times
could be very promising as ultrafast Ising machines. In addition, considering
that a coherent Ising machine acts better for Max-Cut problems because of the
absence of the linear term in the Ising Hamiltonian, we introduce a procedure
to encode Max-3SAT to Max-Cut. We foresee potential synergic interplays between
the two paradigms.

We theoretically describe the two-electron four-level double quantum dot
(DQD) tunnel-coupled to a fermionic sea by using the rate-equation formalism.
This approach allows to find occupation probabilities of each DQD level in a
relatively simple way, compared to other methods. Calculated dependencies were
compared with the experimental results. The system under study is irradiated by
a strong driving signal and as a result one can observe
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry patterns which are
successfully described by the considered formalism. The system operation regime
depends on the amplitude of the excitation signal and the energy detuning, so
one can transfer the system to the necessary quantum state in the most
efficient way by setting these parameters. Obtained results give useful
insights about initializing, characterizing and controlling the system quantum
states.

<br>
<br>
The advancement of two-dimensional polar metals tends to be limited by the
incompatibility between electric polarity and metallicity as well as dimension
reduction. Here, we report polar and metallic Janus monolayers of MoSi$_2$N$_4$
family by breaking the out-of-plane (OOP) structural symmetry through Z (P/As)
substitution of N. Despite the semiconducting nature of MoSi$_2$X$_4$
(X=N/P/As), four Janus MoSi$_2$N$_{x}$Z$_{4-x}$ monolayers are found to be
polar metals owing to the weak coupling between the conducting electrons and
electric polarity. The metallicity is originated from the Z substitution
induced delocalization of occupied electrons in Mo-d orbitals. The OOP electric
polarizations around 10$-$203 pC/m are determined by the asymmetric OOP charge
distribution due to the non-centrosymmetric Janus structure. The corresponding
OOP piezoelectricity is further revealed as high as 39$-$153 pC/m and
0.10$-$0.31 pm/V for piezoelectric strain and stress coefficients,
respectively. The results demonstrate polar metallicity and high OOP
piezoelectricity in Janus MoSi$_2$N$_{x}$Z$_{4-x}$ monolayers and open new
vistas for exploiting unusual coexisting properties in monolayers derived from
MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family.

We prove the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) for local observables

<br>
<br>
The chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is a fascinating
phenomena correlating molecular structure with electron spin-polarisation in
excited state measurements. Experimental procedures to quantify the
spin-filtering magnitude relies generally on averaging data sets, especially
those from magnetic field dependent conductive-AFM. We investigate the
underlying observed disorder in the IV spectra and the origin of spikes
superimposed. We demonstrate and explain that a dynamic, voltage sweep rate
dependent, phenomena can give rise to complex IV curves for chiral crystals of
coronene bisimide. The redox group, able to capture localized charge states,
acts as an impurity state interfering with a continuum, giving rise to Fano
resonances. We introduce a novel mechanism for the dynamic transport which
might also provide insight into the role of spin-polarization. Crucially,
interference between charge localisation and delocalisation during transport
may be important properties into understanding the CISS phenomena.

<h3>On the half-quantized Hall conductance of massive surface electrons in  magnetic topological insulator films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04229</a>
<br>
<i>Rui Chen, Shun-Qing Shen</i>
<br>
<br>
In topological insulators, massive surface bands resulting from local
symmetry breaking are believed to exhibit a half-quantized Hall conductance.
However, such scenarios are obviously inconsistent with the
Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem, which states that a single band in a
lattice with a finite Brillouin zone can only have an integer-quantized Hall
conductance. To explore this, we investigate the band structures of a lattice
model describing the magnetic topological insulator film that supports the
axion insulator, Chern insulator, and semi-magnetic topological insulator
phases. We reveal that the gapped and gapless surface bands in the three phases
are characterized by an integer-quantized Hall conductance and a half-quantized
Hall conductance, respectively. This result is distinct from the previous
consensus that the gapped surface band is responsible for the half-quantized
Hall conductance and the gapless band should exhibit zero Hall response. We
propose an effective model to describe the three phases and show that the
low-energy dispersion of the surface bands inherits from the surface Dirac
fermions. The gapped surface band manifests a nearly half-quantized Hall
conductance at low energy near the center of Brillouin zone, but is compensated
by another nearly half-quantized Hall conductance at high energy near the
boundary of Brillouin zone because a single band can only have an
integer-quantized Hall conductance. The gapless state hosts a zero Hall
conductance at low energy but is compensated by another half-quantized Hall
conductance at high energy, and thus the half-quantized Hall conductance can
only originate from the gapless band. Moreover, we calculate the layer-resolved
Hall conductance of the system. The conclusion suggests that the individual
gapped surface band alone does not support the half-quantized surface Hall
effect in a lattice model.

<h3>Planck constants in quantum gravity</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The theory of quantum gravity, in which tetrads emerge as the bilinear
combinations of the fermionic field, suggests that in general relativity the
interval $ds$ is dimensionless. Several other approaches to quantum gravity,
including the model of superplastic vacuum and $BF$-theories of gravity support
this suggestion. The important consequence of such metric dimension is that all
the diffeomorphism invariant quantities are dimensionless for any dimension of
spacetime. These include the action $S$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$,
scalar curvature $R$, scalar field $\Phi$, wave function $\psi$, etc. The
composite fermion approach to quantum gravity suggests that the Planck constant
$\hbar$ can be the parameter of the Minkowski metric. Here we extend this
suggestion by introducing two Planck constants, bar h and slash h, which are
the parameters of the correspondingly time component and space component of the
Minkowski metric. The parameters bar h and slash h are invariant only under
$SO(3)$ transformations, and thus they are not diffeomorphism invariant. As a
result they have nonzero dimensions -- the dimension of time for bar h and
dimension of length for slash h. Then according to the Weinberg criterion these
parameters are not fundamental, and may vary. They also change sign at the
topological domain walls resulting from the symmetry breaking.

<h3>Thermodynamic crossovers in supercritical fluids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Can liquid-like and gas-like states be distinguished beyond the critical
point, where the liquid-gas phase transition no longer exists and
conventionally only a single supercritical fluid phase is defined? Recent
experiments and simulations report strong evidence of dynamical crossovers
above the critical temperature and pressure. Despite using different criteria,
existing theoretical explanations generally consider a single crossover line
separating liquid-like and gas-like states in the supercritical fluid phase. We
argue that such a single-line scenario is inconsistent with the supercritical
behavior of the Ising model, which has two crossover lines due to its symmetry,
violating the universality principle of critical phenomena. To reconcile the
inconsistency, we define two thermodynamic crossover lines in supercritical
fluids as boundaries of liquid-like, indistinguishable and gas-like states.
Near the critical point, the two crossover lines follow critical scalings with
exponents of the Ising universality class, supported by calculations of
theoretical models and analyses of experimental data from the standard
database. The upper line agrees with crossovers independently estimated from
the inelastic X-ray scattering data of supercritical argon, and from the
small-angle neutron scattering data of supercritical carbon dioxide. The lower
line is verified by the equation of states for the compressibility factor. This
work provides a fundamental framework for understanding supercritical physics
in general phase transitions.

We recast the problem of hydrogel swelling under physical constraints as an
energy optimization problem. We apply this approach to compute equilibrium
shapes of hydrogel spheres confined within a jammed matrix of rigid beads, and
interpret the results to determine how confinement modifies the mechanics of
swollen hydrogels. In contrast to the unconfined case, we find a spatial
separation of strains within the bulk of the hydrogel as strain becomes
localized to an outer region. We also explore the contact mechanics of the gel,
finding a transition from Hertzian behavior to non-Hertzian behavior as a
function of swelling. Our model, implemented in the Morpho shape optimization
environment, can be applied in any dimension, readily adapted to diverse
swelling scenarios and extended to use other energies in conjunction.

Complex, concentrated, multi-component alloys have been shown to display
outstanding thermo-mechanical properties, that have been typically attributed
to sluggish diffusion, entropic, and lattice distortion effects. Here, we
investigate two metal alloys with such exemplary properties, the equiatomic,
single-phase, face-centered-cubic (FCC) alloys NiCoCr and NiCoCrFeMn, and we
compare their microstructural kinetics to the behaviors in a pure-Ni FCC metal.
We perform long-time, kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, and we analyze in
detail the kinetics of atomic vacancies. We find that vacancies in both
concentrated alloys exhibit subdiffusive thermally driven dynamics, in direct
contrast to the diffusive dynamics of pure Ni. Subdiffusive dynamics shall be
attributed to dynamical sluggishness, that is modeled by a fractional Brownian
random walk. Furthermore, we analyze the statistics of waiting times, and we
interpret long power-law-distributed rest periods as a direct consequence of
barriers' energy-scales and lattice distortions.

<h3>Computational exploration of a viable route to Kitaev-quantum spin  liquid phase in OsCl$_3$</h3>

In this computational study, we explore a viable route to access the
Kitaev-Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) state in a so-called spin-orbit assisted Mott
insulator OsCl$_3$. QSL state is stabilized in a substantial part of the
Hubbard $U$--Hund's $J_\text{H}$ space of the quantum phase diagram obtained by
combining second-order perturbation and pseudo-Fermion renormalization group
calculations. Considering monolayer of recently synthesized OsCl$_3$ as a case
study, we show that for small $J_\text{H}$/$U$, only Kitaev interaction
appears, albeit of smaller magnitude. Depending upon the nature of magnetic
interactions, the phase diagram also hosts other magnetic phases as well in
different regions. Negligibly small farther neighbor interactions appears as a
distinct feature of monolayer OsCl$_3$. Insights from our study may be helpful
in designing experiments on pertinent Kitaev-QSL candidate materials.

<br>
<br>
Recently created self-bound quantum droplets of binary Bose mixtures open
intriguing possibilities for the study of impurity physics. We show that the
properties of impurities embedded in quasi-one-dimensional droplets are
determined by the interplay between back-action and quantum fluctuations. Due
to such back-action, repulsive impurities may form a metastable quasi-bound
state inside the droplet. In contrast, attractive impurities remain bound to
the droplet, leading to the hybridization of droplet and impurity excitations,
as well as to peculiar scattering resonances. Interestingly, impurity trapping
may result solely from the effect of quantum fluctuations. These results may
readily be probed experimentally by doping the currently available droplets of
binary mixtures.

Neodymium nickelates have attracted research interest due to their strongly
correlated behaviour and remarkable magnetic properties. More importantly,
superconductivity has recently been confirmed in thin-film samples of Sr-doped
NdNiO2, bringing the layered rare earth nickel oxides into the research
spotlight. In this report, we present results on a series of NdNiO2 analogues,
NdxPr4-xNi3O8 (x = 0.1, 0.25, 1, 2, and 4) obtained by topotactic reduction, in
which we observe systematic changes in the magnetic behaviour. As the Nd3+
content increases, the initially large spin-freezing region with magnetic
frustration becomes smaller and gradually shifts to low temperatures, while the
magnetic response gradually increases. The muon-spin spectroscopy measurements
on Nd4Ni3O8 show that this phenomenon is likely due to the enhancement of spin
fluctuations in NdxPr4-xNi3O8, which weakens the spin frustration behaviour for
high Nd3+ contents and at low temperatures. These spin fluctuations can be
caused by both Nd and Ni ions and could be one of the factors determining the
occurrence of possible superconductivity.

<br>
<br>
In this work we perform real time simulations for the dynamics of braiding a
pair of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) through a quantum dot in a minimal setup of
pure 1D realization. We reveal the strong nonadiabatic effect when the dot
energy level approaches to zero in order to achieve a geometric phase $\pi/4$
which is required for a full exchange between the MZMs. Rather than the
strategies of nonuniformly manipulating the system according to adiabatic
condition and shortcuts-to-adiabaticity, we propose and illustrate a more
feasible scheme to suppress the nonadiabatic transition, meanwhile which allows
for a full exchange between the Majorana modes.

<br>
<br>
The effective mass at the Fermi level is measured in the strongly interacting
two-dimensional (2D) electron system in ultra-clean SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells
in the low-temperature limit in tilted magnetic fields. At low electron
densities, the effective mass is found to be strongly enhanced and independent
of the degree of spin polarization, which indicates that the mass enhancement
is not related to the electrons' spins. The observed effect turns out to be
universal for silicon-based 2D electron systems, regardless of random
potential, and cannot be explained by existing theories.

After the reported discovery of room-temperature superconductivity at only 1
GPa in nitrogendoped lutetium trihydride and the resulting heated discussions,
there is an urgent need to reproduce the results and synthesis of this

starting from pure Lu to produce very stable trigonal LuH3 which was
subsequently pressurised to 2 GPa with a dilute N2/He rich pressure medium.
Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to characterise the

<h3>Magneto-optical Kerr effect in ferroelectric antiferromagnetic  two-dimensional heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) of the two-dimensional
heterostructure CrI3/In2Se3/CrI3 by using density functional theory
calculations and symmetry analysis. The spontaneous polarization in the In2Se3
ferroelectric layer and the antiferromagnetic ordering in CrI3 layers break the
mirror symmetry and the timereversal symmetry, thus activating MOKE. We show
that the Kerr angle can be switched by either the polarization or the
antiferromagnetic order parameter. Our results suggest that ferroelectric and
antiferromagnetic 2D heterostructures could be exploited for ultra-compact
information storage devices, where the information is encoded by the two
ferroelectric or the two time-reversed antiferromagnetic states, and the
read-out performed optically by MOKE.

The axion is a hypothetical particle, a promising candidate for dark matter,
and a solution to the strong CP problem. Axion haloscope search experiments
deal with a signal power comparable to noise uncertainty at millikelvin
temperature. We use a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) with the
aim of approaching a noise level near the theoretically allowed limit of half
quanta. In our measurements to characterize the JPA we have found the added
noise to the system with a JPA as the first-stage amplifier to be lower than
110 mK at the frequencies from 0.938 GHz to 0.963 GHz.

<h3>The two-channel Kondo effect in coupled interacting helical liquids</h3>

<br>
<i>Sourav Biswas, Alessandro De Martino, Sumathi Rao, Arijit Kundu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the two-channel Kondo effect in the context of two interacting
helical liquids coupled to a spin-$\frac12$ magnetic impurity. We show that
interactions between the two helical liquids significantly affect the phase
diagram and other observable properties. Using a multichannel Luttinger liquid
formalism, we analyze both the Toulouse limit, where an exact solution is
available, and the weak coupling limit, which can be studied via a perturbative
renormalization group (RG) approach. We recover the results for the `decoupled'
limit (interactions between the helical liquids switched off) and point out
deviations from the known results due to this coupling. The perturbative RG
study shows that each of the channels can flow to either a Ferromagnetic (FM)
or an Anti-Ferromagnetic (AFM) fixed point. We obtain the phase diagram of the
coupled system as a function of the system parameters. Observable consequences
of the coupling are captured using linear response theory, which shows the
scaling of the temperature as a function of the inter-channel interaction
parameters.

<h3>Predicted T-XY (X$\neq$Y=P, As and Sb) monolayer with intrinsic  persistent spin helix and large piezoelectric response</h3>

<br>
<br>
The persistent spin helix (PSH) is robust against spin-independent scattering
and renders an extremely long spin lifetime, which can improve the performance
of potential spintronic devices. To achieve the PSH, a unidirectional spin
configuration is required in the momentum space. Here, T-XY (X$\neq$Y=P, As and
Sb) monolayers with dynamical, mechanical and thermal stabilities are predicted
to intrinsically possess PSH. Due to the $C_{2\upsilon}$ point-group symmetry,
a unidirectional spin configuration is preserved in the out-of-plane direction
for both conduction and valence bands around the high-symmetry $\Gamma$ point.
That is, the expectation value of the spin $S$ only has the out-of-plane
component $S_z$. The application of an out-of-plane external electric field can
induce in-plane components $S_x$ and $S_y$, thus offering a promising platform
for the on-off logical functionality of spin devices. T-XY (X$\neq$Y=P, As and
Sb) monolayers are determined to be excellent two-dimensional (2D)
piezoelectric materials. The in-plane piezoelectric coefficient $d_{11}$
(absolute value) of T-SbP is 226.15 pm/V, which is larger than that reported
for most 2D materials, providing possibility of tuning spin-splitting of PSH by
in-plane electric field induced with a uniaxial in-plane strain through
piezoelectric effect. Our work reveals a new family of T-phase 2D materials,
which could provide promising applications in spintronic and piezoelectric
devices.

A host of elastic systems consisting of active components exhibit
path-dependent elastic behaviors not found in classical elasticity, which is
known as odd elasticity. Odd elasticity is characterized by antisymmetric (odd)
elastic modulus tensor. Here, from the perspective of geometry, we construct
the Hamiltonian formalism to show the origin of the antisymmetry of the elastic
moduli. Furthermore, both non-conservative stress and the associated nonlinear
constitutive relation naturally arise. This work also opens the promising
possibility of exploring the physics of odd elasticity in dynamical regime by
Hamiltonian formalism.

The single electron spectrum and wavefunctions in quasicrystals continue to
be a fascinating problem, with few known solutions, especially in two and
higher dimensions. This paper investigates the energy spectra and gap
structures in tight-binding models on a quasiperiodic tiling in two dimensions.
By varying a continuous parameter, we follow the evolution of the band
structure from the discrete molecular or atomic states, to the multifractal
states well-known from previous studies. We propose a scheme for labeling gaps
in finite approximants. It is equivalent in the limit of infinite systems to
the one presented by Kellendonk and Putnam based on the algebraic structure of
this quasiperiodic system.

We investigated the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic Kondo
lattice CePd5Al2 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. The experimentally determined band structure of the conduction
electrons is predominated by the Pd 4d character. It contains multiple hole and
electron Fermi pockets, in good agreement with density functional theory
calculations. The Fermi surface is folded over Q0 = (0, 0, 1), manifested by
Fermi surface reconstruction and band folding. Our results suggest that Fermi
surface nesting drives the formation of antiferromagnetic order in CePd5Al2.

<br>
Motivated by the recent report of room-temperature superconductivity at
near-ambient pressure in N-doped lutetium hydride by Dasenbrock et al. [Nature
615, 244 (2023)], we performed a comprehensive, detailed study of the phase
diagram of the Lu-N-H system, looking for superconducting phases. We combined
ab initio crystal structure prediction with ephemeral data-derived interatomic
potentials to sample over 200,000 different structures. Out of the more than
150 structures predicted to be metastable within $\sim$ 50 meV from the convex
hull we identify 52 viable candidates for conventional superconductivity, for
which we computed their superconducting properties from Density Functional
Perturbation Theory. Although for some of these structures we do predict a
finite superconducting $T_{\text{c}}$, none is even remotely compatible with
room-temperature superconductivity as reported by Dasenbrock et al. Our work
joins the broader community effort that has followed the report of near-ambient
superconductivity, confirming beyond reasonable doubt that no conventional
mechanism can explain the reported $T_{\text{c}}$ in Lu-N-H.

Dissipative phase transitions (DPT) occur when a small quantum system
interacts with a bath of harmonic oscillators. At equilibrium, DPTs are
accompanied by an entropy change, signaling the loss of coherence. Despite
extensive efforts, equilibrium DPTs have yet to be observed. Here, we
demonstrate that ongoing experiments on double quantum dots that measure
entropy using a nearby quantum point contact (QPC) realize the celebrated
spin-boson model and allow to measure the entropy change of its DPT. We find a
Kosterlitz-Thouless flow diagram, leading to a universal jump in the spin-bath
interaction, reflected in a discontinuity in the zero temperature QPC
conductance.

<h3>Magnetostriction in the magneto-sensitive elastomers with  inhomogeneously magnetized particles: pairwise interaction approximation</h3>

<br>
<i>Dmytro Yaremchuk, Dmytro Ivaneyko, Jaroslav Ilnytskyi</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the magnetostriction effect occurring in the magneto-sensitive
elastomers (MSEs) containing inhomogeneously magnetized particles. As it was
shown before, the expression for the interaction potential between two magnetic
spheres, that accounts for their mutual inhomogeneous magnetization, can be
obtained from the Laplace equation. We use this potential in the approximation
formula form to construct magnetic energy of the sample in terms of the
pairwise interactions of the particles. We show that this form of magnetic
energy leads to the same demagnetizing factor as predicted by the continuum
mechanics, confirming that only dipole-dipole magnetic interactions are
important on a large scale. As the next step, we examine the role played by the
particles arrangement on the magnetostriction effect. We consider different
spatial distributions of the magnetic particles: a uniform one, as well as
several lattice-type distributions (SC, BCC, HCP and FCC arrangements). We show
that the particles arrangement affects significantly the magnetostriction
effect if the separation between them became comparable with the particles'
dimensions. We also show that, typically, this contribution to the
magnetostriction effect is of the opposite sign to the one related with the
initial elastomer shape. Finally, we calculate the magnetostriction effect
using the same interaction potential but expressed in a form of a series
expansion, qualitatively confirming the above findings.

<h3>Impurity effect on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces: Analysis based on  iron-based superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Tatsuya Miki, Hiroaki Ikeda, Shintaro Hoshino</i>
<br>
<br>
The effect of impurities on a superconductor with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces
(BFSs) is studied using a realistic tight-binding model. Based on the band
structure composed of $d$-orbitals in tetragonal FeSe, whose S-doped sample is
a potential material for BFS, we construct the superconducting state by
introducing a time-reversal broken pair potential in terms of the band index.
We further consider the effect of impurities on the BFS, where the impurity
potential is defined as a local potential for the original $d$-orbitals. The
self-energy is calculated using the (self-consistent) Born approximation, which
shows an enhancement of the single-particle spectral weight on the Fermi
surface. This is consistent with the previous phenomenological theory and is
justified by the present more detailed calculation based on the FeSe-based
material.

<br>
<i>P. Roura Bas, A. A. Aligia</i>
<br>
<br>
We obtain the quantum phase diagram of the ionic Hubbard model including
electron-hole symmetric density-dependent hopping. The boundaries of the phases
are determined by crossing of excited levels with particular discrete
symmetries, which coincide with jumps of charge and spin Berry phases with a
topological meaning. Reducing the magnitude of the hopping terms that do not
change the total number of singly occupied sites with respect to the other one,
the region of the phase diagram occupied by the fully gapped spontaneously
dimerized insulator (which separates the band insulating and Mott insulating
phases) is enlarged, particularly for small values of the alternating on-site
energy. This result might be relevant for experiments in cold atoms in which
topological charge pumping is observed when alternation in the hopping is
included.

<h3>Electrical tuning of robust layered antiferromagnetism in MXene  monolayer</h3>

<br>
<br>
A-type antiferromagnetism, with an in-plane ferromagnetic order and the
interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, owns inborn advantages for electrical
manipulations but is naturally rare in real materials except in those
artificial antiferromagnetic heterostructures. Here, a robust layered
antiferromagnetism with a high N\'eel temperature is predicted in a MXene
Cr$_2$CCl$_2$ monolayer, which provides an ideal platform as a magnetoelectric
field effect transistor. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate
that an electric field can induce the band splitting between spin-up and
spin-down channels. Although no net magnetization is generated, the inversion
symmetry between the lower Cr layer and the upper Cr layer is broken via
electronic cloud distortions. Moreover, this electric field can be replaced by
a proximate ferroelectric layer for nonvolatility. The magneto-optic Kerr
effect can be used to detect this magnetoelectricity, even if it is a collinear
antiferromagnet with zero magnetization.

<br>
<br>
In this work, the morphology of nematic capillary nanobridges in slit pores
separated by a vertical distance $D$ will be characterised by Monte Carlo
simulations for oblate molecules nematogen modelled by the Gay-Berne potential.
Previous studies on droplets show that the molecules are arranged
homeotropically at the nematic-vapour interface and form spherical droplets
with an annular disclination located in their equatorial plane. In the presence
of pores with attractive substrates that favour homeotropic anchoring, the
formation of nanobridges characterised by anchoring angles that decrease with
increasing particle-substrate interaction intensity is observed. When the
orientational field in the nanobridge is analysed, the formation of an annular
disclination of topological charge $+1/2$ located in the plane perpendicular to
the $z$-axis that passes through the centre of mass of the nanobridge is
observed for small $D$. However, when considering higher values of $D$, a
change to a biaxial orientational profile within the nanobridge is observed,
where now the annular disclination is arranged in a plane perpendicular to one
direction of the $xy$ plane. These results are indicative of the existence of
an orientational phase transition for an intermediate $D$ value between a
uniaxial and a biaxial orientational configuration in the capillary nanobridge.

Suspended in the gas phase, 1D inorganic nanoparticles (nanotubes and
nanowires) grow to hundreds of microns in a second and can be thus directly
assembled into freestanding network materials. The corresponding process
continuously transforms gas precursors into aerosols into aerogels into
macroscopic nanotextiles. By enabling the assembly of very high aspect ratio
nanoparticles, this processing route has translated into high-performance
structural materials, transparent conductors and battery anodes, amongst other
embodiments. This paper reviews progress in the application of such
manufacturing process to nanotubes and nanowires. It analyses 1D nanoparticle
growth through floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FCCVD), in terms
of reaction selectivity, scalability and its inherently ultra-fast growth rates
(107-108 atoms per second) up to 1000 times faster than for substrate CVD. We
summarise emerging descriptions of the formation of aerogels through
percolation theory and multi-scale models for the collision and aggregation of
1D nanoparticles. The paper shows that macroscopic ensembles of 1D
nanoparticles resemble textiles in their porous network structure, high
flexibility and damage-tolerance. Their bulk properties depend strongly on
inter-particle properties and are dominated by alignment and volume fraction.
Selected examples of nanotextiles that surpass granular and monolithic
materials include structural fibres with polymer-like toughness, transparent
conductors, and slurry-free composite electrodes for energy storage.

Recently, Wang et al. [Phys. Rev. B, 106, 195129 (2022)] challenged a widely
held belief in the field of Weyl physics, demonstrating that
single-pair-Weyl-points (SP-WPs) can exist in nonmagnetic spinless systems,
contrary to previous assumptions that they could only exist in magnetic
systems. Wang et al. observed that the SP-WPs with opposite and even chiral
charges (i.e., |C| = 2 or 4) could also exist in nonmagnetic spinless systems.
In this Letter, we present a novel finding in which SP-WPs have a partner,
namely a charged nodal surface, in nonmagnetic spinless systems. In contrast to
previous observations, we show that the SP-WPs can have uneven chiral charges
(i.e., |C| = 1). We identify 6 (out of 230) space groups (SGs) that contain
such SP-WPs by searching the encyclopedia of emergent particles in
three-dimensional crystals. Our finds were confirmed through the phonon spectra
of two specific materials Zr3O (with SG 182) and NaPH2NO3 (with SG 173). This
discovery broadens the range of materials that can host SP-WPs and applies to
other nonmagnetic spinless crystals.

Mimicking the perceptual functions of human cutaneous mechanoreceptors,
artificial skins or flexible pressure sensors can transduce tactile stimuli to
quantitative electrical signals. Conventional methods to design such devices
follow a forward structure-to-property routine based on trial-and-error
experiments/simulations, which take months or longer to determine one solution
valid for one specific material. Target-oriented inverse design that shows far
higher output efficiency has proven effective in other fields, but is still
absent for artificial skins because of the difficulties in acquiring big data.
Here, we report a property-to-structure inverse design of artificial skins
based on small dataset machine learning, exhibiting a comprehensive efficiency
at least four orders of magnitude higher than the conventional routine. The
inverse routine can predict hundreds of solutions that overcome the intrinsic
signal saturation problem for linear response in hours, and the solutions are
valid to a variety of materials. Our results demonstrate that the inverse
design allowed by small dataset is an efficient and powerful tool to target
multifarious applications of artificial skins, which can potentially advance
the fields of intelligent robots, advanced healthcare, and human-machine
interfaces.

We present a systematic study of statistical mechanics for non-Hermitian
quantum systems. Our work reveals that the stability of a non-Hermitian system
necessitates the existence of a single path-dependent conserved quantity,
which, in conjunction with the system's Hamiltonian, dictates the equilibrium
state. By elucidating the relationship between the Hamiltonian and the
supported conserved quantity, we propose criteria for discerning equilibrium
states with finite relaxation times. Although our findings indicate that only
non-Hermitian systems with real energy spectrum precisely possess such
conserved quantities, we also demonstrate that an effective conserved quantity
can manifest in certain systems with complex energy spectra. The effective
conserved quantity, alongside the effective transitions within their associated
subspace, collectively determines the system's equilibrium state. Our results
provide valuable insights into non-Hermitian systems across various contexts
and hold potential for applications in a diverse range of physical systems.

Typically visualized from an independent particle viewpoint, the Pauli
principle's role in collective motion is analyzed leading to a reimagination of
the microscopic dynamics underlying superfluidity/superconductivity and a
reinterpretation of several interrelated phenomena: Cooper pairs, the Fermi
sea, and Pauli blocking. The current approach, symmetry-invariant perturbation
theory is a first principles method with no adjustable parameters. An adiabatic
evolution is employed to transfer the well-known Pauli restrictions for
identical, independent particles with two spin values to restrictions on the
collective modes of an ensemble of ``spin up'' ``spin down'' particles. The
collective modes, analytic N-body normal modes, are obtained from a group
theoretic exact solution of the first-order equations. Cooper pairing is
reinterpreted not as the pairing of two fermions with total zero momentum, but
as the convergence of the momentum of the entire ensemble to two values, +k and
-k, as the particles in the normal mode move back and forth with a single
frequency and phase. The Fermi sea and Pauli blocking, commonly described using
independent fermions that occupy lower states to create a ``sea'' in energy
space and block occupation is redescribed as a collective energy phenomena of
the entire ensemble. Superfluidity, which has always been viewed as a
collective phenomena as Cooper pairs are assumed to condense into a macroscopic
occupation of a single lowest state, is now reimagined without two-body pairing
in real space, but as a macroscopic occupation of a low-energy phonon normal
mode resulting in the convergence of the momentum to two equal and opposite
values. The expected properties of superfluidity including the rigidity of the
wave function, interactions between fermions in different pairs, convergence of
the momentum and the gap in the excitation spectrum are discussed.

Metal halide perovskites are multifunctional semiconductors with tunable
structures and properties. They are highly dynamic crystals with complex
octahedral tilting patterns and strongly anharmonic atomic behaviour. In the
higher temperature, higher symmetry phases of these materials, several complex
structural features have been observed. The local structure can differ greatly
from the average structure and there is evidence that dynamic two-dimensional
structures of correlated octahedral motion form. An understanding of the
underlying complex atomistic dynamics is, however, still lacking. In this work,
the local structure of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI$_3$ is investigated using
a new machine learning force field based on the atomic cluster expansion
framework. Through analysis of the temporal and spatial correlation observed
during large-scale simulations, we reveal that the low frequency motion of
octahedral tilts implies a double-well effective potential landscape, even well
into the cubic phase. Moreover, dynamic local regions of lower symmetry are
present within both higher symmetry phases. These regions are planar and we
report the length and timescales of the motion. Finally, we investigate and
visualise the spatial arrangement of these features and their interactions,
providing a comprehensive picture of local structure in the higher symmetry
phases.

<h3>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces in the  collisionless regime</h3>

Using a quantum Boltzmann equation framework, we analyze the nature of
generic low-energy deformations of a critical surface, which exists at the
non-Fermi liquid fixed point of a system consisting of fermions interacting
with massless bosons. The non-Fermi liquid behaviour arises due to the
itinerant quasiparticles of the Fermi surface interacting strongly with the
massless bosons, which on the other hand undergo Landau damping as result of
the mutual interactions. Focussing on the collisionless regime, where we
neglect the collision integral, we chalk out the possible excitations spanning
the entire spectrum of angular momentum ($\ell$) channels (i.e., including both
small and large values of $\ell$). The excitations are of two types:
particle-hole like localized excitations forming an energy band (or continuum)
and delocalized collective modes with discrete energies. Although we find a
collective mode analogous to the zero sound of a Fermi liquid, its dispersion
shows a crossover from a $\Omega \sim |\mathbf q|^{6/5}$ behaviour to the usual
$ \Omega \sim |\mathbf q|$ dependence, where $\Omega$ and $\mathbf q$ represent
the frequency and momentum, respectively. We estimate the frequency scale at
which this crossover takes place. We also determine the boundary for the
particle-hole continuum in the $\Omega$-$\mathbf q$ plane, and observe a
crossover from $\Omega \sim |\mathbf q|^{3/2}$ to $ \Omega \sim |\mathbf q|$
behaviour, determined by another crossover frequency scale.

We report on the low-frequency electronic noise in
(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ Schottky barrier diodes. The noise spectral density
reveals 1/f dependence, characteristic of the flicker noise, with superimposed
Lorentzian bulges at the intermediate current levels (f is the frequency). The
normalized noise spectral density in such diodes was determined to be on the
order of 10$^{-12}$ cm$^2$/Hz (f=10 Hz) at 1 A/cm$^2$ current density. At the
intermediate current regime, we observed the random telegraph signal noise,
correlated with the appearance of Lorentzian bulges in the noise spectrum. The
random telegraph signal noise was attributed to the defects near the Schottky
barrier. The defects can affect the local electric field and the potential
barrier, and correspondingly, impact the electric current. The obtained results
help to understand noise in Schottky barrier diodes made of ultra-wide-band-gap
semiconductors and can be used for the material and device quality assessment.
