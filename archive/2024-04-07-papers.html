<h3>Singlet, triplet, and mixed all-to-all pairings emerging from incoherent  fermions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03731" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03731</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein</i>
<p>The electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling in complex materials can
be more complicated than simple density-density interactions, involving
intertwined dynamics of spin, charge, and spatial symmetries. This motivates
studying universal models with complex interactions, and studying whether in
this case BCS-type singlet pairing is still the ``natural'' fate of the system.
To this end, we construct a Yukawa-SYK model with nonlocal couplings in both
spin and charge channels. Furthermore, we provide for time-reversal-symmetry
breaking dynamics by averaging over the Gaussian Unitary ensemble rather than
the Orthogonal ensemble. We find that the ground state of the system can be an
orbitally nonlocal superconducting state arising from incoherent fermions with
no BCS-like analog. The superconductivity has an equal tendency to triplet and
singlet pairing states separated by a non-Fermi liquid phase. We further study
the fate of the system within the superconducting phase and find that the
expected ground state, away from the critical point, is a mixed singlet/triplet
state. Finally, we find that while at $T_c$ the triplet and singlet transitions
are dual to one another, below $T_c$ the duality is broken, with the triplet
state more susceptible to orbital fluctuations just by virtue of its symmetry.
Our results indicate that such fluctuation-induced mixed states may be an
inherent feature of strongly correlated materials.

<h3>Dynamical heterogeneity and large deviations in the open quantum East  glass model from tensor networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03750</a>
<br>
</p><i>Luke Causer, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<p>We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model
via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent
evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to
exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical
heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in
classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product
operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that
glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to
the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by
calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear
evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also
show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the
large deviations.

<h3>Nernst effect of high-mobility Weyl electrons in NdAlSi enhanced by a  Fermi surface nesting instability</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03762" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03762</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rinsuke Yamada, Takuya Nomoto, Atsushi Miyake, Toshihiro Terakawa, Akiko Kikkawa, Ryotaro Arita, Masashi Tokunaga, Yasujiro Taguchi, Yoshinori Tokura, Max Hirschberger</i>
<p>The thermoelectric Nernst effect of solids converts heat flow to beneficial
electronic voltages. Here, using a correlated topological semimetal with high
carrier mobility $\mu$ in presence of magnetic fluctuations, we demonstrate an
enhancement of the Nernst effect close to a magnetic phase transition. A
magnetic instability in NdAlSi modifies the carrier relaxation time on
'hotspots' in momentum space, causing a strong band filling dependence of
$\mu$. We quantitatively derive electronic band parameters from a novel
two-band analysis of the Nernst effect $S_{xy}$, in good agreement with quantum
oscillation measurements and band calculations. While the Nernst response of
NdAlSi behaves much like conventional semimetals at high temperatures, an
additional contribution $\Delta S_{xy}$ from electronic correlations appears
just above the magnetic transition. Our work demonstrates the engineering of
the relaxation time, or the momentum-dependent self energy, to generate a large
Nernst response independent of a material's carrier density, i.e. for metals,
semimetals, and semiconductors with large $\mu$.

<h3>Resonance energies and linewidths of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O quantum  wells</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03782" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03782</a>
<br>
</p><i>Niklas Scheuler, Patric Rommel, Jörg Main, Pavel A. Belov</i>
<p>Rydberg excitons are the solid-state analog of Rydberg atoms and can, e.g.,
for cuprous oxide, easily reach a large size in the region of $\mu$m for
principal quantum numbers up to $n=25$. The fabrication of quantum well-like
structures in the crystal leads to quantum confinement effects and opens the
possibility to study a crossover from three-dimensional to two-dimensional
excitons. For small widths of the quantum well (QW) there are several well
separated Rydberg series between various scattering thresholds leading to the
occurrence of electron-hole resonances with finite lifetimes above the lowest
threshold. By application of the stabilization method to the parametric
dependencies of the real-valued eigenvalues of the original three-dimensional
Schr\"{o}dinger equation we calculate the resonance energies and linewidths for
Rydberg excitons in QWs in regimes where a perturbative treatment is
impossible. The positions and finite linewidths of resonances at energies above
the third threshold are compared with the complex resonance energies obtained
within the framework of the complex-coordinate-rotation technique. The
excellent agreement between the results demonstrates the validity of both
methods for intermediate sizes of the QW-like structures, and thus for
arbitrary widths.

<h3>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect  gradients</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</a>
<br>
</p><i>Carlos Floyd, Aaron R. Dinner, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan</i>
<p>Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically
implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based
system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that
"imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that
is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error
signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce
an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and
control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We
present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several
examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external
time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of
contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that
our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative
systems. For systems evolving under non-conservative dynamics, we derive a new
theoretical result that makes possible the control of non-equilibrium
steady-state probabilities through simple local update rules. Finally, we show
that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for
non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of
active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that
pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic
fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in
principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of
decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.

<h3>Spin dynamics and possible topological magnons in non-stoichiometric  pyrochlore iridate Tb$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ studied by RIXS</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03829</a>
<br>
</p><i>Q. Faure, A. Toschi, J. R. Soh, E. Lhotel, B. Detlefs, D. Prabhakaran, D. F. McMorrow, C. J. Sahle</i>
<p>We report a resonant inelastic X-ray scattering study on a single crystal of
a non-stoichiometric pyrochlore iridate Tb$_{2+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$O$_{7-y}$ ($x
\simeq 0.25$) that magnetically orders at $T_{\rm{N}}\simeq 50$ K. We find that
the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the trigonal distortion of the
IrO$_6$ octahedra are comparable with the ones obtained in other pyrochlore
iridates. We observe a propagating gapped magnon mode at low energy, and model
it using a Hamiltonian consisting of a Heisenberg exchange [$J = 16.2(9)$ meV]
and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions [$D = 5.2(3)$ meV], which shows the
robustness of interactions despite Tb-stuffing at the Ir-site. Strikingly, the
ratio $D/J = 0.32(3)$ supports possible non-trivial topological magnon band
crossing. This material may thus host coexisting fermionic and bosonic
topology, with potential for manipulating electronic and magnonic topological
bands thanks to the $d-f$ interaction.

<h3>Light-element and purely charge-based topological materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03832</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nassim Derriche, Marcel Franz, George Sawatzky</i>
<p>We examine a class of Hamiltonians characterized by interatomic, interorbital
even-odd parity hybridization as a model for a family of topological insulators
without the need for spin-orbit coupling. Non-trivial properties of these
materials are exemplified by studying the topologically-protected edge states
of s-p hybridized alkali and alkaline earth atoms in one and two-dimensional
lattices. In 1D the topological features are analogous to the canonical
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but, remarkably, occur in the absence of
dimerization. Alkaline earth chains, with Be standing out due to its gap size
and near particle-hole symmetry, are of particular experimental interest since
their Fermi energy without doping lies directly at the level of topological
edge stats. Similar physics is demonstrated to occur in a 2D honeycomb lattice
system of s-p bonded atoms, where dispersive edge states emerge. Lighter
elements are predicted using this model to host topological states in contrast
to spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversion favoring heaving atoms.

<h3>Spin fluctuations in the ultranodal superconducting state of Fe(Se,S)</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03846</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yifu Cao, Chandan Setty, Andreas Kreisel, Laura Fanfarillo, P.J. Hirschfeld</i>
<p>The iron-based superconductor FeSe isovalently substituted with S displays an
abundance of remarkable phenomena that have not been fully understood, at the
center of which are apparent zero-energy excitations in the superconducting
state in the tetragonal phase. The phenomenology has been generally consistent
with the proposal of the so-called ultranodal states where Bogoliubov Fermi
surfaces are present. Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance measurements have
seen unusually large upturns in the relaxation rate as temperature decreases to
nearly zero in these systems, calling for theoretical investigations. In this
paper, we calculate the spin susceptibility of an ultranodal superconductor
including correlation effects within the random phase approximation. Although
the non-interacting mean-field calculation rarely gives an upturn in the low
temperature relaxation rate within our model, we found that correlation
strongly enhances scattering between hot spots on the Bogoliubov Fermi surface,
resulting in robust upturns when the interaction is strong. Our results suggest
that in addition to the presence of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, correlation and
multiband physics also play important roles in the system's low energy
excitations.

<h3>Intrinsic process for upconversion photoluminescence via $K$-momentum  phonon coupling in carbon nanotubes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03849" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03849</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daichi Kozawa, Shun Fuji, Yuichiro K. Kato</i>
<p>We investigate the intrinsic microscopic mechanism of photon upconversion in
air-suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes through photoluminescence and
upconversion photoluminescence spectroscopy. Nearly linear excitation power
dependence of upconversion photoluminescence intensity is observed, indicating
a one-photon process as the underlying mechanism. In addition, we find a
strongly anisotropic response to the excitation polarization which reflects the
intrinsic nature of the upconversion process. In upconversion photoluminescence
excitation spectra, three peaks are observed which are similar to
photoluminescence sidebands of the $K$-momentum dark singlet exciton. The
features in the upconversion photoluminescence excitation spectra are well
reproduced by our second-order exciton-phonon interaction model, enabling the
determination of phonon energies and relative amplitudes. The analysis reveals
that the upconversion photoluminescence can be described as a reverse process
of the sideband emission linked to the $K$-momentum phonon modes. The validity
of our model is further reinforced by temperature-dependent upconversion
photoluminescence excitation measurements reflecting variations in the phonon
population. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the resonant
exciton-phonon coupling in pristine carbon nanotubes and presents potential for
advanced optothermal technologies by engineering the excitation pathways.

<h3>Establishing the relationship between generalized crystallographic  texture and macroscopic yield surfaces using partial input convex neural  networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03863" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03863</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lloyd van Wees, Karthik Shankar, Jan N. Fuhg, Nikolaos Bouklas, Paul Shade, Mark Obstalecki, Matthew Kasemer</i>
<p>In this study, we present a methodology to predict the macroscopic yield
surface of metals and metallic alloys with general crystallographic textures.
In previous work, we have established the use of partially input convex neural
networks (pICNN) as macroscopic yield functions of crystal plasticity
simulations. However, this work was performed with an over-abundance of data,
and on limited crystallographic textures. Here, we extend this study to
approach more realistic material states (i.e., complex crystallographic
textures), and consider data-availability as a major driver for our approach.
We present our modified framework capable of handling generalized material
states and demonstrate its effectiveness on materials with complex textures. We
further describe an adaptive algorithm for the generation of training data as
informed by the shape of yield surfaces to reduce the time for both the
generation of training data as well as pICNN training. Finally, we will discuss
errors in both training and test datasets, limitations, and future
extensibility.

<h3>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03889</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yan Li, Keyi Liu, Garnett W. Bryant</i>
<p>Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant
ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically
for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite onsite Coulomb repulsion and
a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials, and
was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a 2 \times 2
array of gated quantum dots. Atomically precise fabrication of dopant arrays in
Si allows for engineering highly controllable systems with complex geometries.
This makes dopant arrays a good candidate to study NF in different array
geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical
simulations done for $3 \times 3$ arrays and larger $N \times N $ arrays of
quantum dots, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in
different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3 \times 3$ arrays, as well as in
$N \times N $ arrays for one hole less than half-filling. The ratio of the
Hubbard on-site repulsion U to hopping t that defines the onset of NF increases
as N increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite U for large N.
Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N
\times N $ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different
geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops,
the critical U/t for the onset of ferromagnetism decreases as the loop length
increases. We show that this different dependence on size for loops and $N
\times N $ arrays can be understood by a scaling argument. Our results show how
analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects
including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk
and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining the quantum magnetism of
small systems.

<h3>Direct Electrical Detection of Spin Chemical Potential Due to Spin Hall  Effect in $β$-Tungsten and Platinum Using a Pair of Ferromagnetic and  Normal Metal Voltage probes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03934" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03934</a>
<br>
</p><i>Soumik Aon, Abu Bakkar Miah, Arpita Mandal, Harekrishna Bhunia, Dhananjaya Mahapatra, Partha Mitra</i>
<p>The phenomenon of Spin Hall Effect (SHE) generates a pure spin current
transverse to an applied current in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling,
although not detectable through conventional electrical measurement. An
intuitive Hall effect like measurement configuration is implemented to directly
measure pure spin chemical potential of the accumulated spins at the edges of
heavy metal (HM) channels that generates large SHE. A pair of transverse
linearly aligned voltage probes in placed in ohmic contact with the top surface
of HM , one being a ferromagnetic metal (FM) with non-zero spin polarization
and other is the reference metal (RM) with zero polarization of carriers. This
combination of FM/RM electrodes is shown to induce an additional voltage
proportional to a spin accumulation potential, which is anti symmetric with
respect to opposite orientations of FM controlled by a 2D vector magnet. Proof
of concept of the measurement scheme is verified by comparing the signs of
voltages for HM channels of Tungsten (W) and Platinum (Pt) which are known to
generate opposite spin accumulation under similar conditions of applied
current. The same devices are also able to detect the reciprocal effect,
inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) by swapping the current and voltage leads and
the results are consistent with reciprocity principle. Further, exploiting a
characteristic feature of W thin film deposition, a series of devices were
fabricated with W resistivity varying over a wide range of 10 - 750 $\mu
\Omega$-cm and the calculated spin Hall resistivity exhibits a pronounced power
law dependence on resistivity. Our measurement scheme combined with almost two
decades of HM resistivity variation provides the ideal platform required to
test the underlying microscopic mechanism responsible for SHE/ISHE.

<h3>Topological moiré polaritons</h3>

<br>
</p><i>I. Septembre, C. Leblanc, D. D. Solnyshkov, G. Malpuech</i>
<p>The combination of an in-plane honeycomb potential and of a photonic
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emulates a photonic/polaritonic analog of bilayer
graphene. We show that modulating the SOC magnitude allows to change the
overall lattice periodicity, emulating any type of moir\'e-arranged bilayer
graphene with a unique all-optical access to the moir\'e band topology. We show
that breaking the time-reversal symmetry by an effective exciton-polariton
Zeeman splitting opens a large topological gap in the array of moir\'e flat
bands. This gap contains one-way topological edge states whose constant group
velocity makes an increasingly sharp contrast with the flattening moir\'e
bands.

<h3>On the critical competition between singlet exciton decay and free  charge generation in non-fullerene-based organic solar cells with low  energetic offsets</h3>

<p>In this era of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells,
reducing voltage losses while maintaining high photocurrents is the holy grail
of current research. Recent focus lies in understanding the manifold
fundamental mechanisms in organic blends with minimal energy offsets -
particularly the relationship between ionization energy offset ({\Delta}IE) and
free charge generation. We quantitatively probe this relationship in multiple
NFA-based blends by mixing Y5 and Y6 NFAs with PM6 of varying molecular
weights, covering a 15% to 1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) range and a
progression of {\Delta}IE. Spectroelectrochemistry reveals a critical
{\Delta}IE of approximately 0.3 eV, below which the PCE sharply declines.
Transient absorption spectroscopy consistently reveals that a smaller
{\Delta}IE slows the dissociation of the NFA's local singlet exciton (LE) into
free charges, albeit restorable by an electric field. Bias-dependent time
delayed collection experiments quantify the free charge generation efficiency,
while photoluminescence quantum efficiency measurements assess photocurrent
loss from LE decay. Combined with transient photoluminescence experiments, we
find that the decay of singlet excitons is the primary competition to free
charge generation in low-offset NFA-based organic solar cells, with neither
noticeable losses from charge-transfer (CT) decay nor evidence for LE-CT
hybridization. Our experimental data align with Marcus theory calculations,
supported by density functional theory simulations, for zero-field free charge
generation and exciton decay efficiencies. We find that efficient photocurrent
generation generally requires that the CT state is located below the LE, but
that this restriction is lifted in systems with a small reorganization energy
for charge transfer.

<h3>Bragg diffraction of higher orders on oblique helicoidal liquid crystal  structures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03967" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03967</a>
<br>
</p><i>H. Bogatyryova, V. Chornous, L. Lisetski, I. Gvozdovskyy</i>
<p>For the oblique helicoidal structure of the chiral twist-bend nematic-forming
mixture of CB7CB/CB6OCB/5CB doped by light-sensitive chiral compound based on
azo-fragment, two consequent states of Bragg reflection of the light in the
visible spectral range from 400 to 750 nm were experimentally observed in the
course of decreasing the applied electric field. These states were assigned to
different orders of Bragg's diffraction. While the second and third orders of
Bragg's diffraction can be easily observed in conditions of standard
electrooptic cell, the first order could be revealed only at very high electric
field near the "red" edge of the visible spectral range. For the second and
third orders of diffraction there is a narrow range of electric field where
both diffraction orders are observed (so-called hybrid state), with
transmittance spectra of the $Ch_{OH}$ structure showing two peaks at the
short-wavelength and the long-wavelength edges of the visible spectral range.
Model calculations of Bragg's reflection of light were carried out using
literature values of elasticity constants and dielectric permittivity, and the
calculated plots of the selective reflection maximum vs. voltage were in good
agreement with experimental data.

<h3>On the Antiferromagnetic$\unicode{x2013}$Ferromagnetic Phase Transition  in Pinwheel Artificial Spin Ice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03973</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anders Strømberg, Einar Digernes, Rajesh Vilas Chopdekar, Jostein Grepstad, Erik Folven</i>
<p>Nanopatterned magnetic thin films offer a platform for exploration of
tailored magnetic properties such as emergent long-range order. A prominent
example is artificial spin ice (ASI), where an arrangement of nanoscale
magnetic elements, acting as macrospins, interact via their dipolar fields. In
this study, we discuss the transition from antiferromagnetic (AF) to
ferromagnetic (FM) long-range order in a square lattice ASI, as the magnetic
elements are gradually rotated through 45{\deg} to a "pinwheel" configuration.
The AF$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition is observed experimentally using
synchrotron radiation x-ray spectromicroscopy and occurs for a critical
rotation angle of the nanomagnets, contingent upon the dipolar coupling
determined by their separation in the lattice. Large-scale magnetic dipole
simulations show that the point-dipole approximation fails to capture the
correct AF$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition angle. However, excellent agreement
with experimental data is obtained using a dumbbell-dipole model which better
reflects the actual dipolar fields of the magnets. This model explains the
coupling-dependence of the transition angle, another feature not captured by
the pointdipole model. Our findings resolve a discrepancy between measurement
and theory in previous work on "pinwheel" ASIs. Control of the
AF$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition and this revised model open for improved
design of magnetic order in nanostructured systems.

<h3>Phenomenology of a Rydberg impurity in an ideal Bose Einstein condensate</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Aileen A. T. Durst, Matthew T. Eiles</i>
<p>We investigate the absorption spectrum of a Rydberg impurity immersed in and
interacting with an ideal Bose-Einstein condensate. Here, the impurity-bath
interaction can greatly exceed the mean interparticle distance; this
discrepancy in length scales challenges the assumptions underlying the
universal aspects of impurity atoms in dilute bosonic environments. Our
analysis finds three distinct parameter regimes, each characterized by a unique
spectral response. In the low-density regime, we find that the Rydberg impurity
is dressed by the surrounding bath similarly to the known Bose polaron.
Transitioning to intermediate densities, the impurity response, given by sharp
quasiparticle peaks, fragments into an intricate pattern bearing the hallmarks
of a diverse molecular structure. Finally, at high density, a universal
Gaussian response emerges as the statistical nature of the bath dominates its
quantum dynamics. We complement this analysis with a study of an ionic
impurity, which behaves equivalently. Our exploration offers insights into the
interplay between interaction range, density, and many-body behavior in
impurity systems.

<h3>Algebraic localization-delocalization phase transition in moving  potential wells on a lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03993" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03993</a>
<br>
</p><i>Stefano Longhi</i>
<p>The localization and scattering properties of potential wells or barriers
uniformly moving on a lattice are strongly dependent on the drift velocity
owing to violation of the Galilean invariance of the discrete Schr\"odinger
equation. Here a type of localization-delocalization phase transition of
algebraic type is unravelled, which does not require any kind of disorder and
arises when a power-law potential well drifts fast on a lattice. While for an
algebraic exponent $\alpha$ lower than the critical value $\alpha_c=1$
dynamical delocalization is observed, for $\alpha> \alpha_c$ asymptotic
localization, corresponding to an asymptotic frozen dynamics, is instead
realized. At the critical phase transition point $\alpha_=\alpha_c=1$ an
oscillatory dynamics is found, corresponding to Bloch oscillations. An
experimentally-accessible photonic platform for the observation of the
predicted algebraic phase transition, based on light dynamics in synthetic mesh
lattices, is suggested.

<h3>Current-density-modulated Antiferromagnetic Domain Switching Revealed by  Optical Imaging in Pt/CoO(001) Bilayer</h3>

</p><i>Tong Wu, Haoran Chen, Tianping Ma, Jia Xu, Yizheng Wu</i>
<p>Efficient control of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain switching in thin films
is vital for advancing antiferromagnet-based memory devices. In this study, we
directly observed the current-driven switching process of CoO AFM domains in
the Pt/CoO(001) bilayer by the magneto-optical birefringence effect. The
observed critical current density for AFM domain switching remains nearly
constant across varying CoO thicknesses, associated with the consistent
switching polarity n $\perp$ j, suggesting the dominance of the
thermomagnetoelastic effect, where and stand for Neel vector and current
density vector, respectively. Further confirmation comes from a similar
switching process with n $\perp$ j observed in the Pt/Al2O3/CoO sample,
excluding the contribution of spin current injection. Remarkably, it was also
surprisingly observed that the Neel vector can be further switched parallel to
the current direction (n//j) at higher current density. Our findings not only
enhance the understanding of current-driven AFM domain switching but also
present new avenues for manipulating AFM domains.

</p><i>Andrew Jreissaty, Juan Carrasquilla</i>
<p>We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the
so-called $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state
approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the
$\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in
mean-field theory in different regimes of the R\'enyi index $\alpha$. Next, we
re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions,
presenting an exact analysis of the former and devising an unconventional Monte
Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while
mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value
of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo
results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We
conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi free
energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN
performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations.
Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with
the use of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic
equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.

<h3>Phase Binarization in Mutually Synchronized Bias Field-free Spin Hall  Nano-oscillators for Reservoir Computing</h3>

</p><i>Sourabh Manna, Rohit Medwal, John Rex Mohan, Yasuhiro Fukuma, Rajdeep Singh Rawat</i>
<p>Mutually coupled spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) can exhibit binarized
phase state, offering pathways to realize Ising machines and efficient
neuromorphic hardware. Conventionally, phase binarization is achieved in
coupled SHNOs via injecting an external microwave at twice of the oscillator
frequency in presence of a biasing magnetic field. However, this technology
poses potential challenges of higher energy consumption and complex circuit
design. Moreover, fabrication-induced mismatch in SHNO dimensions may hinder
mutual synchronization. Addressing these challenges, we demonstrate purely DC
current-driven mutual synchronization and phase binarization of two
non-identical nanoconstriction SHNOs without biasing magnetic field and
microwave injection. We thoroughly investigate these phenomena and underlying
mechanisms using micromagnetic simulation. We further demonstrate the bias
field-free synchronized SHNO pair efficiently performing a reservoir computing
benchmark learning task: sin and square wave classification, utilizing current
tunable phase binarization. Our results showcase promising magnetization
dynamics of coupled bias field-free SHNOs for future computing applications.

<h3>Numerical study of neutral and charged microgel suspensions: from  single-particle to collective behavior</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04032</a>
<br>
</p><i>Giovanni Del Monte, Emanuela Zaccarelli</i>
<p>We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of
realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing
fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider
charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed
analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different
regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation
and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental
observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective
behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that
has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial
distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing
$\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement,
always slows down. Key similarities and differences between neutral and charged
microgels are identified. Importantly, at high enough $\zeta$ we also detect
the fusion of the shells of charged microgels, that was previously invoked to
explain key experimental findings. This highlights the fact that even for
standard poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, commonly considered as a
prototype of soft colloid, charge effects are relevant. Overall, our study
establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions
under several different conditions. Indeed, it can be readily extended to
tackle different regimes, e.g. high temperature, and systems, e.g. complex
microgel topologies such as ultra-low-crosslinked ones, where experimental
evidence is still limited.

</p><i>Md Aquib Molla, Sanchari Goswami</i>
<p>We study the signal percolation through heart-like biological system.
Starting from an initial distribution of Waiting and Inactive cells with
probabilities $p$ and $(1-p)$ respectively the signal propagation is observed
in terms of Active cells. As the signal enters the system from one end, the
number of arrival of Active sites at the other end is studied and analysis of
the system behaviour is made by varying a few important parameters of the
system like $p_{switch}$ (switching probability from Inactive to Waiting) and
$p_{act}$ (switching probability from Waiting to active). In this connection,
the non-regular heart rhythms are discussed. Fraction of percolating paths
through the system is studied and showed a transition from $0$ to $1$ near
$p=p_c$. Some other important quantities like tortuosity and cluster
distribution are discussed and corresponding exponents have been found.

<p>The concept of scattering length density tuning for improved polarization is
investigated for Fe/11B4CTi multilayers and compared to the commonly used Fe/Si
system in polarizing multilayer neutron optics. X-ray and neutron reflectivity,
magnetization, and neutron polarization have been measured on such multilayers,
highlighting differences from conventional Fe/Si multilayers. The multilayer
systems were deposited with 25 {\AA} period thickness, a layer thickness ratio
of 0.35 and 20 periods, using ion-assisted DC magnetron sputtering. Replacing
Si with 11B4CTi for these multilayers showed an increase in reflectivity due to
a reduction in interface width. By tuning the ratio between 11B4C and Ti in the
non-magnetic layers, a broad range of scattering length density values was
achieved, facilitating scattering length density contrast matching between
layers for spin-down neutrons, thereby enhancing polarization. These findings
demonstrate the potential of Fe/11B4CTi multilayers as a promising option for
polarizing neutron optics and highlight the concept of scattering length
density tuning in a large range using 11B4CTi.

<h3>Resonant Raman signatures of exciton polarons in a transition metal  oxide: BiVO$_4$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04112</a>
<br>
</p><i>Georgy Gordeev, Christina Hill, Angelina Gudima, Stephanie Reich, Mael Guennou</i>
<p>In this work we investigate the delocalized excitons and excitons trapped by
a polaron formation in \BVO{} by means of resonant Raman spectroscopy. We
record Raman spectra with 16 laser lines between 1.9 and \SI{2.6}{\eV} and
analyze intensity variations of the Raman peaks for different vibrational
modes. The resonant Raman cross sections of the \Ag{} modes contain two types
of resonances. The first high-energy resonance near \SI{2.45}{\eV} belongs to a
transition between delocalized states; it is close to absorption edge measured
at \SI{2.3}{\eV} and exhibits a characteristic \SI{50}{\meV} anisotropy between
polarization parallel and perpendicular to the $c$ axis. The high energy Raman
resonance occurs inside the gap at \SI{1.94}{\eV} for all crystallographic
directions.
The in-gap resonance can involve a localized transition. We attribute it to
an exciton-polaron, formed by a small localized electron polaron of Holstein
type and delocalized holes. It manifests in the vibrations of vanadium and
oxygen atoms where polaron localization occurs and the resonance energy matches
theoretical predictions. The vibrational modes couple to the polaron with
different efficiency determined from resonant Raman profiles.

<h3>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons  in aged WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</h3>

<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling
in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external
magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K
and $-$K valleys. Thus, this analogous valley Zeeman effect opens the
possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley of charge
carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials
promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However,
the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayer samples present a moderate valley
Zeeman splitting, which is measured by their g-factor values that are
approximately $-4$. Therefore, for application purposes it is mandatory
alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses. Here we
investigate the valley Zeeman effect in aged WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ grown
monolayers by magneto-photoluminescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures.
These samples present a lower energy defect-bound exciton emission related to
defects adsorbed during the aging process. While the free excitons of these
samples exhibit g-factors between $-3$ and $-4$, their defect-bound excitons
present giant effective g-factor values of $-(25.0 \pm 0.2)$ and $-(19.1 \pm
0.2)$ for WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ aged monolayers, respectively. In addition, we
observe a significant spin polarization of charge carriers in the defective mid
gap states induced by the external magnetic fields. We explain this spin
polarized population in terms of a spin-flip transition mechanism, which is
also responsible for the magnetic dependent light emission of the defect-bound
exciton states. Our work sheds light in the potential of aged TMDs as
candidates for spintronic based devices.

</p><i>Rubén Hurtado-Gutiérrez</i>
<p>In this PhD thesis, I investigate the properties of symmetry-breaking
dynamical phase transitions that manifest in the fluctuations of
time-integrated observables within classical systems. In particular, I analyze
how these phase transitions impose stringent constraints on the structure of
the eigenvectors of the system dynamical generator of the dynamics.
Additionally, I identify a dynamical phase transition to a time-crystal phase
in a model of driven-diffusive lattice gas. The study of this transition then
allows the identification of the "packing-field" mechanism responsible for its
emergence. This mechanism is then exploited to propose new transport models
displaying time-crystal behavior.

<h3>Theory of ultrathin ferroelectrics: the case of CsGeBr$_3$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04144</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ravi Kashikar, Arlies Valdespino, Charlton Ogg, Edvin Uppgard, S. Lisenkov, I. Ponomareva</i>
<p>Ferroelectricity has recently been demonstrated in germanium-based inorganic
halide perovskites. We use atomistic first-principles-based simulations to
study ultra-thin CsGeBr$_3$ films with thicknesses of 4-18 nm and develop a
theory for ferroelectric ultrathin films. The theory introduces (i) a local
order parameter, the local polarization, which allows the identification of
phase transitions into both monodomain and polydomain phases, and (ii) a dipole
pattern classifier, which allows efficient and reliable identification of
unique dipole patterns. Application of the theory to both halides CsGeBr$_3$
and CsGeI$_3$, as well as oxide BiFeO$_3$ ultrathin ferroelectrics, which
undergo paraelectric cubic to ferroelectric rhombohedral phase transition in
bulk, reveal two distinct scenarios for ultrathin films. In the first one, the
films transition into a monodomain phase, which is allowed below a critical
value of the residual depolarizing field. Above this critical value, the second
scenario occurs, and the film undergoes a phase transition into a nanodomain
phase. The two scenarios are associated with the opposite response of Curie
temperature to thickness reduction. As the film's thickness decreases, the
transition temperature into the monodomain phase increases while the transition
temperature into the nanodomain phase decreases. The surface effects are
responsible for the Curie temperature enhancement, while the stripe domain
pattern is the origin of the transition temperature suppression. Application of
dipole pattern classifier reveals a rich variety of nanodomain phases in halide
films: nano-stripes, labyrinths, zig-zags, pillars, and lego-domains. Our work
could lead to both a deeper understanding of nanoscale ferroelectrics and
discoveries of unusual nanoscale dipole patterns.

<h3>Braiding of Majorana bound states in a driven-dissipative Majorana box  setup</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kunmin Wu, Sadeq S. Kadijani, Thomas L. Schmidt</i>
<p>We investigate a system of Majorana box qubits, where each of the Coulomb
blockaded boxes is driven by an applied AC voltage and is embedded in a
dissipative environment. The AC voltage is applied between a pair of quantum
dots, each of which is coupled by tunneling to a Majorana box qubit. Moreover,
the dissipation is created by the coupling to an electromagnetic environment.
Recent work has shown that in this case the Majorana bound states which form
the computational basis can emerge as dark states, which are stabilized by the
dissipation. In our work, we show that the same platform can be used to enable
topological braiding of these dissipative Majorana bound states. We show that
coupling three such Majorana boxes allows a braiding transformation by changing
the tunnel amplitudes adiabatically in time.

<h3>The polarisation fluctuation length scale shaping the superconducting  dome of SrTiO$_3$</h3>

<p>Superconducting domes, ubiquitous across a variety of quantum materials, are
often understood as a window favorite for pairing opened by the fluctuations of
competing orders. Yet, a quantitative understanding of how such a window closes
is missing. Here, we show that inelastic neutron scattering, by quantifying a
length scale associated with polar fluctuations, $\ell_0$, addresses this
issue. We find that the superconducting dome of strontium titanate definitely
ends when $\ell_0$ vanishes. Moreover, the product of $\ell_0$ and the Fermi
wavevector peaks close to the maximum critical temperature. Thus, this
superconducting dome stems from the competition between the increase of the
density of states and the unavoidable collapse of the quantum paraelectric
phase, both induced by doping. The successful quantitative account of both the
peak and the end of the superconducting dome implies a central role in the
pairing mechanism played by the soft ferro-electric mode and its hybridisation
with the acoustic branch. Such a scenario may also be at work in other quantum
paraelectric materials, either bulk or interfaces.

<h3>The structural stability of tungsten nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Laurent Pizzagalli, Sandrine Brochard, Julien Godet, Julien Durinck</i>
<p>Motivated by contradicting reports in the literature, we have investigated
the structural stability of tungsten nanoparticles using density functional
theory calculations. The comparison of BCC, FCC, A15, disordered, and
icosahedral configurations unequivocally shows that BCC is the energetically
most stable structure when the number of atoms is greater than 40. A disordered
structure is more stable for smaller sizes. This result conflicts with an
earlier theoretical study on transition metal nanoparticles, based on a
semi-empirical modeling of nanoparticles energetics [D. Tom{\'a}nek et al.,
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{28}, 665 (1983)]. Examining this latter work in the light
of our results suggests that an erroneous description of clusters geometry is
the source of the discrepancy. Finally, we improve the accuracy of the
semi-empirical model proposed in this work, which will be useful to calculate
nanoparticle energies for larger sizes.

<p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are bioderived nanoparticles that can be
isolated from any source of natural cellulose via sulfuric acid hydrolysis.
Arising from a combination of the negatively-charged sulfate half-ester groups
grafted during this process and their elongated morphology, CNCs typically form
colloidal cholesteric liquid crystalline phases in aqueous suspension.
Recently, the chiral strength of such a CNC mesophase was correlated to the
presence of CNCs with a 'bundle' morphology, analogous to the case of chiral
dopants in molecular liquid crystal systems. This indicates the central role
these composite particles play in the chiral behavior of CNCs, however the
origin and formation pathway of the CNC bundles remains elusive. In this study,
we systematically explore how different post-hydrolysis treatments alter the
morphology of the CNCs (using electron microscopy, viscosimetry, and electron
diffraction) and correlate this to changes in the observed liquid crystalline
behavior. We found that the centrifugation step applied during CNC purification
favors the formation of bundles of aligned crystallites, attached
preferentially on their hydrophobic faces. This is in stark contrast to ionic
treatments, where uncontrolled aggregation dominates. This reveals the
importance of these often-disregarded purification steps on the final chiral
and liquid crystalline properties of CNCs and promotes routes to tailor them
towards a variety of applications.

<h3>Competing topological phases in a non-Hermitian time-reversal  symmetry-broken Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Dipendu Halder, Srijata Lahiri, Saurabh Basu</i>
<p>The Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, which serves as a cornerstone in the
study of the quantum spin Hall insulators, showcases robust spin-filtered
helical edge states in a nanoribbon geometry. In the presence of an in-plane
magnetic field, these (first-order) helical states gap out to be replaced by
second-order corner states under suitable open-boundary conditions. Here, we
show that the inclusion of a spin-dependent non-Hermitian balanced gain/loss
potential induces a competition between these first and second-order
topological phases. Surprisingly, the previously dormant first-order helical
edge states in the nanoribbon resurface as the non-Hermitian effect
intensifies, effectively neutralizing the role played by the magnetic field. By
employing the projected spin spectra and the spin Chern number, we conclusively
explain the resurgence of the first-order topological properties in the
time-reversal symmetry-broken BHZ model in presence of non-Hermiticity.
Finally, the biorthogonal spin-resolved Berry phase, exhibiting a non-trivial
winding, definitively establishes the topological nature of these revived edge
states, emphasizing the dominance of non-Hermiticity over the magnetic field.

<p>In feedback-controlled systems, an external agent -- the feedback controller
-- measures the state of the system and modifies its subsequent dynamics
depending on the outcome of the measurement. In this paper, we build a
Markovian description for the joint stochastic process that comprises both the
system and the controller variables. This Markovian description is valid for a
wide class of feedback-controlled systems, allowing for the inclusion of errors
in the measurement. The general framework is motivated and illustrated with the

<h3>Emergent photons and fractionalized excitations in a quantum spin liquid</h3>

<p>A quantum spin liquid (QSL) arises from a highly entangled superposition of
many degenerate classical ground states in a frustrated magnet, and is
characterized by emergent gauge fields and deconfined fractionalized
excitations (spinons). Because such a novel phase of matter is relevant to
high-transition-temperature superconductivity and quantum computation, the
microscopic understanding of QSL states is a long-sought goal in condensed
matter physics. The 3D pyrochlore lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra can host
a QSL with U(1) gauge fields called quantum spin ice (QSI), which is a quantum
(with effective $S=1/2$) analog of the classical (with large effective moment)
spin ice. A key difference between QSI and classical spin ice is the predicted
presence of the linearly dispersing collective excitations near zero energy,
dubbed the "photons", arising from emergent quantum electrodynamics, in
addition to the spinons at higher energies. Recently, 3D pyrochlore systems
Ce2M2O7 (M = Sn, Zr, Hf) have been suggested as effective $S=1/2$ QSI
candidates, but there has been no evidence of quasielastic magnetic scattering
signals from photons, a key signature for a QSI. Here, we use polarized neutron
scattering experiments on single crystals of Ce2Zr2O7 to conclusively
demonstrate the presence of magnetic excitations near zero energy at 50 mK in
addition to signatures of spinons at higher energies. By comparing the energy
(E), wave vector (Q), and polarization dependence of the magnetic excitations
with theoretical calculations, we conclude that Ce2Zr2O7 is the first example
of a dipolar-octupolar $\pi$ flux QSI with dominant dipolar Ising interactions,
therefore identifying a microscopic Hamiltonian responsible for a QSL.

</p><i>Denis Gessert, Henrik Christiansen, Wolfhard Janke</i>
<p>Aging in phase-ordering kinetics of the $d=3$ Ising model following a quench
from infinite to zero temperature is studied by means of Monte Carlo
simulations. In this model the two-time spin-spin autocorrelator $C_\text{ag}$
is expected to obey dynamical scaling and to follow asymptotically a power-law
decay with the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Previous work indicated that
the lower Fisher-Huse bound of $\lambda\geq d/2 = 1.5$ is violated in this
model. Using much larger systems than previously studied, the instantaneous
exponent for $\lambda$ we obtain at late times does \emph{not} disagree with
this bound. By conducting systematic fits to the data of $C_\text{ag}$ using
different ansaetze for the leading correction term, we find $\lambda =
1.58(14)$ with most of error attributed to the systematic uncertainty regarding
the ansaetze. This result is in contrast to the recent report that below the
roughening transition universality might be violated.

<h3>Direct evidence of low work function on SrVO$_3$ cathode using  thermionic electron emission microscopy and high-field ultraviolet  photoemission spectroscopy</h3>

<p>Perovskite SrVO$_3$ has recently been proposed as a novel electron emission
cathode material. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest multiple
low work function surfaces and recent experimental efforts have consistently
demonstrated effective work functions of ~2.7 eV for polycrystalline samples,
both results suggesting, but not directly confirming, some fraction of even
lower work function surface is present. In this work, thermionic electron
emission microscopy (ThEEM) and high-field ultraviolet photoemission
spectroscopy are used to study the local work function distribution and measure
the work function of a partially-oriented-(110)-SrVO$_3$ perovskite oxide
cathode surface. Our results show direct evidence of low work function patches
of about 2.1 eV on the cathode surface, with corresponding onset of observable
thermionic emission at 750 $^o$C. We hypothesize that, in our ThEEM
experiments, the high applied electric field suppresses the patch field effect,
enabling the direct measurement of local work functions. This measured work
function of 2.1 eV is comparable to the previous DFT-calculated work function
value of the SrVO-terminated (110) SrVO$_3$ surface (2.3 eV) and SrO terminated
(100) surface (1.9 eV). The measured 2.1 eV value is also much lower than the
work function for the (001) LaB$_6$ single crystal cathode (~2.7 eV) and
comparable to the effective work function of B-type dispenser cathodes (~2.1
eV). If SrVO$_3$ thermionic emitters can be engineered to access domains of
this low 2.1 eV work function, they have potential to significantly improve
thermionic emitter-based technologies.

<p>From the pragmatic to the symbolic, textiles play a prominent role in some of
the most demanding yet ubiquitous scenarios, such as covering the complex and
dynamic geometries of the human body. Textiles are made by repeated
manipulations of slender fibers into structures with emergent properties.
Today, these ancient metamaterials are being examined in a new light, propelled
by the idea that their geometric structures can be leveraged to engineer
functional soft materials. However, per their inherent softness, textiles and
other compliant materials cannot typically withstand compressive forces.
This limitation hinders the transfer of soft matter's rich shape-morphing
capabilities to broader research areas that require load-bearing capabilities.
Here we introduce \textit{beading} as a versatile platform that links centuries
of human ingenuity encoded in the world of textiles with the current demand for
smart, programmable materials. By incorporating discrete rigid units, i.e.
\textit{beads}, into various fiber-based assemblies, beadwork adds tunable
stiffness to otherwise flaccid fabrics, creating new opportunities for textiles
to become load-bearing. We select a shell-like bead design as a model
experimental system and thoroughly describe how its mechanics are captured by
friction, the material properties of the constituent elements, and geometry.
The fundamental characterization in this study demonstrates the range of
complex behaviors possible with this class of material, inspiring the
application of soft matter principles to fields that ultimately demand
rigidity, such as robotics and architecture.

<p>Grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly influence the properties and performance of
materials, emphasizing the importance of understanding the GB structure and
phase behavior. As recent computational studies have demonstrated the existence
of multiple GB phases associated with varying the atomic density at the
interface, we introduce a validated, open-source GRand canonical Interface
Predictor (GRIP) tool that automates high-throughput, grand canonical
optimization of GB structures. While previous studies of GB phases have almost
exclusively focused on cubic systems, we demonstrate the utility of GRIP in an
application to hexagonal close-packed titanium. We perform a systematic
high-throughput exploration of tilt GBs in titanium and discover previously
unreported structures and phase transitions. In low-angle boundaries, we
demonstrate a coupling between point defect absorption and the change in the GB
dislocation network topology due to GB phase transformations, which has
important implications for the accommodation of radiation-induced defects.

<p>In few-qubit systems, the quantum Zeno effect arises when measurement occurs
sufficiently frequently that the spins are unable to relax between
measurements. This can compete with Hamiltonian terms, resulting in interesting
relaxation processes which depend non-monotonically on the ratio of measurement
rate to coherent oscillations. While Zeno physics for a single qubit is
well-understood, an interesting open question is how the Zeno effect is
modified by coupling the measured spin to a non-trivial bulk. In this work, we
study the effect of coupling a one-dimensional transverse field Ising to a Zeno
spin which lives at the boundary. We find that sharp singularities occur in the
boundary relaxation dynamics, which can be tied to the emergence or destruction
of edge modes that can be found analytically. Finally, we provide numerical
evidence that the dynamical singularities are stable in the presence of
integrability-breaking interactions.

<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have redefined lighting with their
environment-friendliness and flexibility. However, only 25 % of the electronic
states of fluorescent molecules can emit light upon electrical excitation,
limiting the overall efficiency of OLEDs. Strong light-matter coupling,
achieved by confining light within OLEDs using mirrors, generates polaritons -
hybrid light-matter states - that could activate the remaining 75 % electronic
states. Here, we show how different processes in such polariton OLEDs can be
expected to change using a phenomenological quantum master equation model. We
are especially interested in reverse inter-system crossing happening directly
from the dark triplet states to the emitting lower polariton. We derive a
simple expression for the enhancement factor of polaritonic RISC in the linear
regime. In addition, we explore the extension of our model to higher dimensions
and study some potential effects of strong coupling on nonlinear processes such
as triplet-triplet annihilation.
