<h3>Telluride nanocrystals with adjustable amorphous shell thickness and  core-shell structure modulation by aqueous cation-exchange</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04772</a>

Engineering the structure of core-shell colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles
(CSNPs) is attractive due to the potential to enhance photo-induced charge
transfer (PICT) and induce favourable optical and electronic properties.
Nonetheless, the sensitivity of telluride CSNPs to high temperatures makes it
challenging to precisely modulate their surface crystallinity. Herein, we have
developed an efficient strategy for synthesising telluride CSNPs with thin
amorphous shells using aqueous cation exchange (ACE). By changing the synthesis
temperature in the range 40 to 110C, the crystallinity of the CdTe
nanoparticles was controllable from perfect crystals with no detectable
amorphous shell (c-CdTe) to a core-shell structure with a crystalline CdTe NP
core covered by an amorphous shell of tunable thickness up to 7-8nm (c@a-CdTe)
. A second ACE step transformed the c@a-CdTe to crystalline CdTe@HgTe
core-shell NPs. The c@a-CdTe nanoparticles synthesized at 60C and having a 4-5
nm thick amorphous shell, exhibited the highest surface-enhanced Raman
scattering activity with a high enhancement factor around 8.82x10^5, attributed
to the coupling between the amorphous shell and the crystalline core.

<h3>Detecting topological phases in the square-octagon lattice with  statistical methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04519</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Wunderlich, Francesco Ferrari, Roser Valentí</i>
<br>
<br>
Electronic systems living on Archimedean lattices such as kagome and
square-octagon networks are presently being intensively discussed for the
possible realization of topological insulating phases. Coining the most
interesting electronic topological states in an unbiased way is however not
straightforward due to the large parameter space of possible Hamiltonians. Here
we focus on the square-octagon lattice and explore via a recently developed
statistical learning method the possible topological phases that can manifest
when the Fermi level of the system lies at a high-order van Hove singularity.
For this purpose, we analyze large data sets of randomized tight-binding
Hamiltonians labeled with the corresponding topological index and, through
feature engineering, we identify the observables that are associated with
non-trivial topological phases. Our analysis provides a recipe to construct
tight-binding Hamiltonians for the insulating phases with Chern number $\pm $1.

<h3>Kondo Effect in Defect-bound Quantum Dots Coupled to NbSe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04571</a>
<br>
<i>T. R. Devidas, Tom Dvir, Enrico Rossi, Hadar Steinberg</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the fabrication of a van der Waals tunneling device hosting a
defect-bound quantum dot coupled to NbSe$_2$. We find that upon application of
magnetic field, the device exhibits a zero-bias conductance peak. The peak,
which splits at higher fields, is associated with a Kondo effect. At the same
time, the junction retains conventional quasiparticle tunneling features at
finite bias. Such coexistence of a superconducting gap and a Kondo effect are
unusual, and are explained by noting the two-gap nature of the superconducting
state of NbSe$_2$, where a magnetic field suppresses the low energy gap
associated with the Se band. Our data shows that van der Waals architectures,
and defect-bound dots in them, can serve as a novel and effective platform for
investigating the interplay of Kondo screening and superconducting pairing in
unconventional superconductors.

<h3>Multiresonances of quasi-trapped modes in metasurfaces based on  nanoparticles of transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04578</a>
<br>
<i>M.Yu. Gubin, A.V. Shesterikov, V.S. Volkov, A.V. Prokhorov</i>
<br>
<br>
The features of polarization control of multiple multiresonances for
quasi-trapped modes excited by synchronization of bianisotropic dipole
responses in MoS$_2$ disks with a hole are considered. Using the numerical
calculations with analytical multipole analysis, we showed that the presence of
a strong optical anisotropy of MoS$_2$ nanoparticles provides an additional
degree of freedom and allows to observe several resonances of electric and
magnetic dipoles at once in a narrow spectral range. Based on the simulation
results, we obtained the frequency dependences for the dipole polarizabilities
of the MoS$_2$ disk with a hole, which allow one to distinguish the
contributions of the nonlocal and bianisotropic dipole responses and possessing
several features in the near infrared range. Using the polarizability spectra
of single nanoparticles and applying the tuning strategy, the design of the
MoS$_2$ metasurface supporting three resonances of quasi-trapped modes at once
in a narrow spectral range was developed. One of these resonances corresponds
to the telecom wavelength of 1550 nm. The spectrum of light reflection for
MoS$_2$ metasurface is characterized by three narrowband dips corresponding to
the wavelengths of the quasi-trapped modes. It was shown that a change in the
polarization of a wave normally incident on the metasurface to orthogonal one
leads to a change in the type of bianisotropic response excited in each MoS$_2$
disk and to the excitation of three other features in the reflection spectra of
the metasurface at wavelengths close to the initial values.

<h3>Effective Dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04580" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04580</a>
<br>
<i>Steven Durr, Youssef Mroueh, Yuhai Tu, Shenshen Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of machine-learning models
that use adversarial training to generate new samples with the same
(potentially very complex) statistics as the training samples. One major form
of training failure, known as mode collapse, involves the generator failing to
reproduce the full diversity of modes in the target probability distribution.
Here, we present an effective model of GAN training, which captures the
learning dynamics by replacing the generator neural network with a collection
of particles in the output space; particles are coupled by a universal kernel
valid for certain wide neural networks and high-dimensional inputs. The
generality of our simplified model allows us to study the conditions under
which mode collapse occurs. Indeed, experiments which vary the effective kernel
of the generator reveal a mode collapse transition, the shape of which can be
related to the type of discriminator through the frequency principle. Further,
we find that gradient regularizers of intermediate strengths can optimally
yield convergence through critical damping of the generator dynamics. Our
effective GAN model thus provides an interpretable physical framework for
understanding and improving adversarial training.

<h3>Theory of the Little-Parks effect in spin-triplet superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04591" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04591</a>
<br>
<i>Chengyun Hua, Eugene Dumitrescu, Gábor B. Halász</i>
<br>
<br>
The celebrated Little-Parks effect in mesoscopic superconducting rings has
recently gained great attention due to its potential to probe half-quantum
vortices in spin-triplet superconductors. However, despite the large number of
works reporting anomalous Little-Parks measurements attributed to
unconventional superconductivity, the general signatures of spin-triplet
pairing in the Little-Parks effect have not yet been systematically
investigated. Here we use Ginzburg-Landau theory to study the Little-Parks
effect in a spin-triplet superconducting ring that supports half-quantum
vortices; we calculate the field-induced Little-Parks oscillations of both the
critical temperature itself and the residual resistance resulting from thermal
vortex tunneling below the critical temperature. We observe two separate
critical temperatures with a single-spin superconducting state in between and
find that, due to the existence of half-quantum vortices, each minimum in the
upper critical temperature splits into two minima for the lower critical
temperature. From a rigorous calculation of the residual resistance, we confirm
that these two minima in the lower critical temperature translate into two
maxima in the residual resistance below and establish the general conditions
under which the two maxima can be practically resolved. In particular, we
identify a fundamental trade-off between sharpening each maximum and keeping
the overall magnitude of the resistance large. Our results will guide
experimental efforts in designing mesoscopic ring geometries for probing
half-quantum vortices in spin-triplet candidate materials on the device scale.

<h3>Modelling Surface Segregation in Compositionally Complex Alloys with  Ab-Initio Accuracy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04597" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04597</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Ferrari, Vadim Sotskov, Alexander V. Shapeev, Fritz Körmann</i>
<br>
<br>
Compositionally complex alloys or concentrated solid solutions are the latest
frontier in catalyst design, but mixing different elements in one catalyst may
result in surface segregation. Atomistic simulations can predict segregation
patterns, but standard approaches based on mean-field models, cluster
expansion, or classical interatomic potentials are often limited for the
description of multicomponent alloys. We present machine learning potentials
that can describe surface segregation with near DFT accuracy. The method is
used to study a complex Co-Cu-Fe-Mo-Ni quinary alloy. For this alloy, an
unexpected segregation of Co, which has a relatively high surface energy, is
observed. We rationalize this surprising mechanism in terms of simple
transition-metal chemistry.

<h3>Tunable Capacitor For Superconducting Qubits Using an InAs/InGaAs  Heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04598" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04598</a>
<br>
<i>Nicholas Materise, Matthieu C. Dartiailh, William M. Strickland, Javad Shabani, Eliot Kapit</i>
<br>
<br>
Adoption of fast, parametric coupling elements has improved the performance
of superconducting qubits, enabling recent demonstrations of quantum advantage
in randomized sampling problems. The development of low loss, high contrast
couplers is critical for scaling up these systems. We present a blueprint for a
gate-tunable coupler realized with a two-dimensional electron gas in an
InAs/InGaAs heterostructure. Rigorous numerical simulations of the
semiconductor and high frequency electromagnetic behavior of the coupler and
microwave circuitry yield an on/off ratio of more than one order of magnitude.
We give an estimate of the dielectric-limited loss from the inclusion of the
coupler in a two qubit system, with coupler coherences ranging from a few to
tens of microseconds.

<h3>Diamond nanomechanical resonators protected by a phononic band gap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04608" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04608</a>
<br>
<i>Xinzhu Li, Ignas Lekavicius, Hailin Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the design, fabrication, and characterization of diamond
cantilevers attached to a phononic square lattice. We show that the robust
protection of mechanical modes by phononic band gaps leads to a
three-orders-of-magnitude increase in mechanical Q-factors, with the Q-factors
exceeding 10^6 at frequencies as high as 100 MHz. Temperature dependent studies
indicate that the Q-factors obtained at a few K are still limited by the
materials loss. The high-Q diamond nanomechanical resonators provide a
promising hybrid quantum system for spin-mechanics studies.

<h3>Meta-generalized gradient approximation of adiabatic connection  semilocal correlation functional</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04610</a>
<br>
<i>Subrata Jana, Szymon Śmiga, Lucian A. Constantin, Prasanjit Samal</i>
<br>
<br>
We have developed a meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA)
correlation energy functional using the adiabatic connection semilocal
correlation (ACSC) approach proposed recently [L. A. Constantin, Phys. Rev. B
99, 085117 (2019)]. The construction is based on the high and low-density
limits of the Tao-Perdew-Starverov-Scuseria (TPSS) correlation energy
functional leading to the TPSS-ACSC density functional approximation, which is
one electron self-interaction free, accurate for strictly correlated, and
quasi-two-dimensional regimes. Based on simple examples, we show the advantages
and disadvantages of ACSC semilocal functionals and provide some new guidelines
for future developments.

<h3>Eigenvalue analysis of stress-strain curve of two-dimensional amorphous  solids of dispersed frictional grains with finite shear strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04628</a>
<br>
<i>Daisuke Ishima, Kuniyasu Saitoh, Michio Otsuki, Hisao Hayakawa</i>
<br>
<br>
The stress-strain curve of two-dimensional frictional dispersed grains
interacting with a harmonic potential without considering the dynamical slip
under a finite strain is determined by using eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian
matrix. After the configuration of grains is obtained, the stress-strain curve
based on the eigenvalue analysis is in almost perfect agreement with that
obtained by the simulation, even if there are plastic deformations caused by
stress avalanches. Unlike the naive expectation, the eigenvalues in our model
do not indicate any precursors to the stress-drop events.

<h3>Chirality-selected crystal growth and spin polarization over centimeters  of transition metal disilicide crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04642</a>
<br>
<i>Yusuke Kousaka, Taisei Sayo, Satoshi Iwasaki, Ryo Saki, Chiho Shimada, Hiroaki Shishido, Yoshihiko Togawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We performed a chirality-controlled crystal growth of transition metal
disilicide NbSi$_{2}$ and TaSi$_{2}$ by using a laser-diode-heated floating
zone (LDFZ) method. The crystal chirality was evaluated in the crystals of
centimeters in length by performing single crystal X-ray diffraction as well as
probing a spin polarization originating from chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS) effect. The crystals of right-handed NbSi$_{2}$ and of left-handed
TaSi$_{2}$ were obtained in the conventional LDFZ crystal growth, while the
left-handed NbSi$_{2}$ and right-handed TaSi$_{2}$ crystals were grown by the
LDFZ method with the composition-gradient feed rods. The spin polarization via
the CISS was observed over centimeters in the NbSi$_{2}$ single crystals and
the sign of the CISS signals was dependent on the chirality of crystals. The
correlation between the crystal chirality and CISS signals indicates that the
CISS measurements work as a non-destructive method for chirality determination
even in centimeter-long specimens.

<h3>Transport in deformed centrosymmetric networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04682</a>
<br>
<i>Adway Kumar Das, Anandamohan Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
Centrosymmetry often mediates Perfect State Transfer (PST) in various complex
systems ranging from quantum wires to photosynthetic networks. We introduce the
Deformed Centrosymmetric Ensemble (DCE) of random matrices, $H(\lambda) \equiv
H_+ + \lambda H_-$, where $H_+$ is centrosymmetric while $H_-$ is
skew-centrosymmetric. The relative strength of the $H_\pm$ prompts the system
size scaling of the control parameter as $\lambda = N^{-\frac{\gamma}{2}}$. We
propose two quantities, $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{C}$, quantifying centro-
and skewcentro-symmetry, respectively, exhibiting second order phase
transitions at $\gamma_\text{P}\equiv 1$ and $\gamma_\text{C}\equiv -1$. In
addition, DCE posses an ergodic transition at $\gamma_\text{E} \equiv 0$. Thus
equipped with a precise control of the extent of centrosymmetry in DCE, we
study the manifestation of $\gamma$ on the transport properties of complex
networks. We propose that such random networks can be constructed using the
eigenvectors of $H(\lambda)$ and establish that the maximum transfer fidelity,
$F_T$, is equivalent to the degree of centrosymmetry, $\mathcal{P}$.

<h3>Purcell factor for plasmon-enhanced metal photoluminescence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04685</a>
<br>
<i>Tigran V. Shahbazyan</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory for plasmonic enhancement of metal photoluminescence
(MPL) in metal nanostructures. In such systems, the primary mechanism of MPL
enhancement is excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSP) by recombining
carriers followed by LSP radiative decay. For plasmonic structures of arbitrary
shape, we derive explicit expressions for the MPL Purcell factor and MPL
spectrum in terms of metal dielectric function and the LSP frequency. We find
that the interference between the direct and LSP-mediated processes explains
the blueshift of MPL spectral peak relative to the LSP resonance in scattering
spectra observed in numerous experiments.

<h3>Effect of surfactants on the elasticity of the liquid--liquid interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04686</a>
<br>
<i>Shunta Kikuchi, Hiroshi Watanabe</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigated the effect of surfactants on an interface between two kinds
of liquid by molecular dynamics simulation. We found that the interfacial
tension significantly depended on the bond length of the modeled surfactants.
Although the structure of the interface changed depending on the magnitude of
the interfacial tension, the interface was stable even under conditions where
the interfacial tension was virtually zero. The Fourier spectrum of the
fluctuations of the surface structure showed a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$
when the interfacial tension was almost zero, where $q$ is the wavenumber. This
means that the bending rigidity is dominant for the restoring force when the
surfactant molecules are sufficiently absorbed on the interface, and the
interfacial tension is almost zero, whereas the interfacial tension is dominant
when the interfacial tension is a finite value.

<h3>The topological Faraday effect cannot be observed in a realistic sample</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04716</a>
<br>
<i>Christian Berger, Florian Bayer, Laurens W. Molenkamp, Tobias Kiessling</i>
<br>
<br>
A striking feature of 3 dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) is the
theoretically expected topological magneto-electric (TME) effect, which gives
rise to additional terms in Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism with an
universal quantized coefficient proportional to half-integer multiples of the
fine structure constant $\alpha$. In an ideal scenario one therefore expects
also quantized contributions in the magneto-optical response of TIs. We review
this premise by taking into account the trivial dielectric background of the TI
bulk and potential host substrates, and the often present contribution of
itinerant bulk carriers. We show that (i) one obtains a non-universal
magneto-optical response whenever there is impedance mismatch between different
layers and (ii) that the detectable signals due to the TME rapidly approach
vanishingly small values as the impedance mismatch is detuned from zero. We
demonstrate that it is methodologically impossible to deduce the existence of a
TME exclusively from an optical experiment in the thin film limit of 3D TIs at
high magnetic fields.

<h3>Theory of X-ray absorption spectroscopy: a microscopic Bloch equation  approach for two-dimensional solid states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04727" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04727</a>
<br>
<i>Dominik Christiansen, Malte Selig, Jens Biegert, Andreas Knorr</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a self-consistent Maxwell-Bloch formalism for the interaction of
X-rays with two-dimensional crystalline materials by incorporating the Bloch
theorem and Coulomb many-body interaction. This formalism is illustrated for
graphene, by calculating the polarization-dependent XANES, formulating
expressions for the radiative and Meinter-Auger recombination of core-holes,
and the discussion of microscopic insights into the spectral oscillations of
EXAFS beyond point scattering theory. In particular, the correct inclusion of
lattice periodicity in our evaluation allows us to assign so far uninterpreted
spectral features in the Fourier transformed EXAFS spectrum.

<h3>Evidence of large Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction at the  cobalt/hexagonal boron nitride interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04768</a>
<br>
<i>Banan El-Kerdi, André Thiaville, Stanislas Rohart, Sujit Panigrahy, Nuno Brás, João Sampaio, Alexandra Mougin</i>
<br>
<br>
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is used in 2D van der Waals heterostructures
as a neutral material, often with a passivation role. However, here we show
that h-BN deposited on ultra-thin Co film induces large Dzyaloshinskii Moriya
interaction (DMI) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Clean Co/h-BN
were obtained by combining ultra-high vacuum growth and mechanical exfoliation.
DMI and PMA are measured using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy on
series of samples of varying Co thickness grown on Pt or Au and covered either
with h-BN or Cu. By comparing the h-BN-covered samples with their corresponding
control Cu-covered samples, the effect of the Co/h-BN interface is extracted.
This reveals that the Co/h-BN interface induces a large PMA and DMI comparable
in strength to the largest known effects, such as those of the Pt/Co interface.
This effect can be combined to that of Pt/Co in Pt/Co/h-BN films, to produce an
even larger PMA and DMI. This enables the stabilisation of skyrmions in the
Pt/Co/h-BN system, as was observed at room temperature with low magnetic
fields. Our findings further expand the applications of h-BN, paving the way
for using h-BN as functional material in the field of spintronics despite its
weak spin-orbit interaction.

Anomalous resistance upturn and downturn have been observed on the
topological insulator (TI) surface in superconductor-TI (NbN-Bi1.95Sb0.05Se3)
heterostructures at ~ mm length scales away from the interface.
Magnetotransport measurements were performed to verify that the anomaly is
caused due to the superconducting transition of the NbN layer. The possibility
of long range superconducting proximity effect due to the spin-polarized TI
surface state was ruled out due to the observation of similar anomaly in NbN-Au
and NbN-Al heterostructures. It was discovered that the unusual resistance
jumps were caused due to current redistribution at the superconductor-TI
interface on account of the geometry effects. Results obtained from finite
element analysis using COMSOL package has validated the proposed current
redistribution (CRD) model of long range resistance anomalies in
superconductor-TI and superconductor-metal heterostructures.

The recent discovery of the strongly correlated phases in magic angle twisted
bilayer graphene heralded a new area of investigation into the
strongly-correlation physics in graphene. This is remarkably different from the
initial period of graphene research which was dominated by interest in one body
physics of massless Dirac fermions. This pedagogical review article provides a
self-contained theoretical perspective of the journey of the wonder material
graphene from its single-particle physics dominated regime to the flat band
regime of strong-correlation physics. Starting from the origin of Dirac points
in condensed matter systems, along this road, this review discusses the effect
of superlattice on the Fermi velocity and Van Hove singularities in the
dispersion relation of the graphene, and how it naturally leads to
investigation into Moir\'e pattern in Van der Wall's heterostructure such as
graphene-hexagonal boron-nitride and twisted bilayer graphene. Subsequently It
discusses in detail the origin of flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene at the
magic angles. by analysing in detail a number of prominent theoretical works in
this direction. The theoretical description is intercepted at appropriate
places by connecting it with the relevant experimental works. In a final
section we also provide a list of the topics in the field of twisted bilayer
graphene that are not covered in this review, but can be approached with the
help of this primer.

<br>
<br>
TaAs, the first experimentally discovered Weyl semimetal material, has
attracted a lot of attention due to its high carrier mobility, high anisotropy,
nonmagnetic and strong interaction with light. These make it an ideal candidate
for the study of Weyl fermions and the applications in quantum computation,
thermoelectric devices, and photodetection. For further basic physics studies
and potential applications, large-size and high-quality TaAs films are urgently
needed. However, it is difficult to grow As-stoichiometry TaAs films due to the
volatilization of As during the growth. To solve this problem, the TaAs films
were attempted to grow on different substrates using targets with different As
stoichiometric ratios by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In this work, we have
found that partial As ions of the GaAs substrate are likely to diffuse into the
TaAs films during growth, which was preliminarily confirmed by the structural
characterization, surface topography and composition analysis. As a result, the
As content in the TaAs film is improved and the TaAs phase is achieved. Our
work presents an effective method to fabricate the TaAs films by PLD, providing
the possible use of the Weyl semimetal film for functional devices.

Computational materials science is increasingly benefitting from data
management, automation, and algorithm-based decision-making in controlling
simulations. Experimental materials science is also undergoing a change and
increasingly more `machine learning' is incorporated in materials discovery
campaigns. The obvious benefits include automation, reproducibility, data
provenance, and reusability of managed data, however, is not widely available.
We demonstrate an implementation of a Gaussian Process Regression directly
controlling an experimental measurement device in pyiron, a framework designed
for high-throughput simulations, as a first step to increasingly combine
experimental and simulated data in one framework. With data from both in the
same framework, a heretofore untapped and much-needed potential for the
acceleration of materials characterization and materials discovery campaigns
becomes available.

Synthesis of high-entropy carbides (HEC) requires high temperatures that can
be provided by electric arc plasma method. However, the formation temperature
of a single-phase sample remains unknown. Moreover, under some temperatures
multi-phase structures can emerge. In this work we developed an approach for a
controllable synthesis of HEC TiZrNbHfTaC5 based on theoretical and
experimental techniques. We used canonical Monte Carlo (CMC) simulations with
the machine learning interatomic potentials to determine the temperature
conditions for the formation of single-phase and multi-phase samples. In full
agreement with the theory, the single-phase sample, produced with electric arc
discharge, was observed at 2000 K. Below 1200 K the sample decomposed into
(Ti-Nb-Ta)C and a mixture of (Zr-Hf-Ta)C, (Zr-Nb-Hf)C, (Zr-Nb)C, and (Zr-Ta)C.
Our results demonstrate the conditions for the formation of HEC and we
anticipate that our approach can pave the way towards targeted synthesis of
multicomponent materials.

We studied the ground state phase diagram of spin-1/2 J1-J2 XY model on the
square lattice with first- J1 and second-neighbor J2 antiferromagnetic
interactions using both iDMRG and DMRG approaches. We show that a plaquette
valence bond phase is realized in an intermediate region 0.50 <= J2/J1 <= 0.54
between a N\'eel magnetic ordered phase at J2/J1 < 0.50 and a stripy magnetic
ordered phase at J2/J1 >= 0.54. The plaquette valence bond phase is
characterized by finite dimer orders in both the horizontal and vertical
directions. Contrary to the spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg model, we do not find
numerical evidence for a quantum spin liquid phase in the J1-J2 XY model.

<h3>An \textit{ab initio} study of magnetic structure transitions of  FePS$_3$ under high pressure</h3>

Recent experimental work shows that FePS$_3$ undergoes phase transitions from
$C2/m$ ($\beta\sim107^{\circ}$) to $C2/m$ ($\beta\sim90^{\circ}$) at $6$ GPa
and then to metallic $P\bar{3}1m$ at $14$ GPa, with the magnetic ordering wave
vector turning from $k=(01\frac{1}{2})$ to $k=(010)$ at $2$ GPa and to
short-range magnetic order accompanying the insulator-metal transition. By
preserving the magnetic point groups in $ab \ initio$ calculations we report
the following: (1) We successfully reproduce the first magnetic structure
transition at $1.2$ GPa and briefly discuss the influence of the Hubbard U
parameter on this transition. This isostructural transition causes a change of
the Brillouin zone from base-centered monoclinic to primitive monoclinic, and
an indrect band gap to direct band gap transition. (2) There is a rotation of
the Fe-S octahedron about $0.5^\circ$ through the $[001]$ axis before the
neighboring layers shift. (3) The shift between neighboring layers is predicted
to occur at $10.0$ GPa and reverses the energy order between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{xy}$. (4) A sudden decrease of Fe-S bond length to $2.20$ \AA \ accompanies
the vanishing of magnetic moment in the insulator-metal transition. Our work
shows the importance of symmetries of magnetic structures in pressure-induced
phase transition of magnetic systems.

We study analytically an analog of the Andreev reflection at a
normal-superfluid interface. The polariton gapped superfluid region is achieved
by quasi-resonant optical pumping. The interacting polaritons are described
with the driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We find analytical
formulas for the angles and amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted
particles. There are limit angles and energies, above which Andreev
reflection/transmission cannot be observed anymore and where the Andreev wave
becomes a surface mode, exponentially localized on the interface. These
properties are confirmed by solving numerically the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
in simulations reproducing realistic experimental conditions.

Floquet modulation has been widely used in optical lattices for coherent
control of quantum gases, in particular for synthesizing artificial gauge
fields and simulating topological matters. However, such modulation induces
heating which can overwhelm the signal of quantum dynamics in ultracold atoms.
Here we report that the thermal motion, instead of being a noise source,
provides a new control knob in Floquet-modulated superradiance lattices, which
are momentum-space tight-binding lattices of collectively excited states of
atoms. The Doppler shifts combined with Floquet modulation provide effective
forces along arbitrary directions in a lattice in frequency and momentum
dimensions. Dynamic localization, dynamic delocalization and chiral edge
currents can be simultaneously observed from a single transport spectrum of
superradiance lattices in thermal atoms. Our work paves a way for simulating
Floquet topological matters in room-temperature atoms and facilitates their
applications in photonic devices.

<h3>Current-induced mechanical torque in chiral molecular rotors</h3>

A great endeavor has been undertaken to engineer molecular rotors operated by
an electrical current. A frequently met operation principle is the transfer of
angular momentum taken from the incident flux. In this paper we present an
alternative driving agent that works also in situations where angular momentum
of the incoming flux is conserved. This situation arises typically with
molecular rotors that exhibit an easy axis of rotation. For quantitative
analysis we investigate here a classical model, where molecule and wires are
represented by a rigid curved path. We demonstrate that in the presence of
chirality the rotor generically undergoes a directed motion, provided that the
incident current exceeds a threshold value. Above threshold, the corresponding
rotation frequency (per incoming particle current) for helical geometries turns
out to be $2\pi m/M_1$, where $m/M_1$ is the ratio of the mass of an incident
charge carrier and the mass of the helix per winding number.

Inducing and controlling spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene is key to
create topological states of matter, and for the realization of spintronic
devices. Placing graphene onto a transition metal dichalcogenide is currently
the most successful strategy to achieve this goal, but there is no consensus as
to the nature and the magnitude of the induced SOC. Here, we show that the
presence of backscattering in graphene-on-WSe$_2$ heterostructures can be used
to probe SOC and to determine its strength quantitatively, by imaging
quasiparticle interference with a scanning tunneling microscope. A detailed
theoretical analysis of the Fourier transform of quasiparticle interference
images reveals that the induced SOC consists of a valley-Zeeman
($\lambda_{\text{vZ}}\approx 2$ meV) and a Rashba ($\lambda_\text{R}\approx 15$
meV) term, one order of magnitude larger than what theory predicts, but in
excellent agreement with earlier transport experiments. The validity of our
analysis is confirmed by measurements on a 30 degree twist angle
heterostructure that exhibits no backscattering, as expected from symmetry
considerations. Our results demonstrate a viable strategy to determine SOC
quantitatively by imaging quasiparticle interference.

<h3>Simulating first-order phase transition with hierarchical autoregressive  networks</h3>

We apply the Hierarchical Autoregressive Neural (HAN) network sampling
algorithm to the two-dimensional $Q$-state Potts model and perform simulations
around the phase transition at $Q=12$. We quantify the performance of the
approach in the vicinity of the first-order phase transition and compare it
with that of the Wolff cluster algorithm. We find a significant improvement as
far as the statistical uncertainty is concerned at a similar numerical effort.
In order to efficiently train large neural networks we introduce the technique
of pre-training. It allows to train some neural networks using smaller system
sizes and then employing them as starting configurations for larger system
sizes. This is possible due to the recursive construction of our hierarchical
approach. Our results serve as a demonstration of the performance of the
hierarchical approach for systems exhibiting bimodal distributions.
Additionally, we provide estimates of the free energy and entropy in the
vicinity of the phase transition with statistical uncertainties of the order of
$10^{-7}$ for the former and $10^{-3}$ for the latter based on a statistics of
$10^6$ configurations.

Key technologies in energy conversion and storage, sensing and chemical
synthesis rely on a detailed knowledge about charge transfer processes at
electrified solid-liquid interfaces. However, these interfaces continuously
evolve as a function of applied potentials, ionic concentrations and time. We
therefore need to characterize chemical composition, atomic arrangement and
electronic structure of both the liquid and the solid side of the interface
under operating conditions. In this chapter, we discuss the state-of-the-art
X-ray based spectroscopy and diffraction approaches for such 'operando'
characterization. We highlight recent examples from literature and demonstrate
how X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface
X-ray diffraction can reveal the required interface-sensitive information.

<h3>Understanding the physics of hydrophobic solvation</h3>

Simulations of water near extended hydrophobic spherical solutes have
revealed the presence of a region of depleted density and accompanying enhanced
density fluctuations.The physical origin of both phenomena has remained
somewhat obscure. We investigate these effects employing a mesoscopic binding
potential analysis, classical density functional theory (DFT) calculations for
a simple Lennard-Jones (LJ) solvent and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)
simulations of a monatomic water (mw) model. We argue that the density
depletion and enhanced fluctuations are near-critical phenomena. Specifically,
we show that they can be viewed as remnants of the critical drying surface
phase transition that occurs at bulk liquid-vapor coexistence in the
macroscopic planar limit, i.e.~as the solute radius $R_s\to\infty$. Focusing on
the radial density profile $\rho(r)$ and a sensitive spatial measure of
fluctuations, the local compressibility profile $\chi(r)$, our binding
potential analysis provides explicit predictions for the manner in which the
key features of $\rho(r)$ and $\chi(r)$ scale with $R_s$, the strength of
solute-water attraction $\varepsilon_{sf}$, and the deviation from liquid-vapor
coexistence of the chemical potential, $\delta\mu$. These scaling predictions
are confirmed by our DFT calculations and GCMC simulations. As such our theory
provides a firm basis for understanding the physics of hydrophobic solvation.

<h3>2D interfacial diffusion model of inhibitory synaptic receptor dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05010</a>

<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
The lateral diffusion and trapping of protein receptors within the
postsynaptic membrane of a neuron plays a key role in determining the strength
of synaptic connections and their regulation during learning and memory. In
this paper we construct and analyze a 2D interfacial diffusion model of
inhibitory synaptic receptor dynamics. The model involves three major
components. First, the boundary of each synapse is treated as a semi-permeable
interface due to the effects of cytoskeletal structures. Second, the effective
diffusivity within a synapse is taken to be smaller than the extrasynaptic
diffusivity due to the temporary binding to scaffold protein buffers within the
synapse. Third, receptors from intracellular pools are inserted into the
membrane extrasynaptically and internalized extrasynaptically and synaptically.
We first solve the model equations for a single synapse in an unbounded domain
and explore how the non-equilibrium steady-state number of synaptic receptors
depends on model parameters. We then use matched asymptotic analysis to solve
the corresponding problem of multiple synapses in a large, bounded domain.
Finally, treating a synapse as a phase separated condensate of scaffold
proteins, we describe how diffusion of individual scaffold proteins can also be
modeled in terms of interfacial diffusion. We thus establish interfacial
diffusion as a general paradigm for exploring synaptic dynamics and plasticity.

<h3>Ultraslow settling kinetics of frictional cohesive powders</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Using discrete element method simulations, we show that the settling of
frictional cohesive grains under ramped-pressure compression exhibits strong
history dependence and slow dynamics that are not present for grains that lack
either cohesion or friction. Systems prepared by beginning with a dilute state
and then ramping the pressure to a small positive value $P_{\rm final}$ over a
time $\tau_{\rm ramp}$ settle at packing fractions given by an
inverse-logarithmic rate law, $\phi_{\rm settled}(\tau_{\rm ramp}) = \phi_{\rm
settled}(\infty) + A/[1 + B\ln(1 + \tau_{\rm ramp}/\tau_{\rm slow})]$. This law
is analogous to the one obtained from classical tapping experiments on
noncohesive grains, but crucially different in that $\tau_{\rm slow}$ is set by
the slow dynamics of structural void stabilization rather than the faster
dynamics of bulk densification. We formulate a kinetic free-void-volume theory
that predicts this $\phi_{\rm settled}(\tau_{\rm ramp})$, with $\phi_{\rm
settled}(\infty) = \phi_{\rm ALP}$ and $A = \phi_{\rm settled}(0) - \phi_{\rm
ALP}$, where $\phi_{\rm ALP} \equiv .135$ is the ``adhesive loose packing''
fraction found by Liu \textit{et al.} [W.\ Liu, Y.\ Jin, S. Chen, H.\ A.\ Makse
and S.\ Li, \textit{Soft Matt.} \textbf{13}, 421 (2017)].

In this letter, we report a high remnant polarization, 2P$_r$ >
70$\mu$C/cm$^2$ in thermally processed atomic layer deposited
Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO) film on Silicon with NH$_3$ plasma exposed thin
TiN interlayer and Tungsten (W) as a top electrode. The effect of interlayer on
the ferroelectric properties of HZO is compared with standard
Metal-Ferroelectric-Metal and Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor structures. The
x-ray diffraction confirms that the thickness of the interlayer plays an
important role to enhance the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase. The HRTEM
images reveal that TiN acts as a seed layer for the local epitaxy in HZO and
hence a 2X improvement in remnant polarization. Finally, the HZO devices are
shown to be wake-up free, and exhibit endurance $>10^6$ cycles. This study
opens a pathway to achieve epitaxial ferroelectric HZO films on Si with
improved memory performance.

The sheet samples of thermally exfoliated graphite (TEG) carbon nanotubes

chemical (CO) and electrochemical (anode) oxidation (ECAO). Electron microscopy
reveals multi layered structures of few layer graphene nanosheets with folded
and tubular like fragments.Electron microscopy reveals multilayered structures
of few layer graphene nanosheets with folded and tubular like fragments. The
effective thermal diffusivity values were estimated by nonstationary
photo-pyroelectric thermophysical characterization using the heat pulse and
thermo-wave modulation methods. Comparison with other carbon (C) based thermal
management materials shows that TEG CNTcs exhibit thermal diffusivity,
effusivity and conductivity comparable with those of actual C polymer and C C
composites. For TEG CNT cs, evaluated values of phonon mean free path (MFP) and
relaxation time (RT) are in the ranges estimated for defective graphene. The
values of diffusivity and effusivity, MFP and RT are lower for denser TEG CNT
cs obtained by ECAO and are higher for less dense TEG CNT cs obtained by CO.
The obtained diffusivity and effusivity values designate TEG CNT cs as suitable
thermal management materials.

Presented in this thesis are a set of projects which lie at the intersection
between strong correlations and topological phases of matter. The first of
these projects is a treatment of an infinite dimensional generalization of the
SSH model with local Coulomb interactions which is solved exactly using
DMFT-NRG. Observed in the solution is power-law augmentation of the
non-interacting density of states, as well as a Mott transition. This
calculation represents an exact solution to an interacting topological
insulator in the strongly correlated regime at zero temperature. The second set
of projects involves the development of methods for formulating non-interacting
auxiliary models for strongly correlated systems. These auxiliary models are
able to capture the full dynamics of the original strongly correlated model,
but with only completely non-interacting degrees of freedom, defined in an
enlarged Hilbert space. We motivate the discussion by performing the mapping
analytically for simple interacting systems using non-linear canonical
transformations via a Majorana decomposition. For the nontrivial class of
interacting quantum impurity models, the auxiliary mapping is established
numerically exactly for finite-size systems using exact diagonalization, and
for impurity models in the thermodynamic limit using NRG, both at zero and
finite temperature. We find that the auxiliary systems take the form of
generalized SSH models, which inherit the topological characteristics of those
models. These generalized SSH models are also formalized and investigated in
their own right as novel systems. Finally, we apply this methodology to study
the Mott transition in the Hubbard model. In terms of the auxiliary system, we
find that the Mott transition can be understood as a topological phase
transition, which manifests as the formation and dissociation of topological
domain walls.

<h3>Photonic topological Anderson insulator in a two-dimensional atomic  lattice</h3>

Disorder in atomic positions can induce a topologically nontrivial phase -
topological Anderson insulator (TAI) - for transverse electric optical
quasimodes of a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of immobile atoms. TAI
requires both time-reversal and inversion symmetries to be broken to similar
extents. It is characterized by a nonzero topological invariant, a reduced
density of states and spatially localized quasimodes in the bulk, as well as
propagating edge states. A transition from TAI to the topological insulator
(TI) phase can take place at a constant value of the topological invariant,
showing that TAI and TI represent the same topological phase. The interplay
between topology and disorder for light in the considered atomic lattice is
strongly affected by the suppression of Anderson localization due to
longitudinal optical fields, which makes it different from the corresponding
interplay in electronic systems and calls for a separate detailed study.
