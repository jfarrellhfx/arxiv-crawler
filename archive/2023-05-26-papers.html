<h3>Superdiffusion from nonabelian symmetries in nearly integrable systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15463</a>

The Heisenberg spin chain is a canonical integrable model. As such, it
features stable ballistically propagating quasiparticles, but spin transport is
sub-ballistic at any nonzero temperature: an initially localized spin
fluctuation spreads in time $t$ to a width $t^{2/3}$. This exponent, as well as
the functional form of the dynamical spin correlation function, suggest that
spin transport is in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. However,
the full counting statistics of magnetization is manifestly incompatible with
KPZ scaling. A simple two-mode hydrodynamic description, derivable from
microscopic principles, captures both the KPZ scaling of the correlation
function and the coarse features of the full counting statistics, but remains
to be numerically validated. These results generalize to any integrable spin
chain invariant under a continuous nonabelian symmetry, and are surprisingly
robust against moderately strong integrability-breaking perturbations that
respect the nonabelian symmetry.

<h3>Thermodynamics and fractal Drude weights in the sine-Gordon model</h3>

The sine-Gordon model is a paradigmatic quantum field theory that provides
the low-energy effective description of many gapped 1D systems. Despite this
fact, its complete thermodynamic description in all its regimes has been
lacking. Here we fill this gap and derive the framework that captures its
thermodynamics and serves as the basis of its hydrodynamic description. As a
first application, we compute the Drude weight characterising the ballistic
transport of topological charge and demonstrate that its dependence on the
value of the coupling shows a fractal structure, similar to the gapless phase
of the XXZ spin chain. The thermodynamic framework can be applied to study
other features of non-equilibrium dynamics in the sine-Gordon model using
generalised hydrodynamics, opening the way to a wide array of theoretical
studies and potential novel experimental predictions.

using machine learning to predict crystal structure phases from X-ray
diffraction data of transition metals and their oxides. We evaluate the
performance of our method and compare the variety of its settings. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed machine learning framework achieves competitive

<h3>Two-dimensional layered materials meet perovskite oxides: A combination  for high-performance electronic devices</h3>

As the Si-based transistors scale down to atomic dimensions, the basic
principle of current electronics, which heavily relies on the tunable charge
degree of freedom, faces increasing challenges to meet the future requirements
of speed, switching energy, heat dissipation, packing density as well as
functionalities. Heterogeneous integration, where dissimilar layers of
materials and functionalities are unrestrictedly stacked at an atomic scale, is
appealing to next-generation electronics, such as multi-functional,
neuromorphic, spintronic and ultra-low power devices, because it unlocks
technologically useful interfaces of distinct functionalities. Recently, the
combination of functional perovskite oxides and the two-dimensional layered
materials (2DLMs) led to unexpected functionalities and enhanced device
performance. In this review, we review the recent progress of the heterogeneous
integration of perovskite oxides and 2DLMs from the perspectives of fabrication
and interfacial properties, electronic applications, challenges as well as
outlooks. In particular, we focus on three types of attractive applications,
namely field-effect transistors, memory, and neuromorphic electronics. The van
der Waals integration approach is extendible to other oxides and 2DLMs, leading
to almost unlimited combinations of oxides and 2DLMs and contributing to future
high-performance electronic and spintronic devices.

<h3>Pentamodes: the role of unit cell base topology on mechanical properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15419</a>
<br>
<i>Moein Shafia, Kaivan Mohammadi, Javad Akbari, Reza Hedayati</i>
<br>
<br>
Pentamodes (first conceived theoretically by Milton and Cherkaev) are a very
interesting class of mechanical metamaterials where the bulk and shear moduli
are decoupled. The pentamodes usually are composed of double cone-shaped struts
with the middle diameter being large and the end diameters being tiny (ideally
approaching zero). The cubic diamond geometry was proposed by Milton and
Cherkaev as a suitable geometry for the unit cell and has since been used in
the majority of the works on pentamodes. In this work, we aim to evaluate the
degree to which the main unit cell design is contributing to high bulk to shear
modulus ratio (known as FOM). In addition to the diamond unit cell, three other
well-known unit cell designs are considered, and the effect of small diameter
radius and the ratio of large-to-small diameter ratio, {\alpha}, on the FOM is
evaluated. The results showed that regardless of the primitive unit cell shape,
the FOM value is highly dependent on the d value, but its dependence on the D
value is very weak. For d/h around 0.05 (h representing the linkage length),
figures of merit in the range of 10^3 could be reached for all the studied
topologies.

<h3>Modeling Interlayer Interactions and Phonon Thermal Transport in  Silicene Bilayer</h3>

We develop an accurate interlayer pairwise potential derived from the
$\textit{ab-initio}$ calculations and investigate the thermal transport of
silicene bilayers within the framework of equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations. We find that the electronic properties are sensitive to the
temperature with the opening of band gap in the $\Gamma\rightarrow M$ direction
at the room temperature. The calculated phonon thermal conductivity of bilayer
silicene is surprisingly higher than that of the monolayer silicene, contrary
to the trends reported for other class of 2D materials like graphene and hBN
bilayers. We attribute this counterintuitive result to the higher velocity of
LA$_1$/LA$_2$ phonon modes arising from the interlayer interaction effects and
buckling, inherent to silicene bilayer. Interestingly, the thermal conductivity
of both the mono- and bilayer silicene decreases with temperature as
$\kappa\sim T^{-0.9}$ because of the strong correlations between heat current
decay characteristic timescales and temperature ($\tau\sim T^{-0.75}$). The
mechanisms underlying phonon thermal transport in silicene bilayer are further
established by analyzing the temperature induced changes in acoustic group
velocity.

<h3>Existence of nodal-arc and its evolution into Weyl-nodes in the presence  of spin-orbit coupling in TaAs & TaP</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15432</a>
<br>
<i>Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we report the existence of nodal-arc, which acts as the
building block of all the nodal-rings in TaAs & TaP. This nodal-arc is found to
be capable of generating all the nodal-rings in these materials upon the
application of space-group symmetry operations including time-reversal
symmetry. The arcs are obtained to be dispersive with the energy spread of
$\sim$109 ($\sim$204) meV in TaAs (TaP). Also, the orbitals leading to
bands-inversion and thus the formation of nodal-arcs are found to be Ta-5d &
As-4p (P-3p) in TaAs (TaP). The area of nodal-rings is found to be highly
sensitive to the change in hybridization-strength, where the increase in
hybridization-strength leads to the decrease in the area of nodal-rings. In the
presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), all the points on these arcs get
gaped-up and two pairs of Weyl-nodes are found to evolve from them. Out of the
two pair, one is found to be situated close to the joining point of the two
arcs forming a ring. This causes the evolution of each nodal-ring into three
pairs of Weyl-nodes. The coordinates of these Weyl-nodes are found to be robust
to the increase in SOC-strength from $\sim$ 0.7-3.5 eV. All the results are
obtained at the first-principle level. This work provides a clear picture of
the existence of nodal-arc due to accidental degeneracy and its evolution into
Weyl-nodes under the effect of SOC.

<h3>Ultralong 100 ns Spin Relaxation Time in Graphite at Room Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15433</a>
<br>
<i>B. G. Márkus, M. Gmitra, B. Dóra, G. Csősz, T. Fehér, P. Szirmai, B. Náfrádi, V. Zólyomi, L. Forró, J. Fabian, F. Simon</i>
<br>
<br>
Graphite has been intensively studied, yet its electron spins dynamics
remains an unresolved problem even 70 years after the first experiments. The
central quantities, the longitudinal ($T_1$) and transverse ($T_2$) relaxation
times were postulated to be equal, mirroring standard metals, but $T_1$ has
never been measured for graphite. Here, based on a detailed band structure
calculation including spin-orbit coupling, we predict an unexpected behavior of
the relaxation times. We find, based on saturation ESR measurements, that $T_1$
is markedly different from $T_2$. Spins injected with perpendicular
polarization with respect to the graphene plane have an extraordinarily long
lifetime of $100$ ns at room temperature. This is ten times more than in the
best graphene samples. The spin diffusion length across graphite planes is thus
expected to be ultralong, on the scale of $\sim 70~\mu$m, suggesting that thin
films of graphite -- or multilayer AB graphene stacks -- can be excellent
platforms for spintronics applications compatible with 2D van der Waals
technologies. Finally, we provide a qualitative account of the observed spin
relaxation based on the anisotropic spin admixture of the Bloch states in
graphite obtained from density functional theory calculations.

<h3>Kagome Materials I: SG 191, ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Flat Phonon Soft Modes and  Unconventional CDW Formation: Microscopic and Effective Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15469" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15469</a>

<br>
<br>
Kagome Materials with flat bands exhibit wildly different physical properties
depending on symmetry group, and electron number. For the case of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$
in space group 191, we investigate the existence of a charge density wave (CDW)
at vector $\bar{K}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ and its relationship
with the phonon behavior. The experimental findings reveal a $\sim$95K CDW
without nesting/peaks in the electron susceptibility at $\bar{K}$. Notably,
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibits a collapsed phonon mode at
$H=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ and an imaginary flat phonon band in
the vicinity of $H$. The soft phonon is attributed to triangular Sn ($Sn^T$)
mirror-even vibrations along the $z$-direction. We develop a simple force
constant model to describe the entire soft phonon dispersion. By employing a
new (Gaussian) approximation of the hopping parameter, we demonstrate the
renormalization of the phonon frequency and the consequent collapse of the $H$
phonon. Additionally, we propose an effective model with two order parameters
(OPs) to explain the appearance of the CDW at $\bar{K}$, which competes with
the collapsed phonon at $H$. Through comparisons with experimental data, we
show that the $H$ OP undergoes a second-order phase transition while exhibiting
substantial fluctuations, ultimately inducing the first-order transition of the
$\bar{K}$ OP. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the similar compound
YV$_6$Sn$_6$, which lacks a CDW phase, attributing this difference to the
participation of the heavier Y atom in the out-of-plane phonon behavior. Our
comprehensive study not only elucidates the CDW in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ but also
presents a significant advancement in modeling complex electronic systems,
fostering collaborations between ab-initio simulations and analytical
approaches.

<h3>Localization spectrum of a bath-coupled generalized Aubry-André model  in the presence of interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15471" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15471</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ting Tu, DinhDuy Vu, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
A generalization of the Aubry-Andr\'e model, the non-interacting GPD model
introduced in S. Ganeshan et al.,[ Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 146601 (2015)], is
known analytically to possess a mobility edge, allowing both extended and
localized eigenstates to coexist. This mobility edge has been hypothesized to
survive in closed many-body interacting systems, giving rise to a new
non-ergodic metallic phase. In this work, coupling the interacting GPD model to
a thermal bath, we provide direct numerical evidence for multiple qualitative
behaviors in the parameter space of disorder strength and energy level. In
particular, we look at the bath-induced saturation of entanglement entropy to
classify three behaviors: thermalized, non-ergodic extended, and localized. We
also extract the localization length in the localized phase using the long-time
dynamics of the entanglement entropy and the spin imbalance. Our work
demonstrates the rich localization landscape of generalized Aubry-Andr\'e
models containing mobility edges in contrast to the simple Aubry-Andr\'e model
with no mobility edge.

<h3>Inhomogeneity-Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Cuprate  Twist-Junctions</h3>

<br>
The lowest order Josephson coupling, $J_1(\theta)\cos(\phi)$, between two
d-wave superconductors with phase-difference $\phi$ across the junction
vanishes when their relative orientation is rotated by $\theta=\pi/4$. However,
in the presence of inhomogeneity, $J_{1}(\mathbf{r})$ is non-zero locally, with
a sign that fluctuates in space. We show that such a random $J_1$ generates a
global second-harmonic Josephson coupling, $J_2\cos(2\phi)$, with a sign that
favors $\phi = \pm \pi/2$, i.e., spontaneous breaking of time reversal
symmetry. The magnitude of $J_2$ is substantially enhanced if the spatial
correlations of $J_1(\mathbf{r})$ extend over large distances, such as would be
expected in the presence of large amplitude twist-angle angle disorder or
significant local electronic nematicity. We argue that this effect likely
accounts for the recent observations in twisted Josephson junctions between
high temperature superconductors.

<h3>Unraveling spin dynamics from charge fluctuations</h3>

The use of single electron spins in quantum dots as qubits requires detailed
knowledge about the processes involved in their initialization and operation as
well as their relaxation and decoherence. In optical schemes for such spin
qubits, spin-flip Raman as well as Auger processes play an important role, in
addition to environment-induced spin relaxation. In this paper, we demonstrate
how to quantitatively access all the spin-related processes in one go by
monitoring the charge fluctuations of the quantum dot. For this, we employ
resonance fluorescence and analyze the charge fluctuations in terms of
waiting-time distributions and full counting statistics characterized by
factorial cumulants.

Localized states in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) have been the subject of intense study, driven by potential
applications in quantum information science. Despite the rapidly growing
knowledge surrounding these emitters, their microscopic nature is still not
fully understood, limiting their production and application. Motivated by this
challenge, and by recent theoretical and experimental evidence showing that
nanowrinkles generate localized room-temperature emitters, we demonstrate a
method to intentionally induce wrinkles with collections of stressors, showing
that long-range wrinkle direction and position are controllable with patterned
array design. Nano-photoluminescence (nano-PL) imaging combined with detailed
strain modeling based on measured wrinkle topography establishes a correlation
between wrinkle properties, particularly shear strain, and localized exciton
emission. Beyond the array-induced super-wrinkles, nano-PL spatial maps further
reveal that the strain environment around individual stressors is heterogeneous
due to the presence of fine wrinkles that are less deterministic. Detailed
nanoscale hyperspectral images uncover a wide range of low-energy emission
peaks originating from these fine wrinkles, and show that the states can be
tightly confined to regions < 10 nm, even in ambient conditions. These results
establish a promising potential route towards realizing room temperature
quantum emission in 2D TMDC systems.

<h3>Local control for the collective dynamics of self-propelled particles</h3>

<i>Everton S. Medeiros, Ulrike Feudel</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a paradigmatic model for the motion of interacting self-propelled
particles, we demonstrate that local accelerations at the level of individual
particles can drive transitions between different collective dynamics. We find
that the ability to trigger such transitions is hierarchically distributed
among the particles, forming distinctive spatial patterns within the
collective. Chaotic dynamics occur during the transitions, which can be
attributed to fractal basin boundaries mediating the process. The hierarchical
patterns reported here provide decentralized capabilities for controlling
artificial swarms.

<h3>Non-Gaussian dynamics of quantum fluctuations and mean-field limit in  open quantum central spin systems</h3>

We consider quantum spin systems in which a central spin is singled out and
interacts nonlocally with all other bath spins. These systems show complex
stationary phenomena and very distinct dynamical regimes which, despite the
collective nature of the interaction, are still largely not understood. Here,
we derive exact analytical results on the emergent dynamical behavior of open
quantum central spin systems. The latter crucially depends on the scaling of
the interaction strength with the bath size. For scalings with the inverse
square root of the bath size (typical of one-to-many interactions), the system
behaves, in the thermodynamic limit, as an open quantum (spin-boson)
Jaynes-Cummings model, whose bosonic mode encodes the quantum fluctuations of
the bath spins. In this regime, non-Gaussian correlations are dynamically
generated and persist at stationarity. For scalings with the inverse bath size,
the emergent dynamics is instead of mean-field type. Our work provides a
fundamental understanding of the different dynamical regimes of central spin
systems and opens up the possibility of efficiently exploring their
nonequilibrium behavior. It further highlights a non-mean-field theory that may
become relevant for open quantum many-body systems in general.

<h3>Inverse square Levy walk emerging universally in goal-oriented tasks</h3>

The Levy walk in which the frequency of occurrence of step lengths follows a
power-law distribution, can be observed in the migratory behavior of organisms
at various levels. Levy walks with power exponents close to 2 are observed, and
the reasons are unclear. This study aims to propose a model that universally
generates inverse square Levy walks (called Cauchy walks) and to identify the
conditions under which Cauchy walks appear. We demonstrate that Cauchy walks
emerge universally in goal-oriented tasks. We use the term "goal-oriented" when
the goal is clear, but this can be achieved in different ways, which cannot be
uniquely determined. We performed a simulation in which an agent observed the
data generated from a probability distribution in a two-dimensional space and
successively estimated the central coordinates of that probability
distribution. The agent has a model of probability distribution as a hypothesis
for data-generating distribution and can modify the model such that each time a
data point is observed, thereby increasing the estimated probability of
occurrence of the observed data. To achieve this, the center coordinates of the
model must be close to those of the observed data. However, in the case of a
two-dimensional space, arbitrariness arises in the direction of correction of
the center; this task is goal oriented. We analyze two cases: a strategy that
allocates the amount of modification randomly in the x- and y-directions, and a
strategy that determines allocation such that movement is minimized. The
results reveal that when a random strategy is used, the frequency of occurrence
of the movement lengths shows a power-law distribution with exponent 2. When
the minimum strategy is used, the Brownian walk appears. The presence or
absence of the constraint of minimizing the amount of movement may be a factor
that causes the difference between Brownian and Levy walks.

<h3>Quantum-field multiloop calculations in critical dynamics</h3>

The quantum-field renormalization group method is one of the most efficient
and powerful tools for studying critical and scaling phenomena in interacting
many-particle systems. The multiloop Feynman diagrams underpin the specific
implementation of the renormalization group program. In recent years, multiloop
computation has had a significant breakthrough in both static and dynamic
models of critical behavior. In the paper, we focus on the state-of-the-art
computational techniques for critical dynamic diagrams and the results obtained
with their help. The generic nature of the evaluated physical observables in a
wide class of field models is manifested in the asymptotic character of
perturbation expansions. Thus, the Borel resummation of series is required to
process multiloop results. Such a procedure also enables one to take high-order
contributions into consideration properly. The paper outlines the resummation
framework in dynamic models and the circumstances in which it can be useful. An
important resummation criterion is the properties of the higher-order
asymptotics of the perturbation theory. In static theories, these properties
are determined by the method of instanton analysis. A similar approach is
applicable in critical dynamics models. We describe the calculation of these
asymptotics in dynamical models and present the results of the corresponding
resummation.

<h3>Bilayer two-orbital model of La3Ni2O7 under pressure</h3>

The newly discovered Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ reaches an
remarkable superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 80 K under a pressure
of above 14 GPa. Here we propose a minimal bilayer two-orbital model of the
high-pressure phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our model is constructed with the
Ni-3d$_{x^2-y^2}$, 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals by using Wannier downfolding of the
DFT calculations, which captures the key ingredients of the material, such as
band structure and Fermi surface topology. There are one hole pocket $\gamma$
and two electron pockets $\alpha$, $\beta$ on the Fermi surface, in which the
$\alpha$, $\beta$ pockets show mixing of two orbitals, while the $\gamma$
pocket is associated with Ni-d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. The RPA spin
susceptibility reveals a magnetic enhancement associating to the d$_{3z^2-r^2}$
state. A higher energy model with O-p orbitals is also provided for further
study.

Several unconventional superconductors show indications of zero-energy
excitations in the superconducting state consistent with the existence of a
so-called Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS). In particular, FeSe doped with S
seems to acquire a nonzero density of states at zero energy at low temperatures
when doped into the tetragonal phase, consistent with a previously proposed
phenomenological theory assuming an anisotropic spin singlet pairing gap
coexisting with a nonunitary interband triplet component. Here we search for a
microscopic model that can support the coexistence of singlet pairing with
other orders, including interband nonunitary triplet pairing, and discuss
several candidates that indeed stabilize ground states with Bogoliubov Fermi
surfaces. We show that with proper choice of the coupling strength of the
various orders in our model, spontaneous breaking of $C_4$ rotational symmetry
is realized at low temperatures, in accordance with recent angle-resolved
photoemission experiments in Fe(Se,S) in the tetragonal phase.

As the design of single-component battery electrodes has matured, the battery
industry has turned to hybrid electrodes with blends of two or more active
materials to enhance battery performance. Leveraging the best properties of
each material while mitigating their drawbacks, multi-component hybrid
electrodes open a vast new design space that could be most efficiently explored
through simulations. In this article, we introduce a mathematical modeling
framework and open-source battery simulation software package for Hybrid
Multiphase Porous Electrode Theory (Hybrid-MPET), capable of accounting for the
parallel reactions, phase transformations and multiscale heterogeneities in
hybrid porous electrodes. Hybrid-MPET models can simulate both solid solution
and multiphase active materials in hybrid electrodes at intra-particle and
inter-particle scales. Its modular design also allows the combination of
different active materials at any capacity fraction. To illustrate the novel
features of Hybrid-MPET, we present experimentally validated models of
silicon-graphite (Si-Gr) anodes used in electric vehicle batteries and carbon
monofluoride (CFx) - silver vanadium oxide (SVO) cathodes used in implantable
medical device batteries. The results demonstrate the potential of Hybrid-MPET
models to accelerate the development of hybrid electrode batteries by providing
fast predictions of their performance over a wide range of design parameters
and operating protocols.

<h3>Solution to the Thomson problem for Clifford tori with an application to  Wigner crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15604" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15604</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In its original version, the Thomson problem consists of the search for the
minimum-energy configuration of a set of point-like electrons that are confined
to the surface of a two-dimensional sphere (${\cal S}^2$) that repel each other
according to Coulomb's law, in which the distance is the Euclidean distance in
the embedding space of the sphere, {\em i.e.}, $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this work, we
consider the analogous problem where the electrons are confined to an
$n$-dimensional flat Clifford torus ${\cal T}^n$ with $n = 1, 2, 3$. Since the
torus ${\cal T}^n$ can be embedded in the complex manifold $\mathbb{C}^n$, we
define the distance in the Coulomb law as the Euclidean distance in
$\mathbb{C}^n$, in analogy to what is done for the Thomson problem on the
sphere. The Thomson problem on a Clifford torus is of interest because
super-cells with the topology of Clifford torus can be used to describe
periodic systems such as Wigner crystals. In this work we numerically solve the
Thomson problem on a square Clifford torus. To illustrate the usefulness of our
approach we apply it to Wigner crystals. We demonstrate that the equilibrium
configurations we obtain for a large numbers of electrons are consistent with
the predicted structures of Wigner crystals. Finally, in the one-dimensional
case we analytically obtain the energy spectrum and the phonon dispersion law.

<br>
<br>
We investigated the electronic structure and superconducting properties of
single-crystalline LaCuSb$_2$. The resistivity, magnetization, and specific
heat measurements showed that LaCuSb$_2$ is a bulk superconductor. The observed
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation and magnetic field dependence of the Hall
resistivity can be reasonably understood assuming a slightly hole-doped Fermi
surface. Electron-phonon coupling calculation clarified the difference from the
isostructural compound LaAgSb$_2$ indicating that (i) low-frequency vibration
modes related to the interstitial layer sandwiched between the Sb-square nets
significantly contribute to the superconductivity and (ii) carriers with
sizable electron--phonon coupling distribute isotropically on the Fermi
surface. These are assumed to be the origin of higher superconducting
transition temperature compared with LaAgSb$_2$. We conclude that the
superconducting properties of LaCuSb$_2$ can be understood within the framework
of conventional phonon-mediated mechanism.

<h3>Fast Generation of Spectrally-Shaped Disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15693</a>
<br>
<i>Aaron Shih, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani</i>
<br>
<br>
Media with correlated disorder have recently garnered a lot of attention for
their unexpected transport properties. A critical first step towards
understanding their complex structure-function relationship is to devise
methods for designing structures with desired spectral features at scale. In
this work, we introduce an optimal formulation of this inverse problem by means
of the non-uniform fast Fourier transform, thus arriving at an algorithm
capable of generating systems with arbitrary spectral properties, with a
computational cost that scales $O(N \log N)$ with system size. The method is
extended to accommodate arbitrary real-space interactions, such as short-range
repulsion, to simultaneously control short- and long-range correlations. As an
example, we generate the largest-ever stealthy hyperuniform configurations in
$2d$ ($N = 10^9$) and $3d$ ($N > 10^7$). By an Ewald sphere construction we
then elucidate the link between spectral and optical properties at the
single-scattering level, and show that large, yet finite, stealthy hyperuniform
structures in $2d$ and $3d$ generically display bandgap-like features in their
transmission, thus providing a concrete example of how this method enables fine
tuning of a physical property at will. However, we also show that large $3d$
power-law hyperuniformity in particle packings leads to single-scattering
properties near-identical to those of simple hard spheres. Our approach for the
fast optimization of the spectral properties of point patterns should extend
readily beyond materials design, for instance to blue noise sampling and
texture generation in computer graphics.

<h3>Microcanonical Truncations of Observables in Quantum Chaotic Systems</h3>

<br>

We consider the properties of an observable (such as a single spin component
that squares to the identity) when expressed as a matrix in the basis of energy
eigenstates, and then truncated to a microcanonical slice of energies of
varying width. For a quantum chaotic system, we model the unitary or orthogonal
matrix that relates the spin basis to the energy basis as a random matrix
selected from the appropriate Haar measure. We find that the spectrum of
eigenvalues is given by a centered Jacobi distribution that approaches the
Wigner semicircle of a random hermitian matrix for small slices. For slices
that contain more than half the states, there is a set of eigenvalues of
exactly $\pm 1$. The transition to this qualitatively different behavior at
half size is similar to that seen in other quantities such as entanglement
entropy. Our results serve as a benchmark model for numerical calculations in
realistic physical systems.

<h3>Electrophoretic mobility of a water-in-oil droplet separately affected  by the net charge and surface charge density</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuki Uematsu, Hiroyuki Ohshima</i>
<br>
<br>
Water-in-oil emulsions and droplets exhibit completely different
physico-chemical properties compared to oil-in-water emulsions and droplets.
Thus, directly applying a standard theoretical model to water-in-oil systems
cannot describe these anomalous properties. Here, the electrophoretic mobility
of a water-in-oil droplet is analytically investigated using Debye-H\"uckel
linearization and neglecting Marangoni effect. The resulting electrophoretic
mobility is shown to be separately dependent on the net charge of the droplet
and the surface charge density at the droplet interface. Furthermore, when the
net charge is negligible, electrophoretic mobility is proportional to the
surface charge density with a negative coefficient. This indicates that the
internal electric double layer inversely contributes the electrophoresis. This
theory is applied to experimental data of water-in-oil emulsions and droplets
in the literature, and qualitative and quantitative verification of the theory
is discussed.

<h3>Unraveling the glass-like dynamic heterogeneity in ring polymer melts:  From flexible to rigid chain stiffness</h3>

Ring polymers are an intriguing class of polymers with unique physical
properties, and understanding their behavior is important for developing
accurate theoretical models. In this study, we investigate the effect of chain
stiffness and monomer density on static and dynamic behaviors of ring polymer
melts using molecular dynamics simulations. Our first focus is on the
non-Gaussian parameter of center of mass displacement as a measure of dynamic
heterogeneity, which is commonly observed in glass-forming liquids. We find
that the non-Gaussianity in the displacement distribution increases with the
monomer density and stiffness of the polymer chains, suggesting that excluded
volume interactions between centers of mass have a stronger effect on the
dynamics of ring polymers. We then analyze the relationship between the radius
of gyration and monomer density for flexible and rigid ring polymers. Our
results indicate that the relationship between the two varies with chain
stiffness, which can be attributed to the competition between repulsive forces
inside the ring and from adjacent rings. Finally, we study the dynamics of
bond-breakage virtually connected between the centers of mass of rings to
analyze the exchanges of inter-molecular networks of bonds. Our results
demonstrate that the dynamic heterogeneity of bond-breakage is coupled with the
non-Gaussianity in ring polymer melts, highlighting the importance of
bond-breaking method in determining the inter-molecular dynamics of ring
polymer melts. Overall, our study provides insights into the fundamental
mechanism of ring polymers and sheds light on the factors that govern their
dynamic behavior.

<h3>Ostwald ripening of aqueous microbubble solutions</h3>

Bubble solutions are of growing interest because of various technological
applications in surface cleaning, water treatment, and agriculture. However,
their physicochemical properties such as the stability and interfacial charge
of bubbles are not fully understood yet. In this study, the kinetics of radii
in aqueous microbubble solutions are experimentally investigated, and the
results are discussed in the context of Ostwald ripening. The obtained
distributions of bubble radii scaled by mean radius and total number were found
to be time-independent during the observation period. Image analysis of radii
kinetics revealed that the average growth and shrinkage speed of each bubble is
governed by diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening, and the kinetic coefficient
calculated using the available physicochemical constants in literature
quantitatively agrees with the experimental data. Furthermore, the cube of mean
radius and mean volume exhibit a linear time evolution in agreement with the
Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner (LSW) theory. The coefficients are slightly larger than
those predicted using the LSW theory, which can be qualitatively explained by
the effect of finite volume fraction. Finally, the slow down and pinning of
radius in the shrinkage dynamics of small microbubbles are discussed in detail.

<h3>Valley-dependent transport property of Stone--Wales and blister defects  in graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
Valleytronics, which makes use of the two valleys in graphenes, attracts much
attention and the valley filter is expected to be central component in
valleytronics. We investigate valley-dependent transport properties of the
Stone-Wales (SW) and blister defects of graphenes by density functional theory
calculations. It is found that the intervalley transition is perfectly
suppressed in some structures although the intravalley scattering occurs by the
defect states of the SW or blister defects. Using the tight-binding model, the
perfect suppression of the intervalley transition in the SW and blister defects
is explained by the sublattice symmetry between the A and B sites of the
bipartite honeycomb lattice. In addition, introducing the additional carbon
atoms to graphenes to form blister defects, the defect states appear near the
Fermi level and the energies where the resonant scattering occurs on the
$\mathrm{K}$ and $\mathrm{K}^\prime$ channel electrons split. Making use of
this splits, the valley-dependent transport property will be achieved by local
application of a gate voltage.

Rough diamond anvils (rough-DA) are introduced to intensify all occurring
processes during an in-situ study of heterogeneous compression of strongly
pre-deformed Zr in diamond anvil cell (DAC). Crystallite size and dislocation
density of Zr are getting pressure-, plastic strain tensor- and
strain-path-independent during {\alpha}-{\omega} phase transformation (PT) and
depend solely on the volume fraction of {\omega}-Zr. Rough-DA produce a steady
nanostructure in {\alpha}-Zr with lower crystallite size and larger dislocation
density than smooth-DA, leading to a two-time reduction in a minimum pressure
for {\alpha}-{\omega} PT to a record value 0.67 GPa. The kinetics of
strain-induced PT unexpectedly depends on time.

<h3>Proximity effect and Anomalous metal state in a model of mixed  metal-superconductor grains</h3>

<i>Tai Kai Ng</i>

<br>
Motivated by the discovery of the anomalous metal state in thin film systems
and suggestions that coexistence of superconducting and metallic components is
crucial to the formation of the state, we study in this paper a model of mixed
metallic and superconducting grains coupled by electron tunneling - the
metallic grains are expected to become superconducting because of proximity
effect in a mean-field treatment of the model. When quantum fluctuations in
relative phases between different grains are taken into account, we show that
the proximity effect can be destroyed and the metallic and superconducting
grains become "insulating" with respect to each other when the charging energy
between grains are strong enough and tunneling between grains are weak enough,
in analogy to superconductor-insulator transition in pure superconducting
grains or metal-insulator transition in pure metallic grains. Based on this
observation, a physical picture of how the anomalous metal state may form is
proposed. An experimental setup to test our proposed physical picture is
suggested.

<br>
<br>
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements at the oxygen (O) $K$-edge were performed to investigate the
magnetic polarization of ligand O atoms in the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) phase
of the Ir perovskite compound Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. With the onset of the WFM phase
below $T_{\rm N}\simeq240$ K, XMCD signals corresponding to XAS peaks
respectively identified as originating from the magnetic moments of apical and
planar oxygen (O$_{\rm A}$ and O$_{\rm P}$) in the IrO$_6$ octahedra were
observed. The observation of magnetic moments at O$_{\rm A}$ sites is
consistent (except for the relative orientation) with that suggested by prior
muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) experiment in the non-collinear antiferromagnetic
(NC-AFM) phase below $T_{\rm M}\approx100$ K. Assuming that the O$_{\rm A}$
magnetic moment observed by $\mu$SR is also responsible for the corresponding
XMCD signal, the magnetic moment of O$_{\rm P}$ is estimated to be consistent
with the previous $\mu$SR result. Since the O$_{\rm A}$ XMCD signal is mainly
contributed by Ir 5$d$ $zx$ and $yz$ orbitals which also hybridize with O$_{\rm
P}$, it is inferred that the relatively large O$_{\rm P}$ magnetic moment is
induced by Ir 5$d$ $xy$ orbitals. Moreover, the inversion of O$_{\rm A}$
moments relative to Ir moments between the two magnetic phases revealed by XMCD
suggests the presence of competing magnetic interactions for O$_{\rm A}$, with
which the ordering of O$_{\rm A}$ moments in the NC-AFM phase may be suppressed
to $T_{\rm M}$.

The versatile range of applications for two-dimensional (2D) materials has
encouraged scientists to further engineer the properties of these materials.
This is often accomplished by stacking layered materials into more complex van
der Waals heterostructures. A much less popular but technologically promising
approach is the alloying of 2D materials with different element compositions.
In this work, we demonstrate a first step in manipulating the hBN bandgap in
terms of its width and indirect/direct character of the optical transitions. We
present a set of aluminum alloyed hexagonal boron nitride (hBAlN) samples that
were grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on 2-inch sapphire
substrates with different aluminum concentration. Importantly, the obtained
samples revealed a sp$^2$-bonded crystal structure. Optical absorption
experiments disclosed two strong peaks in the excitonic spectral range with
absorption coefficient $\alpha \sim 10^6$ cm$^{-1}$. Their energies correspond
very well with the energies of indirect and direct bandgap transitions in hBN.
However, they are slightly redshifted. This observation is in agreement with
predictions that alloying with Al leads to a decrease of the bandgap energy.
The observation of two absorption peaks can be explained in terms of mixing
electronic states in the K and M conduction band valleys, which leads to a
significant enhancement of the absorption coefficient for indirect transitions.

Lasers with injected spin-polarized carriers show an outstanding performance
in both static and dynamic operation. In addition to the intensity response of
conventional lasers, without spin-polarized carriers, both intensity and
polarization of light can be exploited for optical communication in
spin-lasers. However, the polarization dynamics of spin-lasers under amplitude
modulation has been largely overlooked. Here we reveal, analytically and
numerically, a nontrivial polarization response that accompanies the well-known
intensity dynamics of a spin-laser under amplitude modulation. We evaluate the
polarization and intensity response under the same amplitude modulation, and
further assess the capability of such a polarization response in digital data
transfer with eye diagram simulations. Our results provide a more complete
understanding of the modulation response in spin-lasers and open up unexplored
opportunities in optical communication and spintronics.

Schwinger boson mean field theory is a powerful approach to study frustrated
magnetic systems which allows to distinguish long range magnetic orders from
quantum spin liquid phases, where quantum fluctuations remain strong up to zero
temperature. In this work, we use this framework to study the Heisenberg model
on the Kagome lattice with up to third nearest neighbour interaction and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) antisymmetric exchange. This model has been argued
to be relevant for the description of transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers
in certain parameter regimes, where spin liquids could be realized. By means of
the projective symmetry group classification of possible ans\"atze, we study
the effect of the DM interaction at first nearest neighbor and then compute the
$J_2$-$J_3$ phase diagram at different DM angles. We find a new phase
displaying chiral spin liquid characteristics up to spin $S=0.5$, indicating an
exceptional stability of the state.

of a linear backbone with two branching points at both ends, with
functionalities $f_1$ and $f_2$. Here, the main attention is concentrated on
studying the impact of the central backbone length on the configurational
characteristics of complex molecule, such as size and shape ratios. We apply
both a direct polymer renormalization scheme based on continuous chain model
and the alternative Wei's method to analyze a set of size and shape properties
of pom-pom polymers in dilute solution. The size ratio of a pom-pom and a chain
polymer of the same total molecular mass is calculated with an excluded volume
interaction taken into account, and estimates for asphericity are found in
Gaussian approximation, whereas for the size ratio we found a monotonous
dependence of the length of backbone at different functionalities of side arms.
Results for asphericity show a non-trivial behaviour.

the random anisotropy $D/\left|J\right|$. The phase boundary between two

Determining the low-energy eigenspectra of quantum many-body systems is a
long-standing challenge in physics. In this work, we solve this problem by
introducing two novel algorithms to determine low-energy eigenstates based on a
compact matrix product state (MPS) representation of the multiple targeted
eigenstates. The first algorithm utilizes a canonicalization approach that
takes advantage of the imaginary-time evolution of multi-target MPS, offering
faster convergence and ease of implementation. The second algorithm employs a
variational approach that optimizes local tensors on the Grassmann manifold,
capable of achieving higher accuracy. These algorithms can be used
independently or combined to enhance convergence speed and accuracy. We apply
them to the transverse-field Ising model and demonstrate that the calculated
low-energy eigenspectra agree remarkably well with the exact solution.
Moreover, the eigenenergies exhibit uniform convergence in gapped phases,
suggesting that the low-energy excited eigenstates have nearly the same level
of accuracy as the ground state. Our results highlight the accuracy and
versatility of multi-target MPS-based algorithms for determining low-energy
eigenspectra and their potential applications in quantum many-body physics.

<h3>Statistical theory of individual activity coefficients of electrolytes  including multiple ionic charges</h3>

In previous work we developed a new statistical method for calculating the
individual activities of ions including the association of ions. Here we study
multi-particle electrostatic interactions connected within higher cluster
integrals and identify the ionization constants of the mass action law of
associating ion clusters. In contrast to Bjerrum and Fuoss, our concept of
association is not based on spatial criteria, but instead on the strength of
interaction measured in powers of the Bjerrum parameter ($e^2 / D_0
k_{\text{B}} T a$ ; $a$ is contact) and defined by asymptotic properties of the
cluster integrals. For ion pair formation our mass action constant is the
classical counterpart of Planck's famous hydrogenic partition function. As a
rule, the new association constants are smaller than traditional expressions,
e.g., by Fuoss and Kraus, in the interesting regions of interaction parameters

Na$_2$SO$_4$, K$_2$SO$_4$, LaCl$_3$ and a model of seawater are studied. For
several associating electrolytes and seawater, reasonable agreement with

Symmetry is a crucial factor in determining the topological properties of
materials. In nonmagnetic chiral crystals, the existence of the Kramers Weyl
fermions reveals the topological nature of the Kramers degeneracy at
time-reversal-invariant momenta (TRIMs). However, it is not clear whether Weyl
nodes can also be pinned at points of symmetry in magnetic materials where the
time-reversal is spontaneously broken. In this study, we introduce a new type
of Weyl fermions, called Heesch Weyl fermions (HWFs), which are stabilized and
pinned at points of symmetry by the Heesch groups in inadmissible chiral
antiferromagnets. The emergence of HWFs is fundamentally different from that of
Kramers Weyl fermions, as it does not rely on any anti-unitary symmetry
$\mathcal{A}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A}^2=-1$. Importantly, the emergence of
HWFs is closely related to the antiferromagnetic order, as they are generally
obscured by nodal lines in the parent nonmagnetic state. Using group theory
analysis, we classify all the magnetic little co-groups of momenta where Heesch
Weyl nodes are enforced and pinned by symmetry. With the guidance of this
classification and first-principles calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic
(AFM) materials such as YMnO$_3$ and Mn$_3$IrGe as candidate hosts for the
AFM-order-induced HWFs.We also explore novel properties of Heesch Weyl
antiferromagnets, such as nonlinear anomalous Hall effects and axial movement
of Heesch Weyl nodes. Our findings shed new light on the role of symmetry in
determining and stabilizing topological properties in magnetic materials, and
open up new avenues for the design and exploration of topological materials.

<h3>Viscosity of flexible and semiflexible ring melts -- molecular origins  and flow-induced segregation</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate with numerical simulations the molecular origin of viscosity
in melts of flexible and semiflexible oligomer rings in comparison to
corresponding systems with linear chains. The strong increase of viscosity with
ring stiffness is linked to the formation of entangled clusters, which dissolve
under shear. This shear-induced breakup and alignment of rings in the flow
direction lead to pronounced shear-thinning and non-Newtonian behavior. In
dispersions of linear chains, the viscosity can be associated with the
(average) number of entanglements between chains, which also dissolve under
shear. While blends of flexible and semiflexible rings are mixed at rest, the
two species separate under flow. This phenomenon has potential applications in
microfluidic devices to segregate ring polymers of similar mass and chemical
composition by their bending rigidity.

<h3>Counting interacting electrons in one dimension</h3>

The calculation of the full counting statistics of the charge within a finite
interval of an interacting one-dimensional system of electrons is a
fundamental, yet as of now unresolved problem. Even in the non-interacting
case, charge counting turns out to be more difficult than anticipated because
it necessitates the calculation of a nontrivial determinant and requires
regularization. Moreover, interactions in a one-dimensional system are best
described using bosonization. However, this technique rests on a
long-wavelength approximation and is a priori inapplicable for charge counting
due to the sharp boundaries of the counting interval. To mitigate these
problems, we investigate the counting statistics using several complementary
approaches. To treat interactions, we develop a diagrammatic approach in the
fermionic basis, which makes it possible to obtain the cumulant generating
function up to arbitrary order in the interaction strength. Importantly, our
formalism preserves charge quantization in every perturbative order. We derive
an exact expression for the noise and analyze its interaction-dependent
logarithmic cutoff. We compare our fermionic formalism with the results
obtained by other methods, such as the Wigner crystal approach and numerical
calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group. Surprisingly, we
show good qualitative agreement with the Wigner crystal for weak interactions,
where the latter is in principle not expected to apply.

<br>
<br>
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown immense potential in fields
far from physics, such as in text and image generation. Here we use GANs to
learn a prototypical stochastic process on a lattice. By suitably adding noise
to the original data we succeed in bringing both the Generator and the
Discriminator loss functions close to their ideal value. However, as typical
for adversarial approaches, oscillations persist. This undermines model
selection and the quality of the generated trajectory. We demonstrate that a
suitable multi-model procedure where stochastic trajectories are advanced at
each step upon randomly selecting a Generator leads to a remarkable increase in
accuracy. Based on the reported findings GANs appears as a promising tool to
tackle complex statistical dynamics.

More than 25 years ago, unexpected metallic behavior was discovered on the
superconducting side of the superconductor-to-insulator transition. To this
day, the origin of this behavior is unclear. In this work, we present
resistance and broadband voltage noise measurements in the kilohertz regime in
amorphous indium oxide. We find that the metallic behavior gives rise to excess
noise much larger than what is expected from thermal noise with an unexpected
frequency and temperature dependence whose origin remains elusive.

Chalcogenide perovskites offer superior thermal and aqueous stability as well
as a benign elemental composition compared to organic halide perovskites for
optoelectronic applications. In this study, the structural, electrical,
elastic, phonon dispersion, and thermodynamic features of the orthorhombic
phase of chalcogenide perovskite CaZrS$_3$ (space group Pnma) were examined by
first principles calculations utilizing the plane wave pseudopotentials
(PW-PPs) in generalized gradient approximations (GGA). The ground state
properties such as lattice parameters, unit cell volume, bulk modulus, and its
derivative were calculated and are in a good agreement with existing findings.
The mechanical properties such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus
and elastic anisotropy were calculated from the obtained elastic constants. The
ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus confirms that the orthorhombic phase of
CaZrS$_3$ is a ductile material. The absence of negative frequencies in phonon
dispersion curve and the phonon density of states give an indication that the
structure is dynamically stable. Finally, thermodynamic parameters such as free
energy, entropy, and heat capacity were calculated with variation in
temperature. The estimated findings follow the same pattern as previous
efforts.

<h3>Dirac fermion spectrum of the fractional quantum Hall states</h3>

Applying a unified approach, we study the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE)
and fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in the Hofstadter model with short
range interactions between fermions. An effective field, that takes into
account the interaction between fermions, is determined by both amplitude and
phase. Its amplitude is proportional to the interaction strength, the phase
corresponds to the minimum energy. In fact, the problem is reduced to the
Harper equation with two different scales: the first is a magnetic scale with
the cell size corresponding to a unit quantum magnetic flux, the second scale
determines the inhomogeneity of the effective field, forms the steady fine
structure of the Hofstadter spectrum and leads to the realization of fractional
quantum Hall states. In a sample of finite size with open boundary conditions,
the fine structure of the Hofstadter spectrum consists of the Dirac branches of
the fermion excitations and includes the fine structure of the edge chiral
modes. The Chern numbers of the topological Hofstadter bands are conserved
during the formation of their fine structure. The edge modes are formed into
the Hofstadter bands. They connect the nearest-neighbor subbands and determine
the conductance for the fractional filling.

<br>
The model of a spherical quantum dot with several donor impurities on its
surface is suggested. The electron energy spectra are studied as a function of
the quantum dot radius and the number of impurities. Several cases of the
location of impurities on the quantum dot surface are considered. The plane
wave functions method has been applied to calculate the electron energy
spectrum. The splitting of electron energy levels is analyzed in the cases of
different number of impurities. It is shown that the electron energy splitting
depends on both the number of impurities on the surface and on their location.
The electron binding energy is defined too.

A quantum theory of spectral parameters and oscillator strengths of quantum
transitions in an active region, which contains cascades of wide quantum wells
with a complicated potential profile is developed. A new spatial design of the
cascade is calculated and proposed with such an asymmetric arrangement of the
wells and barriers, in which, without an applied electric bias, the magnitudes
of oscillator strengths are considerable and one-way resonant-tunneling
transport of electrons is observed. As a result, it becomes possible to ensure
a successful functioning of the broadband photodetector in the far IR range.

<h3>Development of a new force field for the family of primary aliphatic  amines using the three steps systematic parameterization procedure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15968" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15968</a>
<br>
<i>H. Espinosa-Jiménez, A. B. Salazar-Arriaga, H. Dominguez</i>
<br>
<br>
The applicability of the three steps systematic parametrization procedure
(3SSPP) to develop a force field for primary amines was evaluated in the
present work. Previous simulations of primary amines show that current force
fields (FF) can underestimate some experimental values under room conditions.
Therefore, we propose a new set of parameters, for an united atom (UA) model,
that can be used for short and long amines which predict correctly
thermodynamic and dynamical properties. Following the 3SSPP methodology, the
partial charges are chosen to match the experimental dielectric constant
whereas the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters, $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$, are fitted
to reproduce the surface tension at the vapor-liquid interface and the liquid
density, respectively. Simulations were initially conducted for the propylamine
molecule by introducing three different types of carbon atoms, C$_\alpha$ and
C$_\beta$, with electric charges, and C$_n$, without charge. Then, modifying
the charges of the carbons and using the transferable LJ parameters, the new
set of constants for long amines were found. The results show good agreement
for the experimental dielectric constant and mass density with a percentage
error less than 1%, whereas for the surface tension the error is up to 4%. For
the short amines, methylamine and ethylamine, the new charges were obtained
from a fitting function calculated from the long amines results. For these
molecules, the values of the dielectric constant and the surface tension
present errors of the order of 10% with the experimental data. Miscibility of
the amines was also tested with the new parameters and the results show
reasonable agreement with experiments.

Using DFT-based first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the tuning of
the electronic structure of Weyl semimetal SrSi$_{2}$ via external uniaxial
strain. The uniaxial strain facilitates the opening of bandgap along $\Gamma$-X
direction and subsequent band inversion between Si $p$ and Sr $d$ orbitals.
Z$_{2}$ invariants and surface states reveal conclusively that SrSi$_{2}$ under
uniaxial strain is a strong topological insulator. Hence, uniaxial strain
drives the semimetallic SrSi$_{2}$ into fully gapped topological insulating
state depicting a semimetal to topological insulator phase transition. Our
results highlight the suitability of uniaxial strain to gain control over the
topological phase transitions and topological states in SrSi$_{2}$.

Magnetic skyrmions in thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are
promising candidates for magnetic memory and logic devices, making the
development of ways to transport skyrmions efficiently and precisely of
significant interest. Here, we investigate the transport of skyrmions by
surface acoustic waves (SAWs) via several modalities using micromagnetic
simulations. We show skyrmion pinning sites created by standing SAWs at
anti-nodes and skyrmion Hall-like motion without pinning driven by travelling
SAWs. We also show how orthogonal SAWs formed by combining a longitudinal
travelling SAW and a transverse standing SAW can be used for the precise 2D
positioning of skyrmions. Our results also suggest SAWs offer a viable approach
to the precise transport of multiple skyrmions along multichannel racetrack.

General relativity predicts that the curvature of spacetime induces spin
rotations on a parallel transported particle. We deploy Unruh's analogue
gravity picture and consider a quantised vortex embedded in a two-dimensional
superfluid Bose--Einstein condensate. We show that such a vortex behaves
dynamically like a charged particle with a spin in a gravitational field. The
existence of a vortex spin in a superfluid complements Onsager's prediction of
the quantisation of circulation, and is suggestive of potential quantum
technology applications of rotating superfluids.

<h3>Experimental Evidence for Defect Tolerance in Pb-Halide Perovskites</h3>

<br>
<br>
The term defect tolerance (DT) is used often to rationalize the exceptional
optoelectronic properties of Halide Perovskites, HaPs, and their devices. Even
though DT lacked direct experimental evidence, it became fact in the field. DT
in semiconductors implies tolerance to structural defects without the
electrical and optical effects (e.g., traps), associated with such defects. We
present first direct experimental evidence for DT in Pb HaPs by comparing the
structural quality of 2D, 2D_3D, and 3D Pb HaP crystals with their
optoelectronic characteristics using high sensitivity methods. Importantly, we
get information from the material bulk, because we sample at least a few 100
nm, up to several micrometer, from the sample surface, which allows assessing
intrinsic bulk (and not only surface) properties of HaPs. The results point to
DT in 3D, to a lesser extent in 2D_3D, but not in 2D Pb HaPs. We ascribe such
dimension dependent DT to the higher number of (near)neighboring species,
available to compensate for structural defect effects in the 3D than in the 2D
HaP crystals. Overall, our data provide an experimental basis to rationalize DT
in Pb HaPs. These experiments and findings can guide the search for, and design
of other materials with DT.

<h3>Nonlinear spin dynamics of ferromagnetic ring in the vortex state and  its application for spin-transfer nano-oscillator</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a nonlinear spin dynamics of a ferromagnetic ring in a vortex state
induced by the spin-polarized current. We also suggest to use the ferromagnetic
ring as a free layer of a coreless vortex spin-transfer nano-oscillator. The
calculated working frequency is about several GHz, that is much higher than the
gyromode frequency of the disk-based vortex oscillator. The response of the
vortex-state ring to the spin-polarized current has hysteretic behavior with
the reasonable values of the thresholds current densities: ignition threshold
is about $10^{8} \text{A}\text{cm}^{-2}$, and elimination current to maintain
the oscillations has much lower values about $10^{6} \text{A} \text{cm}^{-2}$.
The output signal can be extracted by the help of the inverse spin Hall effect
or by the giant magnetoresistance. The output electromotive force averaged over
all sample vanishes, and we suggest to use a ferromagnetic ring or disk in a
vortex state as a GMR analyzer. For an inverse spin Hall analyser we advise to
use two heavy metals with different signs of Spin-Hall angle. The ring-based
STNO is supposed to increase the areas of practical application of the STNOs.

the thermodynamic geometry in the Ruppeiner formalism to study the geometrical
aspects of the multicritical phase diagrams for the spin-1 Blume-Emery-

the thermodynamic curvature or Ricci scalar (R) and analyzed its temperature
and crystal field behaviours near interesting critical and multicritical
points. Our findings are presented as geometrical phase diagrams including
critical and multicritical topology. From these diagrams, new vanishing
curvature lines (R = 0) extending into the ferromagnetic or paramagnetic phases
beyond the critical points and zero point temperature are observed.

Photogalvanic effect (PGE) occurs in materials with non-centrosymmetric
structures when irradiated by linearly or circularly polarized light. Here,
using non-equilibrium Green's function combined with density functional theory
(NEGF-DFT), we investigated the linear photogalvanic effect (LPGE) in
monolayers of group-V elements (As, Sb, and Bi) by first-principles
calculations. First, by designing a two-probe structure based on the group-V
elements, we found a giant anisotropy photoresponse of As between the armchair
and zigzag directions. Then, we analyzed Sb and Bi's charge and spin
photocurrent characteristics when considering the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
effect. It is found that when the polarization direction of linearly polarized
light is parallel or perpendicular to the transport direction ($\theta$ = $0^
\circ$ or $90^ \circ$), the spin up and spin down photoresponse in the armchair
direction has the same magnitude and direction, leading to the generation of
net charge current. However, in the zigzag direction, the spin up and spin down
photoresponse have the same magnitude with opposite directions, leading to the
generation of pure spin current. Furthermore, it is understood by analyzing the
bulk spin photovoltaic (BSPV) coefficient from the symmetry point of view.
Finally, we found that the net charge current generated in the armchair
direction and the pure spin current generated in the zigzag direction can be
further tuned with the increase of the material's buckling height $|h|$. Our
results highlight that these group-V monolayers are promising candidates for
novel functional materials, which will provide a broad prospect for the
realization of ultrathin ferroelectric devices in optoelectronics due to their
spontaneous polarization characteristics and high Curie temperature.

A new material characterization technique is emerging for the transmission
electron microscope (TEM). Using electron energy-loss spectroscopy, real space
mappings of the underlying electronic transitions in the sample, so called
orbital maps, can be produced. Thus, unprecedented insight into the electronic
orbitals responsible for most of the electrical, magnetic and optical
properties of bulk materials can be gained. However, the incredibly demanding
requirements on spatial as well as spectral resolution paired with the low
signal-to-noise ratio severely limits the day-to-day use of this new technique.
With the use of simulations, we strive to alleviate these challenges as much as
possible by identifying optimal experimental parameters. In this manner, we
investigate representative examples of a transition metal oxide, a material
consisting entirely of light elements, and an interface between two different
materials to find and compare acceptable ranges for sample thickness,
acceleration voltage and electron dose for a scanning probe as well as for
parallel illumination.

The parquet equation is an exact field-theoretic equation known since the 60s
that underlies numerous approximations to solve strongly correlated Fermion
systems. Its derivation previously relied on combinatorial arguments
classifying all diagrams of the two-particle Green's function in terms of their
(ir)reducibility properties. In this work we provide a derivation of the
parquet equation solely employing techniques of functional analysis namely
functional Legendre transformations and functional derivatives. The advantage
of a derivation in terms of a straightforward calculation is twofold: (i) the
quantities appearing in the calculation have a clear mathematical definition
and interpretation as derivatives of the Luttinger--Ward functional; (ii)
analogous calculations to the ones that lead to the parquet equation may be
performed for higher-order Green's functions potentially leading to a
classification of these in terms of their (ir)reducible components.

Hydrogen as a fuel plays a crucial role in driving the transition to net zero
greenhouse gas emissions. To realise its potential, obtaining a means of
efficient storage is paramount. One solution is using metal hydrides, owing to
their good thermodynamical absorption properties and effective hydrogen
storage. Although metal hydrides appear simple compared to many other energy
materials, understanding the electronic structure and chemical environment of
hydrogen within them remains a key challenge. This work presents a new
analytical pathway to explore these aspects in technologically relevant systems
using Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES) on thin films of two
prototypical metal dihydrides: YH$_{2-\delta}$ and TiH$_{2-\delta}$. By taking
advantage of the tunability of synchrotron radiation, a non-destructive depth
profile of the chemical states is obtained using core level spectra. Combining
experimental valence band spectra collected at varying photon energies with
theoretical insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a
description of the bonding nature and the role of d versus sp contributions to
states near the Fermi energy are provided. Moreover, a reliable determination
of the enthalpy of formation is proposed by using experimental values of the
energy position of metal s band features close to the Fermi energy in the
HAXPES valence band spectra.

In average atom (AA) model, the entropy provides a route to compute thermal
electronic contributions to the equation of state (EOS). The complete EOS
comprises in many modelings an additional 0K-isotherm and a thermal ionic part.
Even at low temperature, the AA model is believed to be the best practical
approach. However, when it comes to determine the thermal electronic EOS at low
temperatures, the numerical implementation of AA models faces convergence
issues related to the pressure ionization of bound states. At contrast, the
Sommerfeld expansion tells us that the variations with temperature of
thermodynamic variables should express in simple terms at these low
temperatures. This led us to tackle the AA predictions with respect to the
Sommerfeld expansion of the electronic entropy. We performed a comprehensive
investigation for various chemical elements belonging to $s-$, $p-$, $d-$, and
$f-$blocks of the periodic table, at varying densities. This was realized using
an Inferno-like model since this approach provides the best theoretical
framework to address these issues. Practical prescriptions are provided as
functions of the atomic number.

The weak ferromagnet FeBO$_3$ is well known for being a unique system for
modelling and testing magnetic dynamics primarily due to relatively simple and
localized magnetic structure and its interesting spin wave dynamics. At room
temperature, it has slightly canted iron moments lying in the a-b plane that
result in a strong antiferromagnetic moment and a weak ferromagnetic moment,
which results in pronounced ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin modes.
However, some previous studies have shown unusual low-temperature behavior that
suggests a phase transition. By performing low-temperature magnetization
measurements, both in bulk and on the mesoscale, we have observed a low
temperature magnetic texture in this material in which a large c-axis
magnetization occurs. Magnetic fields along the c-axis as high as 1300 Oe were
observed close to the sample surface. This presents evidence for the onset of a
Morin transition or another type of spin-reorientation phase transition wherein
the Fe3+ moments would acquire a c-axis component to their canting below a
critical temperature. The observation of this c-axis magnetization suggests
that there is a different ground state in this material than has been
previously expected and could be due to as yet unexplored intricacies of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

<h3>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in strongly spin-orbit-coupled  systems: General formula and application to topological and Rashba materials</h3>

We theoretically study the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) mediated
by band electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We first derive a
general formula for the coefficient ${\bm D}_i$ of the DMI in free energy in
terms of Green's functions, and examine its variations in relation to physical
quantities. In general, the DMI coefficient can vary depending on physical
quantities, i.e., whether one is looking at equilibrium spin structure (${\bm
D}_i$) or spin-wave dispersion (${\bm D}_i^{(2)}$), and the obtained formula
helps to elucidate their relations. By explicit evaluations for a magnetic
topological insulator and a Rashba ferromagnet with perpendicular
magnetization, we observe ${\bm D}_i^{(2)} \ne {\bm D}_i$ in general. In the
latter model, or more generally, when the magnetization and the spin-orbit
field are mutually orthogonal, ${\bm D}_i$ is exactly related to the
equilibrium spin current for arbitrary strength of SOC, generalizing the
similar relation for systems with weak SOC. Among various systems with strong
SOC, magnetic Weyl semimetals are special in that ${\bm D}_i^{(2)} = {\bm
D}_i$, and in fact, the DMI in this system arises as the chiral anomaly.

<br>
<br>
We present a detailed investigation of the stoichiometric CeRh$_4$Al$_{15}$
single crystal compound using the temperature dependence of the heat capacity
[$C_{\text{P}}$($T$)], electrical resistivity [$\rho$($T$)], magnetic
susceptibility [$\chi$($T$)], and magnetization [$M$($H$)] measurements for a
magnetic field ($H$) applied in the basal plane and along the $c$-axis. The low
temperature power-law behavior of $C$/$T$ $\propto$ $\chi$ $\propto$
$T^{-1+\alpha}$, the isotherm magnetization, $M \sim H^{\alpha}$ with the
exponent $\alpha$ = 0.45 - 0.55, and the $T$-linear resistivity $\Delta \rho$
$\sim$ $T^\epsilon$ with $\epsilon \sim$ 1 are found to be consistent with the
formation of quantum Griffiths singularities in the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)
regime. We further investigated the spin dynamics of a polycrystalline sample
of CeRh$_4$Al$_{15}$, using zero-field (ZF) and longitudinal-field (LF) muon
spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. ZF-$\mu$SR measurements do not reveal
any sign of long-range magnetic ordering down to 70~mK. The electronic
relaxation rate ($\lambda$) below 0.5~K increases rapidly and shows a thermal
activation-like characteristic [$T$log($\lambda$)$\sim$ $T$] over the entire
measured temperature range between 70~mK to 4~K, indicating the presence of low
energy spin fluctuations in CeRh$_4$Al$_{15}$. LF-$\mu$SR measurements show a
time-field ($t/H^{\eta}$) scaling of the $\mu$SR asymmetry indicating a quantum
critical behavior of this compound. Furthermore, inelastic neutron scattering
study on the polycrystalline sample reveals two crystal field excitations near
19 and 33~meV. These features collectively provide strong evidence of NFL
behavior in CeRh$_4$Al$_{15}$ due to the formation of Griffiths phase close to
a $T$ $\rightarrow$ 0~K quantum critical point.

Light-matter coupling in a planar optical cavity substantially modifies the
transport regimes in the system in presence of a short range excitonic
disorder. Basing on Master equation for a resonantly coupled exciton-photon
system, and treating disorder scattering in the Born-Markov approximation we
demonstrate the onset of ballistic and diffusive transport regimes in the
limits of weak and strong disorder respectively. We show that transport
parameters governing the crossover between these two regimes strongly depend on
the parameters characterizing light-matter coupling, in particular Rabi energy
and detuning between excitonic and photonic modes. The presented theory agrees
with recent experimental data on transport in disordered organic microcavities.

The Fermi sea topology is characterized by the Euler characteristics
$\chi_F$. In this Letter, we examine how $\chi_F$ of the metallic state is
inhereted by the topological invariant of the superconducting state. We
establish a correspondence between the Euler characteristic and the Chern
number $C$ of $p$-wave topological superconductors without time-reversal
symmetry in two dimensions. By rewriting the pairing potential $\Delta_{\bf
k}=\Delta_1-i\Delta_2$ as a vector field ${\bf u}=(\Delta_1,\Delta_2)$, we
found that $\chi_F=C$ when ${\bf u}$ and fermion velocity ${\bf v}$ can be
smoothly deformed to be parallel or antiparallel on each Fermi surface. We also
discuss a similar correspondence between Euler characteristic and 3D winding
number of time-reversal-invariant $p$-wave topological superconductors in three
dimensions.

<h3>Energetic perspective on emergent inductance exhibited by magnetic  textures in the pinned regime</h3>

Spatially varying magnetic textures can exhibit electric-current-induced
dynamics as a result of the spin-transfer torque effect. When such a magnetic
system is electrically driven, an electric field is generated, which is called
the emergent electric field. In particular, when magnetic-texture dynamics are
induced under the application of an AC electric current, the emergent electric
field also appears in an AC manner, notably, with an out-of-phase time profile,
thus exhibiting inductor behaviour, often called an emergent inductor. Here we
show that the emergent inductance exhibited by magnetic textures in the pinned
regime can be explained in terms of the current-induced energy stored in the
magnetic system. We numerically find that the inductance values defined from
the emergent electric field and the current-induced magnetization-distortion
energy, respectively, are in quantitative agreement in the so-called adiabatic
limit. Our findings indicate that emergent inductors retain the basic concept
of conventional inductors; that is, the energy is stored under the application
of electric current.

<h3>A Quantum Active Particle</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Classical self-propelled or activated particles that convert energy from
their environment into directed motion have recently been studied intensely at
the macroscopic and mesoscopic colloidal scales. Here we generalize the study
of actuated motion to microscopic behavior and propose a minimal model of a
quantum-active particle that is driven by randomly displaced external fields
along paths drawn from an ensemble of non-equilibrium active trajectories. We
show that this particle exhibits characteristics of activity that is of pure
quantum origin. In particular, the mean-square displacement (MSD) exhibits a
regime that scales as $t^4$ at short times $t$, and dynamically crosses over to
a $t^3$ behavior. This transition occurs at time scales controlled by the
persistence time of the imposed activity. In principle, the motion of such a
quantum-active particle can be observed in ultra-cold atoms involving
time-dependent optical traps.

<h3>Delving into the anisotropic interlayer exchange in bilayer CrI$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bilayer CrI$_3$ attracted much attention owing to peculiar switching between
the layered ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order upon stacking
alternation. This finding pointed out the importance of the apparently small
interlayer exchange, yet, existing literature addresses only its isotropic
part. To fill this gap, we combine the density functional theory with
Hamiltonian modeling to examine the anisotropic interlayer exchange in bilayer
CrI$_3$ - Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) and the Kitaev interaction (KI). We
develop and apply a novel computational procedure that yields the off-diagonal
exchange matrix elements with $\mu$eV accuracy. Inspecting two types of bilayer
stacking, we found a weak interlayer KI and much stronger DMI between the
sublattices of monoclinic bilayer and their complete absence in rhombohedral
bilayer. We show how these anisotropic interactions depend on the interlayer
distance, stacking sequence, and the spin-orbit coupling strength and suggest
the dominant superexchange processes at play. In addition, we demonstrate that
the single-ion anisotropy largely depends on stacking, increasing by 50% from
monoclinic to rhombohedral structure. Remarkably, our findings prove that
iodines, owing to their spatially extended 5p orbitals featuring strong
spin-orbit coupling, are extremely efficient in mediating DMI across the van
der Waals gap in two-dimensional magnetic heterostructures. Given that similar
findings were previously demonstrated only in metallic multilayers where the
DMI shows a much longer range, our study gives promise that the chiral control
of spin textures can be achieved in two-dimensional semiconducting magnetic
bilayers whose ligands feature strong spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Crystallization dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in a frustrated itinerant  magnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16182</a>
<br>
<i>Kotaro Shimizu, Gia-Wei Chern</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the phase ordering kinetics of skyrmion lattice (SkL) in a
metallic magnet. The SkL can be viewed as a superposition of magnetic stripes
whose periods are determined by the quasi-nesting wave vectors of the
underlying Fermi surface. An effective magnetic Hamiltonian that describes the
electron-mediated spin-spin interaction is obtained for a two-dimensional s-d
model with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Large-scale Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
dynamics simulations based on the effective spin Hamiltonian reveal a two-stage
phase ordering of the SkL phase after a thermal quench. The initial fast
crystallization of skyrmions is followed by a slow relaxation dominated by the
annihilation dynamics of dislocations, which are topological defects of the
constituent magnetic stripe orders. The late-stage phase ordering also exhibits
a dynamical scaling symmetry. We further show that the annihilation of
dislocations follows a power-law time dependence with a logarithmic correction
that depends on magnetic fields. Implications of our results for SkL phases in
magnetic materials are also discussed.

<h3>Dissipative timescales from coarse-graining irreversibility</h3>

<br>
<i>Freddy A. Cisneros, Nikta Fakhri, Jordan M. Horowitz</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose and investigate a method for identifying timescales of dissipation
in nonequilibrium steady states modeled as discrete-state Markov jump
processes. The method is based on how the irreversibility-measured by the
statistical breaking of time-reversal symmetry-varies under temporal
coarse-graining. We observe a sigmoidal-like shape of the irreversibility as a
function of the coarse-graining time whose functional form we derive for
systems with a fast driven transition. This theoretical prediction allows us to
develop a method for estimating the dissipative time scale from time-series
data by fitting estimates of the irreversibility to our predicted functional
form. We further analyze the accuracy and statistical fluctuations of this
estimate.

<h3>Kondo screening and coherence in kagome local-moment metals: Energy  scales of heavy fermions in the presence of flat bands</h3>

<br>
<i>Christos Kourris, Matthias Vojta</i>
<br>
<br>
The formation of a heavy Fermi liquid in metals with local moments is
characterized by multiple energy and temperature scales, most prominently the
Kondo temperature and the coherence temperature, characterizing the onset of
Kondo screening and the emergence of Fermi-liquid coherence, respectively. In
the standard setting of a wide conduction band, both scales depend
exponentially on the Kondo coupling. Here we discuss how the presence of flat,
i.e., dispersionless, conduction bands modifies this situation. Focussing on
the case of the kagome Kondo-lattice model, we utilize a parton mean-field
approach to determine the Kondo temperature and the coherence temperature as
function of the conduction-band filling $n_c$, both numerically and
analytically. For $n_c$ values corresponding to the flat conduction band
located at the Fermi level, we show that the exponential is replaced by a
linear dependence for the Kondo temperature and a quadratic dependence for the
coherence temperature, while a cubic law emerges for the coherence temperature
at $n_c$ corresponding to the band edge between the flat and dispersive bands.
We discuss implications of our results for pertinent experimental data.

<br>
<br>
Spatial adiabatic passage (SAP) is a process that facilitates the transfer of
a wave packet between two localized modes that are not directly coupled, but
rather interact through an intermediate third mode. By employing a
counter-intuitive adiabatic pulse sequence, this technique achieves minimal
population in the intermediate state and high transfer efficiency. Here, we
report the implementation of SAP for transferring massive particles between
three micro-optical traps. We begin by preparing ultracold fermionic atoms in
low vibrational eigenstates of one trap and then manipulate the distance
between the three traps to execute the SAP protocol. We observe a smooth
transfer of atoms between the two outer traps, accompanied by a low population
in the central trap. We validate our findings and underscore the significance
of the counter-intuitive sequence by reversing the order of the pulse sequence.
Additionally, we investigate the influence of the tunneling rate and the time
delay between the motion of the two external tweezers on the fidelity of the
process. Our results open up new possibilities for advanced control and
manipulation schemes in optical tweezer array platforms.

<h3>Topological gap protocol based machine learning optimization of Majorana  hybrid wires</h3>

<br>
<br>
Majorana zero modes in superconductor-nanowire hybrid structures are a
promising candidate for topologically protected qubits with the potential to be
used in scalable structures. Currently, disorder in such Majorana wires is a
major challenge, as it can destroy the topological phase and thus reduce the
yield in the fabrication of Majorana devices. We study machine learning
optimization of a gate array in proximity to a grounded Majorana wire, which
allows us to reliably compensate even strong disorder. We propose a metric for
optimization that is inspired by the topological gap protocol, and which can be
implemented based on measurements of the non-local conductance through the
wire.

<h3>Distinguishing erbium dopants in Y$_2$O$_3$ by site symmetry: \textit{  ab initio} theory of two spin-photon interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16231</a>
<br>
<i>Churna Bhandari, Cüneyt Şahin, Durga Paudyal, Michael E. FlattÃ\c{opyright}</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a first-principles study of defect formation and electronic
structure of erbium (Er)-doped yttria (Y$_2$O$_3$). This is an emerging
material for spin-photon interfaces in quantum information science due to the
narrow linewidth optical emission from Er dopants at standard telecommunication
wavelengths and their potential for quantum memories. We calculate formation
energies of neutral, negatively, and positively charged Er dopants and find the
configuration to be the most stable, consistent with experiment. Of the two
substitutional sites of Er for Y, the $C_2$ and $C_{3i}$, we identify the
former (with lower site symmetry) as possessing the lowest formation energy.
The electronic properties are calculated using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
functional along with the Hubbard $U$ parameter {\color{black} and spin-orbit
coupling (SOC)}, which yields a $\sim$ 6 $\mu_B$ orbital and a $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$
spin magnetic moment, and 11 electrons in the Er $4f$ shell, confirming the
formation of charge-neutral Er$^{3+}$. This standard density functional theory
(DFT) approach underestimates the band gap of the host and lacks a
first-principles justification for $U$. To overcome these issues we performed
screened hybrid functional (HSE) calculations, including a negative $U$ for the
$4f$ orbitals, with mixing ($\alpha$) and screening ($w$) parameters. These
produced robust electronic features with slight modifications in the band gap
and the $4f$ splittings depending on the choice of tuning parameters. We also
computed the many-particle electronic excitation energies and compared them
with experimental values from photoluminescence.

We develop a theory for the stochastic thermodynamics of a probe coupled to a
fluctuating medium with spatio-temporal correlations, described by a scalar
field. For a Brownian particle dragged by a harmonic trap through a fluctuating
Gaussian field, we show that near criticality the spatially-resolved heat flux
develops an unexpected dipolar structure, with heat absorption occurring on
average in front of the particle and heat dissipation behind it. Moreover, a
perturbative calculation reveals that the dissipated power displays three
distinct dynamical regimes depending on the drag velocity.

<h3>Tuning photon-mediated interactions in a multimode cavity: from  supersolid to insulating droplets hosting phononic excitations</h3>

<br>
<i>Natalia Masalaeva, Helmut Ritsch, Farokh Mivehvar</i>
<br>
<br>
Ultracold atoms trapped in laser-generated optical lattices serve as a
versatile platform for quantum simulations. However, as these lattices are
infinitely stiff, they do not allow to emulate phonon degrees of freedom. This
restriction can be lifted in emerged optical lattices inside multimode
cavities. Motivated by recent experimental progress in multimode cavity QED, we
propose a scheme to implement and study supersolid and droplet states with
phonon-like lattice excitations by coupling a Bose gas to many longitudinal
modes of a ring cavity. The interplay between contact collisional and
tunable-range cavity-mediated interactions leads to a rich phase diagram, which
includes elastic supersolid as well as insulating droplet phases exhibiting
roton-type mode softening for a continuous range of momenta across the
superradiant phase transition. The non-trivial dynamic response of the system
to local density perturbations further proves the existence of phonon-like
modes.

We obtain the numerical ground state of a one-dimensional ladder model with
the upper and lower chains occupied by spatially-separated electrons and holes,
respectively. Under charge neutrality, we find that the excitonic bound states
are always formed, i.e., no finite regime of decoupled electron and hole plasma
exists at zero temperature. The system either behaves like a bosonic liquid or
a bosonic crystal depending on the inter-chain attractive and intra-chain
repulsive interaction strengths. We also provide the detailed excitonic phase
diagrams in the intra- and inter-chain interaction parameters, with and without
disorder.

Traditional topological materials belong to different Altland-Zirnbauer
symmetry classes (AZSCs) depending on their non-spatial symmetries. Here we
introduce the notion of hybrid symmetry class topological insulators (HSCTIs):
A fusion of two different AZSC topological insulators (TIs) such that they
occupy orthogonal Cartesian hyperplanes and their universal massive Dirac
Hamiltonian mutually anticommute. The boundaries of HSCTIs can also harbor TIs,
typically affiliated with an AZSC different from the parent ones. As such, a
fusion between planar quantum spin Hall and vertical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
insulators gives birth to a three-dimensional HSCTI, accommodating quantum
anomalous Hall insulators and quantized Hall conductivity on the top and bottom
surfaces. We extend this construction to encompass crystalline HSCTI and
topological superconductors, and beyond three dimensions. Possible
(meta)material platforms to harness HSCTIs are discussed.

We report the observation of the quantum Joule-Thomson (JT) effect in ideal
and unitary Fermi gases. We study the temperature dynamics of these systems
while they undergo an energy-per-particle conserving rarefaction. For
scale-invariant systems, whose equations of state satisfy the relation
$U\propto PV$, this rarefaction conserves the specific enthalpy, which makes it
thermodynamically equivalent to a JT throttling process. We observe JT heating
in an ideal Fermi gas, stronger at higher quantum degeneracy, a result of the
repulsive quantum-statistical `force' arising from Pauli blocking. In a unitary
Fermi gas, we observe that the JT heating is marginal in the temperature range
$0.2 \lesssim T/T_{\mathrm{F}} \lesssim 0.8 $ as the repulsive
quantum-statistical effect is lessened by the attractive interparticle
interaction.
