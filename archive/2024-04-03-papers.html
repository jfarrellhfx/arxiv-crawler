<h3>Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in pentalayer  graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02192" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02192</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ming Xie, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>We critically analyze the recently reported observation of integer (IQAHE)
and fractional (FQAHE) quantum anomalous Hall effects at zero applied magnetic
field in pentalayer graphene. Our quantitative activation and variable range
hopping transport analysis of the experimental data reveals that the observed
IQAHE and FQAHE at different fillings all have similar excitation gaps of the
order of $5-10$ K. In addition, we also find that the observed FQAHE manifests
a large hidden background contact series resistance >10 k$\Omega$ of unknown
origin whereas this contact resistance is much smaller ~500 $\Omega$ in the
observed IQAHE. Both of these findings are surprising as well as inconsistent
with the well-established phenomenology of the corresponding high-field integer
and fractional quantum Hall effects in 2D semiconductor systems.

<h3>Ground state properties of the Heisenberg-compass model on the square  lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02196" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02196</a>
<br>
</p><i>Subhankar Khatua, Griffin C. Howson, Michel J. P. Gingras, Jeffrey G. Rau</i>
<p>Compass models provide insights into the properties of Mott-insulating
materials that host bond-dependent anisotropic interactions between their
pseudospin degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the classical and
quantum ground state properties of one such model relevant to certain layered
perovskite materials akin to Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ - namely, the Heisenberg-compass
model on the square lattice. We first investigate the ground state phase
diagram of this model using classical Monte Carlo simulations. These reveal
that the low temperature classical phase diagram is divided into six different
classes of long-range ordered phases, including four phases that exhibit an
order by disorder selection and two phases that are stabilized energetically.
This model admits a special duality transformation, known as the Klein duality,
conveniently allowing to map one region of coupling parameters onto another and
constraining the phase diagram, and which we exploit in our study. From the
analysis of the zero-point energy and the free energy of the spin waves, we
find that order by quantum disorder at zero temperature and order by thermal
disorder select the same orderings as those found from classical Monte Carlo
simulations. We further investigate the quantum ground states of this model
using numerical exact diagonalization on small clusters by exploiting the
translational symmetry of the square lattice. We obtain a ground state phase
diagram bearing close resemblance to that found from the classical analysis.

<h3>Normal weak eigenstate thermalization</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02199</a>
<br>
</p><i>Patrycja Łydżba, Rafał Świętek, Marcin Mierzejewski, Marcos Rigol, Lev Vidmar</i>
<p>Eigenstate thermalization has been shown to occur for few-body observables in
a wide range of nonintegrable interacting models. For intensive observables
that are sums of local operators, because of their polynomially vanishing
Hilbert-Schmidt norm, weak eigenstate thermalization occurs in quadratic and
integrable interacting systems. Here, we unveil a novel weak eigenstate
thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models whose single-particle
sector exhibits quantum chaos (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in
integrable interacting models. In such models, we show that there are few-body
observables with a nonvanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm that are guarrantied to
exhibit a polynomially vanishing variance of the diagonal matrix elements, a
phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. For quantum-chaotic
quadratic Hamiltonians, we prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is
a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be
viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We
report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for
quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the 3D Anderson model in the
delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for
the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ and XXZ models.

<h3>Retaining Landau quasiparticles in the presence of realistic charge  fluctuations in cuprates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02200" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02200</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hiroyuki Yamase, Matias Bejas, Andres Greco</i>
<p>Charge excitation spectra are getting clear in cuprate superconductors in
momentum-energy space especially around a small momentum region, where plasmon
excitations become dominant. Here, we study whether Landau quasiparticles
survive in the presence of charge fluctuations observed in experiments. We
employ the layered t-J model with the long-range Coulomb interaction, which can
reproduce the realistic charge fluctuations. We find that Landau quasiparticles
are retained in a realistic temperature and doping region, although the
quasiparticle spectral weight is strongly reduced to 0.08-0.24.
Counterintuitively, the presence of this small quasiparticle weight does not
work favorably to generate a pseudogap.

<h3>Non-Equilibrium Oscillations Arising in Thermally Induced Convective  Systems through Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02217</a>
<br>
</p><i>José López-Molina, Arturo Moncho-Jordá, María Tirado-Miranda</i>
<p>We use Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering (HDLS) with a dual-laser beam setup
to investigate the drift velocities of colloidal particles immersed in a
solvent exposed to thermally-induced convection. Our investigation reveals the
appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the intensity
autocorrelation function, which are linked to the particle drift velocities. In
addition to this non-equilibrium oscillations, we report an enhanced decay of
the intensity correlation function attributable to the loss of correlation as
particles depart from the scattering volume due to prevailing convective flow.
A pivotal discovery of our research is the identification of a specific
temperature gradient threshold, beyond which pronounced velocity fluctuations
ensue as a consequence of the establishment of a non-stationary flow within the
measurement cell. The experimental results, obtained for different colloidal
systems, are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with
fluid dynamics simulations and Brownian dynamics simulations, yielding
excellent agreement with the experimental data, and providing a robust and
complete explanation of the observed phenomena. This study presents an insight
in the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, offering a reliable method
to study complex behaviors in convective systems through advanced HDLS
techniques and multidisciplinary simulations.

<h3>Spin and bond-charge excitation spectra in correlated electron systems  near antiferromagnetic phase</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02219</a>
<br>
</p><i>Muhammad Zafur, Hiroyuki Yamase</i>
<p>Magnetic and bond-charge interactions can arise from the same microscopic
interaction. Motivated by this observation, we compute magnetic and bond-charge
excitation spectra on an equal footing by introducing a simple effective model
on a square lattice, which describes antiferromagnetic and d-wave
superconducting phases around half-filling on the electron-doped side. The
magnetic excitation spectrum Im chi(q, omega) has strong weight around q=(pi,
pi) in low energy and its intensity map exhibits a pencil-tip-like shape in
q-omega space. Around q=(0,0) magnetic excitations show a steep dispersion
toward the (pi, pi) and (pi,0) directions, which is very similar to a spin-wave
dispersion although the system is non-magnetic. Bond-charge excitations are
characterized by four different symmetries and studied for all possible
couplings. Bond-charge fluctuations with three different symmetries have large
spectral weight around q=(pi, pi) in a relatively low-energy region and extend
widely more than the magnetic excitation spectrum. The d-wave symmetry of
bond-charge excitations also has sizable spectral weight along the direction
(pi/2, pi/2)-(0, 0)-(pi/2, 0) in a low-energy region and exhibits softening
around q approx (0.5 pi, 0), whereas no such softening is present in the other
symmetries. These results capture the essential features observed in
electron-doped cuprates and may motivate an experimental test of bond-charge
excitations around q=(pi, pi) on top of the strong magnetic excitations there
as well as additional softening in the d-wave channel in the (pi, pi)-(pi/2,
pi/2) region at low temperatures near the magnetic phase. We extend the present
analysis to the hole-doped side and highlight a contrast to the electron-doped
side, which includes incommensurate correlations, electronic nematic
correlations, and spin and bond-charge resonance modes in the superconducting
state.

<h3>Tunability of charge density wave in a magnetic kagome metal</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ji Seop Oh, Ananya Biswas, Mason Klemm, Hengxin Tan, Makoto Hashimoto, Donghui Lu, Binghai Yan, Pengcheng Dai, Robert J. Birgeneau, Ming Yi</i>
<p>The discovery of the charge density wave order (CDW) within a magnetically
ordered phase in the kagome lattice FeGe has provided a promising platform to
investigate intertwined degrees of freedom in kagome lattices. Recently, a
method based on post-annealing has been suggested to manipulate the CDW order
in kagome FeGe towards either long-range or suppressed orders. Here, we provide
a comprehensive comparison of the experimentally measured electronic structures
of FeGe crystals that have undergone different post-annealing procedures and
demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness on tuning the CDW gap without strong
perturbation on the underlying electronic structure. Moreover, we observe an
additional low temperature transition that only appears in crystals with a
long-range CDW order, which we associate with a lattice-spin coupled order. Our
work indicates a likely strong sensitivity of the CDW order to disorder in
FeGe, and provides evidence for strong coupling between the electronic,
lattice, and spin degrees of freedom in this kagome magnet.

<h3>Transmigration of Edge States with Interaction in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger  Chain</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02259</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jyoti Bisht, Somenath Jalal, Brijesh Kumar</i>
<p>The effect of Hubbard and Kondo interactions on the edge states in the
half-filled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of electrons is investigated by studying
the behaviour of charge quasiparticles using Kumar representation and density
matrix renormalization group method. For any finite dimerization of hopping, by
increasing the Hubbard interaction, the edge states are found to transmigrate
from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap through an intermediate phase
without the edge states. The extent of this phase with no edge states shrinks
smoothly upon increasing the dimerization. The transmigration of edge states
from the charge gap to the high energy gap is also found to occur with Kondo
interaction, but through an intermediate phase which itself changes from having
no edge states for weak dimerization to having the edge states in the physical
as well as the high energy gaps coexisting from moderate to strong
dimerization.

<h3>High temperature series expansions of S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin models:  algorithm to include the magnetic field with optimized complexity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02271</a>
<br>
</p><i>Laurent Pierre, Bernard Bernu, Laura Messio</i>
<p>This work presents an algorithm for calculating high temperature series
expansions (HTSE) of Heisenberg spin models with spin $S=1/2$ in the
thermodynamic limit. This algorithm accounts for the presence of a magnetic
field. The paper begins with a comprehensive introduction to HTSE and then
focuses on identifying the bottlenecks that limit the computation of higher
order coefficients. HTSE calculations involve two key steps: graph enumeration
on the lattice and trace calculations for each graph. The introduction of a
non-zero magnetic field adds complexity to the expansion because previously
irrelevant graphs must now be considered: bridged graphs. We present an
efficient method to deduce the contribution of these graphs from the
contribution of sub-graphs, that drastically reduces the time of calculation
for the last order coefficient (in practice increasing by one the order of the
series at almost no cost). Previous articles of the authors have utilized HTSE
calculations based on this algorithm, but without providing detailed
explanations. The complete algorithm is publicly available, as well as the
series on many lattice and for various interactions.

<h3>Thermoelectric Properties of Graphene through BN-ring Doping: A  Theoretical Investigation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02307" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02307</a>
<br>
</p><i>Laura Caputo, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Jean-Christophe Charlier</i>
<p>Graphene has been widely studied for various applications due to its
outstanding electrical and mechanical properties. However, its potential in
thermoelectric applications has been limited by a low Seebeck coefficient and
high thermal conductivity. Efforts to enhance its thermoelectric properties
have involved the usage of carbon-based nanoribbons, strain engineering, and
heteroatom co-doping, particularly with Nitrogen and/or Boron atoms. In this
work, multiscale simulation approaches combining DFT calculations and
semi-empirical models are used to explore the potential improvement of the
thermoelectric properties via borazine (B$_3$N$_3$)-ring doping. As bandgap
engineering can be obtained with this doping, the thermoelectric properties of
graphene are significantly enlarged, albeit at the cost of reduced conductance.
The effects observed are not only dependent on the concentration of BN within
the graphene lattice but are also notably influenced by the relative rotational
alignment of the BN rings. Furthermore, the effect of the distribution and
rotational disorder are considered, showing reduced electronic conductance
compared to the periodic case highlighting the importance of precise control
over the doping parameters of BN-ring. Lastly, the thermal lattice conductance
is estimated revealing a substantial reduction of up to 40$\%$ compared to
pristine graphene opening up the possibility of enhancing the thermoelectric
efficiency of BNC materials. The present theoretical approach highlights how
BN-ring doping can refine the thermoelectric properties of 2D graphene,
offering a pathway for enhancing its suitability in practical thermoelectric
applications.

<h3>Evolution of Berry Phase and Half-Metallicity in Cr$_2$Te$_3$ in  Response to Strain, Filling, Thickness, and Surface Termination</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02315" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02315</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sohee Kwon, Yuhang Liu, Hang Chi, Gen Yin, Mahesh R. Neupane, Roger K. Lake</i>
<p>Cr$_2$Te$_3$ is a ferromagnetic, quasi-two-dimensional layered material with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, strong spin-orbit coupling, and non-trivial
band topology. The non-trivial topology results in an intrinsic anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC) that switches sign under filling and biaxial strain. Thin
films can exhibit half metallicity. Using density functional theory combined
with maximally localized Wannier functions, we reveal the physical origins of
the sensitivity of the sign of the AHC to strain and filling, and we determine
the effect of surface termination on the half metallicity. We find that thin
films terminated on the Te layers are the most energetically stable, but only
the thin films terminated on both sides with the partially occupied Cr layers
are half metals. In bulk Cr$_2$Te$_3$, the sensitivity of the sign of the AHC
to strain and filling results from the complex Fermi surface comprised of three
bands. Filling of local minima and bands near anti-crossings alters the local
Berry curvature consistent with the negative to positive switching of the AHC.
Similarly, strain depopulates a local minimum, shifts a degenerate point closer
to the Fermi energy, and causes two spin-orbit split bands to reverse their
order. These findings provide a physical understanding of the evolution of the
Berry phase, AHC, and half-metallicity in Cr$_2$Te$_3$.

<h3>Local spin structure in the layered van der Waals materials  MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02328</a>
<br>
</p><i>Raju Baral, Amanda V. Haglund, Jue Liu, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, David Mandrus, Stuart Calder</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, whether in bulk form or reduced to
just a single layer, have potential applications in spintronics and capacity
for advanced quantum phenomena. A prerequisite for harnessing these
opportunities lies in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the spin
behavior in 2D materials. The low dimensionality motivates an understanding of
the spin correlations over a wide length scale, from local to long range order.
In this context, we focus on the magnetism in bulk \MPSe ~and \MPS, 2D layered
van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductors. These materials have similar
honeycomb Mn layers and magnetic ordering temperatures, but distinct spin
orientations and exchange interactions. We utilize neutron scattering to gain
deeper insights into the local magnetic structures and spin correlations in the
paramagnetic and ordered phases by systematically investigating a
MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$ ($x$ = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3) series of powder samples using
total neutron scattering measurements. By employing magnetic pair distribution
function (mPDF) analysis, we unraveled the short-range magnetic correlations in
these materials and explored how the non-magnetic anion S/Se mixing impacts the
magnetic correlations. The results reveal that the magnetism can be gradually
tuned through alteration of the non-magnetic S/Se content, which tunes the
atomic structure. The change in magnetic structure is also accompanied by a
control of the magnetic correlation length within the 2D honeycomb layers.
Complimentary inelastic neutron scattering measurements allowed a
quantification of the change in the magnetic exchange interactions for the
series and further highlighted the gradual evolution of spin interactions in
the series MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$.

<h3>A spectral investigation of criticality and crossover effects in two and  three dimensions: Short timescales with small systems in minute random  matrices</h3>

</p><i>Eliseu Venites Filho, Roberto da Silva, José Roberto Drugowich de Felício</i>
<p>Random matrix theory, particularly using matrices akin to the Wishart
ensemble, has proven successful in elucidating the thermodynamic
characteristics of critical behavior in spin systems across varying interaction
ranges. This paper explores the applicability of such methods in investigating
critical phenomena and the crossover to tricritical points within the
Blume-Capel model. Through an analysis of eigenvalue mean, dispersion, and
extrema statistics, we demonstrate the efficacy of these spectral techniques in
characterizing critical points in both two and three dimensions. Crucially, we
propose a significant modification to this spectral approach, which emerges as
a versatile tool for studying critical phenomena. Unlike traditional methods
that eschew diagonalization, our method excels in handling short timescales and
small system sizes, widening the scope of inquiry into critical behavior.

<p>Strain at interfaces may profoundly impact the microstructure and properties
of materials; thus, it is a major consideration when designing and engineering
materials. Dislocation formation is a commonly known mechanism to release
mismatch strain at solid-solid interfaces. However, it is still unclear about
how materials accommodate interfacial strain under drastically accelerated
structural transformation kinetics, since it is extremely challenging to
directly observe the atomic structure evolution of fast-propagating interfaces.
Utilizing liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have achieved
atomic-scale imaging of hydrogen-induced phase transformations of palladium
nanocrystals with different transformation speeds. Our observation reveals that
the fast phase transformation occurs with an expanded interface of mixed
$\alpha$- and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases, and tilting of (020) planes to
accommodate mismatch strain. In contrast, slow phase transformations lead to
sharp interfaces with slipping misfit dislocations. Our kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations show that fast phase transformation pushes the system
far-from-equilibrium, generically roughening the interface; however, a smooth
boundary minimizes strain near-equilibrium. Unveiling the atomic pathways of
transformations from near-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium, which was
previously possible only computationally, this work holds significant
implications for engineering microstructure of materials through modulating
solid-solid transformations in a wide range of kinetics.

<p>Materials with in-plane electrical anisotropy have great potential for
designing artificial synaptic devices. However, natural materials with strong
intrinsic in-plane electrical anisotropy are rare. We introduce a simple
strategy to produce extremely large electrical anisotropy via grating gating of
a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of AlGaN/GaN. We show that
periodically modulated electric potential in the 2DEG induces in-plane
electrical anisotropy, which is significantly enhanced in a magnetic field,
leading to an ultra large electrical anisotropy. This is induced by a giant
positive magnetoresistance and a giant negative magnetoresistance under two
orthogonally oriented in-plane current flows, respectively. This giant
electrical anisotropy is in-situ tunable by tailoring both the grating gate
voltage and the magnetic field. Our semiconductor device with controllable
giant electrical anisotropy will stimulate new device applications, such as
multi-terminal memtransistors and bionic synapses.

<h3>Ab initio exploration of short-pitch skyrmion materials: Role of orbital  frustration</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02428</a>
<br>
</p><i>Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita</i>
<p>In recent years, the skyrmion lattice phase with a short lattice constant has
attracted attention due to its high skyrmion density, making it a promising
option for achieving high-density storage memory and for observing novel
phenomena like the quantized topological Hall effect. Unlike conventional
non-centrosymmetric systems where the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction plays a
crucial role, the short pitch skyrmion phase requires a quadratic magnetic
interaction $J(q)$ with a peak at finite-$Q$, and weak easy-axis magnetic
anisotropy is also critical. Thus, conducting first-principles evaluations is
essential for understanding the formation mechanism as well as for promoting
the discovery of new skyrmion materials. In this {\it Perspective}, we focus on
recent developments of the first-principles evaluations of these properties and
apply them to the prototype systems Gd$T_2X_2$ and Eu$T_2X_2$, where $T$
denotes a transition metal and $X$ represents Si or Ge. In particular, based on
the spin density functional theory with the Hubbard correction combined with
the Liechtenstein method in the Wannier tight-binding model formalism, we first
show that the Hubbard $U$ and Hund's coupling is essential to stabilize a
skyrmion lattice state by enhancing the easy-axis anisotropy. We then discuss
mechanisms of finite-$Q$ instability and show that competition among Gd-5$d$
orbitals determines whether ferromagnetism or a finite-$Q$ structure is favored
in Gd$T_2$Si$_2$ with $T=$ Fe and Ru. Our systematic calculations reveal that
GdRu$_2$$X_2$, GdOs$_2$$X_2$, and GdRe$_2X_2$ are promising, while GdAg$_2X_2$,
GdAu$_2X_2$, and EuAg$_2X_2$ are possible candidates as the skyrmion host
materials. Analysis based on a spin spiral calculation for the candidate
materials is also presented.

<h3>Observation of Kosterlitz-Thouless Metal-to-Insulator Transition in  Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</h3>

<p>Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by
a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic
properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect
has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological
insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. The quantized Hall
conductance observed in this sandwich heterostructure originates from the
combined contribution of the top and bottom surface states. In this work, we
employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches
with varying thicknesses of the middle undoped TI layer. The well-quantized QAH
effect is observed in all these samples and its critical behavior is modulated
by the IEC between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau
phase transition (PPT), we find that thinner QAH samples exhibit a
two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent
longitudinal resistance, whereas thicker QAH samples behave as a
three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher
temperatures. The IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition in the QAH
PPT regime can be understood through a two-channel Chalker-Coddington network
model by tuning inter-channel tunneling. The agreement between experiment and
theory strongly supports the QAH PPT within the Kosterlitz-Thouless framework,
where the critical metal and disordered insulator phases exist in bound and
unbound states of vortex-antivortex pairs, respectively.

<p>We develop a high-throughput computational scheme based on cluster multipole
theory to identify new functional antiferromagnets. This approach is applied to
228 magnetic compounds listed in the AtomWork-Adv database, known for their
elevated N\'eel temperatures. We conduct systematic investigations of both

reveal that 34 of these compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic structures with
zero propagation vectors and magnetic symmetries identical to conventional

applications. By cross-referencing our predictions with the existing MAGNDATA
database and published literature, we verify the reliability of our findings
for 26 out of 28 compounds with partially or fully elucidated magnetic
structures in the experiments. These results not only affirm the reliability of
our scheme but also point to its potential for broader applicability in the

<h3>Universality of Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom  mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kazuki Oi, Pascal Naidon, Shimpei Endo</i>
<p>We study three-body systems in a mass-imbalanced two-component cold-atom
mixture, and investigate the three-body parameter of their Efimov states for
both bosonic and fermionic systems, with a major focus on the Er-Er-Li Efimov
states. For a system interacting solely via van der Waals interactions, the van
der Waals universality of the three-body parameter is analytically derived
using the quantum defect theory. With the addition of a perturbative dipole
interaction between the heavy atoms, the three-body parameters of the bosonic
and fermionic Efimov states are found to behave differently. When the dipole
interaction is as strong as the van der Waals interaction, corresponding to
realistic Er-Er-Li Efimov states, we show that the van der Waals universality
persists once the effects of the non-perturbative dipole interaction are
renormalized into the s-wave and p-wave scattering parameters between the heavy
atoms. For a dipole interaction much stronger than the van der Waals
interaction, we find that the universality of the Efimov states can be
alternatively characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional scattering parameter due
to a strong anisotropic deformation of the Efimov wavefunctions. Our work thus
clarifies the interplay of isotropic and anisotropic forces in the universality
of the Efimov states. Based on the renormalized van der Waals universality, the
three-body parameter is estimated for specific isotopes of Er-Li cold-atom
mixtures.

<h3>Noninteracting particles in a harmonic trap with a stochastically driven  center</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02480</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sanjib Sabhapandit, Satya N. Majumdar</i>
<p>We study a system of $N$ noninteracting particles on a line in the presence
of a harmonic trap $U(x)=\mu \bigl[x-z(t)\bigr]^2/2$, where the trap center
$z(t)$ undergoes a bounded stochastic modulation. We show that this stochastic
modulation drives the system into a nonequilibrium stationary state, where the
joint distribution of the positions of the particles is not factorizable. This
indicates strong correlations between the positions of the particles that are
not inbuilt, but rather get generated by the dynamics itself. Moreover, we show
that the stationary joint distribution can be fully characterized and has a
special conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure.
This special structure allows us to compute several observables analytically
even in such a strongly correlated system, for an arbitrary bounded drive
$z(t)$. These observables include the average density profile, the correlations
between particle positions, the order and gap statistics, as well as the full
counting statistics. We then apply our general results to two specific examples
where (i) $z(t)$ represents a dichotomous telegraphic noise, and (ii) $z(t)$
represents an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analytical predictions are
verified in numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement.

<h3>Dirac fermions collimation in heterostructures based on tilted Dirac  cone materials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ej Bouâzzaoui Choubabi, Bouchaib Lemaalem, Mohamed Raggui, Abdelhadi Belouad, Rachid Houça, Abdellatif Kamal, Mohamed Monkade</i>
<p>This paper aims to theoretically analyze the behavior of Dirac fermions in
tilted Dirac cone material, particularly those that have diffused a barrier
potential.Our results show that the degree of tilt in the y-direction can lead
to different collimations of the Dirac fermion beams relative to the Fermi and
confinement surfaces. To study the transmission probability, we exploited our
results numerically, taking into account the various configurations of the
system and the different external and internal physical parameters by
characterizing the behavior of fermionic transport in a proposed
heterostructure. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing controllable
electronic devices utilizing Dirac fermion collimation, governed by the tilt
parameter, enabling precise manipulation and enhanced functionality.

<h3>A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by  Poisson noise</h3>

</p><i>Richard E. Spinney, Richard G. Morris</i>
<p>We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the
fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing
Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A:
Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson
fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit
that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity
limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related
to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various
examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more
complicated reaction schemes.

<h3>Bacterial cell death: Atomistic simulations reveal pore formation as a  mode of action of structurally nano engineered star peptide polymers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02501" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02501</a>
<br>
</p><i>Amal Jayawardena, Andrew Hung, Greg Qiao Elnaz Hajizadeh</i>
<p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most
urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and
biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke
resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs)
are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped
polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides
with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo
experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with
arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit
sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested.
Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide
arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms
responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To
address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique
to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids,
namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on
secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as
their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a
step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs
interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death.
These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the
chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria,
therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and
development of effective antibacterial agents.

<h3>Valley-controlled photoswitching of metal-insulator nanotextures</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Hannes Böckmann, Jan Gerrit Horstmann, Felix Kurtz, Manuel Buriks, Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana, Stefan Wippermann, Claus Ropers</i>
<p>Spatial heterogeneity and phase competition are hallmarks of
strongly-correlated materials, promising tunable functionality on the
nanoscale. Light-induced switching of a correlated insulator to a metallic
state is well established. However, optical excitation generally lacks the
specificity to select sub-wavelength domains and control final textures. Here,
we employ valley-selective photodoping to drive the domain-specific quench of a
textured Peierls insulator. Polarized excitation leverages the anisotropy of
quasi-one-dimensional states at the correlated gap to initiate an
insulator-to-metal transition with minimal electronic heating. We find that
averting dissipation facilitates domain-specific carrier confinement, control
over nanotextured phases, and a prolonged lifetime of the metastable metallic
state. Complementing existing manipulation schemes, valley-selective
photoexcitation will enable the activation of electronic phase separation
beyond thermodynamic limitations, facilitating optically-controlled hidden
states, engineered heterostructures, and polarization-sensitive percolation
networks.

<h3>Nonlinear Corner States in Topologically Nontrivial Kagome Lattice</h3>

<br>
</p><i>K Prabith, Georgios Theocharis, Rajesh Chaunsali</i>
<p>We investigate a higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) under strong
nonlinearity, focusing on the existence and stability of high-amplitude corner
states, which can find applications in optics, acoustics, elastodynamics, and
other wave-based systems. Our study centers on a breathing Kagome lattice
composed of point masses and springs known to exhibit edge and corner states in
its linear regime. By introducing onsite cubic nonlinearity, we analyze its
impact on both edge and corner states. The nonlinear continuation of the corner
state unveils stable high-amplitude corner states within the lattice, featuring
non-zero displacements at even sites from the corner -- a characteristic absent
in the linear limit. Interestingly, the nonlinear continuation of the edge
state reveals its transformation into distinct families of high-amplitude
corner states via two pitchfork bifurcations. While some states maintain
stability, others become unstable through real instability and Neimark-Sacker
bifurcation. These unstable corner states dissipate their energy into the edges
and the bulk over an extended period, as corroborated by long-time dynamical
simulations. Consequently, our study provides insights into achieving
significant energy localization at the corners of HOTIs through various classes
of nonlinear states.

<h3>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of  vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ana M. Montero, Álvaro Rodríguez-Rivas, Santos B. Yuste, Andrés Santos, Mariano López de Haro</i>
<p>In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding
the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and
structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates
regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total
correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the
dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et
al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that
the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW
line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla
potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ
theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional
and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case
do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the
three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the
understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also
provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of
simple fluids.

<p>Feasibility of two-line design of Josephson traveling wave parametric
amplifier aimed at increase of the allowed pump wave energy and hence the gain

<h3>Occurrence of the collective Ziman limit of heat transport in cubic  semiconductors: scattering channels and size effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02553</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jelena Sjakste, Maxime Markov, Raja Sen, Lorenzo Paulatto, Nathalie Vast</i>
<p>In this work, we discuss the possibility of reaching the Ziman conditions for
collective heat transport in cubic bulk semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, AlAs
and AlP. In natural and enriched silicon and germanium, the collective heat
transport limit is impossible to reach due to strong isotopic scattering.
However, we show that in hyperenriched silicon and germanium, as well as in
materials with one single stable isotope like AlAs and AlP, at low
temperatures, normal scattering plays an important role, making the observation
of the collective heat transport possible. We further discuss the effects of
sample sizes, and analyse our results for cubic materials by comparing them to
bulk bismuth, in which second sound has been detected at cryogenic
temperatures. We find that collective heat transport in cubic semiconductors
studied in this work is expected to occur at temperatures between 10 and 20 K.

<h3>Crystallographic dependence of Field Evaporation Energy Barrier in  metals using Field Evaporation Energy Loss Spectroscopy mapping</h3>

<p>Atom probe tomography data is composed of a list of coordinates of the
reconstructed atoms in the probed volume. The elemental identity of each atom
is derived from time-of-flight mass spectrometry, with no local energetic or
chemical information readily available within the mass spectrum. Here, we used
a new data processing technique referred to as field evaporation energy loss
spectroscopy (FEELS), which analyses the tails of mass peaks. FEELS was used to
extract critical energetic parameters that characterize the field evaporation
process, which are related to the binding energy of atoms to the surface under
intense electrostatic field and dependent of the path followed by the departing
atoms during the field evaporation process. We focused our study on different
pure face centered cubic metals (Al, Ni, Rh). We demonstrate that the energetic
parameters extracted from mass spectra can be mapped in 2D with nanometric
resolution. A dependence on the considered crystallographic planes is observed,
with sets of planes of low Miller indices showing a lower sensitivity to the
intensity of the electric field, which indicates a lower effective attachment
energy. The temperature is also an important parameter in particular for Al,
which we attribute to an energetic transition between two paths of field
evaporation between 25K and 60K close to (002) pole at the specimen's surface.
This paper shows that the complex information that can be retrieved from the
measured energy loss of surface atoms is important both instrumentally and
fundamentally.

<h3>Effect of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in minimum  vertex cover problem</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Aki Dote, Koji Hukushima</i>
<p>The effects of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in the
Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs are
investigated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Following our previous
work that revealed the reduction of the critical temperature by constraint
relaxation based on the penalty function method, this study focuses on
investigating the critical properties of the relaxation time along its phase
boundary. It is found that the dynamical correlation function of MVC with
respect to the problem size and the constraint strength follows a universal
scaling function. The analysis shows that the relaxation time decreases as the
constraints are relaxed. This decrease is more pronounced for the critical
amplitude than for the critical exponent, and this result is interpreted in
terms of the system's microscopic energy barriers due to the constraint
relaxation.

<p>Since the implementation of the Materials Genome Project by the Obama
administration in the United States, the development of various computational
materials databases has fundamentally expanded the choices of industries such
as materials and energy. In the field of thermoelectric materials, the
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT quantifies the performance of the material.
From the viewpoint of calculations for vast materials, the ZT values are not
easily obtained due to their computational complexity. Here, we show how to
build a database of thermoelectric materials based on first-principles
calculations for the electronic and heat transport of materials. Firstly, the
initial structures are classified according to the values of bandgap and other
basic properties using the clustering algorithm K-means in machine learning,
and high-throughput first principles calculations are carried out for
narrow-bandgap semiconductors which exhibiting potential thermoelectric
application. The present framework of calculations mainly includes deformation
potential module, electrical transport performance module, mechanical and
thermodynamic properties module. We have also set up a search webpage for the
calculated database of thermoelectric materials, providing searching and
viewing the related physical properties of materials. Our work may inspire the
construction of more computational databases of first-principle thermoelectric
materials and accelerate research progress in the field of thermoelectrics.

<h3>Impact of Monoatomic Vacancies in 2D Materials on the Performance of  Magnetic Tunnel Junction Devices: Insights from Configurations and Interface  Interactions</h3>

</p><i>Halimah Harfah, Yusuf Wicaksono, Gagus K. Sunnardianto, Muhammad Aziz Majidi, Koichi Kusakabe</i>
<p>We investigate the impact of monoatomic vacancies in 2D materials on the
performance of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices using first-principles
calculations within Density Functional Theory (DFT). Specifically, we analyze
the influence on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with various layer
configurations, uncovering distinct transmission probability patterns.
Transmission calculations were conducted using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formula
employing the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method. In the
Ni/hBN(V$_B$)-hBN/Ni system, a significant reduction in transmission
probability was observed compared to non-vacancy configurations. However, when
two hBN vacancies were considered, creating the Ni/hBN(V$_B$)-hBN(V$_B$)/Ni MTJ
system, a new transmission channel mediated by vacancy localized states
emerged. The introduction of a monoatomic boron vacancy in the middle hBN layer
of the Ni/3hBN/Ni system revealed nuanced effects on the transmission
probability, highlighting alterations in the spin minority and majority
channels. Additionally, we explore the monoatomic vacancy in the graphene layer
in the Ni/hBN-Gr-hBN/Ni MTJ, uncovering a unique transmission channel
influenced by the proximity effect. Our findings suggest that the creation of
monoatomic vacancies on the insulator barrier of 2D materials induces
distinctive characteristics shaped by the interaction between the surface state
of the electrode and the localized state of the monoatomic vacancy layer in the
MTJ system.

<h3>Enhancement of Magnon Transport by Superconductor Meissner Screening</h3>

</p><i>Xi-Han Zhou, Xiyin Ye, Lihui Bai, Tao Yu</i>
<p>Recent experiments observe the spin-wave-Meissner-current modes in
ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor heterostructures, in which the
coherently excited spin waves seemingly do not decay as usual beneath the
superconductor strip [Borst et al., Science 382, 430 (2023)]. We interpret this
phenomenon by demonstrating that the stray magnetic field emitted by the
magnetization dynamics is reflected, focused, and enhanced inside the
ferromagnet by the supercurrent induced in the superconductor, such that the
group velocity of spin waves is strongly enhanced. Analytical and numerical
calculations based on this model predict that the coherent transport of magnons
is enhanced by close to 500% for yttrium iron garnet capped by superconducting
NbN with a decay length exceeding millimeters. Our finding may augment the
performance of magnons in quantum information and quantum transport processing.

<p>We present the development of a quadratic Spectral Neighbor Analysis
Potential (q-SNAP) for ferromagnetic cobalt and its applications to bulk
phases, surfaces, and nanoparticles. Trained on Density Functional Theory
calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (DFT-PBE) functional, this
machine-learned potential enables simulations of large systems over extended
time scales across a wide range of temperatures and pressures at near DFT
accuracy. It is validated by closely reproducing the phonon dispersions of
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Co, surface
energies, and the relative stability of nanoparticles of various shapes.
Thermal expansion and the melting point of Co computed with this potential are
close to experimental values. Furthermore, this machine-learned potential goes
beyond the capabilities of simpler N-body potentials by capturing nuanced
properties such as vacancy formation energies on nanoparticle vertices. This
accuracy and versatility make the potential suitable for a wide range of
applications, including catalysis.

<h3>Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Taiki Matsushita, Takeshi Mizushima, Yusuke Masaki, Satoshi Fujimoto, Ilya Vekhter</i>
<p>Superconducting spintronics focuses on the interplay between
superconductivity and magnetism and has sparked significant interest in
nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting
phenomena. However, a direct test for nonunitary superconductors is currently
absent, and their identification is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate
that spin current driven by the thermal gradient sensitively probes the nature
of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. We should note that the spin
polarization of the condensate in the momentum space induces the spin-Seebeck
effect, and the spin-dependent chirality (spin-chirality) of the condensate
induces the spin-Nernst effect in nonunitary superconductors. Notably, the
nonvanishing spin-Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary
superconductivity in materials because it reflects the spin polarization of the
Cooper pairs in the momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin
magnetization vanishes. Our results position the spin caloritronics phenomena
as a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.

</p><i>Mayank Sharma, A. Bhattacharyay</i>
<p>Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and
experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of
membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can
make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is
presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we
analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion
on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We
argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's
formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential that can have
substantial contribution to system's transport. Alternatively, we relate this
to the existence of an emergent force of entropic origin that dictates the
transport near interfaces.

<br>
</p><i>Lois Smith, H. Ali Karimi-Varzaneh, Sebastian Finger, Giuliana Giunta, Alessandro Troisi, Paola Carbone</i>
<p>Polymer composite materials require softening to reduce their glass
transition temperature and improve processability. To this end, plasticizers,
which are small organic molecules, are added to the polymer matrix. The
miscibility of these plasticizers has a large impact on their effectiveness and
therefore their interactions with the polymer matrix must be carefully
considered. Many plasticizer characteristics, including their size, topology
and flexibility, can impact their miscibility and, because of the exponentially
large numbers of plasticizers, the current trial-and-error approach is very
ineffective. In this work we show that using molecular simulations of a small
dataset of 48 plasticizers, it is possible to identify topological and
thermodynamic descriptors that are proxy for their miscibility. Using ad-hoc
molecular dynamics simulation set-ups that are relatively computationally
inexpensive, we establish correlations between the plasticizers' topology,
internal flexibility, thermodynamics of aggregation and their degree of
miscibility and use these descriptors to classify the molecules as miscible or
immiscible. With all available data we also construct a decision tree model
which achieves a F1 score of 0.86 +/- 0.01 with repeated, stratified 5-fold
cross-validation, indicating that this machine learning method is a promising
route to fully automate the screening. By evaluating the individual performance
of the descriptors, we show this procedure enables a 10-fold reduction of the
test space and provides the basis for the development of workflows which can
efficiently screen thousands of plasticizers with a variety of features.

<p>We introduce QDsim, a python package tailored for the rapid generation of
charge stability diagrams in large-scale quantum dot devices, extending beyond
traditional double or triple dots. QDsim is founded on the constant interaction
model from which we rephrase the task of finding the lowest energy charge
configuration as a convex optimization problem. Therefore, we can leverage the
existing package CVXPY, in combination with an appropriate powerful solver, for
the convex optimization which streamlines the creation of stability diagrams
and polytopes. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate how QDsim enables the
generation of large-scale dataset that can serve a basis for the training of
machine-learning models for automated tuning algorithms. While the package
currently does not support quantum effects beyond the constant interaction
model, QDsim is a tool that directly addresses the critical need for
cost-effective and expeditious data acquisition for better tuning algorithms in
order to accelerate the development of semiconductor quantum devices.

<h3>Floquet topological transitions in 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model:  interplay between time reversal symmetry breaking and dimerization</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Adrian Pena, Bogdan Ostahie, Cristian Radu</i>
<p>We theoretically study the 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the context of
Floquet topological insulators (FTIs). FTIs are systems which undergo
topological phase transitions, governed by Chern numbers, as a result of time
reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking by a time periodic process. In our proposed
model, the condition of TRS breaking is achieved by circularly polarized light
irradiation. We analytically show that TRS breaking is forbidden in the absence
of second order neighbors hopping. In the absence of light irradiation, we
identify a symmetry-protected degeneracy and prove the appearance of a flat
band along a specific direction in the momentum space. Furthermore, we employ a
novel method to show that the four unit cell atoms, in the absence of
irradiation, can be interpreted as conserved spin states. With the breaking of
TRS via light irradiation, these spin states are no longer conserved, leading
to the emergence of chiral edge states. We also show how the interplay between
the TRS breaking and dimerization leads to a complex phase diagram. The
validity of our findings is substantiated through Chern numbers, spectral
properties, localization of chiral edge states and simulations of quantum Hall
transport. Our model is suitable not only for condensed matter (materials), but
also for cold gases trapped in optical lattices or electric circuits.

$T_c$ tuned by B and Ge between 0 and 0.6 K. Within BCS weak-coupling theory,
$T_c$ evolves exponentially with both the density of states and the
electron-phonon potential. While B doping affects both, through the increase of
the carrier density and the tensile strain, Ge incorporation allows addressing
independently the lattice deformation influence on superconductivity. To
estimate the lattice parameter modulation with B and Ge, Vegard's law is
validated for the ternary $SiGeB$ bulk alloy by Density Functional Theory
calculations. Its validity is furthermore confirmed experimentally by X-Ray
Diffraction. We highlight a global linear dependence of $T_c$ vs. lattice
parameter, common for both $Si:B$ and $Si_{1-x}Ge_{x}:B$, with $\delta T_c/T_c
\sim 50\,\%$ for $\delta a/a \sim 1\,\%$.

<p>Degeneracy and symmetry have a profound relation in quantum systems. Here, we
report gate-tunable subband degeneracy in PbTe nanowires with a nearly
symmetric cross-sectional shape. The degeneracy is revealed in electron
transport by the absence of a quantized plateau. Utilizing a dual gate design,
we can apply an electric field to lift the degeneracy, reflected as emergence
of the plateau. This degeneracy and its tunable lifting were challenging to
observe in previous nanowire experiments, possibly due to disorder. Numerical
simulations can qualitatively capture our observation, shedding light on device
parameters for future applications.

<p>The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and
entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the
dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple
linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an
alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the
``anti-Coulomb'' interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and
repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and
experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the
non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.

<p>The Legendre transformation is a crucial tool in theoretical physics, known
for its symmetry, especially when applied to multivariate functions. In
statistical mechanics, ensembles represent the central focus. Leveraging the
dimensionless aspect of Legendre transformation, this paper explores the
transformation process from the entropy characteristic function of
microcanonical ensembles to the analogous definition of partition function
transformation. Additionally, it derives characteristic functions, partition
functions, and establishes their interrelations, along with deriving
corresponding thermodynamic formulas for various ensembles. This streamlined
approach sheds light on the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and
underscores the symmetry inherent in Legendre transformation.

<h3>Statistical Field Theory of Polarizable Polymer Chains with Nonlocal  Dipolar Interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02848" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02848</a>
<br>

<p>The electromechanical response of polymeric soft matter to applied electric
fields is of fundamental scientific interest as well as relevant to
technologies for sensing and actuation. Several existing theoretical and
numerical approaches for polarizable polymers subject to a combined applied
electric field and stretch are based on discrete monomer models. In these
models, accounting for the interactions between the induced dipoles on monomers
is challenging due to the nonlocality of these interactions. On the other hand,
the framework of statistical field theory provides a continuous description of
polymer chains that potentially enables a tractable way to account for these
interactions. However, prior formulations using this framework have been
restricted to the case of weak anisotropy of the monomer polarizability.
This paper formulates a general approach based in the framework of
statistical field theory to account for the nonlocal nature of the dipolar
interactions without any restrictions on the anisotropy or nonlinearity of the
polarizability of the monomer. The approach is based on 3 key elements: (1) the
statistical field theory framework, in which the discrete monomers are
regularized to a continuous dipole distribution; (2) a replacement of the
nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions by the local electrostatics PDE with the
continuous dipole distribution as the forcing; (3) the use of a completely
general relation between the polarization and the local electric field. Rather
than treat the dipole-dipole interactions directly, the continuous description
in the field theory enables the computationally-tractable nonlocal-to-local
transformation. Further, it enables the use of a realistic
statistical-mechanical ensemble wherein the average far-field applied electric
field is prescribed, rather than prescribing the applied field at every point
in the polymer domain.

<h3>Efficient Structure-Informed Featurization and Property Prediction of  Ordered, Dilute, and Random Atomic Structures</h3>

<p>Structure-informed materials informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline of
materials science relying on the featurization of atomic structures or
configurations to construct vector, voxel, graph, graphlet, and other
representations useful for machine learning prediction of properties,
fingerprinting, and generative design. This work discusses how current
featurizers typically perform redundant calculations and how their efficiency
could be improved by considering (1) fundamentals of crystallographic (orbits)
equivalency to optimize ordered cases and (2) representation-dependent
equivalency to optimize cases of dilute, doped, and defect structures with
broken symmetry. It also discusses and contrasts ways of (3) approximating
random solid solutions occupying arbitrary lattices under such representations.
Efficiency improvements discussed in this work were implemented within
pySIPFENN or python toolset for Structure-Informed Property and Feature
Engineering with Neural Networks developed by authors since 2019 and shown to
increase performance from 2 to 10 times for typical inputs. Throughout this
work, the authors explicitly discuss how these advances can be applied to
different kinds of similar tools in the community.

<h3>Structural build-up at rest in the induction and acceleration periods of  OPC</h3>

<p>Structural build-up in fresh cement paste at rest is characterized by time
evolutions of storage modulus and yield stress, which both increase linearly in
time during the induction period of hydration, followed by an exponential
evolution after entering the acceleration period. While it is understood that
C-S-H formation at contact points between cement particles dictates build-up in
the acceleration period, the mechanism in the induction period lacks consensus.
Here, we provide experimental evidence that, at least in absence of admixtures,
structural build-up at rest originates in both periods from the same mechanism.
We couple calorimetry and oscillatory shear measurements of OPC at different
w/c ratios, capturing how the storage modulus evolves with changes in
cumulative heat. We obtain an exponential relation between stiffness and heat,
with the same exponent in both the induction and acceleration periods. This
suggests that C-S-H formation dictates build-up at rest in both periods.

<h3>Discovery of universal phonon thermal Hall effect in crystals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xiaobo Jin, Xu Zhang, Wenbo Wan, Hanru Wang, Yihan Jiao, Shiyan Li</i>
<p>Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises
from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While
magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some
magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggest that phonons play
a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown.
Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range
of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductor: SrTiO$_3$, SiO$_2$ (quartz), MgO
and Si. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO$_3$ and
chiral phonons in SiO$_2$ may complicate the interpretation of THE, the
striking observations of THE in the trivial insulator MgO and high-purity
intrinsic semiconductor Si demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property
of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this
universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |$\kappa_{xy}$|
$\sim$ $\kappa_{xx}^2$. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental
physics of phonons in magnetic field, which must come from the direct coupling
between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE
in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic
materials need to be reconsidered.

<h3>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with  matter</h3>

</p><i>Matjaž Kebrič, Ulrich Schollwöck, Fabian Grusdt</i>
<p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in
strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is
coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism
can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to
dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the
problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to
gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field
theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with
superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We
first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of
confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological
transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the
phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the
main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's
function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This
simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We
thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field
polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and
show that they reliably capture the various phases.

<h3>Electron-Phonon Coupling using Many-Body Perturbation Theory:  Implementation in the Questaal Electronic Structure Suite</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Savio Laricchia, Casey Eichstaedt, Dimitar Pashov, Mark van Schilfgaarde</i>
<p>The ability to calculate the electron-phonon coupling (e-ph) from first
principles is of tremendous interest in materials science, as it provides a
non-empirical approach to understand and predict a wide range of phenomena.
While this has largely been accomplished in the Kohn-Sham framework of density
functional theory (KS-DFT), it is becoming more apparent that standard
approximations in KS-DFT can be inaccurate. These discrepancies are often
attributed to a non-local potential where more advanced approaches to DFT or
many-body perturbation theory have been used. However, a highly reliable and
efficient first-principles approach to compute these quantities is still
missing. With the goal of realizing a high-fidelity description of e-ph, we
present a new field-theoretical methodology, incorporating the seminal work of
Baym and Hedin within the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW)
approximation, and the Questaal electronic structure package. We show within
the response function framework employed here, that no Pulay corrections are
needed to account for a change in the basis functions.
