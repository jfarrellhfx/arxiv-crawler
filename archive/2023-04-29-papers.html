<h3>Constrained $s$-wave weak-coupling superconductivity in multiband  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13741</a>

We consider superconductivity in a system with $N$ Fermi surfaces, including
intraband and interband effective electron-electron interactions. The effective
interaction is described by an $N \times N$ matrix whose elements are assumed
to be constant in thin momentum shells around each Fermi surface, giving rise
to $s$-wave superconductivity. Starting with attractive intraband interactions
in all $N$ bands, we show that too strong interband interactions are
detrimental to sustaining $N$ nonzero components of the superconducting order
parameter. In general, components of the superconducting order parameter are
linear combinations of the pairing amplitudes in each band. We demonstrate that
the number of nonzero components of the superconducting order parameter is
equal to the number of positive eigenvalues of the interaction matrix.
Conversely, the dimensionality reduction of the order-parameter space is given
by the number of nonpositive eigenvalues of the interaction matrix. Using
general models and models for superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
and iron pnictides, we show that constraints must be imposed to avoid spurious
solutions to the gap equations that do not represent thermodynamically stable
superconducting states.

<h3>Infernal and Exceptional Edge Modes: Non-Hermitian Topology Beyond the  Skin Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13743</a>

The classification of point gap topology in all local non-Hermitian symmetry
classes has been recently established. However, many entries in the resulting
periodic table have only been discussed in a formal setting and still lack a
physical interpretation in terms of their bulk-boundary correspondence. Here,
we derive the edge signatures of all two-dimensional phases with intrinsic
point gap topology. While in one dimension point gap topology invariably leads
to the non-Hermitian skin effect, non-Hermitian boundary physics is
significantly richer in two dimensions. We find two broad classes of
non-Hermitian edge states: (1) Infernal points, where a skin effect occurs only
at a single edge momentum, while all other edge momenta are devoid of edge
states. Under semi-infinite boundary conditions, the point gap thereby closes
completely, but only at a single edge momentum. (2) Non-Hermitian exceptional
point dispersions, where edge states persist at all edge momenta and furnish an
anomalous number of symmetry-protected exceptional points. Surprisingly, the
latter class of systems allows for a finite, non-extensive number of edge
states with a well defined dispersion along all generic edge terminations.
Instead, the point gap only closes along the real and imaginary eigenvalue
axes, realizing a novel form of non-Hermitian spectral flow.

This review is a contribution to a book dedicated to the memory of Michael E.
Fisher. The first example of a quantum many body system not expected to have
any quasiparticle excitations was the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory. The
absence of quasiparticles can be established in the compressible, metallic
state of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of fermions with random interactions. The
solvability of the latter model has enabled numerous computations of the
non-quasiparticle dynamics of chaotic many-body states, such as those expected
to describe quantum black holes. This chapter reviews thermodynamic properties
of the SYK model, and describes how they have led to an understanding of the
universal structure of the low energy density of states of charged black holes
without low energy supersymmetry.

<h3>Making rare events typical in chaotic maps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13754</a>
<br>
<i>Ricardo Gutiérrez, Adrián Canella-Ortiz, Carlos Pérez-Espigares</i>
<br>
<br>
Dynamical fluctuations or rare events associated with atypical trajectories
in chaotic maps due to specific initial conditions can be very relevant, as the
may lead to stability islands or regions in phase space with other features of
interest. Yet, finding such initial conditions is a daunting task precisely
because of the chaotic nature of the system. In this work, we circumvent this
problem by proposing a framework for finding an effective
topologically-conjugate map whose typical trajectories correspond to atypical
ones of the original map. This is illustrated by means of examples which focus
on counterbalancing the instability of fixed points and periodic orbits, as
well as on the characterization of a dynamical phase transition involving the
finite-time Lyapunov exponent. The procedure parallels that of the application
of the generalized Doob transform in the stochastic dynamics of Markov chains,
diffusive process and open quantum systems, which in each case results in a new
process having the prescribed statistics in its stationary state. This work
thus brings chaotic maps into the increasing family of systems whose rare
fluctuations can be characterized and controlled by means of a large-deviation
formalism.

<h3>Simulations of the dynamics of quantum impurity problems with matrix  product states</h3>

The Anderson impurity model is a paradigmatic example in the study of
strongly correlated quantum systems and describes an interacting quantum dot
coupled to electronic leads. In this work, we characterize the emergence of the
Kondo effect by investigating the model dynamics following a quantum quench
based on matrix product state simulations. The relaxation of the impurity
magnetization allows for the estimate of the predicted universal scaling of the
Kondo temperature as a function of the impurity-lead hybridization and quantum
dot repulsion. Additionally, our simulations permit us to evaluate the current
in the nonequilibrium quasi-steady state appearing after the quench. Through
their values, we examine the dependence of the conductance on the voltage bias
$V_b$ and on the impurity chemical potential $V_g$, which displays a zero-bias
Kondo peak. Our results are relevant for transport measurements in Coulomb
blockaded devices, and, in particular, in quantum dots induced in nanowires.

<h3>Fluid-solid transitions in photonic crystals of soft, thermoresponsive  microgels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13767</a>

<br>

Microgels are often discussed as well-suited model system for soft colloids.
In contrast to rigid spheres, the microgel volume and, coupled to this, the
volume fraction in dispersion can be manipulated by external stimuli. This
behavior is particularly interesting at high packings where phase transitions
can be induced by external triggers such as temperature in case of
thermoresponsive microgels. A challenge, however, is the determination of the
real volume occupied by these deformable, soft objects and consequently, to
determine the boundaries of the phase transitions. Here we propose core-shell
microgels with a rigid silica core and a crosslinked, thermoresponsive
poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) shell with a carefully chosen shell-to-core
size ratio as ideal model colloids to study fluid-solid transitions that are
inducible by millikelvin changes in temperature. Specifically, we identify the
temperature ranges where crystallization and melting occur using absorbance
spectroscopy in a range of concentrations. Slow annealing from the fluid to the
crystalline state leads to photonic crystals with Bragg peaks in the visible
wavelength range and very narrow linewidths. Small-angle X-ray scattering is
then used to confirm the structure of the fluid phase as well as the long-range
order, crystal structure and microgel volume fraction in the solid phase.
Thanks to the scattering contrasts and volume ratio of the cores with respect
to the shells, the scattering data do allow for form factor analysis revealing
osmotic deswelling at volume fractions approaching and also exceeding the hard
sphere packing limit.

<h3>Resolving the Hydrophobicity of Me-4PACz Hole Transport Layer for  High-Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</h3>

<br>
<br>
[4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazole-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz)
self-assembled monolayer (SAM) has been employed in perovskite single junction
and tandem devices demonstrating high efficiencies. However, a uniform
perovskite layer does not form due to the hydrophobicity of Me-4PACz. Here, we
tackle this challenge by adding a conjugated polyelectrolyte
poly(9,9-bis(3'-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9dioctylfluorene)dibromide
(PFN-Br) to the Me-4PACz in a specific ratio, defines as Pz:PFN. With this
mixing engineering strategy of Pz:PFN, the PFN-Br interacts with the A-site
cation and is confirmed via solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance studies.
The narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of diffraction peaks of perovskite
film revealed improved crystallization on the optimal mixing ratio of Pz:PFN.
Interestingly, the mixing of PFN-Br additionally tunes the work function of the
Me-4PACz as revealed by the Kelvin probe force microscopy and built-in-voltage
estimation in solar cells. Devices employing optimized Pz:PFN mixing ratio
deliver open-circuit voltage (Voc)of 1.16 V and efficiency >20% for perovskites
with a bandgap of 1.6 eV with high reproducibility and concomitant stability.
Considering significant research on Me-4PACz SAM, our work highlights the
importance of obtaining a uniform perovskite layer with improved yield and
performance.

<h3>A derivation of the kappa distribution in non-equilibrium, steady-state  plasmas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13792" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13792</a>
<br>
<i>Sergio Davis, Gonzalo Avaria, Biswajit Bora, Jalaj Jain, José Moreno, Cristian Pavez, Leopoldo Soto</i>
<br>
<br>
Kappa-distributed velocities in plasmas are common in a wide variety of
settings, from low-density to high-density plasmas, and appear in both space
and laboratory plasmas. Despite being widely used as a model, the origin of the
kappa distribution remains, to this day, unclear. For instance, deviations from
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution are sometimes regarded as a signature of the
non-additivity of the thermodynamic entropy, although there are alternative
frameworks such as superstatistics where such an assumption is not needed. In
this work we recover the kappa distribution for particle velocities in a
non-equilibrium, steady-state plasma from the theory of superstatistics,
assuming only a single requirement on the dependence between the kinetic energy
of a test particle and that of its immediate environment. Most importantly,
unlike previous derivations based on superstatistics, we do not make any
assumption about temperature or its statistical distribution, instead obtaining
them from the requirement on kinetic energies. Our results suggest that a
description of kappa-distributed plasma is simpler in terms of features of the
inverse temperature distribution rather than the traditional parameters
$\kappa$ and the thermal velocity $v_{\text{th}}$.

<h3>Temperature Evolution of Domains and Intradomain Chirality in  1T-TaS$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13805</a>

<i>Boning Yu, Ghilles Ainouche, Manoj Singh, Bishnu Sharma, James Huber, Michael C. Boyer</i>
<br>
<br>
We use scanning tunneling microscopy to study the temperature evolution of
the atomic-scale properties of the nearly-commensurate charge density wave
(NC-CDW) state of the low-dimensional material, 1T-TaS$_2$. Our measurements at
203 K, 300 K, and 354 K, roughly spanning the temperature range of the NC-CDW
state, show that while the average CDW periodicity is temperature independent,
domaining and the local evolution of the CDW lattice within a domain is
temperature dependent. Further, we characterize the temperature evolution of
the displacement field associated with the recently-discovered intradomain
chirality of the NC-CDW state by calculating the local rotation vector.
Intradomain chirality throughout the NC-CDW phase is likely driven by a strong
coupling of the CDW lattice to the atomic lattice.

<h3>Recent advances in describing and driving crystal nucleation  usingmachine learning and artificial intelligence</h3>

<br>
<br>
With the advent of faster computer processors and especially graphics
processing units (GPUs) over the last few decades, the use of data-intensive
machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has increased greatly,
and the study of crystal nucleation has been one of the beneficiaries. In this
review, we outline how ML and AI have been applied to address four outstanding
difficulties of crystal nucleation: how to discover better reaction coordinates
(RCs) for describing accurately non-classical nucleation situations; the
development of more accurate force fields for describing the nucleation of
multiple polymorphs or phases for a single system; more robust identification
methods for determining crystal phases and structures; and as a method to yield
improved course-grained models for studying nucleation.

<h3>Atomic Layer Deposition Nucleation Dependence on Diamond Surface  Termination</h3>

Surface termination and interfacial interactions are critical for advanced
solid-state quantum applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that atomic
layer deposition (ALD) can both provide valuable insight on the chemical
environment of the surface, having sufficient sensitivity to distinguish
between the common diamond (001) surface termination types and passivate these
interfaces as desired. We selected diamond substrates exhibiting both smooth
and anomalously rough surfaces to probe the effect of morphology on ALD
nucleation. We use high resolution in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry to
monitor the surface reaction with sub-angstrom resolution, to evaluate the
nucleation of an ALD Al2O3 process as a function of different ex and in situ
treatments to the diamond surface. In situ water dosing and high vacuum
annealing provided the most favorable environment for nucleation of
dimethylaluminum isopropoxide and water ALD. Hydrogen termination passivated
both smooth and rough surfaces while triacid cleaning passivated the smooth
surface only, with striking effectiveness.

<h3>Theoretical Puncture Mechanics of Soft Compressible Solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13838</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Fregonese, Zhiyuan Tong, Sibo Wang, Mattia Bacca</i>
<br>
<br>
Accurate prediction of the force required to puncture a soft material is
critical in many fields like medical technology, food processing, and
manufacturing. However, such a prediction strongly depends on our understanding
of the complex nonlinear behavior of the material subject to deep indentation
and complex failure mechanisms. Only recently we developed theories capable of
correlating puncture force with material properties and needle geometry.
However, such models are based on simplifications that seldom limit their
applicability to real cases. One common assumption is the incompressibility of
the cut material, albeit no material is truly incompressible. In this paper we
propose a simple model that accounts for linearly elastic compressibility, and
its interplay with toughness, stiffness, and elastic strain-stiffening.
Confirming previous theories and experiments, materials having high-toughness
and low-modulus exhibit the highest puncture resistance at a given needle
radius. Surprisingly, in these conditions, we observe that incompressible
materials exhibit the lowest puncture resistance, where volumetric
compressibility can create an additional (strain) energy barrier to puncture.
Our model provides a valuable tool to assess the puncture resistance of soft
compressible materials and suggests new design strategies for sharp needles and
puncture-resistant materials.

<h3>Kinetic temperature and pressure of an active Tonks gas</h3>

<br>
<i>Elijah Schiltz-Rouse, Hyeongjoo Row, Stewart A. Mallory</i>
<br>
<br>
Using computer simulation and analytical theory, we study an active analog of
the well-known Tonks gas, where active Brownian particles are confined to a
one-dimensional (1D) channel. By introducing the notion of a kinetic
temperature, we derive an accurate analytical expression for the pressure and
clarify the paradoxical behavior where active Brownian particles confined to 1D
exhibit anomalous clustering but no motility-induced phase transition. More
generally, this work provides a deeper understanding of pressure in active
systems as we uncover a unique link between the kinetic temperature and swim
pressure valid for active Brownian particles in higher dimensions.

<h3>Elucidating the active phases of CoOx films on Au(111) in the CO  Oxidation Reaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using CoOx thin films supported on Au(111) single crystal surfaces as model
catalysts for the CO oxidation reaction we show that three reaction regimes
exist in response to chemical and topographic restructuring of the CoOx
catalyst as a function of reactant gas phase CO/O2 stoichiometry a finding that
highlights the versatility of catalysts and their evolution in response to
reaction conditions. Under oxygen-lean conditions and moderate temperatures
(below 150C degrees) partially oxidized films containing CoO were found to be
efficient catalysts. In contrast, stoichiometric CoO films containing only Co2+
form carbonates in the presence of CO that poison the reaction below 300 C
degrees. Under oxygen-rich conditions a more oxidized catalyst phase forms
containing Co3+ species that is effective in a wide temperature range. Resonant
photoemission spectroscopy (ResPES) revealed the unique role of Co3+ sites in
catalyzing the CO oxidation. DFT calculations provided deeper insights into the
pathway and free energy barriers for the reactions on these oxide phases.

<h3>Enhancing Inverse Problem Solutions with Accurate Surrogate Simulators  and Promising Candidates</h3>

Deep-learning inverse techniques have attracted significant attention in
recent years. Among them, the neural adjoint (NA) method, which employs a
neural network surrogate simulator, has demonstrated impressive performance in
the design tasks of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEM). However, the
impact of the surrogate simulators' accuracy on the solutions in the NA method
remains uncertain. Furthermore, achieving sufficient optimization becomes
challenging in this method when the surrogate simulator is large, and
computational resources are limited. Additionally, the behavior under
constraints has not been studied, despite its importance from the engineering
perspective. In this study, we investigated the impact of surrogate simulators'
accuracy on the solutions and discovered that the more accurate the surrogate
simulator is, the better the solutions become. We then developed an extension
of the NA method, named Neural Lagrangian (NeuLag) method, capable of
efficiently optimizing a sufficient number of solution candidates. We then
demonstrated that the NeuLag method can find optimal solutions even when
handling sufficient candidates is difficult due to the use of a large and
accurate surrogate simulator. The resimulation errors of the NeuLag method were
approximately 1/50 compared to previous methods for three AEM tasks. Finally,
we performed optimization under constraint using NA and NeuLag, and confirmed
their potential in optimization with soft or hard constraints. We believe our
method holds potential in areas that require large and accurate surrogate
simulators.

<h3>Microbial Corrosion Prevention by Citrobacter sp. Biofilms</h3>

Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) compromises the integrity of
many technologically relevant metals. Protective coatings based on synthetic
materials pose potential environmental impacts. Here, we report a MIC resistant
coating based on a biofilm matrix of Citrobacter sp. strain MIC21 on underlying
copper (Cu) surfaces. Three identical corrosion cells varying in the type of
working electrode (annealed Cu, 29.5% coldworked, and 56.2% coldworked Cu) were
used. Graphite plate and Ag/AgCl served as counter and reference electrodes,
respectively. The working electrolyte was based on lactate-C media along with
an inocula consisting of Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 and
Citrobacter sp. strain MIC21. Passivating effect of the co-cultured biofilm
matrix was observed in the form of an ennoblement effect. Tests based on
sequencing, microscopy, and spectroscopy revealed the formation of a compact
biofilm matrix dominated by strain MIC21 cells, exopolymers, and insoluble
precipitates. This matrix displayed elastic modulus (a measure of rigidity) as
high as 0.8 Gpa and increased corrosion resistance by ~10-fold. Interestingly,
strain MIC21 has the capacity to inhibit the undesirable growth of aggressive
strain G20. Additional corrosion tests also substantiated the passivation
effects of strain MIC21. We provide mechanistic insight into the underlying
reasons responsible for corrosion prevention behavior of the biofilm matrix.

<h3>Cross-Examination of Photoinitiated Carrier and Structural Dynamics of  Black Phosphorus at Elevated Fluences</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13869" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13869</a>

<br>
<br>
Revived attention in black phosphorus (bP) has been tremendous in the past
decade. While many photoinitiated experiments have been conducted, a
cross-examination of bP's photocarrier and structural dynamics is still
lacking. In this report, we provide such analysis by examining time-resolved
data acquired using optical transient reflectivity and reflection ultrafast
electron diffraction, two complementary methods under the same experimental
conditions. At elevated excitation fluences, we find that more than 90% of the
photoinjected carriers are annihilated within the first picosecond (ps) and
transfer their energy to phonons in a nonthermal, anisotropic fashion.
Electronically, the remaining carrier density around the band edges induces a
significant interaction that leads to an interlayer lattice contraction in a
few ps but soon diminishes as a result of the continuing loss of carriers.
Structurally, phonon-phonon scattering redistributes the energy in the lattice
and results in the generation of out-of-plane coherent acoustic phonons and
thermal lattice expansion. Their onset times at ~6 ps are found to be in good
agreement. Later, a thermalized quasi-equilibrium state is reached following a
period of about 40-50 ps. Hence, we propose a picture with five temporal
regimes for bP's photodynamics.

<h3>Non-Hermitian topolectrical circuit sensor with high sensitivity</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electronic sensors play important roles in various applications, such as
industry and environmental monitoring, biomedical sample ingredient analysis,
wireless networks and so on. However, the sensitivity and robustness of current
schemes are often limited by the low quality-factors of resonators and
fabrication disorders. Hence, exploring new mechanisms of the electronic sensor
with a high-level sensitivity and a strong robustness is of great significance.
Here, we propose a new way to design electronic sensors with superior
performances based on exotic properties of non-Hermitian topological physics.
Owing to the extreme boundary-sensitivity of non-Hermitian topological zero
modes, the frequency shift induced by boundary perturbations can show an
exponential growth trend with respect to the size of non-Hermitian
topolectrical circuit sensors. Moreover, such an exponential growth sensitivity
is also robust against disorders of circuit elements. Using designed
non-Hermitian topolectrical circuit sensors, we further experimentally verify
the ultra-sensitive identification of the distance, rotation angle, and liquid
level with the designed capacitive devices. Our proposed non-Hermitian
topolectrical circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in
ultra-sensitive environmental monitoring and show an exciting prospect for
nextgeneration sensing technologies.

<h3>Typical and atypical solutions in non-convex neural networks with  discrete and continuous weights</h3>

<br>
We study the binary and continuous negative-margin perceptrons as simple
non-convex neural network models learning random rules and associations. We
analyze the geometry of the landscape of solutions in both models and find
important similarities and differences. Both models exhibit subdominant
minimizers which are extremely flat and wide. These minimizers coexist with a
background of dominant solutions which are composed by an exponential number of
algorithmically inaccessible small clusters for the binary case (the frozen
1-RSB phase) or a hierarchical structure of clusters of different sizes for the
spherical case (the full RSB phase). In both cases, when a certain threshold in
constraint density is crossed, the local entropy of the wide flat minima
becomes non-monotonic, indicating a break-up of the space of robust solutions
into disconnected components. This has a strong impact on the behavior of
algorithms in binary models, which cannot access the remaining isolated
clusters. For the spherical case the behaviour is different, since even beyond
the disappearance of the wide flat minima the remaining solutions are shown to
always be surrounded by a large number of other solutions at any distance, up
to capacity. Indeed, we exhibit numerical evidence that algorithms seem to find
solutions up to the SAT/UNSAT transition, that we compute here using an 1RSB
approximation. For both models, the generalization performance as a learning
device is shown to be greatly improved by the existence of wide flat minimizers
even when trained in the highly underconstrained regime of very negative
margins.

a pair of counterpropagating edge modes. The edge modes are robust against the
sharp bend of $60^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}$, which can form a resonator with
whispering gallery modes. Here, we demonstrate the asymmetric emission of
chiral coupling from single quantum dots in a topological resonator by tuning
the coupling between a quantum emitter and a resonator mode. Under a magnetic
field in Faraday configuration, the exciton state from a single quantum dot
splits into two exciton spin states with opposite circularly polarized
emissions due to Zeeman effect. Two branches of the quantum dot emissions
couple to a resonator mode in different degrees, resulting in an asymmetric
chiral emission. Without the demanding of site-control of quantum emitters for
chiral quantum optics, an extra degree of freedom to tune the chiral contrast
with a topological resonator could be useful for the development of on-chip
integrated photonic circuits.

There has been a long-standing debate about the mechanism of the unusual
superconductivity in alkali-intercalated fulleride superconductors. In this
work, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
systematically investigate the electronic structures of superconducting K3C60
thin films. We observe a dispersive energy band crossing the Fermi level with
an occupied bandwidth of about 130 meV. The measured band structure shows
prominent quasiparticle kinks and a replica band involving high-energy
Jahn-Teller active Hg(8) phonon mode, reflecting strong electron-phonon
coupling in the system. The electron-phonon coupling constant is estimated to
be about 1.2, which dominates the quasiparticle mass renormalization. Moreover,
we observe an isotropic nodeless superconducting gap beyond the mean-field
estimation. Both the large electron-phonon coupling constant and large reduced
superconducting gap suggest a strong-coupling superconductivity in K3C60, while
the electronic correlation effect is indicated by the observation of a
waterfall-like band dispersion and the small bandwidth compared with the
effective Coulomb interaction. Our results not only directly visualize the
crucial band structure of superconducting fulleride but also provide important
insights into the mechanism of the unusual superconductivity.

NIMS-OS (NIMS Orchestration System) is a Python library created to realize a
closed loop of robotic experiments and artificial intelligence (AI) without
human intervention for automated materials exploration. It uses various
combinations of modules to operate autonomously. Each module acts as an AI for
materials exploration or a controller for a robotic experiments. As AI
techniques, Bayesian optimization (PHYSBO), boundless objective-free
exploration (BLOX), phase diagram construction (PDC), and random exploration
(RE) methods can be used. Moreover, a system called NIMS automated robotic
electrochemical experiments (NAREE) is available as a set of robotic
experimental equipment. Visualization tools for the results are also included,
which allows users to check the optimization results in real time. Newly
created modules for AI and robotic experiments can be added easily to extend
the functionality of the system. In addition, we developed a GUI application to
control NIMS-OS.To demonstrate the operation of NIMS-OS, we consider an
automated exploration for new electrolytes. NIMS-OS is available at

Development of process-structure-property relationships in materials science
is an important and challenging frontier which promises improved materials and
reduced time and cost in production. Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) are
a class of materials that are capable of excellent hightemperature properties.
However, due to their multi-component nature, RHEAs have a vast composition
space which presents challenges for traditional experimental exploration. Here,
quantitative models of compressive yield strength and room-temperature
plasticity are developed through a deep learning approach. Uncertainty
quantification is performed through a variety of statistical validation
techniques. Model predictions are experimentally validated through collection
of recent literature and the synthesis and experimental characterization of two
new, unreported RHEAs: AlMoTaTiZr and Al0.239Mo0.123Ta0.095Ti0.342Zr0.201.
Finally, through the application of model interpretability, features having the
greatest impact on both the mechanical property and uncertainty of the deep
learning models are revealed, and shown to agree well with current physics and
materials science theory.

<h3>Why magnetic monopole becomes dyon in topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13954</a>
<br>
<i>Shoto Aoki, Hidenori Fukaya, Naoto Kan, Mikito Koshino, Yoshiyuki Matsuki</i>
<br>
<br>
The Witten effect predicts that a magnetic monopole gains a fractional
electric charge inside topological insulators. In this work, we give a
microscopic description for this phenomenon, as well as an analogous
two-dimensional system with a vortex. %solving a ``negatively" massive Dirac
equation. We solve a regularized Dirac equation both analytically in continuum
and numerically on a lattice, adding the Wilson term to make the sign of the
fermion mass well-defined and smearing the singular gauge field in a finite
range of radius $r_1$ to make the analysis UV finite. We find that the Wilson
term locally gives a positive mass shift with a size of $1/r_1$, which
dynamically creates a finite-sized domain-wall around the monopole/vortex. We
can identify the chiral edge-localized zero modes sitting on the created
domain-wall as the origin of the electric charge. The fact that the charge
origin is not a point-like singularity but a small codimension-one domain-wall
makes the topological meaning of the zero modes clearer: they are protected by
the Atiyah-Singer index theorem on the wall, which is essential to show that
only a half of the wave function is captured by the monopole/vortex.

<h3>$\mathcal{PT}$-activated non-Hermitian skin modes</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhoutao Lei, Ching Hua Lee, Linhu Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian
physics as it ensures real energies for stable experimental realization of
non-Hermitian phenomena. In this work, we propose $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry as a
paradigm for designing new families of higher-dimensional non-Hermitian states
with unique bulk, surface, hinge or corner dynamics. Through systematically
breaking or restoring $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in different sectors of a system,
we can selectively ``activate'' or manipulate the non-Hermitian skin effect
(NHSE) in both the bulk and topological boundary states. Some fascinating new
phenomena include the directional toggling of the NHSE, an intrinsic hybrid
skin-topological effect and the flow of boundary states without chiral or
dynamical pumping. Our results extend richly into 3D or higher, with more
sophisticated interplay with hybrid skin-topological localizations and
$\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry. Based on non-interacting lattices,
$\mathcal{PT}$-activated NHSE phenomena can be observed in various optical,
photonic, electric and quantum platforms that admit gain/loss and
non-reciprocity.

<br>
<br>
We report the synthesis and characterization of thin films of the Weyl
semimetal NbAs grown on GaAs (100) and GaAs (111)B substrates. By choosing the
appropriate substrate, we can stabilize the growth of NbAs in the (001) and
(100) directions. We combine x-ray characterization with high-angle annular
dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy to understand both the
macroscopic and microscopic structure of the NbAs thin films. We show that
these films are textured with domains that are tens of nanometers in size and
that, on a macroscopic scale, are mostly aligned to a single crystalline
direction. Finally, we describe electrical transport measurements that reveal
similar behavior in films grown in both crystalline directions, namely carrier
densities of $\sim 10^{21} - 10^{22} $

<h3>Influence of oxygen on electronic correlation and transport in iron in  the outer Earth's core</h3>

<br>
<i>German G. Blesio, Leonid V. Pourovskii, Markus Aichhorn, Monica Pozzo, Dario Alfè, Jernej Mravlje</i>
<br>
<br>
Knowing the transport properties of iron under realistic conditions present
in the Earth's core is essential for the geophysical modeling of Earth's
magnetic field generation. Besides by extreme pressures and temperatures,
transport may be influenced importantly also by the presence of light elements.
Using a combination of molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and
dynamical mean-field theory methods we investigate how oxygen impurities
influence the electronic correlations and transport in the liquid outer Earth's
core. We consider a case with an oxygen content of ~10 atomic%, a value that is
believed to be close to the composition of the core. We find that the
electronic correlations are enhanced but their effect on conductivities is
moderate (compared to pure Fe, electrical conductivity drops by 10% and thermal
conductivity by 18%). The effect of electron-electron scattering alone, whereas
not large, is comparable to effects of the compositional disorder. We reveal
the mechanism behind the larger suppression of the thermal conductivity and
associated reduction of the Lorenz ratio and discuss its geophysical
significance.

<h3>Spin-Peierls transition to a Haldane phase</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present an organic compound exhibiting a spin-Peierls (SP) transition to
an effective spin-1 antiferromagnetic uniform chain, that is, the Haldane
chain. The clear disappearance of magnetization, accompanied by a structural
phase transition, is well explained by the deformation to an effective spin-1
Haldane chain. The flexibility of the molecular orbitals in the organic radical
compound allows the transformation of the exchange interactions into the
Haldane state with different topologies. The SP transition in the present
compound demonstrates a mechanism different from that of the conventional
systems, paving another path for research in quantum phenomena originating from
spin-lattice couplings.

<h3>Giant Bulk Electro-photovoltaic Effect in Hetero-nodal-line Systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Realization of giant and continuously tunable second-order photocurrent is
desired for many nonlinear optical (NLO) and optoelectronic applications, which
remains to be a great challenge. Here, based on a simple two-band model, we
propose a concept of bulk electro-photovoltaic effect, that is, an out-of-plane
external electric-field ($E_{ext}$) can continuously tune in-plane shift
current along with its sign flip in a hetero-nodal-line (HNL) system. While
strong linear optical transition around the nodal-loop may potentially generate
giant shift current, an $E_{ext}$ can effectively control the radius of
nodal-loop, which can continuously modulate the shift-vector components inside
and outside nodal-loop holding opposite signs. This concept has been
demonstrated in the HNL HSnN/MoS$_2$ system using first-principles
calculations. The HSnN/MoS$_2$ hetero-bilayer not only can produce giant shift
current with 1~2 magnitude order larger than other reported systems, but also
can realize a giant bulk electro-photovoltaic effect. Our finding opens new
routes to create and manipulate giant NLO responses in 2D materials.

This work describes Raman imaging and its data evaluation methods by using
the softwares original features: built-in fitting function and K-means cluster
analysis KMC followed by fitting in an external environment. For the first
time, these methods were compared in terms of their principles, limitations,
versatility, and process duration. The performed analysis showed the
indispensability of Raman imaging in terms of phase distribution, phase content
calculation, and stress determination. Zirconium oxide formed on different
zirconium alloys under various oxidation conditions was selected as an
exemplary material for this analysis. The reason for the material choice is
that it is an excellent example of the application of this type of Raman
analysis since both phase distribution and stress analysis in zirconium oxide
are of crucial importance for the development of zirconium alloys, especially
for nuclear applications. The juxtaposition of the results showed advantages
and limitations of both procedures allowing a definition of the criteria for
selecting the evaluation method for different applications.

<h3>Room Temperature Ferrimagnetism, Magnetodielectric and Exchange Bias  Effect in CoFeRhO$_4$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Geometrically frustrated structures combined with competing exchange
interactions that have different magnitudes are known ingredients for achieving
exotic properties. Herein, we studied detailed structural, magnetic, thermal
(specific heat), magneto-dielectric, and magnetic exchange bias properties of a
mixed 3d - 4d spinel oxide with composition CoFeRhO$_4$. Detailed
magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron powder diffraction studies (NPD)
highlight long-range ferrimagnetic ordering with an onset at 355 K. The
magnetic structure is established using a ferrimagnetic model (collinear-type)
that has a propagation vector k = 0, 0, 0. The magneto-dielectric effect
appears below the magnetic ordering temperature, and the exchange bias (EB)
effect is observed in field cooled (FC) conditions below 355 K. The
magneto-dielectric coupling in CoFeRhO$_4$ originates due to the frustration in
the structure, collinear ferrimagnetic ordering, and uncompensated magnetic
moments. The unidirectional anisotropy resulting from the uncompensated
magnetic moments causes the room-temperature exchange bias effect. Remarkably,
the appearance of technologically important properties (ferromagnetism,
magnetodielectric effect, and EB) at room temperature in CoFeRhO$_4$ indicates
its potential use in sensors or spintronics.

This paper presents structural, detailed magnetic, and exchange bias studies
in polycrystalline Ba$_{2}$ScRuO$_{6}$ synthesized at ambient pressure. In
contrast to its strontium analogue, this material crystallizes in a 6L
hexagonal structure with the space group P$\overline{3}$m1. The Rietveld
refinement using the room-temperature powder X-ray diffraction pattern suggests
a Ru-Sc disorder in the structure. The temperature variation of the
dc-electrical resistivity highlights a semiconducting behaviour with the
electron conduction corresponding to the Mott 3D-VRH model. Detailed
magnetization measurements show that Ba$_{2}$ScRuO$_{6}$ develops
antiferromagnetic ordering at T$_{N}$ $\approx$ 9 K. Interestingly, below 9 K
(T$_{N}$), the field cooled (FC) magnetic field variation of the magnetization
curves highlights exchange bias effect in the sample. The exchange bias field
reaches a maximum value of 1.24 kOe at 2 K. The exchange bias effect below the
magnetic ordering temperature can be attributed to inhomogeneous magnetic
correlations owing to the disorder in the structure.

Chiral phonons have an angular momentum which represents the microscopic
local rotation of atoms in crystals. In this theoretical investigation, we
establish a spin-wave model in a ferromagnet with exchange and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on a two-dimensional kagome lattice. We then
introduce chiral phonons, which modulate spin-spin interactions. In the
valley-phonon modes with angular momenta, the microscopic rotational motion of
atoms around their equilibrium positions are treated as an adiabatic process
and it can dynamically affect the spin configuration of electrons. By means of
the adiabatic modulation for the spin-wave model, the number of the magnon
excitations due to chiral phonons can be calculated. As a result, the change of
the number of magnons induced by chiral phonons is caused by geometrical
effects. The chiral phonons with clockwise and counterclockwise modes induce a
change of the number of magnons with opposite signs.

Traditional solid-state physics has long correlated the optical properties of
materials with their electronic structures. However, recent discoveries of
intrinsic gapped metals have challenged this classical view. Gapped metals
possess electronic properties distinct from both metals and insulators, with a
large concentration of free carriers without any intentional doping and an
internal band gap. This unique electronic structure makes gapped metals
potentially superior to materials designed by intentional doping of the wide
band gap insulators. Despite their promising applications, such as transparent
conductors, designing gapped metals for specific purposes remains challenging
due to the lack of understanding of the correlation between their electronic
band structures and optical properties. This study focuses on representative
examples of gapped metals and demonstrates the cases of (i) gapped metals
(e.g., CaN2) with strong intraband absorption in the visible range, (ii) gapped
metals (e.g., SrNbO3) with strong interband absorption in the visible range,
(iii) gapped metals (e.g., Sr5Nb5O17) that are potential transparent
conductors. We explore the complexity of identifying potential gapped metals
for transparent conductors and propose inverse materials design principles for
discovering new-generation transparent conductors.

<br>
Defect engineering is promising to tailor the physical properties of
two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors for function-oriented electronics and
optoelectronics. Compared with the extensively studied 2D binary materials, the
origin of defects and their influence on physical properties of 2D ternary
semiconductors have not been clarified. In this work, we thoroughly studied the
effect of defects on the electronic structure and optical properties of
few-layer hexagonal Znln2S4 via versatile spectroscopic tools in combination
with theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the Zn-In
anti-structural defects induce the formation of a series of donor and acceptor
levels inside the bandgap, leading to rich recombination paths for defect
emission and extrinsic absorption. Impressively, the emission of donor-acceptor
pair (DAP) in Znln2S4 can be significantly tailored by electrostatic gating due
to efficient tunability of Fermi level (Ef). Furthermore, the layer-dependent
dipole orientation of defect emission in Znln2S4 was directly revealed by back
focal plane (BFP) imagining, where it presents obviously in-plane dipole
orientation within a dozen layers thickness of Znln2S4. These unique features
of defects in Znln2S4 including extrinsic absorption, rich recombination paths,
gate tunability and in-plane dipole orientation will definitely benefit to the
advanced orientation-functional optoelectronic applications.

spin magnetization vanishes, at the energy of the Weyl points. The magnetic
moments at each site are correlated with the orbital magnetization, and can be

<h3>Defects drive the tribocharging strength of PTFE</h3>

<br>
<br>
If polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), commonly known as Teflon, is put into
contact and rubbed against another material, almost surely it will be more
effective than its counterpart in collecting negative charges. This simple,
basic property is captured by the so called triboelectric series, where PTFE
ranks extremely high, and that qualitatively orders materials in terms of their
ability to electrostatically charge upon contact and rubbing. However, while
classifying materials, the series does not provide an explanation of their
triboelectric strength, besides a loose correlation with the workfunction.
Indeed, despite being an extremely familiar process, known from centuries,
tribocharging is still elusive and not fully understood. In this work we employ
density functional theory to look for the origin of PTFE tribocharging
strength. We study how charge transfers when pristine or defective PTFE is put
in contact with different clean and oxidised metals. Our results show the
important role played by defects in enhancing charge transfer. Interestingly
and unexpectedly our results show that negatively charged chains are more
stable than neutral ones, if slightly bent. Indeed deformations can be easily
promoted in polymers as PTFE, especially in tribological contacts. These
results suggest that, in designing materials in view of their triboelectric
properties, the characteristics of their defects could be a performance
determining factor.

<br>
<br>
Trimeron lattice excitations in magnetite, in the form of the $c$ axis
switching at temperatures below the Verwey temperature $T_V$, is presented
based on magnetization experiments. Few parameters, switching field $B_{sw}$,
energy density needed to switch the axis $E_{sw}$, and activation energy $U$,
are observed as a function of magnetite doping (with Zn, Al and Ti),
nonstoichiometry and hydrostatic pressure ($p < 1.2$ GPa). It is shown that
doping/nonstoichiometry drastically increase the switching field, activation
and switching energies, while pressure lowers $B_{sw}$. Based on these and also
on $p$ impact on $U$ (pressure lowers $U$ for Zn doped magnetite, but slightly
increases it for stoichiometric sample) we conclude that the trimeron
manipulation in the process of axis switching and mechanisms leading to the
Verwey transition are not the same. Finally, we observe some change of magnetic
anisotropy in magnetite at pressure $p > 0.8$ GPa.

We employ the sign-problem-free projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo
method to study a microscopic model of SU($N$) fermions with singlet-bond and
triplet-current interactions on the square lattice. We find the gapped singlet
$p_x$ and gapless triplet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ density wave states in the half-filled
$N=4$ model. Specifically, the triplet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ density wave order is
observed in the weak triplet-current interaction regime. As the triplet-current
interaction strength is further increased, our simulations demonstrate a
transition to the singlet $p_x$ density wave state, accompanied by a gapped
mixed-ordered area where the two orders coexist. With increasing singlet-bond
interaction strength, the triplet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave order persists up to a
critical point after which the singlet $p_x$ density wave state is stabilized,
while the ground state is disordered in between the two ordered phases. The
analytical continuation is then performed to derive the single-particle
spectrum. In the spectra of triplet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and singlet $p_x$ density
waves, the anisotropic Dirac cone and the parabolic shape around the Dirac
point are observed, respectively. As for the mixed-ordered area, a
single-particle gap opens and the velocities remain anisotropic at the Dirac
point.

Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have drawn tremendous interests due to
their unique properties. Atom intercalation in the vdW gap of layered materials
can tune their electronic structure and generate unexpected properties. Here we
report a chemical-scissor mediated method that enables metal intercalation into
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in molten salts. By using this
approach, various guest metal atoms (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ag) were
intercalated into various TMDCs hosts (such as TiS2, NbS2, TaS2, TiSe2, NbSe2,
TaSe2 and Ti0.5V0.5S2). The structure of the intercalated compound and
intercalation mechanism was investigated. The results indicate that the vdW gap
and valence state of TMDCs can be modified through metal intercalation, and the
intercalation behavior is dictated by the electron work function. Such a
chemical-scissor mediated intercalation provides an approach to tune the
physical and chemical properties of TMDCs, which may open an avenue in
functional application ranging from energy conversion to electronics.

We study experimentally and theoretically the hybridization among intralayer

field, monitor the field-induced dispersion and hybridization of intralayer and
interlayer moir\'e exciton states, and induce a cross-over from type I to type
II band alignment. Moreover, we employ perpendicular magnetic fields to map out
the dependence of the corresponding exciton Land\'e $g$-factors on the electric
field. Finally, we develop an effective theoretical model combining resonant
and non-resonant contributions to moir\'e potentials to explain the observed
phenomenology, and highlight the relevance of interlayer coupling for
structures with close energetic band alignment as in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$.

<br>
<br>
At the chiral and flat-band limits, the ground states of twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) with integer fillings are known from exact solutions [1-5] and
their dynamical and thermodynamical properties are revealed by unbiased quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations [6-10]. However, to elucidate the experimental
observations of correlated metallic, insulating and superconducting states and
their transitions, investigations for correlated states away from chiral limit
are of importance. Here we employ the momentum-space QMC simulations to
investigate the evolution of the correlated states in TBG away from chiral
limit at the charge neutrality with polarized spin/valley, which is
approximated to the filling factor $\nu=\pm3$ in experiments [11, 12]. We find
that the ground state evolves from the quatum anomalous Hall insulator into an
intriguing correlated semimetallic state as AA hopping strength reaches
experimental values. Such a state resembles the recently proposed heavy-fermion
representations with the localized electrons at the AA stacking and itinerate
electrson at the AB/BA stacking regions [13, 14]. The spectral signatures of
the localized and itinerant electrons in the heavy-fermion semimetal phase are
revealed, with the connection to experimental results being discussed.

<h3>Infrared spectra in amorphous alumina: a combined ab initio and  experimental study</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a combined study based on experimental measurements of infrared
(IR) dielectric function and first-principles calculations of IR spectra and
vibrational density of states (VDOS) of amorphous alumina (am-Al$_2$O$_3$). In
particular, we show that the main features of the imaginary part of the
dielectric function $\epsilon_2(\omega)$ at $\sim$380 and 630 cm$^{-1}$ are
related to the motions of threefold coordinated oxygen atoms, which are the
vast majority of oxygen atoms in am-Al$_2$O$_3$. Our analysis provides an
alternative point of view with respect to an earlier suggested assignment of
the vibrational modes, which relates them to the stretching and bending
vibrational modes of AlO$_{n}$ ($n=$ 4, 5, and 6) polyhedra. Our assignment is
based on the additive decomposition of the VDOS and $\epsilon_2(\omega)$
spectra, which shows that: (i) the band at $\sim$380 cm$^{-1}$ features oxygen
motions occurring in a direction normal to the plane defined by the three
nearest-neighbor aluminum atoms, i.e. out-of-plane motions of oxygen atoms;
(ii) Al--O stretching vibrations (i.e. in-plane motions of oxygen atoms) appear
at frequencies above $\sim$500 cm$^{-1}$, which characterize the vibrational
modes underlying the band at $\sim$630 cm$^{-1}$. Aluminum and fourfold
coordinated oxygen atoms contribute uniformly to the VDOS and
$\epsilon_2(\omega)$ spectra in the frequency region $\sim$350--650 cm$^{-1}$
without causing specific features. Our numerical results are in good agreement
with the previous and presently obtained experimental data on the IR dielectric
function of am-Al$_2$O$_3$ films. Finally, we show that the IR spectrum can be
modeled by assuming isotropic Born charges for aluminum atoms and fourfold
coordinated oxygen atoms, while requiring the use of three parameters, defined
in a local reference frame, for the anisotropic Born charges of threefold
coordinated oxygen atoms.

<h3>Dislocation Pinning in Helium-Implanted Tungsten: A Molecular Dynamics  Study</h3>

<br>
<i>Suchandrima Das, Andrea Sand, Felix Hofmann</i>
<br>
<br>
The interaction of edge dislocation with helium-implantation-induced defects
in tungsten is investigated using molecular dynamics. Following prior
investigations, we consider defects with two helium ions in a vacancy with a
self-interstitial bound to it (He2V-SIA). Our observations suggest 3-10
He2V-SIA cluster together, with their pinning strength on glide dislocations
increasing with size. For all cluster sizes, the dislocation bows around the
cluster, until it gets unpinned, carrying the SIAs with it and leaving behind a
helium-vacancy complex and newly created vacancies in its wake. The remnant
helium-vacancy complex has little pinning effect, highlighting the
defect-clearing process. A total solute hardening force for a distribution of
clusters of different sizes, induced by 3000 appm of helium, is found to be
approximately 700 MPa. This is in good agreement with the corresponding value
of 750 MPa estimated in a previously developed crystal plasticity model
simulating the deformation behaviour of the helium-implanted tungsten.

<h3>Breakup of quantum liquid filaments into droplets</h3>

<br>
<i>Francesco Ancilotto, Manuel Barranco, Marti Pi</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated how the Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a filament made
of a 41K-87Rb self-bound mixture may lead to an array of identical quantum
droplets, with typical breaking times which are shorter than the lifetime of
the mixture. If the filament is laterally confined --as it happens in a
toroidal trap-- and atoms of one species are in excess with respect to the
optimal, equilibrium ratio, the droplets are immersed into a superfluid
background made by the excess species which provides global phase coherence to
the system, suggesting that the droplets array in the unbalanced system may
display supersolid character. This possibility has been investigated by
computing the non-classical translational inertia coefficient. The filament may
be a reasonable representation of a self-bound mixture subject to toroidal
confinement when the bigger circle radius of the torus is much larger than the
filament radius.

<h3>When physics meets chemistry at dynamic glass transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
Can the laws of physics be unified. One of the most puzzling challenges is to
reconcile physics and chemistry, where molecular physics meets condensed-matter
physics, resulting from the scaling effect and dynamic fluctuation of glassy
matter at the glass transition temperature. Pioneer of condensed-matter
physics, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Philip Warren Anderson, wrote in
1995: The deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in condensed-matter
physics is probably the theory of the nature of glassy state and the glass
transition. In 2005, the question of 'what is the nature of glassy state' was
suggested as one of the greatest scientific conundrums over the next
quarter-century for Science's 125th anniversary. However, the nature of glassy
state and its connection to the glass transition have not been fully understood
owing to the interdisciplinary complexity of physics and chemistry, where they
are governed by the physical laws at condensed-matter and molecular scales,
respectively. Therefore, study on the glass transition becomes essential to
explore the working principles of scaling effect and dynamic fluctuation in
glassy matter, as well as further reconcile the interdisciplinary complexity of
physics and chemistry.

<br>
We study two-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) of flat polygons
and rounded squares aligned in parallel to find a transition in the asymptotic
behavior of the kinetics of packing growth. Differences in the kinetics for RSA
of disks and parallel squares were confirmed in previous analytical and
numerical reports. Here, by analyzing the two classes of shapes in question we
can precisely control the shape of packed figures and thus localize the
transition. Additionally, we study how the asymptotic properties of the
kinetics depend on the packing size. We also provide accurate estimations of
saturated packing fractions. The microstructural properties of generated
packings are analyzed in terms of the density autocorrelation function.

<br>
The electronic properties of graphene can be modified by the local
interaction with a selected metal substrate. To probe this effect, Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy is widely employed, particularly by means of local
measurement via lock-in amplifier of the differential conductance and of the
field emission resonance. In this article we propose an alternative, reliable
method of probing the graphene/substrate interaction that is readily available
to any STM apparatus. By testing the tunneling current as function of the
tip/sample distance on nanostructured graphene on Ni(100), we demonstrate that
I(z) spectroscopy can be quantitatively compared with Density Functional Theory
calculations and can be used to assess the nature of the interaction between
graphene and substrate. This method can expand the capabilities of standard STM
systems to study graphene/substrate complexes, complementing standard
topographic probing with spectroscopic information.

<h3>Design of linear block copolymers and ABC star terpolymers that produce  two length scales at phase separation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quasicrystals (materials with long range order but without the usual spatial
periodicity of crystals) were discovered in several soft matter systems in the
last twenty years. The stability of quasicrystals has been attributed to the
presence of two prominent length scales in a specific ratio, which is 1.93 for
the twelve-fold quasicrystals most commonly found in soft matter. We propose
design criteria for block copolymers such that quasicrystal-friendly length
scales emerge at the point of phase separation from a melt, basing our
calculations on the Random Phase Approximation. We consider two block copolymer
families: linear chains containing two different monomer types in blocks of
different lengths, and ABC star terpolymers. In all examples, we are able to
identify parameter windows with the two length scales having a ratio of 1.93.
The models that we consider that are simplest for polymer synthesis are, first,
a monodisperse A_L B A_S B melt and, second, a model based on random reactions
from a mixture of A_L, A_S and B chains: both feature the length scale ratio of
1.93 and should be relatively easy to synthesise.

<h3>Large upper critical fields and dimensionality crossover of  superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recently emerging superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, with
isostructure and isoelectron of cuprates, provides a new platform to explore
the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductors. In this work, we
studied the upper critical field ($H_{\rm{c2}}$) of a high-quality
La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$ thin film with superconducting transition
temperature, $T_{\rm{c}}$ = 18.8 K, using high magnetic field up to 56 T. A
very large $H_{\rm{c2}}$, $\sim$ 40 T for $H$ $\Arrowvert$ $c$ and $\sim$ 52 T
for $H$ $\Arrowvert$ $ab$, was confirmed, which suggests that infinite-layer
nickelates also have great application potential. The anisotropy of
$H_{\rm{c2}}$ monotonically decreases from $\sim$ 10 near $T_{\rm{c}}$ to
$\sim$ 1.5 at 2 K. Angle dependence of $H_{\rm{c2}}$ confirms the crossover of
superconductivity from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as the
temperature decreases. We discussed that the interstitial orbital effect causes
the weakening of anisotropy. The observed abnormal upturning of $H_{\rm{c2}}$
at low temperatures is found to be a universal behavior independent of film
quality and rare earth elements. Therefore, it should not be the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state due to the fact that it is in the
dirty limit and insensitive to disorder.

A rotating organic cation and a dynamically disordered soft inorganic cage
are the hallmark features of hybrid organic-inorganic lead-halide perovskites.
Understanding the interplay between these two subsystems is a challenging
problem but it is this coupling that is widely conjectured to be responsible
for the unique behaviour of photo-carriers in these materials. In this work, we
use the fact that the polarizability of the organic cation strongly depends on
the ambient electrostatic environment to put the molecule forward as a
sensitive probe of local crystal fields inside the lattice cell. We measure the
average polarizability of the C/N--H bond stretching mode by means of infrared
spectroscopy, which allows us to deduce the character of the motion of the
cation molecule, find the magnitude of the local crystal field and place an
estimate on the strength of the hydrogen bond between the hydrogen and halide
atoms. Our results pave the way for understanding electric fields in
lead-halide perovskites using infrared bond spectroscopy.

<h3>Does Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Occur in Periodically Driven  Low-Dimensional Non-Equilibrium Classical Systems?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14235" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14235</a>
<br>
<i>Harukuni Ikeda, Yuta Kuroda</i>
<br>
<br>
In one and two dimensions, equilibrium systems with continuous degrees of
freedom do not show the spontaneous symmetry breaking, as the thermal
fluctuation destroys the long-range orders. The simplest way to suppress
fluctuations and realize the long-range orders in low-dimensional systems is
just to consider the ground state at zero temperature. A less trivial example
is an out-of-equilibrium system driven by periodic driving forces, instead of
thermal agitation. If the amplitude of the driving force is sufficiently small,
the periodic force of frequency $\omega_0$ only excites the eigenmode of the
eigenfrequency $\omega_0$. Therefore, the fluctuations would be largely
suppressed even near the critical point, if it exists. Does this mechanism
allows the spontaneous symmetry breaking in low dimensions? We here show that
the answer is positive, at least for the spherical model, which corresponds to
the large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ model and allows us to analytically calculate
the lower critical dimension $d_l$. For that purpose, we here propose the
driving force inspired by the chiral active matter:
$h(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\sqrt{2D}\cos\theta(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, where
$\dot{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\omega_0+\xi(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, and
$\xi(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ denotes the white noise. For the finite strength of the
noise, the model undergoes the second-order ferromagnetic phase transition at
some finite $D=D_c$. In particular, the lower critical dimension is $d_l=2$,
meaning that the ordered phase does not appear for $d\leq d_l=2$. In the
absence of the noise, on the contrary, the model undergoes the ferromagnetic
phase transition for any $d>0$, namely, $d_l=0$. Furthermore, the model for the
conserved order parameter exhibits the hyperuniformity in the absence of the
noise, which has been previously reported for chiral active matter.

<h3>Charge Stripe Manipulation of Superconducting Pairing Symmetry  Transition</h3>

One of the major differences between superconducting cuprates and nickelates
is that $d$-wave is dominated in cuprates, while both $s$- and $d$-waves are
observed in nickelates. This raises a strong puzzle on its origin, although
these two systems exhibit similar structural and electronic characteristics. To
solve this puzzle, we have investigated an inhomogeneous Hubbard model on a
square lattice using the quantum Monte Carlo method. Surprisingly, we discover
that period of charge stripe $\mathcal{P}$, differing in cuprates and
nickelates, plays an unexpected role in determining the emergence of distinct
pairing symmetries. While the $d$-wave is dominated for $\mathcal{P} \ge 4$
(the cases for cuprates), both $s$- and $d$-wave can appear when $\mathcal{P}<
4$. Taking $\mathcal{P}=3$ as the case for nickelates, we discover that the
interplay between hole-doping concentration $\delta$ and charge-stripe
amplitude $V_0$ can realize a remarkable $d$-$s$ wave transition. It originates
from the $V_0$-modulated charge inhomogeneity between the on-stripe and
inter-stripe region, which is stronger in a smaller $\mathcal{P}$ system,
forming an interesting selection rule for the preferred pairing symmetry.
Interestingly, accompanied by the $d$-$s$ wave transition, there is a novel
magnetic-correlation transition, indicating the inherent intercoupling between
charge stripe, superconducting pairing, and magnetic correlation. In general,
our non-biased simulations provide a new insight into the difference of
superconducting pairing mechanism between nickelates and cuprates, highlighting
the decisive role of charge stripe.

We analyze the nature of the modulated magnetic states in a micromagnetic
model for the monoaxial chiral magnet MnNb$_3$S$_6$ for which the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the dipolar interaction compete evenly.
We show that the interplay between these interactions lead to a complex phase
diagram including ferromagnetic states, fan-like states, in-plane stripes
patterns and chiral soliton lattices. In particular, stripe patterns and chiral
soliton lattices comprise non-trivial topological states with fixed chirality.
The obtained phase diagram exhibits strong dependency on the thickness and on
the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our results can help to
understand the magnetic properties of systems such as MnNb$_3$S$_6$.

The structural properties of confined single-file hard-disk fluids are
studied analytically by means of a mapping of the original system onto a
one-dimensional mixture of non-additive hard rods, which is exact in the
polydisperse limit. Standard statistical-mechanical results are used as a
starting point to derive thermodynamic and structural properties of the
one-dimensional mixture, where the condition that all particles have the same
chemical potential must be taken into account. Analytical results are then
provided for the $n$th neighbor probability distribution function, the radial
distribution function, and the structure factor. Comparison with simulation

Recent advances regarding the interplay between ab initio calculations and
metrology are reviewed, with particular emphasis on gas-based techniques used
for temperature and pressure measurements. Since roughly 2010, several
thermophysical quantities - in particular, virial and transport coefficients -
can be computed from first principles without uncontrolled approximations and
with rigorously propagated uncertainties. In the case of helium, computational
results have accuracies that exceed the best experimental data by at least one
order of magnitude and are suitable to be used in primary metrology. The
availability of ab initio virial and transport coefficients contributed to the
recent SI definition of temperature by facilitating measurements of the
Boltzmann constant with unprecedented accuracy. Presently, they enable the
development of primary standards of temperature in the range 2.5-552 K and
pressure up to 7 MPa using acoustic gas thermometry, dielectric constant gas
thermometry, and refractive index gas thermometry. These approaches will be
reviewed, highlighting the effect of first-principles data on their accuracy.
The recent advances in electronic structure calculations that enabled highly
accurate solutions for the many-body interaction potentials and
polarizabilities of atoms - particularly helium - will be described, together
with the subsequent computational methods, most often based on quantum
statistical mechanics and its path-integral formulation, that provide
thermophysical properties and their uncertainties. Similar approaches for
molecular systems, and their applications, are briefly discussed. Current
limitations and expected future lines of research are assessed.

<br>
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous
scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological
behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS2, even though selenides and
tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, we
describe an innovative in-operando conversion of Se nano-powders into
lubricious 2D selenides by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces
coated with Mo and W thin films. Advanced material characterization confirms
the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing
the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically
reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in
shear-induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nano-powders. The use of Se
nano-powder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum
environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nano-powder with the
transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface
yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the
replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the
long-lasting problem of TMD-lubricity degradation caused by environmental
molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an
unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs in-operando and exploit their
friction- and wear reducing impact.

We demonstrate the existence and study in detail the features of chiral
bimerons which are static solutions in an easy-plane magnet with the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. These are skyrmionic textures with an
integer topological charge and they present essential analogies to the meron
configurations introduced in the context of quark confinement in the O(3)
nonlinear sigma-model. We employ a Moebius transformation to show that, for
weak chirality, bimeron configurations approach Belavin-Polyakov (BP) solutions
characterized by tightly bound vortex and antivortex parts of the same size.
Stronger chirality induces different vortex and antivortex sizes and also a
detachment of merons, suggesting the possibility for a topological phase
transition. Exploiting the fact that bimerons of opposite topological charges
may exist in the same material, we demonstrate numerically a mechanism to
generate meron pairs.

Motivated by the possible applications that a better understanding of
consciousness might bring, we follow Tononi's idea and calculate analytically a
complexity index for two systems of Ising spins with parallel update dynamics,
the homogeneous and a modular infinite range models. Using the information
geometry formulation of integrated information theory, we calculate the
geometric integrated information index, $\phi_G(\Pi)$ for a fixed partition
$\Pi$ with $K$ components and $\Phi=$max$_\Pi\phi_G(\Pi)$ for $K=2$ or $3$. For
systems in the deep ferromagnetic phase, the optimal partition undergoes a
transition such that the smallest (largest) component is above (resp. below)
its critical temperature. The effects of partitioning are taken into account by
introducing site dilution.

The remagnetization process after ultrafast demagnetization can be described
by relaxation mechanisms between the spin, electron, and lattice reservoirs.
Thereby, collective spin excitations in form of spin waves and their angular
momentum transfer play an important role on the longer timescales. In this
work, we address the question whether the strength of demagnetization affects
the coherency and the phase of the excited spin waves. We present a study of
coherent magnetization dynamics in thin nickel films after ultrafast
demagnetization using the all-optical, time-resolved magneto-optical
Kerr-effect (tr-MOKE) technique. The largest coherent oscillation amplitude was
observed for strongly quenched systems, showing the conservation of coherency
for demagnetizations of up to 90%. Moreover, the phase of the excited
spin-waves increases with pump power, indicating a delayed start of the
precession during the remagnetization.

Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations have served as a paradigmatic
experimental probe and tool for extracting key semiconductor parameters such as
carrier density, effective mass, Zeeman splitting with g-factor $g^*$, quantum
scattering times and spin-orbit (SO) coupling parameters. Here, we derive for
the first time an analytical formulation for the SdH oscillations in 2D
electron gases (2DEGs) with simultaneous Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Zeeman
interactions. Our analytical and numerical calculations allow us to extract
both Rashba and Dresselhaus SO coupling parameters, carrier density, quantum
lifetimes, and also to understand the role of higher harmonics in the SdH
oscillations. More importantly, we derive a simple condition for the vanishing
of SO induced SdH beatings for all harmonics in 2DEGs: $\alpha/\beta=
[(1-\tilde \Delta)/(1+\tilde \Delta)]^{1/2}$, where $\tilde \Delta$ is a
material parameter given by the ratio of the Zeeman and Landau level splitting.
We also predict beatings in the higher harmonics of the SdH oscillations and
elucidate the inequivalence of the SdH response of Rashba-dominated
($\alpha>\beta$) vs Dresselhaus-dominated ($\alpha<\beta$) 2DEGs in
semiconductors with substantial $g^*$. We find excellent agreement with recent
available experimental data of Dettwiler ${\it et\thinspace al.}$ Phys. Rev. X

Intracrystalline diffusion is an invaluable tool for estimating timescales of
geological events. Diffusion is typically modeled using gradients in chemical
potential. However, chemical potential is derived for constant pressure and
temperature conditions and therefore cannot be used to model diffusion when
pressure is not constant. Internal stress variations in minerals create
gradients in strain energy which will drive diffusion. Consequently, it is
necessary to have a method that incorporates stress variations into diffusion
models. We derive a flux expression that allows diffusion to be modeled in
ionic, crystalline solids under arbitrary stress states. Our derivation
utilizes gradients in a thermodynamic potential called relative chemical
potential which quantifies changes in free energy due to the exchanges of
constituents on lattice sites under arbitrary stress conditions. We apply our
derivation to the common quaternary garnet solid solution
almandine-pyrope-grossular-spessartine. The rates and directions of divalent
cation diffusion in response to stress are determined by endmember molar volume
or lattice parameters, elastic moduli, and non-ideal activity interaction
parameters. Our results predict that internal stress variations of one hundred
MPa or more are required to shift garnet compositions by at least a few
hundredths of a mole fraction. Mineral inclusions in garnet present a potential
environment to test and apply our stress-driven diffusion approach, as stress
variations ranging from hundreds of MPa to GPa-level are observed or predicted
around such inclusions. The ability to model stress-induced diffusion may
provide new information about the magnitudes of both intracrystalline stresses
and the timescales during which they occurred, imparting a better understanding
of large-scale tectono-metamorphic processes.

We investigate the elastic properties of anisotropic elastomers with a
double-twist director field, which is a model for collagen fibrils or blue
phases. We observe a significant Poynting effect, coupling torsion (fibril
twist) and extension. For freely-rotating boundary conditions, we identify a
structural bistability at very small extensional strains which undergoes a
saddle-node bifurcation at a critical strain -- at approximately 1% strain for
a parameterization appropriate for collagen fibrils. With clamped boundary
conditions appropriate for many experimental setups, the bifurcation is not
present. We expect significant helical shape effects due to residual torques
when fixed torsion does not equal the equilibrium torsion of freely-rotating
boundary conditions.

Molecular adsorption is the first important step of many surface-mediated
chemical processes, from catalysis to tribology. This phenomenon is controlled
by physical/chemical interactions, which can be accurately described by first
principles calculations. In recent years, several computational tools have been
developed to study molecular adsorption based on high throughput/automatized
approaches. However, these tools can sometimes be over-sophisticated for
non-expert users. In this work, we present Xsorb, a Python-based code that
automatically generates adsorption configurations, guides the user in the
identification the most relevant ones, which are then fully optimized. The code
relies on well-established Python libraries, and on an open source package for
density functional theory calculations. We show the program capabilities
through an example consisting of a hydrocarbon molecule, 1-hexene, adsorbed
over the (110) surface of iron. The presented computational tool will help
users, even non-expert, to easily identify the most stable adsorption
configuration of complex molecules on substrates and obtain accurate adsorption
geometries and energies.

We study the relaxation dynamics of laser-excited non-equilibrium electron
distributions in the valence- and conduction band of a dielectric. We apply
Boltzmann collision integrals to trace the influence of different scattering
mechanisms on the energy- and particle density of electrons and holes. Our
results show a two-timescale behavior of the equilibration process:
Thermalization within each band towards a respective Fermi distribution as well
as equilibration of the band-resolved temperatures occur within a few
femtoseconds. In contrast, the equilibration of the respective chemical
potentials, driven by scattering processes involving particle exchange like
impact ionization and Auger recombination, requires timescales in the range of
hundreds of femtoseconds. We evaluate the effect of our model assumptions for
distinct material parameters on the extracted specific relaxation times. All
these timescales, however, strongly increase, when the additional scattering
channel with the cold phonon system is considered: Our simulations demonstrate
that an athermal non-Fermi electron distribution can be maintained well up to
the picosecond range.

High throughput first-principles calculations, based on solving the quantum
mechanical many-body problem for hundreds of materials in parallel, have been
successfully applied to advance many materials-based technologies, from
batteries to hydrogen storage. However, this approach has not yet been adopted
to systematically study solid-solid interfaces and their tribological
properties. To this aim, we developed TribChem, an advanced software based on
the FireWorks platform, which is here presented. TribChem is constructed in a
modular way, allowing for the separate calculation of bulk, surface, and
interface properties. At present the calculated interfacial properties include
adhesion, shear strength, and charge redistribution. Further properties can be
easily added due to the general structure of the main workflow.

The sphinx tile, a hexiamond composed of six equilateral triangles in the
shape of a sphinx, has interesting and complex tiling behavior due to its
chirality and asymmetry. It can be tiled in quasicrystal 'rep-tiles' of order
$2^n$, but also in more complex and disordered tilings within sphinx frames of
all orders. For frames up to order 13 we carry out exact enumeration using
'accelerated backtracking,' 'seam,' and 'dangler' algorithms to find the number
of tilings, while for larger frames we introduce a Monte-Carlo (MC) method to
create randomized tilings. Key to the latter is the identification of
fundamental shapes ('polyads') that have multiple tilings and allow a
rejection-free MC move once the polyad is identified. We also introduce a
chiral interaction energy and study how the system behaves as a function of
temperature; at low temperatures, chiral ordering is found.
