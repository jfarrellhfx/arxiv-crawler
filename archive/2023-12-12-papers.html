<h3>Emergent Gauge Symmetry in Active Brownian Matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07283</a>
<br>
<i>Nathan O. Silvano, Daniel G. Barci</i>
<p>We investigate a two-dimensional system of Active Brownian Particles at
finite density. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis formalism, we
built up the generating functional for correlation functions. We study in
detail the hydrodynamic regime with a constant density stationary state. Our
findings reveal that, within a small density fluctuations regime, an emergent
$U(1)$ gauge symmetry arises, originated from the conservation of fluid
vorticity. Consequently, the interaction between the orientational order
parameter and density fluctuations can be cast into a gauge theory, where the
concept of ``electric charge density" aligns with the local vorticity of the
original fluid. We study in detail the case of a microscopic local two-body
interaction. We show that, upon integrating out the gauge fields, the
stationary states of the rotational degrees of freedom satisfy a non-local
Frank free energy. We give explicit expressions for the splay and bend elastic
constants as a function of the P\'eclet number (${\rm Pe}$) and the diffusion
interaction constant ($k_d$).

<p>With the rapid development of studies involving droplet microfluidics, drug
delivery, cell detection, and microparticle synthesis, among others, many
scientists have invested significant efforts to model the flow of these
fluid-filled bodies. Motivated by the intricate coupling between hydrodynamics
and the interactions of fluid-filled bodies, several methods have been
developed. The objective of this review is to present a compact foundation of
the methods used in the literature in the context of lattice Boltzmann methods.
For hydrodynamics, we focus on the lattice-Boltzmann method due to its specific
ability to treat time and spatial-dependent boundary conditions and to
incorporate new physical models in a computationally efficient way. We split
the existing methods into two groups with regard to the interfacial boundary:
fluid-structure and fluid-fluid methods. The fluid-structure methods are
characterised by the coupling between fluid dynamics and mechanics of the
flowing body, often used in applications involving membranes and similar
flexible solid boundaries. We further divide fluid-structure-based methods into
two subcategories, those which treat the fluid-structure boundary as a
continuum medium and those that treat it as a discrete collection of individual
springs and particles. Next, we discuss the fluid-fluid methods, particularly
useful for the simulations of fluid-fluid interfaces. We focus on models for
immiscible droplets and their interaction in a suspending fluid and describe
benchmark tests to validate the models for fluid-filled bodies.

<h3>Features of synthesis of TbCr$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ single crystals by  solution-melt method</h3>

<i>I.A. Gudim, N.V. Mikhashenok</i>
<p>The phase formation of terbium chromium borate in melt solutions based on
bismuth trimolybdate and lithium tungstate was studied. It was shown that there
is no trigonal phase of terbium chromium borate in a system based on bismuth
trimolybdate at all component ratios. The ratio of components of a system based
on lithium tungstate has been found, at which trigonal TbCr$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$
crystals are formed at temperatures above 1100$^\circ$C, and below this
temperature only a monoclinic phase is formed. The X-ray properties of the
grown crystals were studied.

<h3>Strong disorder and transport in strange metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06751" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06751</a>
<br>
<i>Aavishkar A. Patel, Peter Lunts, Subir Sachdev</i>
<p>A recent theory described strange metal behavior in a model of a Fermi
surface coupled a two-dimensional quantum critical scalar field with a
spatially random Yukawa coupling. With the assumption of self-averaging
randomness, similar to that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, numerous observed
properties of a strange metal were obtained for wide range of intermediate
temperatures, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity. The Harris
criterion implies that spatial fluctuations in the local position of the
critical point must dominate at low temperatures, and these were not fully
accounted for in the recent theory. We use multiple graphics processing units
to compute the real frequency spectrum of the scalar propagator in several
random realizations, assuming Landau-damping from the fermions, and a spatially
random mass. We find behavior consistent with the emergence of the physics of
the random transverse-field Ising model, as has been proposed by Hoyos,
Kotabage, and Vojta. This emergent low temperature regime, controlled by
localized overdamped eigenmodes of the scalar field, also has a resistivity
which is nearly linear-in-temperature, and extends into a `quantum critical
phase' away from the quantum critical point, as observed in several cuprates.

<h3>Non-constant geometric curvature for tailored spin-orbit coupling and  chirality in superconductor-magnet heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<i>Alv Johan Skarpeid, Henning G. Hugdal, Tancredi Salamone, Morten Amundsen, Sol H. Jacobsen</i>
<p>We show that tailoring the geometric curvature profile of magnets can be used
for bespoke design of an effective non-relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which
may be used to control proximity effects if the magnet is coupled to a
superconductor. We consider proximity-coupled one-dimensional magnetic wires
with variable curvatures, specifically three distinct shapes classified as J-,
C-, and S-type. We demonstrate a chirality-dependent spin polarization of the
superconducting correlations, and show the role of curvature in determining the
ground state of mixed-chirality junctions. We speculate on how this may be
implemented in novel device design, and include analysis of its usage in a
spin-triplet SQUID

<h3>Fingerprints of Composite Fermion Lambda Levels in Scanning Tunneling  Microscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06779" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06779</a>
<br>
<i>Songyang Pu, Ajit C. Balram, Yuwen Hu, Yen-Chen Tsui, Minhao He, Nicolas Regnault, Michael P. Zaletel, Ali Yazdani, Zlatko Papić</i>
<p>Composite fermion (CF) is a topological quasiparticle that emerges from a
non-perturbative attachment of vortices to electrons in strongly correlated
two-dimensional materials. Similar to non-interacting fermions that form Landau
levels in a magnetic field, CFs can fill analogous ``Lambda'' levels, giving
rise to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect of electrons. Here, we show
that Lambda levels can be directly visualized through the characteristic peak
structure in the signal obtained via spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) on a FQH state. Complementary to transport, which probes
low-energy properties of CFs, we show that \emph{high-energy} features in STM
spectra can be interpreted in terms of Lambda levels. We numerically
demonstrate that STM spectra can be accurately modeled using Jain's CF theory.
Our results show that STM provides a powerful tool for revealing the anatomy of
FQH states and identifying physics beyond the non-interacting CF paradigm.

<h3>Features of nanocontact formed using point electrical breakdown of a  niobium oxide nanolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06816" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06816</a>
<br>
<i>S.I. Bondarenko, A.V. Krevsun, V.P. Koverya</i>
<p>The electrical characteristics of a point section of niobium oxide between a
massive cathode made of a superconducting indium-tin alloy and a niobium film
before the oxide breakdown and the nanocontact that appears after the breakdown
of the oxide at room temperature have been studied. The dependences of the
point breakdown voltage of the oxide and the resistance of nanocontacts on the
method of breakdown and the thickness of the oxide in the range of 15-60 nm
have been established. In particular, a minimum value of the breakdown current
has been established (about 1 {\mu}A), below which breakdown does not occur.
The voltage-current characteristic (VCC) of the oxide has a semiconductor
character and indicates the dependence of the breakdown voltage of the oxide on
its polarity. The VCC of the nanocontact is nonlinear, which is associated with
phase transitions in the nanocontact material caused by its heating by the
transport current.

<h3>Experimental verification of the inverse Anomalous spin Hall effect with  perpendicular magnetic anisotropy Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06819</a>
<br>
<i>J. E. Abrão, A. R. Rodrigues, H. F. Ding, S. Bedanta, A. Azevedo</i>
<p>In this work, the spin pumping technique was employed to investigate the
anomalous inverse spin Hall effect in BIG/NiO/Fe samples where
BIG[(Bi,Tm)3(Fe,Ga)5O12] exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our
results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: when the magnetizations of both
ferromagnetic layers align perpendicularly, a distinct spin-to-charge current
conversion mechanism occurs. This conversion is intricately linked to the
magnetization of the converting layer, spin polarization, and the spin current
orientation.

<h3>In situ X-ray scattering reveals coarsening rates of superlattices  self-assembled from electrostatically stabilized metal nanocrystals depend  non-monotonically on driving force</h3>

<i>Christian P. N. Tanner, James K. Utterback, Joshua Portner, Igor Coropceanu, Avishek Das, Christopher J. Tassone, Samuel W. Teitelbaum, David T. Limmer, Dmitri V. Talapin, Naomi S. Ginsberg</i>
<p>Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into superlattices (SLs) is an
appealing strategy to design hierarchically organized materials with new
functionalities. Mechanistic studies are still needed to uncover the design
principles for SL self-assembly, but such studies have been difficult to
perform due to the fast time- and short length scales of NC systems. To address
this challenge, we developed an apparatus to directly measure the evolving
phases \textit{in situ} and in real time of an electrostatically stabilized Au
NC solution before, during, and after it is quenched to form SLs using small
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). By developing a quantitative model, we fit the
time-dependent scattering patterns to obtain the phase diagram of the system
and the kinetics of the colloidal and SL phases as a function of varying quench
conditions. The extracted phase diagram is consistent with particles whose
interactions are short in range relative to their diameter. We find the degree
of SL order is primarily determined by fast (sub-second) initial nucleation and
growth kinetics, while coarsening at later times depends non-monotonically on
the driving force for self-assembly. We validate these results by direct
comparison with simulations and use them to suggest dynamic design principles
to optimize crystallinity within a finite time window. The combination of this
measurement methodology, quantitative analysis, and simulation should be
generalizable to elucidate and better control the microscopic self-assembly
pathways of a wide range of bottom-up assembled systems and architectures.

<h3>Exploring Metamagnetism in Triangular Ising Networks: Insights from  Further-Neighbor Interactions with a Case Study on ErGa2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06859" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06859</a>
<br>
<i>Po-Hao Chang, Igor I. Mazin</i>
<p>The classical Ising model on the triangular lattice (we will call it I-3
model below), while simple in the nearest-neighbors (NN) only approximation,
becomes increasingly richer and more complex when further interactions are
incorporated. However, the studies so far have not been exhaustive, nor have
any attempts been made to estimate how realistic are the parameter ranges that
generate strong metamagnetism with a large number of magnetization steps. In
this study, we identify one such candidate, ErGa$_{2}$, a material known to
have one strong magnetization step, albeit some narrow steps below and above
cannot be confidently excluded. It has been established, and we can confirm the
same computationally, to have an easy axis perpendicular to the triangular Er
plane, with a strong anisotropy and with a large magnetic moment of
$9.5\:\mu_{B}$, making it a perfect implementation of the classical I-3 model.
In the first part of the analysis, we present the I-3 model with up to the
third nearest-neighbors in a range of parameters $J_{2}$ and $J_{3}$ ($J_{1}$
in this part is set to 1), and in some cases adding a rather small $J_{4}$ in
order to reveal new phases otherwise degenerate with some others. The richest
phase diagram is, not surprisingly, observed when all interactions are
antiferromagnetic (AF). Subsequently, a more realistic case, inspired by RKKY
and by our calculations for ErGa$_{2}$, where $J_{1},J_{2}>0$
(antiferromagnetic) and $J_{3},J_{4}<0$ (ferromagnetic), is presented. Finally,
we report our first-principles calculations of $J_{1-4}$ in ErGa$_{2}$ and
compared the phase diagram in the regime corresponding to the calculated values
with the experiment.

<h3>Stroboscopic X-ray Diffraction Microscopy of Dynamic Strain in Diamond  Thin-film Bulk Acoustic Resonators for Quantum Control of Nitrogen Vacancy  Centers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06862</a>
<br>
<i>Anthony D'Addario, Johnathan Kuan, Noah F. Opondo, Ozan Erturk, Tao Zhou, Sunil A. Bhave, Martin V. Holt, Gregory D. Fuchs</i>
<p>Bulk-mode acoustic waves in a crystalline material exert lattice strain
through the thickness of the sample, which couples to the spin Hamiltonian of
defect-based qubits such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center defect in diamond.
This mechanism has been previously harnessed for unconventional quantum spin
control, spin decoherence protection, and quantum sensing. Bulk-mode acoustic
wave devices are also important in the microelectronics industry as microwave
filters. A key challenge in both applications is a lack of appropriate operando
microscopy tools for quantifying and visualizing gigahertz-frequency dynamic
strain. In this work, we directly image acoustic strain within NV
center-coupled diamond thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonators using
stroboscopic scanning hard X-ray diffraction microscopy at the Advanced Photon
Source. The far-field scattering patterns of the nano-focused X-ray diffraction
encode strain information entirely through the illuminated thickness of the
resonator. These patterns have a real-space spatial variation that is
consistent with the bulk strain's expected modal distribution and a
momentum-space angular variation from which the strain amplitude can be
quantitatively deduced. We also perform optical measurements of strain-driven
Rabi precession of the NV center spin ensemble, providing an additional
quantitative measurement of the strain amplitude. As a result, we directly
measure the NV spin-stress coupling parameter $b = 2.73(2)$ MHz/GPa by
correlating these measurements at the same spatial position and applied
microwave power. Our results demonstrate a unique technique for directly
imaging AC lattice strain in micromechanical structures and provide a direct
measurement of a fundamental constant for the NV center defect spin
Hamiltonian.

<h3>Memory-based involution dilemma on square lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06912" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06912</a>
<br>
<i>Chaochao Huang, Chaoqian Wang</i>
<p>When involution affects individuals, their efforts do not augment resources
but merely compete for limited resources. From entrance exams to company
overtime, such efforts lead to unnecessary costs, undermining group welfare.
Meanwhile, the individual advantages or collective disadvantages from this
unnecessary effort may accumulate over time, such as the long-term validity of
test scores. To identify the role of this memory factor, we propose a
memory-based involution game model. In a more competitive environment, our
findings suggest: (i) with scant social resources, increasing memory length
curbs involution, (ii) with moderate resources, increasing memory length
initially intensifies involution but later reduces it, and (iii) with abundant
social resources, increasing memory length amplifies involution. Conversely, in
a less competitive environment, involution consistently decreases with a larger
memory length. Our research provides insights into mitigating involution by
considering memory effects.

<h3>Interacting Floquet topological magnons in laser-irradiated Heisenberg  honeycomb ferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06929</a>
<br>
<i>Hongchao Shi, Heng Zhu, Bing Tang, Chao Yang</i>
<p>When a Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnet is irradiated by high frequency
circularly polarized light, the underlying uncharged magnons acquire a time
dependent Aharonov Casher phase, which makes it a Floquet topological magnon
insulator. In this context, we investigate the many body interaction effects of
Floquet magnons in laser irradiated Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnets with
ocontaining Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction under the application of
circularly polarized off resonant light. We demonstrate that the quantum
ferromagnet systems periodically laser driven exhibits temperature driven
topological phase transitions due to Floquet magnon magnon interactions. The
thermal Hall effect of Floquet magnons serves as a prominent signature for
detecting these many body effects near the critical point, enabling
experimental investigation into this phenomenon. Our study complements the lack
of previous theoretical works that the topological phase transition of the
Floquet magnon under the linear spin wave approximation is only tunable by the
light field. Our study presents a novel approach for constructing Floquet
topological phases in periodically driven quantum magnet systems that goes
beyond the limitations of the linear spin wave theory. We provide numerical
results based on the well known van der Waals quantum magnet CrX3 (X=F, Cl, Br,
and I), calling for experimental implementation.

<h3>Kondo coherence versus superradiance in THz radiation-driven  heavy-fermion systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06931</a>
<br>
<i>Chia-Jung Yang, Michael Woerner, Oliver Stockert, Hilbert v. Loehneysen, Johann Kroha, Manfred Fiebig, Shovon Pal</i>
<p>In strongly correlated systems such as heavy-fermion materials, the coherent
superposition of localized and mobile spin states leads to the formation of
Kondo resonant states, which on a dense, periodic array of Kondo ions develop
lattice coherence. Characteristically, these quantum-coherent superposition
states respond to a terahertz (THz) excitation by a delayed THz pulse on the
scale of the material's Kondo energy scale and, hence, independent of the
pump-light intensity. However, delayed response is also typical for
superradiance in an ensemble of excited atoms. In this case, quantum coherence
is established by the coupling to an external, electromagnetic mode and, hence,
dependent on the pump-light intensity. In the present work, we investigate the
physical origin of the delayed pulse, i.e., inherent, correlation-induced
versus light-induced coherence, in the prototypical heavy-fermion compound
CeCu_5.9Au_0.1. We study the delay, duration and amplitude of the THz pulse at
various temperatures in dependence on the electric-field strength of the
incident THz excitation, ranging from 0.3 to 15.2 kV/cm. We observe a robust
delayed response at approximately 6 ps with an amplitude proportional to the
amplitude of the incident THz wave. This is consistent with theoretical
expectation for the Kondo-like coherence and thus provides compelling evidence
for the dominance of condensed-matter versus optical coherence in the
heavy-fermion compound.

<h3>Re-understanding of the deformation potential constant in the single  crystal silicon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06954</a>
<br>
<i>Feng Sun, Aijun Hong</i>
<p>The mobility formula based on deformation potential (DP) theory is of great
importance in semiconductor physics. However, the related calculations for the
DP constant are controversial. It is necessary to redo in-depth and
comprehensive research on the mobility of single crystal silicon and the
related parameters such as the effective mass and the DP constant. In this work
the conductivity effective mass is redefined and a method based on the first
principles is presented to evaluate the correction of the DP constant. It is
found that the effective mass is closer to experimental data and the correction
of the DP is a negligible value of about 0.3 eV. Using these parameters, we
obtain the mobilities of the single crystal silicon in reasonable agreement
with the experimental values. Our method can be effectively applied to the
prediction for the mobility in bulk materials.

<h3>Enhanced ionic conductivity through crystallization of  glass-Li$_3$PS$_4$ by machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06963" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06963</a>
<br>
<i>Koji Shimizu, Parth Bahuguna, Shigeo Mori, Akitoshi Hayashi, Satoshi Watanabe</i>
<p>Understanding the atomistic mechanism of ion conduction in solid electrolytes
is critical for the advancement of all-solid-state batteries. Glass-ceramics,
which undergo crystallization from a glass state, frequently exhibit unique
properties including enhanced ionic conductivities compared to both the
original crystalline and glass forms. Despite these distinctive features,
specific details regarding the behavior of ion conduction in glass-ceramics,
particularly concerning conduction pathways, remain elusive. In this study, we
demonstrate the crystallization process of glass-Li$_3$PS$_4$ through molecular
dynamics simulations employing machine learning interatomic potentials
constructed from first principles calculation data. Our analyses of Li
conduction using the obtained partially crystallized structures reveal that the
diffusion barriers of Li decrease as the crystallinity in Li$_3$PS$_4$
glass-ceramics increases. Furthermore, Li displacements predominantly occur in
the precipitated crystalline portion, suggesting that percolation conduction
plays a significant role in enhanced Li conduction. These findings provide
valuable insights for the future utilization of glass-ceramic materials.

<h3>Bulk Photovoltaic Effects in Helimagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06977</a>
<br>
<i>Chunmei Zhang, Jian Zhou</i>
<p>The bulk photovoltaic (BPV) effect that converts light into electric current
is highly sensitive to the system symmetry and its electronic Bloch
wavefunction. To create a sizable net electric current, it is necessary to
break the centrosymmetry P in its host material. Here, we investigate how
helical spin polarization breaks P that is otherwise kept in its crystalline
geometry. The magnetic helix widely exists in multiferroics and magnon
excitation in collinear magnets. We apply symmetry analysis and a tight-binding
model to show how the symmetry is reduced in helimagnetic platforms under
various degrees of freedom, namely, different types of spin spiral
configurations, spin winding angles, magnetic propagation vectors, and spin
chirality. They offer effective and versatile manipulation of BPV generation in
helimagnets. Our concept is further illustrated in the monolayer NiI2, a
typical helimagnetic material. It could host observable direction-dependent BPV
current, which serves as an opto-electric probe to track the subtle magnetic
configurations and potential ferroic nature. Our work reveals the fundamental
mechanism of the multiferroic order and the nonlinear optics process.

<h3>Residual Stress-Driven Non-Euclidean Morphing in Origami Structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06982" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06982</a>
<br>
<i>Zihe Liang, Sibo Chai, Qinyun Ding, Kai Xiao, Ke Liu, Jiayao Ma, Jaehyung Ju</i>
<p>Non-Euclidean surfaces are ubiquitous in numerous engineering fields, such as
automotive, aerospace, and biomedical engineering domains. Morphing origami has
numerous potential engineering applications, including soft robots, mechanical
metamaterials, antennas, aerospace structures, and biomedical devices, owing to
its intrinsic morphing features from two-dimensional (2D) planes to
three-dimensional (3D) surfaces. However, the current one-dimensional (1D)
hinge deformation-driven transformation of foldable origami with rigid or
slightly deformable panels cannot achieve a 3D complex and large curvilinear
morphing. Moreover, most active origami structures use thin hinges with soft
materials on their creases, thus resulting in a lower load capability. This
study proposes a novel origami morphing method that demonstrates large
free-form surface morphing, e.g., Euclidean to non-Euclidean surface morphing
with shape-locking. We embedded tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels
during the extrusion-based 3D printing of shape memory polymers. The
extrusion-based 3D printing of isotropic shape memory polymers can produce
tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels during fabrication, which can
realize large non-Euclidean surface morphing with multiple deformation modes.
The connecting topology of the origami unit cells influences the global
morphing behavior owing to the interaction of the deformation of adjacent
panels. Non-Euclidean morphing integrated with four-dimensional (4D) printing
can provide multimodal shape locking at material and structural levels. The
non-Euclidean surface morphing caused by tensorial residual stress in the panel
during 3D printing expands the design space of origami and kirigami structures.

<h3>Shape-dependent motility of polar inclusions in active baths</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06997" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06997</a>
<br>
<i>Pritha Dolai, Aditya Singh Rajput, K. Vijay Kumar</i>
<p>Collections of persistently moving active particles are an example of a
nonequilibrium heat bath. One way to study the nature of nonequilibrium
fluctuations in such systems is to follow the dynamics of an embedded probe
particle. With this aim, we study the dynamics of an anisotropic inclusion
embedded in a bath of active particles. By studying various statistical
correlation functions of the dynamics, we show that the emergent motility of
this inclusion depends on its shape as well as the properties of the active
bath. We demonstrate that both the decorrelation time of the net force on the
inclusion and the dwell time of bath particles in a geometrical trap on the
inclusion have a non-monotonic dependence on its shape. We also find that the
motility of the inclusion is optimal when the volume fraction of the active
bath is close to the value for the onset of motility induced phase separation.

<p>We report intriguing and hitherto overlooked low-field room temperature
extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) patterns in graphene/hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) superlattices that emerge due to the existence of open orbits
within each miniband. This finding is set against the backdrop of the
experimental discovery of the Hofstadter butterfly in moir superlattices, which
has sparked considerable interest in the fractal quantum Hall regime. To cope
with the challenge of deciphering the low magnetic field dynamics of moir
minibands, we utilize a novel semi-classical calculation method, grounded in
zero-field Fermi contours, to predict the nontrivial behavior of the
Landau-level spectrum. This is compared with fully quantum simulations,
enabling an in-depth and contrasted analysis of transport measurements in
high-quality graphene-hBN superlattices. Our results not only highlight the
primary observation of the open-orbit induced XMR in this system but also shed
new light on other intricate phenomena. These include the nuances of single
miniband dynamics, evident through Lifshitz transitions, and the complex
interplay of semiclassical and quantum effects between these minibands.
Specifically, we document transport anomalies linked to trigonal warping, a
semiclassical deviation from the expected linear characteristics of Landau
levels, and magnetic breakdown phenomena indicative of quantum tunneling, all
effects jointly contributing to the intricacies of a rich electronic landscape
uncovered at low magnetic fields.

<p>The photonic spin Hall effect of light beams reflected from the surfaces of
various two-dimensional hexagonal crystalline structures, considering their
associated time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ and inversion $\mathcal{I}$ symmetries,
is investigated. Employing the Haldane model with tunable parameters as a
generic model, we examine the longitudinal and transverse spin-separations of
the reflected beam in both topological non-trivial and trivial systems. The
study reveals that the sign switching of the PSHE in these materials is
attributed to the non-trivial and trivial topology. By manipulating the
interplay between spin-orbit coupling and external electric fields, we
demonstrate topological phase transitions in buckled Xene monolayer materials
through the photonic spin Hall effect. Different behaviors of the photonic spin
Hall effect are observed in various topological phases within these materials.
Additionally, we explore the reflected spin and valley-polarized spatial shifts
in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The photonic spin Hall effect in
buckled Xene monolayer materials and transition metal dichalcogenides is highly
influenced by the spin and valley degrees of freedom of charge carriers,
offering a promising avenue to explore spintronics and valleytronics in these
hexagonal materials. We propose that the photonic spin Hall effect in Haldane
materials can serve as a metrological tool for optical parameter
characterization and as a promising method for determining Chern numbers and
topological phase transitions through direct optical weak measurement
techniques.

<h3>Effect of shear flow on the transverse thermal conductivity of polymer  melts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07027" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07027</a>
<br>
<i>Kotaro Oda, Shugo Yasuda</i>
<p>The effect of shear flows on the thermal conductivity of polymer melts is
investigated using a reversed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method.
We extended the original RNEMD method to simultaneously produce spatial
gradients of temperature and flow velocity in a single direction. This method
enables the accurate measurement of thermal conductivity in the transverse
direction to shear flow.
Our main finding is that the stress-thermal rule (STR) (i.e., the linear
relationship between anisotropic parts of the stress tensor and the thermal
conductivity tensor) holds for entangled polymer melts even under shear flows
but not for unentangled polymer melts. Furthermore, once entanglements form in
polymer chains, the coefficient of the STR (i.e., the stress-thermal
coefficient) remains independent of the polymer chain length.
These observations align with the theoretical foundation of the STR, which
focuses on energy transmission along the network structure of entangled polymer
chains [Brule, Rheol. Acta \textbf{28}, 257 (1989)]. However, under driven
shear flows, the stress-thermal coefficient is notably smaller than that
measured in the literature for a quasi-quiescent state without external forces.
Although the mechanism of the STR in shear flows has yet to be fully
elucidated, our study confirmed the validity of the STR in shear flows. This
allows us to use the STR as a constitutive equation for computational
thermo-fluid dynamics of polymer melts, thus offering broad engineering
applications.

<h3>Spatiotemporal visualization of a surface acoustic wave coupled to  magnons across a submillimeter-long sample by pulsed laser interferometry</h3>

<br>
<i>Kazuki Maezawa, Shun Fujii, Kazuto Yamanoi, Yukio Nozaki, Shinichi Watanabe</i>
<p>Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) coupled to magnons have attracted much
attention because they allow for the long-range transport of magnetic
information which cannot be achieved by magnon alone. We employed pulsed laser
interferometry to visualize the entire spatiotemporal dynamics of a SAW that
travels on a nickel (Ni) thin film and is coupled to magnons. It was possible
to trace the coupling-induced amplitude reduction and phase shift that occurs
as the SAW propagates over a distance of 0.4 mm. The observed changes are
consistent with results obtained from conventional radio-frequency transmission
measurements, which probe the total SAW absorption due to magnon--phonon
coupling. This result verifies that our method can accurately capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics of a SAW coupled to magnons across the entire length of
the sample. Additionally, we validated our time-resolved profiles by comparing
them with theoretical results that take the echo wave due to reflection into
account. The impact of the echo wave is significant even when it has propagated
over a distance on the order of millimeters. Our imaging results highlight the
visualization of the long-range propagation of the SAW coupled to magnons and
offer more information about the surface vibration profiles in such devices.

<p>Agricultural production heavily exploits the soil, resulting in high erosion
in cultivated land, which poses a threat to food security and environmental
sustainability. To address this issue, we stabilize the soil using polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA). PVA strongly adheres to the soil after mixing and annealing,
enhancing the cohesive strength of the soil. The PVA-soil withstands the impact
of water at 7 m/s, protecting it from rainfall-induced erosion. Furthermore,
the water-retaining capability and drainage of PVA-soil can be adjusted based
on its sizes. This customized PVA-soil provides optimal growing conditions for
various plants in different climates. Our method contributes to improved soil

<p>Field-induced superconductivity has long presented a counterintuitive
phenomenon and a pivotal challenge in condensed matter physics. In this Letter,
we introduce a mechanism for achieving field-induced superconductivity wherein
the sublattice degree of freedom and the Coulomb interaction are tightly
entwined. Our multipole-resolved analysis elucidates that lifting the
fluctuation degeneracy results in an unconventional Cooper pairing channel,
thereby realizing field-induced superconductivity. This research substantively
augments the exploration of the latent potential of strongly correlated
electron systems with sublattice degrees of freedom.

<p>X-ray circular dichroism, arising from the contrast in X-ray absorption
between opposite photon helicities, serves as a spectroscopic tool to measure
the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials and identify the handedness of
chiral crystals. Antiferromagnets with crystallographic chirality typically
lack X-ray magnetic circular dichroism because of time-reversal symmetry, yet
exhibit weak X-ray natural circular dichroism. Here, we report the observation
of giant natural circular dichroism in the Ni $L_3$-edge X-ray absorption of
Ni$_3$TeO$_6$, a polar and chiral antiferromagnet with effective time-reversal
symmetry. To unravel this intriguing phenomenon, we propose a phenomenological
model that classifies the movement of photons in a chiral crystal within the
same symmetry class as that of a magnetic field. The coupling of X-ray
polarization with the induced magnetization yields giant X-ray natural circular
dichroism, reflecting the magnetic susceptibility of Ni$_3$TeO$_6$. Our
findings provide evidence for the interplay between magnetism and crystal
chirality in natural optical activity. Additionally, we establish the first
example of a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting circular dichroism with
time-reversal symmetry.

<i>M. S. Bahovadinov, R. O. Sharipov, B. L. Altshuler, G. V. Shlyapnikov</i>
<p>In one dimension density-density interactions of particles reduce their
mobility and hence the Drude weight, which controls the divergence of the
optical conductivity at zero frequency, decreases. We study effects of pair
hopping events on this result in a 1D system of spinless fermions. The
considered model consists of the usual single-particle hopping and pair hopping
terms. In the absence of the density-density interactions, we first show that a
variation of the pair hopping amplitude results in a monotonic change of the
Drude weight. We next demonstrate that weak nearest-neighbor density-density
interactions increase the Drude weight, whereas in the regime of strong
interactions the Drude weight decreases as expected. Our numerical findings are
supported by bosonization results.

<h3>STM in the fractional quantum Hall effect: Spectroscopy of  composite-fermion bound states</h3>

<br>
<i>Mytraya Gattu, G. J. Sreejith, J. K. Jain</i>
<p>The fractional quantum Hall states are non-Fermi liquids of electrons, in
that their ground states and low energy excitations are described not in terms
of electrons but in terms of composite fermions which are bound states of
electrons and $2p$ quantized vortices. An electron or a hole at filling factor
$\nu=n/(2pn+1)$, where $p,n$ are integers, is a complex molecule of $2pn+ 1$
quasiparticles (excited composite fermions) or quasiholes (missing composite
fermions) and has its own internal excitations. Recent scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments have succeeded in measuring the electron spectral
functions of these states, which provides valuable information on the nature of
these strongly correlated molecules and thereby on the short-distance
correlations in the fractional quantum Hall liquids. These experiments exhibit
several sharp peaks in the tunneling spectra. Detailed calculations based on
the composite-fermion theory demonstrate multiple peaks in the local density of
states, and we argue that the separation between the peaks represents
interaction-corrected composite-fermion cyclotron energy. We discuss what
aspects of experiments are explained by our model and which ones remain to be
explained.

<h3>Sliding Dynamics of Current-Driven Skyrmion Crystal and Helix in Chiral  Magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07116" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07116</a>
<br>
<i>Ying-Ming Xie, Yizhou Liu, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<p>The skyrmion crystal (SkX) and helix (HL) phases, present in typical chiral
magnets, can each be considered as forms of density waves but with distinct
topologies. The SkX exhibits gyrodynamics analogous to electrons under a
magnetic field, while the HL state resembles topological trivial spin density
waves. However, unlike the charge density waves, the theoretical analysis of
the sliding motion of SkX and HL remains unclear, especially regarding the
similarities and differences in sliding dynamics between these two spin density
waves. In this work, we systematically explore the sliding dynamics of SkX and
HL in chiral magnets in the limit of large current density. We demonstrate that
the sliding dynamics of both SkX and HL can be unified within the same
theoretical framework as density waves, despite their distinct microscopic
orders. Furthermore, we highlight the significant role of gyrotropic sliding
induced by impurity effects in the SkX state, underscoring the impact of
nontrivial topology on the sliding motion of density waves. Our theoretical
analysis shows that the effect of impurity pinning is much stronger in HL
compared with SkX, i.e., $\chi^{SkX}/\chi^{HL}\sim \alpha^2$ ($\chi^{SkX}$,
$\chi^{HL}$: susceptibility to the impurity potential, $\alpha$ ($\ll 1$) is
the Gilbert damping). Moreover, the velocity correction is mostly in the
transverse direction to the current in SkX. These results are further
substantiated by realistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations.

<h3>Electrostatically controlled spin polarization in Graphene-CrSBr  magnetic proximity heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<i>Boxuan Yang, Bibek Bhujel, Daniel G. Chica, Evan J. Telford, Xavier Roy, Maxen Cosset-Chéneau, Bart J. van Wees</i>
<p>The magnetic proximity effect can induce a spin dependent exchange shift in
the band structure of graphene. This produces a magnetization and a spin
polarization of the electron/hole carriers in this material, paving the way for
its use as an active component in spintronics devices. The electrostatic
control of this spin polarization in graphene has however never been
demonstrated so far. We show that interfacing graphene with the van der Waals
antiferromagnet CrSBr results in an unconventional manifestation of the quantum
Hall effect, which can be attributed to the presence of counterflowing
spin-polarized edge channels originating from the spin-dependent exchange shift
in graphene. We extract an exchange shift ranging from 27 to 32 meV, and show
that it also produces an electrostatically tunable spin polarization of the
electron/hole carriers in graphene ranging from -50 % to +69 % in the absence
of a magnetic field. This proof of principle provides a starting point for the
use of graphene as an electrostatically tunable source of spin current and
could allow this system to generate a large magnetoresistance in gate tunable
spin valve devices.

<br>
<i>Alfonso Maiellaro, Hervé Aubin, Andrej Mesaros, Pascal Simon</i>
<p>Antiferromagnetic spin-1 chains host the celebrated symmetry protected
topological Haldane phase, whose spin-1/2 edge states were evidenced in bulk
by, e.g., Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). Recent success in assembling effective
spin-1 antiferromagnetic chains from nanographene and porphyrin molecules opens
the possibility of local, site-by-site, characterization. The nascent technique
of combined ESR-STM is able to measure the spin dynamics with atomic real-space
resolution, and could fully reveal and manipulate the spin-1/2 degree of
freedom. In this work, we combine exact diagonalization and DMRG to investigate
the local dynamic spin structure factor of the different phases of the
bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian with single-ion anisotropy in presence of an
external magnetic field. We find that the signature of the Haldane phase is a
low-energy peak created by singlet-triplet transitions in the edge-state
manifold. We predict that the signature peak is experimentally observable,
although for chains of length above N = 30 its energy should be first tuned by
application of external magnetic field. We fully characterize the peak in
real-space and energy, and further show its robustness to weak anisotropy and a
relevant range of temperatures.

<h3>Analysis of Thixotropic Timescale</h3>

<br>
<i>Yogesh M Joshi</i>
<p>Thixotropy is characterized by an increase in viscosity when a material is
subjected to no flow (quiescent) or weak flow conditions and a decrease in
viscosity when it is subjected to strong flow conditions. The characteristic
timescale associated with the thixotropic phenomenon, particularly how the
viscosity increases with time, has been termed the thixotropic timescale. In
the literature, several approaches have been suggested for estimating the
thixotropic timescale. The most prominent approach, however, infers it from a
specific form of a kinetic expression for structure parameter evolution. In
this paper, we study the various kinds of structural kinetic models, and by
carrying out a careful analysis of the same, we propose a universal candidate
parameter for the thixotropic timescale that is associated with the most
generic form of the kinetic expression for structure parameter evolution. We
observe that only when we consider the viscosity of the structural kinetic
model undergoes continuous increase with time and eventually diverges under
quiescent conditions, we can relate change in the thixotropic timescale to
change in the strength of the thixotropic phenomenon. Particularly for this
case, which we believe is the most practical scenario, our analysis suggests
that increasing the thixotropic timescale weakens the thixotropic character of
a system. We also propose a new phenomenological measure of the thixotropic
timescale: ${{\tau }_{thix}}={{\left( d\text{ln}\eta /dt \right)}^{-1}}$, where
$\eta $ is viscosity and $t$ is time. We believe that this definition agrees
well with the inherent concept of thixotropy that considers an increase in
viscosity as a function of time under no-flow conditions. The proposed
definition allows a straightforward and unique way to determine thixotropic
timescale through experiments and agrees well with the conventional notion of
thixotropy.

<br>
<i>Sindu B.S., Jan Hamaekers</i>
<p>Epoxy polymers are used in wide range of applications. The properties and
performance of epoxy polymers depend upon various factors like the type of
constituents and their proportions used and other process parameters. The
conventional way of developing epoxy polymers is usually labor-intensive and
may not be fully efficient, which has resulted in epoxy polymers having a
limited performance range due to the use of predetermined blend combinations,
compositions and development parameters. Hence, in order to experiment with
more design parameters, robust and easy computational techniques need to be
established. To this end, we developed and analyzed in this study a new machine
learning (ML) based approach to predict the mechanical properties of epoxy
polymers based on their basic structural features. The results from molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to derive the ML model. The salient
feature of our work is that for the development of epoxy polymers based on
EPON-862, several new hardeners were explored in addition to the conventionally
used ones. The influence of additional parameters like the proportion of curing
agent used and the extent of curing on the mechanical properties of epoxy
polymers were also investigated. This method can be further extended by
providing the epoxy polymer with the desired properties through knowledge of
the structural characteristics of its constituents. The findings of our study
can thus lead toward development of efficient design methodologies for epoxy
polymeric systems.

<h3>Quantum Hall coherent perfect absorption in graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07179" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07179</a>
<br>
<i>Dariush Jahani, Mohammadreza Alikhani, Yaser Abdi</i>
<p>100 % absorption in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with Dirac spectrum
is demonstrated to be obtained by controlling the interference of multiple
incident radiations, referred to as coherent perfect absorption (CPA). However,
when a 2DEG such as graphene is exposed to a magnetostatic bias, it resonantly
could absorb electromagnetic radiation by transitions of its Dirac electrons
between non-equidistant and nonlinear Landau levels. Here, the magneto-optical
terahertz (THz) CPA in graphene under the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime at
both strong and subtesla magnetostatic bias fields is addressed. Our findings
show that an effective magneto-optical surface conductivity corresponding to
right- and left-handed circular (RHC- and LHC) polarizations could model a
magneto-tunable CPA in graphene in THz range. Significantly, graphene under QHE
regime reveals different tunable CPA properties for each circularly polarized
beams by the intensity of the applied magnetic bias. Moreover, it is observed
that different phase modulations at CPA frequencies are achieved for RHC and
LHC polarizations. Considering the maximum efficiency for a 2D absorber, our
results demonstrate the magnetostatic tuning of CPA in 2D Dirac materials for
long-wavelength sensing applications and signal processing.

<h3>Charge-conserving equilibration of quantum Hall edge states</h3>

<br>
<i>Edvin G. Idrisov, Ivan P. Levkivskyi, Eugene V. Sukhorukov</i>
<p>We address the experimentally relevant situation, where a non-equilibrium
state is created at the edge of a quantum Hall system by injecting charge
current into a chiral edge state with the help of a quantum point contact,
quantum dots, or mesoscopic Ohmic contact. We show that the commonly accepted
picture of the full equilibration of a non-equilibrium state at finite
distances longer than a characteristic length scale contradicts to the charge
conservation requirement. We use a phenomenological transmission line model to
account for the local equilibration process and the charge and energy
conserving dynamics of the collective mode. By solving this model in the limit
of long distances $L$ from the injection point, we demonstrate that the
correction of the electron distribution function to its eventual equilibrium
form scales down slowly as $1/\sqrt{L}$.

<i>San-Dong Guo, Yu-Ling Tao, Zi-Yang Zhuo, Gangqiang Zhu, Yee Sin Ang</i>
<p>The combination of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics and anomalous valley
Hall effect (AVHE) is of great significance for potential applications in
valleytronics. Here, we propose a design principle for achieving AVHE in A-type
hexagonal AFM monolayer. The design principle involves the introduction of
layer-dependent electrostatic potential caused by out-of-plane external
electric field, which can break the combined symmetry ($PT$ symmetry) of
spatial inversion ($P$) and time reversal ($T$), producing spin splitting. The
spin order of spin splitting can be reversed by regulating the direction of
electric field. Based on first-principles calculations, the design principle
can be verified in AFM $\mathrm{Cr_2CH_2}$. The layer-locked hidden Berry
curvature can give rise to layer-Hall effect, including valley layer-spin Hall
effect and layer-locked AVHE. Our works provide an experimentally feasible way
to realize AVHE in AFM monolayer.

<br>
<i>Robert F. Schmidt, Henrik Kiefer, Robert Dalgliesh, Michael Gradzielski, Roland R. Netz</i>
<p>Deviations between macrorheological and particle-based microrheological
measurements are often considered a nuisance and neglected. We study aqueous
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) hydrogels for varying PEO concentrations and chain
lengths that contain microscopic tracer particles and show that these
deviations in fact reveal the nanoscopic viscoelastic properties of the
particle-hydrogel interface. Based on the transient Stokes equation, we first
demonstrate that the deviations are not due to finite particle radius,
compressibility or surface-slip effects. Small-angle neutron scattering rules
out hydrogel heterogeneities. Instead, we show that a generalized
Stokes-Einstein relation, accounting for a nanoscopic interfacial shell around
tracers with viscoelastic properties that significantly deviate from bulk,
consistently explains our macrorheological and microrheological measurements.
The extracted shell diameter is comparable with the PEO end-to-end distance,
indicating the importance of dangling chain ends. Our methodology reveals the
nanoscopic interfacial rheology of hydrogels and is generally applicable to
different kinds of viscoelastic fluids and particles.

<i>Xiangming Kong, Zhaolong Liu, Xiangqi Liu, Chunqiang Xu, Zhenhai Yu, Jing Wang, Baomin Wang, Xiaofeng Xu, Yanfeng Guo, Rui Zhang, Xiaofan Yang, Shiyan Li</i>
<p>We report an unusual evolution of superconductivity (SC) in the
three-dimensional Dirac semimetal PdTe with increasing pressure up to $\sim$50
GPa. The compressed PdTe exhibits a sudden reversal in the superconducting
transition temperature $T\mathrm{_c}$, from an initial decrease with pressure
to an increase above a critical pressure $P\mathrm{_c} \approx$ 15 GPa, showing
a V-shaped feature composed of SC-I and SC-II phases due to a structural phase
transition through $P\mathrm{_c}$. Subsequently, the $T\mathrm{_c}$ goes into a
plateau around 2.5 K when the pressure is higher than $\sim$32 GPa. In
addition, we find the variations of carrier concentrations and mobilities also
manifest a similar trend on the pressure response as the $T\mathrm{_c}$, and
the normal-state electronic properties change from the electron-dominated
single-band model to two-carrier model after the structural phase transition,
implying the close correlation between electronic properties and two SC phases.
Our findings establish the SC of PdTe is highly tunable under varying
pressures.

<h3>Chemically Active Wetting</h3>

<br>
<i>Susanne Liese, Xueping Zhao, Christoph A. Weber, Frank Jülicher</i>
<p>Wetting of liquid droplets on passive surfaces is ubiquitous in our daily
lives, and the governing physical laws are well-understood. When surfaces
become active, however, the governing laws of wetting remain elusive. Here we
propose chemically active wetting as a new class of active systems where the
surface is active due to a binding process that is maintained away from
equilibrium. We derive the corresponding non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory
and show that active binding fundamentally changes the wetting behavior,
leading to steady, non-equilibrium states with droplet shapes reminiscent of a
pancake or a mushroom. The origin of such anomalous shapes can be explained by
mapping to electrostatics, where pairs of binding sinks and sources correspond
to electrostatic dipoles along the triple line. This is an example of a more
general analogy, where localized chemical activity gives rise to a multipole
field of the chemical potential. The underlying physics is relevant for cells,
where droplet-forming proteins can bind to membranes accompanied by the
turnover of biological fuels.

<i>J. Liu, W. Xu, Y. M. Xiao, L. Ding, H. W. Li, F. M. Peeters</i>
<p>In this paper, we examined the effects of proximity-induced interactions such
as Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and effective Zeeman fields (EZFs) on the
optical spectrum of $n$-type and $p$-type monolayer (ML)-MoS$_2$. The optical
conductivity is evaluated using the standard Kubo formula under Random phase
approximation (RPA) with including the effective electron-electron interaction.
It has been found that there exists two absorption peaks in $n$-type
ML-MoS$_{2}$ and two knife shaped absorptions in $p$-type ML-MoS$_{2}$ which
are contributed by the inter-subband spin flip electronic transitions within
conduction and valence bands at valleys $K$ and $K'$ with a lifted valley
degeneracy. The optical absorptions in $n$-type and $p$-type ML-MoS$_{2}$ occur
in THz and infrared radiation regimes and the position, height, and shape of
them can be effectively tuned by Rashba parameter, EZFs parameters, and carrier
density. The interesting theoretical predictions in this study would be helpful
for the experimental observation of the optical absorption in infrared to THz
bandwidths contributed by inter-subband spin flip electronic transitions in a
lifted valley degeneracy monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs)
system. The obtained results indicate that ML-MoS$_{2}$ with the platform of
proximity interactions make it a promising infrared and THz material for optics
and optoelectronics.

<p>The charge loop current (cLC) state has attracted increasing attention in
kagome metals. Here, we calculate the spontaneous currents along the nearest
sites $i$ and $j$, $J_{i,j}$, induced by the cLC order that is the imaginary
and odd-parity hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}$. We reveal that the
magnitude of $J_{i,j}$ strongly depends on the nearest sites $i$ and $j$ in the
$2\times2$ cLC state, where $\eta\equiv |\delta t_{i,j}|$ is equivalent for all
nearest sites. The obtained $J_{i,j}$ becomes large near the van-Hove
singularity (vHS) filling ($n\sim n_{vHS}$) even when $\eta$ is fixed.
Interestingly, the obtained $J_{i,j}$ exhibits the logarithmic divergence
behavior at low temperatures for $n\sim n_{vHS}$ with a fixed $\eta$, by
reflecting the vHS points that are the characteristic of kagome metals. The
present study provides useful information for local electronic state
measurements, such as the site-selective NMR and STM experiments.

<p>We have shown recently that the notion of poking pairwise interactions along
a chain provides a unifying framework for understanding the formation of both
secondary and the tertiary protein structure based on symmetry and geometry.
$\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets are found to be special geometries that
have systematic poking contacts in a repetitive manner with the contacts being
local along the $\alpha$-helix and non-local along a pair of adjacent strands
within a $\beta$-sheet. Pairwise poking interactions also govern tertiary
structure formation, but they are weaker and there are no special geometrical
constraints as in secondary structure formation. Here we demonstrate that
protein turns, the most prevalent non-repetitive structural element in
proteins, are instances of local (as in $\alpha$-helices) and isolated
(non-repetitive) poking pairwise contacts for which the geometrical constraints
are partially relaxed. This simple and purely geometrical definition of protein
turns (also sometimes known as reverse turns, $\beta$-turns, $\beta$-bends,
hairpin bends, $3_{10}$ bends, kinks, widgets, ...) provides a simple framework
for unifying them. We present the results of a systematic analysis and identify
their structural classes as well as their respective amino acid preferences.

<h3>Structure of rotator phases formed in C$_{13}$-C$_{21}$ alkanes and  their mixtures: in bulk and in emulsion drops</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07301</a>

<p>Crystallization of alkane mixtures has been studied extensively for decades.
However, majority of the available data consider the behaviour of alkanes with
chain length of 21 C-atoms or more. Furthermore, important information about
the changes of the unit cell structure with temperature is practically absent.
In this work, the phase behavior of several pure alkanes $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$, with
$n$ ranging between 13 and 21, and their binary, ternary or multi-component
equimolar mixtures are investigated by X-ray scattering techniques. Both bulk
alkanes and oil-in-water emulsions of the same alkanes were studied. The
obtained results show formation of mixed rotator phases for all systems with
chain length difference between the neighbouring alkanes of $\Delta n \leqslant
3$. Partial demixing is observed when $\Delta n = 4 $, yet the main fraction of
the alkane molecules arranges in a mixed rotator phase in these samples. This
demixing is suppressed if an alkane with intermediate chain length is added to
the mixture. Interestingly, a steep temperature dependence of the interlamellar
spacing in mixed rotator phases was observed upon cooling at temperatures down
to 10{\deg}C below the melting temperature of the mixture. The volumetric
coefficient of thermal expansion of the rotator phases of mixed alkanes
(${\alpha}_{V} \approx 2$ x $10^{-3} {\deg}C ^{-1} $) is around 10 times bigger
compared to that of the rotator phases of pure alkanes. The experiments
performed with emulsion drops containing the same alkane mixture while
stabilized by different surfactants, showed that the surfactant template also
affects the final lattice spacing which is observed at low temperatures. In
contrast, no such dependence was observed for drops stabilized by the same
surfactant while having different initial diameters - in this case only the
initial temperature of the crystallization onset was affected.

<p>We present a geometrical analysis of the protrusion statistics of side chains
in more than 4,000 high-resolution protein structures. We find that when the
amino acids are grouped based on chemical similarity, the resulting groups
equally well fit the geometrical attributes in a harmonious manner. Our
analysis underscores the role of minimal frustration in the evolution of
protein sequences that fit within a pre-sculpted menu of putative native state

<h3>First-principles exploration of superconductivity in intercalated  bilayer borophene phases</h3>

<br>
<i>Božidar N. Šoškić, Jonas Bekaert, Cem Sevik, Željko Šljivančanin, Milorad V. Milošević</i>
<p>We explore the emergence of phonon-mediated superconductivity in bilayer
borophenes by controlled intercalation with elements from the groups of alkali,
alkaline-earth, and transition metals, using systematic first-principles and
Eliashberg calculations. We show that the superconducting properties are
primarily governed by the interplay between the out-of-plane ($p_{z}$) boron
states and the partially occupied in-plane ($s+p_{x,y}$) bonding states at the
Fermi level. Our Eliashberg calculations indicate that intercalation with
alkaline-earth elements leads to the highest superconducting critical
temperatures ($T_{c}$). Specifically, Be in $\delta_{4}$, Mg in $\chi_{3}$, and
Ca in the kagome bilayer borophene demonstrate superior performance with
$T_{c}$ reaching up to 27 K. Our study therefore reveals that intercalated
bilayer borophene phases are not only more resilient to chemical deterioration,
but also harbor enhanced $T_{c}$ values compared to their monolayer
counterparts, underscoring their substantial potential for the development of
boron-based two-dimensional superconductors.

<p>With increasing attention in Majorana physics for possible quantum bit
applications, a large interest has been developed to understand the properties
of the interface between a $s$-type superconductor and a topological insulator.
Up to this point the interface analysis was mainly focused on in situ prepared
Josephson junctions, which consist of two coupled single interfaces or to
ex-situ fabricated single interface devices. In our work we utilize a novel
fabrication process, combining selective area growth and shadow evaporation
which allows the characterization of a single in situ fabricated
Nb/$\mathrm{(Bi_{0.15}Sb_{0.85})_2Te_3}$ nano interface. The resulting high
interface transparency is apparent by a zero bias conductance increase by a
factor of 1.7. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive differential conductance
analysis of our single in situ interface for various magnetic fields,
temperatures and gate voltages. Additionally, density functional theory
calculations of the superconductor/topological insulator interface are
performed in order to explain the peak-like shape of our differential
conductance spectra and the origin of the observed smearing of conductance
features.

<p>One-dimensional (1D) van der Waals materials have emerged as an intriguing
playground to explore novel electronic and optical effects. We report on
inorganic one-dimensional SbPS4 nanotubes bundles obtained via mechanical
exfoliation from bulk crystals. The ability to mechanically exfoliate SbPS4
nanobundles offers the possibility of applying modern 2D material fabrication
techniques to create mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. We find
that SbPS4 can readily be exfoliated to yield long (> 10 {\mu}m) nanobundles
with thicknesses that range from of 1.3 - 200 nm. We investigated the optical
response of semiconducting SbPS4 nanobundles and discovered that upon
excitation with blue light, they emit bright and ultra-broadband red light with
a quantum yield similar to that of hBN-encapsulated MoSe2. We discovered that
the ultra-broadband red light emission is a result of a large ~1 eV exciton
binding energy and a ~200 meV exciton self-trapping energy, unprecedented in
previous material studies. Due to the bright and ultra-broadband light
emission, we believe that this class of inorganic 1D van der Waals
semiconductors has numerous potential applications including on-chip tunable
nanolasers, and applications that require ultra-violet to visible light
conversion such as lighting and sensing. Overall, our findings open avenues for
harnessing the unique characteristics of these nanomaterials, advancing both
fundamental research and practical optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Strain fingerprinting of exciton valley character</h3>

<p>Momentum-indirect excitons composed of electrons and holes in different
valleys define optoelectronic properties of many semiconductors, but are
challenging to detect due to their weak coupling to light. The identification
of an excitons' valley character is further limited by complexities associated
with momentum-selective probes. Here, we study the photoluminescence of
indirect excitons in controllably strained prototypical 2D semiconductors
(WSe$_2$, WS$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures. We find that these excitons i)
exhibit valley-specific energy shifts, enabling their valley fingerprinting,
and ii) hybridize with bright excitons, becoming directly accessible to optical
spectroscopy methods. This approach allows us to identify multiple previously
inaccessible excitons with wavefunctions residing in K, $\Gamma$, or Q valleys
in the momentum space as well as various types of defect-related excitons.
Overall, our approach is well-suited to unravel and tune intervalley excitons
in various semiconductors.

<h3>Giant domain wall anomalous Hall effect in an antiferromagnet</h3>

<p>The Hall effect plays a crucial role in establishment of band theory of
solids and discovery of emergent new phases of interacting electrons such as
the topological phases of matter. Generally, the dissipationless Hall effect
requires time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), where TRSB induced by external
magnetic field results in ordinary Hall effect, while TRSB caused by
spontaneous magnetization gives rise to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) which
scales with the net magnetization. The AHE is therefore not expected in
antiferromagnets with vanishing small magnetization. However, large AHE was
recently observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncolinear spin structure
and nonvanishing Berry curvature, thus opening a new area for exploration of
large AHE in antiferromagnets. Here, we report another origin of AHE in a
layered antiferromagnet, namely the domain wall (DW) skew scattering with Weyl
points near the Fermi level, in experiments for the first time. Interestingly,
the DWs form a unique periodic stripe structure with controllable periodicity
by external magnetic field, which decreases nearly monotonically from 975 nm at
0 T to 232 nm at 4 T. Electrons incident on DW with topological bound states
experience strong asymmetric scattering, leading to giant extrinsic AHE, with
the DW Hall conductivity (DWHC) at 2 K and 1.2 T even reaching a record value
of about 1.51*104 S cm-1 among bulk systems, which is two orders of magnitude
larger than the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity. The observation of giant
DWHC and controllable stripe DW structure in an antiferromagnet not only sets a
new paradigm for exploration of large extrinsic anomalous Hall effect, but also
provides potential applications in spintronic devices.

<p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at
pressures above 14 GPa has spurred extensive research efforts. Yet, fundamental
aspects of the superconducting phase, including the possibility of a
filamentary character, are currently subjects of controversial debates.
Conversely, a crystal structure with NiO$_6$ octahedral bilayers stacked along
the $c$-axis direction was consistently posited in initial studies on
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here we reassess this structure in optical floating
zone-grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals that show signs of filamentary
superconductivity. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy and
single-crystal x-ray diffraction under high pressures, we observe multiple
crystallographic phases in these crystals, with the majority phase exhibiting
alternating monolayers and trilayers of NiO$_6$ octahedra, signifying a
profound deviation from the previously suggested bilayer structure. Using
density functional theory, we disentangle the individual contributions of the
monolayer and trilayer structural units to the electronic band structure of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, providing a firm basis for advanced theoretical modeling and
future evaluations of the potential of the monolayer-trilayer structure for
hosting superconductivity.

<h3>Quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional superconductors: a review  on recent experimental progress</h3>

<p>Superconductor-insulator/metal transition (SIT/SMT) as a paradigm of quantum
phase transition has been a research highlight over the last three decades.
Benefit from recent developments in the fabrication and measurements of 2D
superconducting films and nanodevices, unprecedented quantum phenomena have
been revealed in the quantum phase transitions of 2D superconductors. In this
review, we introduce the recent progress on quantum phase transitions in 2D
superconductors, focusing on the quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) and
anomalous metal state. Characterized by a divergent critical exponent when
approaching zero temperature, QGS of SMT is discovered in ultrathin crystalline
Ga films and subsequently detected in various 2D superconductors. The
universality of QGS indicates the profound influence of quenched disorder on
quantum phase transitions. Besides, in a 2D superconducting system, whether a
metallic ground state can exist is a long-sought mystery. Recently, the
charge-2e quantum oscillations are observed in nanopatterned superconducting
films, indicating the bosonic nature of the anomalous metal state and ending
the debate on whether bosons can exist as a metal. The evidences of the
anomalous metal states have also been reported in crystalline epitaxial thin
films and exfoliated nanoflakes, as well as granular composite films. High
quality filters are used in these works to exclude the influence of external
high frequency noises in ultralow temperature measurements. The observations of
QGS and metallic ground states in 2D superconductors not only reveal the
prominent role of quantum fluctuations and dissipations but also provide new
perspective to explore quantum phase transitions in superconducting systems.

<p>Here we report on Landau level spectroscopy of an epitaxially grown thin film
of the topological insulator Sb2Te3, complemented by ellipsometry and
magneto-transport measurements. The observed response suggests that Sb2Te3 is a
direct-gap semiconductor with the fundamental band gap located at the \Gamma
point, or along the trigonal axis, and its width reaches Eg = 190 meV at low
temperatures. Our data also indicate the presence of other low-energy extrema
with a higher multiplicity in both the conduction and valence bands. The
conclusions based on our experimental data are confronted with and to a great
extent corroborated by the electronic band structure calculated using the GW
method.

<i>Antony Jeyaseelan A, Sandip Bysakh, Jalaja M A, Soma Dutta</i>
<p>This paper reports the impact of process-dependent structural deformation and
lattice strain by doping, resulting in domain re-orientation along the a-axis.
For this investigation, the smaller La3+ cation is introduced at A-site and the
longitudinal and transverse piezocoefficient properties have been studied in
Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) film. Introducing smaller cations at the A-site leads to a
reduction in the lattice parameter and improves the lattice matching with the
Pt substrate. The XRD and HRTEM studies evidence this occurrence in both films.
The HRTEM analysis also reveals the 30{\deg} long-range ordered domain
alignment due to the lattice mismatch and 0{\deg} match domain alignment with
the substrate in PZT and PLZT films respectively. The strain-induced 30{\deg}
domain alignment in PZT enhances the longitudinal (d33d), whereas 0{\deg}
domain alignment in PLZT enhances the transverse (d31) piezocoefficient
properties. Incorporating 8% of La in the PZT lattice leads to a two-fold
increase in the d31 value compared to PZT film.

<p>In this study, we present a comprehensive exploration of formation of
different phases in lipid molecules using a coarse-grained implicit solvent
model, where each lipid molecule is represented as a rigid, three-bead rod-like
structure. Our study not only successfully replicates the spontaneous
self-assembly of lipid bilayers but also elucidates the intricate phase
transitions between the gel phase, liquid phase, and the elusive ripple
phase(Pbeta). Specifically, we uncover the pivotal role of molecular rigidity
in promoting the formation of the ripple phase. The significance of our
findings lies in their potential to reshape our understanding of lipid bilayer
dynamics and phase transitions. By shedding light on the ripple phase, a phase
previously difficult to simulate convincingly, the insights gained from this
study have the potential to guide future investigations into the behavior of
biological membranes and their role in cellular processes.

<br>
<i>Tara N. Tošić, Arkadiy Simonov, Nicola A. Spaldin</i>
<p>We use a combination of first-principles density functional calculations and
spin-dynamics simulations to explain the unusual diffuse inelastic neutron
scattering in the hexagonal multiferroic yttrium manganite, YMnO$_3$. Using
symmetry considerations, we construct a model spin Hamiltonian with parameters
derived from our density functional calculations and show that it captures the
measured behavior. We then show that the observed directionality in the
structured diffuse scattering in momentum space is a hallmark of the triangular
geometry, and that its persistence across a wide range of temperatures, both
above and below the N\'eel temperature, T$_\text{N}$, is a result of the strong
magnetic frustration. We predict that this diffuse scattering exists in a
yet-to-be-observed modulated continuum of energies, that its associated spin
excitations have distinct in-plane and out-of-plane character and that the
frustration influences the magnetism below the N\'eel temperature. Finally, we
show that visualizing the magnetic order in terms of composite trimer
magnetoelectric monopoles and toroidal moments, rather than individual spins,
provides insight into the real space fluctuations, revealing clusters of
emerging order in the paramagnetic state, as well as collective short-range
excitations in the ordered antiferromagnetic phase. Our understanding of this
directional diffuse scattering in such a wide temperature range, both below and
above T$_\text{N}$, provides new insight into the magnetic phase transitions in
frustrated systems.

<br>
<i>Laura Guislain, Eric Bertin</i>
<p>In a statistical physics context, inverse problems consists in determining
microscopic interactions such that a system reaches a predefined collective
state. A complex collective state may be prescribed by specifying the overlap
distribution between microscopic configurations, a notion originally introduced
in the context of disordered systems like spin-glasses. We show that in spite
of the absence of disorder, nonequilibrium spin models exhibiting spontaneous
magnetization oscillations provide a benchmark to prescribe a non-trivial
overlap distribution with continuous support, qualitatively analogous to the
ones found in disordered systems with full replica symmetry breaking. The
overlap distribution can be explicitly tailored to take a broad range of
predefined shapes by monitoring the spin dynamics. The presence of a
non-trivial overlap distribution is traced back to an average over infinitely
many pure states, a feature shared with spin-glasses.

<br>
<i>Zhi-Xing Lin, Shu Zhang</i>
<p>The stacking of intrinsically magnetic van der Waals materials provides a
fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting
significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having
topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope
of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer
ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and
study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic
couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic
transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to
parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a
transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results
in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The
magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst
coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.

<br>
<i>L. F. C. Faria, Victor L. Quito, João C. Getelina, José A. Hoyos, E. Miranda</i>
<p>We study the spin transport properties of some disordered spin chains with a
special focus on the distribution of the frequency-dependent spin conductivity.
In the cases of interest here, the systems are governed by an effectively
infinite disorder at low energies. A hallmark of this behavior is the wide
discrepancy between the average and the typical values of some physical
quantities, which are described by extremely broad distributions. We show that
such is also the case of the spin conductivity, whose average value is metallic
but whose typical one, the physically relevant quantity, is insulating. This
solves the apparent contradiction between the prediction of a spin metallic
phase of the spin-1/2 disordered XX chain and its known localized behavior
(after a mapping to free fermions). Our results are based on analytical and
numerical implementations of a strong-disorder renormalization group as well as
exact diagonalization studies. We present our analyses in very general terms,
valid for systems of any spin $S$ value, but the cases of $S=1/2$ and 1 are
studied in greater detail.

<p>We report the mechanical properties of cubic boron nitride (c-BN) and diamond
under the combined impact of dynamical pressure and temperature, calculated
using ab initio molecular dynamics. Our study revealed a pronounced sensitivity
of the mechanical properties of c-BN to applied pressure. Notably, c-BN
undergoes a brittle-to-ductile transition at ~220 GPa, consistent across
various dynamical temperatures, while diamond exhibits no such transition.
Furthermore, the Vickers hardness profile for c-BN closely mirrors that of
diamond across a spectrum of temperature-pressure conditions, highlighting
c-BN's significant mechanical robustness. These results underscore the superior
resilience and adaptability of c-BN compared to diamond, suggesting its
potential as an ideal candidate for applications in extreme environments.

<p>We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of cylindrical quantum

obtain the bound energy eigenstates of particles in a three-dimensional

closed boundary conditions in the radial and the axial directions. In the
present model we consider carriers with continuous mass distributions within
the dot with abrupt mass discontinuities at the barriers, moving in a quantum
dot that connects different substances. Continuity of mass and potential at the
interfaces with the external layers result as a particular case. Our approach
is mostly analytical and allows a precise comparison among von Roos ordering
classes.

Here, the shape memory alloy NiTi, in a near equiatomic composition, was
investigated to deconvolve the material response from macroscopic component
effects. Specifically, stress-geometry interactions were revealed, in-situ, for
a minaturised cardiovascular stent subjected to an externally applied
cylindrical stress whilst acquiring synchrotron X-ray imaging and diffraction
data. The approach enabled the collection of spatially resolved micromechanical
deformation data; the formation of stress-induced martensite and R-phase was
evident, occurring in locations near junctions between stent ligaments where
stress concentrations exist. In the as-fabricated condition, hardness maps were
obtained through nanoindentation, demonstrating that the localised deformation
and deformation patterning is further controlled by porosity and
microstructural heterogeneity. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
supported these observations, showing a finer grain structure near stent
junctions with higher associated lattice curvature. These features, combined
with stress concentrations when loaded will initiate localised phase
transformations. If the stent was subjected to repeated loading, representing
in-vivo conditions, these regions would be susceptible to cyclic damage through
transformation memory loss, leading to premature component failure. This study
highlights the challenges that must be addressed for the post-processing
treatment of LABF-processed stents for healthcare-related applications.

<h3>Current-controlled chirality dynamics in a mesoscopic magnetic domain  wall</h3>

<p>We show that the chirality as internal degree of freedom of a mesoscopic
domain wall inside a quasi-one-dimensional fixture can be controlled by
spin-polarized current for ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic domain walls,
and for recently discovered novel class of magnetic materials -- altermagnets
-- chirality switching can be driven by usual (unpolarized) charge current.
Further, we show that the current density required for the chirality
manipulation can be significantly reduced in the low-temperature regime if the
chirality dynamics is essentially quantum. In the quantum regime, weak currents
can excite Bloch oscillations of the domain wall angular rotation velocity with
the frequency proportional to the current, modulated by a much higher
magnon-range frequency. A controlled switching between different chiral states
is possible as well.

<h3>Magnetic quantum oscillations of in-plane Hall conductivity and  magnetoresistance tensor in quasi-two-dimensional metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07496</a>
<br>
<i>Pavel D. Grigoriev, Taras I. Mogilyuk</i>
<p>We develop the theory of magnetoresistance oscillations in layered
quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metals. Using the Kubo-Streda formula, we
calculate the Hall intralayer conductivity in a magnetic field perpendicular to
conducting layers. The analytical expressions for the amplitudes and phases of
magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) and of the difference or the so-called slow
oscillations (SO) are derived as a function of several parameters: magnetic
field strength, interlayer transfer integral, temperature, and the electron
mean-free time. We calculate the quantum oscillations of the magnetoresistance
tensor, because the magnetoresistance rather than conductivity is usually
measured. We also discuss the averaging of magnetoresistance oscillations over
MQO period due to finite temperature and long-range sample inhomogeneities. The
results obtained are useful to analyze experimental data on magnetoresistance
oscillations in various quasi-2D metals.

<h3>Fluctuation relations for a few observable currents at their own beat</h3>

<i>Alberto Garilli, Pedro E. Harunari, Matteo Polettini</i>
<p>Coarse-grained models are widely used to explain the effective behavior of
partially observable physical systems with hidden degrees of freedom. Reduction
procedures in state space typically disrupt Markovianity and a fluctuation
relation cannot be formulated. A recently developed framework of
transition-based coarse-graining gave rise to a fluctuation relation for a
single current, while all others are hidden. Here, we extend the treatment to
an arbitrary number of observable currents. Crucial for the derivation are the
concepts of mixed currents and their conjugated effective affinities, that can
be inferred from the time series of observable transitions. We also discuss the
connection to generating functions, transient behavior, and how our result
recovers the fluctuation relation for a complete set of currents.

<h3>On-demand population of Andreev levels by their ionization in the  presence of Coulomb blockade</h3>

<p>A mechanism to deterministically prepare a nanowire Josephson junction in an
odd parity state is proposed. The mechanism involves population of two Andreev
levels by a resonant microwave drive breaking a Cooper pair, and a subsequent
ionization of one of the levels by the same drive. Robust preparation of the
odd state is allowed by a residual Coulomb repulsion in the junction. A similar
resonant process can also be used to prepare the junction in the even state.
Our theory explains a recent experiment [J. J. Wesdorp, et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 131, 117001 (2023)].

<h3>Quantum Anomalous Hall and Spin Hall Effects in Magnetic Graphene</h3>

<i>Talieh S. Ghiasi, Davit Petrosyan, Josep Ingla-Aynés, Tristan Bras, Samuel Mañas-Valero, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Eugenio Coronado, Herre S. J. van der Zant</i>
<p>A promising approach to attain long-distance coherent spin propagation is
accessing quantum Hall topological spin-polarized edge states in graphene.
Achieving this without large external magnetic fields necessitates engineering
graphene band structure, obtainable through proximity to 2D magnetic materials.
In this work, we detect spin-polarized helical edge transport in graphene at
zero external magnetic field, allowed by the out-of-plane magnetic proximity of
CrPS$_4$ that spin-splits the zeroth Landau level. This zero-field detection of
the quantum anomalous spin Hall state is enabled by large induced spin-orbit
and exchange couplings in the graphene that also lead to the detection of an
enhanced Berry curvature, shifting the Landau levels, and result in an
unconventional sequence of quantum Hall plateaus. Remarkably, we observe that
the quantum anomalous Hall transport in the magnetized graphene persists up to
room temperature. The detection of spin-polarized helical edge states at zero
magnetic field and the robustness of the quantum anomalous Hall transport up to
room temperature open the route for practical applications of magnetic graphene
in quantum information processing and spintronic circuitries.
